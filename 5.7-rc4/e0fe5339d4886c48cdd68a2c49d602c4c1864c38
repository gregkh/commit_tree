mtd: spi-nor: Clear WEL bit when erase or program errors occur

When an Erase or Program error occurs on a spansion/cypress or a
micron flash, the WEL bit remains set to one and should be cleared
with a WRDI command in order to protect against inadvertent writes
that can possible corrupt the contents of the memory.

Winbond, macronix, gd, etc., do not support the E_ERR and P_ERR bits in the
Status Register and always clear the WEL bit regardless of the outcome
of the erase or page program operation (ex w25q40bw, MX25L25635E).

Issue a WRDI command when erase or page program errors occur.
