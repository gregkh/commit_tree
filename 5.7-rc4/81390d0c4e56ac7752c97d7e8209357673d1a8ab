hsr: remove unnecessary rcu_read_lock() in hsr module

In order to access the port list, the hsr_port_get_hsr() is used.
And this is protected by RTNL and RCU.
The hsr_fill_info(), hsr_check_carrier(), hsr_dev_open() and
hsr_get_max_mtu() are protected by RTNL.
So, rcu_read_lock() in these functions are not necessary.
The hsr_handle_frame() also uses rcu_read_lock() but this function
is called by packet path.
It's already protected by RCU.
So, the rcu_read_lock() in hsr_handle_frame() can be removed.
