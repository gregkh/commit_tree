hugetlb_cgroup: support noreserve mappings

Support MAP_NORESERVE accounting as part of the new counter.

For each hugepage allocation, at allocation time we check if there is a
reservation for this allocation or not.  If there is a reservation for
this allocation, then this allocation was charged at reservation time, and
we don't re-account it.  If there is no reserevation for this allocation,
we charge the appropriate hugetlb_cgroup.

The hugetlb_cgroup to uncharge for this allocation is stored in
page[3].private.  We use new APIs added in an earlier patch to set this
pointer.
