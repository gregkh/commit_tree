rcutorture: Fix stray access to rcu_fwd_cb_nodelay

The rcu_fwd_cb_nodelay variable suppresses excessively long read-side
delays while carrying out an rcutorture forward-progress test.  As such,
it is accessed both by readers and updaters, and most of the accesses
therefore use *_ONCE().  Except for one in rcu_read_delay(), which this
commit fixes.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to this being rcutorture.
