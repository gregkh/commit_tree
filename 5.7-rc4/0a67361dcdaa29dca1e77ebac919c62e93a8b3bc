efi/x86: Remove runtime table address from kexec EFI setup data

Since commit 33b85447fa61946b ("efi/x86: Drop two near identical versions
of efi_runtime_init()"), we no longer map the EFI runtime services table
before calling SetVirtualAddressMap(), which means we don't need the 1:1
mapped physical address of this table, and so there is no point in passing
the address via EFI setup data on kexec boot.

Note that the kexec tools will still look for this address in sysfs, so
we still need to provide it.
