cpu-topology: Fix the potential data corruption

Currently there are only 10 bytes to store the cpu-topology 'name'
information. Only 10 bytes copied into cluster/thread/core names.

If the cluster ID exceeds 2-digit number, it will result in the data
corruption, and ending up in a dead loop in the parsing routines. The
same applies to the thread names with more that 3-digit number.

This issue was found using the boundary tests under virtualised
environment like QEMU.

Let us increase the buffer to fix such potential issues.
