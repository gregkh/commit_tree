tools/runqslower: Ensure own vmlinux.h is picked up first

Reorder include paths to ensure that runqslower sources are picking up
vmlinux.h, generated by runqslower's own Makefile. When runqslower is built
from selftests/bpf, due to current -I$(BPF_INCLUDE) -I$(OUTPUT) ordering, it
might pick up not-yet-complete vmlinux.h, generated by selftests Makefile,
which could lead to compilation errors like [0]. So ensure that -I$(OUTPUT)
goes first and rely on runqslower's Makefile own dependency chain to ensure
vmlinux.h is properly completed before source code relying on it is compiled.
