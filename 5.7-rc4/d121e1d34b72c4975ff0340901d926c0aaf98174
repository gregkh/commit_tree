libbpf: Ignore incompatible types with matching name during CO-RE relocation

When finding target type candidates, ignore forward declarations, functions,
and other named types of incompatible kind. Not doing this can cause false
errors.  See [0] for one such case (due to struct pt_regs forward
declaration).
