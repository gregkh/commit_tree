PM / hibernate: Remove unnecessary compat ioctl overrides

Since the SNAPSHOT_GET_IMAGE_SIZE, SNAPSHOT_AVAIL_SWAP_SIZE, and
SNAPSHOT_ALLOC_SWAP_PAGE ioctls produce an loff_t result, and loff_t is
always 64-bit even in the compat case, there's no reason to have the
special compat handling for these ioctls.  Just remove this unneeded
code so that these ioctls call into snapshot_ioctl() directly, doing
just the compat_ptr() conversion on the argument.

(This unnecessary code was also causing a KMSAN false positive.)
