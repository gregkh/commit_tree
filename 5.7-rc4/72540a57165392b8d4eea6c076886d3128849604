platform/chrome: cros_ec_sysfs: Use cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status helper

This patch makes use of cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status() instead of
cros_ec_cmd_xfer(). In this case the change is trivial and the only
reason to do it is because we want to make cros_ec_cmd_xfer() a private
function for the EC protocol and let people only use the
cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status() to return Linux standard error codes.

Looking at the code I am even unsure that makes sense differentiate
these two errors but let's not change the behaviour for now.
