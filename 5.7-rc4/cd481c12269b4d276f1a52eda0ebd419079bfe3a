dm clone: Add overflow check for number of regions

Add overflow check for clone->nr_regions variable, which holds the
number of regions of the target.

The overflow can occur with sufficiently large devices, if BITS_PER_LONG
== 32. E.g., if the region size is 8 sectors (4K), the overflow would
occur for device sizes > 34359738360 sectors (~16TB).

This could result in multiple device sectors wrongly mapping to the same
region number, due to the truncation from 64 bits to 32 bits, which
would lead to data corruption.
