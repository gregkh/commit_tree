tools: bpftool: Fix minor bash completion mistakes

Minor fixes for bash completion: addition of program name completion for
two subcommands, and correction for program test-runs and map pinning.

The completion for the following commands is fixed or improved:

    # bpftool prog run [TAB]
    # bpftool prog pin [TAB]
    # bpftool map pin [TAB]
    # bpftool net attach xdp name [TAB]
