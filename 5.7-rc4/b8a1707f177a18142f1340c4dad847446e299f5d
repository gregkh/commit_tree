docs: dt: fix broken reference to phy-cadence-torrent.yaml

This file was removed, and another file was added instead of
it, on two separate commits.

Splitting a single logical change (doc conversion) on two
patches is a bad thing, as it makes harder to discover what
crap happened.

Anyway, this patch fixes the broken reference, making it
pointing to the new location of the file.

Fixes: c6d8eef38b7f ("dt-bindings: phy: Add Cadence MHDP PHY bindings in YAML format.")
