usb: typec: Add definitions for Thunderbolt 3 Alternate Mode

This adds separate header file for the Thunderbolt 3
Alternate Mode (aka. TBT). The header supplies definitions for
all the Thunderbolt specific VDOs (Vendor Defined Objects)
that are described in the USB Type-C Connector specification
v2.0, as well as definition for the Thunderbolt 3 Standard
ID (SID).

There is also a new connector state value for the
Thunderbolt 3 Alternate Mode that can be used with the mux
drivers.
