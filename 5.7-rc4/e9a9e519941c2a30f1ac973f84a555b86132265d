ptp: Remove unneeded conversion to bool

The '==' expression itself is bool, no need to convert it to bool again.
This fixes the following coccicheck warning:

drivers/ptp/ptp_ines.c:403:55-60: WARNING: conversion to bool not
needed here
drivers/ptp/ptp_ines.c:404:55-60: WARNING: conversion to bool not
needed here
