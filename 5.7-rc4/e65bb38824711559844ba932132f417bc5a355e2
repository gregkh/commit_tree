mmc: sdhci: do not enable card detect interrupt for gpio cd type

Except SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION and MMC_CAP_NONREMOVABLE,
we also do not need to handle controller native card detect interrupt
for gpio cd type.
If we wrong enabled the card detect interrupt for gpio case, it will
cause a lot of unexpected card detect interrupts during data transfer
which should not happen.
