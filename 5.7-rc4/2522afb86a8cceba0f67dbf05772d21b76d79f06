libnvdimm/region: Introduce an 'align' attribute

The align attribute applies an alignment constraint for namespace
creation in a region. Whereas the 'align' attribute of a namespace
applied alignment padding via an info block, the 'align' attribute
applies alignment constraints to the free space allocation.

The default for 'align' is the maximum known memremap_compat_align()
across all archs (16MiB from PowerPC at time of writing) multiplied by
the number of interleave ways if there is blk-aliasing. The minimum is
PAGE_SIZE and allows for the creation of cross-arch incompatible
namespaces, just as previous kernels allowed, but the expectation is
cross-arch and mode-independent compatibility by default.

The regression risk with this change is limited to cases that were
dependent on the ability to create unaligned namespaces, *and* for some
reason are unable to opt-out of aligned namespaces by writing to
'regionX/align'. If such a scenario arises the default can be flipped
from opt-out to opt-in of compat-aligned namespace creation, but that is
a last resort. The kernel will otherwise continue to support existing
defined misaligned namespaces.

Unfortunately this change needs to touch several parts of the
implementation at once:

- region/available_size: expand busy extents to current align
- region/max_available_extent: expand busy extents to current align
- namespace/size: trim free space to current align

...to keep the free space accounting conforming to the dynamic align
setting.
