mm/sparse.c: add note about only VMEMMAP supporting sub-section hotplug

And tell check_pfn_span() gating the porper alignment and size of hot
added memory region.

And also move the code comments from inside section_deactivate() to being
above it.  The code comments are reasonable for the whole function, and
the moving makes code cleaner.
