dm writecache: implement the "cleaner" policy

The "flush" or "flush_on_suspend" messages flush the whole cache. However,
these flushing methods can take some time and the process is left in
an interruptible state during the flush.

Implement a "cleaner" option that offers an alternate flushing method.
When this option is activated (either by a message or in the constructor
arguments), the cache will not promote new writes (however, writes to
already cached blocks are promoted, to avoid data corruption due to
misordered writes) and it will gradually writeback any cached data. The
userspace can then monitor the cleaning process with "dmsetup status".
When the number of cached bloks drops to zero, the userspace can unload
the dm-writecache target and replace it with dm-linear or other targets.
