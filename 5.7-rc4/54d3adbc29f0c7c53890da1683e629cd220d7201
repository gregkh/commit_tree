ext4: save all error info in save_error_info() and drop ext4_set_errno()

Using a separate function, ext4_set_errno() to set the errno is
problematic because it doesn't do the right thing once
s_last_error_errorcode is non-zero.  It's also less racy to set all of
the error information all at once.  (Also, as a bonus, it shrinks code
size slightly.)
