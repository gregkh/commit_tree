xfs: mark extended attr corrupt when lookup-by-hash fails

In xchk_xattr_listent, we attempt to validate the extended attribute
hash structures by performing a attr lookup by (hashed) name.  If the
lookup returns ENODATA, that means that the hash information is corrupt.
The _process_error functions don't catch this, so we have to add that
explicitly.
