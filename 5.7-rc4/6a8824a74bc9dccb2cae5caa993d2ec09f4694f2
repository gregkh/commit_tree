RDMA/cm: Allow ib_send_cm_sidr_rep() to be done under lock

The first thing ib_send_cm_sidr_rep() does is obtain the lock, so use the
usual unlocked wrapper, locked actor pattern here.

Get rid of the cm_reject_sidr_req() wrapper so each call site can call the
locked or unlocked version as required.

This avoids a sketchy lock/unlock sequence (which could allow state to
change) during cm_destroy_id().
