ASoC: soc-pcm: tidyup soc_pcm_open() order

soc_pcm_open() operation order is not good.
At first, soc_pcm_open() operation order is

	1) CPU DAI startup
	2) Component open
	3) Codec DAI startup
	4) rtd startup

But here, 2) will call try_module_get() if component has
module_get_upon_open flags. This means 1) CPU DAI startup
will be operated *before* its module was loaded.
DAI should be called *after* Component.

Second, soc_pcm_close() operation order is
	1) CPU DAI shutdown
	2) Codec DAI shutdown
	3) rtd shutdown
	4) Component close

soc_pcm_open() and soc_pcm_close() are paired function,
but, its operation order is unbalance.
This patch tidyup soc_pcm_open() order to Component -> rtd -> DAI.
This is one of prepare for cleanup soc-pcm-open()
