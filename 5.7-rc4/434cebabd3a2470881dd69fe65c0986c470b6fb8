enetc: Add dynamic allocation of extended Rx BD rings

Hardware timestamping support (PTP) on Rx requires extended
buffer descriptors, double the size of normal Rx descriptors.
On the current controller revision only the timestamping offload
requires extended Rx descriptors.
Since Rx timestamping can be turned on/off at runtime, make Rx ring
allocation configurable at runtime too. As a result, the static
config option FSL_ENETC_HW_TIMESTAMPING can be dropped and the
extended descriptors can be used only when Rx timestamping gets
activated.
The extension has the same size as the base descriptor, making
the descriptor iterators easy to update for the extended case.
