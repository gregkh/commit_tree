KVM: X86: correct meaningless kvm_apicv_activated() check

After test_and_set_bit() for kvm->arch.apicv_inhibit_reasons, we will
always get false when calling kvm_apicv_activated() because it's sure
apicv_inhibit_reasons do not equal to 0.

What the code wants to do, is check whether APICv was *already* active
and if so skip the costly request; we can do this using cmpxchg.
