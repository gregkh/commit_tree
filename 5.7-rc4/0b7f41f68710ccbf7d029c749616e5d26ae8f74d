tcp-zerocopy: Update returned getsockopt() optlen.

TCP receive zerocopy currently does not update the returned optlen for
getsockopt() if the user passed in a larger than expected value.
Thus, userspace cannot properly determine if all the fields are set in
the passed-in struct. This patch sets the optlen for this case before
returning, in keeping with the expected operation of getsockopt().

Fixes: c8856c051454 ("tcp-zerocopy: Return inq along with tcp receive zerocopy.")
