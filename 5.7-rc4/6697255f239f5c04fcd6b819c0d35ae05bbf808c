dmaengine: tegra-apb: Improve DMA synchronization

Boot CPU0 always handles DMA interrupts and under some rare circumstances
it could stuck in uninterruptible state for a significant time (like in a
case of KASAN + NFS root). In this case sibling CPU, which waits for DMA
transfer completion, will get a DMA transfer timeout. In order to handle
this rare condition, interrupt status needs to be polled until interrupt
is handled.
