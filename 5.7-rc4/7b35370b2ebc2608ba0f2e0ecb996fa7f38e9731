PM: QoS: Clean up pm_qos_update_target() and pm_qos_update_flags()

Clean up the pm_qos_update_target() function:
 * Update its kerneldoc comment.
 * Drop the redundant ret local variable from it.
 * Reorder definitions of local variables in it.
 * Update a comment in it.

Also update the kerneldoc comment of pm_qos_update_flags() (e.g.
notifiers are not called by it any more) and add one emtpy line
to its body (for more visual clarity).

No intentional functional impact.
