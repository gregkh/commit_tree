powerpc/prom_init: Pass the "os-term" message to hypervisor

The "os-term" RTAS calls has one argument with a message address of OS
termination cause. rtas_os_term() already passes it but the recently
added prom_init's version of that missed it; it also does not fill
args correctly.

This passes the message address and initializes the number of arguments.
