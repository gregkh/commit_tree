ALSA: hda/realtek - Remove now-unnecessary XPS 13 headphone noise fixups

patch_realtek.c has historically failed to properly configure the PC
Beep Hidden Register for the ALC256 codec (among others). Depending on
your kernel version, symptoms of this misconfiguration can range from
chassis noise, picked up by a poorly-shielded PCBEEP trace, getting
amplified and played on your internal speaker and/or headphones to loud
feedback, which responds to the "Headphone Mic Boost" ALSA control,
getting played through your headphones. For details of the problem, see
the patch in this series titled "ALSA: hda/realtek - Set principled PC
Beep configuration for ALC256", which fixes the configuration.

These symptoms have been most noticed on the Dell XPS 13 9350 and 9360,
popular laptops that use the ALC256. As a result, several model-specific
fixups have been introduced to try and fix the problem, the most
egregious of which locks the "Headphone Mic Boost" control as a hack to
minimize noise from a feedback loop that shouldn't have been there in
the first place.

Now that the underlying issue has been fixed, remove all these fixups.
Remaining fixups needed by the XPS 13 are all picked up by existing pin
quirks.

This change should, for the XPS 13 9350/9360

 - Significantly increase volume and audio quality on headphones
 - Eliminate headphone popping on suspend/resume
 - Allow "Headphone Mic Boost" to be set again, making the headphone
   jack fully usable as a microphone jack too.
