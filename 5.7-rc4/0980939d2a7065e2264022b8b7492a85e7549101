drm/connector: Hookup the new drm_cmdline_mode panel_orientation member (v2)

If the new video=... panel_orientation option is set for a connector, honor
it and setup a matching "panel orientation" property on the connector.

Changes in v2:
-Improve DRM_INFO message to make it clear that the panel_orientation is
 being forced from the commandline
