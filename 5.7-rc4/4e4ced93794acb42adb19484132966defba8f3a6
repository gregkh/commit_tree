dax: Move mandatory ->zero_page_range() check in alloc_dax()

zero_page_range() dax operation is mandatory for dax devices. Right now
that check happens in dax_zero_page_range() function. Dan thinks that's
too late and its better to do the check earlier in alloc_dax().

I also modified alloc_dax() to return pointer with error code in it in
case of failure. Right now it returns NULL and caller assumes failure
happened due to -ENOMEM. But with this ->zero_page_range() check, I
need to return -EINVAL instead.
