ACPICA: acpiexec: remove redeclaration of acpi_gbl_db_opt_no_region_support

ACPICA commit 825c53661cacc7e3dab4844588201846143bd1b7

This variable was re-defined in a file specific to acpiexec. Remove
the redundant declaration and move the initialize to the debugger.

Patch based on suggestions by David Seifert and Benjamin Berg.
