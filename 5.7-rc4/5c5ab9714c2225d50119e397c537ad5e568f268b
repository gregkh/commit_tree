proc: speed up /proc/*/statm

top(1) reads all /proc/*/statm files but kernel threads will always have
zeros.  Print those zeroes directly without going through
seq_put_decimal_ull().

Speed up reading /proc/2/statm (which is kthreadd) is like 3%.

My system has more kernel threads than normal processes after booting KDE.
