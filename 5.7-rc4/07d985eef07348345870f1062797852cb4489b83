net: dsa: felix: Wire up the ocelot cls_flower methods

Export the cls_flower methods from the ocelot driver and hook them up to
the DSA passthrough layer.

Tables for the VCAP IS2 parameters, as well as half key packing (field
offsets and lengths) need to be defined for the VSC9959 core, as they
are different from Ocelot, mainly due to the different port count.
