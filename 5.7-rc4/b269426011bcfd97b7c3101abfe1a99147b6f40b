dmaengine: xilinx_dma: Add missing check for empty list

The DMA transfer might finish just after checking the state with
dma_cookie_status, but before the lock is acquired. Not checking
for an empty list in xilinx_dma_tx_status may result in reading
random data or data corruption when desc is written to. This can
be reliably triggered by using dma_sync_wait to wait for DMA
completion.
