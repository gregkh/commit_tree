drm/i915: Introduce encoder->compute_config_late()

Add an optional secondary encoder state compute hook. This gets
called after the normak .compute_config() has been called for
all the encoders in the state. Thus in the new hook we can rely
on all derived state populated by .compute_config() to be already
set up. Should be useful for MST and port sync master/slave
transcoder selection.
