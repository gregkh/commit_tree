spi: Allow SPI controller override device buswidth

Currently ACPI firmware description for a SPI device does not have any
method to describe the data buswidth on the board.

So even through the controller and device may support higher modes than
standard SPI, it cannot be assumed that the board does - as such, that
device is limited to standard SPI in such a circumstance.

As a workaround, allow the controller driver supply buswidth override bits,
which are used inform the core code that the controller driver knows the
buswidth supported on that board for that device.

A host controller driver might know this info from DMI tables, for example.
