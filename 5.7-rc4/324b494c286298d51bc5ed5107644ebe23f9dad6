nvme-pci: Remove two-pass completions

Completion handling had been done in two steps: find all new completions
under a lock, then handle those completions outside the lock. This was
done to make the locked section as short as possible so that other
threads using the same lock wait less time.

The driver no longer shares locks during completion, and is in fact
lockless for interrupt driven queues, so the optimization no longer
serves its original purpose. Replace the two-pass completion queue
handler with a single pass that completes entries immediately.
