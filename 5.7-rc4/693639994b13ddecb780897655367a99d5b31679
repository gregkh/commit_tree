xfs: remove xlog_state_want_sync

Open code the xlog_state_want_sync logic in its two callers given that
this function is a trivial wrapper around xlog_state_switch_iclogs.

Move the lockdep assert into xlog_state_switch_iclogs to not lose this
debugging aid, and improve the comment that documents
xlog_state_switch_iclogs as well.
