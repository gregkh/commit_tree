selftests/ftrace: Add test to test new set_event_notrace_pid file

A new file was added to the tracing directory that will allow a user to
place a PID into it and the task associated to that PID will not have its
events traced.  If the event-fork option is enabled, then neither will the
children of that task have its events traced.
