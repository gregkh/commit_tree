drm: Nerf drm_global_mutex BKL for good drivers

This catches the majority of drivers (unfortunately not if we take
users into account, because all the big drivers have at least a
lastclose hook).

With the prep patches out of the way all drm state is fully protected
and either prevents or can deal with the races from dropping the BKL
around open/close. The only thing left to audit are the various driver
hooks - by keeping the BKL around if any of them are set we have a
very simple cop-out!

Note that one of the biggest prep pieces to get here was making
dev->open_count atomic, which was done in
