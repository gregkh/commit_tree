mtd: spi-nor: Move SFDP logic out of the core

It makes the core file a bit smaller and provides better separation
between the SFDP parsing and core logic.

Keep the core.h and sfdp.h definitions private in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/.
Both expose just the definitions that are required by the core and
manufacturer drivers. None of the SPI NOR controller drivers should
include them.
