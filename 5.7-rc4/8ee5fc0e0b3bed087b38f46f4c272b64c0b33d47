mmc: sdhci_am654: Update OTAPDLY writes

According to the latest AM65x Data Manual[1], a different output tap
delay value is optimum for a given speed mode. Therefore, deprecate the
ti,otap-del-sel binding and introduce a new binding for each of the
possible MMC/SD speed modes. If the legacy mode is not found, fall back
to old binding to maintain dts compatibility.
