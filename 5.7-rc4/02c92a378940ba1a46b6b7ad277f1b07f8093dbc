PM: QoS: Redefine struct pm_qos_request and drop struct pm_qos_object

First, change the definition of struct pm_qos_request so that it
contains a struct pm_qos_constraints pointer (called "qos") instead
of a PM QoS class number (in preparation for dropping the PM QoS
classes concept altogether going forward) and move its definition
(along with the definition of struct pm_qos_flags_request that does
not change) after the definition of struct pm_qos_constraints.

Next, drop the definition of struct pm_qos_object and the null_pm_qos
and cpu_dma_pm_qos variables of that type along with pm_qos_array[]
holding pointers to them and change the code to refer to the
pm_qos_constraints structure directly or to use the new qos pointer
in struct pm_qos_request for that instead of going through
pm_qos_array[] to access it.  Also update kerneldoc comments that
mention pm_qos_class to refer to PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY directly
instead.

Finally, drop register_pm_qos_misc(), introduce cpu_latency_qos_miscdev
(with the name field set to "cpu_dma_latency") to implement the
CPU latency QoS interface in /dev/ and register it directly from
pm_qos_power_init().

After these changes the notion of PM QoS classes remains only in the
API (in the form of redundant function parameters that are ignored)
and in the definitions of PM QoS trace events.

While at it, some redundant local variables are dropped etc.

No intentional functional impact.
