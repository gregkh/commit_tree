audit: trigger accompanying records when no rules present

When there are no audit rules registered, mandatory records (config,
etc.) are missing their accompanying records (syscall, proctitle, etc.).

This is due to audit context dummy set on syscall entry based on absence
of rules that signals that no other records are to be printed.

Clear the dummy bit if any record is generated.

The proctitle context and dummy checks are pointless since the
proctitle record will not be printed if no syscall records are printed.
