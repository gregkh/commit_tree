x86/kexec: Use RIP relative addressing

Normally identity_mapped is not visible to objtool, due to:

  arch/x86/kernel/Makefile:OBJECT_FILES_NON_STANDARD_relocate_kernel_$(BITS).o := y

However, when we want to run objtool on vmlinux.o there is no hiding
it:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: .text+0x4c0f1: unsupported intra-function call

Replace the (i386 inspired) pattern:

	call 1f
  1:	popq %r8
	subq $(1b - relocate_kernel), %r8

With a x86_64 RIP-relative LEA:

	leaq relocate_kernel(%rip), %r8
