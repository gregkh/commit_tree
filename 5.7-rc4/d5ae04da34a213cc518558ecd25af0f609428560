bpftool: Translate prog_id to its bpf prog_name

The kernel struct_ops obj has kernel's func ptrs implemented by bpf_progs.
The bpf prog_id is stored as the value of the func ptr for introspection
purpose.  In the latter patch, a struct_ops dump subcmd will be added
to introspect these func ptrs.  It is desired to print the actual bpf
prog_name instead of only printing the prog_id.

Since struct_ops is the only usecase storing prog_id in the func ptr,
this patch adds a prog_id_as_func_ptr bool (default is false) to
"struct btf_dumper" in order not to mis-interpret the ptr value
for the other existing use-cases.

While printing a func_ptr as a bpf prog_name,
this patch also prefix the bpf prog_name with the ptr's func_proto.
[ Note that it is the ptr's func_proto instead of the bpf prog's
  func_proto ]
It reuses the current btf_dump_func() to obtain the ptr's func_proto
string.

Here is an example from the bpf_cubic.c:
"void (struct sock *, u32, u32) bictcp_cong_avoid/prog_id:140"
