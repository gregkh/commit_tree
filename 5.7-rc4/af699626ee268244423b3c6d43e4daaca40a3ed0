net: sched: Support specifying a starting chain via tc skb ext

Set the starting chain from the tc skb ext chain value. Once we read
the tc skb ext, delete it, so cloned/redirect packets won't inherit it.

In order to lookup a chain by the chain index on the ingress block
at ingress classification, provide a lookup function.
