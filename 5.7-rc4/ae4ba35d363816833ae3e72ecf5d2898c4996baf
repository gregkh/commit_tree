usb: typec: Allow power role swapping even without USB PD

Even though originally the USB Type-C Specification did not
describe the steps for power role swapping without USB PD
contract in place, it did not actually mean power role swap
without USB PD was not allowed. The USB Type-C Specification
did not clearly separate the data and power roles until in
the release 1.2 which is why there also were no clear steps
for the scenario where only the power role was swapped
without USB PD contract before that.

Since in the latest version of the specification the power
role swap without USB PD is now clearly mentioned as allowed
operation, removing the check that prevented power role swap
without USB PD support.
