net/mlx5: E-Switch, Introduce per vport configuration for eswitch modes

Both legacy and offload modes require vport setup, only offload mode
requires rep setup. Before this patch, vport and rep operations are
separated applied to all relevant vports in different stages.

Change to use per vport configuration, so that vport and rep operations
are modularized per vport.
