KVM: x86/mmu: Merge kvm_{enable,disable}_tdp() into a common function

Combine kvm_enable_tdp() and kvm_disable_tdp() into a single function,
kvm_configure_mmu(), in preparation for doing additional configuration
during hardware setup.  And because having separate helpers is silly.

No functional change intended.
