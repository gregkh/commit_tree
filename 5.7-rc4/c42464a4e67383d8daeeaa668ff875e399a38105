ASoC: topology: Perform component check upfront

Function soc_tplg_dbytes_create(), calls soc_tplg_init_kcontrol() to
perform additional driver specific initialization. While
soc_tplg_init_kcontrol() ensures that component is valid before invoking
ops->control_load, there is no such check at the end of
soc_tplg_dbytes_create() where list_add() is used.

Also in quite a few places, there is reference of tplg->comp->dapm or
tplg->comp->card, without any checks for tplg->comp.

In consequence of the above this may lead to referencing NULL pointer.

This allows for removal of now unnecessary checks.
