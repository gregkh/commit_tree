KVM: s390: protvirt: disallow one_reg

A lot of the registers are controlled by the Ultravisor and never
visible to KVM. Some fields in the sie control block are overlayed, like
gbea. As no known userspace uses the ONE_REG interface on s390 if sync
regs are available, no functionality is lost if it is disabled for
protected guests.
