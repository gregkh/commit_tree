KVM: x86: Fix warning due to implicit truncation on 32-bit KVM

Explicitly cast the integer literal to an unsigned long when stuffing a
non-canonical value into the host virtual address during private memslot
deletion.  The explicit cast fixes a warning that gets promoted to an
error when running with KVM's newfangled -Werror setting.

  to unsigned type [-Werror=overflow]
