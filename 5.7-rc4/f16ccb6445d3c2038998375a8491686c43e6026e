drm/i915: Disable use of hwsp_cacheline for kernel_context

Currently on execlists, we use a local hwsp for the kernel_context,
rather than the engine's HWSP, as this is the default for execlists.
However, seqno wrap requires allocating a new HWSP cacheline, and may
require pinning a new HWSP page in the GGTT. This operation requiring
pinning in the GGTT is not allowed within the kernel_context timeline,
as doing so may require re-entering the kernel_context in order to evict
from the GGTT. As we want to avoid requiring a new HWSP for the
kernel_context, we can use the permanently pinned engine's HWSP instead.
However to do so we must prevent the use of semaphores reading the
kernel_context's HWSP, as the use of semaphores do not support rollover
onto the same cacheline. Fortunately, the kernel_context is mostly
isolated, so unlikely to give benefit to semaphores.
