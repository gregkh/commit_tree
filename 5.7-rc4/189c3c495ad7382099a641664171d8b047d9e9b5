iio: position: Add support for Azoteq IQS624/625 angle sensors

This patch adds support for the Azoteq IQS624 and IQS625 angular position
sensors, capable of reporting the angle of a rotating shaft down to 1 and
10 degrees of accuracy, respectively.

This patch also introduces a home for linear and angular position sensors.
Unlike resolvers, they are typically contactless and use the Hall effect.
