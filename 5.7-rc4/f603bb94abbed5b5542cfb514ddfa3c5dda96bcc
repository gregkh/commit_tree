btrfs: Perform pinned cleanup directly in btrfs_destroy_delayed_refs

Having btrfs_destroy_delayed_refs call btrfs_pin_extent is problematic
for making pinned extents tracking per-transaction since
btrfs_trans_handle cannot be passed to btrfs_pin_extent in this context.
Additionally delayed refs heads pinned in btrfs_destroy_delayed_refs
are going to be handled very closely, in btrfs_destroy_pinned_extent.

To enable btrfs_pin_extent to take btrfs_trans_handle simply open code
it in btrfs_destroy_delayed_refs and call btrfs_error_unpin_extent_range
on the range. This enables us to do less work in
btrfs_destroy_pinned_extent and leaves btrfs_pin_extent being called in
contexts which have a valid btrfs_trans_handle.
