selftests: bpf: Add test for sk_assign

Attach a tc direct-action classifier to lo in a fresh network
namespace, and rewrite all connection attempts to localhost:4321
to localhost:1234 (for port tests) and connections to unreachable
IPv4/IPv6 IPs to the local socket (for address tests). Includes
implementations for both TCP and UDP.

Keep in mind that both client to server and server to client traffic
passes the classifier.
