staging: vt6656: Fix calling conditions of vnt_set_bss_mode

vnt_set_bss_mode needs to be called on all changes to BSS_CHANGED_BASIC_RATES,
BSS_CHANGED_ERP_PREAMBLE and BSS_CHANGED_ERP_SLOT

Remove all other calls and vnt_update_ifs which is called in vnt_set_bss_mode.

Fixes an issue that preamble mode is not being updated correctly.

Fixes: c12603576e06 ("staging: vt6656: Only call vnt_set_bss_mode on basic rates change.")
