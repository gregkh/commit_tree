s390/cio: avoid duplicated 'ADD' uevents

The common I/O layer delays the ADD uevent for subchannels and
delegates generating this uevent to the individual subchannel
drivers. The io_subchannel driver will do so when the associated
ccw_device has been registered -- but unconditionally, so more
ADD uevents will be generated if a subchannel has been unbound
from the io_subchannel driver and later rebound.

To fix this, only generate the ADD event if uevents were still
suppressed for the device.
