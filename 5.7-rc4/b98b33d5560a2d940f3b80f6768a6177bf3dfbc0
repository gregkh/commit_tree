iwlwifi: pcie: actually release queue memory in TVQM

The iwl_trans_pcie_dyn_txq_free() function only releases the frames
that may be left on the queue by calling iwl_pcie_gen2_txq_unmap(),
but doesn't actually free the DMA ring or byte-count tables for the
queue. This leads to pretty large memory leaks (at least before my
queue size improvements), in particular in monitor/sniffer mode on
channel hopping since this happens on every channel change.

This was also now more evident after the move to a DMA pool for the
byte count tables, showing messages such as

  BUG iwlwifi:bc (...): Objects remaining in iwlwifi:bc on __kmem_cache_shutdown()
