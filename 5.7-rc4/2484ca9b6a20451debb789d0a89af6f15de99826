mm: Introduce vma_is_special_huge

For VM_PFNMAP and VM_MIXEDMAP vmas that want to support transhuge pages
and -page table entries, introduce vma_is_special_huge() that takes the
same codepaths as vma_is_dax().

The use of "special" follows the definition in memory.c, vm_normal_page():
"Special" mappings do not wish to be associated with a "struct page"
(either it doesn't exist, or it exists but they don't want to touch it)

For PAGE_SIZE pages, "special" is determined per page table entry to be
able to deal with COW pages. But since we don't have huge COW pages,
we can classify a vma as either "special huge" or "normal huge".
