selftests/bpf: Fix nanosleep for real this time

Amazingly, some libc implementations don't call __NR_nanosleep syscall from
their nanosleep() APIs. Hammer it down with explicit syscall() call and never
get back to it again. Also simplify code for timespec initialization.

I verified that nanosleep is called w/ printk and in exactly same Linux image
that is used in Travis CI. So it should both sleep and call correct syscall.

v1->v2:
  - math is too hard, fix usec -> nsec convertion (Martin);
  - test_vmlinux has explicit nanosleep() call, convert that one as well.
