MAINTAINERS: adjust to reservation.h renaming

Commit 52791eeec1d9 ("dma-buf: rename reservation_object to dma_resv")
renamed include/linux/reservation.h to include/linux/dma-resv.h, but
missed the reference in the MAINTAINERS entry.

Since then, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test complains:

  warning: no file matches F: include/linux/reservation.h

Adjust the DMA BUFFER SHARING FRAMEWORK entry in MAINTAINERS.
