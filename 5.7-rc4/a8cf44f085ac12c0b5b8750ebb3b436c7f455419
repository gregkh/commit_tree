ALSA: hda: Remove ASUS ROG Zenith from the blacklist

The commit 3c6fd1f07ed0 ("ALSA: hda: Add driver blacklist") added a
new blacklist for the devices that are known to have empty codecs, and
one of the entries was ASUS ROG Zenith II (PCI SSID 1043:874f).
However, it turned out that the very same PCI SSID is used for the
previous model that does have the valid HD-audio codecs and the change
broke the sound on it.

This patch reverts the corresponding entry as a temporary solution.
Although Zenith II and co will see get the empty HD-audio bus again,
it'd be merely resource wastes and won't affect the functionality,
so it's no end of the world.  We'll need to address this later,
e.g. by either switching to DMI string matching or using PCI ID &
SSID pairs.
