vhost: refine vhost and vringh kconfig

Currently, CONFIG_VHOST depends on CONFIG_VIRTUALIZATION. But vhost is
not necessarily for VM since it's a generic userspace and kernel
communication protocol. Such dependency may prevent archs without
virtualization support from using vhost.

To solve this, a dedicated vhost menu is created under drivers so
CONIFG_VHOST can be decoupled out of CONFIG_VIRTUALIZATION.

While at it, also squash Kconfig.vringh into vhost Kconfig file. This
avoids the trick of conditional inclusion from VOP or CAIF. Then it
will be easier to introduce new vringh users and common dependency for
both vringh and vhost.
