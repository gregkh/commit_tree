common: Introduce processor.h

The vDSO library should only include the necessary headers required for
a userspace library (UAPI and a minimal set of kernel headers). To make
this possible it is necessary to isolate from the kernel headers the
common parts that are strictly necessary to build the library.

Introduce processor.h to contain all the processor specific functions
that are suitable for vDSO inclusion.
