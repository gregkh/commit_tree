PM: sleep: core: Drop racy and redundant checks from device_prepare()

Alan Stern points out that the WARN_ON() check in device_prepare()
is racy (because the PM-runtime API can be disabled briefly for any
device at any time and system suspend can start at any time too) and
the pm_runtime_suspended() check in the computation of the
direct_complete flag value is redundant (because it will be
repeated later anyway).

Drop both these checks accordingly.
