staging: mt7621-pci: avoid to set 'iomem_resource' addresses

Setting up kernel resource 'iomem_resource' for PCI with
addresses parsed from device tree gots into a conflict within
the usb xhci driver:

xhci-mtk 1e1c0000.xhci: can't request region for resource [mem 0x1e1c0000-0x1e1c0fff]
xhci-mtk: probe of 1e1c0000.xhci failed with error -16

Don't assign it and maintain the default addresses for this
resource seems to fix the problem. Checking legacy driver it
is being only  setting the 'ioport_resource'.
