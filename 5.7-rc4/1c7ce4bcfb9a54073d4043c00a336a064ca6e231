scsi: ch: synchronize ch_probe() and ch_open()

The 'ch' device node is created before the configuration is being read in,
which leads to a race window when ch_open() is called before that.

To avoid any races we should be taking the device mutex during
ch_readconfig() and ch_init_elem(), and also during ch_open().
That ensures ch_probe is finished before ch_open() completes.
