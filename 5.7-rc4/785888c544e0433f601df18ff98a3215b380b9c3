ring-buffer: Have rb_iter_head_event() handle concurrent writer

Have the ring_buffer_iter structure have a place to store an event, such
that it can not be overwritten by a writer, and load it in such a way via
rb_iter_head_event() that it will return NULL and reset the iter to the
start of the current page if a writer updated the page.
