drm/tidss: fix crash related to accessing freed memory

tidss uses devm_kzalloc to allocate DRM plane, encoder and crtc objects.
This is not correct as the lifetime of those objects should be longer
than the underlying device's.

When unloading tidss module, the devm_kzalloc'ed objects have already
been freed when tidss_release() is called, and the driver will accesses
freed memory possibly causing a crash, a kernel WARN, or other undefined
behavior, and also KASAN will give a bug.
