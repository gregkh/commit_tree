btrfs: hold a ref on the root in btrfs_search_path_in_tree_user

We can wander into a different root, so grab a ref on the root we look
up.  Later on we make root = fs_info->tree_root so we need this separate
out label to make sure we do the right cleanup only in the case we're
looking up a different root.
