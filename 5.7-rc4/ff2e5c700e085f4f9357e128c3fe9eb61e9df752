ice: add basic handler for devlink .info_get

The devlink .info_get callback allows the driver to report detailed
version information. The following devlink versions are reported with
this initial implementation:

 "fw.mgmt" -> The version of the firmware that controls PHY, link, etc
 "fw.mgmt.api" -> API version of interface exposed over the AdminQ
 "fw.mgmt.build" -> Unique build id of the source for the management fw
 "fw.undi" -> Version of the Option ROM containing the UEFI driver
 "fw.psid.api" -> Version of the NVM image format.
 "fw.bundle_id" -> Unique identifier for the combined flash image.
 "fw.app.name" -> The name of the active DDP package.
 "fw.app" -> The version of the active DDP package.

With this, devlink dev info can report at least as much information as
is reported by ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO.

Compare the output from ethtool vs from devlink:

  $ ethtool -i ens785s0
  driver: ice
  version: 0.8.1-k
  firmware-version: 0.80 0x80002ec0 1.2581.0
  expansion-rom-version:
  bus-info: 0000:3b:00.0
  supports-statistics: yes
  supports-test: yes
  supports-eeprom-access: yes
  supports-register-dump: yes
  supports-priv-flags: yes

  $ devlink dev info pci/0000:3b:00.0
  pci/0000:3b:00.0:
  driver ice
  serial number 00-01-ab-ff-ff-ca-05-68
  versions:
      running:
        fw.mgmt 2.1.7
        fw.mgmt.api 1.5
        fw.mgmt.build 0x305d955f
        fw.undi 1.2581.0
        fw.psid.api 0.80
        fw.bundle_id 0x80002ec0
        fw.app.name ICE OS Default Package
        fw.app 1.3.1.0

More pieces of information can be displayed, each version is kept
separate instead of munged together, and each version has an identifier
which comes with associated documentation.
