Revert "nl80211: add src and dst addr attributes for control port tx/rx"

This reverts commit 8c3ed7aa2b9ef666195b789e9b02e28383243fa8.

As Jouni points out, there's really no need for this, since the
RSN pre-authentication frames are normal data frames, not port
control frames (locally).

We can still revert this now since it hasn't actually gone beyond
-next.
