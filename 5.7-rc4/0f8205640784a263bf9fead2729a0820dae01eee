i2c: stm32f7: add a new st, stm32mp15-i2c compatible

Add a new stm32mp15 specific compatible to handle FastMode+
registers handling which is different on the stm32mp15 compared
to the stm32f7 or stm32h7.
Indeed, on the stm32mp15, the FastMode+ set and clear registers
are separated while on the other platforms (F7 or H7) the control
is done in a unique register.
