io_uring: fix ctx refcounting in io_submit_sqes()

If io_get_req() fails, it drops a ref. Then, awhile keeping @submitted
unmodified, io_submit_sqes() breaks the loop and puts @nr - @submitted
refs. For each submitted req a ref is dropped in io_put_req() and
friends. So, for @nr taken refs there will be
(@nr - @submitted + @submitted + 1) dropped.

Remove ctx refcounting from io_get_req(), that at the same time makes
it clearer.
