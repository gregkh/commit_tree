clk: sprd: Add macros for referencing parents without strings

With the new clk parenting code, clk_init_data was expanded to include
.parent_hws and .parent_data, for clk drivers to specify parents without
name strings of clocks.

Also some macros were added for using these two items to reference
clock parents. Based on that to expand macros for sprd clocks:

- SPRD_*_DATA, take an array of struct clk_parent_data * as its parents
  which should be a combination of .fw_name (devicetree clock-names),
  .hw (pointers to a local struct clk_hw).

- SPRD_*_HW, take a local struct clk_hw pointer, instead of a string, as
  its parent.

- SPRD_*_FW_NAME, take a string of clock-names decleared in the device
  tree as the clock parent.
