perf metricgroup: Support metric constraint

Some metric groups have metric constraints. A metric group can be
scheduled as a group only when some constraints are applied.  For
example, Page_Walks_Utilization has a metric constraint,
"NO_NMI_WATCHDOG".

When NMI watchdog is disabled, the metric group can be scheduled as a
group. Otherwise, splitting the metric group into standalone metrics.

Add a new function, metricgroup__has_constraint(), to check whether all
constraints are applied. If not, splitting the metric group into
standalone metrics.

Currently, only one constraint, "NO_NMI_WATCHDOG", is checked. Print a
warning for the metric group with the constraint, when NMI WATCHDOG is
enabled.
