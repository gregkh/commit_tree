iio: dac: ad5770r: fix off-by-one check on maximum number of channels

Currently there is an off-by-one check on the number of channels that
will cause an arry overrun in array st->output_mode when calling the
function d5770r_store_output_range. Fix this by using >= rather than >
to check for maximum number of channels.
