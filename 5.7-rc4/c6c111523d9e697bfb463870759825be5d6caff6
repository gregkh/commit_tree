selftests/bpf: Check for correct program attach/detach in xdp_attach test

David Ahern noticed that there was a bug in the EXPECTED_FD code so
programs did not get detached properly when that parameter was supplied.
This case was not included in the xdp_attach tests; so let's add it to be
sure that such a bug does not sneak back in down.
