KVM: s390: protvirt: Only sync fmt4 registers

A lot of the registers are controlled by the Ultravisor and never
visible to KVM. Also some registers are overlayed, like gbea is with
sidad, which might leak data to userspace.

Hence we sync a minimal set of registers for both SIE formats and then
check and sync format 2 registers if necessary.
