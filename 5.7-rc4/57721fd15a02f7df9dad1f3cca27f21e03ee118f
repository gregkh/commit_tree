rcu: Remove dead code from rcu_segcblist_insert_pend_cbs()

The rcu_segcblist_insert_pend_cbs() function currently (partially)
initializes the rcu_cblist that it pulls callbacks from.  However, all
the resulting stores are dead because all callers pass in the address of
an on-stack cblist that is not used afterwards.  This commit therefore
removes this pointless initialization.
