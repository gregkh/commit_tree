powerpc: Add back __ARCH_WANT_SYS_LLSEEK macro

This partially reverts commit caf6f9c8a326 ("asm-generic: Remove
unneeded __ARCH_WANT_SYS_LLSEEK macro")

When CONFIG_COMPAT is disabled on ppc64 the kernel does not build.

There is resistance to both removing the llseek syscall from the 64bit
syscall tables and building the llseek interface unconditionally.
