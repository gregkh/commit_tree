perf block-info: Allow selecting which columns to report and its order

Currently we use a predefined array to set the block info output
formats, it's fixed and inflexible.

This patch adds two parameters "block_hpps" and "nr_hpps" in
block_info__create_report and other static functions, in order to let
user decide which columns to report and with specified report ordering.
It should be more flexible.

Buffers will be allocated to contain the new fmts, of course, we need to
release them before perf exits.
