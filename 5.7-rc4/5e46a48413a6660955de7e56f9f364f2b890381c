irqchip/gic-v4.1: Map the ITS SGIR register page

One of the new features of GICv4.1 is to allow virtual SGIs to be
directly signaled to a VPE. For that, the ITS has grown a new
64kB page containing only a single register that is used to
signal a SGI to a given VPE.

Add a second mapping covering this new 64kB range, and take this
opportunity to limit the original mapping to 64kB, which is enough
to cover the span of the ITS registers.
