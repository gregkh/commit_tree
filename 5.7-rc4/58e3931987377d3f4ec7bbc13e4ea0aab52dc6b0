io-wq: optimise locking in io_worker_handle_work()

There are 2 optimisations:
- Now, io_worker_handler_work() do io_assign_current_work() twice per
request, and each one adds lock/unlock(worker->lock) pair. The first is
to reset worker->cur_work to NULL, and the second to set a real work
shortly after. If there is a dependant work, set it immediately, that
effectively removes the extra NULL'ing.

- And there is no use in taking wqe->lock for linked works, as they are
not hashed now. Optimise it out.
