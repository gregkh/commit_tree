drm/amd/display: Allocate scratch space for DMUB CW7

[Why]
The scratch space can be used to pass data between x86 and DMCUB.  DMCUB
will manage the actually mapping of CW7 internally, driver does not
program the window.

[How]
Allocate extra space within the DMUB service's framebuffer for this
scratch space and expose them from the service for use in DC.
