Revert "tty: serial: samsung_tty: build it for any platform"

This reverts commit 175b558d0efb8b4f33aa7bd2c1b5389b912d3019.

When the user configures a kernel without support for Samsung SoCs, it
makes no sense to ask the user about enabling "Samsung SoC serial
support", as Samsung serial ports can only be found on Samsung SoCs.
