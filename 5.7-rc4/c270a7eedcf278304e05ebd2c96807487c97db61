mm: introduce FAULT_FLAG_INTERRUPTIBLE

handle_userfaultfd() is currently the only one place in the kernel page
fault procedures that can respond to non-fatal userspace signals.  It was
trying to detect such an allowance by checking against USER & KILLABLE
flags, which was "un-official".

In this patch, we introduced a new flag (FAULT_FLAG_INTERRUPTIBLE) to show
that the fault handler allows the fault procedure to respond even to
non-fatal signals.  Meanwhile, add this new flag to the default fault
flags so that all the page fault handlers can benefit from the new flag.
With that, replacing the userfault check to this one.

Since the line is getting even longer, clean up the fault flags a bit too
to ease TTY users.

Although we've got a new flag and applied it, we shouldn't have any
functional change with this patch so far.
