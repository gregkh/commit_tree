nvme: Don't deter users from enabling hwmon support

I see no good reason for the "If unsure, say N" advice in the description
of the NVME_HWMON configuration option. It is not dangerous, it does
not select any other option, and has a fairly low overhead.

As the option is already not enabled by default, further suggesting
hesitant users to not enable it is not useful anyway. Unlike some other
options where the description alone may not be sufficient for users to
make a decision, NVME_HWMON is pretty simple to grasp in my opinion,
so just let the user do what they want.
