usb: gadget: aspeed: read vhub properties from device tree

The patch introduces 2 DT properties ("aspeed,vhub-downstream-ports" and
"aspeed,vhub-generic-endpoints") which replaces hardcoded port/endpoint
number. It is to make it more convenient to add support for newer vhub
revisions with different number of ports and endpoints.
