net/mlx5e: Support dump callback in RX reporter

Add support for SQ's FW dump on RX reporter's events. Use Resource dump
API to retrieve the relevant data: RX slice, RQ dump, RX buffer and
ICOSQ dump (depends on the error). Wrap it in formatted messages and
store the binary output in devlink core.

Example:
$ devlink health dump show pci/0000:00:0b.0 reporter rx
