ipv6: rpl: fix loop iteration

This patch fix the loop iteration by not walking over the last
iteration. The cmpri compressing value exempt the last segment. As the
code shows the last iteration will be overwritten by cmpre value
handling which is for the last segment.

I think this doesn't end in any bufferoverflows because we work on worst
case temporary buffer sizes but it ends in not best compression settings
in some cases.
