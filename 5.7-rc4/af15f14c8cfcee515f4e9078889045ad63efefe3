selinux: free str on error in str_read()

In [see "Fixes:"] I missed the fact that str_read() may give back an
allocated pointer even if it returns an error, causing a potential
memory leak in filename_trans_read_one(). Fix this by making the
function free the allocated string whenever it returns a non-zero value,
which also makes its behavior more obvious and prevents repeating the
same mistake in the future.
