arm64: tegra: Add clock-cells property to Tegra PMC node

Tegra132 and Tegra210 PMC blocks have clk_out_1, clk_out_2, clk_out_3,
and a blink clock as a part of the PMC.

These clocks were erroneously provided by the clock and reset controller
and are now provided by the PMC instead because that's where the primary
controls are.

Clock IDs for these clocks are defined in the PMC dt-bindings.

This patch updates the device tree to include the PMC dt-bindings header
and adds the #clock-cells property with one clock specifier to the PMC
node.
