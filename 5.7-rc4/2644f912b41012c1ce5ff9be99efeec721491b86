backlight: pwm_bl: Switch to full GPIO descriptor

The PWM backlight still supports passing a enable GPIO line as
platform data using the legacy <linux/gpio.h> API.

It turns out that ever board using this mechanism except one
is pass .enable_gpio = -1. So we drop all these cargo-culted -1's
from all instances of this platform data in the kernel.

The remaning board, Palm TC, is converted to pass a machine
descriptior table with the "enable" GPIO instead, and delete the
platform data entry for enable_gpio and the code handling it
and things should work smoothly with the new API.
