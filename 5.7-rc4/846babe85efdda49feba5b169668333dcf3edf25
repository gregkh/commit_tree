mm/hmm: do not unconditionally set pfns when returning EBUSY

In hmm_vma_handle_pte() and hmm_vma_walk_hugetlb_entry() if fault happens
then -EBUSY will be returned and the pfns input flags will have been
destroyed.

For hmm_vma_handle_pte() set HMM_PFN_NONE only on the success returns that
don't otherwise store to pfns.

For hmm_vma_walk_hugetlb_entry() all exit paths already set pfns, so
remove the redundant store.
