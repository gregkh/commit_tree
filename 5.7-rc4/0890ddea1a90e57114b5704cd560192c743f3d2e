KVM: s390: protvirt: Add SCLP interrupt handling

The sclp interrupt is kind of special. The ultravisor polices that we
do not inject an sclp interrupt with payload if no sccb is outstanding.
On the other hand we have "asynchronous" event interrupts, e.g. for
console input.
We separate both variants into sclp interrupt and sclp event interrupt.
The sclp interrupt is masked until a previous servc instruction has
finished (sie exit 108).
