net: stmmac: Enable SERDES power up/down sequence

This patch is to enable Intel SERDES power up/down sequence. The SERDES
converts 8/10 bits data to SGMII signal. Below is an example of
HW configuration for SGMII mode. The SERDES is located in the PHY IF
in the diagram below.

<-----------------GBE Controller---------->|<--External PHY chip-->
+----------+         +----+            +---+           +----------+
|   EQoS   | <-GMII->| DW | < ------ > |PHY| <-SGMII-> | External |
|   MAC    |         |xPCS|            |IF |           | PHY      |
+----------+         +----+            +---+           +----------+
       ^               ^                 ^                ^
       |               |                 |                |
       +---------------------MDIO-------------------------+

PHY IF configuration and status registers are accessible through
mdio address 0x15 which is defined as mdio_adhoc_addr. During D0,
The driver will need to power up PHY IF by changing the power state
to P0. Likewise, for D3, the driver sets PHY IF power state to P3.
