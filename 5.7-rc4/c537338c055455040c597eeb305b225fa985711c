fs_parse: remove pr_notice() about each validation

This notice fills my boot logs with scary-looking asterisks but doesn't
really tell me anything.  Let's just remove it; validation errors are
already reported separately, so this is just a redundant list of
filesystems.

$ dmesg | grep VALIDATE
[    0.306256] *** VALIDATE tmpfs ***
[    0.307422] *** VALIDATE proc ***
[    0.308355] *** VALIDATE cgroup ***
[    0.308741] *** VALIDATE cgroup2 ***
[    0.813256] *** VALIDATE bpf ***
[    0.815272] *** VALIDATE ramfs ***
[    0.815665] *** VALIDATE hugetlbfs ***
[    0.876970] *** VALIDATE nfs ***
[    0.877383] *** VALIDATE nfs4 ***
