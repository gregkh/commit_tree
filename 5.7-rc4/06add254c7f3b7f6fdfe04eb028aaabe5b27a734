KVM: x86: Shrink the usercopy region of the emulation context

Shuffle a few operand structs to the end of struct x86_emulate_ctxt and
update the cache creation to whitelist only the region of the emulation
context that is expected to be copied to/from user memory, e.g. the
instruction operands, registers, and fetch/io/mem caches.
