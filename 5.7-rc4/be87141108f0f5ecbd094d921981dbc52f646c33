selftests/vm: run_vmtests: invoke gup_benchmark with basic FOLL_PIN coverage

It's good to have basic unit test coverage of the new FOLL_PIN behavior.
Fortunately, the gup_benchmark unit test is extremely fast (a few
milliseconds), so adding it the the run_vmtests suite is going to cause no
noticeable change in running time.

So, add two new invocations to run_vmtests:

1) Run gup_benchmark with normal get_user_pages().

2) Run gup_benchmark with pin_user_pages().  This is much like the
   first call, except that it sets FOLL_PIN.

Running these two in quick succession also provide a visual comparison of
the running times, which is convenient.

The new invocations are fairly early in the run_vmtests script, because
with test suites, it's usually preferable to put the shorter, faster tests
first, all other things being equal.
