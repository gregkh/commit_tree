ARM: dts: pxa*: Make the serial ports compatible with xscale-uart

Some drivers that claim to support mrvl,mmp-uart default to a reg-shift
of two, some don't. Be explicit to be on a safe side.

With that in place, a XScale serial port driver is perfectly capable of
supporting the MMP serial port. Add a compatible string.
