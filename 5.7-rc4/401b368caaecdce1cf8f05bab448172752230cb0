ARM: decompressor: switch to by-VA cache maintenance for v7 cores

Update the v7 cache_clean_flush routine to take into account the
memory range passed in r0/r1, and perform cache maintenance by
virtual address on this range instead of set/way maintenance, which
is inappropriate for the purpose of maintaining the cached state of
memory contents.

Since this removes any use of the stack in the implementation of
cache_clean_flush(), we can also drop some code that manages the
value of the stack pointer before calling it.
