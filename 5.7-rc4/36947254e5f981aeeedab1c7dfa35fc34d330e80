KVM: Dynamically size memslot array based on number of used slots

Now that the memslot logic doesn't assume memslots are always non-NULL,
dynamically size the array of memslots instead of unconditionally
allocating memory for the maximum number of memslots.

Note, because a to-be-deleted memslot must first be invalidated, the
array size cannot be immediately reduced when deleting a memslot.
However, consecutive deletions will realize the memory savings, i.e.
a second deletion will trim the entry.
