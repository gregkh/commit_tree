octeontx2-af: Optimize data retrieval from firmware

For retrieving info like interface MAC addresses, packet
parser key extraction config etc currently a command
is sent to firmware and firmware which periodically polls
for commands, processes these and returns the info.

This is resulting in interface initialization taking lot
of time. To optimize this a memory region is shared between
firmware and this driver, firmware while booting puts
static info like these into that region for driver to
read directly without using commands.

With this
- Logic for retrieving packet parser extraction config
  via commands is removed and repalced with using the
  shared 'fwdata' structure.
- Now RVU MSIX vector address is also retrieved from this fwdata struct
  instead of from CSR. Otherwise when kexec/kdump crash kernel loads
  CSR will have a IOVA setup by primary kernel which impacts
  RVU PF/VF's interrupts.
- Also added a mbox handler for PF/VF interfaces to retrieve their MAC
  addresses from AF.
