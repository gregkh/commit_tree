powerpc/powernv: Re-enable imc trace-mode in kernel

commit <249fad734a25> ""powerpc/perf: Disable trace_imc pmu"
disables IMC(In-Memory Collection) trace-mode in kernel, since frequent
mode switching between accumulation mode and trace mode via the spr LDBAR
in the hardware can trigger a checkstop(system crash).

Patch to re-enable imc-trace mode in kernel.

The previous patch(1/2) in this series will address the mode switching issue
by implementing a global lock, and will restrict the usage of
accumulation and trace-mode at a time.
