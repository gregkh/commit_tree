bpf/stackmap: Dont trylock mmap_sem with PREEMPT_RT and interrupts disabled

In a RT kernel down_read_trylock() cannot be used from NMI context and
up_read_non_owner() is another problematic issue.

So in such a configuration, simply elide the annotated stackmap and
just report the raw IPs.

In the longer term, it might be possible to provide a atomic friendly
versions of the page cache traversal which will at least provide the info
if the pages are resident and don't need to be paged in.

[ tglx: Use IS_ENABLED() to avoid the #ifdeffery, fixup the irq work
  	callback and add a comment ]
