tools/build: tweak unused value workaround

Clang has -Wself-assign enabled by default under -Wall, which always
gets -Werror'ed on this file, causing sync-compare-and-swap to be
disabled by default.

The generally-accepted way to spell "this value is intentionally
unused," is casting it to `void`.  This is accepted by both GCC and
Clang with -Wall enabled: https://godbolt.org/z/qqZ9r3
