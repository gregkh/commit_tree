ethtool: set device ring sizes with RINGS_SET request

Implement RINGS_SET netlink request to set ring sizes of a network device.
These are traditionally set with ETHTOOL_SRINGPARAM ioctl request.

Like the ioctl implementation, the generic ethtool code checks if supplied
values do not exceed driver defined limits; if they do, first offending
attribute is reported using extack.
