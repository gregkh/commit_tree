net: dsa: Down cpu/dsa ports phylink will control

DSA and CPU ports can be configured in two ways. By default, the
driver should configure such ports to there maximum bandwidth. For
most use cases, this is sufficient. When this default is insufficient,
a phylink instance can be bound to such ports, and phylink will
configure the port, e.g. based on fixed-link properties. phylink
assumes the port is initially down. Given that the driver should have
already configured it to its maximum speed, ask the driver to down
the port before instantiating the phylink instance.
