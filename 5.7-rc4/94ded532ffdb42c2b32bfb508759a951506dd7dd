drm/bridge: dumb-vga-dac: Rename internal symbols to simple-bridge

The dumb-vga-dac driver is a simple DRM bridge driver for simple VGA
DACs that don't require configuration. Other non-VGA bridges fall in a
similar category, and would benefit from a common driver. Prepare for
this by renaming the internal symbols from dumb-vga-dac to
simple-bridge.
