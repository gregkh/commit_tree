ASoC: wm_adsp: Use scnprintf() for the limited buffer output

snprintf() is a hard-to-use function, it's especially difficult to use
it for concatenating substrings in a buffer with a limited size.
Since snprintf() returns the would-be-output size, not the actual
size, the subsequent use of snprintf() may point to the incorrect
position.

Use scnprintf() instead for fixing such potential errors.
