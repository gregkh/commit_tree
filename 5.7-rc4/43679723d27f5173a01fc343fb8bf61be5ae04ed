merging pick_link() with get_link(), part 1

Move restoring LOOKUP_PARENT and zeroing nd->stack.name[0] past
the call of get_link() (nothing _currently_ uses them in there).
That allows to moved the call of may_follow_link() into get_link()
as well, since now the presence of LOOKUP_PARENT distinguishes
the callers from each other (link_path_walk() has it, trailing_symlink()
doesn't).

Preparations for folding trailing_symlink() into callers (lookup_last()
and do_last()) and changing the calling conventions of those.  Next
stage after that will have get_link() call migrate into walk_component(),
then - into step_into().  It's tricky enough to warrant doing that
in stages, unfortunately...
