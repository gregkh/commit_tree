lockdep: Add posixtimer context tracing bits

Splitting run_posix_cpu_timers() into two parts is work in progress which
is stuck on other entry code related problems. The heavy lifting which
involves locking of sighand lock will be moved into task context so the
necessary execution time is burdened on the task and not on interrupt
context.

Until this work completes lockdep with the spinlock nesting rules enabled
would emit warnings for this known context.

Prevent it by setting "->irq_config = 1" for the invocation of
run_posix_cpu_timers() so lockdep does not complain when sighand lock is
acquried. This will be removed once the split is completed.
