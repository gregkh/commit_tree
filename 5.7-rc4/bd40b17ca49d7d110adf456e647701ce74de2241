XArray: Fix xa_find_next for large multi-index entries

Coverity pointed out that xas_sibling() was shifting xa_offset without
promoting it to an unsigned long first, so the shift could cause an
overflow and we'd get the wrong answer.  The fix is obvious, and the
new test-case provokes UBSAN to report an error:
runtime error: shift exponent 60 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'
