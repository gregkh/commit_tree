tools lib api fs: Move cgroupsfs_find_mountpoint()

Move it from tools/perf/util/cgroup.c as it can be used by other places.
Note that cgroup filesystem is different from others since it's usually
mounted separately (in v1) for each subsystem.

I just copied the code with a little modification to pass a name of
subsystem.
