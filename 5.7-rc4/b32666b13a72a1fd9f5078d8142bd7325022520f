KVM: x86: Introduce cpuid_entry_{change,set,clear}() mutators

Introduce mutators to modify feature bits in CPUID entries and use the
new mutators where applicable.  Using the mutators eliminates the need
to manually specify the register to modify query at no extra cost and
will allow adding runtime consistency checks on the function/index in a
future patch.

No functional change intended.
