ceph: cap tracking for async directory operations

Track and correctly handle directory caps for asynchronous operations.
Add aliases for Frc caps that we now designate at Dcu caps (when dealing
with directories).

Unlike file caps, we don't reclaim these when the session goes away, and
instead preemptively release them. In-flight async dirops are instead
handled during reconnect phase. The client needs to re-do a synchronous
operation in order to re-get directory caps.
