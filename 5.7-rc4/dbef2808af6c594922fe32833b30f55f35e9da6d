KVM: VMX: fix crash cleanup when KVM wasn't used

If KVM wasn't used at all before we crash the cleanup procedure fails with
 BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffffffffc8
 #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode

 Oops: 0000 [#8] SMP PTI
 CPU: 0 PID: 3542 Comm: bash Kdump: loaded Tainted: G      D           5.6.0-rc2+ #823
 RIP: 0010:crash_vmclear_local_loaded_vmcss.cold+0x19/0x51 [kvm_intel]

The root cause is that loaded_vmcss_on_cpu list is not yet initialized,
we initialize it in hardware_enable() but this only happens when we start
a VM.

Previously, we used to have a bitmap with enabled CPUs and that was
preventing [masking] the issue.

Initialized loaded_vmcss_on_cpu list earlier, right before we assign
crash_vmclear_loaded_vmcss pointer. blocked_vcpu_on_cpu list and
blocked_vcpu_on_cpu_lock are moved altogether for consistency.
