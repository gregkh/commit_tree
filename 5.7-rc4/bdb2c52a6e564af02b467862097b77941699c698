ARM: tegra: Update sound node clocks in device tree

clk_out_1, clk_out_2, and clk_out_3 are part of Tegra PMC block but were
previously erroneously provided by the clock and reset controller.

clk_out_1 is dedicated for audio mclk on Tegra30 through Tegra210.

This patch updates device tree sound node to use clk_out_1 from the PMC
provider as mclk and uses assigned-clock properties to specify clock
parents for clk_out_1 and extern1.
