i40iw: Report correct firmware version

The driver uses a hard-coded value for FW version and reports an
inconsistent FW version between ibv_devinfo and
/sys/class/infiniband/i40iw/fw_ver.

Retrieve the FW version via a Control QP (CQP) operation and report it
consistently across sysfs and query device.
