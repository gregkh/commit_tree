ACPI / AC: Cleanup DMI quirk table

The 3 different entries we have sofar all use different identation and
2 of the use DMI_MATCH where as 1 unnecessarily used DMI_EXACT_MATCH
Fix this to just use full tab idents for each level and DMI_MATCH
everywhere and sort the entries alphabetically.

Also add a bit of text to the comments explaining why the quirk is
necessary.
