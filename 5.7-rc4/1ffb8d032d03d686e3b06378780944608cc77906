acpi/x86: add a kernel parameter to disable ACPI BGRT

BGRT is for displaying seamless OEM logo from booting to login screen;
however, this mechanism does not always work well on all configurations
and the OEM logo can be displayed multiple times. This looks worse than
without BGRT enabled.

This patch adds a kernel parameter to disable BGRT in boot time. This is
easier than re-compiling a kernel with CONFIG_ACPI_BGRT disabled.
