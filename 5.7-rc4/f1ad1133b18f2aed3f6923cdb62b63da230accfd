irqchip/sifive-plic: Add support for multiple PLICs

Current, PLIC driver can support only 1 PLIC on the board. However,
there can be multiple PLICs present on a two socket systems in RISC-V.

Modify the driver so that each PLIC handler can have a information
about individual PLIC registers and an irqdomain associated with it.

Tested on two socket RISC-V system based on VCU118 FPGA connected via
OmniXtend protocol.
