macsec: avoid to set wrong mtu

When a macsec interface is created, the mtu is calculated with the lower
interface's mtu value.
If the mtu of lower interface is lower than the length, which is needed
by macsec interface, macsec's mtu value will be overflowed.
So, if the lower interface's mtu is too low, macsec interface's mtu
should be set to 0.

Test commands:
    ip link add dummy0 mtu 10 type dummy
    ip link add macsec0 link dummy0 type macsec
    ip link show macsec0

Before:
    11: macsec0@dummy0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 4294967274
After:
    11: macsec0@dummy0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 0
