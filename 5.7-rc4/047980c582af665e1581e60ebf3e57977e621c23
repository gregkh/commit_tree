spi: add driver for ar934x spi controller

This patch adds driver for SPI controller found in Qualcomm Atheros
AR934x/QCA95xx SoCs.
This controller is a superset of the already supported qca,ar7100-spi.
Besides the bit-bang mode in spi-ath79.c, this new controller added
a new "shift register" mode, allowing faster spi operations.
