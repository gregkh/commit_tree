ice: Only allow tagged bcast/mcast traffic for VF in port VLAN

Currently the VF can see other's broadcast and multicast traffic because
it always has a VLAN filter for VLAN 0. Fix this by removing/adding the
VF's VLAN 0 filter when a port VLAN is added/removed respectively.

This required a few changes.

1. Move where we add VLAN 0 by default for the VF into
ice_alloc_vsi_res() because this is when we determine if a port VLAN is
present for load and reset.

2. Moved where we kill the old port VLAN filter in
ice_set_vf_port_vlan() to the very end of the function because it allows
us to save the old port VLAN configuration upon any failure case.

3. During adding/removing of a port VLAN via ice_set_vf_port_vlan() we
also need to remove/add the VLAN 0 filter rule respectively.

4. Improve log messages.
