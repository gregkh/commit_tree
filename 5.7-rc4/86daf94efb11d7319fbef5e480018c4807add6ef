mm/memcontrol.c: allocate shrinker_map on appropriate NUMA node

The shrinker_map may be touched from any cpu (e.g., a bit there may be set
by a task running everywhere) but kswapd is always bound to specific node.
So allocate shrinker_map from the related NUMA node to respect its NUMA
locality.  Also, this follows generic way we use for allocation of memcg's
per-node data.
