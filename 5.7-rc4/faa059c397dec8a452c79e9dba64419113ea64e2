rcu: Optimize and protect atomic_cmpxchg() loop

This commit reworks the atomic_cmpxchg() loop in rcu_eqs_special_set()
to do only the initial read from the current CPU's rcu_data structure's
->dynticks field explicitly.  On subsequent passes, this value is instead
retained from the failing atomic_cmpxchg() operation.
