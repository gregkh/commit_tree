drm/amd/display: Link training TPS1 workaround add back in dpcd

[Why]
Previously implemented early_cr_pattern we mistook dp_hw_link_settings
for a redundant call of dpcd_set_link_settings

[How]
revert the changes to dpcd_set_link_settings calls for this workaround.
Do not need to revert the entire change since it only affects patched
case
