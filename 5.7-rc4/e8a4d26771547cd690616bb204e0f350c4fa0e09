ceph: clean up kick_flushing_inode_caps()

The last thing that this function does is release i_ceph_lock, so
have the caller do that instead. Add a lockdep assertion to
ensure that the function is always called with i_ceph_lock held.
Change the prototype to take a ceph_inode_info pointer and drop
the separate mdsc argument as we can get that from the session.

While at it, make it non-static.  We'll need this to kick any
flushing caps once the create reply comes in.
