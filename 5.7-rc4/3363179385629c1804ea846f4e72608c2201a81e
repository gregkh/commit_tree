um: Make CONFIG_STATIC_LINK actually static

Currently, CONFIG_STATIC_LINK can be enabled with options which cannot
be statically linked, namely UML_NET_VECTOR, UML_NET_VDE, and
UML_NET_PCAP; this is because glibc tries to load NSS which does not
support being statically linked. So make CONFIG_STATIC_LINK depend on
!UML_NET_VECTOR && !UML_NET_VDE && !UML_NET_PCAP.
