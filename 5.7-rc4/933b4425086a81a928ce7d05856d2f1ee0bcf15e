net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix duplicate vlan warning

When setting VLANs on DSA switches, the VLAN is added to both the port
concerned as well as the CPU port by dsa_slave_vlan_add(), as well as
any DSA ports.  If multiple ports are configured with the same VLAN ID,
this triggers a warning on the CPU and DSA ports.

Avoid this warning for CPU and DSA ports.
