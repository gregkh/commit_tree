tools/libbpf: Add support for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM

Since BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM uses the same attaching mechanism as
BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING, the common logic is refactored into a static
function bpf_program__attach_btf_id.

A new API call bpf_program__attach_lsm is still added to avoid userspace
conflicts if this ever changes in the future.
