mptcp: drop req socket remote_key* fields

We don't need them, as we can use the current ingress opt
data instead. Setting them in syn_recv_sock() may causes
inconsistent mptcp socket status, as per previous commit.

Fixes: cc7972ea1932 ("mptcp: parse and emit MP_CAPABLE option according to v1 spec")
