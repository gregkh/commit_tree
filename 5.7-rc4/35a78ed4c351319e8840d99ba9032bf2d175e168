net/mlx5e: Allow mlx5e_switch_priv_channels to fail and recover

Currently mlx5e_switch_priv_channels expects that the preactivate hook
doesn't fail, however, it can fail, because it may set hardware
parameters. This commit addresses this issue and provides a way to
recover from failures of the preactivate hook: the old channels are not
closed until the point where nothing can fail anymore, so in case
preactivate fails, the driver can roll back the old channels and
activate them again.
