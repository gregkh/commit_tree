bpf: Enable retrieval of socket cookie for bind/post-bind hook

We currently make heavy use of the socket cookie in BPF's connect(),
sendmsg() and recvmsg() hooks for load-balancing decisions. However,
it is currently not enabled/implemented in BPF {post-}bind hooks
where it can later be used in combination for correlation in the tc
egress path, for example.
