USB: serial: relax unthrottle memory barrier

Commit a8d78d9f3856 ("USB: serial: clean up throttle handling")
converted the throttle handling to use atomic bitops. This means that we
can relax the smp_mb() in unthrottle() to smp_mb__after_atomic(), which
for example is a no-op on architectures like x86 that provide fully
ordered atomics.
