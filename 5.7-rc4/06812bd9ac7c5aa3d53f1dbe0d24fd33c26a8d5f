drm/i915: Add missing commas to dbuf tables

The preferred style is to sprinkle commas after each array and
structure initialization, whether or not it happens to be the
last element/member (only exception being sentinel entries which
never have anything after them). This leads to much prettier
diffs if/when new elements/members get added to the end of the
initialization. We're not bound by some ancient silly mandate
to omit the final comma.
