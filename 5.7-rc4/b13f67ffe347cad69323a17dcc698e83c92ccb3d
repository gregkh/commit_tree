f2fs: fix to avoid potential deadlock

We should always check F2FS_I(inode)->cp_task condition in prior to other
conditions in __should_serialize_io() to avoid deadloop described in
commit 040d2bb318d1 ("f2fs: fix to avoid deadloop if data_flush is on"),
however we break this rule when we support compression, fix it.
