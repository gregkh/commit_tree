drm/i915/gem: Drop relocation slowpath

Since the relocations are no longer performed under a global
struct_mutex, or any other lock, that is also held by pagefault handlers,
we can relax and allow our fast path to take a fault. As we no longer
need to abort the fast path for lock avoidance, we no longer need the
slow path handling at all.
