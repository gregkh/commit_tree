dax, pmem: Add a dax operation zero_page_range

Add a dax operation zero_page_range, to zero a page. This will also clear any
known poison in the page being zeroed.

As of now, zeroing of one page is allowed in a single call. There
are no callers which are trying to zero more than a page in a single call.
Once we grow the callers which zero more than a page in single call, we
can add that support. Primary reason for not doing that yet is that this
will add little complexity in dm implementation where a range might be
spanning multiple underlying targets and one will have to split the range
into multiple sub ranges and call zero_page_range() on individual targets.
