s390/pci: Fix zpci_alloc_domain() over allocation

Until now zpci_alloc_domain() only prevented more than
CONFIG_PCI_NR_FUNCTIONS from being added when using automatic domain
allocation. When explicit UIDs were defined UIDs above
CONFIG_PCI_NR_FUNCTIONS were not counted at all.
When more PCI functions are added this could lead to various errors
including under sized IRQ vectors and similar issues.

Fix this by explicitly tracking the number of allocated domains.
