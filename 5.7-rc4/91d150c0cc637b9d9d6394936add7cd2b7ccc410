efi/libstub: Clean up command line parsing routine

We currently parse the command non-destructively, to avoid having to
allocate memory for a copy before passing it to the standard parsing
routines that are used by the core kernel, and which modify the input
to delineate the parsed tokens with NUL characters.

Instead, we call strstr() and strncmp() to go over the input multiple
times, and match prefixes rather than tokens, which implies that we
would match, e.g., 'nokaslrfoo' in the stub and disable KASLR, while
the kernel would disregard the option and run with KASLR enabled.

In order to avoid having to reason about whether and how this behavior
may be abused, let's clean up the parsing routines, and rebuild them
on top of the existing helpers.
