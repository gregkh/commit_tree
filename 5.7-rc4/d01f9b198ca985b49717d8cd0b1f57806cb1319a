bpf: Factor out hashtab bucket lock operations

As a preparation for making the BPF locking RT friendly, factor out the
hash bucket lock operations into inline functions. This allows to do the
necessary RT modification in one place instead of sprinkling it all over
the place. No functional change.

The now unused htab argument of the lock/unlock functions will be used in
the next step which adds PREEMPT_RT support.
