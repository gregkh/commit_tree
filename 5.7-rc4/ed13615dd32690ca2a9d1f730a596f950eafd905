s390/qeth: simplify RX buffer tracking

Since RX buffers may contain multiple packets, qeth's NAPI poll code can
exhaust its budget in the middle of an RX buffer. Thus we keep track of
our current position within the active RX buffer, so we can resume
processing here in the next NAPI poll period.

Clean up that code by tracking the index of the active buffer element,
instead of a pointer to it.
Also simplify the code that advances to the next RX buffer when the
current buffer has been fully processed.

v2: - remove QDIO_ELEMENT_NO() macro (davem)
