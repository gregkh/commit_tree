remoteproc/omap: Add a sanity check for DSP boot address alignment

The DSP remote processors on OMAP SoCs require a boot register to
be programmed with a boot address, and this boot address needs to
be on a 1KB boundary. The current code is simply masking the boot
address appropriately without performing any sanity checks before
releasing the resets. An unaligned boot address results in an
undefined execution behavior and can result in various bus errors
like MMU Faults or L3 NoC errors. Such errors are hard to debug and
can be easily avoided by adding a sanity check for the alignment
before booting a DSP remote processor.
