tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Avoid duplicate names for json parsing

For the command
"intel-speed-select perf-profile info":

There are two instances of “speed-select-turbo-freq” underneath
“perf-profile-level-0” for each package. When we load the output into
python with json.load(), the second instance overwrites the first.

Result is that we can only access:
"speed-select-turbo-freq": {
            "bucket-0": {
              "high-priority-cores-count": "2",
              "high-priority-max-frequency(MHz)": "3000",
              "high-priority-max-avx2-frequency(MHz)": "2800",
              "high-priority-max-avx512-frequency(MHz)": "2600"
            },
Because it is a duplicate of "speed-select-turbo-freq": "disabled"
Same is true for "speed-select-base-freq".

To avoid this add "-properties" suffix for the second instance to
differentiate.
