mm/migrate.c: unify "not queued for migration" handling in do_pages_move()

It can currently happen that we store the status of a page twice:
* Once we detect that it is already on the target node
* Once we moved a bunch of pages, and a page that's already on the
  target node is contained in the current interval.

Let's simplify the code and always call do_move_pages_to_node() in case we
did not queue a page for migration.  Note that pages that are already on
the target node are not added to the pagelist and are, therefore, ignored
by do_move_pages_to_node() - there is no functional change.

The status of such a page is now only stored once.
