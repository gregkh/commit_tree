scsi: ufs: set device as active power mode after resetting device

Currently ufshcd driver assumes that bInitPowerMode parameter is not
changed by any vendors thus device power mode can be set as "Active" during
initialization.

According to UFS JEDEC specification, device power mode shall be "Active"
after HW Reset is triggered if the bInitPowerMode parameter in Device
Descriptor is default value.

By above description, we can set device power mode as "Active" after device
reset is triggered by vendor's callback. With this change, the link startup
performance can be improved in some cases by not setting link_startup_again
as true in ufshcd_link_startup().
