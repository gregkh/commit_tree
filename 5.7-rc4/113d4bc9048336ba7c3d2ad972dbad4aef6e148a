objtool: Fix clang switch table edge case

Clang has the ability to create a switch table which is not a jump
table, but is rather a table of string pointers.  This confuses objtool,
because it sees the relocations for the string pointers and assumes
they're part of a jump table:

  drivers/ata/sata_dwc_460ex.o: warning: objtool: sata_dwc_bmdma_start_by_tag()+0x3a2: can't find switch jump table
  net/ceph/messenger.o: warning: objtool: ceph_con_workfn()+0x47c: can't find switch jump table

Make objtool's find_jump_table() smart enough to distinguish between a
switch jump table (which has relocations to text addresses in the same
function as the original instruction) and other anonymous rodata (which
may have relocations to elsewhere).
