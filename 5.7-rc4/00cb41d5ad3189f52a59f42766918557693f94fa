riscv: add alignment for text, rodata and data sections

The kernel mapping will tried to optimize its mapping by using bigger
size. In rv64, it tries to use PMD_SIZE, and tryies to use PGDIR_SIZE in
rv32. To ensure that the start address of these sections could fit the
mapping entry size, make them align to the biggest alignment.

Define a macro SECTION_ALIGN because the HPAGE_SIZE or PMD_SIZE, etc.,
are invisible in linker script.

This patch is prepared for STRICT_KERNEL_RWX support.
