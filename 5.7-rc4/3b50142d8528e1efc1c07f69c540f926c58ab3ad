MAINTAINERS: sort field names for all entries

This sorts the actual field names too, potentially causing even more
chaos and confusion at merge time if you have edited the MAINTAINERS
file.  But the end result is a more consistent layout, and hopefully
it's a one-time pain minimized by doing this just before the -rc1
release.

This was entirely scripted:

  ./scripts/parse-maintainers.pl --input=MAINTAINERS --output=MAINTAINERS --order
