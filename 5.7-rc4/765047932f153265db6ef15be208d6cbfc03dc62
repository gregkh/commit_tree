sched/pelt: Add support to track thermal pressure

Extrapolating on the existing framework to track rt/dl utilization using
pelt signals, add a similar mechanism to track thermal pressure. The
difference here from rt/dl utilization tracking is that, instead of
tracking time spent by a CPU running a RT/DL task through util_avg, the
average thermal pressure is tracked through load_avg. This is because
thermal pressure signal is weighted time "delta" capacity unlike util_avg
which is binary. "delta capacity" here means delta between the actual
capacity of a CPU and the decreased capacity a CPU due to a thermal event.

In order to track average thermal pressure, a new sched_avg variable
avg_thermal is introduced. Function update_thermal_load_avg can be called
to do the periodic bookkeeping (accumulate, decay and average) of the
thermal pressure.
