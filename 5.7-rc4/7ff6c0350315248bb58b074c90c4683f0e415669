KVM: x86: Remove stateful CPUID handling

Remove the code for handling stateful CPUID 0x2 and mark the associated
flags as deprecated.  WARN if host CPUID 0x2.0.AL > 1, i.e. if by some
miracle a host with stateful CPUID 0x2 is encountered.

No known CPU exists that supports hardware accelerated virtualization
_and_ a stateful CPUID 0x2.  Barring an extremely contrived nested
virtualization scenario, stateful CPUID support is dead code.
