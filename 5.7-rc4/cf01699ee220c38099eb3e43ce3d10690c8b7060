tools/vm: fix cross-compile build

Commit 7ed1c1901fe5 ("tools: fix cross-compile var clobbering") moved
the setup of the CC variable to tools/scripts/Makefile.include to make
the behavior consistent across all the tools Makefiles.

As the vm tools missed the include we end up with the wrong CC in a
cross-compiling evironment.
