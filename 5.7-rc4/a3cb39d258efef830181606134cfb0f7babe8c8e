serial: core: Allow detach and attach serial device for console

In the future we would like to disable power management on the serial devices
used as kernel consoles to avoid weird behaviour in some cases. However,
disabling PM may prevent system to go to deep sleep states, which in its turn
leads to the higher power consumption.

Tony Lindgren proposed a work around, i.e. allow user to detach such consoles
to make PM working again. In case user wants to see what's going on, it also
provides a mechanism to attach console back.
