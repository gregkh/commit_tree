bpf: sockmap: Move generic sockmap hooks from BPF TCP

The init, close and unhash handlers from TCP sockmap are generic,
and can be reused by UDP sockmap. Move the helpers into the sockmap code
base and expose them. This requires tcp_bpf_get_proto and tcp_bpf_clone to
be conditional on BPF_STREAM_PARSER.

The moved functions are unmodified, except that sk_psock_unlink is
renamed to sock_map_unlink to better match its behaviour.
