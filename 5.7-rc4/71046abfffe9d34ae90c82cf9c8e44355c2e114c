net: qrtr: Fix FIXME related to qrtr_ns_init()

The 2 second delay before calling qrtr_ns_init() meant that the remote
processors would register as endpoints in qrtr and the say_hello() call
would therefor broadcast the outgoing HELLO to them. With the HELLO
handshake corrected this delay is no longer needed.
