dm clone: Add missing casts to prevent overflows and data corruption

Add missing casts when converting from regions to sectors.

In case BITS_PER_LONG == 32, the lack of the appropriate casts can lead
to overflows and miscalculation of the device sector.

As a result, we could end up discarding and/or copying the wrong parts
of the device, thus corrupting the device's data.
