m68k: mm: Improve kernel_page_table()

With the PTE-tables now only being 256 bytes, allocating a full page
for them is a giant waste. Start by improving the boot time allocator
such that init_mm initialization will at least have optimal memory
density.

Much thanks to Will Deacon in help with debugging and ferreting out
lost information on these dusty MMUs.

Notes:

 - _TABLE_MASK is reduced to account for the shorter (256 byte)
   alignment of pte-tables, per the manual, table entries should only
   ever have state in the low 4 bits (Used,WrProt,Desc1,Desc0) so it is
   still longer than strictly required. (Thanks Will!!!)

 - Also use kernel_page_table() for the 020/030 zero_pgtable case and
   consequently remove the zero_pgtable init hack (will fix up later).
