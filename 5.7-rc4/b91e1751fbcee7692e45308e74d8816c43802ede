RDMA/mlx5: Simplify how the MR cache bucket is located

There are many bad APIs here that are accepting a cache bucket index
instead of a bucket pointer. Many of the callers already have a bucket
pointer, so this results in a lot of confusing uses of order2idx().

Pass the struct mlx5_cache_ent into add_keys(), remove_keys(), and
alloc_cached_mr().

Once the MR is in the cache, store the cache bucket pointer directly in
the MR, replacing the 'bool allocated_from cache'.

In the end there is only one place that needs to form index from order,
alloc_mr_from_cache(). Increase the safety of this function by disallowing
it from accessing cache entries in the ODP special area.
