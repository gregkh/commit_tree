mtd: spi-nor: Add generic formula for SR block protection handling

The current mainline locking was restricted and could only be applied
to flashes that have 3 block protection bits and fixed locking ratio.

A new method of normalization was reached at the end of the discussion [1].

    (1) - if bp slot is insufficient.
    (2) - if bp slot is sufficient.

    if (bp_slots_needed > bp_slots)    // (1)
        min_prot_length = sector_size << (bp_slots_needed - bp_slots);
    else                               // (2)
        min_prot_length = sector_size;

This patch changes logic to handle block protection based on min_prot_length.
It is suitable for the overall flashes with exception of some corner cases
(see EON and catalyst) and easy to extend and apply for the case of 2bit or
4bit block protection.
