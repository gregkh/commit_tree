platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Add Atom based Jasper Lake (JSL) platform support

Add Jasper Lake to the list of the platforms that intel_pmc_core
driver supports for pmc_core device.

Just like Ice Lake, Tiger Lake and Elkhart Lake, Jasper Lake can also
reuse all the Cannon Lake PCH IPs. Also, it uses the same PCH IPs of
Tiger Lake, no additional effort is needed to enable but to simply reuse
them.
