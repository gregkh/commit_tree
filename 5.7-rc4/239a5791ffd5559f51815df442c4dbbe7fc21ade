dynamic_debug: allow to work if debugfs is disabled

With the realization that having debugfs enabled on "production" systems
is generally not a good idea, debugfs is being disabled from more and
more platforms over time.  However, the functionality of dynamic
debugging still is needed at times, and since it relies on debugfs for
its user api, having debugfs disabled also forces dynamic debug to be
disabled.

To get around this, also create the "control" file for dynamic_debug in
procfs.  This allows people turn on debugging as needed at runtime for
individual driverfs and subsystems.
