net: hns3: fix set and get link ksettings issue

When device is not open, the service task which update the port
information per second is not running. In this case, the port
capabilities, including speed ability, autoneg ability, media type,
may be incorrect. Then get/set link ksetting may fail.

This patch fixes it by updating the port information before getting/
setting link ksettings when device is not open, and start timer
task immediately by setting delay time to 0 when device opens.
