x86/boot/compressed: Fix reloading of GDTR post-relocation

The following commit:

  ef5a7b5eb13e ("efi/x86: Remove GDT setup from efi_main")

introduced GDT setup into the 32-bit kernel's startup_32, and reloads
the GDTR after relocating the kernel for paranoia's sake.

A followup commit:

   32d009137a56 ("x86/boot: Reload GDTR after copying to the end of the buffer")

introduced a similar GDTR reload in the 64-bit kernel as well.

The GDTR is adjusted by (init_size-_end), however this may not be the
correct offset to apply if the kernel was loaded at a misaligned address
or below LOAD_PHYSICAL_ADDR, as in that case the decompression buffer
has an additional offset from the original load address.

This should never happen for a conformant bootloader, but we're being
paranoid anyway, so just store the new GDT address in there instead of
adding any offsets, which is simpler as well.
