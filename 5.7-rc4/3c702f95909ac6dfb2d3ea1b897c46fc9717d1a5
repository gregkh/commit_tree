xfs: refactor unmount record writing

Separate out the unmount record writing from the rest of the
ticket and log state futzing necessary to make it work. This is
a no-op, just makes the code cleaner and places the unmount record
formatting and writing alongside the commit record formatting and
writing code.

We can also get rid of the ticket flag clearing before the
xlog_write() call because it no longer cares about the state of
XLOG_TIC_INITED.
