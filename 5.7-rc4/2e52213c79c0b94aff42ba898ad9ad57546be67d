mptcp: avoid work queue scheduling if possible

We can't lock_sock() the mptcp socket from the subflow data_ready callback,
it would result in ABBA deadlock with the subflow socket lock.

We can however grab the spinlock: if that succeeds and the mptcp socket
is not owned at the moment, we can process the new skbs right away
without deferring this to the work queue.

This avoids the schedule_work and hence the small delay until the
work item is processed.
