ftrace: Create set_ftrace_notrace_pid to not trace tasks

There's currently a way to select a task that should only be traced by
functions, but there's no way to select a task not to be traced by the
function tracer. Add a set_ftrace_notrace_pid file that acts the same as
set_ftrace_pid (and is also affected by function-fork), but the task pids in
this file will not be traced even if they are listed in the set_ftrace_pid
file. This makes it easy for tools like trace-cmd to "hide" itself from the
function tracer when it is recording other tasks.
