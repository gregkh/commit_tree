x86: remove always-defined CONFIG_AS_CFI_SECTIONS

CONFIG_AS_CFI_SECTIONS was introduced by commit 9e565292270a ("x86:
Use .cfi_sections for assembly code").

We raise the minimal supported binutils version from time to time.
The last bump was commit 1fb12b35e5ff ("kbuild: Raise the minimum
required binutils version to 2.21").

I confirmed the code in $(call as-instr,...) can be assembled by the
binutils 2.21 assembler and also by LLVM integrated assembler.

Remove CONFIG_AS_CFI_SECTIONS, which is always defined.
