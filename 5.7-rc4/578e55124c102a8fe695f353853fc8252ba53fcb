mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Remove VXLAN checks during FID membership

As explained in previous patch, VXLAN devices now take a reference on
the FID and not only local ports. Therefore, there is no need for local
ports to check if they need to set a VNI on the FID when they join the
FID.

Remove these unnecessary checks.
