ACPI: NUMA: Up-level "map to online node" functionality

The acpi_map_pxm_to_online_node() helper is used to find the closest
online node to a given proximity domain. This is used to map devices in
a proximity domain with no online memory or cpus to the closest online
node and populate a device's 'numa_node' property. The numa_node
property allows applications to be migrated "close" to a resource.

In preparation for providing a generic facility to optionally map an
address range to its closest online node, or the node the range would
represent were it to be onlined (target_node), up-level the core of
acpi_map_pxm_to_online_node() to a generic mm/numa helper.
