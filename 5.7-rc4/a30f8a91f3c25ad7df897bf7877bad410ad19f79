cpufreq: imx-cpufreq-dt: Add "cpu-supply" property check

The cpufreq-dt driver allows cpufreq driver enabled without valid
regulator assigned, however, all i.MX platforms using cpufreq-dt
driver now require valid regulator, add "cpu-supply" property check
to avoid i.MX platforms' cpufreq enabled without valid regulator
and lead to system unstable.
