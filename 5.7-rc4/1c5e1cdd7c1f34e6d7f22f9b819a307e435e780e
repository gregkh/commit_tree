ACPI/PCI: pci_link: use extended_irq union member when setting ext-irq shareable

The case ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_EXTENDED_IRQ inside acpi_pci_link_set()
is correctly using resource->res.data.extended_irq.foo for most settings,
but for the shareable setting it so far has accidentally been using
resource->res.data.irq.shareable instead of
resource->res.data.extended_irq.shareable.

Note that the old code happens to also work because the shareable field
offset is the same for both the acpi_resource_irq and
acpi_resource_extended_irq structs.
