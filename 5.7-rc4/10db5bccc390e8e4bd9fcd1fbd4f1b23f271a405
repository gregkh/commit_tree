ALSA: hda: Honor PM disablement in PM freeze and thaw_noirq ops

freeze_noirq and thaw_noirq need to check the PM availability like
other PM ops.  There are cases where the device got disabled due to
the error, and the PM operation should be ignored for that.

Fixes: 3e6db33aaf1d ("ALSA: hda - Set SKL+ hda controller power at freeze() and thaw()")
