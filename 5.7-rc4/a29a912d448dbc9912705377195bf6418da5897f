ice: Validate config for SW DCB map

Validate the inputs for SW DCB config received either via lldptool or pcap
file. And don't apply DCB for bad bandwidth inputs. Without this patch, any
config having bad inputs will cause the loss of link making PF unusable
even after driver reload. Recoverable only via system reboot.
