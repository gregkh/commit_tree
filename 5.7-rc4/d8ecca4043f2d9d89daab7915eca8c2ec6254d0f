x86/mce/dev-mcelog: Dynamically allocate space for machine check records

We have had a hard coded limit of 32 machine check records since the
dawn of time.  But as numbers of cores increase, it is possible for
more than 32 errors to be reported before a user process reads from
/dev/mcelog. In this case the additional errors are lost.

Keep 32 as the minimum. But tune the maximum value up based on the
number of processors.
