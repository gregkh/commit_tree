drm/i915/execlists: Take a reference while capturing the guilty request

Thanks to preempt-to-busy, we leave the request on the HW as we submit
the preemption request. This means that the request may complete at any
moment as we process HW events, and in particular the request may be
retired as we are planning to capture it for a preemption timeout.

Be more careful while obtaining the request to capture after a
preemption timeout, and check to see if it completed before we were able
to put it on the on-hold list. If we do see it did complete just before
we capture the request, proclaim the preemption-timeout a false positive
and pardon the reset as we should hit an arbitration point momentarily
and so be able to process the preemption.

Note that even after we move the request to be on hold it may be retired
(as the reset to stop the HW comes after), so we do require to hold our
own reference as we work on the request for capture (and all of the
peeking at state within the request needs to be carefully protected).
