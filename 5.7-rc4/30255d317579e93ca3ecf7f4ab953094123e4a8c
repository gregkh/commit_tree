bpftool: Print as a string for char array

A char[] is currently printed as an integer array.
This patch will print it as a string when
1) The array element type is an one byte int
2) The array element type has a BTF_INT_CHAR encoding or
   the array element type's name is "char"
3) All characters is between (0x1f, 0x7f) and it is terminated
   by a null character.
