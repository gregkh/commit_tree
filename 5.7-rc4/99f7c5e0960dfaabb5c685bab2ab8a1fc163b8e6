net: bridge: vlan options: rename br_vlan_opts_eq to br_vlan_opts_eq_range

It is more appropriate name as it shows the intent of why we need to
check the options' state. It also allows us to give meaning to the two
arguments of the function: the first is the current vlan (v_curr) being
checked if it could enter the range ending in the second one (range_end).
