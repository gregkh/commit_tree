media: imx: imx7-media-csi: Fix video field handling

Commit 4791bd7d6adc ("media: imx: Try colorimetry at both sink and
source pads") reworked the way that formats are set on the sink pad of
the CSI subdevice, and accidentally removed video field handling.
Restore it by defaulting to V4L2_FIELD_NONE if the field value isn't
supported, with the only two supported value being V4L2_FIELD_NONE and
V4L2_FIELD_INTERLACED.
