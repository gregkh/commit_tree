mmc: sdhci-sprd: Set the missing MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY flag

The Spreadtrum host controller supports HW busy detection for commands with
R1B responses, but also for I/O operations. This means when the host gets a
transfer complete event, that always indicates the busy signal is released.

Let's inform the mmc core about this, via setting the corresponding
MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY flag, as to remove some redundant software busy
polling.
