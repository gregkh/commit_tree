amd-xgbe: Use __napi_schedule() in BH context

The driver uses __napi_schedule_irqoff() which is fine as long as it is
invoked with disabled interrupts by everybody. Since the commit
mentioned below the driver may invoke xgbe_isr_task() in tasklet/softirq
context. This may lead to list corruption if another driver uses
__napi_schedule_irqoff() in IRQ context.

Use __napi_schedule() which safe to use from IRQ and softirq context.
