EDAC/mc: Remove enable_per_layer_report function argument

Many functions carry the enable_per_layer_report argument. This is a
bool value indicating the error information contains some location
data where the error occurred. This can easily being determined by
checking the pos[] array for values. Negative values indicate there is
no location available. So if the top layer is negative, the error
location is unknown.

Just check if the top layer is negative and remove
enable_per_layer_report as function argument and also from struct
edac_raw_error_desc.
