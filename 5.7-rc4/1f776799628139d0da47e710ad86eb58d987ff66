tools/test/nvdimm: Fix out of tree build

Out of tree build using

   make M=tools/test/nvdimm O=/tmp/build -C /tmp/build

fails with the following error

make: Entering directory '/tmp/build'
  CC [M]  tools/testing/nvdimm/test/nfit.o
linux/tools/testing/nvdimm/test/nfit.c:19:10: fatal error: nd-core.h: No such file or directory
   19 | #include <nd-core.h>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.

That is because the kbuild file uses $(src) which points to
tools/testing/nvdimm, $(srctree) correctly points to root of the linux
source tree.
