thermal: imx_sc: add i.MX system controller thermal support

i.MX8QXP is an ARMv8 SoC which has a Cortex-M4 system controller
inside, the system controller is in charge of controlling power,
clock and thermal sensors etc..

This patch adds i.MX system controller thermal driver support,
Linux kernel has to communicate with system controller via MU
(message unit) IPC to get each thermal sensor's temperature,
it supports multiple sensors which are passed from device tree,
please see the binding doc for details.
