net/tls: fix const assignment warning

Building with some experimental patches, I came across a warning
in the tls code:

include/linux/compiler.h:215:30: warning: assignment discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type [-Wdiscarded-qualifiers]
  215 |  *(volatile typeof(x) *)&(x) = (val);  \
      |                              ^
net/tls/tls_main.c:650:4: note: in expansion of macro 'smp_store_release'
  650 |    smp_store_release(&saved_tcpv4_prot, prot);

This appears to be a legitimate warning about assigning a const pointer
into the non-const 'saved_tcpv4_prot' global. Annotate both the ipv4 and
ipv6 pointers 'const' to make the code internally consistent.

Fixes: 5bb4c45d466c ("net/tls: Read sk_prot once when building tls proto ops")
