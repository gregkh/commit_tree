xfs: use strndup_user in XFS_IOC_ATTRMULTI_BY_HANDLE

Simplify the user copy code by using strndup_user.  This means that we
now do one memory allocation per operation instead of one per ioctl,
but memory allocations are cheap compared to the actual file system
operations.  Also the error for an invalid path is now EINVAL or EFAULT
instead of the previous odd and undocumented ERANGE.
