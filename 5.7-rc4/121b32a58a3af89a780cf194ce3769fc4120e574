x86/entry/32: Use IA32-specific wrappers for syscalls taking 64-bit arguments

For the 32-bit syscall interface, 64-bit arguments (loff_t) are passed via
a pair of 32-bit registers.  These register pairs end up in consecutive stack
slots, which matches the C ABI for 64-bit arguments.  But when accessing the
registers directly from pt_regs, the wrapper needs to manually reassemble the
64-bit value.  These wrappers already exist for 32-bit compat, so make them
available to 32-bit native in preparation for enabling pt_regs-based syscalls.
