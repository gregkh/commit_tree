KVM: x86: Handle MPX CPUID adjustment in VMX code

Move the MPX CPUID adjustments into VMX to eliminate an instance of the
undesirable "unsigned f_* = *_supported ? F(*) : 0" pattern in the
common CPUID handling code.

Note, to maintain existing behavior, VMX must manually check for kernel
support for MPX by querying boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_MPX).  Previously,
do_cpuid_7_mask() masked MPX based on boot_cpu_data by invoking
cpuid_mask() on the associated cpufeatures word, but cpuid_mask() runs
prior to executing vmx_set_supported_cpuid().

No functional change intended.
