platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Add debugfs support to access live status registers

Just like status registers, Tiger Lake has another set of 6 registers
that help with status of the low power mode requirements. They are
latched on every PC10 entry/exit and S0ix.y entry/exit as well.

Though status and live status registers show the status of same list
of requirements, live status registers show the status of the low power
mode requirements at the time of reading.
