mtd: rawnand: Add support for Macronix NAND randomizer

Macronix NANDs support randomizer operation for user data scrambled,
which can be enabled with a SET_FEATURE.

User data written to the NAND device without randomizer is still readable
after randomizer function enabled.
The penalty of randomizer are subpage accesses prohibited and more time
period is needed in program operation and entering deep power-down mode.
i.e., tPROG 300us to 340us(randomizer enabled)

For more high-reliability concern, if subpage write not available with
hardware ECC and then to enable randomizer is recommended by default.
Driver checks byte 167 of Vendor Blocks in ONFI parameter page table
to see if this high-reliability function is supported. By adding a new
specific DT property in children nodes to enable randomizer function.
