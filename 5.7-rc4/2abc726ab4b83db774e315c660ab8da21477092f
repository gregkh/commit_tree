btrfs: do not init a reloc root if we aren't relocating

We previously were checking if the root had a dead root before accessing
root->reloc_root in order to avoid a use-after-free type bug.  However
this scenario happens after we've unset the reloc control, so we would
have been saved if we'd simply checked for fs_info->reloc_control.  At
this point during relocation we no longer need to be creating new reloc
roots, so simply move this check above the reloc_root checks to avoid
any future races and confusion.
