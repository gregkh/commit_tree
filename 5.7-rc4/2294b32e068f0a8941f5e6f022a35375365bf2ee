mm/filemap.c: rewrite pagecache_get_page documentation

 - These were never called PCG flags; they've been called FGP flags since
   their introduction in 2014.
 - The FGP_FOR_MMAP flag was misleadingly documented as if it was an
   alternative to FGP_CREAT instead of an option to it.
 - Rename the 'offset' parameter to 'index'.
 - Capitalisation, formatting, rewording.
