drm/connector: Split out orientation quirk detection (v2)

Not every platform needs quirk detection for panel orientation, so
split the drm_connector_init_panel_orientation_property into two
functions. One for platforms without the need for quirks, and the
other for platforms that need quirks.

Hans de Goede (changes in v2):

Rename the function from drm_connector_init_panel_orientation_property
to drm_connector_set_panel_orientation[_with_quirk] and pass in the
panel-orientation to set.

Beside the rename, also make the function set the passed in value
only once, if the value was set before (to a value other then
DRM_MODE_PANEL_ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN) make any further set calls a no-op.

This change is preparation for allowing the user to override the
panel-orientation for any connector from the kernel commandline.
When the panel-orientation is overridden this way, then we must ignore
the panel-orientation detection done by the driver.
