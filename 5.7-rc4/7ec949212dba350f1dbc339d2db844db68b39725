xfs: don't try to write a start record into every iclog

The xlog_write() function iterates over iclogs until it completes
writing all the log vectors passed in. The ticket tracks whether
a start record has been written or not, so only the first iclog gets
a start record. We only ever pass single use tickets to
xlog_write() so we only ever need to write a start record once per
xlog_write() call.

Hence we don't need to store whether we should write a start record
in the ticket as the callers provide all the information we need to
determine if a start record should be written. For the moment, we
have to ensure that we clear the XLOG_TIC_INITED appropriately so
the code in xfs_log_done() still works correctly for committing
transactions.

(darrick: Note the slight behavior change that we always deduct the
size of the op header from the ticket, even for unmount records)
