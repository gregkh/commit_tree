powerpc/numa: Remove late request for home node associativity

With commit ("powerpc/numa: Early request for home node associativity"),
commit 2ea626306810 ("powerpc/topology: Get topology for shared
processors at boot") which was requesting home node associativity
becomes redundant.

Hence remove the late request for home node associativity.
