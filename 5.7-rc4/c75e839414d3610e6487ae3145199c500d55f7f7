btrfs: kill the subvol_srcu

Now that we have proper root ref counting everywhere we can kill the
subvol_srcu.

* removal of fs_info::subvol_srcu reduces size of fs_info by 1176 bytes

* the refcount_t used for the references checks for accidental 0->1
  in cases where the root lifetime would not be properly protected

* there's a leak detector for roots to catch unfreed roots at umount
  time

* SRCU served us well over the years but is was not a proper
  synchronization mechanism for some cases
