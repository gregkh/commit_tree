btrfs: move fs_info init work into it's own helper function

open_ctree mixes initialization of fs stuff and fs_info stuff, which
makes it confusing when doing things like adding the root leak
detection.  Make a separate function that inits all the static
structures inside of the fs_info needed for the fs to operate, and then
call that before we start setting up the fs_info to be mounted.
