platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Make pmc_core_lpm_display() generic for platforms that support sub-states

Currently pmc_core_lpm_display() uses an array of the struct pointers,
i.e.  tgl_lpm_maps for Tiger Lake directly to iterate through and to get
the number of (live) status registers which is hard coded and can not
be re-used for the future platforms that support sub-states. To maintain
readability, make pmc_core_lpm_display() generic, so that it can be re-used
for future platforms.
