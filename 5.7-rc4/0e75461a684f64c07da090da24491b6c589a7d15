scsi: lpfc: Remove prototype FIPS/DSS options from SLI-3

During code review, identified dss feature that was a prototype only and
was never productized in SLI3. They shouldn't be there and prevents reuse
of the command areas.

Remove any code in the driver to deal with dss, including code to deal with
fips, which is associated with the dss feature.
