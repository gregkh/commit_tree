bpf: Add prog flag to struct bpf_ksym object

Adding 'prog' bool flag to 'struct bpf_ksym' to mark that
this object belongs to bpf_prog object.

This change allows having bpf_prog objects together with
other types (trampolines and dispatchers) in the single
bpf_tree. It's used when searching for bpf_prog exception
tables by the bpf_prog_ksym_find function, where we need
to get the bpf_prog pointer.

>From now we can safely add bpf_ksym support for trampoline
or dispatcher objects, because we can differentiate them
from bpf_prog objects.
