pinctrl: sh-pfc: gpio: Return early in gpio_pin_to_irq()

As of commit 4adeabd042422cee ("pinctrl: sh-pfc: Remove hardcoded IRQ
numbers"), only a single operation needs to be performed after finding
the wanted pin.  Hence decrease the needed attention span of the casual
reader by replacing the goto by a direct return.
