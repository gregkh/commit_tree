powerpc/powernv: Add documentation for the opal sensor_groups sysfs interfaces

Commit bf9571550f52 ("powerpc/powernv: Add support to clear sensor
groups data") added a mechanism to clear sensor-group data via a sysfs
interface. However, the ABI for that interface has not been
documented.

This patch documents the ABI for the sysfs interface for sensor-groups
and clearing the sensor-groups.
