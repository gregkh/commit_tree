drm/i915: Satisfy smatch that a loop has at least one iteration

Smatch worries that the engine->mask may be 0 leading to the loop being
shortcircuited leaving the next pointer unset,

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_active.c:667 i915_active_acquire_preallocate_barrier() error: uninitialized symbol 'next'.

Assert that mask is not 0 and smatch can then verify that next must be
initialised before use.
