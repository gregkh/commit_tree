ring-buffer: Do not die if rb_iter_peek() fails more than thrice

As the iterator will be reading a live buffer, and if the event being read
is on a page that a writer crosses, it will fail and try again, the
condition in rb_iter_peek() that only allows a retry to happen three times
is no longer valid. Allow rb_iter_peek() to retry more than three times
without killing the ring buffer, but only if rb_iter_head_event() had failed
at least once.
