x86/mce/amd: Add PPIN support for AMD MCE

Newer AMD CPUs support a feature called protected processor
identification number (PPIN). This feature can be detected via
CPUID_Fn80000008_EBX[23].

However, CPUID alone is not enough to read the processor identification
number - MSR_AMD_PPIN_CTL also needs to be configured properly. If, for
any reason, MSR_AMD_PPIN_CTL[PPIN_EN] can not be turned on, such as
disabled in BIOS, the CPU capability bit X86_FEATURE_AMD_PPIN needs to
be cleared.

When the X86_FEATURE_AMD_PPIN capability is available, the
identification number is issued together with the MCE error info in
order to keep track of the source of MCE errors.
