KVM: x86: Set kvm_x86_ops only after ->hardware_setup() completes

Set kvm_x86_ops with the vendor's ops only after ->hardware_setup()
completes to "prevent" using kvm_x86_ops before they are ready, i.e. to
generate a null pointer fault instead of silently consuming unconfigured
state.

An alternative implementation would be to have ->hardware_setup()
return the vendor's ops, but that would require non-trivial refactoring,
and would arguably result in less readable code, e.g. ->hardware_setup()
would need to use ERR_PTR() in multiple locations, and each vendor's
declaration of the runtime ops would be less obvious.

No functional change intended.
