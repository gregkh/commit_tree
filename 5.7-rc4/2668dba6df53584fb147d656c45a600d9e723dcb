misc: move FLASH_MINOR into miscdevice.h and fix conflicts

FLASH_MINOR is used in both drivers/char/nwflash.c and
drivers/sbus/char/flash.c with conflict minor numbers.

Move all the definitions of FLASH_MINOR into miscdevice.h.
Rename FLASH_MINOR for drivers/char/nwflash.c to NWFLASH_MINOR
and FLASH_MINOR for drivers/sbus/char/flash.c to SBUS_FLASH_MINOR.
