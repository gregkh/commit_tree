docs: admin-guide: merge sections for the kernel.modprobe sysctl

Documentation for the kernel.modprobe sysctl was added both by
commit 0317c5371e6a ("docs: merge debugging-modules.txt into
sysctl/kernel.rst") and by commit 6e7158250625 ("docs: admin-guide:
document the kernel.modprobe sysctl"), resulting in the same sysctl
being documented in two places.  Merge these into one place.
