power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Broaden vendor check for Intel Compute Sticks.

The Intel Compute Stick `STK1A32SC` can have a system vendor of
"Intel(R) Client Systems".
Broaden the Intel Compute Stick DMI checks so that they match "Intel
Corporation" as well as "Intel(R) Client Systems".

This fixes an issue where the STK1A32SC compute sticks were still
exposing a battery with the existing blacklist entry.
