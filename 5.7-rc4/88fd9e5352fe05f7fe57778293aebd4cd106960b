bpf: Refactor trampoline update code

As we need to introduce a third type of attachment for trampolines, the
flattened signature of arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline gets even more
complicated.

Refactor the prog and count argument to arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline to
use bpf_tramp_progs to simplify the addition and accounting for new
attachment types.
