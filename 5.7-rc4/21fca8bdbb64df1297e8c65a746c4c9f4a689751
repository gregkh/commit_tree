ASoC: dpcm: allow start or stop during pause for backend

soc_compr_trigger_fe() allows start or stop after pause_push.
In dpcm_be_dai_trigger(), however, only pause_release is allowed
command after pause_push.
So, start or stop after pause in compress offload is always
returned as error if the compress offload is used with dpcm.
To fix the problem, SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_PAUSED should be allowed
for start or stop command.
