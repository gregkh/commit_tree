efi: Clean up config_parse_tables()

config_parse_tables() is a jumble of pointer arithmetic, due to the
fact that on x86, we may be dealing with firmware whose native word
size differs from the kernel's.

This is not a concern on other architectures, and doesn't quite
justify the state of the code, so let's clean it up by adding a
non-x86 code path, constifying statically allocated tables and
replacing preprocessor conditionals with IS_ENABLED() checks.
