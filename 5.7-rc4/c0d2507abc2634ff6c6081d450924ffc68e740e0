net: thunderx: Adjust CQE_RX drop levels for better performance

With the current RX RED/DROP levels of 192/184 for CQE_RX, when
packet incoming rate is high, LLC is getting polluted resulting
in more cache misses and higher latency in packet processing. This
slows down the whole process and performance loss. Hence reduced
the levels to 224/216 (ie for a CQ size of 1024, Rx pkts will be
red dropped or dropped when unused CQE are less than 128/160 respectively)
