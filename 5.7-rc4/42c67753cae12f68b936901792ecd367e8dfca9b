ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: remove SND_SOC_SOF_HDA_COMMON_HDMI_CODEC

To help user-space with HDMI codec driver transition, both
a kernel module parameter and a kernel option were initially
provided to configure default behaviour of SOF on Intel hardware
with commit 139c7febad1a ("ASoC: SOF: Intel: add support for
snd-hda-codec-hdmi").

As hdac-hdmi is already now lagging in features compared to
snd-hda-codec-hdmi, move ahead with the transition and remove
the build option to select between the two, and instead default
to snd-hda-codec-hdmi if it is enabled in kernel build.

The old behaviour of using hdac-hdmi driver can still be forced
via the kernel module parameter.
