PCI: hv: Add support for protocol 1.3 and support PCI_BUS_RELATIONS2

Starting with Hyper-V PCI protocol version 1.3, the host VSP can send
PCI_BUS_RELATIONS2 and pass the vNUMA node information for devices on the
bus. The vNUMA node tells which guest NUMA node this device is on based
on guest VM configuration topology and physical device information.

Add code to negotiate v1.3 and process PCI_BUS_RELATIONS2.
