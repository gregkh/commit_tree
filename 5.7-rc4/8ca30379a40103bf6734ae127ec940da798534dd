bpf, sockmap: Allow inserting listening TCP sockets into sockmap

In order for sockmap/sockhash types to become generic collections for
storing TCP sockets we need to loosen the checks during map update, while
tightening the checks in redirect helpers.

Currently sock{map,hash} require the TCP socket to be in established state,
which prevents inserting listening sockets.

Change the update pre-checks so the socket can also be in listening state.

Since it doesn't make sense to redirect with sock{map,hash} to listening
sockets, add appropriate socket state checks to BPF redirect helpers too.
