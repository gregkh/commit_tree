KVM: x86: Add blurb to CPUID tracepoint when using max basic leaf values

Tack on "used max basic" at the end of the CPUID tracepoint when the
output values correspond to the max basic leaf, i.e. when emulating
Intel's out-of-range CPUID behavior.  Observing "cpuid entry not found"
in the tracepoint with non-zero output values is confusing for users
that aren't familiar with the out-of-range semantics, and qualifying the
"not found" case hopefully makes it clear that "found" means "found the
exact entry".
