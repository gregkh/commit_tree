kdb: Eliminate strncpy() warnings by replacing with strscpy()

Currently the code to manage the kdb history buffer uses strncpy() to
copy strings to/and from the history and exhibits the classic "but
nobody ever told me that strncpy() doesn't always terminate strings"
bug. Modern gcc compilers recognise this bug and issue a warning.

In reality these calls will only abridge the copied string if kdb_read()
has *already* overflowed the command buffer. Thus the use of counted
copies here is only used to reduce the secondary effects of a bug
elsewhere in the code.

Therefore transitioning these calls into strscpy() (without checking
the return code) is appropriate.
