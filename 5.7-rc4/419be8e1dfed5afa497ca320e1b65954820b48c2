i2c: stm32f7: allow controller to be wakeup-source

Allow the i2c-stm32f7 controller to become a wakeup-source
of the system. In such case, when a slave is registered to the
I2C controller, receiving a I2C message targeting that registered
slave address wakes up the suspended system.

In order to be able to wake-up, the I2C controller DT node
must have the property wakeup-source defined and a slave
must be registered.
