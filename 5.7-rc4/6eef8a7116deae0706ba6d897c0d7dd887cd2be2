perf/core: Use min_heap in visit_groups_merge()

visit_groups_merge will pick the next event based on when it was
inserted in to the context (perf_event group_index). Events may be per CPU
or for any CPU, but in the future we'd also like to have per cgroup events
to avoid searching all events for the events to schedule for a cgroup.
Introduce a min heap for the events that maintains a property that the
earliest inserted event is always at the 0th element. Initialize the heap
with per-CPU and any-CPU events for the context.
