net: dsa: Add bypass operations for the flower classifier-action filter

Due to the immense variety of classification keys and actions available
for tc-flower, as well as due to potentially very different DSA switch
capabilities, it doesn't make a lot of sense for the DSA mid layer to
even attempt to interpret these. So just pass them on to the underlying
switch driver.

DSA implements just the standard boilerplate for binding and unbinding
flow blocks to ports, since nobody wants to deal with that.
