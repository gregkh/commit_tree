kunit: add debugfs /sys/kernel/debug/kunit/<suite>/results display

add debugfs support for displaying kunit test suite results; this is
especially useful for module-loaded tests to allow disentangling of
test result display from other dmesg events.  debugfs support is
provided if CONFIG_KUNIT_DEBUGFS=y.

As well as printk()ing messages, we append them to a per-test log.
