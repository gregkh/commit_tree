efi/x86: Preserve %ebx correctly in efi_set_virtual_address_map()

Commit:

  59f2a619a2db8611 ("efi: Add 'runtime' pointer to struct efi")

modified the assembler routine called by efi_set_virtual_address_map(),
to grab the 'runtime' EFI service pointer while running with paging
disabled (which is tricky to do in C code)

After the change, register %ebx is not restored correctly, resulting
in all kinds of weird behavior, so fix that.
