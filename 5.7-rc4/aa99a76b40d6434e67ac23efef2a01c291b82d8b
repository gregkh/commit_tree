erofs: handle corrupted images whose decompressed size less than it'd be

As Lasse pointed out, "Looking at fs/erofs/decompress.c,
the return value from LZ4_decompress_safe_partial is only
checked for negative value to catch errors. ... So if
I understood it correctly, if there is bad data whose
uncompressed size is much less than it should be, it can
leave part of the output buffer untouched and expose the
previous data as the file content. "

Let's fix it now.

[ Gao Xiang: v5.3+, I will manually backport this to stable later. ]
