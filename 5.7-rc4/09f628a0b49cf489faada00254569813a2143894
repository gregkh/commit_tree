KVM: x86: Fold CPUID 0x7 masking back into __do_cpuid_func()

Move the CPUID 0x7 masking back into __do_cpuid_func() now that the
size of the code has been trimmed down significantly.

Tweak the WARN case, which is impossible to hit unless the CPU is
completely broken, to break the loop before creating the bogus entry.

Opportunustically reorder the cpuid_entry_set() calls and shorten the
comment about emulation to further reduce the footprint of CPUID 0x7.
