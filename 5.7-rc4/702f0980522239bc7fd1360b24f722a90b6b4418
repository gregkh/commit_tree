powerpc/64s/exception: Remove lite interrupt return

Regular interrupt return restores NVGPRS whereas lite returns do not.
This is clumsy: most interrupts can return without restoring NVGPRS in
most of the time, but there are special cases that require it (when
registers have been modified by the kernel). So change interrupt
return to not restore NVGPRS, and have interrupt handlers restore them
explicitly in the cases that requires it.
