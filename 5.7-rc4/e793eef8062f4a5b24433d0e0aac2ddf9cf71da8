pwm: omap-dmtimer: Do not disable PWM before changing period/duty_cycle

Only the Timer control register(TCLR) cannot be updated when the timer
is running. Registers like Counter register (TCRR), loader register
(TLDR) and match register (TMAR) can be updated while the counter is
running. Since TCLR is not updated in pwm_omap_dmtimer_config(), do not
stop the timer for period/duty_cycle update.
