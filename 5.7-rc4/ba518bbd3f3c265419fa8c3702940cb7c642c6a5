drm/i915: Force DPCD backlight mode for some Dell CML 2020 panels

According to Dell, trying to match their panels via OUI is not reliable
enough and we've been told that we should check against the EDID
instead. As well, Dell seems to have some panels that are actually
intended to switch between using PWM for backlight controls and DPCD for
backlight controls depending on whether or not the panel is in HDR or
SDR mode. Yikes.

Regardless, we need to add quirks for these so that DPCD backlight
controls get enabled by default, since without additional driver support
that's the only form of brightness control that will work. Hopefully in
the future we can remove these quirks once we have a better way of
probing for this.

Changes since v1:
* Add one more EDID per Dell's request
* Remove model number (which is possibly wrong) and replace with Dell
  CML 2020 systems
