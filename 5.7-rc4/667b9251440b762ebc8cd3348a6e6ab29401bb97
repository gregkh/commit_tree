dmaengine: uniphier-xdmac: Add UniPhier external DMA controller driver

This adds external DMA controller driver implemented in Socionext
UniPhier SoCs. This driver supports DMA_MEMCPY and DMA_SLAVE modes.

Since this driver does not support the the way to transfer size
unaligned to burst width, 'src_maxburst' or 'dst_maxburst' of
dma_slave_config must be 1 to transfer arbitrary size. If transfer
size is unaligned to burst size, the transfer isn't started and
the driver displays an error message.
