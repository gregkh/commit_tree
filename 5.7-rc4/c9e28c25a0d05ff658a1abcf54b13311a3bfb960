clk: tegra: Remove CLK_M_DIV fixed clocks

Tegra has no CLK_M_DIV2 and CLK_M_DIV4 clocks and instead it has
OSC_DIV2 and OSC_DIV4 clocks from OSC pads which are the possible
parents of PMC clocks for Tegra30 through Tegra210.

Tegra PMC clock parents are changed to use OSC_DIV clocks.

So, this patch removes CLK_M_DIV fixed clocks
