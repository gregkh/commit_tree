usb: roles: Provide the switch drivers handle to the switch in the API

The USB role callback functions had a parameter pointing to
the parent device (struct device) of the switch. The
assumption was that the switch parent is always the
controller. Firstly, that may not be true in every case, and
secondly, it prevents us from supporting devices that supply
multiple muxes.

Changing the first parameter of usb_role_switch_set_t and
usb_role_switch_get_t from struct device to struct
usb_role_switch.
