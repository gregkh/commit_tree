n_hdlc: remove checking of n_hdlc

We got rid of backup_tty recently. Also, the tty layer ensures not to
call other ldisc hooks after ldisc close. That means, all those tests
are superfluous now so remove them.

Note that we remove the magic check in write after schedule too. The tty
cannot change during schedule.
