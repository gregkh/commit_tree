f2fs: introduce DEFAULT_IO_TIMEOUT

As Geert Uytterhoeven reported:

for parameter HZ/50 in congestion_wait(BLK_RW_ASYNC, HZ/50);

On some platforms, HZ can be less than 50, then unexpected 0 timeout
jiffies will be set in congestion_wait().

This patch introduces a macro DEFAULT_IO_TIMEOUT to wrap a determinate
value with msecs_to_jiffies(20) to instead HZ/50 to avoid such issue.

Quoted from Geert Uytterhoeven:

"A timeout of HZ means 1 second.
HZ/50 means 20 ms, but has the risk of being zero, if HZ < 50.

If you want to use a timeout of 20 ms, you best use msecs_to_jiffies(20),
as that takes care of the special cases, and never returns 0."
