powerpc/Makefile: Mark phony targets as PHONY

Some of our phony targets are not marked as such. This can lead to
confusing errors, eg:

  $ make clean
  $ touch install
  $ make install
  make: 'install' is up to date.
  $

Fix it by adding them to the PHONY variable which is marked phony in
the top-level Makefile, or in scripts/Makefile.build for the boot
Makefile.
