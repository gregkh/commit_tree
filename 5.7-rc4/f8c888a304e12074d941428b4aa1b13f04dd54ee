mm/hmm: don't handle the non-fault case in hmm_vma_walk_hole_()

Setting a pfns entry to NONE before returning -EBUSY is a bug that will
cause corruption of the input flags on the next loop.

There is just a single caller using hmm_vma_walk_hole_() for the non-fault
case.  Use hmm_pfns_fill() to fill the whole pfn array with zeroes in the
only caller for the non-fault case and remove the non-fault path from
hmm_vma_walk_hole_(). This avoids setting NONE before returning -EBUSY.

Also rename the function to hmm_vma_fault() to better describe what it
does.
