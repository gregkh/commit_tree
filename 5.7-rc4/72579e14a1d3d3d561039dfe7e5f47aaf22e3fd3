net: dsa: don't fail to probe if we couldn't set the MTU

There is no reason to fail the probing of the switch if the MTU couldn't
be configured correctly (either the switch port itself, or the host
port) for whatever reason. MTU-sized traffic probably won't work, sure,
but we can still probably limp on and support some form of communication
anyway, which the users would probably appreciate more.
