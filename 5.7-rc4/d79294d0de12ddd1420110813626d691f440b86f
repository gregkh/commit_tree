i2c: designware: platdrv: Remove DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND flag on BYT and CHT

We already set DPM_FLAG_SMART_PREPARE, so we completely skip all
callbacks (other then prepare) where possible, quoting from
dw_i2c_plat_prepare():

        /*
         * If the ACPI companion device object is present for this device, it
         * may be accessed during suspend and resume of other devices via I2C
         * operation regions, so tell the PM core and middle layers to avoid
         * skipping system suspend/resume callbacks for it in that case.
         */
        return !has_acpi_companion(dev);

Also setting the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND will cause acpi_subsys_suspend()
to leave the controller runtime-suspended even if dw_i2c_plat_prepare()
returned 0.

Leaving the controller runtime-suspended normally, when the I2C controller
is suspended during the suspend_late phase, is not an issue because
the pm_runtime_get_sync() done by i2c_dw_xfer() will (runtime-)resume it.

But for dw I2C controllers on Bay- and Cherry-Trail devices acpi_lpss.c
leaves the controller alive until the suspend_noirq phase, because it may
be used by the _PS3 ACPI methods of PCI devices and PCI devices are left
powered on until the suspend_noirq phase.

Between the suspend_late and resume_early phases runtime-pm is disabled.
So for any ACPI I2C OPRegion accesses done after the suspend_late phase,
the pm_runtime_get_sync() done by i2c_dw_xfer() is a no-op and the
controller is left runtime-suspended.

i2c_dw_xfer() has a check to catch this condition (rather then waiting
for the I2C transfer to timeout because the controller is suspended).
acpi_subsys_suspend() leaving the controller runtime-suspended in
combination with an ACPI I2C OPRegion access done after the suspend_late
phase triggers this check, leading to the following error being logged
on a Bay Trail based Lenovo Thinkpad 8 tablet:

So since on BYT and CHT platforms we want ACPI I2c OPRegion accesses
to work until the suspend_noirq phase, we need the controller to be
runtime-resumed during the suspend phase if it is runtime-suspended
suspended at that time. This means that we must not set the
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND on these platforms.

On BYT and CHT we already have a special ACCESS_NO_IRQ_SUSPEND flag
to make sure the controller stays functional until the suspend_noirq
phase. This commit makes the driver not set the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND
flag when that flag is set.
