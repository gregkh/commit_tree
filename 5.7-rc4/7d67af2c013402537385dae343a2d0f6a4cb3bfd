io_uring: add splice(2) support

Add support for splice(2).

- output file is specified as sqe->fd, so it's handled by generic code
- hash_reg_file handled by generic code as well
- len is 32bit, but should be fine
- the fd_in is registered file, when SPLICE_F_FD_IN_FIXED is set, which
is a splice flag (i.e. sqe->splice_flags).
