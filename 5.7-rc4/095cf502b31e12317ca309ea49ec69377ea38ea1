binderfs: port to new mount api

When I first wrote binderfs the new mount api had not yet landed. Now
that it has been around for a little while and a bunch of filesystems
have already been ported we should do so too. When Al sent his
mount-api-conversion pr he requested that binderfs (and a few others) be
ported separately. It's time we port binderfs. We can make use of the
new option parser, get nicer infrastructure and it will be easier if we
ever add any new mount options.

This survives testing with the binderfs selftests:

for i in `seq 1 1000`; do ./binderfs_test; done

including the new stress tests I sent out for review today:
