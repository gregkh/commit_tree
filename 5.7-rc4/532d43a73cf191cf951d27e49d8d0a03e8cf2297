powerpc/irq: Use current_stack_pointer in do_IRQ()

Until commit 7306e83ccf5c ("powerpc: Don't use CURRENT_THREAD_INFO to
find the stack"), the current stack base address was obtained by
calling current_thread_info(). That inline function was simply masking
out the value of r1.

In that commit, it was changed to using current_stack_pointer() (since
renamed current_stack_frame()), which is a heavier function as it is
an outline assembly function which cannot be inlined and which reads
the content of the stack at 0(r1).

Convert to using current_stack_pointer for geting r1 and masking out
its value to obtain the base address of the stack pointer as before.
