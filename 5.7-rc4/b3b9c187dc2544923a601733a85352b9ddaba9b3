locking/lockdep: Decrement IRQ context counters when removing lock chain

There are currently three counters to track the IRQ context of a lock
chain - nr_hardirq_chains, nr_softirq_chains and nr_process_chains.
They are incremented when a new lock chain is added, but they are
not decremented when a lock chain is removed. That causes some of the
statistic counts reported by /proc/lockdep_stats to be incorrect.
IRQ
Fix that by decrementing the right counter when a lock chain is removed.

Since inc_chains() no longer accesses hardirq_context and softirq_context
directly, it is moved out from the CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS conditional
compilation block.
