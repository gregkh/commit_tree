ext4: do not commit super on read-only bdev

Under some circumstances we may encounter a filesystem error on a
read-only block device, and if we try to save the error info to the
superblock and commit it, we'll wind up with a noisy error and
backtrace, i.e.:

[ 3337.146838] EXT4-fs error (device pmem1p2): ext4_get_journal_inode:4634: comm mount: inode #0: comm mount: iget: illegal inode #
------------[ cut here ]------------
generic_make_request: Trying to write to read-only block-device pmem1p2 (partno 2)
WARNING: CPU: 107 PID: 115347 at block/blk-core.c:788 generic_make_request_checks+0x6b4/0x7d0
...

To avoid this, commit the error info in the superblock only if the
block device is writable.
