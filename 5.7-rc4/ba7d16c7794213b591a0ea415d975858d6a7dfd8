devlink: Implicitly set auto recover flag when registering health reporter

When health reporter is registered to devlink, devlink will implicitly set
auto recover if and only if the reporter has a recover method. No reason
to explicitly get the auto recover flag from the driver.

Remove this flag from all drivers that called
devlink_health_reporter_create.

All existing health reporters set auto recovery to true if they have a
recover method.

Yet, administrator can unset auto recover via netlink command as prior to
this patch.
