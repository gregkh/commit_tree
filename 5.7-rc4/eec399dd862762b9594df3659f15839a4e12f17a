x86/vdso: Move VDSO clocksource state tracking to callback

All architectures which use the generic VDSO code have their own storage
for the VDSO clock mode. That's pointless and just requires duplicate code.

X86 abuses the function which retrieves the architecture specific clock
mode storage to mark the clocksource as used in the VDSO. That's silly
because this is invoked on every tick when the VDSO data is updated.

Move this functionality to the clocksource::enable() callback so it gets
invoked once when the clocksource is installed. This allows to make the
clock mode storage generic.
