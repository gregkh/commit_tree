firmware: arm_scmi: Make scmi core independent of the transport type

The SCMI specification is fairly independent of the transport protocol,
which can be a simple mailbox (already implemented) or anything else.
The current Linux implementation however is very much dependent on the
mailbox transport layer.

This patch makes the SCMI core code (driver.c) independent of the
mailbox transport layer and moves all mailbox related code to a new
file: mailbox.c and all struct shared_mem related code to a new file:
shmem.c.

We can now implement more transport protocols to transport SCMI
messages.

The transport protocols just need to provide struct scmi_transport_ops,
with its version of the callbacks to enable exchange of SCMI messages.
