arm64: unwind: strip PAC from kernel addresses

When we enable pointer authentication in the kernel, LR values saved to
the stack will have a PAC which we must strip in order to retrieve the
real return address.

Strip PACs when unwinding the stack in order to account for this.

When function graph tracer is used with patchable-function-entry then
return_to_handler will also have pac bits so strip it too.
