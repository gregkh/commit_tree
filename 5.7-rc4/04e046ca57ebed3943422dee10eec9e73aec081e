PCI: endpoint: Fix for concurrent memory allocation in OB address region

pci-epc-mem uses a bitmap to manage the Endpoint outbound (OB) address
region. This address region will be shared by multiple endpoint
functions (in the case of multi function endpoint) and it has to be
protected from concurrent access to avoid updating an inconsistent state.

Use a mutex to protect bitmap updates to prevent the memory
allocation API from returning incorrect addresses.
