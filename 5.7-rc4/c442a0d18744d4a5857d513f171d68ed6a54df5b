driver core: Set fw_devlink to "permissive" behavior by default

Set fw_devlink to "permissive" behavior by default so that device links
are automatically created (with DL_FLAG_SYNC_STATE_ONLY) by scanning the
firmware.

This ensures suppliers get their sync_state() calls only after all their
consumers have probed successfully. Without this, suppliers will get
their sync_state() calls at late_initcall_sync() even if their consuer

Ideally, we'd want to set fw_devlink to "on" or "rpm" by default. But
that needs more testing as it's known to break some corner case
drivers/platforms.
