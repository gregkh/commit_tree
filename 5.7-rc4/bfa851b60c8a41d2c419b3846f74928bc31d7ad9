clk: mmp2: add the GPU clocks

MMP2 has a single GC860 core while MMP3 has a GC2000 and a GC300.
On both platforms there's an AXI bus interface clock that's common for
all GPUs and each GPU core has a separate clock.

Meaning of the relevant APMU_GPU bits were gotten from James Cameron's
message and [1], the OLPC OS kernel source [2] and Marvell's MMP3 tree.
