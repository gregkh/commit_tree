mac80211_hwsim: enable Beacon protection

Now that there is support for BIGTK configuration and AP/STA
functionality for using BIP with Beacon frames, indicate support for the
Beacon protection functionality.

Johannes: move this to hwsim, since it's not clear that all drivers
using mac80211 will do this correctly - lots of them modify the
beacon before transmission e.g. to update the TIM element, and that
would obviously break the signature.
