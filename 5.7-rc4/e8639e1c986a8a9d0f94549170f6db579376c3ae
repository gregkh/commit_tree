bus: ti-sysc: Handle module unlock quirk needed for some RTC

The RTC modules on am3 and am4 need quirk handling to unlock and lock
them for reset so let's add the quirk handling based on what we already
have for legacy platform data. In later patches we will simply drop the
RTC related platform data and the old quirk handling.
