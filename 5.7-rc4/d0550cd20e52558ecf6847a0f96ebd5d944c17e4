usb: dwc3: gadget: Do link recovery for SS and SSP

The controller always supports link recovery for device in SS and SSP.
Remove the speed limit check. Also, when the device is in RESUME or
RESET state, it means the controller received the resume/reset request.
The driver must send the link recovery to acknowledge the request. They
are valid states for the driver to send link recovery.
