kdb: Censor attempts to set PROMPT without ENABLE_MEM_READ

Currently the PROMPT variable could be abused to provoke the printf()
machinery to read outside the current stack frame. Normally this
doesn't matter becaues md is already a much better tool for reading
from memory.

However the md command can be disabled by not setting KDB_ENABLE_MEM_READ.
Let's also prevent PROMPT from being modified in these circumstances.

Whilst adding a comment to help future code reviewers we also remove
the #ifdef where PROMPT in consumed. There is no problem passing an
unused (0) to snprintf when !CONFIG_SMP.
