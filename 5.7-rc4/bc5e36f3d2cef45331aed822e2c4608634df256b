OMAP: DSS2: remove non-zero check on variable r

Variable r is being initialized to zero, so the check of a non-zero
rv is redundant and can be removed.

It appears that the previous case statements set r to be -EINVAL
and the "Fallthrough" comment afterwards suggested it was going
to fall through to this non-zero check but won't because of the
break statement. Remove the confusion by removing the Fallthrough
comment too.
