KVM: x86: Allocate memslot resources during prepare_memory_region()

Allocate the various metadata structures associated with a new memslot
during kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region(), which paves the way for
removing kvm_arch_create_memslot() altogether.  Moving x86's memory
allocation only changes the order of kernel memory allocations between
x86 and common KVM code.
