f2fs: don't trigger data flush in foreground operation

Data flush can generate heavy IO and cause long latency during
flush, so it's not appropriate to trigger it in foreground
operation.

And also, we may face below potential deadlock during data flush:
- f2fs_write_multi_pages
 - f2fs_write_raw_pages
  - f2fs_write_single_data_page
   - f2fs_balance_fs
    - f2fs_balance_fs_bg
     - f2fs_sync_dirty_inodes
      - filemap_fdatawrite   -- stuck on flush same cluster
