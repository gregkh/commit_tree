drm: Avoid drm_global_mutex for simple inc/dec of dev->open_count

Since drm_global_mutex is a true global mutex across devices, we don't
want to acquire it unless absolutely necessary. For maintaining the
device local open_count, we can use atomic operations on the counter
itself, except when making the transition to/from 0. Here, we tackle the
easy portion of delaying acquiring the drm_global_mutex for the final
release by using atomic_dec_and_mutex_lock(), leaving the global
serialisation across the device opens.
