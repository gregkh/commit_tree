efi/libstub: Use hidden visibility for all source files

Instead of setting the visibility pragma for a small set of symbol
declarations that could result in absolute references that we cannot
support in the stub, declare hidden visibility for all code in the
EFI stub, which is more robust and future proof.

To ensure that the #pragma is taken into account before any other
includes are processed, put it in a header file of its own and
include it via the compiler command line using the -include option.
