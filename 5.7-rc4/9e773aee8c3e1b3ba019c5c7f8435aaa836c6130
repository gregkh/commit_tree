iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Batch ATC invalidation commands

Similar to commit 2af2e72b18b4 ("iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Defer TLB
invalidation until ->iotlb_sync()"), build up a list of ATC invalidation
commands and submit them all at once to the command queue instead of
one-by-one.

As there is only one caller of arm_smmu_atc_inv_master() left, we can
simplify it and avoid passing in struct arm_smmu_cmdq_ent.
