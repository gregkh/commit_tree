brcmfmac: add USB autosuspend feature support

We add enable dynamic suspend (autosuspend) support in host driver, and
it can let platform cut down idle power consumption.
To support autosuspend feature in host driver, kernel need to be built
with CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND and autosuspend need to be turn on.
And we also replace wowl feature with adding "needs_remote_wakeup", so
that host still can be waken by wireless device.
