netdevsim: Add devlink-trap policer support

Register three dummy packet trap policers with devlink and implement
callbacks to change their parameters and read their counters.

This will be used later on in the series to test the devlink-trap
policer infrastructure.

v2:
* Remove check about burst size being a power of 2 and instead add a
  debugfs knob to fail the operation
* Provide max/min rate/burst size when registering policers and remove
  the validity checks from nsim_dev_devlink_trap_policer_set()
