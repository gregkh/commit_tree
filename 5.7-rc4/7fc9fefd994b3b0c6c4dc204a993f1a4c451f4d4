tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Improve CLX commands

CLX doesn't have capability to change the feature in the hardware, but
this acts as "--auto | -a" option. So even if user didn't specify the
option, use this as --auto | -a to set cpufreq scaling frequency limits.

Also remove perror with debug_printf as they don't bring any value.
