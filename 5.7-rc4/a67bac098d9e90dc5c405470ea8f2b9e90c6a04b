MIPS: CI20: defconfig: multiple improvements

a) configure for supporting modules

Not all drivers need to be compiled into the kernel.
Support building and loading of kernel modules.

b) compile leds-gpio driver into the kernel and configure for LED triggers

DTS has been augmented to add some gpio-leds. We need the leds-gpio driver
and enable the triggers.

c) configure CONFIG_REGULATOR_ACT8865 for PMU

The PMU on the CI20 board is an ACT8600 using the ACT8865 driver.
Since it is not compiled, the PMU and the CI20 board is running in
power-on reset state of the PMU.

d) compile gpio-ir driver

The CI20 board has a gpio based IR receiver.

e) configure for CONFIG_KEYBOARD_GPIO=m

The SW1 button is hooked up to send input events.
