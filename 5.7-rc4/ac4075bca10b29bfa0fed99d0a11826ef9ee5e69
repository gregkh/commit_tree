m68k: Drop redundant generic-y += hardirq.h

The cleanup in commit 630f289b7114c0e6 ("asm-generic: make more
kernel-space headers mandatory") did not take into account the recently
added line for hardirq.h in commit acc45648b9aefa90 ("m68k: Switch to
asm-generic/hardirq.h"), leading to the following message during the
build:

    scripts/Makefile.asm-generic:25: redundant generic-y found in arch/m68k/include/asm/Kbuild: hardirq.h

Fix this by dropping the now redundant line.
