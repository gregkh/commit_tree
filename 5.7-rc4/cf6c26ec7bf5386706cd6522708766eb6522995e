KVM: x86: Code style cleanup in kvm_arch_dev_ioctl()

In kvm_arch_dev_ioctl(), the brackets of case KVM_X86_GET_MCE_CAP_SUPPORTED
accidently encapsulates case KVM_GET_MSR_FEATURE_INDEX_LIST and case
KVM_GET_MSRS. It doesn't affect functionality but it's misleading.

Remove unnecessary brackets and opportunistically add a "break" in the
default path.
