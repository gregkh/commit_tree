fanotify: Drop fanotify_event_has_fid()

When some events have directory id and some object id,
fanotify_event_has_fid() becomes mostly useless and confusing because we
usually need to know which type of file handle the event has. So just
drop the function and use fanotify_event_object_fh() instead.
