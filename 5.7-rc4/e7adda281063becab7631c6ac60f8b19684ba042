KVM: x86: Add requested index to the CPUID tracepoint

Output the requested index when tracing CPUID emulation; it's basically
mandatory for leafs where the index is meaningful, and is helpful for
verifying KVM correctness even when the index isn't meaningful, e.g. the
trace for a Linux guest's hypervisor_cpuid_base() probing appears to
be broken (returns all zeroes) at first glance, but is correct because
the index is non-zero, i.e. the output values correspond to a random
index in the maximum basic leaf.
