ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Remove superfluous chip initialization

Skylake driver does the controller init operation twice:
- first during probe (only to stop it just before scheduling probe_work)
- and during said probe_work where the actual correct sequence is
executed

To properly complete boot sequence when iDisp codec is present, bus
initialization has to be called only after _i915_init() finishes.
With additional _reset_list preceding _i915_init(), iDisp codec never
gets the chance to enumerate on the link. Remove the superfluous
initialization to address the issue.
