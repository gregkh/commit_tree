mlxsw: Fix some IS_ERR() vs NULL bugs

The mlxsw_sp_acl_rulei_create() function is supposed to return an error
pointer from mlxsw_afa_block_create().  The problem is that these
functions both return NULL instead of error pointers.  Half the callers
expect NULL and half expect error pointers so it could lead to a NULL
dereference on failure.

This patch changes both of them to return error pointers and changes all
the callers which checked for NULL to check for IS_ERR() instead.
