bpf: Remove bpf_image tree

Now that we have all the objects (bpf_prog, bpf_trampoline,
bpf_dispatcher) linked in bpf_tree, there's no need to have
separate bpf_image tree for images.

Reverting the bpf_image tree together with struct bpf_image,
because it's no longer needed.

Also removing bpf_image_alloc function and adding the original
bpf_jit_alloc_exec_page interface instead.

The kernel_text_address function can now rely only on is_bpf_text_address,
because it checks the bpf_tree that contains all the objects.

Keeping bpf_image_ksym_add and bpf_image_ksym_del because they are
useful wrappers with perf's ksymbol interface calls.
