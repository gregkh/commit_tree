sched/fair: Fix negative imbalance in imbalance calculation

A negative imbalance value was observed after imbalance calculation,
this happens when the local sched group type is group_fully_busy,
and the average load of local group is greater than the selected
busiest group. Fix this problem by comparing the average load of the
local and busiest group before imbalance calculation formula.
