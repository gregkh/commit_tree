scsi: aacraid: use scsi_host_(block,unblock) to block I/O

Use scsi_host_block() and scsi_host_unblock() instead of
scsi_block_requests()/scsi_unblock_requests() to block and unblock I/O.
This has the advantage that the block layer will stop sending I/O to the
adapter instead of having the SCSI midlayer requeueing I/O internally.
