regulator: driver.h: fix regulator_map_* function names

The toolchain produces a warning on this driver when building
the docs:

	./include/linux/regulator/driver.h:284: WARNING: Unknown target name: "regulator_regmap_x_voltage".

While fixing it, we notices that there's no function names
with the above pattern. It seems that some previous patch
renamed it to regulator_map_* instead.

So, change the function name, replacing "x" by "*", with is
a more used way to add a wildcard, and escape those with
``literal`` markup, in order to avoid the toolchain to think
that this is a link to some existing document chapter.
