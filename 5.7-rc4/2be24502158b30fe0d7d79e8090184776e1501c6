fbcon: Adjust indentation in set_con2fb_map

Clang warns:

../drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:915:3: warning: misleading
indentation; statement is not part of the previous 'if'
[-Wmisleading-indentation]
        return err;
        ^
../drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:912:2: note: previous statement is
here
        if (!search_fb_in_map(info_idx))
        ^
1 warning generated.

This warning occurs because there is a space before the tab on this
line. This happens on several lines in this function; normalize them
so that the indentation is consistent with the Linux kernel coding
style and clang no longer warns.

This warning was introduced before the beginning of git history so no
fixes tab.
