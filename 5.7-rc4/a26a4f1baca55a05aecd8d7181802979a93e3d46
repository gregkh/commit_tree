mmc: sdhci-esdhci-imx: retune needed for Mega/Mix enabled SoCs

For Mega/Mix enabled SoCs like MX7D and MX6SX, uSDHC will lost power in
LP mode no matter whether the MMC_KEEP_POWER flag is set or not.
This may cause state misalign between kernel and HW, especially for
SDIO3.0 WiFi cards.
e.g. SDIO WiFi driver usually will keep power during system suspend.
And after resume, no card re-enumeration called.
But the tuning state is lost due to Mega/Mix.
Then CRC error may happen during next data transfer.

So we should always fire a mmc_retune_needed() for such type SoC
to tell MMC core retuning is needed for next data transfer.
