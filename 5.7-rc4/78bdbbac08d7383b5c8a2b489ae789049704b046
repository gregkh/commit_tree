MIPS: do not compile generic functions for CONFIG_CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC

MIPS provides multiple definitions for the following functions:

  fw_init_cmdline
  __delay
  __udelay
  __ndelay
  memmove
  __rmemcpy
  memcpy
  __copy_user

The generic ones are defined in lib-y objects, which are overridden by
the Octeon ones when CONFIG_CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC is enabled.

The use of EXPORT_SYMBOL in static libraries potentially causes a
problem for the llvm linker [1]. So, I want to forcibly link lib-y
objects to vmlinux when CONFIG_MODULES=y.

As a groundwork, we must fix multiple definitions that have previously
been hidden by lib-y.

If you look at lib/string.c, arch can define __HAVE_ARCH_* to opt out
the generic implementation.

Similarly, this commit adds CONFIG_HAVE_PLAT_* to allow a platform
to opt out the MIPS generic code.
