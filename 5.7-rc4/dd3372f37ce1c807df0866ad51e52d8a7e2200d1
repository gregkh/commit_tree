arm64: defconfig: Enable NXP/FSL SPI controller drivers

Enables SPI controller drivers used in various NXP/FSL SoCs.

QSPI is fast enough to connect big flash for file system.  It is used to
connect 512MB NAND flash and 256MB NOR flash on LS1028RDB.  It is used
as bootsource for other platforms like LS2080ardb too. Enabled as
built-in to load RFS from SPI flash without requiring initramfs.
