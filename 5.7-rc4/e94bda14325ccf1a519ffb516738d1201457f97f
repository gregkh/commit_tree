drm/i915/tgl: Add Wa_1608008084

Wa_1608008084 is an additional WA that applies to writes on FF_MODE2
register. We can't read it back either from CPU or GPU. Since the other
bits should be 0, recommendation to handle Wa_1604555607 is to actually
just write the timer value.

Do a write only and don't try to read it, neither before or after
the WA is applied.
