soc/tegra: pmc: Add pins for Tegra194

Extend the Tegra194 IO pad table with additional information such as pin
names and 1.8/3.3 V settings to allow a table of voltage control pins to
generated from it. This is similar to what's done for older chips and is
needed to support high-speed modes for SDHCI where switching the pins to
1.8V or 3.3V is necessary.
