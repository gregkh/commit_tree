ext4: clean up error return for convert_initialized_extent()

Although convert_initialized_extent() can potentially return an error
code with a negative value, its returned value is assigned to an
unsigned variable containing a block count in ext4_ext_map_blocks() and
then returned to that function's caller. The code currently works,
though the way this happens is obscure.  The code would be more
readable if it followed the error handling convention used elsewhere
in ext4_ext_map_blocks().

This patch does not address any known test failure or bug report - it's
simply a cleanup.  It also addresses a nearby coding standard issue.
