thermal/cpu-cooling, sched/core: Move the arch_set_thermal_pressure() API to generic scheduler code

drivers/base/arch_topology.c is only built if CONFIG_GENERIC_ARCH_TOPOLOGY=y,
resulting in such build failures:

  cpufreq_cooling.c:(.text+0x1e7): undefined reference to `arch_set_thermal_pressure'

Move it to sched/core.c instead, and keep it enabled on x86 despite
us not having a arch_scale_thermal_pressure() facility there, to
build-test this thing.
