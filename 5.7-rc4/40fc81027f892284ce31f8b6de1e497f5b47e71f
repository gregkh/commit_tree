afs: Fix afs_d_validate() to set the right directory version

If a dentry's version is somewhere between invalid_before and the current
directory version, we should be setting it forward to the current version,
not backwards to the invalid_before version.  Note that we're only doing
this at all because dentry::d_fsdata isn't large enough on a 32-bit system.

Fix this by using a separate variable for invalid_before so that we don't
accidentally clobber the current dir version.
