clocksource: Add common vdso clock mode storage

All architectures which use the generic VDSO code have their own storage
for the VDSO clock mode. That's pointless and just requires duplicate code.

Provide generic storage for it. The new Kconfig symbol is intermediate and
will be removed once all architectures are converted over.
