bus: ti-sysc: Detect EDMA and set quirk flags for tptc

In order to probe EDMA with ti-sysc interconnect target module and with
device tree data, we need to properly detect EDMA and set the flags for
SYSC_QUIRK_SWSUP_SIDLE | SYSC_QUIRK_SWSUP_MSTANDBY for tptc.

We have these flags currently set for am4 and dra7, but not for am335x.
Let's set them for all the SoCs as the tptc module should behave the
same for all of them. It's likely that am335x was never tested to idle
EDMA tptc.
