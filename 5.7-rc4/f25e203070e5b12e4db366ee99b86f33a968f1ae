ASoC: Intel: bdw-rt5650: Revert SSP0 link to use dummy components

Recent series of patches targeting broadwell boards, while enabling
SOF, changed behavior for non-SOF solutions. In essence replacing
platform 'dummy' with actual 'platform' causes redundant stream
initialization to occur during audio start. hw_params for haswell-pcm
destroys initial stream right after its creation - only to recreate it
again from proceed from there.

While harmless so far, this flow isn't right and should be corrected.
The actual need for dummy components for SSP0 link is questionable but
that issue is subject for another series.
