ceph: switch to page_mkwrite_check_truncate in ceph_page_mkwrite

Use the "page has been truncated" logic in page_mkwrite_check_truncate
instead of reimplementing it here.  Other than with the existing code,
fail with -EFAULT / VM_FAULT_NOPAGE when page_offset(page) == size here
as well, as should be expected.
