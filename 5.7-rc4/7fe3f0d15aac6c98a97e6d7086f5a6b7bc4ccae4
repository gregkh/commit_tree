drm: Add get_vblank_timestamp() to struct drm_crtc_funcs

The callback get_vblank_timestamp() is currently located in struct
drm_driver, but really belongs into struct drm_crtc_funcs. Add an
equivalent there. Driver will be converted in separate patches.

The default implementation is drm_calc_vbltimestamp_from_scanoutpos().
The patch adds drm_crtc_vblank_helper_get_vblank_timestamp(), which is
an implementation for the CRTC callback.

v4:
	* more readable code for setting high_prec (Ville, Jani)
v3:
	* use refactored timestamp calculation to minimize duplicated code
	* do more checks for crtc != NULL to support legacy drivers
v2:
	* rename helper to drm_crtc_vblank_helper_get_vblank_timestamp()
	* replace drm_calc_vbltimestamp_from_scanoutpos() with
	  drm_crtc_vblank_helper_get_vblank_timestamp() in docs
