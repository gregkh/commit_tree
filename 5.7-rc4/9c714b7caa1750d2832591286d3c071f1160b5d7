rtw88: 8822c: modify rf protection setting

According to some experiments, the original RF register protection
setting of 8822c cannot perfectly make sure that there is no hardware
PI write (direct) during direct write. Modify the setting so that the
hardware block of PI would be turned off via rtw8822c_rstb_3wire()
during the direct write, to avoid RF register racing.

Note that 8822b uses SIPI write (indirect), so 8822b does not
have such problem.
