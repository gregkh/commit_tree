cpu/hotplug: Create a new function to shutdown nonboot cpus

This function will be used later in machine_shutdown() for some
architectures.

disable_nonboot_cpus() is not safe to use when doing machine_down(),
because it relies on freeze_secondary_cpus() which in turn is a
suspend/resume related freeze and could abort if the logic detects any
pending activities that can prevent finishing the offlining process.
