docs: cgroup-v1: Document the cpuset_v2_mode mount option

The cpuset in cgroup v1 accepts a special "cpuset_v2_mode" mount
option that make cpuset.cpus and cpuset.mems behave more like those in
cgroup v2.  Document it to make other people more aware of this feature
that can be useful in some circumstances.
