efi/arm: Rewrite FDT param discovery routines

The efi_get_fdt_params() routine uses the early OF device tree
traversal helpers, that iterate over each node in the DT and invoke
a caller provided callback that can inspect the node's contents and
look for the required data. This requires a special param struct to
be passed around, with pointers into param enumeration structs that
contain (and duplicate) property names and offsets into yet another
struct that carries the collected data.

Since we know the data we look for is either under /hypervisor/uefi
or under /chosen, it is much simpler to use the libfdt routines, and
just try to grab a reference to either node directly, and read each
property in sequence.
