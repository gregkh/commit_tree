KVM: x86: Move CPUID 0xD.1 handling out of the index>0 loop

Mov the sub-leaf 1 handling for CPUID 0xD out of the index>0 loop so
that the loop only handles index>2.  Sub-leafs 2+ have identical
semantics, whereas sub-leaf 1 is effectively a feature sub-leaf.

Moving sub-leaf 1 out of the loop does duplicate a bit of code, but
the nent/maxnent code will be consolidated in a future patch, and
duplicating the clear of ECX/EDX is arguably a good thing as the reasons
for clearing said registers are completely different.

No functional change intended.
