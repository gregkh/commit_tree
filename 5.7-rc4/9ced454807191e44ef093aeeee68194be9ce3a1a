rcu: Add missing annotation for rcu_nocb_bypass_lock()

Sparse reports warning at rcu_nocb_bypass_lock()

|warning: context imbalance in rcu_nocb_bypass_lock() - wrong count at exit

To fix this, this commit adds an __acquires(&rdp->nocb_bypass_lock).
Given that rcu_nocb_bypass_lock() does actually call raw_spin_lock()
when raw_spin_trylock() fails, this not only fixes the warning but also
improves on the readability of the code.
