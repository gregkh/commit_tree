efi/libstub/arm64: Avoid image_base value from efi_loaded_image

Commit:

  9f9223778ef3 ("efi/libstub/arm: Make efi_entry() an ordinary PE/COFF entrypoint")

did some code refactoring to get rid of the EFI entry point assembler
code, and in the process, it got rid of the assignment of image_addr
to the value of _text. Instead, it switched to using the image_base
field of the efi_loaded_image struct provided by UEFI, which should
contain the same value.

However, Michael reports that this is not the case: older GRUB builds
corrupt this value in some way, and since we can easily switch back to
referring to _text to discover this value, let's simply do that.

While at it, fix another issue in commit 9f9223778ef3, which may result
in the unassigned image_addr to be misidentified as the preferred load
offset of the kernel, which is unlikely but will cause a boot crash if
it does occur.

Finally, let's add a warning if the _text vs. image_base discrepancy is
detected, so we can tell more easily how widespread this issue actually
is.
