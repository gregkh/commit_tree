perf map: Use strstarts() to look for Android libraries

And add the '/' to avoid looking at things like "/system/libsomething",
when all we want to know if it is like "/system/lib/something", i.e. if
it is in that system library dir.

Using strstarts() avoids off-by-one errors like recently fixed in this
file.

Since this adds the '/' I separated this patch, another patch will make
this consistent by removing other strncmp(str, prefix, manually
calculated prefix length) usage.
