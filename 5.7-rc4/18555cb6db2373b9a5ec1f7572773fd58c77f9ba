Revert "driver core: Set fw_devlink to "permissive" behavior by default"

This reverts commit c442a0d18744d4a5857d513f171d68ed6a54df5b as it
breaks some of the Raspberry Pi devices.  Marek writes:
	This patch has just landed in linux-next 20200326. Sadly it
	breaks booting of the Raspberry Pi3b and Pi4 boards, either in
	32bit or 64bit mode. There is no warning nor panic message, just
	a silent freeze. The last message shown on the earlycon is:

	[    0.893217] Serial: 8250/16550 driver, 1 ports, IRQ sharing enabled

so revert it for now and let's try again and add it to linux-next after
5.7-rc1 is out so that we can try to get more debugging/testing
happening.
