PCI: endpoint: Assign function number for each PF in EPC core

The PCIe endpoint core relies on the drivers that invoke the
pci_epc_add_epf() API to allocate and assign a function number
to each physical function (PF). Since endpoint function device can
be created by multiple mechanisms (configfs, devicetree, etc..),
allowing each of these mechanisms to assign a function number
would result in mutliple endpoint function devices having the
same function number. In order to avoid this, let EPC core assign
a function number to the endpoint device.
