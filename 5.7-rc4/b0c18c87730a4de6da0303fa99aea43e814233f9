rcu: Add WRITE_ONCE to rcu_node ->exp_seq_rq store

The rcu_node structure's ->exp_seq_rq field is read locklessly, so
this commit adds the WRITE_ONCE() to a load in order to provide proper
documentation and READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() pairing.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely.
