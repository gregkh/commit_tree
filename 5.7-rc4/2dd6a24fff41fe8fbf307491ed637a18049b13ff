wimax: remove some redundant assignments to variable result

In function i2400m_bm_buf_alloc there is no need to use a variable
'result' to return -ENOMEM, just return the literal value. In the
function i2400m_setup the variable 'result' is initialized with a
value that is never read, it is a redundant assignment that can
be removed.
