btrfs: relocation: Add introduction of how relocation works

Relocation is one of the most complex part of btrfs, while it's also the
foundation stone for online resizing, profile converting.

For such a complex facility, we should at least have some introduction
to it.

This patch will add an basic introduction at pretty a high level,
explaining:

- What relocation does
- How relocation is done
  Only mentioning how data reloc tree and reloc tree are involved in the
  operation.
  No details like the backref cache, or the data reloc tree contents.
- Which function to refer.

More detailed comments will be added for reloc tree creation, data reloc
tree creation and backref cache.
