platform/chrome: cros_ec: Query EC protocol version if EC transitions between RO/RW

RO and RW of EC may have different EC protocol version. If EC transitions
between RO and RW, but AP does not reboot (this is true for fingerprint
microcontroller / cros_fp, but not true for main ec / cros_ec), the AP
still uses the protocol version queried before transition, which can
cause problems. In the case of fingerprint microcontroller, this causes
AP to send the wrong version of EC_CMD_GET_NEXT_EVENT to RO in the
interrupt handler, which in turn prevents RO to clear the interrupt
line to AP, in an infinite loop.

Once an EC_HOST_EVENT_INTERFACE_READY is received, we know that there
might have been a transition between RO and RW, so re-query the protocol.
