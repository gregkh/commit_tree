bpf: Document bpf_inspect drgn tool

It's a follow-up for discussion in [1].

drgn tool bpf_inspect.py was merged to drgn repo in [2]. Document it
in kernel tree to make BPF developers aware that the tool exists and
can help with getting BPF state unavailable via UAPI.

For now it's just one tool but the doc is written in a way that allows
to cover more tools in the future if needed.

Please refer to the doc itself for more details.

The patch was tested by `make htmldocs` and sanity-checking that
resulting html looks good.

v2 -> v3:
  - two sections: "Description" and "Getting started" (Daniel);
  - add examples in "Getting started" section (Daniel);
  - add "Customization" section to show how tool can be customized.

v1 -> v2:
  - better "BPF drgn tools" section (Alexei)
