riscv: fix vdso build with lld

When building with the LLVM linker this error occurrs:
    LD      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.o
  ld.lld: error: no input files

This happens because the lld treats -R as an alias to -rpath, as opposed
to ld where -R means --just-symbols.

Use the long option name for compatibility between the two.
