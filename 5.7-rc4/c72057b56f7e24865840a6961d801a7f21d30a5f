afs: Fix missing XDR advance in xdr_decode_{AFS,YFS}FSFetchStatus()

If we receive a status record that has VNOVNODE set in the abort field,
xdr_decode_AFSFetchStatus() and xdr_decode_YFSFetchStatus() don't advance
the XDR pointer, thereby corrupting anything subsequent decodes from the
same block of data.

This has the potential to affect AFS.InlineBulkStatus and
YFS.InlineBulkStatus operation, but probably doesn't since the status
records are extracted as individual blocks of data and the buffer pointer
is reset between blocks.

It does affect YFS.RemoveFile2 operation, corrupting the volsync record -
though that is not currently used.

Other operations abort the entire operation rather than returning an error
inline, in which case there is no decoding to be done.

Fix this by unconditionally advancing the xdr pointer.
