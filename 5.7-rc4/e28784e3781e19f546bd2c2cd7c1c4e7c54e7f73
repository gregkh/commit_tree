bpf: Factor out attach_type to prog_type mapping for attach/detach

Factor out logic mapping expected program attach type to program type and
subsequent handling of program attach/detach. Also list out all supported
cgroup BPF program types explicitly to prevent accidental bugs once more
program types are added to a mapping. Do the same for prog_query API.
