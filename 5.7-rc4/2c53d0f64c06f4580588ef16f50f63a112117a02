vdpasim: vDPA device simulator

This patch implements a software vDPA networking device. The datapath
is implemented through vringh and workqueue. The device has an on-chip
IOMMU which translates IOVA to PA. For kernel virtio drivers, vDPA
simulator driver provides dma_ops. For vhost driers, set_map() methods
of vdpa_config_ops is implemented to accept mappings from vhost.

Currently, vDPA device simulator will loopback TX traffic to RX. So
the main use case for the device is vDPA feature testing, prototyping
and development.

Note, there's no management API implemented, a vDPA device will be
registered once the module is probed. We need to handle this in the
future development.
