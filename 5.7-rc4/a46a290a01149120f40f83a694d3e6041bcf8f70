efi/libstub: Use consistent type names for file I/O protocols

Align the naming of efi_file_io_interface_t and efi_file_handle_t with
the UEFI spec, and call them efi_simple_file_system_protocol_t and
efi_file_protocol_t, respectively, using the same convention we use
for all other type definitions that originate in the UEFI spec.

While at it, move the definitions to efistub.h, so they are only seen
by code that needs them.
