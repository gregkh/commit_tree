drm/sun4i: dsi: Use NULL to signify "no panel"

The continued use of an ERR_PTR to signify "no panel" outside of
sun6i_dsi_attach is confusing because it is a double negative. Because
the connector always reports itself as connected, there is also the
possibility of sending an ERR_PTR to drm_panel_get_modes(), which would
crash.

Solve both of these by only storing the panel pointer if it is valid.
