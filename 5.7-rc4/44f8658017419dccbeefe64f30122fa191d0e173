sched: act: allow user to specify type of HW stats for a filter

Currently, user who is adding an action expects HW to report stats,
however it does not have exact expectations about the stats types.
That is aligned with TCA_ACT_HW_STATS_TYPE_ANY.

Allow user to specify the type of HW stats for an action and require it.

Pass the information down to flow_offload layer.
