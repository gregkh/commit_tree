soundwire: bus: fix race condition with enumeration_complete signaling

This patch adds the signaling needed for Slave drivers to wait until
the enumeration completes so that race conditions when issuing
read/write commands are avoided. The calls for wait_for_completion()
will be added in codec drivers in follow-up patches.

The order between init_completion() and complete() is deterministic,
the Slave is marked as UNATTACHED either during a Master-initiated
HardReset, or when the hardware detects the Slave no longer reports as
ATTACHED.
