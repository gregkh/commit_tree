mtd: spinand: toshiba: Rename function name to change suffix and prefix (8Gbit)

The suffix was changed from "G" to "J" to classify between 1st generation
and 2nd generation serial NAND devices (which now belong to the Kioxia
brand).
As reference that's
1st generation device of 1Gbit product is "TC58CVG0S3HRAIG"
2nd generation device of 1Gbit product is "TC58CVG0S3HRAIJ".

The 8Gbit type "TH58CxG3S0HRAIJ" is new to Kioxia's serial NAND lineup and
the prefix was changed from "TC58" to "TH58".

Thus the functions were renamed from tc58cxgxsx_*() to tx58cxgxsxraix_*().
