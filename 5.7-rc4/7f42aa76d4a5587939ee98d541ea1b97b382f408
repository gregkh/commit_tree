KVM: x86/mmu: Consolidate open coded variants of memslot TLB flushes

Replace open coded instances of kvm_arch_flush_remote_tlbs_memslot()'s
functionality with calls to the aforementioned function.  Update the
comment in kvm_arch_flush_remote_tlbs_memslot() to elaborate on how it
is used and why it asserts that slots_lock is held.

No functional change intended.
