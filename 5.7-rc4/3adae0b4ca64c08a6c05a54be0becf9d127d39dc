KVM: s390: protvirt: Mask PSW interrupt bits for interception 104 and 112

We're not allowed to inject interrupts on intercepts that leave the
guest state in an "in-between" state where the next SIE entry will do a
continuation, namely secure instruction interception (104) and secure
prefix interception (112).
As our PSW is just a copy of the real one that will be replaced on the
next exit, we can mask out the interrupt bits in the PSW to make sure
that we do not inject anything.
