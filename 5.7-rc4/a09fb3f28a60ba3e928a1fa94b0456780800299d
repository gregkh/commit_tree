ASoC: rsnd: Fix parent SSI start/stop in multi-SSI mode

The parent SSI of a multi-SSI setup must be fully setup, started and
stopped since it is also part of the playback/capture setup. So only
skip the SSI (as per commit 203cdf51f288 ("ASoC: rsnd: SSI parent cares
SWSP bit") and commit 597b046f0d99 ("ASoC: rsnd: control SSICR::EN
correctly")) if the SSI is parent outside of a multi-SSI setup.
