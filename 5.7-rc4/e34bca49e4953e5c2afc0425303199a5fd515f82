media: hantro: Read be32 words starting at every fourth byte

Since (luma/chroma)_qtable is an array of unsigned char, indexing it
returns consecutive byte locations, but we are supposed to read the arrays
in four-byte words. Consequently, we should be pointing
get_unaligned_be32() at consecutive word locations instead.
