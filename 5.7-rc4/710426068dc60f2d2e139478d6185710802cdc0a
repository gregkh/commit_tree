srcu: Hold srcu_struct ->lock when updating ->srcu_gp_seq

A read of the srcu_struct structure's ->srcu_gp_seq field should not
need READ_ONCE() when that structure's ->lock is held.  Except that this
lock is not always held when updating this field.  This commit therefore
acquires the lock around updates and removes a now-unneeded READ_ONCE().

This data race was reported by KCSAN.
