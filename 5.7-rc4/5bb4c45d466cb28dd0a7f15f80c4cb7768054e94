net/tls: Read sk_prot once when building tls proto ops

Apart from being a "tremendous" win when it comes to generated machine
code (see bloat-o-meter output for x86-64 below) this mainly prepares
ground for annotating access to sk_prot with READ_ONCE, so that we don't
pepper the code with access annotations and needlessly repeat loads.
