drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Config number of DP lanes Mo' Betta

The driver used to say that the value to program into bridge register
0x93 was dp_lanes - 1.  Looking at the datasheet for the bridge, this
is wrong.  The data sheet says:
* 1 = 1 lane
* 2 = 2 lanes
* 3 = 4 lanes

A more proper way to express this encoding is min(dp_lanes, 3).

At the moment this change has zero effect because we've hardcoded the
number of DP lanes to 4.  ...and (4 - 1) == min(4, 3).  How fortunate!
...but soon we'll stop hardcoding the number of lanes.
