drm/xen: Explicitly disable automatic sending of vblank event

The atomic helpers automatically send out fake VBLANK events if no
vblanking has been initialized. This would apply to xen, but xen has
its own vblank logic. To avoid interfering with the atomic helpers,
disable automatic vblank events explicitly.

v5:
	* update comment
v4:
	* separate commit from core vblank changes
