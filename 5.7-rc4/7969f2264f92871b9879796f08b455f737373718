mm/vma: make vma_is_foreign() available for general use

Idea of a foreign VMA with respect to the present context is very generic.
But currently there are two identical definitions for this in powerpc and
x86 platforms.  Lets consolidate those redundant definitions while making
vma_is_foreign() available for general use later.  This should not cause
any functional change.
