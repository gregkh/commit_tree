scsi: bnx2fc: Fix SCSI command completion after cleanup is posted

Driver received a SCSI completion after it posted the cleanup request. This
leads to a problem that one ref count wasn't released leading to
flush_active_ios to get struck. The callback from libfc never returned and
other ports were not processed leading to APD.

Decrease the refcnt as well as try to complete if something is waiting for
completion.
