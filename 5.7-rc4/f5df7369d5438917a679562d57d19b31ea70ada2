dt-bindings: display: Convert a bunch of panels to DT schema

Convert all the 'simple' panels which match the constraints of the
common panel-simple.yaml schema. This conversion is based on how the
panels are documented. Some may turn out to be more complex once the
schema is applied to actual dts files.
