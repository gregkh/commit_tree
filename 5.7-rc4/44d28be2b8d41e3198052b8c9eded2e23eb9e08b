selftests/bpf: Tests for sockmap/sockhash holding listening sockets

Now that SOCKMAP and SOCKHASH map types can store listening sockets,
user-space and BPF API is open to a new set of potential pitfalls.

Exercise the map operations, with extra attention to code paths susceptible
to races between map ops and socket cloning, and BPF helpers that work with
SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH to gain confidence that all works as expected.
