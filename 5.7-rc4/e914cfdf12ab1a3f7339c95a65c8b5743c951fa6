iio: gyro: adis16136: initialize adis_data statically

This change overrides commit 380b107bbf944 ("iio: adis: Introduce timeouts
structure"). It removes the memory allocation and moves the 'adis_data'
information to be static on the chip_info struct.

This also adds a timeout structure to ADIS16334, since it was initially
omitted. This was omitted (by accident) when the change was done.
