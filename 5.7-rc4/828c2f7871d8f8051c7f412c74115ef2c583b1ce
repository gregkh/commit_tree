ASoC: SOF: Intel: remove unnecessary waitq before loading firmware

The HDA_DSP_IPC_PURGE_FW IPC from ROM is already handled in
cl_dsp_init(), and it will never be received in the IRQ thread,
so the wait condition on this IPC will never be satisfied. The
wait before loading firmware is redundant and can be removed safely.
