net: qrtr: Respond to HELLO message

Lost in the translation from the user space implementation was the
detail that HELLO mesages must be exchanged between each node pair.  As
such the incoming HELLO must be replied to.

Similar to the previous implementation no effort is made to prevent two
Linux boxes from continuously sending HELLO messages back and forth,
this is left to a follow up patch.

say_hello() is moved, to facilitate the new call site.
