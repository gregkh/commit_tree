ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for MOTU MicroBook IIc

MicroBook IIc operates in UAC2 mode by default. This patch addresses
several issues with it:

- MicroBook II and IIc shares the same USB ID. We can distinguish them
  by interface class.
- MaxPacketsOnly attribute is erroneously set in endpoint descriptors.
  As a result this card produces noise with all sample rates other than
  96 KHz. This also causes issues like IOMMU page faults and other
  problems with host controller.
- Sample rate changes takes more than 2 seconds for this device. Clock
  validity request returns false during that period, so the clock validity
  quirk is required.
