RISC-V: Add cpu_ops and modify default booting method

Currently, all non-booting harts start booting after the booting hart
updates the per-hart stack pointer. This is done in a way that, it's
difficult to implement any other booting method without breaking the
backward compatibility.

Define a cpu_ops method that allows to introduce other booting methods
in future. Modify the current booting method to be compatible with
cpu_ops.
