drm/i915: Fix i915_error_state_store error defination

Since commit 742379c0c4001 ("drm/i915: Start chopping up the GPU error
capture"), function 'i915_error_state_store' was defined and used with
only one parameter.

But if no 'CONFIG_DRM_I915_CAPTURE_ERROR', this function was defined
with two parameter.

This may lead compile error. This patch fix it.
