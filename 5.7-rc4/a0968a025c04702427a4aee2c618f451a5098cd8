selftests/powerpc: Add a test of sigreturn vs VDSO

There's two different paths through the sigreturn code, depending on
whether the VDSO is mapped or not. We recently discovered a bug in the
unmapped case, because it's not commonly used these days.

So add a test that sends itself a signal, then moves the VDSO, takes
another signal and finally unmaps the VDSO before sending itself
another signal. That tests the standard signal path, the code that
handles the VDSO being moved, and also the signal path in the case
where the VDSO is unmapped.
