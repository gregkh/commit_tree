sched/swait: Prepare usage in completions

As a preparation to use simple wait queues for completions:

  - Provide swake_up_all_locked() to support complete_all()
  - Make __prepare_to_swait() public available

This is done to enable the usage of complete() within truly atomic contexts
on a PREEMPT_RT enabled kernel.
