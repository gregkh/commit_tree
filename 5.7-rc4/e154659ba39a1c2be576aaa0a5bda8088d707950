mptcp: fix double-unlock in mptcp_poll

mptcp_connect/28740 is trying to release lock (sk_lock-AF_INET) at:
[<ffffffff82c15869>] mptcp_poll+0xb9/0x550
but there are no more locks to release!
Call Trace:
 lock_release+0x50f/0x750
 release_sock+0x171/0x1b0
 mptcp_poll+0xb9/0x550
 sock_poll+0x157/0x470
 ? get_net_ns+0xb0/0xb0
 do_sys_poll+0x63c/0xdd0

Problem is that __mptcp_tcp_fallback() releases the mptcp socket lock,
but after recent change it doesn't do this in all of its return paths.

To fix this, remove the unlock from __mptcp_tcp_fallback() and
always do the unlock in the caller.

Also add a small comment as to why we have this
__mptcp_needs_tcp_fallback().
