clk: tegra: Remove tegra_pmc_clk_init along with clk ids

Current Tegra clock driver registers PMC clocks clk_out_1, clk_out_2,
clk_out_3 and 32KHz blink output in tegra_pmc_init() which does direct
PMC register access during clk_ops and these PMC register read and write
access will not happen when PMC is in secure mode.

Any direct PMC register access from non-secure world will not go
through.

All the PMC clocks are moved to Tegra PMC driver with PMC as a clock
provider.

This patch removes tegra_pmc_clk_init along with corresponding clk ids
from Tegra clock driver.
