xfs: add a new xfs_sb_version_has_v3inode helper

Add a new wrapper to check if a file system supports the v3 inode format
with a larger dinode core.  Previously we used xfs_sb_version_hascrc for
that, which is technically correct but a little confusing to read.

Also move xfs_dinode_good_version next to xfs_sb_version_has_v3inode
so that we have one place that documents the superblock version to
inode version relationship.
