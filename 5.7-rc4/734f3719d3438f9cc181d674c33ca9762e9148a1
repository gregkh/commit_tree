net: wan: wanxl: use $(M68KCC) instead of $(M68KAS) for rebuilding firmware

The firmware source, wanxlfw.S, is currently compiled by the combo of
$(CPP) and $(M68KAS). This is not what we usually do for compiling *.S
files. In fact, this Makefile is the only user of $(AS) in the kernel
build.

Instead of combining $(CPP) and (AS) from different tool sets, using
$(M68KCC) as an assembler driver is simpler, and saner.
