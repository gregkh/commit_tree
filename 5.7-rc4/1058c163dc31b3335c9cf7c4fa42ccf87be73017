s390/mm: cleanup init_new_context() callback

The set of values asce_limit may be assigned with is TASK_SIZE_MAX,
_REGION1_SIZE, _REGION2_SIZE and 0 as a special case if the callback
was called from execve().
Do VM_BUG_ON() if asce_limit is something else.

Save few CPU cycles by removing unnecessary asce_limit re-assignment
in case of 3-level task and redundant PGD entry type reconstruction.
