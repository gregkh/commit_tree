tty: imx serial: Implement support for reversing TX and RX polarity

The peripheral has support for inverting its input and/or output
signals.  This is useful if the hardware flips polarity of the
peripheral's signal, such as swapped +/- pins on an RS-422 transceiver,
or an inverting level shifter.  Add support for these control registers
via the device tree binding.

As part of this change, make the writes of the various registers more
uniform by moving the UCR3 block up near the other registers' blocks,
since the INVT bit must be set before enabling the peripheral.
