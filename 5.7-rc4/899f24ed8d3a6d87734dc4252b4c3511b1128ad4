drm/panel: Add driver for Novatek NT35510-based panels

This adds a driver for panels based on the Novatek NT35510
display driver IC, such as the Hydis HVA40WV1 panel found
in the Samsung GT-S7710.

The NT35510 can be used with both internal and external
backlight (such as GPIO backlight) so we support both:
if no external backlight is found, we register a subdriver
for the internal backlight.
