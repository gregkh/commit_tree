soundwire: bus: fix io error when processing alert event

There are two types of io errors when processing alert event.

a) the Master detects an ALERT status for e.g. a jack event and
invokes the implementation-defined function in the Slave driver to
check the jack status. At this time the codec is just suspended, so io
registers can't be accessed.

b) when waking up from clock stop mode1 state, where the bus needs a
complete re-enumeration, Slave registers can't be accessed until the
enumeration is complete.

This patch resumes the Slave device and waits for initialization
complete when processing slave alert event, so that registers on the
Slave can be accessed without timeouts or io errors.
