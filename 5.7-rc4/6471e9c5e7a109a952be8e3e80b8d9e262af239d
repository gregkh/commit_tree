xfs: remove the di_version field from struct icdinode

We know the version is 3 if on a v5 file system.   For earlier file
systems formats we always upgrade the remaining v1 inodes to v2 and
thus only use v2 inodes.  Use the xfs_sb_version_has_large_dinode
helper to check if we deal with small or large dinodes, and thus
remove the need for the di_version field in struct icdinode.
