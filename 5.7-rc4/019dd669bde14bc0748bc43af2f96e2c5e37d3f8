gfs2: don't allow releasepage to free bd still used for revokes

Before this patch, function gfs2_releasepage would free any bd
elements that had been used for the page being released. However,
those bd elements may still be queued to the sd_log_revokes list,
in which case we cannot free them until the revoke has been issued.

This patch adds additional checks for bds that are still being
used for revokes.
