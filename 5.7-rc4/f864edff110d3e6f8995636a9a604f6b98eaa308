ASoC: qdsp6: q6routing: remove default routing

Frontend dais can be configured to rx or tx or both, however having default
routes without considering this configuration can lead to failures during
card probe as below for compress rx only case. These routing have to come
from sound card routing table in device tree.

"routing: ASoC: Failed to add route MM_UL1 -> direct -> MultiMedia1 Capture
msm-snd-sdm845 sound: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -19
