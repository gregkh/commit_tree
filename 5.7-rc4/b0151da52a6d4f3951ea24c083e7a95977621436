x86/resctrl: Fix invalid attempt at removing the default resource group

The default resource group ("rdtgroup_default") is associated with the
root of the resctrl filesystem and should never be removed. New resource
groups can be created as subdirectories of the resctrl filesystem and
they can be removed from user space.

There exists a safeguard in the directory removal code
(rdtgroup_rmdir()) that ensures that only subdirectories can be removed
by testing that the directory to be removed has to be a child of the
root directory.

A possible deadlock was recently fixed with

  334b0f4e9b1b ("x86/resctrl: Fix a deadlock due to inaccurate reference").

This fix involved associating the private data of the "mon_groups"
and "mon_data" directories to the resource group to which they belong
instead of NULL as before. A consequence of this change was that
the original safeguard code preventing removal of "mon_groups" and
"mon_data" found in the root directory failed resulting in attempts to
remove the default resource group that ends in a BUG:

  kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:3969!
  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI

  Call Trace:
  rdtgroup_rmdir+0x16b/0x2c0
  kernfs_iop_rmdir+0x5c/0x90
  vfs_rmdir+0x7a/0x160
  do_rmdir+0x17d/0x1e0
  do_syscall_64+0x55/0x1d0
  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9

Fix this by improving the directory removal safeguard to ensure that
subdirectories of the resctrl root directory can only be removed if they
are a child of the resctrl filesystem's root _and_ not associated with
the default resource group.
