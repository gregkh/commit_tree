media: allegro: remove unknown39 field from create_channel

The subframe_latency and lda_control_mode fields directly follow
freq_golden_ref field and there is no unknown field in between. The
unknown field it at the end of the message.

Reorder the fields accordingly. This further allows to drop the hard
coded value from the lda_control_mode field and set the mode to 0.
