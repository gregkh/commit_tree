ACPI / battery: Cleanup Lenovo Ideapad Miix 320 DMI table entry

The Lenovo Ideapad Miix 320 bat_dmi_table entry is using weird indentation
and is the only entry which (unnecessarily) uses DMI_EXACT_MATCH instead
of DMI_MATCH, fixup both to make the entry consistent with the others.

While at it also update the comments for battery_do_not_check_pmic_quirk
entries, adding a bit of text explaining why the quirk is necessary.
