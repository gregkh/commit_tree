torture: Allow disabling of boottime CPU-hotplug torture operations

In theory, RCU-hotplug operations are supposed to work as soon as there
is more than one CPU online.  However, in practice, in normal production
there is no way to make them happen until userspace is up and running.
Besides which, on smaller systems, rcutorture doesn't start doing hotplug
operations until 30 seconds after the start of boot, which on most
systems also means the better part of 30 seconds after the end of boot.
This commit therefore provides a new torture.disable_onoff_at_boot kernel
boot parameter that suppresses CPU-hotplug torture operations until
about the time that init is spawned.

Of course, if you know of a need for boottime CPU-hotplug operations,
then you should avoid passing this argument to any of the torture tests.
You might also want to look at the splats linked to below.
