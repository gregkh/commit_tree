crypto: ccree - only try to map auth tag if needed

Make sure to only add the size of the auth tag to the source mapping
for encryption if it is an in-place operation. Failing to do this
previously caused us to try and map auth size len bytes from a NULL
mapping and crashing if both the cryptlen and assoclen are zero.
