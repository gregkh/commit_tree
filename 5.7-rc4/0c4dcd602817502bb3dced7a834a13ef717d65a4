RDMA/bnxt_re: Refactor hardware queue memory allocation

At top level there are three major data structure addition.  viz
bnxt_qplib_hwq_attr, bnxt_qplib_sg_info and bnxt_qplib_tqm_ctx

Intorduction of first data structure reduces the arguments list to
bnxt_re_alloc_init_hwq() function. There are changes all over the driver
code to incorporate this new structure. The caller needs to fill the
attribute data structure and pass to this function.

The second data structure is to pass memory region description
viz. sghead, page_size and page_shift. There are changes all over the
driver code to initialize bnxt_re_sg_info data structure. The new data
structure helps to reduce the argument list of __alloc_pbl() function
call.

Till now the TQM rings related members were not collected under any
specific data-structure making it hard to manage. The third data
sctructure bnxt_qplib_tqm_ctx is added to refactor the TQM queue
allocation and initialization.
