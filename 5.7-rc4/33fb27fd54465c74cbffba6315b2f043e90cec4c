RDMA/siw: Fix passive connection establishment

Holding the rtnl_lock while iterating a devices interface address list
potentially causes deadlocks with the cma_netdev_callback. While this was
implemented to limit the scope of a wildcard listen to addresses of the
current device only, a better solution limits the scope of the socket to
the device. This completely avoiding locking, and also results in
significant code simplification.
