btrfs: push __setup_root into btrfs_alloc_root

There's no reason to not init the root at alloc time, and with later
patches it actually causes problems if we error out mounting the fs
before the tree_root is init'ed because we expect it to have a valid ref
count.  Fix this by pushing __setup_root into btrfs_alloc_root.
