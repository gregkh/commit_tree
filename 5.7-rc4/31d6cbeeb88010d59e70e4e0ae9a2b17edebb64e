net: qrtr: Fix the local node ID as 1

In order to start the QRTR nameservice, the local node ID needs to be
valid. Hence, fix it to 1. Previously, the node ID was configured through
a userspace tool before starting the nameservice daemon. Since we have now
integrated the nameservice handling to kernel, this change is necessary
for making it functional.
