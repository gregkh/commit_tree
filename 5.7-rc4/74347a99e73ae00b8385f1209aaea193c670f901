x86/Hyper-V: Unload vmbus channel in hv panic callback

When kdump is not configured, a Hyper-V VM might still respond to
network traffic after a kernel panic when kernel parameter panic=0.
The panic CPU goes into an infinite loop with interrupts enabled,
and the VMbus driver interrupt handler still works because the
VMbus connection is unloaded only in the kdump path.  The network
responses make the other end of the connection think the VM is
still functional even though it has panic'ed, which could affect any
failover actions that should be taken.

Fix this by unloading the VMbus connection during the panic process.
vmbus_initiate_unload() could then be called twice (e.g., by
hyperv_panic_event() and hv_crash_handler(), so reset the connection
state in vmbus_initiate_unload() to ensure the unload is done only
once.
