spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Fix bits-per-word acceleration in DMA mode

In DMA mode, dspi_setup_accel does not get called, which results in the
dspi->oper_word_size variable (which is used by dspi_dma_xfer) to not be
initialized properly.

Because oper_word_size is zero, a few calculations end up being
incorrect, and the DMA transfer eventually times out instead of sending
anything on the wire.

Set up native transfers (or 8-on-16 acceleration) using dspi_setup_accel
for DMA mode too.

Also take the opportunity and simplify the DMA buffer handling a little
bit.
