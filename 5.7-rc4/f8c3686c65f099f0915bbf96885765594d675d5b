serial: earlycon: prefer EARLYCON_DECLARE() variant

If a driver exposes early consoles with EARLYCON_DECLARE() and
OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE(), pefer the non-OF variant if the user specifies it
by
  earlycon=<driver>,<options>

The rationale behind this is that some drivers register multiple setup
functions under the same driver name. Eg.

OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE(lpuart, "fsl,vf610-lpuart", lpuart_early_console_setup);
OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE(lpuart32, "fsl,ls1021a-lpuart", lpuart32_early_console_setup);
OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE(lpuart32, "fsl,imx7ulp-lpuart", lpuart32_imx_early_console_setup);
EARLYCON_DECLARE(lpuart, lpuart_early_console_setup);
EARLYCON_DECLARE(lpuart32, lpuart32_early_console_setup);

It depends on the order of the entries which console_setup() actually
gets called. To make things worse, I guess it also depends on the
compiler how these are ordered. Thus always prefer the EARLYCON_DECLARE()
ones.
