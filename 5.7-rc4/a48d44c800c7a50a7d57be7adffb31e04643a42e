dmaengine: tegra-apb: mark PM functions as __maybe_unused

When CONFIG_PM is disabled, gcc warning this:

drivers/dma/tegra20-apb-dma.c:1587:12: warning: 'tegra_dma_runtime_resume' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
drivers/dma/tegra20-apb-dma.c:1578:12: warning: 'tegra_dma_runtime_suspend' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

Make it as __maybe_unused to fix the warnings,
also remove unneeded function declarations.
