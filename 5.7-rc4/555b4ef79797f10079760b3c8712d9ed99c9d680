vt: selection, localize use_unicode

use_unicode needs not be global. It is used only in set_selection_kernel
and sel_pos (a callee). It is also always set there prior calling
sel_pos. So make use_unicode local and rename it to plain shorter
"unicode". Finally, propagate it to sel_pos via parameter.
