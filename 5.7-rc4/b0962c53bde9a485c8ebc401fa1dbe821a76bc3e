scsi: core: avoid repetitive logging of device offline messages

Large queues of I/O to offline devices that are eventually submitted when
devices are unblocked result in a many repeated "rejecting I/O to offline
device" messages.  These messages can fill up the dmesg buffer in crash
dumps so no useful prior messages remain.  In addition, if a serial console
is used, the flood of messages can cause a hard lockup in the console code.

Introduce a flag indicating the message has already been logged for the
device, and reset the flag when scsi_device_set_state() changes the device
state.
