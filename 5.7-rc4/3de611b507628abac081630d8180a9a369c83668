selftests: mlxsw: Add a RED selftest

This tests that below the queue minimum length, there is no dropping /
marking, and above max, everything is dropped / marked.

The test is structured as a core file with topology and test code, and
three wrappers: one for RED used as a root Qdisc, and two for
testing (W)RED under PRIO and ETS.
