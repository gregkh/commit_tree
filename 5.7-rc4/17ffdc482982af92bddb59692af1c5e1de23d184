mm: simplify device private page handling in hmm_range_fault

Remove the HMM_PFN_DEVICE_PRIVATE flag, no driver has ever set this flag
on input, and the only place that uses it on output can be trivially
changed to use is_device_private_page().

This removes the ability to request that device_private pages are faulted
back into system memory.
