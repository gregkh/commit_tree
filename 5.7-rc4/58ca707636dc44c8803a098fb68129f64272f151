perf expr: Increase EXPR_MAX_OTHER to support metrics with more than 15 variables

We have metrics that define more than 15 variables, like
Branch_Misprediction_Cost. Increasing the allowed variables count to 20.

As Andy pointed out, we can't go too high in here, because some of the
code has O(n^2) complexity (already_seen) and we might want to do some
other changes (like using hash tables) before increasing the maximum
even more.
