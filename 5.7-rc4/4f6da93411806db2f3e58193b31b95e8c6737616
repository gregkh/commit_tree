mm/gup: rename "nonblocking" to "locked" where proper

Patch series "mm: Page fault enhancements", v6.

This series contains cleanups and enhancements to current page fault
logic.  The whole idea comes from the discussion between Andrea and Linus
on the bug reported by syzbot here:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/2/833

Basically it does two things:

  (a) Allows the page fault logic to be more interactive on not only
      SIGKILL, but also the rest of userspace signals, and,

  (b) Allows the page fault retry (VM_FAULT_RETRY) to happen for more
      than once.

For (a): with the changes we should be able to react faster when page
faults are working in parallel with userspace signals like SIGSTOP and
SIGCONT (and more), and with that we can remove the buggy part in
userfaultfd and benefit the whole page fault mechanism on faster signal
processing to reach the userspace.

For (b), we should be able to allow the page fault handler to loop for
even more than twice.  Some context: for now since we have
FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY we can allow to retry the page fault once with the
same interrupt context, however never more than twice.  This can be not
only a potential cleanup to remove this assumption since AFAIU the code
itself doesn't really have this twice-only limitation (though that should
be a protective approach in the past), at the same time it'll greatly
simplify future works like userfaultfd write-protect where it's possible
to retry for more than twice (please have a look at [1] below for a
possible user that might require the page fault to be handled for a third
time; if we can remove the retry limitation we can simply drop that patch
and those complexity).

This patch (of 16):

There's plenty of places around __get_user_pages() that has a parameter
"nonblocking" which does not really mean that "it won't block" (because it
can really block) but instead it shows whether the mmap_sem is released by
up_read() during the page fault handling mostly when VM_FAULT_RETRY is
returned.

We have the correct naming in e.g.  get_user_pages_locked() or
get_user_pages_remote() as "locked", however there're still many places
that are using the "nonblocking" as name.

Renaming the places to "locked" where proper to better suite the
functionality of the variable.  While at it, fixing up some of the
comments accordingly.
