io_uring: use io-wq manager as backup task if task is exiting

If the original task is (or has) exited, then the task work will not get
queued properly. Allow for using the io-wq manager task to queue this
work for execution, and ensure that the io-wq manager notices and runs
this work if woken up (or exiting).
