powerpc/eeh: Rework eeh_ops->probe()

With the EEH early probe now being pseries specific there's no need for
eeh_ops->probe() to take a pci_dn. Instead, we can make it take a pci_dev
and use the probe function to map a pci_dev to an eeh_dev. This allows
the platform to implement it's own method for finding (or creating) an
eeh_dev for a given pci_dev which also removes a use of pci_dn in
generic EEH code.

This patch also renames eeh_device_add_late() to eeh_device_probe(). This
better reflects what it does does and removes the last vestiges of the
early/late EEH probe split.
