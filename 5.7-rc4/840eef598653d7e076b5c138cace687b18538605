ionic: print data for unknown xcvr type

If we don't recognize the transceiver type, set the xcvr type
and data length such that ethtool can at least print the first
256 bytes and the reader can figure out why the transceiver
is not recognized.

While we're here, we can update the phy_id type values to use
the enum values in sfp.h.
