mm: use zone and order instead of free area in free_list manipulators

In order to enable the use of the zone from the list manipulator functions
I will need access to the zone pointer.  As it turns out most of the
accessors were always just being directly passed &zone->free_area[order]
anyway so it would make sense to just fold that into the function itself
and pass the zone and order as arguments instead of the free area.

In order to be able to reference the zone we need to move the declaration
of the functions down so that we have the zone defined before we define
the list manipulation functions.  Since the functions are only used in the
file mm/page_alloc.c we can just move them there to reduce noise in the
header.
