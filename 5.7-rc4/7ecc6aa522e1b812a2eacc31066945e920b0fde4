Documentation/locking/locktypes: Further clarifications and wordsmithing

The documentation of rw_semaphores is wrong as it claims that the non-owner
reader release is not supported by RT. That's just history biased memory
distortion.

Split the 'Owner semantics' section up and add separate sections for
semaphore and rw_semaphore to reflect reality.

Aside of that the following updates are done:

 - Add pseudo code to document the spinlock state preserving mechanism on
   PREEMPT_RT

 - Wordsmith the bitspinlock and lock nesting sections
