ASoC: zte: zx-tdm: remove redundant variables dev

In this function, the variable 'dev' is assigned to '&pdev->dev',
but in the following code, all the assignments to 'struce device'
are used '&pdev->dev' instead of 'dev',except 'zx_tdm->dev'.
So,the variable 'dev' in this function is redundant and can be
replaced by '&pdev->dev' as elsewhere.
