Documentation: cpufreq: Move legacy driver documentation

There are three legacy driver documents in Documentation/cpu-freq/
that were added years ago and converting them each to the .rst
format is rather pointless, even though there is some value in
preserving them.  However, if they are preserved, they need to go
into the admin-guide part of cpufreq documentation where they belong
(at least to a certain extent).

To preserve them with minimum amount of changes and put them into the
right place, and make it possible to process them into HTML (and other
formats) along with the rest of the documentation, move them each
as a "literal text" block into a separate section of a single .rst
"wrapper" file under Documentation/admin-guide/pm/.

While at it, repair the PCC specification URL in one of them.
