clk: qcom: gpucc: Add support for GX GDSC for SC7180

Most of the time the CPU should not be touching the GX domain on the
GPU except for a very special use case when the CPU needs to force the
GX headswitch off. Add the GX domain for that use case.  As part of
this add a dummy enable function for the GX gdsc to simulate success
so that the pm_runtime reference counting is correct.  This matches
what was done in sdm845 in commit 85a3d920d30a ("clk: qcom: Add a
dummy enable function for GX gdsc").
