iwlwifi: move TH1 devices to the new table

TH1 devices can now be fully differentiated by using the device
parameters we have (particularly the RF_TYPE).  Start using these
parameters instead of hardcoding to specific subsystem device IDs.

This also fixes the name of one of the TH1 devices that was
erroneously using the 9260 struct and renames 9160 to 9162.
