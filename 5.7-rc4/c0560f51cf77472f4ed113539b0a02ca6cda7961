vfio: allow external user to get vfio group from device

external user calls vfio_group_get_external_user_from_dev() with a device
pointer to get the VFIO group associated with this device.
The VFIO group is checked to be vialbe and have IOMMU set. Then
container user counter is increased and VFIO group reference is hold
to prevent the VFIO group from disposal before external user exits.

when the external user finishes using of the VFIO group, it calls
vfio_group_put_external_user() to dereference the VFIO group and the
container user counter.
