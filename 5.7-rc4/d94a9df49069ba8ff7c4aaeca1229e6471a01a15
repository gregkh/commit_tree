sched/rt: Remove unnecessary push for unfit tasks

In task_woken_rt() and switched_to_rto() we try trigger push-pull if the
task is unfit.

But the logic is found lacking because if the task was the only one
running on the CPU, then rt_rq is not in overloaded state and won't
trigger a push.

The necessity of this logic was under a debate as well, a summary of
the discussion can be found in the following thread:

Remove the logic for now until a better approach is agreed upon.
