gpio: brcmstb: support gpio-line-names property

The default handling of the gpio-line-names property by the
gpiolib-of implementation does not work with the multiple
gpiochip banks per device structure used by the gpio-brcmstb
driver.

This commit adds driver level support for the device tree
property so that GPIO lines can be assigned friendly names.
