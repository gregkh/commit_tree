objtool: Optimize find_rela_by_dest_range()

Perf shows there is significant time in find_rela_by_dest(); this is
because we have to iterate the address space per byte, looking for
relocation entries.

Optimize this by reducing the address space granularity.

This reduces objtool on vmlinux.o runtime from 4.8 to 4.4 seconds.
