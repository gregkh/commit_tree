clk: mmp2: Stop pretending PLL outputs are constant

The hardcoded values for PLL1 and PLL2 are wrong. PLL1 is slightly
off -- it defaults to 797.33 MHz, not 800 MHz. PLL2 is disabled by default,
but also configurable.

Tested on a MMP2-based OLPC XO-1.75 laptop, with PLL1=797.33 and various
values of PLL2 set via set-pll2-520mhz, set-pll2-910mhz and
set-pll2-988mhz Open Firmware words.
