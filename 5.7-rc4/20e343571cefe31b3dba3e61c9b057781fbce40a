lookup_fast(): take mount traversal into callers

Current calling conventions: -E... on error, 0 on cache miss,
result of handle_mounts(nd, dentry, path, inode, seqp) on
success.  Turn that into returning ERR_PTR(-E...), NULL and dentry
resp.; deal with handle_mounts() in the callers.  The thing
is, they already do that in cache miss handling case, so we
just need to supply dentry to them and unify the mount traversal
in those cases.  Fewer arguments that way, and we get closer
to merging handle_mounts() and step_into().
