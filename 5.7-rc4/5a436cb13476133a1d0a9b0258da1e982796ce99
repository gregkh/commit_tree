staging: rtl8723bs: remove temporary variable CrystalCap

Currently variable CrystalCap is being initialized with the value
0x20 that is never read so that is redundant and can be removed.
Clean up the code by removing the need for variable CrystalCap
since the calculation of the return value is relatively simple.
