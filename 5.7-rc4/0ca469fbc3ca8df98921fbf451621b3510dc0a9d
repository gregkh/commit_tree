ice: allow bigger VFs

Unlike the XL710 series, 800-series hardware can allocate more than 4
MSI-X vectors per VF. This patch enables that functionality. We
dynamically allocate vectors and queues depending on how many VFs are
enabled. Allocating the maximum number of VFs replicates XL710
behavior with 4 queues and 4 vectors. But allocating a smaller number
of VFs will give you 16 queues and 16 vectors.
