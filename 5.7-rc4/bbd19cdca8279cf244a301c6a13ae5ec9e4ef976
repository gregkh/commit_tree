ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: add WAKEEN interrupt support for SoundWire

When a SoundWire link is in clock stop state, a Slave device may wake
up the Master for some events such as jack detection. The WAKEEN
interrupt will be triggered and processed by the audio pci device.

If audio device is in D3, the interrupt will be routed to PME, or
aggregated at cAVS level as interrupt when audio device is in D0. This
patch only supports D3 case, where the audio pci device will be
resumed by a PME event and the WAKEEN interrupt will be processed
after audio pci device is powered up and ROM is initialized
successfully.

The WAKEEN handling is only enabled after the first boot due to
dependencies on a shim_lock mutex being initialized.
