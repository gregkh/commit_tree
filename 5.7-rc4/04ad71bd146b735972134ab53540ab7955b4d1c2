drm/amd/display: Use uint64_t logger_mask instead of uint32_t

[WHY]
enum dc_log_type has more than 32 entries. User cannot set larger entries,
like LOG_DSC. Logs from LOG_GAMMA_DEBUG where being printed even though
flag was not enabled, because dal_logger_should_log check erroneously
passed.

[HOW]
Change struct dal_logger.mask and struct dc_init_data.mask to uint64_t.
