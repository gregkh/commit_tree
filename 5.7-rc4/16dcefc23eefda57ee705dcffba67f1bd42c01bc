ASoC: SOF: Intel: Fix stream cleanup on hw free

Field "substream" gets assigned during stream setup in
hda_dsp_pcm_hw_params() but it is never cleared afterwards during
cleanup procedure. Now, any non-pcm operation e.g.: compress can
mistakenly make use of that pointer as it's bypassing all
"if (s->substream)" checks.

Nulling the pointer during hw_free operation ensures no wild pointers
are left behind.
