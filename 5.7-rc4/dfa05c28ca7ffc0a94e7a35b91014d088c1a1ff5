checkpatch: remove email address comment from email address comparisons

About 2% of the last 100K commits have email addresses that include an
RFC2822 compliant comment like:

	Peter Zijlstra (Intel) <peterz@infradead.org>

checkpatch currently does a comparison of the complete name and address to
the submitted author to determine if the author has signed-off and emits a
warning if the exact email names and addresses do not match.

Unfortunately, the author email address can be written without the comment
like:

	Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>

Add logic to compare the comment stripped email addresses to avoid this
warning.
