scsi: ufs: set load before setting voltage in regulators

This sequence change is required to avoid dips in voltage during boot-up.

Apparently, this dip is caused because in the original sequence, the
regulators are initialized in lpm mode.  And then when the load is set to
high, and more current is drawn, than is allowed in lpm, the dip is seen.
