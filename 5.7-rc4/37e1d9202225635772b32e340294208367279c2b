bpf: Replace cant_sleep() with cant_migrate()

As already discussed in the previous change which introduced
BPF_RUN_PROG_PIN_ON_CPU() BPF only requires to disable migration to
guarantee per CPUness.

If RT substitutes the preempt disable based migration protection then the
cant_sleep() check will obviously trigger as preemption is not disabled.

Replace it by cant_migrate() which maps to cant_sleep() on a non RT kernel
and will verify that migration is disabled on a full RT kernel.
