tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Don't try to manually disable the console

The geni serial driver's shutdown code had a special case to call
console_stop().  Grepping through the code, it was the only serial
driver doing something like this (the only other caller of
console_stop() was in serial_core.c).

As far as I can tell there's no reason to call console_stop() in the
geni code.  ...and a good reason _not_ to call it.  Specifically if
you have an agetty running on the same serial port as the console then
killing the agetty kills your console and if you start the agetty
again the console doesn't come back.
