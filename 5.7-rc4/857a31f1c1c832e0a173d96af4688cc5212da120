media: allegro: extract mcu and codec address calculation

The mcu and the codec use 32 bit addresses which are sent via the
firmware messages. Add helper functions for this address calculation to
make it obvious which address is used in the message.

As the mcu and the codec have a limited address space, print warnings if
the addresses are outside the respective address space.
