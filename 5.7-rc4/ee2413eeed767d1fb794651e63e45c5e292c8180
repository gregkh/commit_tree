drm/i915: Add mechanism to submit a context WA on ring submission

This patch adds framework to submit an arbitrary batchbuffer on each
context switch to clear residual state for render engine on Gen7/7.5
devices.

The idea of always emitting the context and vm setup around each request
is primary to make reset recovery easy, and not require rewriting the
ringbuffer. As each request would set up its own context, leaving it to
the HW to notice and elide no-op context switches, we could restart the
ring at any point, and reorder the requests freely.

However, to avoid emitting clear_residuals() between consecutive requests
in the ringbuffer of the same context, we do want to track the current
context in the ring. In doing so, we need to be careful to only record a
context switch when we are sure the next request will be emitted.

This security mitigation change does not trigger any performance
regression. Performance is on par with current mainline/drm-tip.

v2: Update vm_alias params to point to correct address space "vm" due to
changes made in the patch "f21613797bae98773"
