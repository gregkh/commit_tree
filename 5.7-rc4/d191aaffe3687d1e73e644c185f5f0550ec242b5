MIPS/tlbex: Fix LDDIR usage in setup_pw() for Loongson-3

LDDIR/LDPTE is Loongson-3's acceleration for Page Table Walking. If BD
(Base Directory, the 4th page directory) is not enabled, then GDOffset
is biased by BadVAddr[63:62]. So, if GDOffset (aka. BadVAddr[47:36] for
Loongson-3) is big enough, "0b11(BadVAddr[63:62])|BadVAddr[47:36]|...."
can far beyond pg_swapper_dir. This means the pg_swapper_dir may NOT be
accessed by LDDIR correctly, so fix it by set PWDirExt in CP0_PWCtl.
