nvmem: sprd: Optimize the block lock operation

We have some cases that will programme the eFuse block partially multiple
times, so we should allow the block to be programmed again if it was
programmed partially. But we should lock the block if the whole block
was programmed. Thus add a condition to validate if we need lock the
block or not.

Moreover we only enable the auto-check function when locking the block.
