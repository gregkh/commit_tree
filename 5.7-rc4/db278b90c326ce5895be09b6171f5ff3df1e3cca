perf/x86/intel: Output LBR TOS information correctly

For Intel LBR, the LBR Top-of-Stack (TOS) information is the HW index of
raw branch record for the most recent branch.

For non-adaptive PEBS and non-PEBS, the TOS information can be directly
retrieved from TOS MSR read in intel_pmu_lbr_read().

For adaptive PEBS, the LBR information stored in PEBS record doesn't
include the TOS information. For single PEBS, TOS can be directly read
from MSR, because the PMI is triggered immediately after PEBS is
written. TOS MSR is still unchanged.
For large PEBS, TOS MSR has stale value. Set -1ULL to indicate that the
TOS information is not available.
