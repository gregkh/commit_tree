pinctrl: Use new GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION

Use newly added GPIO defines GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_IN and
GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_OUT instead of using hard-coded 1 and 0.

Main benefit is to make it easier to see which values mean IN and which
OUT. As a side effect this helps GPIO framework to change the direction
defines to something else if ever needed.

Please note that return value from get_direction call on
pinctrl-axp209 driver was changed. Previously pinctrl-axp209 might have
returned value 2 for direction INPUT.
