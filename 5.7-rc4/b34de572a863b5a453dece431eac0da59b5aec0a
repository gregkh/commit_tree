KVM: X86: trigger kvmclock sync request just once on VM creation

In the progress of vCPUs creation, it queues a kvmclock sync worker to the global
workqueue before each vCPU creation completes. The workqueue subsystem guarantees
not to queue the already queued work; however, we can make the logic more clear by
making just one leader to trigger this kvmclock sync request, and also save on
cacheline bouncing caused by test_and_set_bit.
