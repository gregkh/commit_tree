mtd: implement proper partition handling

Instead of collecting partitions in a flat list, create a hierarchy
within the mtd_info structure: use a partitions list to keep track of
the partitions of an MTD device (which might be itself a partition of
another MTD device), a pointer to the parent device (NULL when the MTD
device is the root one, not a partition).

By also saving directly in mtd_info the offset of the partition, we
can get rid of the mtd_part structure.

While at it, be consistent in the naming of the mtd_info structures to
ease the understanding of the new hierarchy: these structures are
usually called 'mtd', unless there are multiple instances of the same
structure. In this case, there is usually a parent/child bound so we
will call them 'parent' and 'child'.
