KVM: x86: Use KVM cpu caps to mark CR4.LA57 as not-reserved

Add accessor(s) for KVM cpu caps and use said accessor to detect
hardware support for LA57 instead of manually querying CPUID.

Note, the explicit conversion to bool via '!!' in kvm_cpu_cap_has() is
technically unnecessary, but it gives people a warm fuzzy feeling.

No functional change intended.
