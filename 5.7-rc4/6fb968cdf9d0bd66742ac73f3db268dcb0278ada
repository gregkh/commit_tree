atomic_open(): return the right dentry in FMODE_OPENED case

->atomic_open() might have used a different alias than the one we'd
passed to it; in "not opened" case we take care of that, in "opened"
one we don't.  Currently we don't care downstream of "opened" case
which alias to return; however, that will change shortly when we
get to unifying may_open() calls.

It's not hard to get right in all cases, anyway.
