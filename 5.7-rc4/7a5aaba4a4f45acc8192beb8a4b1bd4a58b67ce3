ASoC: soc-pcm: add snd_soc_runtime_action()

ALSA SoC has snd_soc_runtime_activate() / snd_soc_runtime_deactivate().
These increment or decrement DAI/Component activity, but the code
difference is only +1 or -1.
This patch adds common snd_soc_runtime_action() which can get +1 or -1 as
parameter, and use it from snd_soc_runtime_activate/deactivate() to
avoid duplicate implementation.
