tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Enhance core-power info command

In addition to CLOS enable status, also show the core-power feature
status. This will help why clos enable status didn't give desired
results as the core-power feature may be disabled or unsupported.

The new display looks as follows:

$intel-speed-select core-power info
Intel(R) Speed Select Technology
..
 package-0
  die-0
    cpu-0
      core-power
        support-status:supported
        enable-status:enabled
        clos-enable-status:1
        priority-type:0

In the above display "support-status" and "enable-status", shows the
status of the core-power feature and "clos-enable-status", shows the
status of the clos.
