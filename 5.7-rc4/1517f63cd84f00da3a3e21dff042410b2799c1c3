crypto: caam - drop global context pointer and init_done

Leverage devres to get rid of code storing global context as well as
init_done flag.

Original code also has a circular deallocation dependency where
unregister_algs() -> caam_rng_exit() -> caam_jr_free() chain would
only happen if all of JRs were freed. Fix this by moving
caam_rng_exit() outside of unregister_algs() and doing it specifically
for JR that instantiated HWRNG.
