drm/dp: Introduce EDID-based quirks

The whole point of using OUIs is so that we can recognize certain
devices and potentially apply quirks for them. Normally this should work
quite well, but there appears to be quite a number of laptop panels out
there that will fill the OUI but not the device ID. As such, for devices
like this I can't imagine it's a very good idea to try relying on OUIs
for applying quirks. As well, some laptop vendors have confirmed to us
that their panels have this exact issue.

So, let's introduce the ability to apply DP quirks based on EDID
identification. We reuse the same quirk bits for OUI-based quirks, so
that callers can simply check all possible quirks using
drm_dp_has_quirk().
