PCI: endpoint: Use notification chain mechanism to notify EPC events to EPF

Use atomic_notifier_call_chain() to notify EPC events like linkup to EPF
driver instead of using linkup ops in EPF driver. This is in preparation
for adding proper locking mechanism to EPF ops. This will also enable to
add more events (in addition to linkup) in the future.
