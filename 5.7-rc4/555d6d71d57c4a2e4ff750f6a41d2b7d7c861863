integrity: Remove duplicate pr_fmt definitions

The #define for formatting log messages, pr_fmt, is duplicated in the
files under security/integrity.

This change moves the definition to security/integrity/integrity.h and
removes the duplicate definitions in the other files under
security/integrity.

With this change, the messages in the following files will be prefixed
with 'integrity'.

     security/integrity/platform_certs/platform_keyring.c
     security/integrity/platform_certs/load_powerpc.c
     security/integrity/platform_certs/load_uefi.c
     security/integrity/iint.c

     e.g. "integrity: Error adding keys to platform keyring %s\n"

And the messages in the following file will be prefixed with 'ima'.

     security/integrity/ima/ima_mok.c

     e.g. "ima: Allocating IMA blacklist keyring.\n"

For the rest of the files under security/integrity, there will be no
change in the message format.
