hyper-v: Remove internal types from UAPI header

The uuid_le mistakenly comes to be an UAPI type. Since it's luckily not used by
Hyper-V APIs, we may replace with POD types, i.e. __u8 array.

Note, previously shared uuid_be had been removed from UAPI few releases ago.
This is a continuation of that process towards removing uuid_le one.

Note, there is no ABI change!
