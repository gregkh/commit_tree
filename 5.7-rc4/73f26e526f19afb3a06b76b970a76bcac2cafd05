x86/Hyper-V: Trigger crash enlightenment only once during system crash.

When a guest VM panics, Hyper-V should be notified only once via the
crash synthetic MSRs.  Current Linux code might write these crash MSRs
twice during a system panic:
1) hyperv_panic/die_event() calling hyperv_report_panic()
2) hv_kmsg_dump() calling hyperv_report_panic_msg()

Fix this by not calling hyperv_report_panic() if a kmsg dump has been
successfully registered.  The notification will happen later via
hyperv_report_panic_msg().
