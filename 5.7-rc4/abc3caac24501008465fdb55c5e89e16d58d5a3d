ASoC: topology: Add missing memory checks

kstrdup is an allocation function and it can fail, so its return value
should be checked and handled appropriately.

In order to check all cases, we need to modify set_stream_info to return
a value, so check that everything went correctly when doing kstrdup().
Later add proper checks and error handlers.
