KVM: CPUID: add support for supervisor states

Current CPUID 0xd enumeration code does not support supervisor
states, because KVM only supports setting IA32_XSS to zero.
Change it instead to use a new variable supported_xss, to be
set from the hardware_setup callback which is in charge of CPU
capabilities.
