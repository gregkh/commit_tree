Documentation,selinux: deprecate setting checkreqprot to 1

Deprecate setting the SELinux checkreqprot tunable to 1 via kernel
parameter or /sys/fs/selinux/checkreqprot.  Setting it to 0 is left
intact for compatibility since Android and some Linux distributions
do so for security and treat an inability to set it as a fatal error.
Eventually setting it to 0 will become a no-op and the kernel will
stop using checkreqprot's value internally altogether.

checkreqprot was originally introduced as a compatibility mechanism
for legacy userspace and the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality flag.
However, if set to 1, it weakens security by allowing mappings to be
made executable without authorization by policy.  The default value
for the SECURITY_SELINUX_CHECKREQPROT_VALUE config option was changed
from 1 to 0 in commit 2a35d196c160e3 ("selinux: change
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_CHECKREQPROT_VALUE default") and both Android
and Linux distributions began explicitly setting
/sys/fs/selinux/checkreqprot to 0 some time ago.
