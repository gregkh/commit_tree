usb: gadget: udc: bdc: Remove unnecessary NULL checks in bdc_req_complete

When building with Clang + -Wtautological-pointer-compare:

drivers/usb/gadget/udc/bdc/bdc_ep.c:543:28: warning: comparison of
address of 'req->queue' equal to a null pointer is always false
[-Wtautological-pointer-compare]
        if (req == NULL  || &req->queue == NULL || &req->usb_req == NULL)
                             ~~~~~^~~~~    ~~~~
drivers/usb/gadget/udc/bdc/bdc_ep.c:543:51: warning: comparison of
address of 'req->usb_req' equal to a null pointer is always false
[-Wtautological-pointer-compare]
        if (req == NULL  || &req->queue == NULL || &req->usb_req == NULL)
                                                    ~~~~~^~~~~~~    ~~~~
2 warnings generated.

As it notes, these statements will always evaluate to false so remove
them.
