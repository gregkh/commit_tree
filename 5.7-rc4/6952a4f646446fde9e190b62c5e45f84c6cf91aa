selftests: add pid namespace ENOMEM regression test

We recently regressed (cf. [1] and its corresponding fix in [2]) returning
ENOMEM when trying to create a process in a pid namespace whose init
process/child subreaper has already died. This has caused confusion at
least once before that (cf. [3]). Let's add a simple regression test to
catch this in the future.
