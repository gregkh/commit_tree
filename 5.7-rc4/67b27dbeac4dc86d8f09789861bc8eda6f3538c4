phy: qualcomm: Add Synopsys 28nm Hi-Speed USB PHY driver

Adds Qualcomm 28nm Hi-Speed USB PHY driver support. This PHY is usually
paired with Synopsys DWC3 USB controllers on Qualcomm SoCs.

The PHY can come in two flavours femtoPHY or picoPHY. This commit adds
support for the femtoPHY with the possibility of extending to the picoPHY
with additional future commits. Both PHYs are on a 28 nanometer process
node.
