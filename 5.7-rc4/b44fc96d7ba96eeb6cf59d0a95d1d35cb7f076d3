powerpc/64s/exception: Reconcile interrupts in system_reset

This adds IRQ_HARD_DIS to irq_happened. Although it doesn't seem to
matter much because we're not allowed to enable irqs in an NMI
handler, the soft-irq debugging code is becoming more strict about
ensuring IRQ_HARD_DIS is in sync with MSR[EE], this may help avoid
asserts or other issues.

Add a comment explaining why MCE does not have this. Early machine
check is generally much smaller and more contained code which will
explode if you look at it wrong anyway as it runs in real mode, though
there's an argument that we should do similar reconciling for the MCE
as well.
