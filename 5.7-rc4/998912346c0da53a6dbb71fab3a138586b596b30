media: ov519: add missing endpoint sanity checks

Make sure to check that we have at least one endpoint before accessing
the endpoint array to avoid dereferencing a NULL-pointer on stream
start.

Note that these sanity checks are not redundant as the driver is mixing
looking up altsettings by index and by number, which need not coincide.
