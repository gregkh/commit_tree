serial: core: Refactor uart_unlock_and_check_sysrq()

Refactor uart_unlock_and_check_sysrq() to:

  - explicitly show that we release a port lock which makes
    static analyzers happy:

CHECK   drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c
.../serial_core.c:3290:17: warning: context imbalance in 'uart_unlock_and_check_sysrq' - unexpected unlock

  - use flags instead of irqflags to avoid confusion with IRQ flags

  - provide one return point

  - be more compact
