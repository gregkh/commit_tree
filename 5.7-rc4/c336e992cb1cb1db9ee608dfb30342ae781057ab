io_uring: remove bogus RLIMIT_NOFILE check in file registration

We already checked this limit when the file was opened, and we keep it
open in the file table. Hence when we added unit_inflight to the count
we want to register, we're doubly accounting these files. This results
in -EMFILE for file registration, if we're at half the limit.
