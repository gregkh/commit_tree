s390/qeth: add TX IRQ coalescing support for IQD devices

Since IQD devices complete (most of) their transmissions synchronously,
they don't offer TX completion IRQs and have no HW coalescing controls.
But we can fake the easy parts in SW, and give the user some control wrt
to how often the TX NAPI code should be triggered to process the TX
completions.

Having per-queue controls can in particular help the dedicated mcast
queue, as it likely benefits from different fine-tuning than what the
ucast queues need.
