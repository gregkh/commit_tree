CIFS: check new file size when extending file by fallocate

xfstests generic/228 checks if fallocate respect RLIMIT_FSIZE.
After fallocate mode 0 extending enabled, we can hit this failure.
Fix this by check the new file size with vfs helper, return
error if file size is larger then RLIMIT_FSIZE(ulimit -f).

This patch has been tested by LTP/xfstests aginst samba and
Windows server.
