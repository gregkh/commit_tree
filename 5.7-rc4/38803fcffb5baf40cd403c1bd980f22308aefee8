nvme-fcloop: fix deallocation of working context

There's been a longstanding bug of LS completions which freed ls ops,
particularly the disconnect LS, while executing on a work context that
is in the memory being free. Not a good thing to do.

Rework LS handling to make callbacks in the rport context rather than
the ls_request context.
