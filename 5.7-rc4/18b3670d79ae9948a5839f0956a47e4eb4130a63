tpm: ibmvtpm: Add support for TPM2

Support TPM2 in the IBM vTPM driver. The hypervisor tells us what
version of TPM is connected through the vio_device_id.

In case a TPM2 device is found, we set the TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag
and get the command codes attributes table. The driver does
not need the timeouts and durations, though.
