PM: QoS: Clean up pm_qos_read_value() and pm_qos_get/set_value()

Move the definition of pm_qos_read_value() before the one of
pm_qos_get_value() and add a kerneldoc comment to it (as it is
not static).

Also replace the BUG() in pm_qos_get_value() with WARN() (to
prevent the kernel from crashing if an unknown PM QoS type is
used by mistake) and drop the comment next to it that is not
necessary any more.

Additionally, drop the unnecessary inline modifier from the header
of pm_qos_set_value().
