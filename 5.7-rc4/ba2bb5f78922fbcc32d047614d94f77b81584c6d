nvmem: jz4780-efuse: fix build warnings on ARCH=x86_64 or riscv

kbuild-robot did find a type error in the min(a, b)
function used by this driver if built for x86_64 or riscv.

Althought it is very unlikely that this driver is built
for those platforms it could be used as a template
for something else and therefore should be correct.

The problem is that we implicitly cast a size_t to
unsigned int inside the implementation of the min() function.

Since size_t may differ on different compilers and
plaforms there may be warnings or not.

So let's use only size_t variables on all platforms.
