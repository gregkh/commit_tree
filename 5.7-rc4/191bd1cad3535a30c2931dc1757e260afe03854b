dmaengine: at_xdmac: Fix locking in tasklet

Tasklets run with all the interrupts enabled. This means that we should
replace all the (already present) spin_lock_irqsave() uses in the tasklet
with spin_lock_irq() to protect being interrupted by a IRQ which tries
to get the same lock (via calls to device_prep_dma_* for example).

spin_lock and spin_lock_bh in tasklets are not enough to protect from IRQs,
update these to spin_lock_irq().

at_xdmac_advance_work() can be called with all the interrupts enabled (when
called from tasklet), or with interrupts disabled (when called from
at_xdmac_issue_pending). Move the locking in the callers to be able to use
spin_lock_irq() and spin_lock_irqsave() for these cases.
