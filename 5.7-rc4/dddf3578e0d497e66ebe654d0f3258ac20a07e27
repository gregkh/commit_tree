ARM: Don't use disable_nonboot_cpus()

disable_nonboot_cpus() is not safe to use when doing machine_down(),
because it relies on freeze_secondary_cpus() which in turn is
a suspend/resume related freeze and could abort if the logic detects any
pending activities that can prevent finishing the offlining process.

Beside disable_nonboot_cpus() is dependent on CONFIG_PM_SLEEP_SMP which
is an othogonal config to rely on to ensure this function works
correctly.
