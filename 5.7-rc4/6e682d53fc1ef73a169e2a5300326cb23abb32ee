um: ubd: Prevent buffer overrun on command completion

On the hypervisor side, when completing commands and the pipe is full,
we retry writing only the entries that failed, by offsetting
io_req_buffer, but we don't reduce the number of bytes written, which
can cause a buffer overrun of io_req_buffer, and write garbage to the
pipe.
