ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for Presonus Studio 1810c

This patch adds support for Presonus Studio 1810c, a usb interface
that's UAC2 compliant with a few quirks and a few extra hw-specific
controls. I've tested all 3 altsettings and the added switch
controls and they work as expected.

Note that this work is based on packet inspection with
usbmon. I just wanted to get this card to work for using
it on our open-source radio station:

v2 address issues reported by Takashi:
* Properly get/set enum type controls
* Prevent race condition on switch_get/set
* Various control naming changes
* Various coding style fixes

v3 improve readability of sample rate filtering
and some other minor changes.
