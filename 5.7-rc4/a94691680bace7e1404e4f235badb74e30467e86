efi/arm: Deal with ADR going out of range in efi_enter_kernel()

Commit

  0698fac4ac2a ("efi/arm: Clean EFI stub exit code from cache instead of avoiding it")

introduced a PC-relative reference to 'call_cache_fn' into
efi_enter_kernel(), which lives way at the end of head.S. In some cases,
the ARM version of the ADR instruction does not have sufficient range,
resulting in a build error:

  arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S:1453: Error: invalid constant (fffffffffffffbe4) after fixup

ARM defines an alternative with a wider range, called ADRL, but this does
not exist for Thumb-2. At the same time, the ADR instruction in Thumb-2
has a wider range, and so it does not suffer from the same issue.

So let's switch to ADRL for ARM builds, and keep the ADR for Thumb-2 builds.
