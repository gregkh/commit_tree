net: sched: Introduce ingress classification function

TC multi chain configuration can cause offloaded tc chains to miss in
hardware after jumping to some chain. In such cases the software should
continue from the chain that missed in hardware, as the hardware may
have manipulated the packet and updated some counters.

Currently a single tcf classification function serves both ingress and
egress. However, multi chain miss processing (get tc skb extension on
hw miss, set tc skb extension on tc miss) should happen only on
ingress.

Refactor the code to use ingress classification function, and move setting
the tc skb extension from general classification to it, as a prestep
for supporting the hw miss scenario.
