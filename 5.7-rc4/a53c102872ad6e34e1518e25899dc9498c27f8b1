vrf: Fix IPv6 with qdisc and xfrm

When a qdisc is attached to the VRF device, the packet goes down the ndo
xmit function which is setup to send the packet back to the VRF driver
which does a lookup to send the packet out. The lookup in the VRF driver
is not considering xfrm policies. Change it to use ip6_dst_lookup_flow
rather than ip6_route_output.
