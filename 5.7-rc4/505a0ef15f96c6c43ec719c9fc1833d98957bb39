kasan: stackdepot: move filter_irq_stacks() to stackdepot.c

filter_irq_stacks() can be used by other tools (e.g.  KMSAN), so it needs
to be moved to a common location.  lib/stackdepot.c seems a good place, as
filter_irq_stacks() is usually applied to the output of
stack_trace_save().

This patch has been previously mailed as part of KMSAN RFC patch series.
