powerpc/eeh: Make early EEH init pseries specific

The eeh_ops->probe() function is called from two different contexts:

1. On pseries, where we set EEH_PROBE_MODE_DEVTREE, it's called in
   eeh_add_device_early() which is supposed to run before we create
   a pci_dev.

2. On PowerNV, where we set EEH_PROBE_MODE_DEV, it's called in
   eeh_device_add_late() which is supposed to run *after* the
   pci_dev is created.

The "early" probe is required because PAPR requires that we perform an RTAS
call to enable EEH support on a device before we start interacting with it
via config space or MMIO. This requirement doesn't exist on PowerNV and
shoehorning two completely separate initialisation paths into a common
interface just results in a convoluted code everywhere.

Additionally the early probe requires the probe function to take an pci_dn
rather than a pci_dev argument. We'd like to make pci_dn a pseries specific
data structure since there's no real requirement for them on PowerNV. To
help both goals move the early probe into the pseries containment zone
so the platform depedence is more explicit.
