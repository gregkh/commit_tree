sched/fair: Update cpu_capacity to reflect thermal pressure

cpu_capacity initially reflects the maximum possible capacity of a CPU.
Thermal pressure on a CPU means this maximum possible capacity is
unavailable due to thermal events. This patch subtracts the average
thermal pressure for a CPU from its maximum possible capacity so that
cpu_capacity reflects the remaining maximum capacity.
