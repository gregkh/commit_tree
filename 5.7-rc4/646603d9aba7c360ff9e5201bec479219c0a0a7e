drm/i915/ehl: Ensure that the DDI selection MUX is programmed correctly

Perhaps in some cases the BIOS/GOP or other firmware may turn on
PHY A but may not program the MUX correctly. Therefore, re-program
PHY A if it is determined after reading the VBT that the value
programmed for the MUX bit does not match the expected value.
