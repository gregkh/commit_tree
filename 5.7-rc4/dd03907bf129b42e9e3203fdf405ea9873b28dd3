ASoC: soc-pcm: call snd_soc_component_open/close() once

Current soc_pcm_open() calls snd_soc_component_open() under loop.
Thus, it needs to care about opened/not-yet-opened Component.

But, if soc-component.c is handling it, soc-pcm.c don't need to care
about it.
This patch adds opened flag to soc-component.h, and simplify soc-pcm.c.
This is one of prepare for cleanup soc-pcm-open()
