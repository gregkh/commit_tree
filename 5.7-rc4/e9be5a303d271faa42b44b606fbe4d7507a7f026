btrfs: simplify tree block checksumming loop

Thw whole point of csum_tree_block is to iterate over all extent buffer
pages and pass it to checksumming functions. The bytes where checksum is
stored must be skipped, thus map_private_extent_buffer. This complicates
further offset calculations.

As the first page will be always present, checksum the relevant bytes
unconditionally and then do a simple iteration over the remaining pages.
