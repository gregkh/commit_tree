staging: vt6656: Fix pairwise key entry save.

The problem is that the group key was saved as VNT_KEY_DEFAULTKEY
was over written by the VNT_KEY_GROUP_ADDRESS index.

mac80211 could not clear the mac_addr in the default key.

The VNT_KEY_DEFAULTKEY is not necesscary so remove it and set as
VNT_KEY_GROUP_ADDRESS.

mac80211 can clear any key using vnt_mac_disable_keyentry.
