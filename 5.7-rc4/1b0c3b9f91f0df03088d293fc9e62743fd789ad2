ceph: re-org copy_file_range and fix some error paths

This patch re-organizes copy_file_range, trying to fix a few issues in the
error handling.  Here's the summary:

- Abort copy if initial do_splice_direct() returns fewer bytes than
  requested.

- Move the 'size' initialization (with i_size_read()) further down in the
  code, after the initial call to do_splice_direct().  This avoids issues
  with a possibly stale value if a manual copy is done.

- Move the object copy loop into a separate function.  This makes it
  easier to handle errors (e.g, dirtying caps and updating the MDS
  metadata if only some objects have been copied before an error has
  occurred).

- Added calls to ceph_oloc_destroy() to avoid leaking memory with src_oloc
  and dst_oloc

- After the object copy loop, the new file size to be reported to the MDS
  (if there's file size change) is now the actual file size, and not the
  size after an eventual extra manual copy.

- Added a few dout() to show the number of bytes copied in the two manual
  copies and in the object copy loop.
