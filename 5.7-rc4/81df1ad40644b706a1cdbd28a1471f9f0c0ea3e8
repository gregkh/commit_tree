exfat: truncate atimes to 2s granularity

The timestamp for access_time has double seconds granularity(There is no
10msIncrement field for access_time unlike create/modify_time).
exfat's atimes are restricted to only 2s granularity so after
we set an atime, round it down to the nearest 2s and set the
sub-second component of the timestamp to 0.
