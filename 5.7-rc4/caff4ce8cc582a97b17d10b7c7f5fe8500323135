ASoC: stm32: i2s: manage rebind issue

The commit e894efef9ac7 ("ASoC: core: add support to card rebind")
allows to rebind the sound card after a rebind of one of its component.
With this commit, the sound card is actually rebound,
but may be no more functional.

Corrections:
- Call snd_dmaengine_pcm_register() before snd_soc_register_component().
- Call snd_dmaengine_pcm_unregister() and snd_soc_unregister_component()
explicitly from I2S driver.
