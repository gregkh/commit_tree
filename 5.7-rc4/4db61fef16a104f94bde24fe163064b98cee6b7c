arm64: kvm: Modernize __smccc_workaround_1_smc_start annotations

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotation of assembly functions
in the kernel new macros have been introduced. These replace ENTRY and
ENDPROC with separate annotations for standard C callable functions,
data and code with different calling conventions.

Using these for __smccc_workaround_1_smc is more involved than for most
symbols as this symbol is annotated quite unusually, rather than just have
the explicit symbol we define _start and _end symbols which we then use to
compute the length. This does not play at all nicely with the new style
macros. Instead define a constant for the size of the function and use that
in both the C code and for .org based size checks in the assembly code.
