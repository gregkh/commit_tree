bpf: Add gso_size to __sk_buff

BPF programs may want to know whether an skb is gso. The canonical
answer is skb_is_gso(skb), which tests that gso_size != 0.

Expose this field in the same manner as gso_segs. That field itself
is not a sufficient signal, as the comment in skb_shared_info makes
clear: gso_segs may be zero, e.g., from dodgy sources.

Also prepare net/bpf/test_run for upcoming BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN tests
of the feature.
