powerpc/pmac/smp: Avoid unused-variable warnings

When building with ppc64_defconfig, the compiler reports
that these 2 variables are not used:
    warning: unused variable 'core99_l2_cache' [-Wunused-variable]
    warning: unused variable 'core99_l3_cache' [-Wunused-variable]

They are only used when CONFIG_PPC64 is not defined. Move
them into a section which does the same macro check.
