mei: limit number of bytes in mei header.

The MEI message header provides only 9 bits for storing
the message size, limiting to 511.
In theory the host buffer (hbuf) can contain up to 1020 bytes
(limited by byte =  255 * 4)
With the current hardware and hbuf size 512, this is not a real issue,
but as hardening approach we enforce the limit.
