rtw88: add a debugfs entry to enable/disable coex mechanism

Sometimes we need to stop the coex mechanism to debug, so that we
can manually control the device through various outer commands.
Hence, add a new debugfs coex_enable to allow us to enable/disable
the coex mechanism when driver is running.

To disable coex
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phyX/rtw88/coex_enable

To enable coex
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phyX/rtw88/coex_enable

To check coex dm is enabled or not
cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phyX/rtw88/coex_enable
