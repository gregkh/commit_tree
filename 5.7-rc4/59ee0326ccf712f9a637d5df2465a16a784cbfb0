rcutorture: Suppress forward-progress complaints during early boot

Some larger systems can take in excess of 50 seconds to complete their
early boot initcalls prior to spawing init.  This does not in any way
help the forward-progress judgments of built-in rcutorture (when
rcutorture is built as a module, the insmod or modprobe command normally
cannot happen until some time after boot completes).  This commit
therefore suppresses such complaints until about the time that init
is spawned.

This also includes a fix to a stupid error located by kbuild test robot.
