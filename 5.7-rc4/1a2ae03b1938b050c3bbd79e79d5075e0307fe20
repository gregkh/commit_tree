s390/ipl: add support to control memory clearing for FCP and CCW re-IPL

Re-IPL for both CCW and FCP is currently done by using diag 308 with the
"Load Clear" subcode, which means that all memory will be cleared.
This can increase re-IPL duration considerably on very large machines.

For CCW devices, there is also a "Load Normal" subcode that was only used
for dump kernels so far. For FCP devices, a similar "Load Normal" subcode
was introduced with z14. The "Load Normal" diag 308 subcode allows to
re-IPL without clearing memory.

This patch adds a new "clear" sysfs attribute to /sys/firmware/reipl for
both the ccw and fcp subdirectories, which can be set to either "0" or "1"
to disable or enable re-IPL with memory clearing. The default value is "0",
which disables memory clearing.
