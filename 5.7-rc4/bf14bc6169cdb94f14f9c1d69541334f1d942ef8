arm64: dts: rockchip: fix compatible property for rk3399-evb

A test with the command below gives this error:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-evb.dt.yaml: /: compatible:
['rockchip,rk3399-evb', 'rockchip,rk3399', 'google,rk3399evb-rev2']
is not valid under any of the given schemas

'google,rk3399evb-rev2' was a no longer used variant for Google.
The binding only mentions 'rockchip,rk3399-evb', 'rockchip,rk3399',
so fix this error by removing 'google,rk3399evb-rev2' from
the compatible property in rk3399-evb.dts and change it into
generic rk3399-evb support only.
