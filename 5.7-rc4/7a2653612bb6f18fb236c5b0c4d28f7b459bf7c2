s390/gmap: return proper error code on ksm unsharing

If a signal is pending we might return -ENOMEM instead of -EINTR.
We should propagate the proper error during KSM unsharing.
unmerge_ksm_pages returns -ERESTARTSYS on signal_pending. This gets
translated by entry.S to -EINTR. It is important to get this error
code so that userspace can retry.

To make this clearer we also add -EINTR to the documentation of the
PV_ENABLE call, which calls unmerge_ksm_pages.
