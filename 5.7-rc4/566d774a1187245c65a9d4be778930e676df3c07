mm: introduce page_ref_sub_return()

An upcoming patch requires subtracting a large chunk of refcounts from a
page, and checking what the resulting refcount is.  This is a little
different than the usual "check for zero refcount" that many of the page
ref functions already do.  However, it is similar to a few other routines
that (like this one) are generally useful for things such as 1-based
refcounting.

Add page_ref_sub_return(), that subtracts a chunk of refcounts atomically,
and returns an atomic snapshot of the result.
