arm64: kvm: Modernize annotation for __bp_harden_hyp_vecs

We have recently introduced new macros for annotating assembly symbols
for things that aren't C functions, SYM_CODE_START() and SYM_CODE_END(),
in an effort to clarify and simplify our annotations of assembly files.

Using these for __bp_harden_hyp_vecs is more involved than for most symbols
as this symbol is annotated quite unusually as rather than just have the
explicit symbol we define _start and _end symbols which we then use to
compute the length. This does not play at all nicely with the new style
macros. Since the size of the vectors is a known constant which won't vary
the simplest thing to do is simply to drop the separate _start and _end
symbols and just use a #define for the size.
