drivers: thermal: tsens: Add watchdog support

TSENS IP v2.3 onwards adds support for a watchdog to detect if the TSENS
HW FSM is stuck. Add support to detect and restart the FSM in the
driver. The watchdog is configured by the bootloader, we just enable the
watchdog bark as a debug feature in the kernel.
