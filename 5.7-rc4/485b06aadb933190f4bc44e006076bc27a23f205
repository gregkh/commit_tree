media: stv06xx: add missing descriptor sanity checks

Make sure to check that we have two alternate settings and at least one
endpoint before accessing the second altsetting structure and
dereferencing the endpoint arrays.

This specifically avoids dereferencing NULL-pointers or corrupting
memory when a device does not have the expected descriptors.

Note that the sanity checks in stv06xx_start() and pb0100_start() are
not redundant as the driver is mixing looking up altsettings by index
and by number, which may not coincide.
