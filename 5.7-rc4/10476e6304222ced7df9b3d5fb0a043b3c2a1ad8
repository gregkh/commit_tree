locking/lockdep: Fix bad recursion pattern

There were two patterns for lockdep_recursion:

Pattern-A:
	if (current->lockdep_recursion)
		return

	current->lockdep_recursion = 1;
	/* do stuff */
	current->lockdep_recursion = 0;

Pattern-B:
	current->lockdep_recursion++;
	/* do stuff */
	current->lockdep_recursion--;

But a third pattern has emerged:

Pattern-C:
	current->lockdep_recursion = 1;
	/* do stuff */
	current->lockdep_recursion = 0;

And while this isn't broken per-se, it is highly dangerous because it
doesn't nest properly.

Get rid of all Pattern-C instances and shore up Pattern-A with a
warning.
