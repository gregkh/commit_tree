KVM: x86: Handle INVPCID CPUID adjustment in VMX code

Move the INVPCID CPUID adjustments into VMX to eliminate an instance of
the undesirable "unsigned f_* = *_supported ? F(*) : 0" pattern in the
common CPUID handling code.  Drop ->invpcid_supported(), CPUID
adjustment was the only user.

No functional change intended.
