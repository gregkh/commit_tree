bpf: JIT helpers for fmod_ret progs

* Split the invoke_bpf program to prepare for special handling of
  fmod_ret programs introduced in a subsequent patch.
* Move the definition of emit_cond_near_jump and emit_nops as they are
  needed for fmod_ret.
* Refactor branch target alignment into its own generic helper function
  i.e. emit_align.
