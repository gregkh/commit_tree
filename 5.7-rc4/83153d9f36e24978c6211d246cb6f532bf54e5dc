PCI: endpoint: Fix ->set_msix() to take BIR and offset as arguments

commit 8963106eabdc ("PCI: endpoint: Add MSI-X interfaces") while
adding support to raise MSI-X interrupts from endpoint didn't include
BAR Indicator register (BIR) configuration and MSI-X table offset as
arguments in pci_epc_set_msix(). This would result in endpoint
controller register using random BAR indicator register, the memory
for which might not be allocated by the endpoint function driver.
Add BAR indicator register and MSI-X table offset as arguments in
pci_epc_set_msix() and allocate space for MSI-X table and pending
bit array (PBA) in pci-epf-test endpoint function driver.
