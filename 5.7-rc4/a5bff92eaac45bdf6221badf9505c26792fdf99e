dma-buf: Fix SET_NAME ioctl uapi

The uapi is the same on 32 and 64 bit, but the number isn't. Everyone
who botched this please re-read:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.4-preprc-cpu/ioctl/botching-up-ioctls.html

Also, the type argument for the ioctl macros is for the type the void
__user *arg pointer points at, which in this case would be the
variable-sized char[] of a 0 terminated string. So this was botched in
more than just the usual ways.
