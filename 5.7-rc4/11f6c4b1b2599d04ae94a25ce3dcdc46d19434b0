drm/bridge: Add connector-related bridge operations and data

To support implementation of DRM connectors on top of DRM bridges
instead of by bridges, the drm_bridge needs to expose new operations and
data:

- Output detection, hot-plug notification, mode retrieval and EDID
  retrieval operations
- Bitmask of supported operations
- Bridge output type
- I2C adapter for DDC access

Add and document these.

Three new bridge helper functions are also added to handle hot plug
notification in a way that is as transparent as possible for the
bridges.
