s390: remove broken hibernate / power management support

Hibernation is known to be broken for many years on s390. Given that
there aren't any real use cases, remove the code instead of spending
time to fix and maintain it.

Without hibernate support it doesn't make too much sense to keep power
management support; therefore remove it completely.
