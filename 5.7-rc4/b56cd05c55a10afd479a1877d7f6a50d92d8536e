x86/mm: Rename is_kernel_text to __is_kernel_text

The kbuild test robot reported compile issue on x86 in one of
the following patches that adds <linux/kallsyms.h> include into
<linux/bpf.h>, which is picked up by init_32.c object.

The problem is that <linux/kallsyms.h> defines global function
is_kernel_text which colides with the static function of the
same name defined in init_32.c:

  $ make ARCH=i386
  ...
  >> arch/x86/mm/init_32.c:241:19: error: redefinition of 'is_kernel_text'
    static inline int is_kernel_text(unsigned long addr)
                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   include/linux/kallsyms.h:31:19: note: previous definition of 'is_kernel_text' was here
    static inline int is_kernel_text(unsigned long addr)

Renaming the init_32.c is_kernel_text function to __is_kernel_text.
