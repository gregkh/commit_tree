hwmon: (jc42) Fix name to have no illegal characters

The jc42 driver passes I2C client's name as hwmon device name. In case
of device tree probed devices this ends up being part of the compatible
string, "jc-42.4-temp". This name contains hyphens and the hwmon core
doesn't like this:

jc42 2-0018: hwmon: 'jc-42.4-temp' is not a valid name attribute, please fix

This changes the name to "jc42" which doesn't have any illegal
characters.
