i2c: tegra: Better handle case where CPU0 is busy for a long time

Boot CPU0 always handle I2C interrupt and under some rare circumstances
(like running KASAN + NFS root) it may stuck in uninterruptible state for
a significant time. In this case we will get timeout if I2C transfer is
running on a sibling CPU, despite of IRQ being raised. In order to handle
this rare condition, the IRQ status needs to be checked after completion
timeout.
