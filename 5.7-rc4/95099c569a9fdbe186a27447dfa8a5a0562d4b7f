r8169: change back SG and TSO to be disabled by default

There has been a number of reports that using SG/TSO on different chip
versions results in tx timeouts. However for a lot of people SG/TSO
works fine. Therefore disable both features by default, but allow users
to enable them. Use at own risk!
