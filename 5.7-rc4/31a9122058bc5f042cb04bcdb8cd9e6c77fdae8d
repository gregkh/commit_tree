x86/mm: Drop pud_mknotpresent()

There is an inconsistency between PMD and PUD-based THP page table helpers
like the following, as pud_present() does not test for _PAGE_PSE.

pmd_present(pmd_mknotpresent(pmd)) : True
pud_present(pud_mknotpresent(pud)) : False

Drop pud_mknotpresent() as there are no current users. If/when needed
back later, pud_present() will also have to be fixed to accommodate
_PAGE_PSE.
