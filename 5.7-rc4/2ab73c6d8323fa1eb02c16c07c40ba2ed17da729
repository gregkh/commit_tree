gpio: Support GPIO controllers without pin-ranges

Wake gpiochip_generic_request() call into the pinctrl helpers only if a
GPIO controller had any pin-ranges assigned to it. This allows a driver
to unconditionally use this helper if it supports multiple devices of
which only a subset have pin-ranges assigned to them.
