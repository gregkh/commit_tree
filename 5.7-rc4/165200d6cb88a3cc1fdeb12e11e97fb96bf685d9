follow_dotdot(): be lazy about changing nd->path

Change nd->path only after the loop is done and only in case we hadn't
ended up finding ourselves in root.  Same for NO_XDEV check.

That separates the "check how far back do we need to go through the
mount stack" logics from the rest of .. traversal.

NOTE: path_get/path_put introduced here are temporary.  They will
go away later in the series.
