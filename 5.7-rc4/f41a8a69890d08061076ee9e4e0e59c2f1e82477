drm/mipi_dbi: Add support for display offsets

If the resolution of the TFT display is smaller than the maximum
resolution supported by the display controller, the display may be
connected to the driver output arrays with a horizontal and/or vertical
offset, leading to a shifted image.

Add support for specifying these offsets.
