clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Enable autoreload in set_pwm

dm timer ops set_load() api allows to configure the load value and to
set the auto reload feature. But auto reload feature is independent of
load value and should be part of configuring pwm. This way pwm can be
disabled by disabling auto reload feature using set_pwm() so that the
current pwm cycle will be completed. Else pwm disabling causes the
cycle to be stopped abruptly.
