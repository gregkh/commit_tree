bpf: Update locking comment in hashtab code

The comment where the bucket lock is acquired says:

  /* bpf_map_update_elem() can be called in_irq() */

which is not really helpful and aside of that it does not explain the
subtle details of the hash bucket locks expecially in the context of BPF
and perf, kprobes and tracing.

Add a comment at the top of the file which explains the protection scopes
and the details how potential deadlocks are prevented.
