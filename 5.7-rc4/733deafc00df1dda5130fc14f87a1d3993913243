KVM: x86: Handle RDTSCP CPUID adjustment in VMX code

Move the clearing of the RDTSCP CPUID bit into VMX, which has a separate
VMCS control to enable RDTSCP in non-root, to eliminate an instance of
the undesirable "unsigned f_* = *_supported ? F(*) : 0" pattern in the
common CPUID handling code.  Drop ->rdtscp_supported() since CPUID
adjustment was the last remaining user.

No functional change intended.
