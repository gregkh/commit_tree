x86/pkeys: Add check for pkey "overflow"

Alex Shi reported the pkey macros above arch_set_user_pkey_access()
to be unused.  They are unused, and even refer to a nonexistent
CONFIG option.

But, they might have served a good use, which was to ensure that
the code does not try to set values that would not fit in the
PKRU register.  As it stands, a too-large 'pkey' value would
be likely to silently overflow the u32 new_pkru_bits.

Add a check to look for overflows.  Also add a comment to remind
any future developer to closely examine the types used to store
pkey values if arch_max_pkey() ever changes.

This boots and passes the x86 pkey selftests.
