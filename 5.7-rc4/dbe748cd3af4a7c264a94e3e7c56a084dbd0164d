drm/i915/tgl: Don't treat unslice registers as masked

The UNSLICE_UNIT_LEVEL_CLKGATE and UNSLICE_UNIT_LEVEL_CLKGATE2 registers
that we update in a few engine workarounds are not masked registers
(i.e., we don't have to write a mask bit in the top 16 bits when
updating one of the lower 16 bits).  As such, these workarounds should
be applied via wa_write_or() rather than wa_masked_en()

v2:
 - Rebase
