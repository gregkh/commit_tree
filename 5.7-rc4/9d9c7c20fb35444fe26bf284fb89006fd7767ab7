scsi: pm80xx: Free the tag when mpi_set_phy_profile_resp is received

In pm80xx driver, the command mpi_set_phy_profile_req is sent by host
during boot to configure the phy profile such as analog setting page, rate
control page. However, the tag is not freed when its response is
received. As a result, 16 tags are missing for each HBA after boot.  When
NCQ is enabled with queue depth 16, it needs at least, 15 * 16 = 240 tags
for each HBA to achieve the best performance. In current pm80xx driver with
setting CCB_MAX = 256, the total number of tags in each HBA is 255 for data
IO. Hence, without returning those tags to the pool after boot, some device
will finally be forced to non-ncq mode by ATA layer due to excessive errors
(i.e. LLDD cannot allocate tag for queued task).
