ALSA: via82xx: Fix endianness annotations

The internal page tables are in little endian, hence they should be
__le32 type.  This fixes the relevant sparse warnings:
  sound/pci/via82xx.c:454:60: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
  sound/pci/via82xx.c:454:60:    expected unsigned int [usertype]
  sound/pci/via82xx.c:454:60:    got restricted __le32 [usertype]
  ....

No functional changes, just sparse warning fixes.
