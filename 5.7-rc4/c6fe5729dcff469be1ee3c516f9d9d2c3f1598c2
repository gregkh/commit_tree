net/mlx5e: en_rep: Create uplink rep root table after eswitch offloads table

The eswitch offloads table, which has the reps (vport) rx miss rules,
was moved from OFFLOADS namespace [0,0] (prio, level), to [1,0], so
the restore table (the new [0,0]) can come before it. The destinations
of these miss rules is the rep root ft (ttc for non uplink reps).

Uplink rep root ft is created as OFFLOADS namespace [0,1], and is used
as a hook to next RX prio (either ethtool or ttc), but this fails to
pass fs_core level's check.

Move uplink rep root ft to OFFLOADS prio 1, level 1 ([1,1]), so it
will keep the same relative position after the restore table
change.
