ASoC: wsa881x: mark read_only_wordlength flag

WSA881x works in PDM mode so the wordlength is fixed, which also makes
the only field "WordLength" in DPN_BlockCtrl1 register a read-only.
Writing to this register will throw up errors with Qualcomm Controller.
So use ro_blockctrl1_reg flag to mark this field as read-only so that
core will not write to this register.
