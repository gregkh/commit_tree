cxgb4: fix adapter crash due to wrong MC size

In the absence of MC1, the size calculation function
cudbg_mem_region_size() was returing wrong MC size and
resulted in adapter crash. This patch adds new argument
to cudbg_mem_region_size() which will have actual size
and returns error to caller in the absence of MC1.
