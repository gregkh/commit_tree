irqchip/gic-v4.1: Plumb skeletal VSGI irqchip

Since GICv4.1 has the capability to inject 16 SGIs into each VPE,
and that I'm keen not to invent too many specific interfaces to
manipulate these interrupts, let's pretend that each of these SGIs
is an actual Linux interrupt.

For that matter, let's introduce a minimal irqchip and irqdomain
setup that will get fleshed up in the following patches.
