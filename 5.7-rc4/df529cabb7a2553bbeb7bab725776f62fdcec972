mm: mmap: add trace point of vm_unmapped_area

Even on 64 bit kernel, the mmap failure can happen for a 32 bit task.
Virtual memory space shortage of a task on mmap is reported to userspace
as -ENOMEM.  It can be confused as physical memory shortage of overall
system.

The vm_unmapped_area can be called to by some drivers or other kernel core
system like filesystem.  In my platform, GPU driver calls to
vm_unmapped_area and the driver returns -ENOMEM even in GPU side shortage.
It can be hard to distinguish which code layer returns the -ENOMEM.

Create mmap trace file and add trace point of vm_unmapped_area.

i.e.)
277.156599: vm_unmapped_area: addr=77e0d03000 err=0 total_vm=0x17014b flags=0x1 len=0x400000 lo=0x8000 hi=0x7878c27000 mask=0x0 ofs=0x1
342.838740: vm_unmapped_area: addr=0 err=-12 total_vm=0xffb08 flags=0x0 len=0x100000 lo=0x40000000 hi=0xfffff000 mask=0x0 ofs=0x22
