bus: ti-sysc: Consider non-existing registers too when matching quirks

We are currently setting -1 for non-existing sysconfig related registers
for quirks, but setting -ENODEV elsewhere. And for matching the quirks,
we're now just ignoring the non-existing registers. This will cause issues
with misdetecting DSS registers as the hardware revision numbers can have
duplicates.

To avoid this, let's standardize on using -ENODEV also for the quirks
instead of -1. That way we can always just test for a match without adding
any more complicated logic.
