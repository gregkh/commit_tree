scsi: ufs: ufs-mediatek: ensure UniPro is not powered down before linkup

MediaTek Chipsets can enter proprietary UniPro low-power mode during
suspend while link is in hibern8 state. Make sure leaving low-power mode
before every link startup to prevent lockup in any possible error recovery
path.

At the same time, re-factor related funcitons to improve code readability.
