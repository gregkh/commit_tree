arm64: use activity monitors for frequency invariance

The Frequency Invariance Engine (FIE) is providing a frequency
scaling correction factor that helps achieve more accurate
load-tracking.

So far, for arm and arm64 platforms, this scale factor has been
obtained based on the ratio between the current frequency and the
maximum supported frequency recorded by the cpufreq policy. The
setting of this scale factor is triggered from cpufreq drivers by
calling arch_set_freq_scale. The current frequency used in computation
is the frequency requested by a governor, but it may not be the
frequency that was implemented by the platform.

This correction factor can also be obtained using a core counter and a
constant counter to get information on the performance (frequency based
only) obtained in a period of time. This will more accurately reflect
the actual current frequency of the CPU, compared with the alternative
implementation that reflects the request of a performance level from
the OS.

Therefore, implement arch_scale_freq_tick to use activity monitors, if
present, for the computation of the frequency scale factor.

The use of AMU counters depends on:
 - CONFIG_ARM64_AMU_EXTN - depents on the AMU extension being present
 - CONFIG_CPU_FREQ - the current frequency obtained using counter
   information is divided by the maximum frequency obtained from the
   cpufreq policy.

While it is possible to have a combination of CPUs in the system with
and without support for activity monitors, the use of counters for
frequency invariance is only enabled for a CPU if all related CPUs
(CPUs in the same frequency domain) support and have enabled the core
and constant activity monitor counters. In this way, there is a clear
separation between the policies for which arch_set_freq_scale (cpufreq
based FIE) is used, and the policies for which arch_scale_freq_tick
(counter based FIE) is used to set the frequency scale factor. For
this purpose, a late_initcall_sync is registered to trigger validation
work for policies that will enable or disable the use of AMU counters
for frequency invariance. If CONFIG_CPU_FREQ is not defined, the use
of counters is enabled on all CPUs only if all possible CPUs correctly
support the necessary counters.
