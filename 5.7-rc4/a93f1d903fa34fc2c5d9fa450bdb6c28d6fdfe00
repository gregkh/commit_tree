irqchip: Add driver for Loongson-3 HyperTransport PIC controller

This controller appeared on Loongson-3 family of chips to receive
interrupts from PCH PIC.
It is a I8259 with optimized interrupt polling flow. We can poll
interrupt number from HT vector directly but still have to follow
standard I8259 routines to mask, unmask and EOI.
