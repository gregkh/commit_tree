xarray: Fix early termination of xas_for_each_marked

xas_for_each_marked() is using entry == NULL as a termination condition
of the iteration. When xas_for_each_marked() is used protected only by
RCU, this can however race with xas_store(xas, NULL) in the following
way:

TASK1                                   TASK2
page_cache_delete()         	        find_get_pages_range_tag()
                                          xas_for_each_marked()
                                            xas_find_marked()
                                              off = xas_find_chunk()

  xas_store(&xas, NULL)
    xas_init_marks(&xas);
    ...
    rcu_assign_pointer(*slot, NULL);
                                              entry = xa_entry(off);

And thus xas_for_each_marked() terminates prematurely possibly leading
to missed entries in the iteration (translating to missing writeback of
some pages or a similar problem).

If we find a NULL entry that has been marked, skip it (unless we're trying
to allocate an entry).
