drm: panel: fix excessive stack usage in td028ttec1_prepare

With gcc -O3 in combination with the structleak plug, the compiler can
inline very aggressively, leading to rather large stack usage:

drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-tpo-td028ttec1.c: In function 'td028ttec1_prepare':
drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-tpo-td028ttec1.c:233:1: error: the frame size of 2768 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
 }

Marking jbt_reg_write_*() as noinline avoids the case where
multiple instances of this function get inlined into the same
stack frame and each one adds a copy of 'tx_buf'.

The compiler is clearly making some bad decisions here, but I
did not open a new bug report as this only happens in combination
with the structleak plugin.

This fixes mmtom ("init/Kconfig: enable -O3 for all arches")
