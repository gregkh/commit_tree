bpf/trace: Remove redundant preempt_disable from trace_call_bpf()

Similar to __bpf_trace_run this is redundant because __bpf_trace_run() is
invoked from a trace point via __DO_TRACE() which already disables
preemption _before_ invoking any of the functions which are attached to a
trace point.

Remove it and add a cant_sleep() check.
