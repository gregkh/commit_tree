KVM: LAPIC: Recalculate apic map in batch

In the vCPU reset and set APIC_BASE MSR path, the apic map will be recalculated
several times, each time it will consume 10+ us observed by ftrace in my
non-overcommit environment since the expensive memory allocate/mutex/rcu etc
operations. This patch optimizes it by recaluating apic map in batch, I hope
this can benefit the serverless scenario which can frequently create/destroy
VMs.

Before patch:

kvm_lapic_reset  ~27us

After patch:

kvm_lapic_reset  ~14us

Observed by ftrace, improve ~48%.
