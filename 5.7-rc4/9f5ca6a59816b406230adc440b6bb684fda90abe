mptcp: fix 'Attempt to release TCP socket in state' warnings

We need to set sk_state to CLOSED, else we will get following:

IPv4: Attempt to release TCP socket in state 3 00000000b95f109e
IPv4: Attempt to release TCP socket in state 10 00000000b95f109e

First one is from inet_sock_destruct(), second one from
mptcp_sk_clone failure handling.  Setting sk_state to CLOSED isn't
enough, we also need to orphan sk so it has DEAD flag set.
Otherwise, a very similar warning is printed from inet_sock_destruct().
