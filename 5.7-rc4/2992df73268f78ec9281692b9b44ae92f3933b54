btrfs: Implement DREW lock

A (D)ouble (R)eader (W)riter (E)xclustion lock is a locking primitive
that allows to have multiple readers or multiple writers but not
multiple readers and writers holding it concurrently.

The code is factored out from the existing open-coded locking scheme
used to exclude pending snapshots from nocow writers and vice-versa.
Current implementation actually favors Readers (that is snapshot
creaters) to writers (nocow writers of the filesystem).

The API provides lock/unlock/trylock for reads and writes.

Formal specification for TLA+ provided by Valentin Schneider is at
