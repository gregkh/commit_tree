drm/amd/display: update connector->display_info after read edid

[Why]
drm_connector->display_info is not passed to amdgpu_dm right way after
read edid.

[How]
display_info is parsed from edid and saved into drm_connector by
drm_connector_update_edid_proerty which is called within
amdgpu_dm_update_connector_after_detect. call this function after read
edid to update drm_connector->display_info
