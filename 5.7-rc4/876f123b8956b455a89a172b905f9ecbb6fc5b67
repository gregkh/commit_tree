media: meson: vdec: bring up to compliance

Add all the necessary bits to pass v4l2-compliance in stateful decoding
mode.

Mostly includes tracking the state of the decoder, allowing the OUTPUT
queue to stream while the CAPTURE queue is inactive, handling resolution
change events, draining with V4L2_DEC_CMD_STOP, copying more metadata
from the src buffers to the dst buffers, etc.
