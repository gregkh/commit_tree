KVM: x86: Consolidate VM allocation and free for VMX and SVM

Move the VM allocation and free code to common x86 as the logic is
more or less identical across SVM and VMX.

Note, although hyperv.hv_pa_pg is part of the common kvm->arch, it's
(currently) only allocated by VMX VMs.  But, since kfree() plays nice
when passed a NULL pointer, the superfluous call for SVM is harmless
and avoids future churn if SVM gains support for HyperV's direct TLB
flush.
