i2c: convert SMBus alert setup function to return an ERRPTR

Only few drivers use this call, so drivers and I2C core are converted at
once with this patch. By simply using i2c_new_client_device() instead of
i2c_new_device(), we easily can return an ERRPTR for this function as
well. To make out of tree users aware that something changed, the
function is renamed to i2c_new_smbus_alert_device().
