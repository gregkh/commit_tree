media: staging: rkisp1: rsz: don't ignore set format in bayer mainpath

Fix issue when, in case of raw bayer format in mainpath,
VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT ioctl didn't have any effect, is wasn't updating the
format of the pad.

There is no crop for mainpath bayer raw data. Remove leftover check in
set_format, since check is already done in crop rkisp1_rsz_set_sink_crop()
function.
