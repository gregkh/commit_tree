irqchip/gic-v4.1: Skip absent CPUs while iterating over redistributors

In a system that is only sparsly populated with CPUs, we can end-up with
redistributors structures that are not initialized. Let's make sure we
don't try and access those when iterating over them (in this case when
checking we have a L2 VPE table).
