Bluetooth: hci_qca: Bug fixes while collecting controller memory dump

This patch will fix the below issues
 1. Discarding memory dump events if memdump state is moved to
    MEMDUMP_TIMEOUT.
 2. Fixed race conditions between qca_hw_error() and qca_controller_memdump
    while free memory dump buffers using mutex lock
 3. Moved timeout timer to delayed work queue
 4. Injecting HW error event in a case when dumps failed to receive and HW
    error event is not yet received.
 5. Clearing hw error and command timeout function callbacks before
    sending pre shutdown command.

 Collecting memory dump will follow any of the below sequence.

 Sequence 1:
   Receiving Memory dump events from the controller
   Received entire dump in stipulated time
   Received HW error event from the controller
   Controller Reset from HOST

 Sequence 2:
   Receiving Memory dump events from the controller
   Failed to Receive entire dump in stipulated time
   A Timeout schedules and if no HW error event received a fake HW
     error event will be injected.
   Controller Reset from HOST.

 Sequence 3:
   Received HW error event
   HOST trigger SSR by sending crash packet to controller.
   Received entire dump in stipulated time
   Controller Reset from HOST
