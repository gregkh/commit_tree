drm/i915: Clear old hw.fb & co. from slave plane's state

Let's do the intel_plane_copy_uapi_to_hw_state() before we bail out
due to both old and new uapi.crtc being NULL. This will drop the
reference to the old hw.fb for planes that are transitioning from
being a slave plane to simply being disabled.
