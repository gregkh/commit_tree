tcp_bpf: Don't let child socket inherit parent protocol ops on copy

Prepare for cloning listening sockets that have their protocol callbacks
overridden by sk_msg. Child sockets must not inherit parent callbacks that
access state stored in sk_user_data owned by the parent.

Restore the child socket protocol callbacks before it gets hashed and any
of the callbacks can get invoked.
