net: axienet: Wrap DMA pointer writes to prepare for 64 bit

Newer versions of the Xilink DMA IP support busses with more than 32
address bits, by introducing an MSB word for the registers holding DMA
pointers (tail/current, RX/TX descriptor addresses).
On IP configured for more than 32 bits, it is also *required* to write
both words, to let the IP recognise this as a start condition for an
MM2S request, for instance.

Wrap the DMA pointer writes with a separate function, to add this
functionality later. For now we stick to the lower 32 bits.
