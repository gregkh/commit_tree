drm/i915/dp/tgl+: Update combo phy vswing tables

TGL has now a table for RBR and HBR and another table for HBR2 over
combo phys. The HBR2 one has some small changes comparing to the ICL
one, so adding two new tables and adding a function to return TGL
combo phy tables.

v2:
- reordered the tgl_combo_phy_ddi_translations_dp_hbr2 to reduce diff
(Matt)
- removed definition of rates, kept using raw number(Jani and Ville)
- changed code to use icl_get_combo_buf_trans() for non-DP as those
are equal between TGL and ICL(Matt)
