ALSA: usb-audio: Apply async workaround for Scarlett 2i4 2nd gen

Due to rounding error driver sometimes incorrectly calculate next packet
size, which results in audible clicks on devices with synchronous playback
endpoints. For example on a high speed bus and a sample rate 44.1 kHz it
loses one sample every ~40.9 seconds. Fortunately playback interface on
Scarlett 2i4 2nd gen has a working explicit feedback endpoint, so we can
switch playback data endpoint to asynchronous mode as a workaround.
