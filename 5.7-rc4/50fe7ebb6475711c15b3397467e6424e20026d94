bpf, x86_32: Fix clobbering of dst for BPF_JSET

The current JIT clobbers the destination register for BPF_JSET BPF_X
and BPF_K by using "and" and "or" instructions. This is fine when the
destination register is a temporary loaded from a register stored on
the stack but not otherwise.

This patch fixes the problem (for both BPF_K and BPF_X) by always loading
the destination register into temporaries since BPF_JSET should not
modify the destination register.

This bug may not be currently triggerable as BPF_REG_AX is the only
register not stored on the stack and the verifier uses it in a limited
way.
