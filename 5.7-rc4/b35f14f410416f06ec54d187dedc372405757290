libbpf: Split BTF presence checks into libbpf- and kernel-specific parts

Needs for application BTF being present differs between user-space libbpf needs and kernel
needs. Currently, BTF is mandatory only in kernel only when BPF application is
using STRUCT_OPS. While libbpf itself relies more heavily on presense of BTF:
  - for BTF-defined maps;
  - for Kconfig externs;
  - for STRUCT_OPS as well.

Thus, checks for presence and validness of bpf_object's BPF needs to be
performed separately, which is patch does.
