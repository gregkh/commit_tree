KVM: Drop largepages_enabled and its accessor/mutator

Drop largepages_enabled, kvm_largepages_enabled() and
kvm_disable_largepages() now that all users are gone.

Note, largepages_enabled was an x86-only flag that got left in common
KVM code when KVM gained support for multiple architectures.

No functional change intended.
