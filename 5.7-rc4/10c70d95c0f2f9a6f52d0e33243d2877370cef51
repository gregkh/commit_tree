block: remove the bd_openers checks in blk_drop_partitions

When replacing the bd_super check with a bd_openers I followed a logical
conclusion, which turns out to be utterly wrong.  When a block device has
bd_super sets it has a mount file system on it (although not every
mounted file system sets bd_super), but that also implies it doesn't even
have partitions to start with.

So instead of trying to come up with a logical check for all openers,
just remove the check entirely.
