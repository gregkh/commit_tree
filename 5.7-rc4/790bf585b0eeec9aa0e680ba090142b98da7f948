selftests/resctrl: Add Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) selftest

Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) selftest allocates a portion of
last level cache and starts a benchmark to read each cache
line in this portion of cache. Measure the cache misses in perf and
the misses should be equal to the number of cache lines in this
portion of cache.

We don't use CQM to calculate cache usage because some CAT enabled
platforms don't have CQM.
