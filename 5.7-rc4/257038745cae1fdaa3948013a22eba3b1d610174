KVM: x86: Move nSVM CPUID 0x8000000A handling into common x86 code

Handle CPUID 0x8000000A in the main switch in __do_cpuid_func() and drop
->set_supported_cpuid() now that both VMX and SVM implementations are
empty.  Like leaf 0x14 (Intel PT) and leaf 0x8000001F (SEV), leaf
0x8000000A is is (obviously) vendor specific but can be queried in
common code while respecting SVM's wishes by querying kvm_cpu_cap_has().
