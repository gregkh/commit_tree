c6x: Replace setup_irq() by request_irq()

request_irq() is preferred over setup_irq(). Invocations of setup_irq()
occur after memory allocators are ready.

setup_irq() was required in older kernels as the memory allocator was not
available during early boot.

Hence replace setup_irq() by request_irq().
