dmaengine: Add basic debugfs support

Via the /sys/kernel/debug/dmaengine/summary users can get information
about the DMA devices and the used channels.

Example output on am654-evm with audio using two channels and after running
dmatest on 4 channels:

dma0 (285c0000.dma-controller): number of channels: 96

dma1 (31150000.dma-controller): number of channels: 267
 dma1chan0    | 2b00000.mcasp:tx
 dma1chan1    | 2b00000.mcasp:rx
 dma1chan2    | in-use
 dma1chan3    | in-use
 dma1chan4    | in-use
 dma1chan5    | in-use

For slave channels we can show the device and the channel name a given
channel is requested.
For non slave devices the only information we know is that the channel is
in use.

DMA drivers can implement the optional dbg_summary_show callback to
provide controller specific information instead of the generic one.

It is easy to extend the generic dmaengine_summary_show() to print
additional information about the used channels.

I have taken the idea from gpiolib and clk subsystems.
