mm/hmm: add missing unmaps of the ptep during hmm_vma_handle_pte()

Many of the direct returns of error skipped doing the pte_unmap(). All non
zero exit paths must unmap the pte.

The pte_unmap() is split unnaturally like this because some of the error
exit paths trigger a sleep and must release the lock before sleeping.

Fixes: 53f5c3f489ec ("mm/hmm: factor out pte and pmd handling to simplify hmm_vma_walk_pmd()")
