bpf: Allow to retrieve cgroup v1 classid from v2 hooks

Today, Kubernetes is still operating on cgroups v1, however, it is
possible to retrieve the task's classid based on 'current' out of
connect(), sendmsg(), recvmsg() and bind-related hooks for orchestrators
which attach to the root cgroup v2 hook in a mixed env like in case
of Cilium, for example, in order to then correlate certain pod traffic
and use it as part of the key for BPF map lookups.
