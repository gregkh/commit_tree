io_uring: don't call work.func from sync ctx

Many operations define custom work.func before getting into an io-wq.
There are several points against:
- it calls io_wq_assign_next() from outside io-wq, that may be confusing
- sync context would go unnecessary through io_req_cancelled()
- prototypes are quite different, so work!=old_work looks strange
- makes async/sync responsibilities fuzzy
- adds extra overhead

Don't call generic path and io-wq handlers from each other, but use
helpers instead
