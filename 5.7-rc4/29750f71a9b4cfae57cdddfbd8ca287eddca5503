hugetlb_cgroup: add hugetlb_cgroup reservation tests

The tests use both shared and private mapped hugetlb memory, and monitors
the hugetlb usage counter as well as the hugetlb reservation counter.
They test different configurations such as hugetlb memory usage via
hugetlbfs, or MAP_HUGETLB, or shmget/shmat, and with and without
MAP_POPULATE.

Also add test for hugetlb reservation reparenting, since this is a subtle
issue.
