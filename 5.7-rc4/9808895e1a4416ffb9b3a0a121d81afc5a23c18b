mm/hugetlb_cgroup: fix hugetlb_cgroup migration

Commit c32300516047 ("hugetlb_cgroup: add interface for charge/uncharge
hugetlb reservations") mistakingly doesn't handle the migration of *both*
the reservation hugetlb_cgroup and the fault hugetlb_cgroup correctly.

What should happen is that both cgroups shuold be queried from the old
page, then both set to NULL on the old page, then both inserted into the
new page.

The mistake also creates the following warning:

mm/hugetlb_cgroup.c: In function 'hugetlb_cgroup_migrate':
mm/hugetlb_cgroup.c:777:25: warning: variable 'h_cg' set but not used
[-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  struct hugetlb_cgroup *h_cg;
                         ^~~~

Solution is to add the missing steps, namly setting the reservation
hugetlb_cgroup to NULL on the old page, and setting the fault
hugetlb_cgroup on the new page.
