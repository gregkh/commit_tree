ext4: fix return-value types in several function comments

The documentation comments for ext4_read_block_bitmap_nowait and
ext4_read_inode_bitmap describe them as returning NULL on error, but
they return an ERR_PTR on error; update the documentation to match.

The documentation comment for ext4_wait_block_bitmap describes it as
returning 1 on error, but it returns -errno on error; update the
documentation to match.
