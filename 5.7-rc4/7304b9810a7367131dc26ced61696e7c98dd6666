drm/edid: Check the number of detailed timing descriptors in the CEA ext block

CEA-861 says :
"d = offset for the byte following the reserved data block.
 If no data is provided in the reserved data block, then d=4.
 If no DTDs are provided, then d=0."

So let's not look for DTDs when d==0. In fact let's just make that
<4 since those values would just mean that he DTDs overlap the block
header. And let's also check that d isn't so big as to declare
the descriptors to live past the block end, although the code
does already survive that case as we'd just end up with a negative
number of descriptors and the loop would not do anything.
