libfs: fix infoleak in simple_attr_read()

Reading from a debugfs file at a nonzero position, without first reading
at position 0, leaks uninitialized memory to userspace.

It's a bit tricky to do this, since lseek() and pread() aren't allowed
on these files, and write() doesn't update the position on them.  But
writing to them with splice() *does* update the position:

	#define _GNU_SOURCE 1
	#include <fcntl.h>
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	int main()
	{
		int pipes[2], fd, n, i;
		char buf[32];

		pipe(pipes);
		write(pipes[1], "0", 1);
		fd = open("/sys/kernel/debug/fault_around_bytes", O_RDWR);
		splice(pipes[0], NULL, fd, NULL, 1, 0);
		n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
		for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
			printf("%02x", buf[i]);
		printf("\n");
	}

Output:
	5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a30

Fix the infoleak by making simple_attr_read() always fill
simple_attr::get_buf if it hasn't been filled yet.
