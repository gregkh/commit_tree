ARM: 8962/1: kexec: drop invalid assembly argument

The tst menomic has only a single #<const> argument in Thumb mode. There
is an ARM variant which allows to write #<const> as #<byte>, #<rot>
which probably is where the current syntax comes from.

It seems that binutils does not care about the additional parameter.
Clang however complains in Thumb2 mode:
arch/arm/kernel/relocate_kernel.S:28:12: error: too many operands for
instruction
 tst r3,#1,0
           ^

Drop the unnecessary parameter. This fixes building this file in Thumb2
mode with the Clang integrated assembler.
