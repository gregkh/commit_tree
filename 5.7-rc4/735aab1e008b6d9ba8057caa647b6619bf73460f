kbuild: add -Wall to KBUILD_HOSTCXXFLAGS

Add -Wall to catch more warnings for C++ host programs.

When I submitted the previous version, the 0-day bot reported
-Wc++11-compat warnings for old GCC:

  HOSTCXX -fPIC scripts/gcc-plugins/latent_entropy_plugin.o

                        ^

The source of the warnings is in the plugin headers, so we have no
control of it. I just suppressed them by adding -Wno-c++11-compat to
scripts/gcc-plugins/Makefile.
