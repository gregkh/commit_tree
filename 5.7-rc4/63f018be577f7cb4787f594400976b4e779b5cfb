btrfs: Remove __ prefix from btrfs_block_rsv_release

Currently the non-prefixed version is a simple wrapper used to hide
the 4th argument of the prefixed version. This doesn't bring much value
in practice and only makes the code harder to follow by adding another
level of indirection. Rectify this by removing the __ prefix and
have only one public function to release bytes from a block reservation.
No semantic changes.
