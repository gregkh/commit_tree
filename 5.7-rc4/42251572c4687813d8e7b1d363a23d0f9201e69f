x86: remove always-defined CONFIG_AS_AVX

CONFIG_AS_AVX was introduced by commit ea4d26ae24e5 ("raid5: add AVX
optimized RAID5 checksumming").

We raise the minimal supported binutils version from time to time.
The last bump was commit 1fb12b35e5ff ("kbuild: Raise the minimum
required binutils version to 2.21").

I confirmed the code in $(call as-instr,...) can be assembled by the
binutils 2.21 assembler and also by LLVM integrated assembler.

Remove CONFIG_AS_AVX, which is always defined.
