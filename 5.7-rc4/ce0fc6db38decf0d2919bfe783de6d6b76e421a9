crypto: ccree - protect against empty or NULL scatterlists

Deal gracefully with a NULL or empty scatterlist which can happen
if both cryptlen and assoclen are zero and we're doing in-place
AEAD encryption.

This fixes a crash when this causes us to try and map a NULL page,
at least with some platforms / DMA mapping configs.
