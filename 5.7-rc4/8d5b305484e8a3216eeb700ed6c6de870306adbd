serial: 8250: Optimize irq enable after console write

Commit 7f9803072ff6 ("serial: 8250: Support console on software emulated
rs485 ports") amended serial8250_console_write() with rs485 support, but
positioned the invocation of ->rs485_stop_tx() after re-enablement of
interrupts.  The irq handler and ->console_write() are serialized with
the port spinlock, so no problem there, but due to the rs485 delay, the
irq handler may unnecessarily spin for a while.  Avoid that by moving
->rs485_stop_tx() before re-enablement of interrupts, which also mirrors
the order at the beginning of serial8250_console_write().
