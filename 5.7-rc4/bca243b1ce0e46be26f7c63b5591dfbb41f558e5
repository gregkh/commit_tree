media: flexcop-usb: fix endpoint sanity check

commit 1b976fc6d684 ("media: b2c2-flexcop-usb: add sanity checking") added
an endpoint sanity check to address a NULL-pointer dereference on probe.
Unfortunately the check was done on the current altsetting which was later
changed.

Fix this by moving the sanity check to after the altsetting is changed.
