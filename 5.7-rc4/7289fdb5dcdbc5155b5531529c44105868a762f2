KVM: Remove CREATE_IRQCHIP/SET_PIT2 race

Fixes a NULL pointer dereference, caused by the PIT firing an interrupt
before the interrupt table has been initialized.

SET_PIT2 can race with the creation of the IRQchip. In particular,
if SET_PIT2 is called with a low PIT timer period (after the creation of
the IOAPIC, but before the instantiation of the irq routes), the PIT can
fire an interrupt at an uninitialized table.
