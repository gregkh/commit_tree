net/smc: improve smc_lgr_cleanup()

smc_lgr_cleanup() is called during termination processing, there is no
need to send a DELETE_LINK at that time. A DELETE_LINK should have been
sent before the termination is initiated, if needed.
And remove the extra call to wake_up(&lnk->wr_reg_wait) because
smc_llc_link_inactive() already calls the related helper function
smc_wr_wakeup_reg_wait().
