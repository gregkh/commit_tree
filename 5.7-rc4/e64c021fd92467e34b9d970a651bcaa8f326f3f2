bus: ti-sysc: Rename clk related quirks to pre_reset and post_reset quirks

The clk_disable_quirk and clk_enable_quirk should really be called
pre_reset_quirk and post_reset_quirk to avoid confusion like we had
with hdq1w reset.

Let's also rename the related functions so the code is easier to follow.
Note that we also have reset_done_quirk that is needed in some cases
after checking the separate register for reset done bit.
