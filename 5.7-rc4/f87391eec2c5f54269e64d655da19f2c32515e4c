mmc: sdhci: iproc: Add custom set_power() callback for bcm2711

The controller needs a valid bus voltage in its power register
regardless of whether an external regulator is taking care of the power
supply.

The sdhci core already provides a helper function for this,
sdhci_set_power_and_bus_voltage(), so create a bcm2711 specific 'struct
sdhci_ops' which makes use of it.
