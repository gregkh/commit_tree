tracing: Create set_event_notrace_pid to not trace tasks

There's currently a way to select a task that should only have its events
traced, but there's no way to select a task not to have itsevents traced.
Add a set_event_notrace_pid file that acts the same as set_event_pid (and is
also affected by event-fork), but the task pids in this file will not be
traced even if they are listed in the set_event_pid file. This makes it easy
for tools like trace-cmd to "hide" itself from beint traced by events when
it is recording other tasks.
