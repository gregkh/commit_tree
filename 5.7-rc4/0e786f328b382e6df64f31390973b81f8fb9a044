Fix the following sparse warning:

drivers/hwmon/k10temp.c:189:12: warning: symbol 'k10temp_temp_label' was
not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/hwmon/k10temp.c:202:12: warning: symbol 'k10temp_in_label' was
not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/hwmon/k10temp.c:207:12: warning: symbol 'k10temp_curr_label' was
not declared. Should it be static?
