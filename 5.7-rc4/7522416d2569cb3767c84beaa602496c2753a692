tun: get rid of DBG1() macro

This macro is no-op unless TUN_DEBUG is defined (which requires editing and
recompiling the source) and only does something if variable debug is 2 but
that variable is zero initialized and never set to anything else. Moreover,
the only use of the macro informs about entering function tun_chr_open()
which can be easily achieved using ftrace or kprobe.

Drop DBG1() macro, its only use and global variable debug.
