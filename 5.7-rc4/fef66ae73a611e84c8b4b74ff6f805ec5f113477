ALSA: usb-audio: Add connector notifier delegation

It turned out that ALC1220-VB USB-audio device gives the interrupt
event to some PCM terminals while those don't allow the connector
state request but only the actual I/O terminals return the request.
The recent commit 7dc3c5a0172e ("ALSA: usb-audio: Don't create jack
controls for PCM terminals") excluded those phantom terminals, so
those events are ignored, too.

My first thought was that this could be easily deduced from the
associated terminals, but some of them have even no associate terminal
ID, hence it's not too trivial to figure out.

Since the number of such terminals are small and limited, this patch
implements another quirk table for the simple mapping of the
connectors.  It's not really scalable, but let's hope that there will
be not many such funky devices in future.
