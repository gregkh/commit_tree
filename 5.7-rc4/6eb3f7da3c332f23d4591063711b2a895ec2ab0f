drm/amd/display: fix rn soc bb update

Currently RN SOC bounding box update assumes we will get at least
2 clock states from SMU. This isn't always true and because of special
casing on first clock state we end up with low disp, dpp, dsc and phy
clocks.

This change removes the special casing allowing the first state to
acquire correct clocks.
