KVM: arm64: GICv4.1: Reload VLPI configuration on distributor enable/disable

Each time a Group-enable bit gets flipped, the state of these bits
needs to be forwarded to the hardware. This is a pretty heavy
handed operation, requiring all vcpus to reload their GICv4
configuration. It is thus implemented as a new request type.

These enable bits are programmed into the HW by setting the VGrp{0,1}En
fields of GICR_VPENDBASER when the vPEs are made resident again.

Of course, we only support Group-1 for now...
