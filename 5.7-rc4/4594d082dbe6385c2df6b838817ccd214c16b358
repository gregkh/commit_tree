rtc: zynqmp: Clear alarm interrupt status before interrupt enable

Fix multiple occurring interrupts for alarm interrupt. RTC module doesn't
clear the alarm interrupt status bit immediately after the interrupt is
triggered.This is due to the sticky nature of the alarm interrupt status
register. The alarm interrupt status register can be cleared only after
the second counter outruns the set alarm value. To fix multiple spurious
interrupts, disable alarm interrupt in the handler and clear the status
bit before enabling the alarm interrupt.
