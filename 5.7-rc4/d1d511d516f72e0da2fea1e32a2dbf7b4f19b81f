drm: tiny: st7735r: Add support for Okaya RH128128T

Add support for the Okaya RH128128T display to the st7735r driver on
DT-enabled systems.

The RH128128T is a 128x128 1.44" TFT display driven by a Sitronix
ST7715R TFT Controller/Driver.  The latter is very similar to the
ST7735R, and can be handled by the existing st7735r driver.
