soundwire: stream: only prepare stream when it is configured.

We don't need to prepare the stream again if the stream is already
prepared.

sdw_prepare_stream() could be called multiple times without calling
sdw_deprepare_stream(). We call sdw_prepare_stream() in the prepare
dai ops and sdw_deprepare_stream() in the hw_free dai ops. If an xrun
happens, sdw_prepare_stream() will be called but
sdw_deprepare_stream() will not, which results in an imbalance and an
invalid total bandwidth.
