docs: pretty up sysctl/kernel.rst

This updates sysctl/kernel.rst to use ReStructured Text more fully:
* the list of files is now the table of contents (old entries with no
  corresponding sections are added as empty sections for now);
* code references and commands are formatted as code, except for
  function names which end up linked to the appropriate documentation;
* links are used to point to other documentation and other sections;
* tables are used to make lists of values more readable (as already
  done for some sections);
* in heavily-reworked paragraphs, sentences are wrapped individually,
  to make future diffs easier to read.

The first mention of the kernel version is dropped. The second
mention, saying that the document is accurate for 2.2, is preserved
for now; I will update that once the document really is accurate for a
current kernel release.
