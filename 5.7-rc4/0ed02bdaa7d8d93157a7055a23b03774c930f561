efi/libstub: Move efi_random_alloc() into separate source file

efi_random_alloc() is only used on arm64, but as it shares a source
file with efi_random_get_seed(), the latter will pull in the former
on other architectures as well.

Let's take advantage of the fact that libstub is a static library,
and so the linker will only incorporate objects that are needed to
satisfy dependencies in other objects. This means we can move the
random alloc code to a separate source file that gets built
unconditionally, but only used when needed.
