psi: Move PF_MEMSTALL out of task->flags

The task->flags is a 32-bits flag, in which 31 bits have already been
consumed. So it is hardly to introduce other new per process flag.
Currently there're still enough spaces in the bit-field section of
task_struct, so we can define the memstall state as a single bit in
task_struct instead.
This patch also removes an out-of-date comment pointed by Matthew.
