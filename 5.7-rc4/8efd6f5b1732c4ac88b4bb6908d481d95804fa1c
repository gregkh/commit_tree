mm/memory.c: refactor insert_page to prepare for batched-lock insert

Add helper methods for vm_insert_page()/insert_page() to prepare for
vm_insert_pages(), which batch-inserts pages to reduce spinlock
operations when inserting multiple consecutive pages into the user page
table.

The intention of this patch-set is to reduce atomic ops for tcp zerocopy
receives, which normally hits the same spinlock multiple times
consecutively.
