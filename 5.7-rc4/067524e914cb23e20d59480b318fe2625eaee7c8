io_uring: provide means of removing buffers

We have IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS, but the only way to remove buffers
is to trigger IO on them. The usual case of shrinking a buffer pool
would be to just not replenish the buffers when IO completes, and
instead just free it. But it may be nice to have a way to manually
remove a number of buffers from a given group, and
IORING_OP_REMOVE_BUFFERS provides that functionality.
