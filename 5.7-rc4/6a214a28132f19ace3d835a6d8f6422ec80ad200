irqchip/versatile-fpga: Apply clear-mask earlier

Clear its own IRQs before the parent IRQ get enabled, so that the
remaining IRQs do not accidentally interrupt the parent IRQ controller.

This patch also fixes a reboot bug on OX820 SoC, where the remaining
rps-timer IRQ raises a GIC interrupt that is left pending. After that,
the rps-timer IRQ is cleared during driver initialization, and there's
no IRQ left in rps-irq when local_irq_enable() is called, which evokes
an error message "unexpected IRQ trap".
