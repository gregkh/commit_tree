parisc: remove nargs from __SYSCALL

The __SYSCALL macro's arguments are system call number,
system call entry name and number of arguments for the
system call.

Argument- nargs in __SYSCALL(nr, entry, nargs) is neither
calculated nor used anywhere. So it would be better to
keep the implementaion as  __SYSCALL(nr, entry). This will
unifies the implementation with some other architetures
too.
