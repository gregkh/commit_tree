media: lmedm04: remove redundant assignment to variable gate

The variable gate is being initialized and also checked and re-assigned
with values that are never read as it is being re-assigned later in a
for-loop with a new value.  The assignments are redundant and can be
removed.

Addresses Coverity ("Unused value")
