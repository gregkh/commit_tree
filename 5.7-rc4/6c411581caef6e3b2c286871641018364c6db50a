staging: wilc1000: avoid double unlocking of 'wilc->hif_cs' mutex

Possible double unlocking of 'wilc->hif_cs' mutex was identified by
smatch [1]. Removed the extra call to release_bus() in
wilc_wlan_handle_txq() which was missed in earlier commit fdc2ac1aafc6
("staging: wilc1000: support suspend/resume functionality").
