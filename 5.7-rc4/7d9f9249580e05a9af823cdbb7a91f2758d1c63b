gfs2: Add verbose option to check_journal_clean

Before this patch, function check_journal_clean would give messages
related to journal recovery. That's fine for mount time, but when a
node withdraws and forces replay that way, we don't want all those
distracting and misleading messages. This patch adds a new parameter
to make those messages optional.
