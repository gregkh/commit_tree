crypto: caam - update xts sector size for large input length

Since in the software implementation of XTS-AES there is
no notion of sector every input length is processed the same way.
CAAM implementation has the notion of sector which causes different
results between the software implementation and the one in CAAM
for input lengths bigger than 512 bytes.
Increase sector size to maximum value on 16 bits.
