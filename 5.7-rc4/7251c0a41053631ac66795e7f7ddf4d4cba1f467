scsi: c6x: Include <linux/unaligned/generic.h> instead of duplicating it

Use the generic __{get,put}_unaligned_[bl]e() definitions instead of
duplicating these. Since a later patch will add more definitions into
<linux/unaligned/generic.h>, this patch ensures that these definitions have
to be added only once. See also commit a7f626c1948a ("C6X: headers").  See
also commit 6510d41954dc ("kernel: Move arches to use common unaligned
access").
