mtd: spinand: Explicitly use MTD_OPS_RAW to write the bad block marker to OOB

When writing the bad block marker to the OOB area the access mode
should be set to MTD_OPS_RAW as it is done for reading the marker.
Currently this only works because req.mode is initialized to
MTD_OPS_PLACE_OOB (0) and spinand_write_to_cache_op() checks for
req.mode != MTD_OPS_AUTO_OOB.

Fix this by explicitly setting req.mode to MTD_OPS_RAW.
