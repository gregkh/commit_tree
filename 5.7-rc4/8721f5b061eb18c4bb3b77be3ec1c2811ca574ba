KVM: x86: Add a helper to check kernel support when setting cpu cap

Add a helper, kvm_cpu_cap_check_and_set(), to query boot_cpu_has() as
part of setting a KVM cpu capability.  VMX in particular has a number of
features that are dependent on both a VMCS capability and kernel
support.

No functional change intended.
