scsi: lpfc: Fix coverity errors in fmdi attribute handling

Coverity reported a memory corruption error for the fdmi attributes
routines:

  CID 15768 [Memory Corruption] Out-of-bounds access on FDMI

Sloppy coding of the fmdi structures. In both the lpfc_fdmi_attr_def and
lpfc_fdmi_reg_port_list structures, a field was placed at the start of
payload that may have variable content. The field was given an arbitrary
type (uint32_t). The code then uses the field name to derive an address,
which it used in things such as memset and memcpy. The memset sizes or
memcpy lengths were larger than the arbitrary type, thus coverity reported
an error.

Fix by replacing the arbitrary fields with the real field structures
describing the payload.
