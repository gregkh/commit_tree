KVM: x86: Use common loop iterator when handling CPUID 0xD.N

Use __do_cpuid_func()'s common loop iterator, "i", when enumerating the
sub-leafs for CPUID 0xD now that the CPUID 0xD loop doesn't need to
manual maintain separate counts for the entries index and CPUID index.

No functional changed intended.
