KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix H_CEDE return code for nested guests

The h_cede_tm kvm-unit-test currently fails when run inside an L1 guest
via the guest/nested hypervisor.

  ./run-tests.sh -v
  ...
  TESTNAME=h_cede_tm TIMEOUT=90s ACCEL= ./powerpc/run powerpc/tm.elf -smp 2,threads=2 -machine cap-htm=on -append "h_cede_tm"
  FAIL h_cede_tm (2 tests, 1 unexpected failures)

While the test relates to transactional memory instructions, the actual
failure is due to the return code of the H_CEDE hypercall, which is
reported as 224 instead of 0. This happens even when no TM instructions
are issued.

224 is the value placed in r3 to execute a hypercall for H_CEDE, and r3
is where the caller expects the return code to be placed upon return.

In the case of guest running under a nested hypervisor, issuing H_CEDE
causes a return from H_ENTER_NESTED. In this case H_CEDE is
specially-handled immediately rather than later in
kvmppc_pseries_do_hcall() as with most other hcalls, but we forget to
set the return code for the caller, hence why kvm-unit-test sees the
224 return code and reports an error.

Guest kernels generally don't check the return value of H_CEDE, so
that likely explains why this hasn't caused issues outside of
kvm-unit-tests so far.

Fix this by setting r3 to 0 after we finish processing the H_CEDE.
