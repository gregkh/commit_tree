drivers/base/power: add dpm_sysfs_change_owner()

Add a helper to change the owner of a device's power entries. This
needs to happen when the ownership of a device is changed, e.g. when
moving network devices between network namespaces.
This function will be used to correctly account for ownership changes,
e.g. when moving network devices between network namespaces.
