platform/x86: GPD pocket fan: Fix error message when temp-limits are out of range

Commit 1f27dbd8265d ("platform/x86: GPD pocket fan: Allow somewhat
lower/higher temperature limits") changed the module-param sanity check
to accept temperature limits between 20 and 90 degrees celcius.

But the error message printed when the module params are outside this
range was not updated. This commit updates the error message to match
the new min and max value for the temp-limits.
