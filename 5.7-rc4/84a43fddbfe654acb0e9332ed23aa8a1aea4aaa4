ARM: OMAP4: hwmod_data: Remove OMAP4 IPU hwmod data

The OMAP4 IPU hwmod is currently not used in DT, and the new DTS
node shall be added as per the new OMAP remoteproc bindings with
the underneath MMU device relying on the ti-sysc infrastructure.
Drop the legacy hwmod data for OMAP4 IPU as this will not be used
going forward.
