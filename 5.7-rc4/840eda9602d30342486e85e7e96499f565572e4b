scsi: lpfc: Fix erroneous cpu limit of 128 on I/O statistics

The cpu io statistics were capped by a hard define limit of 128. This
effectively was a max number of CPUs, not an actual CPU count, nor actual
CPU numbers which can be even larger than both of those values. This made
stats off/misleading and on large CPU count systems, wrong.

Fix the stats so that all CPUs can have a stats struct.  Fix the looping
such that it loops by hdwq, finds CPUs that used the hdwq, and sum the
stats, then display.
