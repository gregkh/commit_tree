handle_dots(), follow_dotdot{,_rcu}(): preparation to switch to step_into()

Right now the tail ends of follow_dotdot{,_rcu}() are pretty
much the open-coded analogues of step_into().  The differences:
	* the lack of proper LOOKUP_NO_XDEV handling in non-RCU case
(arguably a bug)
	* the lack of ->d_manage() handling (again, arguably a bug)

Adjust the calling conventions so that on the next step with could
just switch those functions to returning step_into().
