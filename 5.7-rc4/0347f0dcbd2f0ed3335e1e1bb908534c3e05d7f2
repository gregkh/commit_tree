phy: qcom-qmp: Add MSM8996 UFS QMP support

The support for the 14nm MSM8996 UFS PHY is currently handled by the
UFS-specific 14nm QMP driver, due to the earlier need for additional
operations beyond the standard PHY API.

Add support for this PHY to the common QMP driver, to allow us to remove
the old driver.
