net: meth: remove spurious copyright text

Evidently, at some point in the pre-githistorious past,
drivers/net/ethernet/sgi/meth.h somehow contained some code from the
"snull" driver from the Linux Device Drivers book.  A comment crediting
that source, asserting copyright ownership by the LDD authors, and imposing
the LDD2 license terms was duly added to the file.

Any code that may have been derived from snull is long gone, and the
distribution terms are not GPL-compatible.  Since the copyright claim is
not based in fact (if it ever was), simply remove it and the distribution
terms as well.
