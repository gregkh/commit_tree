scsi: lpfc: Fix update of wq consumer index in lpfc_sli4_wq_release

The lpfc_sli4_wq_release() routine iterates for each interim value when
updating the wq consuemr index.  This wastes cycles and possibly confuses
things as thevalue itterates (and the modulo logic is being applied).

There's no reason for this. Just set it to the value from the hw.
