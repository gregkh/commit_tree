drm/i915/gt: Protect execlists_hold/unhold from new waiters

As we may add new waiters to a request as it is being run, we need to
mark the list iteration as being safe for concurrent addition.

v2: Mika spotted that we used the same trick for signalers_list, so warn
the compiler about the lockless walk there as well.
