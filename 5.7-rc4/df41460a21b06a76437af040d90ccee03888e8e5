ext4: fix incorrect group count in ext4_fill_super error message

ext4_fill_super doublechecks the number of groups before mounting; if
that check fails, the resulting error message prints the group count
from the ext4_sb_info sbi, which hasn't been set yet. Print the freshly
computed group count instead (which at that point has just been computed
in "blocks_count").
