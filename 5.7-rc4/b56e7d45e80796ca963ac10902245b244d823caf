x86, sched: Don't enable static key when starting secondary CPUs

The static key arch_scale_freq_key only needs to be enabled once (at
boot). This change fixes a bug by which the key was enabled every time cpu0
is started, even as a secondary CPU during cpu hotplug. Secondary CPUs are
started from the idle thread: setting a static key from there means
acquiring a lock and may result in sleeping in the idle task, causing CPU
lockup.

Another consequence of this change is that init_counter_refs() is now
called on each CPU correctly; previously the function on_each_cpu() was
used, but it was called at boot when the only online cpu is cpu0.
