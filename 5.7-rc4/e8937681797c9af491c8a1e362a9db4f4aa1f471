devlink: prepare to support region operations

Modify the devlink region code in preparation for adding new operations
on regions.

Create a devlink_region_ops structure, and move the name pointer from
within the devlink_region structure into the ops structure (similar to
the devlink_health_reporter_ops).

This prepares the regions to enable support of additional operations in
the future such as requesting snapshots, or accessing the region
directly without a snapshot.

In order to re-use the constant strings in the mlx4 driver their
declaration must be changed to 'const char * const' to ensure the
compiler realizes that both the data and the pointer cannot change.
