fold handle_mounts() into step_into()

The following is true:
	* calls of handle_mounts() and step_into() are always
paired in sequences like
	err = handle_mounts(nd, dentry, &path, &inode, &seq);
	if (unlikely(err < 0))
		return err;
	err = step_into(nd, &path, flags, inode, seq);
	* in all such sequences path is uninitialized before and
unused after this pair of calls
	* in all such sequences inode and seq are unused afterwards.

So the call of handle_mounts() can be shifted inside step_into(),
turning 'path' into a local variable in the combined function.
