powerpc/boot: Delete unneeded .globl _zimage_start

.globl sets the symbol binding to STB_GLOBAL while .weak sets the
binding to STB_WEAK. GNU as let .weak override .globl since
binutils-gdb 5ca547dc2399a0a5d9f20626d4bf5547c3ccfddd (1996). Clang
integrated assembler let the last win but it may error in the future.

Since it is a convention that only one binding directive is used, just
delete .globl.
