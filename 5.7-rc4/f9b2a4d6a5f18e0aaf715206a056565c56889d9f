rtc: class: support hctosys from modular RTC drivers

Due to distribution constraints it may not be possible to statically
compile the required RTC driver into the kernel.

Expand RTC_HCTOSYS support to cover all RTC devices (statically compiled
or not) by checking at the end of RTC device registration whether the
time should be synced.
