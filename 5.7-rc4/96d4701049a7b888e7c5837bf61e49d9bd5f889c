KVM: nVMX: Drop unnecessary check on ept caps for execute-only

Drop the call to cpu_has_vmx_ept_execute_only() when calculating which
EPT capabilities will be exposed to L1 for nested EPT.  The resulting
configuration is immediately sanitized by the passed in @ept_caps, and
except for the call from vmx_check_processor_compat(), @ept_caps is the
capabilities that are queried by cpu_has_vmx_ept_execute_only().  For
vmx_check_processor_compat(), KVM *wants* to ignore vmx_capability.ept
so that a divergence in EPT capabilities between CPUs is detected.
