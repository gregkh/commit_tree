pinctrl: sunxi: Forward calls to irq_set_irq_wake

The pinctrl irqchip may be connected to an irqchip that implements the
.irq_set_wake callback, such as the R_INTC on A31 and newer sunxi SoCs.
In order for GPIOs to be able to trigger wakeup, the IRQ from the
pinctrl to the upper irqchip must also be enabled for wakeup. Since the
kernel's IRQ core already manages the "wake_depth" of each IRQ, no
additional accounting is needed in the pinctrl driver.
