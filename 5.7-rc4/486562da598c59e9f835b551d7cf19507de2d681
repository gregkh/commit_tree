irqchip/versatile-fpga: Handle chained IRQs properly

Enclose the chained handler with chained_irq_{enter,exit}(), so that the
muxed interrupts get properly acked.

This patch also fixes a reboot bug on OX820 SoC, where the jiffies timer
interrupt is never acked. The kernel waits a clock tick forever in
calibrate_delay_converge(), which leads to a boot hang.
