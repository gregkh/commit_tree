ASoC: rsnd: Fix HDMI channel mapping for multi-SSI mode

The HDMI?_SEL register maps up to four stereo SSI data lanes onto the
sdata[0..3] inputs of the HDMI output block. The upper half of the
register contains four blocks of 4 bits, with the most significant
controlling the sdata3 line and the least significant the sdata0 line.

The shift calculation has an off-by-one error, causing the parent SSI to
be mapped to sdata3, the first multi-SSI child to sdata0 and so forth.
As the parent SSI transmits the stereo L/R channels, and the HDMI core
expects it on the sdata0 line, this causes no audio to be output when
playing stereo audio on a multichannel capable HDMI out, and
multichannel audio has permutated channels.

Fix the shift calculation to map the parent SSI to sdata0, the first
child to sdata1 etc.
