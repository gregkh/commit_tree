KVM: x86: Use supported_xcr0 to detect MPX support

Query supported_xcr0 when checking for MPX support instead of invoking
->mpx_supported() and drop ->mpx_supported() as kvm_mpx_supported() was
its last user.  Rename vmx_mpx_supported() to cpu_has_vmx_mpx() to
better align with VMX/VMCS nomenclature.

Modify VMX's adjustment of xcr0 to call cpus_has_vmx_mpx() (renamed from
vmx_mpx_supported()) directly to avoid reading supported_xcr0 before
it's fully configured.

No functional change intended.
