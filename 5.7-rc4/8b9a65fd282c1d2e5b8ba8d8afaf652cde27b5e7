mm: return faster for non-fatal signals in user mode faults

The idea comes from the upstream discussion between Linus and Andrea:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20171102193644.GB22686@redhat.com/

A summary to the issue: there was a special path in handle_userfault() in
the past that we'll return a VM_FAULT_NOPAGE when we detected non-fatal
signals when waiting for userfault handling.  We did that by reacquiring
the mmap_sem before returning.  However that brings a risk in that the
vmas might have changed when we retake the mmap_sem and even we could be
holding an invalid vma structure.

This patch is a preparation of removing that special path by allowing the
page fault to return even faster if we were interrupted by a non-fatal
signal during a user-mode page fault handling routine.
