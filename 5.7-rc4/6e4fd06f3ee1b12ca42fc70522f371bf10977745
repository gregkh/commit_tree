KVM: x86: Drop __exit from kvm_x86_ops' hardware_unsetup()

Remove the __exit annotation from VMX hardware_unsetup(), the hook
can be reached during kvm_init() by way of kvm_arch_hardware_unsetup()
if failure occurs at various points during initialization.

Removing the annotation also lets us annotate vmx_x86_ops and svm_x86_ops
with __initdata; otherwise, objtool complains because it doesn't
understand that the vendor specific __initdata is being copied by value
to a non-__initdata instance.
