bpf, lsm: Make BPF_LSM depend on BPF_EVENTS

LSM and tracing programs share their helpers with bpf_tracing_func_proto
which is only defined (in bpf_trace.c) when BPF_EVENTS is enabled.

Instead of adding __weak symbol, make BPF_LSM depend on BPF_EVENTS so
that both tracing and LSM programs can actually share helpers.
