x86/boot: Remove KEEP_SEGMENTS support

Commit a24e785111a3 ("i386: paravirt boot sequence") added this flag for
use by paravirtualized environments such as Xen. However, Xen never made
use of this flag [1], and it was only ever used by lguest [2].

Commit ecda85e70277 ("x86/lguest: Remove lguest support") removed
lguest, so KEEP_SEGMENTS has lost its last user.
