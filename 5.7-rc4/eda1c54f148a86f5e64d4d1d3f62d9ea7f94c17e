cifs: Allocate crypto structures on the fly for calculating signatures of incoming packets

CIFS uses pre-allocated crypto structures to calculate signatures for both
incoming and outgoing packets. In this way it doesn't need to allocate crypto
structures for every packet, but it requires a lock to prevent concurrent
access to crypto structures.

Remove the lock by allocating crypto structures on the fly for
incoming packets. At the same time, we can still use pre-allocated crypto
structures for outgoing packets, as they are already protected by transport
lock srv_mutex.
