ALSA: hda/hdmi: Move runtime PM resume into hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs()

For improving the readability, move the runtime PM handling code from
hdmi_present_sense() to hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs().  Now
hdmi_present_sense() became symmetric for both audio-component and
legacy cases.

Just a minor code refactoring.
