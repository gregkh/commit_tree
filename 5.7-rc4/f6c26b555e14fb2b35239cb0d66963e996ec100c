drm/i915: Never allow userptr into the new mapping types

Commit 4f2a572eda67 ("drm/i915/userptr: Never allow userptr into the
mappable GGTT") made I915_GEM_MMAP_GTT IOCTLs to fail when attempted
on a userptr object in order to protect from a lockdep splat.  Later
on, new mapping types were introduced by commit cc662126b413
("drm/i915: Introduce DRM_I915_GEM_MMAP_OFFSET").  Those new mapping
types suffer from the same lockdep splat issue but they now succeed
when tried on top of a userptr object.  Fix it.
