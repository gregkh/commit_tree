mmc: sdhci-msm: Don't enable PWRSAVE_DLL for certain sdhc hosts

SDHC core with new 14lpp and later tech DLL should not enable
PWRSAVE_DLL since such controller's internal gating cannot meet
following MCLK requirement:
When MCLK is gated OFF, it is not gated for less than 0.5us and MCLK
must be switched on for at-least 1us before DATA starts coming.

Adding support for this requirement.
