soundwire: stream: update state machine and add state checks

The state machine and notes don't accurately explain or allow
transitions from STREAM_DEPREPARED and STREAM_DISABLED.

Add more explanations and allow for more transitions as a result of a
trigger_stop(), trigger_suspend() and prepare(), depending on the
ALSA/ASoC layer behavior defined by the INFO_RESUME and INFO_PAUSE
flags.

Also add basic checks to help debug inconsistent states and illegal
state machine transitions.
