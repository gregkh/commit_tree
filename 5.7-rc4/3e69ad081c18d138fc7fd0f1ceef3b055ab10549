mm/userfaultfd: honor FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE in fault path

Userfaultfd fault path was by default killable even if the caller does not
have FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE.  That makes sense before in that when with gup
we don't have FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE properly set before.  Now after previous
patch we've got FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE applied even for gup code so it should
also make sense to let userfaultfd to honor the FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE.

Because we're unconditionally setting FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE in gup code
right now, this patch should have no functional change.  It also cleaned
the code a little bit by introducing some helpers.
