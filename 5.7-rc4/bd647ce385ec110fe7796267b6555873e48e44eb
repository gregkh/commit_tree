btrfs: add a leak check for roots

Now that we're going to start relying on getting ref counting right for
roots, add a list to track allocated roots and print out any roots that
aren't freed up at free_fs_info time.

Hide this behind CONFIG_BTRFS_DEBUG because this will just be used for
developers to verify they aren't breaking things.
