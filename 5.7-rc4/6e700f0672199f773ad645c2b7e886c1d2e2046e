ASoC: meson: aiu: fix irq registration

The aiu stored the irq in an unsigned integer which may have discarded an
error returned by platform_get_irq_byname(). This is incorrect and should
have been a signed integer.

Also drop the irq error traces from the probe function as this is already
done by platform_get_irq_byname().
