scsi: ufs: Do not rely on prefetched data

We were setting bActiveICCLevel attribute for UFS device only once but the
type of this attribute has changed from persistent to volatile since UFS
device specification v2.1. This attribute is set to the default value after
power cycle or hardware reset event. It isn't safe to rely on prefetched
data (only used for bActiveICCLevel attribute now). Hence this change
removes the code related to data prefetching and set this parameter on
every attempt to probe the UFS device.
