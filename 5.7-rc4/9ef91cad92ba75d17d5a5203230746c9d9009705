ASoC: SOF: fix uninitialised "work" with VirtIO

In the VirtIO case the sof_pcm_open() function isn't called on the
host during guest streaming, which then leaves "work" structures
uninitialised. However it is then used to handle position update
messages from the DSP. Move their initialisation to immediately after
allocation of the containing structure.
