intel_th: msu: Make stopping the trace optional

Some use cases prefer to keep collecting the trace data into the last
available window while the other windows are being offloaded instead of
stopping the trace. In this scenario, the window switch happens
automatically when the next window becomes available again.

Add an option to allow this and a sysfs attribute to enable it.
