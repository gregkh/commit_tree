mtd: spi-nor: Prepare core / manufacturer code split

Move all SPI NOR controller drivers to a controllers/ sub-directory
so that we only have SPI NOR related source files under
drivers/mtd/spi-nor/.

Rename spi-nor.c into core.c, we are about to split this file in multiple
source files (one per manufacturer, plus one for the SFDP parsing logic).
