hwmon: (drivetemp) Use drivetemp's true module name in Kconfig section

The addition of the support for reading the temperature of ATA drives as
per commit 5b46903d8bf3 ("hwmon: Driver for disk and solid state drives
with temperature sensors") lists in the respective Kconfig section the
name of the module to be optionally built as "satatemp".

However, building the kernel modules with "CONFIG_SENSORS_DRIVETEMP=m",
does not generate a file named "satatemp.ko".

Instead, the rest of the original commit uses the term "drivetemp" and
a file named "drivetemp.ko" ends up in the kernel's modules directory.
This file has the right ingredients:

	$ strings /path/to/drivetemp.ko | grep ^description
	description=Hard drive temperature monitor

and modprobing it produces the expected result:

	# drivetemp is not loaded
	$ sensors -u drivetemp-scsi-4-0
	Specified sensor(s) not found!
	$ sudo modprobe drivetemp
	$ sensors -u drivetemp-scsi-4-0
	drivetemp-scsi-4-0
	Adapter: SCSI adapter
	temp1:
	  temp1_input: 35.000
	  temp1_max: 60.000
	  temp1_min: 0.000
	  temp1_crit: 70.000
	  temp1_lcrit: -40.000
	  temp1_lowest: 20.000
	  temp1_highest: 36.000

Fix Kconfig by referring to the true name of the module.
