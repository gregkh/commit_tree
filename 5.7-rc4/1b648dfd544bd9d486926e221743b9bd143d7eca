s390/cpuinfo: do not skip info for CPUs without MHz feature

In the past there were no per-CPU information in /proc/cpuinfo
other than CPU frequency. Hence, for machines without CPU MHz
feature there were nothing to show. Now CPU topology and IDs
still could be shown, so do not skip this information from the
output.
