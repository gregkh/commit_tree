KVM: x86: Copy kvm_x86_ops by value to eliminate layer of indirection

Replace the kvm_x86_ops pointer in common x86 with an instance of the
struct to save one pointer dereference when invoking functions.  Copy the
struct by value to set the ops during kvm_init().

Arbitrarily use kvm_x86_ops.hardware_enable to track whether or not the
ops have been initialized, i.e. a vendor KVM module has been loaded.
