ovl: decide if revalidate needed on a per-dentry basis

Allow completely skipping ->revalidate() on a per-dentry basis, in case the
underlying layers used for a dentry do not themselves have ->revalidate().

E.g. negative overlay dentry has no underlying layers, hence revalidate is
unnecessary.  Or if lower layer is remote but overlay dentry is pure-upper,
then can skip revalidate.

The following places need to update whether the dentry needs revalidate or
not:

 - fill-super (root dentry)
 - lookup
 - create
 - fh_to_dentry
