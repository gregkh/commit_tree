 - force usage of python3 instead of using system default
 - fix bugzilla 204773 (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204773)
 - fix issue of platform info not being reset in -multi (logs fill up)

 - check for cmd info tools at start, print found/missing in green/red
 - fix kernel suspend time calculation: tool used to look for start of
    pm_suspend_console, but the order has changed. latest kernel starts
    with ksys_sync, use this instead
 - include time spent in mem/disk in the header (same as freeze/standby)
 - ignore turbostat 32-bit capability warnings
 - print to result.txt when -skiphtml is used, just say result: pass

 - update the -multi status output to be more informative
 - -maxfail sets maximum consecutive fails before a -multi run is aborted
 - in -summary, ignore dmesg/ftrace/html files that are 0 size
