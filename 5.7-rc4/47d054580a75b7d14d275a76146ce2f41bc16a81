scsi: ufs-mediatek: fix HOST_PA_TACTIVATE quirk for Samsung UFS Devices

Device quirk "UFS_DEVICE_QUIRK_HOST_PA_TACTIVATE" is enabled for all
Samsung devices by default currently.

However MediaTek UFS host requires different host PA_TACTIVATE
configuration. Hence clear this quirk first and then apply vendor-specific
value in vops callback.
