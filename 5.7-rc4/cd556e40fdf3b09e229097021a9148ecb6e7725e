devlink: expand the devlink-info documentation

We are having multiple review cycles with all vendors trying
to implement devlink-info. Let's expand the documentation with
more information about what's implemented and motivation behind
this interface in an attempt to make the implementations easier.

Describe what each info section is supposed to contain, and make
some references to other HW interfaces (PCI caps).

Document how firmware management is expected to look, to make
it clear how devlink-info and devlink-flash work in concert.

Name some future work.

v2: - improve wording
