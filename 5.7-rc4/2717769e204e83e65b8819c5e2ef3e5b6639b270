vt: don't hardcode the mem allocation upper bound

The code in vc_do_resize() bounds the memory allocation size to avoid
exceeding MAX_ORDER down the kzalloc() call chain and generating a
runtime warning triggerable from user space. However, not only is it
unwise to use a literal value here, but MAX_ORDER may also be
configurable based on CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER.
Let's use KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE instead.

Note that prior commit bb1107f7c605 ("mm, slab: make sure that
KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE will fit into MAX_ORDER") the KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE value
could not be relied upon.
