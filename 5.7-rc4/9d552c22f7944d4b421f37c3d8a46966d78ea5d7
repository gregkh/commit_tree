drm/i915/crt: Configure connector->polled and encoder->hpd_pin consistently

Let's make sure encoder->hpd_pin and connector->polled are mirror
images of each other (when we want to use polling). The other
potentially polled connectors (sdvo and tv) already get this right.

Also nuke the redundant force_hotplug_required initialization
(the thing is kzalloc()ed).
