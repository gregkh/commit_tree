mm/hmm: return error for non-vma snapshots

The pagewalker does not call most ops with NULL vma, those are all routed
to hmm_vma_walk_hole() via ops->pte_hole instead.

Thus hmm_vma_fault() is only called with a NULL vma from
hmm_vma_walk_hole(), so hoist the NULL vma check to there.

Now it is clear that snapshotting with no vma is a HMM_PFN_ERROR as
without a vma we have no path to call hmm_vma_fault().
