mm/gup: allow to react to fatal signals

The existing gup code does not react to the fatal signals in many code
paths.  For example, in one retry path of gup we're still using
down_read() rather than down_read_killable().  Also, when doing page
faults we don't pass in FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE as well, which means that
within the faulting process we'll wait in non-killable way as well.  These
were spotted by Linus during the code review of some other patches.

Let's allow the gup code to react to fatal signals to improve the
responsiveness of threads when during gup and being killed.
