cifs: handle prefix paths in reconnect

For the case where we have a DFS path like below and we're currently
connected to targetA:

    //dfsroot/link -> //targetA/share/foo, //targetB/share/bar

after failover, we should make sure to update cifs_sb->prepath so the
next operations will use the new prefix path "/bar".

Besides, in order to simplify the use of different prefix paths,
enforce CIFS_MOUNT_USE_PREFIX_PATH for DFS mounts so we don't have to
revalidate the root dentry every time we set a new prefix path.
