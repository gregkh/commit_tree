proc, time/namespace: Show clock symbolic names in /proc/pid/timens_offsets

Michael Kerrisk suggested to replace numeric clock IDs with symbolic names.

Now the content of these files looks like this:
$ cat /proc/774/timens_offsets
monotonic      864000         0
boottime      1728000         0

For setting offsets, both representations of clocks (numeric and symbolic)
can be used.

As for compatibility, it is acceptable to change things as long as
userspace doesn't care. The format of timens_offsets files is very new and
there are no userspace tools yet which rely on this format.

But three projects crun, util-linux and criu rely on the interface of
setting time offsets and this is why it's required to continue supporting
the numeric clock IDs on write.
