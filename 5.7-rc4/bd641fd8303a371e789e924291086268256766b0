PCI: sysfs: Revert "rescan" file renames

We changed these sysfs filenames:

  .../pci_bus/<domain:bus>/rescan  ->  .../pci_bus/<domain:bus>/bus_rescan
  .../<domain:bus:dev.fn>/rescan   ->  .../<domain:bus:dev.fn>/dev_rescan

and Ruslan reported [1] that this broke a userspace application.

Revert these name changes so both files are named "rescan" again.

Note that we have to use __ATTR() to assign custom C symbols, i.e.,
"struct device_attribute <symbol>".

[bhelgaas: commit log, use __ATTR() both places so we don't have to rename
the attributes]
