drm/i915/tgl: Program MBUS_ABOX{1,2}_CTL during display init

On gen11 we only needed to program MBus credits into MBUS_ABOX_CTL
during display initialization, but on gen12 we're now supposed to
program the same values into MBUS_ABOX1_CTL and MBUS_ABOX2_CTL as well.

v2:
 - Program registers with rmw to preserve contents of unrelated bits.
 - Switch to the new display uncore helpers.
