perf/core: Add PERF_SAMPLE_CGROUP feature

The PERF_SAMPLE_CGROUP bit is to save (perf_event) cgroup information in
the sample.  It will add a 64-bit id to identify current cgroup and it's
the file handle in the cgroup file system.  Userspace should use this
information with PERF_RECORD_CGROUP event to match which cgroup it
belongs.

I put it before PERF_SAMPLE_AUX for simplicity since it just needs a
64-bit word.  But if we want bigger samples, I can work on that
direction too.

Committer testing:

  $ pahole perf_sample_data | grep -w cgroup -B5 -A5
  	/* --- cacheline 4 boundary (256 bytes) was 56 bytes ago --- */
  	struct perf_regs           regs_intr;            /*   312    16 */
  	/* --- cacheline 5 boundary (320 bytes) was 8 bytes ago --- */
  	u64                        stack_user_size;      /*   328     8 */
  	u64                        phys_addr;            /*   336     8 */
  	u64                        cgroup;               /*   344     8 */

  	/* size: 384, cachelines: 6, members: 22 */
  	/* padding: 32 */
  };
