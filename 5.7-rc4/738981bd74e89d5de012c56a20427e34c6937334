scsi: target: fix unmap_zeroes_data boolean initialisation

The LIO unmap_zeroes_data device attribute is mapped to the LBPRZ flag in
the READ CAPACITY(16) and Thin Provisioning VPD INQUIRY responses.

The unmap_zeroes_data attribute is exposed via configfs, where any write
value is correctly validated via strtobool(). However, when initialised via
target_configure_unmap_from_queue() it takes the value of the device's
max_write_zeroes_sectors queue limit, which is non-boolean.

A non-boolean value can be read from configfs, but attempting to write the
same value back results in -EINVAL, causing problems for configuration
utilities such as targetcli.
