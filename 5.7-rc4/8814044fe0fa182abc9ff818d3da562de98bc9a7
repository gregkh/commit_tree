i2c: tegra: Synchronize DMA before termination

DMA transfer could be completed, but CPU (which handles DMA interrupt)
may get too busy and can't handle the interrupt in a timely manner,
despite of DMA IRQ being raised. In this case the DMA state needs to
synchronized before terminating DMA transfer in order not to miss the
DMA transfer completion.
