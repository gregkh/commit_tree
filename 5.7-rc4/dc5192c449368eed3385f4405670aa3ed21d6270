remoteproc: Introduce "panic" callback in ops

Introduce generic support for handling kernel panics in remoteproc
drivers, in order to allow operations needed for aiding in post mortem
system debugging, such as flushing caches etc.

The function can return a number of milliseconds needed by the remote to
"settle" and the core will wait the longest returned duration before
returning from the panic handler.
