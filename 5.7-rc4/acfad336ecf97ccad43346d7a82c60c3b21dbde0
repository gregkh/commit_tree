KVM: x86: Drop redundant boot cpu checks on SSBD feature bits

Drop redundant checks when "emulating" SSBD feature across vendors,
i.e. advertising the AMD variant when running on an Intel CPU and vice
versa.  Both SPEC_CTRL_SSBD and AMD_SSBD are already defined in the
leaf-specific feature masks and are *not* forcefully set by the kernel,
i.e. will already be set in the entry when supported by the host.

Functionally, this changes nothing, but the redundant check is
confusing, especially when considering future patches that will further
differentiate between "real" and "emulated" feature bits.

No functional change intended.
