ASoC: mediatek: mt8183-da7219: add speaker switch

Da7219 and max98357a share the same I2S lines.  When writing audio data
to the I2S, both codecs generate sound.

Da7219 already has a separate control "Headphone Switch".  Adds a new
control "Speakers Switch" for turning on/off max98357a.  Userspace
program can decide to turn on/off which codecs by different use cases.
