crypto: ccm - simplify error handling in crypto_rfc4309_create()

Simplify the error handling in crypto_rfc4309_create() by taking
advantage of crypto_grab_aead() now handling an ERR_PTR() name and by
taking advantage of crypto_drop_aead() now accepting (as a no-op) a
spawn that hasn't been grabbed yet.
