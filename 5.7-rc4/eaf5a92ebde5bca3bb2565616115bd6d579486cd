sched/core: Fix reset-on-fork from RT with uclamp

uclamp_fork() resets the uclamp values to their default when the
reset-on-fork flag is set. It also checks whether the task has a RT
policy, and sets its uclamp.min to 1024 accordingly. However, during
reset-on-fork, the task's policy is lowered to SCHED_NORMAL right after,
hence leading to an erroneous uclamp.min setting for the new task if it
was forked from RT.

Fix this by removing the unnecessary check on rt_task() in
uclamp_fork() as this doesn't make sense if the reset-on-fork flag is
set.
