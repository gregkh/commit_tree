ALSA: firewire: use KBUILD_MODNAME for struct driver.name instead of string

KBUILD_MODNAME is available to name kernel modules according to its object
name. This commit uses the macro instead of string for name field of
struct driver since drivers in ALSA firewire stack have the same name of
each object name.
