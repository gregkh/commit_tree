drm/prime: fix extracting of the DMA addresses from a scatterlist

Scatterlist elements contains both pages and DMA addresses, but one
should not assume 1:1 relation between them. The sg->length is the size
of the physical memory chunk described by the sg->page, while
sg_dma_len(sg) is the size of the DMA (IO virtual) chunk described by
the sg_dma_address(sg).

The proper way of extracting both: pages and DMA addresses of the whole
buffer described by a scatterlist it to iterate independently over the
sg->pages/sg->length and sg_dma_address(sg)/sg_dma_len(sg) entries.
