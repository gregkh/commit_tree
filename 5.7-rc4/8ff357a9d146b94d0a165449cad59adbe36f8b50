crypto: testmgr - do comparison tests before inauthentic input tests

Do test_aead_vs_generic_impl() before test_aead_inauthentic_inputs() so
that any differences with the generic driver are detected before getting
to the inauthentic input tests, which intentionally use only the driver
being tested (so that they run even if a generic driver is unavailable).
