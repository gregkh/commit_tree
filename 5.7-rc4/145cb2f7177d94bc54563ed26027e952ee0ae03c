sctp: Fix bundling of SHUTDOWN with COOKIE-ACK

When we start shutdown in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(), we want to bundle
the SHUTDOWN with the COOKIE-ACK to ensure that the peer receives them
at the same time and in the correct order. This bundling was broken by
commit 4ff40b86262b ("sctp: set chunk transport correctly when it's a
new asoc"), which assigns a transport for the COOKIE-ACK, but not for
the SHUTDOWN.

Fix this by passing a reference to the COOKIE-ACK chunk as an argument
to sctp_sf_do_9_2_start_shutdown() and onward to
sctp_make_shutdown(). This way the SHUTDOWN chunk is assigned the same
transport as the COOKIE-ACK chunk, which allows them to be bundled.

In sctp_sf_do_9_2_start_shutdown(), the void *arg parameter was
previously unused. Now that we're taking it into use, it must be a
valid pointer to a chunk, or NULL. There is only one call site where
it's not, in sctp_sf_autoclose_timer_expire(). Fix that too.
