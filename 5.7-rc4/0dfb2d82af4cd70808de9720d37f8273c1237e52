net: sched: rename more stats_types

Commit 53eca1f3479f ("net: rename flow_action_hw_stats_types* ->
flow_action_hw_stats*") renamed just the flow action types and
helpers. For consistency rename variables, enums, struct members
and UAPI too (note that this UAPI was not in any official release,
yet).
