cpuidle: Refactor and move out NVIDIA Tegra20 driver into drivers/cpuidle

The driver's code is refactored in a way that will make it easy to
support Tegra30/114/124 SoCs by this unified driver later on. The
current functionality is equal to the old Tegra20 driver, only the
code's structure changed a tad. This is also a proper platform driver
now.
