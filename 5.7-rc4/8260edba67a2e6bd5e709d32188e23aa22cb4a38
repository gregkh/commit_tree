btrfs: make the init of static elements in fs_info separate

In adding things like eb leak checking and root leak checking there were
a lot of weird corner cases that come from the fact that

  1) We do not init the fs_info until we get to open_ctree time in the
     normal case and

  2) The test infrastructure half-init's the fs_info for things that it
     needs.

This makes it really annoying to make changes because you have to add
init in two different places, have special cases for testing fs_info's
that may not have certain things initialized, and cases for fs_info's
that didn't make it to open_ctree and thus are not fully set up.

Fix this by extracting out the non-allocating init of the fs info into
it's own public function and use that to make sure we're all getting
consistent views of an allocated fs_info.
