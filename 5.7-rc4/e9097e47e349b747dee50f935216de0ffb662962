ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Add Recon3Di quirk to handle integrated sound on EVGA X99 Classified motherboard

I have a system which has an EVGA X99 Classified motherboard. The pin
assignments for the HD Audio controller are not correct under Linux.
Windows 10 works fine and informs me that it's using the Recon3Di
driver, and on Linux, `cat
/sys/class/sound/card0/device/subsystem_{vendor,device}` yields

0x3842
0x1038

This patch adds a corresponding entry to the quirk list.
