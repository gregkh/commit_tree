drm/i915: Drop vma is-closed assertion on insert

The is-closed flag may be added after we have acquired the vma under the
ctx->mutex, but will not take effect until after we release the
vm->mutex. i.e. the flag may be set on the vma as attempt to bind it and
that will cause the vma to be unbound later after we unpin it.
