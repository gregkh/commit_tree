powerpc/64: Implement soft interrupt replay in C

When local_irq_enable() finds a pending soft-masked interrupt, it
"replays" it by setting up registers like the initial interrupt entry,
then calls into the low level handler to set up an interrupt stack
frame and process the interrupt.

This is not necessary, and uses more stack than needed. The high level
interrupt handler can be called directly from C, with just pt_regs set
up on stack. This should be faster and use less stack.
