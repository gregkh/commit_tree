of/address: Support multiple 'dma-ranges' entries

Currently, the DMA offset and mask for a device are set based only on the
first 'dma-ranges' entry. We should really be using all the entries. The
kernel doesn't yet support multiple offsets and sizes, so the best we can
do is to find the biggest size for a single offset. The algorithm is
copied from acpi_dma_get_range().

If there's different offsets from the first entry, then we warn and
continue. It really should be an error, but this will likely break
existing DTs.
