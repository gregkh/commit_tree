ARM: dts: AM33xx-l4: Update PRUSS interconnect target-module node

The PRU-ICSS present on some AM33xx SoCs has a very unique SYSC
register. The IP also uses a hard-reset line, and requires this
PRCM reset to be deasserted to be able to access any registers.
Update the existing PRUSS interconnect target-module with all
the required properties.

The PRUSS device itself shall be added as a child node to this
interconnect node in the future. PRU-ICSS is not supported on
AM3351/AM3352/AM3354 SoCs though in the AM33xx family, so the
target module node should be disabled in derivative board files
that use any of these SoCs.
