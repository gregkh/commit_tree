ASoC: qcom: sdm845: handle soundwire stream

In existing setup WSA881x codec handles soundwire stream,
however DB845c and other machines based on SDM845c have 2
instances for WSA881x codec. This will force soundwire stream
to be prepared/enabled twice or multiple times.
Handling SoundWire Stream in machine driver would fix this issue.
