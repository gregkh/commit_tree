misc: cleanup minor number definitions in c file into miscdevice.h

HWRNG_MINOR and RNG_MISCDEV_MINOR are duplicate definitions, use
unified HWRNG_MINOR instead and moved into miscdevice.h

ANSLCD_MINOR and LCD_MINOR are duplicate definitions, use unified
LCD_MINOR instead and moved into miscdevice.h

MISCDEV_MINOR is renamed to PXA3XX_GCU_MINOR and moved into
miscdevice.h

Other definitions are just moved without any change.
