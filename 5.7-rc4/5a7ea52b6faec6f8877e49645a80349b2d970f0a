PM: QoS: Drop pm_qos_update_request_timeout()

The pm_qos_update_request_timeout() function is not called from
anywhere, so drop it along with the work member in struct
pm_qos_request needed by it.

Also drop the useless pm_qos_update_request_timeout trace event
that is only triggered by that function (so it never triggers at
all) and update the trace events documentation accordingly.
