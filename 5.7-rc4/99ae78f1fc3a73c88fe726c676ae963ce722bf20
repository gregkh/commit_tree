ARM: dts: iwg22d-sodimm: Enable touchscreen

In one of the iWave-G22D development board variants, called Generic SODIMM
Development Platform, we have an LCD with touchscreen. The resistive touch
controller, STMPE811 is on the development board and is connected through
the i2c5 of the RZ-G1E.

Additionally, this controller should generate an interrupt to the CPU and
it is connected through GPIO4,4 to the GIC.

Touch was tested with one of our iW-RainboW-G22D-SODIMM RZ/G1E development
platforms.
