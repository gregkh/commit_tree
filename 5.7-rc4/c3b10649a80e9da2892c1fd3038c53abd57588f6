perf report: Fix no branch type statistics report issue

Previously we could get the report of branch type statistics.

For example:

  # perf record -j any,save_type ...
  # t perf report --stdio

  #
  # Branch Statistics:
  #
  COND_FWD:  40.6%
  COND_BWD:   4.1%
  CROSS_4K:  24.7%
  CROSS_2M:  12.3%
      COND:  44.7%
    UNCOND:   0.0%
       IND:   6.1%
      CALL:  24.5%
       RET:  24.7%

But now for the recent perf, it can't report the branch type statistics.

It's a regression issue caused by commit 40c39e304641 ("perf report: Fix
a no annotate browser displayed issue"), which only counts the branch
type statistics for browser mode.

This patch moves the branch_type_count() outside of ui__has_annotation()
checking, then branch type statistics can work for stdio mode.
