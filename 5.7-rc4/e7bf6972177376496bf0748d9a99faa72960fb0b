arm64: entry: Additional annotation conversions for entry.S

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotation of assembly functions
in the kernel new macros have been introduced. These replace ENTRY and
ENDPROC with separate annotations for standard C callable functions,
data and code with different calling conventions.  Update the
remaining annotations in the entry.S code to the new macros.
