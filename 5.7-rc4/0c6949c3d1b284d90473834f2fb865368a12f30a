RDMA/cm: Fix missing RDMA_CM_EVENT_REJECTED event after receiving REJ message

The cm_reset_to_idle() call before formatting event changed the CM_ID
state from IB_CM_REQ_RCVD to be IB_CM_IDLE. It caused to wrong value of
CM_REJ_MESSAGE_REJECTED field.

The result of that was that rdma_reject() calls in the passive side didn't
generate RDMA_CM_EVENT_REJECTED event in the active side.
