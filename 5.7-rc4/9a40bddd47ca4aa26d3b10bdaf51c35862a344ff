drm/i915/gt: Expose heartbeat interval via sysfs

We monitor the health of the system via periodic heartbeat pulses. The
pulses also provide the opportunity to perform garbage collection.
However, we interpret an incomplete pulse (a missed heartbeat) as an
indication that the system is no longer responsive, i.e. hung, and
perform an engine or full GPU reset. Given that the preemption
granularity can be very coarse on a system, we let the sysadmin override
our legacy timeouts which were "optimised" for desktop applications.

The heartbeat interval can be adjusted per-engine using,
