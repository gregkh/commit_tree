hsr: check protocol version in hsr_newlink()

In the current hsr code, only 0 and 1 protocol versions are valid.
But current hsr code doesn't check the version, which is received by
userspace.

Test commands:
    ip link add dummy0 type dummy
    ip link add dummy1 type dummy
    ip link add hsr0 type hsr slave1 dummy0 slave2 dummy1 version 4

In the test commands, version 4 is invalid.
So, the command should be failed.

After this patch, following error will occur.
"Error: hsr: Only versions 0..1 are supported."
