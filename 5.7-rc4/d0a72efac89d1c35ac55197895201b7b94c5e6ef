cpufreq: powernv: Fix use-after-free

The cpufreq driver has a use-after-free that we can hit if:

a) There's an OCC message pending when the notifier is registered, and
b) The cpufreq driver fails to register with the core.

When a) occurs the notifier schedules a workqueue item to handle the
message. The backing work_struct is located on chips[].throttle and
when b) happens we clean up by freeing the array. Once we get to
the (now free) queued item and the kernel crashes.
