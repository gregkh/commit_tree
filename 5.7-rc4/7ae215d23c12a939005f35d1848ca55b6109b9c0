bpf: Don't refcount LISTEN sockets in sk_assign()

Avoid taking a reference on listen sockets by checking the socket type
in the sk_assign and in the corresponding skb_steal_sock() code in the
the transport layer, and by ensuring that the prefetch free (sock_pfree)
function uses the same logic to check whether the socket is refcounted.
