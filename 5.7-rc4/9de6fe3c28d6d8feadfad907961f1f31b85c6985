KVM: x86: Emulate split-lock access as a write in emulator

Emulate split-lock accesses as writes if split lock detection is on
to avoid #AC during emulation, which will result in a panic(). This
should never occur for a well-behaved guest, but a malicious guest can
manipulate the TLB to trigger emulation of a locked instruction[1].
