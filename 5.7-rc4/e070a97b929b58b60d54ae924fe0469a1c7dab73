Input: goodix - make loading the config from disk independent from the GPIO setup

At least on X86 ACPI platforms it is not necessary to load the touchscreen
controller config from disk, if it needs to be loaded this has already been
done by the BIOS / UEFI firmware.

Even on other (e.g. devicetree) platforms the config-loading as currently
done has the issue that the loaded cfg file is based on the controller
model, but the actual cfg is device specific, so the cfg files are not
part of linux-firmware and this can only work with a device specific OS
image which includes the cfg file.

And we do not need access to the GPIOs at all to load the config, if we
do not have access we can still load the config.

So all in all tying the decision to try to load the config from disk to
being able to access the GPIOs is not desirable. This commit adds a new
load_cfg_from_disk boolean to control the firmware loading instead.

This commits sets the new bool to true when we set irq_pin_access_method
to IRQ_PIN_ACCESS_GPIO, so there are no functional changes.
