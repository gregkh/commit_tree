sysfs: remove redundant __compat_only_sysfs_link_entry_to_kobj fn

Commit 9255782f7061 ("sysfs: Wrap __compat_only_sysfs_link_entry_to_kobj
function to change the symlink name") made this function a wrapper
around a new non-underscored function, which is a bit odd.  The normal
naming convention is the other way around: the underscored function is
the wrappee, and the non-underscored function is the wrapper.

There's only one single user (well, two call-sites in that user) of the
more limited double underscore version of this function, so just remove
the oddly named wrapper entirely and just add the extra NULL argument to
the user.

I considered just doing that in the merge, but that tends to make
history really hard to read.
