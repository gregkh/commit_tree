xhci: Wait until link state trainsits to U0 after setting USB_SS_PORT_LS_U0

Like U3 case, xHCI spec doesn't specify the upper bound of U0 transition
time. The 20ms is not enough for some devices.

Intead of polling PLS or PLC, we can facilitate the port change event to
know that the link transits to U0 is completed.

While at it, also separate U0 and U3 case to make the code cleaner.

[variable rename to u3exit, and skip completion for usb2 ports -Mathias ]
