drm/meson: venc: add support for YUV420 setup

This patch adds encoding support for the YUV420 output from the
Amlogic Meson SoCs Video Processing Unit to the HDMI Controller.

The YUV420 is obtained by generating a YUV444 pixel stream like
the classic HDMI display modes, but then the Video Encoder output
can be configured to down-sample the YUV444 pixel stream to a YUV420
stream.

In addition if pixel stream down-sampling, the Y Cb Cr components must
also be mapped differently to align with the HDMI2.0 specifications.
