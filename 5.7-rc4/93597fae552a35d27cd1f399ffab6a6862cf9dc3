ASoC: soc-pcm: use dai_get_widget() at dpcm_get_be()

dpcm_get_be() has very duplicate code.

	dpcm_get_be() {
		...
		if (stream == SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK) {
(1)			/* code for Playback */
		} else  {
(2)			/* code for Capture */
		}
	}

The difference between Playback (1) and Capture (2) code is pointer only
(= "playback_widget" or "caputre_widget").
OTOH, now we already has dai_get_widget() for it.
This means we can merge (1) and (2).
This patch do it and remove duplicated code.
