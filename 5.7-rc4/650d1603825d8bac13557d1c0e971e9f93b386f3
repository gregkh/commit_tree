soc: qcom: ipa: the generic software interface

This patch includes "gsi.c", which implements the generic software
interface (GSI) for IPA.  The generic software interface abstracts
channels, which provide a means of transferring data either from the
AP to the IPA, or from the IPA to the AP.  A ring buffer of "transfer
elements" (TREs) is used to describe data transfers to perform.  The
AP writes a doorbell register associated with a channel to let it know
it has added new entries (for an AP->IPA channel) or has finished
processing entries (for an IPA->AP channel).

Each channel also has an event ring buffer, used by the IPA to
communicate information about events related to a channel (for
example, the completion of TREs).  The IPA writes its own doorbell
register, which triggers an interrupt on the AP, to signal that
new event information has arrived.
