driver core: Add fw_devlink kernel commandline option

fwnode_operations.add_links allows creating device links from
information provided by firmware.

fwnode_operations.add_links is currently implemented only by
OF/devicetree code and a specific case of efi. However, there's nothing
preventing ACPI or other firmware types from implementing it.

The OF implementation is currently controlled by a kernel commandline
parameter called of_devlink.

Since this feature is generic isn't limited to OF, add a generic
fw_devlink kernel commandline parameter to control this feature across
firmware types.
