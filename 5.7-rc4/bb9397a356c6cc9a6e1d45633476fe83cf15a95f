staging: exfat: remove symlink feature.

Remove symlink feature completely.

Becouse
-Uses reserved areas(defined in the Microsoft exfat specification), causing future incompatibilities.
-Not described in Microsoft exfat specifications or SD standards.
-For REMOVABLE media, causes incompatibility with other implementations.
-Not supported by other major exfat drivers.
-Not implemented symlink feature in linux FAT/VFAT.

Remove this feature completely because of serious media compatibility issues.
