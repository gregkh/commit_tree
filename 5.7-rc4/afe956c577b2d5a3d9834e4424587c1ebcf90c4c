kbuild: Enable -Wtautological-compare

Currently, we disable -Wtautological-compare, which in turn disables a
bunch of more specific tautological comparison warnings that are useful
for the kernel such as -Wtautological-bitwise-compare. See clang's
documentation below for the other warnings that are suppressed by
-Wtautological-compare. Now that all of the major/noisy warnings have
been fixed, enable -Wtautological-compare so that more issues can be
caught at build time by various continuous integration setups.

-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare is kept disabled under a
normal build but visible at W=1 because there are places in the kernel
where a constant or variable size can change based on the kernel
configuration. These are not fixed in a clean/concise way and the ones
I have audited so far appear to be harmless. It is not a subgroup but
rather just one warning so we do not lose out on much coverage by
default.
