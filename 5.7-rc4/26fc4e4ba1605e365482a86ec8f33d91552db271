drm/i915: Always propagate the invocation to i915_schedule

We only call i915_schedule() when we know we have changed the priority
on a request and so require to propagate any change in priority to its
signalers (for PI). By unconditionally checking all of our signalers, we
avoid skipping changes made prior to construction of the request (as the
request may be waited upon before submission when used in parallel).
