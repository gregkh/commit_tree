x86, vmlinux.lds: Add RUNTIME_DISCARD_EXIT to generic DISCARDS

In the x86 kernel, .exit.text and .exit.data sections are discarded at
runtime, not by the linker. Add RUNTIME_DISCARD_EXIT to generic DISCARDS
and define it in the x86 kernel linker script to keep them.

The sections are added before the DISCARD directive so document here
only the situation explicitly as this change doesn't have any effect on
the generated kernel. Also, other architectures like ARM64 will use it
too so generalize the approach with the RUNTIME_DISCARD_EXIT define.
