usb-storage: Add unusual_devs entry for JMicron JMS566

Cyril Roelandt reports that his JMicron JMS566 USB-SATA bridge fails
to handle WRITE commands with the FUA bit set, even though it claims
to support FUA.  (Oddly enough, a later version of the same bridge,
version 2.03 as opposed to 1.14, doesn't claim to support FUA.  Also
oddly, the bridge _does_ support FUA when using the UAS transport
instead of the Bulk-Only transport -- but this device was blacklisted
for uas in commit bc3bdb12bbb3 ("usb-storage: Disable UAS on JMicron
SATA enclosure") for apparently unrelated reasons.)

This patch adds a usb-storage unusual_devs entry with the BROKEN_FUA
flag.  This allows the bridge to work properly with usb-storage.
