scsi: lpfc: Fix crash in target side cable pulls hitting WAIT_FOR_UNREG

Kernel is crashing with the following stacktrace:

During target side fault injections, it is possible to hit the
NLP_WAIT_FOR_UNREG case in lpfc_nvme_remoteport_delete. A prior commit
fixed a rebind and delete race condition, but called lpfc_nlp_put
unconditionally. This triggered a deletion and the crash.

Fix by movng nlp_put to inside the NLP_WAIT_FOR_UNREG case, where the nlp
will be being unregistered/removed. Leave the reference if the flag isn't
set.
