xfs: remove the aborted parameter to xlog_state_done_syncing

We can just check for a shut down log all the way down in
xlog_cil_committed instead of passing the parameter.  This means a
slight behavior change in that we now also abort log items if the
shutdown came in halfway into the I/O completion processing, which
actually is the right thing to do.
