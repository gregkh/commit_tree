KVM: x86: Check for CPUID 0xD.N support before validating array size

Now that sub-leaf 1 is handled separately, verify the next sub-leaf is
needed before rejecting KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID due to an insufficiently
sized userspace array.

Note, although this is technically a bug, it's not visible to userspace
as KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID is guaranteed to fail on KVM_CPUID_SIGNATURE,
which is hardcoded to be added after leaf 0xD.  The real motivation for
the change is to tightly couple the nent/maxnent and do_host_cpuid()
sequences in preparation for future cleanup.
