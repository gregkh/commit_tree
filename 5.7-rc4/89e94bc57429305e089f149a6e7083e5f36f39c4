In some display configuration like 1080P monitor playing a 1080P video,
if user use ALT+F4 to exit Movie and TV, there is a chance clocks are
same only water mark changed. Current clock optimization machanism will
result in water mark keeps high after exit Movie and TV app.

perform the optimization after.
