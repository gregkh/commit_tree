irqchip/sifive-plic: Enable/Disable external interrupts upon cpu online/offline

Currently, PLIC threshold is only initialized once in the beginning.
However, threshold can be set to disabled if a CPU is marked offline with
CPU hotplug feature. This will not allow to change the irq affinity to a
CPU that just came online.

Add PLIC specific CPU hotplug callbacks and enable the threshold when a CPU
comes online. Take this opportunity to move the external interrupt enable
code from trap init to PLIC driver as well. On cpu offline path, the driver
performs the exact opposite operations i.e. disable the interrupt and
the threshold.
