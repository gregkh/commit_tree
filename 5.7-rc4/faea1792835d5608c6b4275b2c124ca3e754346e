drm/i915: extract engine WA programming to common resume function

The workarounds are a common "feature" across gens and submission
mechanisms and we already call the other WA related functions from
common engine ones (<setup/cleanup>_common), so it makes sense to
do the same with WA application. Medium-term, This will help us
reduce the duplication once the GuC resume function is added, but short
term it will also allow us to use the workaround lists for pre-gen8
engine workarounds.
