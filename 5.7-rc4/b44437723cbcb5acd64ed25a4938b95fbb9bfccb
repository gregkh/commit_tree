mm/vma: move VM_NO_KHUGEPAGED into generic header

Patch series "mm/vma: some more minor changes", v2.

The motivation here is to consolidate VMA flags and helpers in generic
memory header and reduce code duplication when ever applicable.  If there
are other possible similar instances which might be missing here, please
do let me me know.  I will be happy to incorporate them.

This patch (of 3):

Move VM_NO_KHUGEPAGED into generic header (include/linux/mm.h).  This just
makes sure that no VMA flag is scattered in individual function files any
longer.  While at this, fix an old comment which is no longer valid.  This
should not cause any functional change.
