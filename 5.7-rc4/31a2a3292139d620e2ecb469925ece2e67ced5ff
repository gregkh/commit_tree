fbdev: remove object duplication in Makefile

The objects in $(fb-objs) $(fb-y) $(fb-m) are linked to fb.ko .

This line adds $(fb-y) to fb-objs, so the objects from $(fb-y) are
listed twice as the dependency of the module.

It works because Kbuild trims the duplicated objects from linking,
but there is no good reason to have this line.
