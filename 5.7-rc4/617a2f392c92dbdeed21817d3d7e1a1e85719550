arm64: kvm: Annotate assembly using modern annoations

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotation of assembly functions
in the kernel new macros have been introduced. These replace ENTRY and
ENDPROC with separate annotations for standard C callable functions,
data and code with different calling conventions.  Update the more
straightforward annotations in the kvm code to the new macros.
