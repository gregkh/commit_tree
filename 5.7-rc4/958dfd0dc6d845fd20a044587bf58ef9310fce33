net/mlxfw: Add reactivate flow support to FSM burn flow

Expose fsm_reactivate callback to the mlxfw_dev_ops struct. FSM reactivate
is needed before flashing the new image in order to flush the old flashed
but not running firmware image.

In case mlxfw_dev do not support the reactivation, this step will be
skipped. But if later image flash will fail, a hint will be provided by
the extack to advise the user that the failure might be related to it.
