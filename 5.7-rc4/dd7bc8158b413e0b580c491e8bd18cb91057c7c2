Fix use after free in get_tree_bdev()

Commit 6fcf0c72e4b9, a fix to get_tree_bdev() put a missing blkdev_put() in
the wrong place, before a warnf() that displays the bdev under
consideration rather after it.

This results in a silent lockup in printk("%pg") called via warnf() from
get_tree_bdev() under some circumstances when there's a race with the
blockdev being frozen.  This can be caused by xfstests/tests/generic/085 in
combination with Lukas Czerner's ext4 mount API conversion patchset.  It
looks like it ought to occur with other users of get_tree_bdev() such as
XFS, but apparently doesn't.

Fix this by switching the order of the lines.
