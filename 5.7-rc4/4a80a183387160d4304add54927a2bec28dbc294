ice: let core reject the unsupported coalescing parameters

Set ethtool_ops->supported_coalesce_params to let
the core reject unsupported coalescing parameters.

This driver correctly rejects all unsupported parameters.
As a side effect of these changes the info message about
the bad parameter will no longer be printed. We also
always reject the tx_coalesce_usecs_high param, even
if the target queue pair does not have a TX queue.
Error code changes from EINVAL to EOPNOTSUPP.

v2: allow adaptive TX
v3: adjust commit message for new error code and member name
