clk: sunxi-ng: sun8i-de2: Don't reuse A83T resets

Currently, V3s and H3 reuse A83T reset structure. However, A83T contains
additional core for rotation, which is not present in V3s and H3.

Make new reset structure for H3 and let V3s reuse it. A83T reset
structure will be amended in subsequent commit.
