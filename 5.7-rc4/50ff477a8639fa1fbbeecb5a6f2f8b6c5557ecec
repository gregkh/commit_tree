mac80211: add 802.11 encapsulation offloading support

This patch adds a new transmit path for hardware that supports 802.11
encapsulation offloading. In those cases 802.3 frames get passed
directly to the driver allowing the hardware to handle the encapsulation.
Some features such as monitor mode and TKIP would break when encapsulation
offloading is enabled. If any of these get enabled, the code will alwyas
fallback to the normal sw encapsulation data path.

The patch defines a secondary netdev_ops struct that the device gets
assigned if 802.11 encap support is available and enabled. The driver
needs to enable the support on a per vif basis if it finds that all
pre-reqs are meet.
