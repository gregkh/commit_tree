hugetlb: support file_region coalescing again

An earlier patch in this series disabled file_region coalescing in order
to hang the hugetlb_cgroup uncharge info on the file_region entries.

This patch re-adds support for coalescing of file_region entries.
Essentially everytime we add an entry, we call a recursive function that
tries to coalesce the added region with the regions next to it.  The worst
case call depth for this function is 3: one to coalesce with the region
next to it, one to coalesce to the region prev, and one to reach the base
case.

This is an important performance optimization as private mappings add
their entries page by page, and we could incur big performance costs for
large mappings with lots of file_region entries in their resv_map.
