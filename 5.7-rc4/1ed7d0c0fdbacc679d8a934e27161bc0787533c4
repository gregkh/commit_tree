soc: qcom: ipa: configuration data

This patch defines configuration data that is used to specify some
of the details of IPA hardware supported by the driver.  It is built
as Device Tree match data, discovered at boot time.  The driver
supports the Qualcomm SDM845 SoC.  Data for the Qualcomm SC7180 is
also defined here, but it is not yet completely supported.
