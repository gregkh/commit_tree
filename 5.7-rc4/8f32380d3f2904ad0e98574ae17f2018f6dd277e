btrfs: use the page cache for super block reading

Super-block reading in BTRFS is done using buffer_heads. Buffer_heads
have some drawbacks, like not being able to propagate errors from the
lower layers.

Directly use the page cache for reading the super blocks from disk or
invalidating an on-disk super block. We have to use the page cache so to
avoid races between mkfs and udev. See also 6f60cbd3ae44 ("btrfs: access
superblock via pagecache in scan_one_device").

This patch unwraps the buffer head API and does not change the way the
super block is actually read.
