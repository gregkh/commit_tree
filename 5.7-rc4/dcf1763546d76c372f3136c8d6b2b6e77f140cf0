mm/mempolicy: support MPOL_MF_STRICT for huge page mapping

MPOL_MF_STRICT is used in mbind() for purposes:

(1) MPOL_MF_STRICT is set alone without MPOL_MF_MOVE or
    MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL, to check if there is misplaced page and return -EIO;

(2) MPOL_MF_STRICT is set with MPOL_MF_MOVE or MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL, to
    check if there is misplaced page which is failed to isolate, or page
    is success on isolate but failed to move, and return -EIO.

For non hugepage mapping, (1) and (2) are implemented as expectation.  For
hugepage mapping, (1) is not implemented.  And in (2), the part about
failed to isolate and report -EIO is not implemented.

This patch implements the missed parts for hugepage mapping.  Benefits
with it applied:

- User space can apply same code logic to handle mbind() on hugepage and
  non hugepage mapping;

- Reliably using MPOL_MF_STRICT alone to check whether there is
  misplaced page or not when bind policy on address range, especially for
  address range which contains both hugepage and non hugepage mapping.

Analysis of potential impact to existing users:

- If MPOL_MF_STRICT alone was previously used, hugetlb pages not
  following the memory policy would not cause an EIO error.  After this
  change, hugetlb pages are treated like all other pages.  If
  MPOL_MF_STRICT alone is used and hugetlb pages do not follow memory
  policy an EIO error will be returned.

- For users who using MPOL_MF_STRICT with MPOL_MF_MOVE or
  MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL, the semantic about some pages could not be moved will
  not be changed by this patch, because failed to isolate and failed to
  move have same effects to users, so their existing code will not be
  impacted.

In mbind man page, the note about 'MPOL_MF_STRICT is ignored on huge page
mappings' can be removed after this patch is applied.

Mike:

: The current behavior with MPOL_MF_STRICT and hugetlb pages is inconsistent
: and does not match documentation (as described above).  The special
: behavior for hugetlb pages ideally should have been removed when hugetlb
: page migration was introduced.  It is unlikely that anyone relies on
: today's inconsistent behavior, and removing one more case of special
: handling for hugetlb pages is a good thing.
