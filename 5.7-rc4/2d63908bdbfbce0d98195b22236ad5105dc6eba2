watchdog: Add K3 RTI watchdog support

Texas Instruments K3 SoCs contain an RTI (Real Time Interrupt) module
which can be used as a watchdog. This IP provides a support for
windowed watchdog mode, in which the watchdog must be petted within
a certain time window. If it is petted either too soon, or too late,
a watchdog error will be triggered.
