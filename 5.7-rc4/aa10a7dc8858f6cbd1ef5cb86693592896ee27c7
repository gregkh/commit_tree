KVM: x86: Consolidate CPUID array max num entries checking

Move the nent vs. maxnent check and nent increment into do_host_cpuid()
to consolidate what is now identical code.  To signal success vs.
failure, return the entry and NULL respectively.  A future patch will
build on this to also move the entry retrieval into do_host_cpuid().

No functional change intended.
