mtd: spi-nor: split spi_nor_spimem_xfer_data()

spi_nor_spimem_xfer_data() being a helper function for the data reads/
writes contains 3 fragments that depend on the data direction; and I'm
going to add another one to call the SPI dirmap API...
I think this function should be split so that the common fragments are
put into 2 functions, spi_nor_spimem_bounce() and spi_nor_spimem_exec_op()
called from spi_nor_spimem_{read|write}_data(), and the data direction
dependent bits moved back into those read/write functions -- that way we
would be able to avoid *goto*s otherwise needed in the next patch adding
the SPI dirmap support...
