thermal/cpu-cooling: Update thermal pressure in case of a maximum frequency capping

Thermal governors can request for a CPU's maximum supported frequency to
be capped in case of an overheat event. This in turn means that the
maximum capacity available for tasks to run on the particular CPU is
reduced. Delta between the original maximum capacity and capped maximum
capacity is known as thermal pressure. Enable cpufreq cooling device to
update the thermal pressure in event of a capped maximum frequency.
