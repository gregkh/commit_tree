btrfs: factor out inode items copy loop from btrfs_log_inode()

The function btrfs_log_inode() is quite large and so is its loop which
iterates the inode items from the fs/subvolume tree and copies them into
a log tree. Because this is a large loop inside a very large function
and because an upcoming patch in this series needs to add some more logic
inside that loop, move the loop into a helper function to make it a bit
more manageable.
