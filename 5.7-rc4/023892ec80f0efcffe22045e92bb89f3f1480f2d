gpio: siox: use raw spinlock for irq related locking

All the irq related callbacks are called with the (raw) spinlock
desc->lock being held. So the lock here must be raw as well. Also irqs
were already disabled by the caller for the irq chip callbacks, so the
non-irq variants of spin_lock must be used there.
