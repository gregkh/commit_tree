net-sysfs: add queue_change_owner()

Add a function to change the owner of the queue entries for a network device
when it is moved between network namespaces.

Currently, when moving network devices between network namespaces the
ownership of the corresponding queue sysfs entries are not changed. This leads
to problems when tools try to operate on the corresponding sysfs files. Fix
this.
