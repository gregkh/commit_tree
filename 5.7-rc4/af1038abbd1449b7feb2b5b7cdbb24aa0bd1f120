erofs: use LZ4_decompress_safe() for full decoding

As Lasse pointed out, "EROFS uses LZ4_decompress_safe_partial
for both partial and full blocks. Thus when it is decoding a
full block, it doesn't know if the LZ4 decoder actually decoded
all the input. The real uncompressed size could be bigger than
the value stored in the file system metadata.

Using LZ4_decompress_safe instead of _safe_partial when
decompressing a full block would help to detect errors."

So it's reasonable to use _safe in case of potential corrupted
images and it might have some speed gain as well although
I didn't observe much difference.

Note that legacy compressor (< 5.3, no LZ4_0PADDING) could
encode extra data in a pcluster, which is excluded as well.
