scsi: qla2xxx: Update BPM enablement semantics.

commit e4e3a2ce9556 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Add ability to autodetect SFP
type") takes a heavy handed approach to BPM (Buffer Plus Management)
enablement:

1) During hardware initialization, if an LR-capable transceiver is
   recognized, the driver schedules a disruptive post-initialization
   chip-reset (ISP-ABORT) to allow the BPM settings to be sent to the
   firmware.  This chip-reset will result in (short-term) path-loss to
   all fc-rports and their attached SCSI devices.

2) LR-detection is triggered during any link-up event, resulting in a
   refresh and potential chip-reset

Based on firmware-team guidance, upon LR-capable transceiver
recognition, the driver's hardware initialization code will now
re-execute firmware with the new BPM settings, then continue on with
driver initialization.  To address the second issue, the driver
performs LR-capable detection upon the driver receiving a
transceiver-insertion asynchronous event from firmware.  No short-term
path loss is needed with this new semantic.
