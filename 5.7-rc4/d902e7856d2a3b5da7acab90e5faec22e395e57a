ASoC: wcd9335: fix address map representation

slimbus addresses are 16 bit wide, masking page numbers
to wcd register at offset of 12 will limit the number for pages.
So it becomes impossible to write to page 0x10 registers.
Remove masking 0x800 (slimbus address range) from register address
and making use of window parameters in regmap config should fix it
and also will represent the registers exactly inline with Datasheet.

Remove this unnessary masking and make the registers be inline
with datasheet.
