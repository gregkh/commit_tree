scsi: zfcp: trace FC Endpoint Security of FCP devices and connections

Trace changes in Fibre Channel Endpoint Security capabilities of FCP
devices as well as changes in Fibre Channel Endpoint Security state of
their connections to FC remote ports as FC Endpoint Security changes with
trace level 3 in HBA DBF.

A change in FC Endpoint Security capabilities of FCP devices is traced as
response to FSF command FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_PORT_DATA with a trace tag of
"fsfcesa" and a WWPN of ZFCP_DBF_INVALID_WWPN = 0x0000000000000000 (see
FC-FS-4 ยง18 "Name_Identifier Formats", NAA field).

A change in FC Endpoint Security state of connections between FCP devices
and FC remote ports is traced as response to FSF command
FSF_QTCB_OPEN_PORT_WITH_DID with a trace tag of "fsfcesp".

Example trace record of FC Endpoint Security capability change of FCP
device formatted with zfcpdbf from s390-tools:
