posix-cpu-timers: Stop disabling timers on mt-exec

The reasons why the extra posix_cpu_timers_exit_group() invocation has been
added are not entirely clear from the commit message.  Today all that
posix_cpu_timers_exit_group() does is stop timers that are tracking the
task from firing.  Every other operation on those timers is still allowed.

The practical implication of this is posix_cpu_timer_del() which could
not get the siglock after the thread group leader has exited (because
sighand == NULL) would be able to run successfully because the timer
was already dequeued.

With that locking issue fixed there is no point in disabling all of the
timers.  So remove this ``tempoary'' hack.
