devlink: extract snapshot id allocation to helper function

A future change is going to implement a new devlink command to request
a snapshot on demand. As part of this, the logic for handling the
snapshot ids will be refactored. To simplify the snapshot id allocation
function, move it to a separate function prefixed by `__`. This helper
function will assume the lock is held.

While no other callers will exist, it simplifies refactoring the logic
because there is no need to complicate the function with gotos to handle
unlocking on failure.
