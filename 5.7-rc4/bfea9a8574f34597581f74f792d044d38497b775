bpf: Add name to struct bpf_ksym

Adding name to 'struct bpf_ksym' object to carry the name
of the symbol for bpf_prog, bpf_trampoline, bpf_dispatcher
objects.

The current benefit is that name is now generated only when
the symbol is added to the list, so we don't need to generate
it every time it's accessed.

The future benefit is that we will have all the bpf objects
symbols represented by struct bpf_ksym.
