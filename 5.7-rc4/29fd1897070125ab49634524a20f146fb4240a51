mm: make it clear that gfp reclaim modifiers are valid only for sleepable allocations

While it might be really clear to MM developers that gfp reclaim modifiers
are applicable only to sleepable allocations (those with
__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM) it seems that actual users of the API are not always
sure.  Make it explicit that they are not applicable for GFP_NOWAIT or
GFP_ATOMIC allocations which are the most commonly used non-sleepable
allocation masks.
