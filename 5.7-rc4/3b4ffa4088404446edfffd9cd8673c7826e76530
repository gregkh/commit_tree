btrfs: refactor find_free_dev_extent_start()

Factor out two functions from find_free_dev_extent_start().
dev_extent_search_start() decides the starting position of the search.
dev_extent_hole_check() checks if a hole found is suitable for device
extent allocation.

These functions also have the switch-cases to change the allocation
behavior depending on the policy.
