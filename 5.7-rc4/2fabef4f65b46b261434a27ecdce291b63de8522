net/rds: Fix MR reference counting problem

In rds_free_mr(), it calls rds_destroy_mr(mr) directly.  But this
defeats the purpose of reference counting and makes MR free handling
impossible.  It means that holding a reference does not guarantee that
it is safe to access some fields.  For example, In
rds_cmsg_rdma_dest(), it increases the ref count, unlocks and then
calls mr->r_trans->sync_mr().  But if rds_free_mr() (and
rds_destroy_mr()) is called in between (there is no lock preventing
this to happen), r_trans_private is set to NULL, causing a panic.
Similar issue is in rds_rdma_unuse().
