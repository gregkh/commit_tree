usb: raw-gadget: fix raw_event_queue_fetch locking

If queue->size check in raw_event_queue_fetch() fails (which normally
shouldn't happen, that check is a fail-safe), the function returns
without reenabling interrupts. This patch fixes that issue, along with
propagating the cause of failure to the function caller.
