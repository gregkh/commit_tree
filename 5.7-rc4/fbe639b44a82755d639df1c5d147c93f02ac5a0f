soc: qcom: Introduce Protection Domain Restart helpers

Qualcomm SoCs (starting with MSM8998) allow for multiple protection domains
to run on the same Q6 sub-system. This allows for services like ATH10K WLAN
FW to have their own separate address space and crash/recover without
disrupting the modem and other PDs running on the same sub-system. The PDR
helpers introduces an abstraction that allows for tracking/controlling the
life cycle of protection domains running on various Q6 sub-systems.
