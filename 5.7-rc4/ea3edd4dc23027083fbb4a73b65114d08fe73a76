block: remove __bdevname

There is no good reason for __bdevname to exist.  Just open code
printing the string in the callers.  For three of them the format
string can be trivially merged into existing printk statements,
and in init/do_mounts.c we can at least do the scnprintf once at
the start of the function, and unconditional of CONFIG_BLOCK to
make the output for tiny configfs a little more helpful.
