drm/mediatek: fix race condition for HDMI jack status reporting

hdmi_conn_detect and mtk_hdmi_audio_hook_plugged_cb would be called
by different threads.

Imaging the following calling sequence:
           Thread A                            Thread B
--------------------------------------------------------------------
mtk_hdmi_audio_hook_plugged_cb()
mtk_cec_hpd_high() -> disconnected
                                     hdmi_conn_detect()
                                     mtk_cec_hpd_high() -> connected
                                     plugged_cb(connected)
plugged_cb(disconnected)

The latest disconnected is false reported.  Makes mtk_cec_hpd_high
and plugged_cb atomic to fix.

Also uses the same lock to protect read/write of plugged_cb and codec_dev.
