drm/i915: Return early for await_start on same timeline

Requests within a timeline are ordered by that timeline, so awaiting for
the start of a request within the timeline is a no-op. This used to work
by falling out of the mutex_trylock() as the signaler and waiter had the
same timeline and not returning an error.
