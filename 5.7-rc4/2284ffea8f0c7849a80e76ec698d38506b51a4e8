powerpc/64s/exception: Only test KVM in SRR interrupts when PR KVM is supported

Apart from SRESET, MCE, and syscall (hcall variant), the SRR type
interrupts are not escalated to hypervisor mode, so are delivered to
the OS.

When running PR KVM, the OS is the hypervisor, and the guest runs with
MSR[PR]=1 (ie. usermode), so these interrupts must test if a guest was
running when interrupted. These tests are required at the real-mode
entry points because the PR KVM host runs with LPCR[AIL]=0.

In HV KVM and nested HV KVM, the guest always receives these
interrupts, so there is no need for the host to make this test. So
remove the tests if PR KVM is not configured.
