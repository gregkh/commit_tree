mmc: tmio: refactor tuning execution into SDHI driver

Move Renesas specific code for executing the tuning with a SCC into the
SDHI driver and leave only a generic call in the TMIO driver. Simplify
the code a little by removing init_tuning() and prepare_tuning()
callbacks. The latter is directly folded into the new execute_tuning()
callbacks.
