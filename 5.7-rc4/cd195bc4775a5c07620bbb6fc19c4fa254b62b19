kbuild: split adjust_autoksyms.sh in two parts

In order to prepare the ground for a build-time optimization, split
adjust_autoksyms.sh into two scripts: one that generates autoksyms.h
based on all currently available information (whitelist, and .mod
files), and the other to inspect the diff between two versions of
autoksyms.h and trigger appropriate rebuilds.
