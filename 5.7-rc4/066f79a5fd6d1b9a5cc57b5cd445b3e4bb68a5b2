scsi: target: tcmu: reset_ring should reset TCMU_DEV_BIT_BROKEN

In case command ring buffer becomes inconsistent, tcmu sets device flag
TCMU_DEV_BIT_BROKEN.  If the bit is set, tcmu rejects new commands from LIO
core with TCM_LOGICAL_UNIT_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE, and no longer processes
completions from the ring.  The reset_ring attribute can be used to
completely clean up the command ring, so after reset_ring the ring no
longer is inconsistent.

Therefore reset_ring also should reset bit TCMU_DEV_BIT_BROKEN to allow
normal processing.
