tracing: Remove unused TRACE_BUFFER bits

Commit 567cd4da54ff ("ring-buffer: User context bit recursion checking")
added the TRACE_BUFFER bits to be used in the current task's trace_recursion
field. But the final submission of the logic removed the use of those bits,
but never removed the bits themselves (they were never used in upstream
Linux). These can be safely removed.
