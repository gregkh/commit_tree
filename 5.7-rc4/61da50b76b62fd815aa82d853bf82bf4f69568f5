powerpc/kuap: PPC_KUAP_DEBUG should depend on PPC_KUAP

Currently you can enable PPC_KUAP_DEBUG when PPC_KUAP is disabled,
even though the former has not effect without the latter.

Fix it so that PPC_KUAP_DEBUG can only be enabled when PPC_KUAP is
enabled, not when the platform could support KUAP (PPC_HAVE_KUAP).
