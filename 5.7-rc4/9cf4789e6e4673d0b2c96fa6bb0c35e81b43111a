rtc: 88pm860x: fix possible race condition

The RTC IRQ is requested before the struct rtc_device is allocated,
this may lead to a NULL pointer dereference in the IRQ handler.

To fix this issue, allocating the rtc_device struct before requesting
the RTC IRQ using devm_rtc_allocate_device, and use rtc_register_device
to register the RTC device.

Also remove the unnecessary error message as the core already prints the
info.
