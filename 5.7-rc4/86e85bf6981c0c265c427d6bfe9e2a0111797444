sfc: fix XDP-redirect in this driver

XDP-redirect is broken in this driver sfc. XDP_REDIRECT requires
tailroom for skb_shared_info when creating an SKB based on the
redirected xdp_frame (both in cpumap and veth).

The fix requires some initial explaining. The driver uses RX page-split
when possible. It reserves the top 64 bytes in the RX-page for storing
dma_addr (struct efx_rx_page_state). It also have the XDP recommended
headroom of XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM (256 bytes). As it doesn't reserve any
tailroom, it can still fit two standard MTU (1500) frames into one page.

The sizeof struct skb_shared_info in 320 bytes. Thus drivers like ixgbe
and i40e, reduce their XDP headroom to 192 bytes, which allows them to
fit two frames with max 1536 bytes into a 4K page (192+1536+320=2048).

The fix is to reduce this drivers headroom to 128 bytes and add the 320
bytes tailroom. This account for reserved top 64 bytes in the page, and
still fit two frame in a page for normal MTUs.

We must never go below 128 bytes of headroom for XDP, as one cacheline
is for xdp_frame area and next cacheline is reserved for metadata area.
