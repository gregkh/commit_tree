riscv: force hart_lottery to put in .sdata section

In PIC code model, the zero initialized data always be put in .bss
section, so when building kernel as PIE, the hart_lottery won't present
in small data section, and it causes more than one harts to get the
lottery, because the main hart clears the content of .bss section
immediately after it getting the lottery.
