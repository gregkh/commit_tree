io_uring: Fix ->data corruption on re-enqueue

work->data and work->list are shared in union. io_wq_assign_next() sets
->data if a req having a linked_timeout, but then io-wq may want to use
work->list, e.g. to do re-enqueue of a request, so corrupting ->data.

->data is not necessary, just remove it and extract linked_timeout
through @link_list.
