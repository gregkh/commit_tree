bpf, x86: Fix encoding for lower 8-bit registers in BPF_STX BPF_B

This patch fixes an encoding bug in emit_stx for BPF_B when the source
register is BPF_REG_FP.

The current implementation for BPF_STX BPF_B in emit_stx saves one REX
byte when the operands can be encoded using Mod-R/M alone. The lower 8
bits of registers %rax, %rbx, %rcx, and %rdx can be accessed without using
a REX prefix via %al, %bl, %cl, and %dl, respectively. Other registers,
(e.g., %rsi, %rdi, %rbp, %rsp) require a REX prefix to use their 8-bit
equivalents (%sil, %dil, %bpl, %spl).

The current code checks if the source for BPF_STX BPF_B is BPF_REG_1
or BPF_REG_2 (which map to %rdi and %rsi), in which case it emits the
required REX prefix. However, it misses the case when the source is
BPF_REG_FP (mapped to %rbp).

The result is that BPF_STX BPF_B with BPF_REG_FP as the source operand
will read from register %ch instead of the correct %bpl. This patch fixes
the problem by fixing and refactoring the check on which registers need
the extra REX byte. Since no BPF registers map to %rsp, there is no need
to handle %spl.
