ASoC: sgtl5000: Fix VAG power-on handling

As mentioned slightly out of patch context in the code, there
is no reset routine for the chip. On boards where the chip is
supplied by a fixed regulator, it might not even be resetted
during (e.g. watchdog) reboot and can be in any state.

If the device is probed with VAG enabled, the driver's probe
routine will generate a loud pop sound when ANA_POWER is
being programmed. Avoid this by properly disabling just the
VAG bit and waiting the required power down time.
