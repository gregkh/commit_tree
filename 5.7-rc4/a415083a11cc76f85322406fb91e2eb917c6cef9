usb: dwc2: add support for STM32MP15 SoCs USB OTG HS and FS

This patch introduces a new parameter to activate external ID pin and valid
vbus level detection, required on STM32MP15 SoC to support dual role,
either in HS or FS.
The STM32MP15 SoC uses the GGPIO register to enable the level detection.
The level detector requires to be powered.
Also adds the params structures for STM32MP15 OTG HS and STM32MP1 OTG FS.
