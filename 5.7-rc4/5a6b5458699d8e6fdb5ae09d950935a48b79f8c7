drm/amd/display: LFC not working on 2.0x range monitors (v2)

[Why]
Nominal pixel clock and EDID information differ in precision so although
monitor reports maximum refresh is 2x minimum, LFC was not being
enabled.

[How]
Use minimum refresh rate as nominal/2 when EDID dictates that min
refresh = max refresh/2.

v2: squash in 64 bit divide fix
