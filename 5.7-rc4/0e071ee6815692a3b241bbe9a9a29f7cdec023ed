m68k: mm: Extend table allocator for multiple sizes

In addition to the PGD/PMD table size (128*4) add a PTE table size
(64*4) to the table allocator. This completely removes the pte-table
overhead compared to the old code, even for dense tables.

Notes:

 - the allocator gained a list_empty() check to deal with there not
   being any pages at all.

 - the free mask is extended to cover more than the 8 bits required
   for the (512 byte) PGD/PMD tables.

 - NR_PAGETABLE accounting is restored.
