mptcp: defer work schedule until mptcp lock is released

Don't schedule the work queue right away, instead defer this
to the lock release callback.

This has the advantage that it will give recv path a chance to
complete -- this might have moved all pending packets from the
subflow to the mptcp receive queue, which allows to avoid the
schedule_work().
