ARM: dts: exynos: Fix G3D power domain supply on Arndale Octa boards

G3D power domain in Exynos5420 SoC is supplied from PVDD_G3DS_1V0 and
PVDD_G3D_1V0. Besides the main GPU MALI module it also contains the power
domain control logic and clocks. Turning the power supplies off causes
the power domain to fail to operate properly if GPU drivers are loaded as
modules. GPU should use PVDD_G3D_1V0 supply mainly to control the DVFS.
