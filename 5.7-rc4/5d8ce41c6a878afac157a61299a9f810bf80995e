s390/qeth: balance the TX queue selection for IQD devices

For ucast traffic, qeth_iqd_select_queue() falls back to
netdev_pick_tx(). This will potentially use skb_tx_hash() to distribute
the flow over all active TX queues - so txq 0 is a valid selection, and
qeth_iqd_select_queue() needs to check for this and put it on some other
queue. As a result, the distribution for ucast flows is unbalanced and
hits QETH_IQD_MIN_UCAST_TXQ heavier than the other queues.

Open-coding a custom variant of skb_tx_hash() isn't an option, since
netdev_pick_tx() also gives us eg. access to XPS. But we can pull a
little trick: add a single TC class that excludes the mcast txq, and
thus encourage skb_tx_hash() to not pick the mcast txq.
