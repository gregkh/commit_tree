soundwire: bus: add helper to clear Slave status to UNATTACHED

When resuming with a bus reset, we need to re-enumerate and restart
from UNATTACHED. The helper added in this patch helps implement a more
robust state machine avoiding race conditions on resume.

The unattach request is stored and will be used by Slave drivers, if
needed: Intel validation exposed a corner case where the Slave device
may transition to D3 when streaming stops, but streaming restarts
before the Master transitions to D3. In that case, the Slave status
was not cleared as UNATTACHED by the Master resuming, and the
wait_for_completion will time out.

When the slave resumes, it can check if a Master-initiated
re-enumeration and initialization took place and skip the
wait_for_completion() if there is no reason to wait.
