bpf: Use recursion prevention helpers in hashtab code

The required protection is that the caller cannot be migrated to a
different CPU as these places take either a hash bucket lock or might
trigger a kprobe inside the memory allocator. Both scenarios can lead to
deadlocks. The deadlock prevention is per CPU by incrementing a per CPU
variable which temporarily blocks the invocation of BPF programs from perf
and kprobes.

Replace the open coded preempt_disable/enable() and this_cpu_inc/dec()
pairs with the new recursion prevention helpers to prepare BPF to work on
PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels. On a non-RT kernel the migrate disable/enable
in the helpers map to preempt_disable/enable(), i.e. no functional change.
