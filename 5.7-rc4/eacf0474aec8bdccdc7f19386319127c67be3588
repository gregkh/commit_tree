x86, sched: Add support for frequency invariance on ATOM_GOLDMONT*

The scheduler needs the ratio freq_curr/freq_max for frequency-invariant
accounting. On GOLDMONT (aka Apollo Lake), GOLDMONT_D (aka Denverton) and
GOLDMONT_PLUS CPUs (aka Gemini Lake) set freq_max to the highest frequency
reported by the CPU.

The encoding of turbo ratios for GOLDMONT* is identical to the one for
SKYLAKE_X, but we treat the Atom case apart because we want to set freq_max to
a higher value, thus the ratio freq_curr/freq_max to be lower, leading to more
conservative frequency selections (favoring power efficiency).
