merging pick_link() with get_link(), part 3

After a pure jump ("/" or procfs-style symlink) we don't need to
hold the link anymore.  link_path_walk() dropped it if such case
had been detected, lookup_last/do_last() (i.e. old trailing_symlink())
left it on the stack - it ended up calling terminate_walk() shortly
anyway, which would've purged the entire stack.

Do it in get_link() itself instead.  Simpler logics that way...
