sched/vtime: Work around an unitialized variable warning

Work around this warning:

  kernel/sched/cputime.c: In function ‘kcpustat_field’:
  kernel/sched/cputime.c:1007:6: warning: ‘val’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

because GCC can't see that val is used only when err is 0.
