mlxsw: acl_flex_actions: Trap all ACL dropped packets to DISCARD_*_ACL traps

Introduce a new set of traps:
DISCARD_INGRESS_ACL and DISCARD_EGRESS_ACL
Set the trap_action from NOP to TRAP which causes the packets dropped
by the TRAP action to be trapped under new trap IDs, depending on the
ingress/egress binding point.
