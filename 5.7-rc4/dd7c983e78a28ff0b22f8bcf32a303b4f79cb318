csky/ftrace: Fixup ftrace_modify_code deadlock without CPU_HAS_ICACHE_INS

If ICACHE_INS is not supported, we use IPI to sync icache on each
core. But ftrace_modify_code is called from stop_machine from default
implementation of arch_ftrace_update_code and stop_machine callback
is irq_disabled. When you call ipi with irq_disabled, a deadlock will
happen.

We couldn't use icache_flush with irq_disabled, but startup make_nop
is specific case and it needn't ipi other cores.
