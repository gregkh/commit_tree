iwlwifi: move integrated, extra_phy and soc_latency to trans_cfg

These values are selected based on the PCI device ID, so the decision
to use them can be made early.  By moving them to the trans_cfg, we
avoid duplicating the large cfg structs for small pieces of
data (sometimes a single boolean).  This will also allow us to make
more decisions based on, for instance, the SoC type in used.

The trans_cfg concept changes a bit, because previously it was used
only to boot the device before reading further characteristics and now
it also contains more data that is associated with the device ID.
