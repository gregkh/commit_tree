drm/ttm, drm/vmwgfx: Support huge TTM pagefaults

Support huge (PMD-size and PUD-size) page-table entries by providing a
huge_fault() callback.
We still support private mappings and write-notify by splitting the huge
page-table entries on write-access.

Note that for huge page-faults to occur, either the kernel needs to be
compiled with trans-huge-pages always enabled, or the kernel needs to be
compiled with trans-huge-pages enabled using madvise, and the user-space
app needs to call madvise() to enable trans-huge pages on a per-mapping
basis.

Furthermore huge page-faults will not succeed unless buffer objects and
user-space addresses are aligned on huge page size boundaries.
