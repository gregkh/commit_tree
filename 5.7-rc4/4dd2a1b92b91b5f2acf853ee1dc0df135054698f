x86: Replace setup_irq() by request_irq()

request_irq() is preferred over setup_irq(). The early boot setup_irq()
invocations happen either via 'init_IRQ()' or 'time_init()', while
memory allocators are ready by 'mm_init()'.

setup_irq() was required in old kernels when allocators were not ready by
the time early interrupts were initialized.

Hence replace setup_irq() by request_irq().

[ tglx: Use a local variable and get rid of the line break. Tweak the
  	comment a bit ]
