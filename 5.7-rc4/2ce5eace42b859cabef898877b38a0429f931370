serial: core: Use string length for SysRq magic sequence

Compiler is not happy about using ARRAY_SIZE() in comparison to smaller type:

  CC      drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.o
.../serial_core.c: In function ‘uart_try_toggle_sysrq’:
.../serial_core.c:3222:24: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Wtype-limits]
 3222 |  if (++port->sysrq_seq < (ARRAY_SIZE(sysrq_toggle_seq) - 1)) {
      |                        ^

Looking at the code it appears that there is an additional weirdness,
i.e. use ARRAY_SIZE() against simple string literal. Yes, the idea probably
was to allow '\0' in the sequence, but it's impractical: kernel configuration
won't accept it to begin with followed by a comment about '\0' before
comparison in question.

Drop all these by switching to strlen() and convert code accordingly.

Note, GCC seems clever enough to calculate string length at compile time.
