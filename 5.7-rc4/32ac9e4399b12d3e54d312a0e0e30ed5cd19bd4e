RDMA/cma: Teach lockdep about the order of rtnl and lock

This lock ordering only happens when bonding is enabled and a certain
bonding related event fires. However, since it can happen this is a global
restriction on lock ordering.

Teach lockdep about the order directly and unconditionally so bugs here
are found quickly.
