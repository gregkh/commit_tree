inet_diag: Move the INET_DIAG_REQ_BYTECODE nlattr to cb->data

The INET_DIAG_REQ_BYTECODE nlattr is currently re-found every time when
the "dump()" is re-started.

In a latter patch, it will also need to parse the new
INET_DIAG_REQ_SK_BPF_STORAGES nlattr to learn the map_fds. Thus, this
patch takes this chance to store the parsed nlattr in cb->data
during the "start" time of a dump.

By doing this, the "bc" argument also becomes unnecessary
and is removed.  Also, the two copies of the INET_DIAG_REQ_BYTECODE
parsing-audit logic between compat/current version can be
consolidated to one.
