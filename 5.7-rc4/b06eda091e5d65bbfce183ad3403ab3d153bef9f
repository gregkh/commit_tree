mm,compaction,cma: add alloc_contig flag to compact_control

Patch series "fix THP migration for CMA allocations", v2.

Transparent huge pages are allocated with __GFP_MOVABLE, and can end up in
CMA memory blocks.  Transparent huge pages also have most of the
infrastructure in place to allow migration.

However, a few pieces were missing, causing THP migration to fail when
attempting to use CMA to allocate 1GB hugepages.

With these patches in place, THP migration from CMA blocks seems to work,
both for anonymous THPs and for tmpfs/shmem THPs.

This patch (of 2):

Add information to struct compact_control to indicate that the allocator
would really like to clear out this specific part of memory, used by for
example CMA.
