clk: ti: Fix dm814x clkctrl for ethernet

We are missing alwon ethernet clock for dm814x and this prevents us
from probing the CPSW with device tree only data. Looks like Ethernet
currently only works if it has been enabled in the bootloader.

Looks like relying on the bootloader clocks is not an issue with the
mainline kernel currently, but it will be an issue when configuring
CPSW Ethernet to probe with device tree data only as we will be managing
the clocks.
