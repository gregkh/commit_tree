mmc: core: Convert to mmc_poll_for_busy() for erase/trim/discard

Rather than open coding the polling loop in mmc_do_erase(), let's convert
to use mmc_poll_for_busy().

To allow a slightly different error parsing during polling, compared to the
__mmc_switch() case, a new in-parameter to mmc_poll_for_busy() is needed,
but other than that the conversion is straight forward.

Besides addressing the open coding issue, moving to mmc_poll_for_busy() for
erase/trim/discard improves the behaviour according to below.

- Adds support for polling via the optional ->card_busy() host ops.
- Returns zero to indicate success when the final polling attempt finds the
  card non-busy, even if the timeout expired.
- Exits the polling loop when state moves to R1_STATE_TRAN, rather than
  when leaving R1_STATE_PRG.
- Decreases the starting range for throttling to 32-64us.
