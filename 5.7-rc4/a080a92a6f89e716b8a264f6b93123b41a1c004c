media: partial revert of "[media] tvp5150: add HW input connectors support"

Commit f7b4b54e6364 ("[media] tvp5150: add HW input connectors support")
added input signals support for the tvp5150, but the approach was found
to be incorrect so the corresponding DT binding commit 82c2ffeb217a
("[media] tvp5150: document input connectors DT bindings") was reverted.

This left the driver with an undocumented (and wrong) DT parsing logic,
so lets get rid of this code as well until the input connectors support
is implemented properly.

It's a partial revert due other patches added on top of mentioned commit
not allowing the commit to be reverted cleanly anymore. But all the code
related to the DT parsing logic and input entities creation are removed.
