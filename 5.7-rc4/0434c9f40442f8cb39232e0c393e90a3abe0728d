ocfs2: roll back the reference count modification of the parent directory if an error occurs

Under some conditions, the directory cannot be deleted.  The specific
scenarios are as follows: (for example, /mnt/ocfs2 is the mount point)

1. Create the /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir directory.  At this time, the i_nlink
   corresponding to the inode of the /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir directory is equal
   to 2.

2. During the process of creating the /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir/s_dir
   directory, if the call to the inc_nlink function in ocfs2_mknod
   succeeds, the functions such as ocfs2_init_acl,
   ocfs2_init_security_set, and ocfs2_dentry_attach_lock fail.  At this
   time, the i_nlink corresponding to the inode of the /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir
   directory is equal to 3, but /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir/s_dir is not added to the
   /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir directory entry.

3. Delete the /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir directory (rm -rf /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir).
   At this time, it is found that the i_nlink corresponding to the inode
   corresponding to the /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir directory is equal to 3.
   Therefore, the /mnt/ocfs2/p_dir directory cannot be deleted.
