net/mlx5e: Don't trigger IRQ multiple times on XSK wakeup to avoid WQ overruns

XSK wakeup function triggers NAPI by posting a NOP WQE to a special XSK
ICOSQ. When the application floods the driver with wakeup requests by
calling sendto() in a certain pattern that ends up in mlx5e_trigger_irq,
the XSK ICOSQ may overflow.

Multiple NOPs are not required and won't accelerate the process, so
avoid posting a second NOP if there is one already on the way. This way
we also avoid increasing the queue size (which might not help anyway).
