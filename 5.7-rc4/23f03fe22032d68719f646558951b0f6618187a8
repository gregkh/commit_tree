docs: hw-vuln: tsx_async_abort.rst: get rid of an unused ref

The virt_mechanism reference there points to a section
called elsewhere (Virtualization mitigation). Also, it is
not used anywere.

Besides that, it conflicts with a label with the same name
inside:

	Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.rst

Perhaps added due to some cut-and-paste?

Anyway, as this is not used, let's just get rid of it.
