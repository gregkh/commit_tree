drm/omap: hdmi4: Rework EDID read to isolate data read

In preparation of adding DRM bridge support to the hdmi4 encoder code,
rework the EDID read to isolate data read.

The hdmi_read_edid() function is the main entry point. It performs all
initialisation steps required prior to reading the EDID (such as
ensuring the device is powered on), as well as corresponding cleanup
steps afterwards. EDID read itself is handled by hdmi_read_edid_data()
that calls the hdmi4_core_ddc_read() function to read individual blocks.

This new code architecture will allow reusing hdmi_read_edid() and
hdmi4_core_ddc_read() for the drm_bridge EDID read implementation, while
swapping out hdmi_read_edid_data() for the DRM drm_do_get_edid()
function.
