net: dsa: add port policers

The approach taken to pass the port policer methods on to drivers is
pragmatic. It is similar to the port mirroring implementation (in that
the DSA core does all of the filter block interaction and only passes
simple operations for the driver to implement) and dissimilar to how
flow-based policers are going to be implemented (where the driver has
full control over the flow_cls_offload data structure).
