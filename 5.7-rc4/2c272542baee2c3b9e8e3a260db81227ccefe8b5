nbd: requeue command if the soecket is changed

In commit 2da22da5734 (nbd: fix zero cmd timeout handling v2),
it is allowed to reset timer when it fires if tag_set.timeout
is set to zero. If the server is shutdown and a new socket
is reconfigured, the request should be requeued to be processed by
new server instead of waiting for response from the old one.
