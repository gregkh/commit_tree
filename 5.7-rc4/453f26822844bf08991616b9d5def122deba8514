iwlwifi: scan: support scan req cmd ver 14

Modify adaptive dwell number of APs override API
Instead of using channel to index mapping, add the adaptive dwell
override parameters as part of the configuration per channel in the scan
request command.

Support 2 different override values and use them as follows:
1. 10 APs for friendly GO channels in p2p scan.
2. 2 APs for social channels in p2p scan.
