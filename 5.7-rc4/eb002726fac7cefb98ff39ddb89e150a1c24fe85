xhci: Ensure link state is U3 after setting USB_SS_PORT_LS_U3

The xHCI spec doesn't specify the upper bound of U3 transition time. For
some devices 20ms is not enough, so we need to make sure the link state
is in U3 before further actions.

I've tried to use U3 Entry Capability by setting U3 Entry Enable in
config register, however the port change event for U3 transition
interrupts the system suspend process.

For now let's use the less ideal method by polling PLS.

[use usleep_range(), and shorten the delay time while polling -Mathias]
