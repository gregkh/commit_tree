sched/isolation: Allow "isolcpus=" to skip unknown sub-parameters

The "isolcpus=" parameter allows sub-parameters before the cpulist is
specified, and if the parser detects an unknown sub-parameters the whole
parameter will be ignored.

This design is incompatible with itself when new sub-parameters are added.
An older kernel will not recognize the new sub-parameter and will
invalidate the whole parameter so the CPU isolation will not take
effect. It emits a warning:

    isolcpus: Error, unknown flag

The better and compatible way is to allow "isolcpus=" to skip unknown
sub-parameters, so that even if new sub-parameters are added an older
kernel will still be able to behave as usual even if with the new
sub-parameter specified on the command line.

Ideally this should have been there when the first sub-parameter for
"isolcpus=" was introduced.
