bnxt_en: Simplify __bnxt_poll_cqs_done().

Simplify the function by removing tha 'all' parameter.  In the current
code, the caller has to specify whether to update/arm both completion
rings with the 'all' parameter.

Instead of this, we can just update/arm all the completion rings
that have been polled.  By setting cpr->had_work_done earlier in
__bnxt_poll_work(), we know which completion ring has been polled
and can just update/arm all the completion rings with
cpr->had_work_done set.

This simplifies the function with one less parameter and works just
as well.
