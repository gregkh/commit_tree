libbpf: Only check mode flags in get_xdp_id

The commit in the Fixes tag changed get_xdp_id to only return prog_id
if flags is 0, but there are other XDP flags than the modes - e.g.,
XDP_FLAGS_UPDATE_IF_NOEXIST. Since the intention was only to look at
MODE flags, clear other ones before checking if flags is 0.
