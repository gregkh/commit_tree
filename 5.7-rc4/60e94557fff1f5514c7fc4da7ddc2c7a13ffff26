drm/i915: Check activity on i915_vma after confirming pin_count==0

Only assert that the i915_vma is now idle if and only if no other pins
are present. If another user has the i915_vma pinned, they may submit
more work to the i915_vma skipping the vm->mutex used to serialise the
unbind. We need to wait again, if we want to continue and unbind this
vma.

However, if we own the i915_vma (we hold the vm->mutex for the unbind
and the pin_count is 0), we can assert that the vma remains idle as we
unbind.
