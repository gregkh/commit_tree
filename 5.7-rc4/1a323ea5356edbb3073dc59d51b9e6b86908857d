x86: get rid of 'errret' argument to __get_user_xyz() macross

Every remaining user just has the error case returning -EFAULT.

In fact, the exception was __get_user_asm_nozero(), which was removed in
commit 4b842e4e25b1 ("x86: get rid of small constant size cases in
raw_copy_{to,from}_user()"), and the other __get_user_xyz() macros just
followed suit for consistency.

Fix up some macro whitespace while at it.
