modpost: return error if module is missing ns imports and MODULE_ALLOW_MISSING_NAMESPACE_IMPORTS=n

Currently when CONFIG_MODULE_ALLOW_MISSING_NAMESPACE_IMPORTS=n, modpost
only warns when a module is missing namespace imports. Under this
configuration, such a module cannot be loaded into the kernel anyway, as
the module loader would reject it. We might as well return a build
error when a module is missing namespace imports under
CONFIG_MODULE_ALLOW_MISSING_NAMESPACE_IMPORTS=n, so that the build
warning does not go ignored/unnoticed.
