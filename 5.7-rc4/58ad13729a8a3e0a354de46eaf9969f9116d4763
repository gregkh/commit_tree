vdpa: make vhost, virtio depend on menu

If user did not configure any vdpa drivers, neither vhost
nor virtio vdpa are going to be useful. So there's no point
in prompting for these and selecting vdpa core automatically.
Simplify configuration by making virtio and vhost vdpa
drivers depend on vdpa menu entry. Once done, we no longer
need a separate menu entry, so also get rid of this.
While at it, fix up the IFC entry: VDPA->vDPA for consistency
with other places.
