KVM: selftests: Rework debug message printing

There were a few problems with the way we output "debug" messages.
The first is that we used DEBUG() which is defined when NDEBUG is
not defined, but NDEBUG will never be defined for kselftests
because it relies too much on assert(). The next is that most
of the DEBUG() messages were actually "info" messages, which
users may want to turn off if they just want a silent test that
either completes or asserts. Finally, a debug message output from
a library function, and thus for all tests, was annoying when its
information wasn't interesting for a test.

Rework these messages so debug messages only output when DEBUG
is defined and info messages output unless QUIET is defined.
Also name the functions pr_debug and pr_info and make sure that
when they're disabled we eat all the inputs. The later avoids
unused variable warnings when the variables were only defined
for the purpose of printing.
