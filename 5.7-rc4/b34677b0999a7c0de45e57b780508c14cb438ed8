clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Implement cpu_pm notifier for context save and restore

omap_dm_timer_enable() restores the entire context(including counter)
based on 2 conditions:
- If get_context_loss_count is populated and context is lost.
- If get_context_loss_count is not populated update unconditionally.

Case2 has a side effect of updating the counter register even though
context is not lost. When timer is configured in pwm mode, this is
causing undesired behaviour in the pwm period.

Instead of using get_context_loss_count call back, implement cpu_pm
notifier with context save and restore support. And delete the
get_context_loss_count callback all together.
