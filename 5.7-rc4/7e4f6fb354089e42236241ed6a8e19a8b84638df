Revert "drm/panel: simple: Add support for Sharp LQ150X1LG11 panels"

This reverts commit 0f9cdd743f7f8d470fff51b11250f02fc554cf1b.

The interface of the panel is LVDS, not parallel.
The color depth is RGB888, not RGB565.
The panel has additional features, making it not so simple.
The only user (upstream) of this panel is appropriately using panel-lvds.
