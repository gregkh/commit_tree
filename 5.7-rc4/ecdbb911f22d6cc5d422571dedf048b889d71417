selftests/resctrl: Add MBM test

MBM (Memory Bandwidth Monitoring) test is the first implemented selftest.
It starts a stressful memory bandwidth benchmark and assigns the
bandwidth pid in a resctrl monitoring group. Read and compare perf IMC
counter and MBM total bytes for the benchmark. The numbers should be
close enough to pass the test.

Default benchmark is built-in fill_buf. But users can specify their
own benchmark by option "-b".

We can add memory bandwidth monitoring for multiple processes in the
future.
