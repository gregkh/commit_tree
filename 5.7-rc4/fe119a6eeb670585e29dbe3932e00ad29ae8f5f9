btrfs: switch to per-transaction pinned extents

This commit flips the switch to start tracking/processing pinned extents
on a per-transaction basis. It mostly replaces all references from
btrfs_fs_info::(pinned_extents|freed_extents[]) to
btrfs_transaction::pinned_extents.

Two notable modifications that warrant explicit mention are changing
clean_pinned_extents to get a reference to the previously running
transaction. The other one is removal of call to
btrfs_destroy_pinned_extent since transactions are going to be cleaned
in btrfs_cleanup_one_transaction.
