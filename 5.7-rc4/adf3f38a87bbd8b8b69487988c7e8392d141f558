docs: kernel-docs: Remove "Here is its" at the end of lines

Before commit 9e03ea7f683e ("Documentation/kernel-docs.txt: convert it
to ReST markup"), it read:

       Description: Linux Journal Kernel Korner article. Here is its
       abstract: "..."

In Sphinx' HTML formatting, however, the "Here is its" doesn't make
sense anymore, because the "Abstract:" is clearly separated.
