KVM: nVMX: remove side effects from nested_vmx_exit_reflected

The name of nested_vmx_exit_reflected suggests that it's purely
a test, but it actually marks VMCS12 pages as dirty.  Move this to
vmx_handle_exit, observing that the initial nested_run_pending check in
nested_vmx_exit_reflected is pointless---nested_run_pending has just
been cleared in vmx_vcpu_run and won't be set until handle_vmlaunch
or handle_vmresume.
