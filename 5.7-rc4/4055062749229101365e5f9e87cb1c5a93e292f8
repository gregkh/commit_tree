mm/hmm: add missing call to hmm_pte_need_fault in HMM_PFN_SPECIAL handling

Currently if a special PTE is encountered hmm_range_fault() immediately
returns EFAULT and sets the HMM_PFN_SPECIAL error output (which nothing
uses).

EFAULT should only be returned after testing with hmm_pte_need_fault().

Also pte_devmap() and pte_special() are exclusive, and there is no need to
check IS_ENABLED, pte_special() is stubbed out to return false on
unsupported architectures.
