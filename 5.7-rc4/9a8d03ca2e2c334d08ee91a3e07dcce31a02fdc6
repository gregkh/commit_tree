ceph: attempt to do async create when possible

With the Octopus release, the MDS will hand out directory create caps.

If we have Fxc caps on the directory, and complete directory information
or a known negative dentry, then we can return without waiting on the
reply, allowing the open() call to return very quickly to userland.

We use the normal ceph_fill_inode() routine to fill in the inode, so we
have to gin up some reply inode information with what we'd expect the
newly-created inode to have. The client assumes that it has a full set
of caps on the new inode, and that the MDS will revoke them when there
is conflicting access.

This functionality is gated on the wsync/nowsync mount options.
