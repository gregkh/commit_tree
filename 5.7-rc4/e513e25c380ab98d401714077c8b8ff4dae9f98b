xfs: remove ATTR_KERNOVAL

We can just pass down the Linux convention of a zero valuelen to just
query for the existance of an attribute to the low-level code instead.
The use in the legacy xfs_attr_list code only used by the ioctl
interface was already dead code, as the callers check that the flag
is not present.
