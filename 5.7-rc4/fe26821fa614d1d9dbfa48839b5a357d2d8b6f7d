net: phy: broadcom: Wire suspend/resume for BCM54810

The BCM54810 PHY can use the standard BMCR Power down suspend, but needs
a custom resume routine which first clear the Power down bit, and then
re-initializes the PHY. While in low-power mode, the PHY only accepts
writes to the BMCR register. The datasheet clearly says it:

Reads or writes to any MII register other than MII Control register
(address 00h) while the device is in the standby power-down mode may
cause unpredictable results.
