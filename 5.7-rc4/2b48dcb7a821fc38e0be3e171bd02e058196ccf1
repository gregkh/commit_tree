clk: sunxi-ng: sun8i-de2: Split out H5 definitions

H5 has less clocks and resets than A64. Currently that's not obvious
because A64 is missing rotation core related clocks and reset.

Split out H5 definition. A64 structures will be fixed in subsequent
commit.

Note that this patch depends on commit 19368d99746e ("clk: sunxi-ng:
add support for Allwinner H3 DE2 CCU") for the H3 clock list.
