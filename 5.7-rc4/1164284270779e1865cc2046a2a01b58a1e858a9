ASoC: meson: axg-card: fix codec-to-codec link setup

Since the addition of commit 9b5db059366a ("ASoC: soc-pcm: dpcm: Only allow
playback/capture if supported"), meson-axg cards which have codec-to-codec
links fail to init and Oops:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000128
  Internal error: Oops: 96000044 [#1] PREEMPT SMP

   ...

While initiliazing the links, ASoC treats the codec-to-codec links of this
card type as a DPCM backend. This error eventually leads to the Oops.

Most of the card driver code is shared between DPCM backends and
codec-to-codec links. The property "no_pcm" marking DCPM BE was left set on
codec-to-codec links, leading to this problem. This commit fixes that.
