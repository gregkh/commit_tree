media: ti-vpe: cal: fix a kernel oops when unloading module

After the switch to use v4l2_async_notifier_add_subdev() and
v4l2_async_notifier_cleanup(), unloading the ti_cal module would cause a
kernel oops.

This was root cause to the fact that v4l2_async_notifier_cleanup() tries
to kfree the asd pointer passed into v4l2_async_notifier_add_subdev().

In our case the asd reference was from a statically allocated struct.
So in effect v4l2_async_notifier_cleanup() was trying to free a pointer
that was not kalloc.

So here we switch to using a kzalloc struct instead of a static one.
To achieve this we re-order some of the calls to prevent asd allocation
from leaking.
