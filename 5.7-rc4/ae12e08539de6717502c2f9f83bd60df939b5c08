lib/vdso: Allow fixed clock mode

Some architectures have a fixed clocksource which is known at compile time
and cannot be replaced or disabled at runtime, e.g. timebase on
PowerPC. For such cases the clock mode check in the VDSO code is pointless.

Move the check for a VDSO capable clocksource into an inline function and
allow architectures to redefine it via a macro.
