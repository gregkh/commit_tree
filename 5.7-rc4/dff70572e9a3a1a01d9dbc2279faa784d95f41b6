soundwire: bus: disable pm_runtime in sdw_slave_delete

Before removing the slave device, disable pm_runtime to prevent any
race condition with the resume being executed after the bus and slave
devices are removed.

Since this pm_runtime_disable() is handled in common routines,
implementations of Slave drivers do not need to call it in their
.remove() routine.
