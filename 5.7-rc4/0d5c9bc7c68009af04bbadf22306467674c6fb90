phy: tegra: Select USB_COMMON for usb_get_maximum_speed()

The usb_get_maximum_speed() function is part of the usb-common module,
so enable it by selecting the corresponding Kconfig symbol.

While at it, also make sure to depend on USB_SUPPORT because USB_PHY
requires that. This can lead to Kconfig conflicts if USB_SUPPORT is not
enabled while attempting to enable PHY_TEGRA_XUSB.
