mlxsw: spectrum_qdisc: Introduce struct mlxsw_sp_qdisc_state

In order to have a tidy structure where to put information related to Qdisc
offloads, introduce a new structure. Move there the two existing pieces of
data: root_qdisc and tclass_qdiscs. Embed them directly, because there's no
reason to go through pointer anymore. Convert users, update init/fini
functions.
