bpftool: Add header guards to generated vmlinux.h

Add canonical #ifndef/#define/#endif guard for generated vmlinux.h header with
__VMLINUX_H__ symbol. __VMLINUX_H__ is also going to play double role of
identifying whether vmlinux.h is being used, versus, say, BCC or non-CO-RE
libbpf modes with dependency on kernel headers. This will make it possible to
write helper macro/functions, agnostic to exact BPF program set up.
