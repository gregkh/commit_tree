KVM: x86: unify callbacks to load paging root

Similar to what kvm-intel.ko is doing, provide a single callback that
merges svm_set_cr3, set_tdp_cr3 and nested_svm_set_tdp_cr3.

This lets us unify the set_cr3 and set_tdp_cr3 entries in kvm_x86_ops.
I'm doing that in this same patch because splitting it adds quite a bit
of churn due to the need for forward declarations.  For the same reason
the assignment to vcpu->arch.mmu->set_cr3 is moved to kvm_init_shadow_mmu
from init_kvm_softmmu and nested_svm_init_mmu_context.
