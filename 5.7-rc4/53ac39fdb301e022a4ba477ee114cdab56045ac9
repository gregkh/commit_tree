xfs: lift cursor copy in/out into xfs_ioc_attr_list

Lift the common code to copy the cursor from and to user space into
xfs_ioc_attr_list.  Note that this means we copy in twice now as
the cursor is in the middle of the conaining structure, but we never
touch the memory for the original copy.  Doing so keeps the cursor
handling isolated in the common helper.
