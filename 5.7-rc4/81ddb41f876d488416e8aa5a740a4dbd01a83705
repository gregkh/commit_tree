RDMA/cm: Allow ib_send_cm_rej() to be done under lock

The first thing ib_send_cm_rej() does is obtain the lock, so use the usual
unlocked wrapper, locked actor pattern here.

This avoids a sketchy lock/unlock sequence (which could allow state to
change) during cm_destroy_id().

While here simplify some of the logic in the implementation.
