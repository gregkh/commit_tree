mptcp: move msk state update to subflow_syn_recv_sock()

After commit 58b09919626b ("mptcp: create msk early"), the
msk socket is already available at subflow_syn_recv_sock()
time. Let's move there the state update, to mirror more
closely the first subflow state.

The above will also help multiple subflow supports.
