efi: Merge EFI system table revision and vendor checks

We have three different versions of the code that checks the EFI system
table revision and copies the firmware vendor string, and they are
mostly equivalent, with the exception of the use of early_memremap_ro
vs. __va() and the lowest major revision to warn about. Let's move this
into common code and factor out the commonalities.
