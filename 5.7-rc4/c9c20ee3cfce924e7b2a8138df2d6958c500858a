Input: goodix - fix compilation when ACPI support is disabled

acpi_evaluate_object() and acpi_execute_simple_method() are not part of
the group of ACPI related functions which get stubbed by
include/linux/acpi.h when ACPI support is disabled, so the
IRQ_PIN_ACCESS_ACPI_METHOD handling code must be stubbed out.

For consistency use the same #if condition as which is used to replace
goodix_add_acpi_gpio_mappings with a stub.
