xprtrdma: Invoke rpcrdma_ia_open in the connect worker

Move rdma_cm_id creation into rpcrdma_ep_create() so that it is now
responsible for allocating all per-connection hardware resources.

With this clean-up, all three arms of the switch statement in
rpcrdma_ep_connect are exactly the same now, thus the switch can be
removed.

Because device removal behaves a little differently than
disconnection, there is a little more work to be done before
rpcrdma_ep_destroy() can release the connection's rdma_cm_id. So
it is not quite symmetrical with rpcrdma_ep_create() yet.
