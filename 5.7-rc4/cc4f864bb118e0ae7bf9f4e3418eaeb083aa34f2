libbpf: Add support for bpf_link-based cgroup attachment

Add bpf_program__attach_cgroup(), which uses BPF_LINK_CREATE subcommand to
create an FD-based kernel bpf_link. Also add low-level bpf_link_create() API.

If expected_attach_type is not specified explicitly with
bpf_program__set_expected_attach_type(), libbpf will try to determine proper
attach type from BPF program's section definition.

Also add support for bpf_link's underlying BPF program replacement:
  - unconditional through high-level bpf_link__update_program() API;
  - cmpxchg-like with specifying expected current BPF program through
    low-level bpf_link_update() API.
