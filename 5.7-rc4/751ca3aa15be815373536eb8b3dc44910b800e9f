regulator: mp886x: add MP8867 support

MP8867 is an I2C-controlled adjustable voltage regulator made by
Monolithic Power Systems. The difference between MP8867 and MP8869
are:
1.If V_BOOT, the vref of MP8869 is fixed at 600mv while vref of
MP8867 is determined by the I2C control.
2.For MP8867, when setting voltage, if the step is within 5, we
need to manually set the GO BIT to 0.
