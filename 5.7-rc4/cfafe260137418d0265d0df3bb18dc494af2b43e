RISC-V: Add supported for ordered booting method using HSM

Currently, all harts have to jump Linux in RISC-V. This complicates the
multi-stage boot process as every transient stage also has to ensure all
harts enter to that stage and jump to Linux afterwards. It also obstructs
a clean Kexec implementation.

SBI HSM extension provides alternate solutions where only a single hart
need to boot and enter Linux. The booting hart can bring up secondary
harts one by one afterwards.

Add SBI HSM based cpu_ops that implements an ordered booting method in
RISC-V. This change is also backward compatible with older firmware not
implementing HSM extension. If a latest kernel is used with older
firmware, it will continue to use the default spinning booting method.
