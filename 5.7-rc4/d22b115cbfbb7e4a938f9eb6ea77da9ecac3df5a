arm64/kernel: Simplify __cpu_up() by bailing out early

The function __cpu_up() is invoked to bring up the target CPU through
the backend, PSCI for example. The nested if statements won't be needed
if we bail out early on the following two conditions where the status
won't be checked. The code looks simplified in that case.

   * Error returned from the backend (e.g. PSCI)
   * The target CPU has been marked as onlined
