net: add helpers to resolve negotiated flow control

Add a couple of helpers to resolve negotiated flow control. Two helpers
are provided:

- linkmode_resolve_pause() which takes the link partner and local
  advertisements, and decodes whether we should enable TX or RX pause
  at the MAC. This is useful outside of phylib, e.g. in phylink.
- phy_get_pause(), which returns the TX/RX enablement status for the
  current negotiation results of the PHY.

This allows us to centralise the flow control resolution, rather than
spreading it around.
