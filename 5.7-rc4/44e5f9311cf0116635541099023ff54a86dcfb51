drm/vmwgfx: Drop preempt_disable() in vmw_fifo_ping_host()

vmw_fifo_ping_host() disables preemption around a test and a register
write via vmw_write(). The write function acquires a spinlock_t typed
lock which is not allowed in a preempt_disable()ed section on
PREEMPT_RT. This has been reported in the bugzilla.

It has been explained by Thomas Hellstrom that this preempt_disable()ed
section is not required for correctness.

Remove the preempt_disable() section.
