tracing: Convert local functions in tracing_map.c to static

Fix the following sparse warning:

kernel/trace/tracing_map.c:286:6: warning: symbol
'tracing_map_array_clear' was not declared. Should it be static?
kernel/trace/tracing_map.c:297:6: warning: symbol
'tracing_map_array_free' was not declared. Should it be static?
kernel/trace/tracing_map.c:319:26: warning: symbol
'tracing_map_array_alloc' was not declared. Should it be static?
