cpuidle: tegra: Squash Tegra114 driver into the common driver

Tegra20/30/114/124 SoCs have common idling states, thus there is no much
point in having separate drivers for a similar hardware. This patch moves
Tegra114/124 arch/ drivers into the common driver without any functional
changes. The CC6 state is kept disabled on Tegra114/124 because the core
Tegra PM code needs some more work in order to support that state.
