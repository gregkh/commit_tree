selftests/bpf: Extend SK_REUSEPORT tests to cover SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH

Parametrize the SK_REUSEPORT tests so that the map type for storing sockets
is not hard-coded in the test setup routine.

This, together with careful state cleaning after the tests, lets us run the
test cases for REUSEPORT_ARRAY, SOCKMAP, and SOCKHASH to have test coverage
for all supported map types. The last two support only TCP sockets at the
moment.
