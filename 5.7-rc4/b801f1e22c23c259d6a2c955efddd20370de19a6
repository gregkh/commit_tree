time/namespace: Fix time_for_children symlink

Looking at the contents of the /proc/PID/ns/time_for_children symlink shows
an anomaly:

$ ls -l /proc/self/ns/* |awk '{print $9, $10, $11}'
...
/proc/self/ns/pid -> pid:[4026531836]
/proc/self/ns/pid_for_children -> pid:[4026531836]
/proc/self/ns/time -> time:[4026531834]
/proc/self/ns/time_for_children -> time_for_children:[4026531834]
/proc/self/ns/user -> user:[4026531837]
...

The reference for 'time_for_children' should be a 'time' namespace, just as
the reference for 'pid_for_children' is a 'pid' namespace.  In other words,
the above time_for_children link should read:

/proc/self/ns/time_for_children -> time:[4026531834]
