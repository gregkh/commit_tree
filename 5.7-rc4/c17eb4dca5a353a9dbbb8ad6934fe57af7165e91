powerpc: Make setjmp/longjmp signature standard

Declaring setjmp()/longjmp() as taking longs makes the signature
non-standard, and makes clang complain. In the past, this has been
worked around by adding -ffreestanding to the compile flags.

The implementation looks like it only ever propagates the value
(in longjmp) or sets it to 1 (in setjmp), and we only call longjmp
with integer parameters.

This allows removing -ffreestanding from the compilation flags.
