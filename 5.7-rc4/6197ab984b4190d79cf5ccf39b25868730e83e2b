mm: improve dump_page() for compound pages

There was no protection against a corrupted struct page having an
implausible compound_head().  Sanity check that a compound page has a head
within reach of the maximum allocatable page (this will need to be
adjusted if one of the plans to allocate 1GB pages comes to fruition).  In
addition,

 - Print the mapping pointer using %p insted of %px.  The actual value of
   the pointer can be read out of the raw page dump and using %p gives a
   chance to correlate it with an earlier printk of the mapping pointer
 - Print the mapping pointer from the head page, not the tail page
   (the tail ->mapping pointer may be in use for other purposes, eg part
   of a list_head)
 - Print the order of the page for compound pages
 - Dump the raw head page as well as the raw page
 - Print the refcount from the head page, not the tail page
