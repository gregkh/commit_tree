xprtrdma: Fix trace point use-after-free race

It's not safe to use resources pointed to by the @send_wr of
ib_post_send() _after_ that function returns. Those resources are
typically freed by the Send completion handler, which can run before
ib_post_send() returns.

Thus the trace points currently around ib_post_send() in the
client's RPC/RDMA transport are a hazard, even when they are
disabled. Rearrange them so that they touch the Work Request only
_before_ ib_post_send() is invoked.
