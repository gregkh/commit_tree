objtool: Optimize find_symbol_by_index()

The symbol index is object wide, not per section, so it makes no sense
to have the symbol_hash be part of the section object. By moving it to
the elf object we avoid the linear sections iteration.

This reduces the runtime of objtool on vmlinux.o from over 3 hours (I
gave up) to a few minutes. The defconfig vmlinux.o has around 20k
sections.
