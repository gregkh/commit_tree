rcuperf: Measure memory footprint during kfree_rcu() test

During changes to kfree_rcu() code, we often check the amount of free
memory.  As an alternative to checking this manually, this commit adds a
measurement in the test itself.  It measures four times during the test
for available memory, digitally filters these measurements to produce a
running average with a weight of 0.5, and compares this digitally filtered
value with the amount of available memory at the beginning of the test.

Something like the following is printed at the end of the run:

Total time taken by all kfree'ers: 6369738407 ns, loops: 10000, batches: 764, memory footprint: 216MB
