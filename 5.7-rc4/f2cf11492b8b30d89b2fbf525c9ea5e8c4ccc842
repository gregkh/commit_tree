io-wq: close cancel gap for hashed linked work

After io_assign_current_work() of a linked work, it can be decided to
offloaded to another thread so doing io_wqe_enqueue(). However, until
next io_assign_current_work() it can be cancelled, that isn't handled.

Don't assign it, if it's not going to be executed.
