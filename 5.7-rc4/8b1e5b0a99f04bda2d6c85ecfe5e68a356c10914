tipc: Add a missing case of TIPC_DIRECT_MSG type

In the commit f73b12812a3d
("tipc: improve throughput between nodes in netns"), we're missing a check
to handle TIPC_DIRECT_MSG type, it's still using old sending mechanism for
this message type. So, throughput improvement is not significant as
expected.

Besides that, when sending a large message with that type, we're also
handle wrong receiving queue, it should be enqueued in socket receiving
instead of multicast messages.

Fix this by adding the missing case for TIPC_DIRECT_MSG.
