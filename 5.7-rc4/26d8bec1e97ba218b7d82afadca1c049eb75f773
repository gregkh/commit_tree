thermal: int340x_thermal: fix: Update Tiger Lake ACPI device IDs

Tiger Lake's new unique ACPI device IDs for Intel thermal driver are not
valid because of missing 'C' in the IDs. Fix the IDs by updating them.

After the update, the new IDs should now look like
INT1040 --> INTC1040
INT1043 --> INTC1043
