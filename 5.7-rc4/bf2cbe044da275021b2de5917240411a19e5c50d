tracing: Use address-of operator on section symbols

Clang warns:

../kernel/trace/trace.c:9335:33: warning: array comparison always
evaluates to true [-Wtautological-compare]
        if (__stop___trace_bprintk_fmt != __start___trace_bprintk_fmt)
                                       ^
1 warning generated.

These are not true arrays, they are linker defined symbols, which are
just addresses. Using the address of operator silences the warning and
does not change the runtime result of the check (tested with some print
statements compiled in with clang + ld.lld and gcc + ld.bfd in QEMU).
