rcu: Add *_ONCE() for grace-period progress indicators

The various RCU structures' ->gp_seq, ->gp_seq_needed, ->gp_req_activity,
and ->gp_activity fields are read locklessly, so they must be updated with
WRITE_ONCE() and, when read locklessly, with READ_ONCE().  This commit makes
these changes.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely.
