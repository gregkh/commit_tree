bpftool: Make probes which emit dmesg warnings optional

Probes related to bpf_probe_write_user and bpf_trace_printk helpers emit
dmesg warnings which might be confusing for people running bpftool on
production environments. This change filters them out by default and
introduces the new positional argument "full" which enables all
available probes.
