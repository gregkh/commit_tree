mac80211: allow setting queue_len for drivers not using wake_tx_queue

Currently a mac80211 driver can only set the txq_limit when using
wake_tx_queue. Not all drivers use wake_tx_queue. This patch adds a new
element to wiphy allowing a driver to set a custom tx_queue_len and the
code that will apply it in case it is set. The current default is
1000 which is too low for ath11k when doing HE rates.
