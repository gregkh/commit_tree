btrfs: fix memory leak of transaction when deleting unused block group

When cleaning pinned extents right before deleting an unused block group,
we check if there's still a previous transaction running and if so we
increment its reference count before using it for cleaning pinned ranges
in its pinned extents iotree. However we ended up never decrementing the
reference count after using the transaction, resulting in a memory leak.

Fix it by decrementing the reference count.
