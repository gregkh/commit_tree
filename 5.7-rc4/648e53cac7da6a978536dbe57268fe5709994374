mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Optimize SFN records processing

Currently, only one SFN query is done from repetitive work at a time,
processing 64 entries. Another work iteration is scheduled in 100ms,
that means that the max rate of learned FDB entries is limited to 6400/s.
That is slow. Fix this by doing 2 optimizations:
1) Run 10 SFN queries at a time.
2) In case the SFN is not drained, schedule work with 0 delay to allow
   to continue processing rest of the records.

On a testing setup with 500K entries the time to process decreased
from 870secs to 10secs.
