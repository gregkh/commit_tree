arm64: dts: renesas: rzg2: Add reset control properties for display

Add reset control properties to the device nodes for the Display Units
on all supported RZ/G2 SoCs.  Note that on these SoCs, there is only a
single reset for each pair of DU channels.

Join the clocks lines while at it, to increase uniformity.
