kbuild: remove AS variable

As commit 5ef872636ca7 ("kbuild: get rid of misleading $(AS) from
documents") noted, we rarely use $(AS) directly in the kernel build.

Now that the only/last user of $(AS) in drivers/net/wan/Makefile was
converted to $(CC), $(AS) is no longer used in the build process.

You can still pass in AS=clang, which is just a switch to turn on
the LLVM integrated assembler.
