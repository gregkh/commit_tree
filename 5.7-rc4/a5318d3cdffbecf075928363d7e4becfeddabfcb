io-uring: drop 'free_pfile' in struct io_file_put

Sync removal of file is only used in case of a GFP_KERNEL kmalloc
failure at the cost of io_file_put::done and work flush, while a
glich like it can be handled at the call site without too much pain.

That said, what is proposed is to drop sync removing of file, and
the kink in neck as well.
