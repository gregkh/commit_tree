ASoC: rt1308-sdw: use slot and rx_mask to configure stream

If the DAI was configured with a set_tdm_slots() call, use the information.

A platform or machine driver may configure each amplifier to extract
different bitSlots from the frame, or extract the same data and use
processing to generate the relevant output. The latter case is easier
to handle in case of orientation changes.
