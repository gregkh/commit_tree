efi: Use more granular check for availability for variable services

The UEFI spec rev 2.8 permits firmware implementations to support only
a subset of EFI runtime services at OS runtime (i.e., after the call to
ExitBootServices()), so let's take this into account in the drivers that
rely specifically on the availability of the EFI variable services.
