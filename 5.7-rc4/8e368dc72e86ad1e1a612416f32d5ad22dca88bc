bpf: Fix use of sk->sk_reuseport from sk_assign

In testing, we found that for request sockets the sk->sk_reuseport field
may yet be uninitialized, which caused bpf_sk_assign() to randomly
succeed or return -ESOCKTNOSUPPORT when handling the forward ACK in a
three-way handshake.

Fix it by only applying the reuseport check for full sockets.
