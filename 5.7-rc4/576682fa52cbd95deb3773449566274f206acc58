block, bfq: make reparent_leaf_entity actually work only on leaf entities

bfq_reparent_leaf_entity() reparents the input leaf entity (a leaf
entity represents just a bfq_queue in an entity tree). Yet, the input
entity is guaranteed to always be a leaf entity only in two-level
entity trees. In this respect, because of the error fixed by
commit 14afc5936197 ("block, bfq: fix overwrite of bfq_group pointer
in bfq_find_set_group()"), all (wrongly collapsed) entity trees happened
to actually have only two levels. After the latter commit, this does not
hold any longer.

This commit fixes this problem by modifying
bfq_reparent_leaf_entity(), so that it searches an active leaf entity
down the path that stems from the input entity. Such a leaf entity is
guaranteed to exist when bfq_reparent_leaf_entity() is invoked.
