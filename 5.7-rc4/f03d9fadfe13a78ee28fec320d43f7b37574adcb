RDMA/core: Add weak ordering dma attr to dma mapping

For memory regions registered with IB_ACCESS_RELAXED_ORDERING will be dma
mapped with the DMA_ATTR_WEAK_ORDERING.

This will allow reads and writes to the mapping to be weakly ordered, such
change can enhance performance on some supporting architectures.
