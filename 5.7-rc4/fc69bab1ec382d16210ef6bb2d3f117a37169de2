regulator: da9063: Fix get_mode() functions to read sleep field

get_mode() is used to retrieve the active mode state. Settings-A
config is used during active state, whilst Settings-B is for
suspend. This means we only need to check the sleep field of each
buck and LDO as that field solely relates to Settings-A config.

This change is a clone of the get_mode() update which was committed
as part of:
