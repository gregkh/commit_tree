PCI: Move Apex Edge TPU class quirk to fix BAR assignment

Some Google Apex Edge TPU devices have a class code of 0
(PCI_CLASS_NOT_DEFINED).  This prevents the PCI core from assigning
resources for the Apex BARs because __dev_sort_resources() ignores
classless devices, host bridges, and IOAPICs.

On x86, firmware typically assigns those resources, so this was not a
problem.  But on some architectures, firmware does *not* assign BARs, and
since the PCI core didn't do it either, the Apex device didn't work
correctly:

  apex 0000:01:00.0: can't enable device: BAR 0 [mem 0x00000000-0x00003fff 64bit pref] not claimed
  apex 0000:01:00.0: error enabling PCI device

f390d08d8b87 ("staging: gasket: apex: fixup undefined PCI class") added a
quirk to fix the class code, but it was in the apex driver, and if the
driver was built as a module, it was too late to help.

Move the quirk to the PCI core, where it will always run early enough that
the PCI core will assign resources if necessary.
