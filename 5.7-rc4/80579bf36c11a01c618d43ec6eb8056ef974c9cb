drm/sun4i: dsi: Avoid hotplug race with DRM driver bind

We need to make sure that the DRM driver is fully registered before
allowing the panel to be attached. Otherwise, we may trigger a hotplug
event before sun4i_framebuffer_init() sets up drm->mode_config.funcs,
causing a NULL pointer dereference.
