nvme-fc: Revert "add module to ops template to allow module references"

The original patch was to resolve the lldd being able to be unloaded
while being used to talk to the boot device of the system. However, the
end result of the original patch is that any driver unload while a nvme
controller is live via the lldd is now being prohibited. Given the module
reference, the module teardown routine can't be called, thus there's no
way, other than manual actions to terminate the controllers.
