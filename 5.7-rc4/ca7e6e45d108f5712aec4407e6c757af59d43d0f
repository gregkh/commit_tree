bpftool: Print the enum's name instead of value

This patch prints the enum's name if there is one found in
the array of btf_enum.

The commit 9eea98497951 ("bpf: fix BTF verification of enums")
has details about an enum could have any power-of-2 size (up to 8 bytes).
This patch also takes this chance to accommodate these non 4 byte
enums.
