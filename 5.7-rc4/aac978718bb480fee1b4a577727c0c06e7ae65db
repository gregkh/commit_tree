drm/i915: Introduce intel_calc_active_pipes()

Extract a small helper to compute the active pipes bitmask
based on the old bitmask + the crtcs in the atomic state.
I want to decouple the cdclk state entirely from the current
global state so I want to track the active pipes also inside
the (to be introduced) full cdclk state.
