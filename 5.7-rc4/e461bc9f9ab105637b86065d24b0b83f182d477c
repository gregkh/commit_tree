scripts/config: allow colons in option strings for sed

Sed broke on some strings as it used colon as a separator.
I made it more robust by using \001, which is legit POSIX AFAIK.

E.g. ./config --set-str CONFIG_USBNET_DEVADDR "de:ad:be:ef:00:01"
failed with: sed: -e expression #1, char 55: unknown option to `s'
