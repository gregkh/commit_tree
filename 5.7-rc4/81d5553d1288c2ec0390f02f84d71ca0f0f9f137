dm clone metadata: Fix return type of dm_clone_nr_of_hydrated_regions()

dm_clone_nr_of_hydrated_regions() returns the number of regions that
have been hydrated so far. In order to do so it employs bitmap_weight().

Until now, the return type of dm_clone_nr_of_hydrated_regions() was
unsigned long.

Because bitmap_weight() returns an int, in case BITS_PER_LONG == 64 and
the return value of bitmap_weight() is 2^31 (the maximum allowed number
of regions for a device), the result is sign extended from 32 bits to 64
bits and an incorrect value is displayed, in the status output of
dm-clone, as the number of hydrated regions.

Fix this by having dm_clone_nr_of_hydrated_regions() return an unsigned
int.
