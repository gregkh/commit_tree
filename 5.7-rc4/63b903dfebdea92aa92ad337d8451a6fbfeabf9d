net: wan: wanxl: use allow to pass CROSS_COMPILE_M68k for rebuilding firmware

As far as I understood from the Kconfig help text, this build rule is
used to rebuild the driver firmware, which runs on an old m68k-based
chip. So, you need m68k tools for the firmware rebuild.

wanxl.c is a PCI driver, but CONFIG_M68K does not select CONFIG_HAVE_PCI.
So, you cannot enable CONFIG_WANXL_BUILD_FIRMWARE for ARCH=m68k. In other
words, ifeq ($(ARCH),m68k) is false here.

I am keeping the dead code for now, but rebuilding the firmware requires
'as68k' and 'ld68k', which I do not have in hand.

Instead, the kernel.org m68k GCC [1] successfully built it.

Allowing a user to pass in CROSS_COMPILE_M68K= is handier.
