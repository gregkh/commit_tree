NFS: Use the 64-bit server readdir cookies when possible

When we're running as a 64-bit architecture and are not running in
32-bit compatibility mode, it is better to use the 64-bit readdir
cookies that supplied by the server. Doing so improves the accuracy
of telldir()/seekdir(), particularly when the directory is changing,
for instance, when doing 'rm -rf'.

We still fall back to using the 32-bit offsets on 32-bit architectures
and when in compatibility mode.
