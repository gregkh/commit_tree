selinux: allow kernfs symlinks to inherit parent directory context

Currently symlinks on kernel filesystems, like sysfs, are labeled on
creation with the parent filesystem root sid.

Allow symlinks to inherit the parent directory context, so fine-grained
kernfs labeling can be applied to symlinks too and checking contexts
doesn't complain about them.

For backward-compatibility this behavior is contained in a new policy
capability: genfs_seclabel_symlinks
