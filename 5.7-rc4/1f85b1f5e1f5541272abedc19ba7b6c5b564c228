genirq: Add return value to check_irq_resend()

In preparation for an interrupt injection interface which can be used
safely by error injection mechanisms. e.g. PCI-E/ AER, add a return value
to check_irq_resend() so errors can be propagated to the caller.

Split out the software resend code so the ugly #ifdef in check_irq_resend()
goes away and the whole thing becomes readable.

Fix up the caller in debugfs. The caller in irq_startup() does not care
about the return value as this is unconditionally invoked for all
interrupts and the resend is best effort anyway.
