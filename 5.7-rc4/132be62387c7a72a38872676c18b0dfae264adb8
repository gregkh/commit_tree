nvme: prevent double free in nvme_alloc_ns() error handling

When jumping to the out_put_disk label, we will call put_disk(), which will
trigger a call to disk_release(), which calls blk_put_queue().

Later in the cleanup code, we do blk_cleanup_queue(), which will also call
blk_put_queue().

Putting the queue twice is incorrect, and will generate a KASAN splat.

Set the disk->queue pointer to NULL, before calling put_disk(), so that the
first call to blk_put_queue() will not free the queue.

The second call to blk_put_queue() uses another pointer to the same queue,
so this call will still free the queue.
