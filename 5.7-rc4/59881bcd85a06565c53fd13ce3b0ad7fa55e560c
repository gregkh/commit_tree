rcu: Add WRITE_ONCE() to rcu_state ->gp_start

The rcu_state structure's ->gp_start field is read locklessly, so this
commit adds the WRITE_ONCE() to an update in order to provide proper
documentation and READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() pairing.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely.
