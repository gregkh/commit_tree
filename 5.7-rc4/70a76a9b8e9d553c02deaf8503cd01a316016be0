drm/i915/gt: Hook up CS_MASTER_ERROR_INTERRUPT

Now that we have offline error capture and can reset an engine from
inside an atomic context while also preserving the GPU state for
post-mortem analysis, it is time to handle error interrupts thrown by
the command parser.

This provides a much, much faster mechanism for us to detect known
problems than using heartbeats/hangchecks, and also provides a mechanism
for when those are disabled. However, it is limited to problems the HW
can detect in the CS and so not a complete solution for detecting lockups.
