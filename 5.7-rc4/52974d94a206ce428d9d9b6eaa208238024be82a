usb: musb: fix crash with highmen PIO and usbmon

When handling a PIO bulk transfer with highmem buffer, a temporary
mapping is assigned to urb->transfer_buffer.  After the transfer is
complete, an invalid address is left behind in this pointer.  This is
not ordinarily a problem since nothing touches that buffer before the
urb is released.  However, when usbmon is active, usbmon_urb_complete()
calls (indirectly) mon_bin_get_data() which does access the transfer
buffer if it is set.  To prevent an invalid memory access here, reset
urb->transfer_buffer to NULL when finished (musb_host_rx()), or do not
set it at all (musb_host_tx()).
