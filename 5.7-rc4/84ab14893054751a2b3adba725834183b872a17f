powerpc/irq: Use current_stack_pointer in check_stack_overflow()

The purpose of check_stack_overflow() is to verify that the stack has
not overflowed.

To really know whether the stack pointer is still within boundaries,
the check must be done directly on the value of r1.

So use current_stack_pointer, which returns the current value of r1,
rather than current_stack_frame() which causes a frame to be created
and then returns that value.
