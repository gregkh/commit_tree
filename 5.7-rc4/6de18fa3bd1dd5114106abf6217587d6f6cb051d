media: Fix build failure due to missing select REGMAP_I2C

While upgrading from 5.5.2 -> 5.5.6 I was surprised by:
ld: drivers/media/i2c/tvp5150.o: in function `tvp5150_probe':
tvp5150.c:(.text+0x11ac): undefined reference to
`__devm_regmap_init_i2c'
make: *** [Makefile:1078: vmlinux] Error 1

The fix was quick enough, make VIDEO_TVP5150 select REGMAP_I2C
And a quick grep showed that it was needed by more targets.
