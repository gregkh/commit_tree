net/smc: do not delete lgr from list twice

When 2 callers call smc_lgr_terminate() at the same time
for the same lgr, one gets the lgr_lock and deletes the lgr from the
list and releases the lock. Then the second caller gets the lock and
tries to delete it again.
In smc_lgr_terminate() add a check if the link group lgr is already
deleted from the link group list and prevent to try to delete it a
second time.
And add a check if the lgr is marked as freeing, which means that a
termination is already pending.
