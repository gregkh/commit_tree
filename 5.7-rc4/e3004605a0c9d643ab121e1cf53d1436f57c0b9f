media: imx: Propagate quantization and encoding in CSI

Unlike the PRPENC and PRPVF subdevices, the CSI's cannot convert
quantization from sink to source, or do any kind of Y'CbCr <-> RGB
encoding. So the CSI's cannot allow quantization and ycbcr_enc to be
selectable by the user and must be propagated from sink to source.

Fixes: 4791bd7d6adc4 ("media: imx: Try colorimetry at both sink and source pads")
