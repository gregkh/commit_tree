drm/amdgpu: limit GDS clearing workaround in cold boot sequence

GDS clear workaround will cause gfx failure in suspend/resume case.

[   98.679559] [drm:amdgpu_device_ip_late_init [amdgpu]] *ERROR* late_init of IP block <gfx_v9_0> failed -110
[   98.679561] PM: dpm_run_callback(): pci_pm_resume+0x0/0xa0 returns -110
[   98.679562] PM: Device 0000:03:00.0 failed to resume async: error -110

As this workaround is specific to the HW bug of GDS's ECC error
existing in cold boot up, so bypass this workaround in suspend/
resume case after booting up.
