drm/i915/gt: Rearrange code to silence compiler

Without selftests enabled, I915_SELFTEST_ONLY becomes a dummy,
generating a bare '0'. This causes the compiler to complain about a
useless line, and while we could use I915_SELFTEST_DECLARE instead, it
is a bit messier. Move the selftest-only code to a helper and make that
conditional on having selftests enabled.
