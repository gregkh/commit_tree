bus: mhi: core: Pass module owner during client driver registration

The module owner field can be used to prevent the removal of kernel
modules when there are any device files associated with it opened in
userspace. Hence, modify the API to pass module owner field. For
convenience, module_mhi_driver() macro is used which takes care of
passing the module owner through THIS_MODULE of the module of the
driver and also avoiding the use of specifying the default MHI client
driver register/unregister routines.
