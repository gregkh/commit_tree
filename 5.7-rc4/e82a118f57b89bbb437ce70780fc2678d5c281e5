clone3: fix cgroup argument sanity check

Checking that cgroup field value of struct clone_args is less than 0
is useless, as it is defined as unsigned 64-bit integer.  Moreover,
it doesn't catch the situations where its higher bits are lost during
the assignment to the cgroup field of the cgroup field of the internal
struct kernel_clone_args (where it is declared as signed 32-bit
integer), so it is still possible to pass garbage there.  A check
against INT_MAX solves both these issues.
