vm86: get rid of get_user_ex() use

Just do a copyin of what we want into a local variable and
be done with that.  We are guaranteed to be on shallow stack
here...

Note that conditional expression for range passed to access_ok()
in mainline had been pointless all along - the only difference
between vm86plus_struct and vm86_struct is that the former has
one extra field in the end and when we get to copyin of that
field (conditional upon 'plus' argument), we use copy_from_user().
Moreover, all fields starting with ->int_revectored are copied
that way, so we only need that check (be it done by access_ok()
or by user_access_begin()) only on the beginning of the structure -
the fields that used to be covered by that get_user_try() block.
