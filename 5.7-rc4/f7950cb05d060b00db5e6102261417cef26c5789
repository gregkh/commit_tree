cifs: smbd: Calculate the correct maximum packet size for segmented SMBDirect send/receive

The packet size needs to take account of SMB2 header size and possible
encryption header size. This is only done when signing is used and it is for
RDMA send/receive, not read/write.

Also remove the dead SMBD code in smb2_negotiate_r(w)size.
