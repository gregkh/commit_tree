timer: Improve the comment describing schedule_timeout()

When working commit 6dcd5d7a7a29c1e, a mistake was noticed by Linus:
schedule_timeout() was called without setting the task state to anything
particular.

It calls the scheduler, but doesn't delay anything, because the task stays
runnable. That happens because sched_submit_work() does nothing for tasks
in TASK_RUNNING state.

That turned out to be the intended behavior. Adding a WARN() is not useful
as the task could be woken up right after setting the state and before
reaching schedule_timeout().

Improve the comment about schedule_timeout() and describe that more
explicitly.
