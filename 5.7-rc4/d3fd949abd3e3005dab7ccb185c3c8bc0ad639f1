Fix memfd to support relocatable build (O=objdir). This calls out
source files necessary to build tests and simplfies the dependency
enforcement.

Tested the following:

make all
make clean
make kselftest-install O=/arm64_build/ ARCH=arm64 HOSTCC=gcc \
CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- TARGETS=memfd
