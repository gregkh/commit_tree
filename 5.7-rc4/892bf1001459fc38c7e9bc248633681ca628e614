mmc: core: Fixup support for HW busy detection for HPI commands

In case the host specify a max_busy_timeout, we need to validate that the
needed timeout for the HPI command conforms to that requirement. If that's
not the case, let's convert from a R1B response to a R1 response, as to
instruct the host to avoid HW busy detection.

Additionally, when R1B is used we must also inform the host about the busy
timeout for the command, so let's do that via updating cmd.busy_timeout.

Finally, when R1B is used and in case the host supports HW busy detection,
there should be no need for doing polling, so then skip that.
