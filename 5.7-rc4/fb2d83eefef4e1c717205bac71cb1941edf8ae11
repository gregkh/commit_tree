btrfs: unset reloc control if we fail to recover

If we fail to load an fs root, or fail to start a transaction we can
bail without unsetting the reloc control, which leads to problems later
when we free the reloc control but still have it attached to the file
system.

In the normal path we'll end up calling unset_reloc_control() twice, but
all it does is set fs_info->reloc_control = NULL, and we can only have
one balance at a time so it's not racey.
