arm: dts: calxeda: Fix interrupt grouping

Currently multiple interrupts for some devices are written as one array
instead of using the DT grouping notation (<0 42 4>, <0 23 4>).
This ends up in the same binary representation in the .dtb, but is
semantically not equivalent. The yaml schema checks will stumble over
this, so lets fix that first.

I refrained from using the symbolic names for GIC_SPI/GIC_PPI and
IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, mostly because it increases the delta between the
original DTS files and the mainline versions, so it's just additional
churn.
