net: marvell10g: soft-reset the PHY when coming out of low power

Soft-reset the PHY when coming out of low power mode, which seems to
be necessary with firmware versions 0.3.3.0 and 0.3.10.0.

This depends on ("net: marvell10g: report firmware version")

Fixes: c9cc1c815d36 ("net: phy: marvell10g: place in powersave mode at probe")
