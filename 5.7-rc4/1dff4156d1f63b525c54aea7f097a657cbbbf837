lib/vdso: Allow the high resolution parts to be compiled out

If the architecture knows at compile time that there is no VDSO capable
clocksource supported it makes sense to optimize the guts of the high
resolution parts of the VDSO out at build time. Add a helper function to
check whether the VDSO should be high resolution capable and provide a stub
which can be overridden by an architecture.
