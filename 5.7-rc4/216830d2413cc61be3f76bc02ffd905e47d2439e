of: unittest: kmemleak in of_unittest_platform_populate()

kmemleak reports several memory leaks from devicetree unittest.
This is the fix for problem 2 of 5.

of_unittest_platform_populate() left an elevated reference count for
grandchild nodes (which are platform devices).  Fix the platform
device reference counts so that the memory will be freed.
