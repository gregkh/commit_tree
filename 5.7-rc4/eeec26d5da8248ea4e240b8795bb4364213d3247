time/namespace: Add max_time_namespaces ucount

Michael noticed that userns limit for number of time namespaces is missing.

Furthermore, time namespace introduced UCOUNT_TIME_NAMESPACES, but didn't
introduce an array member in user_table[]. It would make array's
initialisation OOB write, but by luck the user_table array has an excessive
empty member (all accesses to the array are limited with UCOUNT_COUNTS - so
it silently reuses the last free member.

Fixes user-visible regression: max_inotify_instances by reason of the
missing UCOUNT_ENTRY() has limited max number of namespaces instead of the
number of inotify instances.

Fixes: 769071ac9f20 ("ns: Introduce Time Namespace")
