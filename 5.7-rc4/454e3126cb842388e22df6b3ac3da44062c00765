kernel/kcmp.c: Use new infrastructure to fix deadlocks in execve

This changes kcmp_epoll_target to use the new exec_update_mutex
instead of cred_guard_mutex.

This should be safe, as the credentials are only used for reading,
and furthermore ->mm and ->sighand are updated on execve,
but only under the new exec_update_mutex.
