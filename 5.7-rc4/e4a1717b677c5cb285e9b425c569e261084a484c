ethtool: provide ring sizes with RINGS_GET request

Implement RINGS_GET request to get ring sizes of a network device. These
are traditionally available via ETHTOOL_GRINGPARAM ioctl request.

Omit attributes for ring types which are not supported by driver or device
(zero reported for maximum).

v2: (all suggested by Jakub Kicinski)
  - minor cleanup in rings_prepare_data()
  - more descriptive rings_reply_size()
  - omit attributes with zero max size
