xprtrdma: Merge struct rpcrdma_ia into struct rpcrdma_ep

I eventually want to allocate rpcrdma_ep separately from struct
rpcrdma_xprt so that on occasion there can be more than one ep per
xprt.

The new struct rpcrdma_ep will contain all the fields currently in
rpcrdma_ia and in rpcrdma_ep. This is all the device and CM settings
for the connection, in addition to per-connection settings
negotiated with the remote.

Take this opportunity to rename the existing ep fields from rep_* to
re_* to disambiguate these from struct rpcrdma_rep.
