cgroup: unify attach permission checking

The core codepaths to check whether a process can be attached to a
cgroup are the same for threads and thread-group leaders. Only a small
piece of code verifying that source and destination cgroup are in the
same domain differentiates the thread permission checking from
thread-group leader permission checking.
Since cgroup_migrate_vet_dst() only matters cgroup2 - it is a noop on
cgroup1 - we can move it out of cgroup_attach_task().
All checks can now be consolidated into a new helper
cgroup_attach_permissions() callable from both cgroup_procs_write() and
cgroup_threads_write().
