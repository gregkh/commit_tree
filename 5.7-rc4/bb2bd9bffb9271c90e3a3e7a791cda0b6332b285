arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Add missing clocks / fix names on the gpucc

We're transitioning over to requiring the Qualcomm GPU Clock
Controller to specify all the input clocks.  Let's add them for
sdm845.

As part of this we've decided that the xo clock should be referred to
in the bindings as "bi_tcxo".  Change the dts.

NOTE: Until the Linux driver for sdm845's gpucc is updated, these
clocks will not actually be used in Linux.  It will continue to use
global clock names to match things up.  Of course, Linux didn't use
the old "xo" clock anyway.
