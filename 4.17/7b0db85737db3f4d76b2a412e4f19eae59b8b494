ipmr, ip6mr: Unite dumproute flows

The various MFC entries are being held in the same kind of mr_tables
for both ipmr and ip6mr, and their traversal logic is identical.
Also, with the exception of the addresses [and other small tidbits]
the major bulk of the nla setting is identical.

Unite as much of the dumping as possible between the two.
Notice this requires creating an mr_table iterator for each, as the
for-each preprocessor macro can't be used by the common logic.
