x86/hyper-v: move hyperv.h out of uapi

hyperv.h is not part of uapi, there are no (known) users outside of kernel.
We are making changes to this file to match current Hyper-V Hypervisor
Top-Level Functional Specification (TLFS, see:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/tlfs)
and we don't want to maintain backwards compatibility.

Move the file renaming to hyperv-tlfs.h to avoid confusing it with
mshyperv.h. In future, all definitions from TLFS should go to it and
all kernel objects should go to mshyperv.h or include/linux/hyperv.h.
