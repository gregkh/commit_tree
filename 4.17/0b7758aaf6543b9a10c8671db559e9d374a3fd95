powerpc/trace/syscalls: Update syscall name matching logic

On powerpc64 ABIv1, we are enabling syscall tracing for only ~20
syscalls. This is due to commit e145242ea0df6 ("syscalls/core,
syscalls/x86: Clean up syscall stub naming convention") which has
changed the syscall entry wrapper prefix from "SyS" to "__se_sys".

Update the logic for ABIv1 to not just skip the initial dot, but also
the "__se_sys" prefix.

Fixes: commit e145242ea0df6 ("syscalls/core, syscalls/x86: Clean up syscall stub naming convention")
