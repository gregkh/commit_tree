powerpc/mce: Fix a bug where mce loops on memory UE.

The current code extracts the physical address for UE errors and then
hooks it up into memory failure infrastructure. On successful
extraction of physical address it wrongly sets "handled = 1" which
means this UE error has been recovered. Since MCE handler gets return
value as handled = 1, it assumes that error has been recovered and
goes back to same NIP. This causes MCE interrupt again and again in a
loop leading to hard lockup.

Also, initialize phys_addr to ULONG_MAX so that we don't end up
queuing undesired page to hwpoison.

Without this patch we see:
