rcu: Remove obsolete __rcu_pending() statistics for debugfs

The debugfs interface displayed statistics on RCU-pending checks
but this interface has since been removed.  This commit therefore
removes the no-longer-used rcu_data structure's ->n_rcu_pending,
->n_rp_core_needs_qs, ->n_rp_report_qs, ->n_rp_cb_ready,
->n_rp_cpu_needs_gp, ->n_rp_gp_completed, ->n_rp_gp_started,
->n_rp_nocb_defer_wakeup, and ->n_rp_need_nothing fields along with
their updates.

If this information proves necessary in the future, the corresponding
event traces will be added.
