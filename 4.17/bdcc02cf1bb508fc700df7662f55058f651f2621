drm/psr: Fix missed entry in PSR setup time table.

Entry corresponding to 220 us setup time was missing. I am not aware of
any specific bug this fixes, but this could potentially result in enabling
PSR on a panel with a higher setup time requirement than supported by the
hardware.

I verified the value is present in eDP spec versions 1.3, 1.4 and 1.4a.
