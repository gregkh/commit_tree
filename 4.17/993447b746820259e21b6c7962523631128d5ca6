mtd: rawnand: handle differently chip/controller errors about timings

Usually, the source of the error when setting/getting features does not
matter (if the controller does not support sending the command or if
the chip does not support the operation).

When it comes to timings, if the controller fails it is an error while
if the chip does not support the operation, it can be silently supposed
that it already works with the maximum supported timings.

Introduce some logic in nand_setup_data_interface() to handle that
difference.
