ocfs2: move some definitions to header file

Patch series "ocfs2: use kobject for online file check", v3.

Use embedded kobject mechanism for online file check feature, this will
avoid to use a global list to save/search per-device online file check
related data.  The changed code is based on Goldwyn Rodrigues's patches
and ext4 fs code, there is not any new features added, except some very
small fixes during this code refactoring.  Second, the code change does
not affect the underlying file check code.  Thank Goldwyn very much.

Compare with second version, add more comments in the patch
descriptions, to make sure each modification is mentioned.  Compare with
first version, split the code change into four patches, make sure each
patch will not bring ocfs2 kernel modules compiling errors.

This patch (of 3):

Move some definitions to header file, which will be referenced by other
source files when kobject mechanism is introduced.
