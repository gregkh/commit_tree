media: v4l2-common: fix a compilation breakage

Clearly, changeset 95ce9c28601a ("media: v4l: common: Add a
function to obtain best size from a list") was never tested, as it
broke compilation with:

Basically, v4l2_find_nearest_size() callers pass 5 arguments,
while its definition require 6 args.

Unfortunately, my build process was also broken, as it was reporting me that
the compilation went fine:

	$ make ARCH=i386  CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y C=1 W=1 CHECK='compile_checks' M=drivers/staging/media
	$ make ARCH=i386  CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y C=1 W=1 CHECK='compile_checks' M=drivers/media

	*** ERRORS ***

	*** WARNINGS ***
	compilation succeeded

That was due to a change here to use of linux-log-diff script that
provides a diffstat between the errors output. Somehow, the logic
was missing some fatal errors.
