drm/i915/gen9, gen10: Disable FBC on planes with a misaligned Y-offset

Enabling FBC on a plane having a Y-offset that isn't divisible by 4 may
cause pipe FIFO underruns and flickers, so disable FBC on such a config.

I tried the followings to work around the issue:
- enable each HW work around in ILK_DPFC_CHICKEN
- disable each compression algorithm in ILK_DPFC_CONTROL
- disable low-power watermarks
None of the above got rid of the problem. I haven't found this issue in
the Bspec/WA database either.

Besides the igt testcase below (yet to be merged) an easy way to
reproduce the issue is to enable a plane with FBC and a plane Y-offset
not aligned to 4 and then just enable/disable FBC in a loop, keeping the
plane enabled.

I could trigger the problem on BXT/GLK/SKL/CNL, so assume for now that it's
only present on GEN9 and GEN10.

v2: (Ville)
- Run the test/apply the WA on CNL as well.
- Use IS_GEN() instead of INTEL_GEN().
- Fix spelling.
