batman-adv: Fix TT sync flags for intermediate TT responses

The previous TT sync fix so far only fixed TT responses issued by the
target node directly. So far, TT responses issued by intermediate nodes
still lead to the wrong flags being added, leading to CRC mismatches.

This behaviour was observed at Freifunk Hannover in a 800 nodes setup
where a considerable amount of nodes were still infected with 'WI'
TT flags even with (most) nodes having the previous TT sync fix applied.

I was able to reproduce the issue with intermediate TT responses in a
four node test setup and this patch fixes this issue by ensuring to
use the per originator instead of the summarized, OR'd ones.
