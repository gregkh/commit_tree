ACPI / scan: Initialize watchdog before PNP

At least on one Dell system the PNP motherboard resources device
includes resources used by WDAT table. Since PNP gets initialized before
WDAT it results following error and no watchdog:

  platform wdat_wdt: failed to claim resource 3: [io  0x046a-0x046c]
  ACPI: watchdog: Device creation failed: -16

Now, the PNP system driver is already accustomed with the situation that
it cannot reserve all those motherboard resources because drivers using
those might have reserved them already. In addition putting WDAT table
resources under motherboard resources device makes sense in general.

Fix this by initializing WDAT right before PNP. This allows WDAT to
reserve all its resources and still keeps PNP system driver happy.
