fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c: fix typo in sysctl_check_table_array()

Patch series "ipc: Clamp *mni to the real IPCMNI limit", v3.

The sysctl parameters msgmni, shmmni and semmni have an inherent limit
of IPC_MNI (32k).  However, users may not be aware of that because they
can write a value much higher than that without getting any error or
notification.  Reading the parameters back will show the newly written
values which are not real.

Enforcing the limit by failing sysctl parameter write, however, can
break existing user applications.  To address this delemma, a new flags
field is introduced into the ctl_table.  The value CTL_FLAGS_CLAMP_RANGE
can be added to any ctl_table entries to enable a looser range clamping
without returning any error.  For example,

  .flags = CTL_FLAGS_CLAMP_RANGE,

This flags value are now used for the range checking of shmmni, msgmni
and semmni without breaking existing applications.  If any out of range
value is written to those sysctl parameters, the following warning will
be printed instead.

  Kernel parameter "shmmni" was set out of range [0, 32768], clamped to 32768.

Reading the values back will show 32768 instead of some fake values.

This patch (of 6):

Fix a typo.
