kernel: open-code sys_rt_sigpending() in sys_sigpending()

A similar but not fully equivalent code path is already open-coded
three times (in sys_rt_sigpending and in the two compat stubs), so
do it a fourth time here.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
