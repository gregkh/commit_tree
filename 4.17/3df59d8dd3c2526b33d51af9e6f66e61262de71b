KVM: arm/arm64: Get rid of vcpu->arch.irq_lines

We currently have a separate read-modify-write of the HCR_EL2 on entry
to the guest for the sole purpose of setting the VF and VI bits, if set.
Since this is most rarely the case (only when using userspace IRQ chip
and interrupts are in flight), let's get rid of this operation and
instead modify the bits in the vcpu->arch.hcr[_el2] directly when
needed.
