serial: imx: simplify tracking of dma being initialized

The .dma_is_inited member is only set to a value != 0 when the port's
startup function calls imx_uart_dma_init(). On shutdown of the port
imx_uart_dma_exit is called which sets the value back to 0. So
.dma_is_inited is always 0 when imx_startup() is called (assuming
.startup() and .shutdown() are correctly balanced) and the check for
!sport->dma_is_inited can go away.

This allows to replace .dma_is_inited by a variable local to
imx_startup.
