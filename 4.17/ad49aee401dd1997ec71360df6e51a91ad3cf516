extcon: intel-cht-wc: Set direction and drv flags for V5 boost GPIO

Sometimes (firmware bug?) the V5 boost GPIO is not configured as output
by the BIOS, leading to the 5V boost convertor being permanently on,

Explicitly set the direction and drv flags rather then inheriting them
from the firmware to fix this.
