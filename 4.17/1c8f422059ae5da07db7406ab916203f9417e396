mm: change return type to vm_fault_t

The plan for these patches is to introduce the typedef, initially just
as documentation ("These functions should return a VM_FAULT_ status").
We'll trickle the patches to individual drivers/filesystems in through
the maintainers, as far as possible.  Then we'll change the typedef to
an unsigned int and break the compilation of any unconverted
drivers/filesystems.

vmf_insert_page(), vmf_insert_mixed() and vmf_insert_pfn() are three
newly added functions.  The various drivers/filesystems where return
value of fault(), huge_fault(), page_mkwrite() and pfn_mkwrite() get
converted, will need them.  These functions will return correct
VM_FAULT_ code based on err value.

We've had bugs before where drivers returned -EFOO.  And we have this
silly inefficiency where vm_insert_xxx() return an errno which (afaict)
every driver then converts into a VM_FAULT code.  In many cases drivers
failed to return correct VM_FAULT code value despite of vm_insert_xxx()
fails.  We have indentified and clean up all those existing bugs and
silly inefficiencies in driver/filesystems by adding these three new
inline wrappers.  As mentioned above, we will trickle those patches to
individual drivers/filesystems in through maintainers after these three
wrapper functions are merged.

Eventually we can convert vm_insert_xxx() into vmf_insert_xxx() and
remove these inline wrappers, but these are a good intermediate step.
