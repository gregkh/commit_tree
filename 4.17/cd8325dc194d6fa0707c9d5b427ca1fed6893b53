arm64: dts: renesas: r8a7795: update register size for thermal

To be able to read fused calibration values from hardware the size of
the register resource of TSC1 needs to be incremented to cover one more
register which holds the information if the calibration values have been
fused or not.

Instead of increasing TSC1 size to the value from the datasheet update
all TSC's size to the smallest granularity of the address decoder
circuitry
