lib/test_bitmap.c: do not accidentally use stack VLA

This avoids an accidental stack VLA (since the compiler thinks the value
of "len" can change, even when marked "const").  This just replaces it
with a #define so it will DTRT.

Seen with -Wvla.  Fixed as part of the directive to remove all VLAs from
the kernel: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/7/621
