mlxsw: spectrum_kvdl: avoid uninitialized variable warning

gcc warns that 'resource_id' is not initialized if we don't come though
any of the three 'case' statements before:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_kvdl.c: In function 'mlxsw_sp_kvdl_part_init':
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_kvdl.c:275:8: error: 'resource_id' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

In the current code, that won't happen, but it's more robust to explicitly
handle this by returning a failure from mlxsw_sp_kvdl_part_init.
