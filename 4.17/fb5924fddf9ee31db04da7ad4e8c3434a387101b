powerpc/mm: Flush cache on memory hot(un)plug

This patch adds support for flushing potentially dirty cache lines
when memory is hot-plugged/hot-un-plugged. The support is currently
limited to 64 bit systems.

The bug was exposed when mappings for a device were actually
hot-unplugged and plugged in back later. A similar issue was observed
during the development of memtrace, but memtrace does it's own
flushing of region via a custom routine.

These patches do a flush both on hotplug/unplug to clear any stale
data in the cache w.r.t mappings, there is a small race window where a
clean cache line may be created again just prior to tearing down the
mapping.

The patches were tested by disabling the flush routines in memtrace
and doing I/O on the trace file. The system immediately
checkstops (quite reliablly if prior to the hot-unplug of the memtrace
region, we memset the regions we are about to hot unplug). After these
patches no custom flushing is needed in the memtrace code.
