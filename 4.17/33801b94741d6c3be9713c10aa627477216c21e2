perf/core: Fix installing cgroup events on CPU

There's two problems when installing cgroup events on CPUs: firstly
list_update_cgroup_event() only tries to set cpuctx->cgrp for the
first event, if that mismatches on @cgrp we'll not try again for later
additions.

Secondly, when we install a cgroup event into an active context, only
issue an event reprogram when the event matches the current cgroup
context. This avoids a pointless event reprogramming.
