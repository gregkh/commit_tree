drm/i915/breadcrumbs: Ignore unsubmitted signalers

When a request is preempted, it is unsubmitted from the HW queue and
removed from the active list of breadcrumbs. In the process, this
however triggers the signaler and it may see the clear rbtree with the
old, and still valid, seqno, or it may match the cleared seqno with the
now zero rq->global_seqno. This confuses the signaler into action and
signaling the fence.
