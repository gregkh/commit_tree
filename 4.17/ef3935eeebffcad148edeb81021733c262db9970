arm64: insn: Add encoder for bitwise operations using literals

We lack a way to encode operations such as AND, ORR, EOR that take
an immediate value. Doing so is quite involved, and is all about
reverse engineering the decoding algorithm described in the
pseudocode function DecodeBitMasks().

This has been tested by feeding it all the possible literal values
and comparing the output with that of GAS.
