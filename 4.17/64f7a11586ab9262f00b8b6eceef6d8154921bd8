KVM: vmx: update sec exec controls for UMIP iff emulating UMIP

Update SECONDARY_EXEC_DESC for UMIP emulation if and only UMIP
is actually being emulated.  Skipping the VMCS update eliminates
unnecessary VMREAD/VMWRITE when UMIP is supported in hardware,
and on platforms that don't have SECONDARY_VM_EXEC_CONTROL.  The
latter case resolves a bug where KVM would fill the kernel log
with warnings due to failed VMWRITEs on older platforms.
