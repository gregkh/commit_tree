tools/hv: Fix IP reporting by KVP daemon with SRIOV

On Hyper-V the VF NIC has the same MAC as the related synthetic NIC.
VF NIC can work under the synthetic NIC transparently, without its
own IP address. The existing KVP daemon only gets IP from the first
NIC matching a MAC address, and may not be able to find the IP in
this case.

This patch fixes the problem by searching the NIC matching the MAC,
and having an IP address. So, the IP address will be found and
reported to the host successfully.
