ip_tunnel: restore binding to ifaces with a large mtu

After commit f6cc9c054e77, the following conf is broken (note that the
default loopback mtu is 65536, ie IP_MAX_MTU + 1):

$ ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre local 10.125.0.1 remote 10.125.0.2 dev lo
add tunnel "gre0" failed: Invalid argument
$ ip l a type dummy
$ ip l s dummy1 up
$ ip l s dummy1 mtu 65535
$ ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre local 10.125.0.1 remote 10.125.0.2 dev dummy1
add tunnel "gre0" failed: Invalid argument

dev_set_mtu() doesn't allow to set a mtu which is too large.
First, let's cap the mtu returned by ip_tunnel_bind_dev(). Second, remove
the magic value 0xFFF8 and use IP_MAX_MTU instead.
0xFFF8 seems to be there for ages, I don't know why this value was used.

With a recent kernel, it's also possible to set a mtu > IP_MAX_MTU:
$ ip l s dummy1 mtu 66000
After that patch, it's also possible to bind an ip tunnel on that kind of
interface.
