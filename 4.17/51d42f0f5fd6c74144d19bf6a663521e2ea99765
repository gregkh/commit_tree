powerpc: Keep const vars out of writable .sdata

Newer gcc will support "-mno-readonly-in-sdata"[1], which makes sure that
the optimization on PPC32 for variables getting moved into the .sdata
section will not apply to const variables (which must be in .rodata).

This was originally noticed in mm/rodata_test.c when rodata_test_data
was not static:

c0695034 g     O .data	00000004 rodata_test_data

After this patch with an updated compiler, this is correctly in .rodata.
