xen/pvh: Indicate XENFEAT_linux_rsdp_unrestricted to Xen

Pre-4.17 kernels ignored start_info's rsdp_paddr pointer and instead
relied on finding RSDP in standard location in BIOS RO memory. This
has worked since that's where Xen used to place it.

However, with recent Xen change (commit 4a5733771e6f ("libxl: put RSDP
for PVH guest near 4GB")) it prefers to keep RSDP at a "non-standard"
address. Even though as of commit b17d9d1df3c3 ("x86/xen: Add pvh
specific rsdp address retrieval function") Linux is able to find RSDP,
for back-compatibility reasons we need to indicate to Xen that we can
handle this, an we do so by setting XENFEAT_linux_rsdp_unrestricted
flag in ELF notes.

(Also take this opportunity and sync features.h header file with Xen)
