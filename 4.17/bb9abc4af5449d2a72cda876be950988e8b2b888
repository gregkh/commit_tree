scsi: hisi_sas: increase timer expire of internal abort task

The current 110ms expiry time is not long enough for the internal abort
task.

The reason is that the internal abort task could be blocked in HW if the HW
is retrying to set up link. The internal abort task will be executed only
when the retry process finished.

The maximum time is 5s for the retry of setting up link. So, the timer
expire should be more than 5s. This patch increases it from 110ms to 6s.
