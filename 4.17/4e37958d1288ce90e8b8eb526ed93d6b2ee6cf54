init, tracing: Have printk come through the trace events for initcall_debug

With trace events set before and after the initcall function calls, instead
of having a separate routine for printing out the initcalls when
initcall_debug is specified on the kernel command line, have the code
register a callback to the tracepoints where the initcall trace events are.

This removes the need for having a separate function to do the initcalls as
the tracepoint callbacks can handle the printk. It also includes other
initcalls that are not called by the do_one_initcall() which includes
console and security initcalls.
