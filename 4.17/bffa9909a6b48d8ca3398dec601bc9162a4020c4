blk-mq: don't keep offline CPUs mapped to hctx 0

From commit 4b855ad37194 ("blk-mq: Create hctx for each present CPU),
blk-mq doesn't remap queue after CPU topo is changed, that said when
some of these offline CPUs become online, they are still mapped to
hctx 0, then hctx 0 may become the bottleneck of IO dispatch and
completion.

This patch sets up the mapping from the beginning, and aligns to
queue mapping for PCI device (blk_mq_pci_map_queues()).
