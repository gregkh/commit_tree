i40e: move AUTO_DISABLED flags into the state field

The two Flow Directory auto disable flags are used at run time to mark
when the flow director features needed to be disabled. Thus the flags
could change even when the RTNL lock is not held.

They also have some code constructions which really should be
test_and_set or test_and_clear using atomic bit operations.

Create new state fields to mark this, and stop including them in
pf->flags.

This is part of a larger effort to remove the need for cmpxchg64 in
i40e_set_priv_flags().
