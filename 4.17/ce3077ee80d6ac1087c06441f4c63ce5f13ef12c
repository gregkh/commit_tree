direct-io: Remove unused DIO_SKIP_DIO_COUNT logic

This flag was added by fe0f07d08ee3 ("direct-io: only inc/deci
inode->i_dio_count for file systems") as means to optimise the atomic
modificaiton of the variable for blockdevices. However with the advent
of 542ff7bf18c6 ("block: new direct I/O implementation") it became
unused. So let's remove it.
