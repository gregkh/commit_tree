selftests: pmtu: Add test_pmtu_vti4_exception test

This test checks that PMTU exceptions are created only when
needed on IPv4 routes with vti and xfrm, and their PMTU value is
checked as well.

We can't adopt the same approach as test_pmtu_vti6_exception()
here, because on IPv4 administrative MTU changes won't be
reflected directly on PMTU.
