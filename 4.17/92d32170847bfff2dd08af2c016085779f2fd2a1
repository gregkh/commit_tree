btrfs: fix unaligned access in readdir

The last update to readdir introduced a temporary buffer to store the
emitted readdir data, but as there are file names of variable length,
there's a lot of unaligned access.

This was observed on a sparc64 machine:

  Kernel unaligned access at TPC[102f3080] btrfs_real_readdir+0x51c/0x718 [btrfs]
