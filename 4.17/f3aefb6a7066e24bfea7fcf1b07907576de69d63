sunrpc: remove incorrect HMAC request initialization

make_checksum_hmac_md5() is allocating an HMAC transform and doing
crypto API calls in the following order:

    crypto_ahash_init()
    crypto_ahash_setkey()
    crypto_ahash_digest()

This is wrong because it makes no sense to init() the request before a
key has been set, given that the initial state depends on the key.  And
digest() is short for init() + update() + final(), so in this case
there's no need to explicitly call init() at all.

Before commit 9fa68f620041 ("crypto: hash - prevent using keyed hashes
without setting key") the extra init() had no real effect, at least for
the software HMAC implementation.  (There are also hardware drivers that
implement HMAC-MD5, and it's not immediately obvious how gracefully they
handle init() before setkey().)  But now the crypto API detects this
incorrect initialization and returns -ENOKEY.  This is breaking NFS
mounts in some cases.

Fix it by removing the incorrect call to crypto_ahash_init().
