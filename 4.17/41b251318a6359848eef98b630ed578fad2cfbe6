gpio: gpio-mm: Implement get_multiple callback

The Diamond Systems GPIO-MM series of devices contain two 82C55A
devices, which each feature three 8-bit ports of I/O. Since eight input
lines are acquired on a single port input read, the GPIO-MM GPIO driver
may improve multiple input reads by utilizing a get_multiple callback.
This patch implements the gpiomm_gpio_get_multiple function which serves
as the respective get_multiple callback.
