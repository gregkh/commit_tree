s390/ipl: correct kdump reipl block checksum calculation

s390 kdump reipl implementation relies on os_info kernel structure
residing in old memory being dumped. os_info contains reipl block,
which is used (if valid) by the kdump kernel for reipl parameters.

The problem is that the reipl block and its checksum inside
os_info is updated only when /sys/firmware/reipl/reipl_type is
written. This sets an offset of a reipl block for "reipl_type" and
re-calculates reipl block checksum. Any further alteration of values
under /sys/firmware/reipl/{reipl_type}/ without subsequent write to
/sys/firmware/reipl/reipl_type lead to incorrect os_info reipl block
checksum. In such a case kdump kernel ignores it and reboots using
default logic.

To fix this, os_info reipl block update is moved right before kdump
execution.
