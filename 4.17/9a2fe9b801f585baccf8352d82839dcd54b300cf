ALSA: usb: initial USB Audio Device Class 3.0 support

Recently released USB Audio Class 3.0 specification
introduces many significant changes comparing to
previous versions, like
 - new Power Domains, support for LPM/L1
 - new Cluster descriptor
 - changed layout of all class-specific descriptors
 - new High Capability descriptors
 - New class-specific String descriptors
 - new and removed units
 - additional sources for interrupts
 - removed Type II Audio Data Formats
 - ... and many other things (check spec)

It also provides backward compatibility through
multiple configurations, as well as requires
mandatory support for BADD (Basic Audio Device
Definition) on each ADC3.0 compliant device

This patch adds initial support of UAC3 specification
that is enough for Generic I/O Profile (BAOF, BAIF)
device support from BADD document.
