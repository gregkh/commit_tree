mm/hmm: use device driver encoding for HMM pfn

Users of hmm_vma_fault() and hmm_vma_get_pfns() provide a flags array and
pfn shift value allowing them to define their own encoding for HMM pfn
that are fill inside the pfns array of the hmm_range struct.  With this
device driver can get pfn that match their own private encoding out of HMM
without having to do any conversion.
