powerpc: Mark the variable earlycon_acpi_spcr_enable maybe_unused

Re-use the object-like macro EARLYCON_USED_OR_UNUSED to mark
`earlycon_acpi_spcr_enable` as maybe_unused.

Fix the following warning (treated as error in W=1)

  CC      arch/powerpc/kernel/setup-common.o

                 from arch/powerpc/kernel/setup-common.c:33:

                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
