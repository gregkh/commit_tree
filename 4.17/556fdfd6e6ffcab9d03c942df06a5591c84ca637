i40e/i40evf: Split container ITR into current_itr and target_itr

This patch is mostly prep-work for replacing the current approach to
programming the dynamic aka adaptive ITR. Specifically here what we are
doing is splitting the Tx and Rx ITR each into two separate values.

The first value current_itr represents the current value of the register.

The second value target_itr represents the desired value of the register.

The general plan by doing this is to allow for deferring the update of the
ITR value under certain circumstances. For now we will work with what we
have, but in the future I hope to change the behavior so that we always
only update one ITR at a time using some simple logic to determine which
ITR requires an update.
