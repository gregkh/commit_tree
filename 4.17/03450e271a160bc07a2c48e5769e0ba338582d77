fs: add ksys_fchmod() and do_fchmodat() helpers and ksys_chmod() wrapper; remove in-kernel calls to syscall

Using the fs-internal do_fchmodat() helper allows us to get rid of
fs-internal calls to the sys_fchmodat() syscall.

Introducing the ksys_fchmod() helper and the ksys_chmod() wrapper allows
us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the sys_fchmod() and sys_chmod()
syscalls. The ksys_ prefix denotes that these functions are meant as a
drop-in replacement for the syscalls. In particular, they use the same
calling convention as sys_fchmod() and sys_chmod().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
