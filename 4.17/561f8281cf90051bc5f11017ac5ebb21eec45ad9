rtc: ac100: Fix ac100 determine rate bug

This patch fixes a bug, that prevents the Allwinner A83T and the A80
from a successful boot.

The bug is there since v4.16-rc1 and appeared after the clk branch was
merged.

You can find the shortend trace below:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000000
pgd = (ptrval)
[00000000] *pgd=00000000
Internal error: Oops: 5 [#1] SMP ARM

To fix that bug, we first check if the return of the
clk_hw_get_parent_by_index is non zero. If it is zero we skip that
clock parent.
