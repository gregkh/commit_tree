tracing: Remove igrab() iput() call from uprobes.c

Caller of uprobe_register is required to keep the inode and containing
mount point referenced.

There was misuse of igrab() in uprobes.c and trace_uprobe.c. This is
because igrab() will not prevent umount of the containing mount point.
To fix this, we added path to struct trace_uprobe, which keeps the inode
and containing mount reference.

For uprobes.c, it is not necessary to call igrab() in uprobe_register(),
as the caller is required to keep the inode reference. The igrab() is
removed and comments on this requirement is added to uprobe_register().
