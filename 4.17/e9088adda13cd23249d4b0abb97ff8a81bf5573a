x86/tsc: Always unregister clocksource_tsc_early

Don't leave the tsc-early clocksource registered if it errors out
early.

This was reported by Diego, who on his Core2 era machine got TSC
invalidated while it was running with tsc-early (due to C-states).
This results in keeping tsc-early with very bad effects.
