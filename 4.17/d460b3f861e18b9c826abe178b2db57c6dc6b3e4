ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: Fix master mode clock I2S bus clocks

In the reset state of the codec we do not have complete playback or capture
routes.

The audio playback/capture will not work due to missing clock signals on
the I2S bus if PLL, MDAC/NDAC/DAC MADC/NADC/ADC is powered down.

To make sure that even if all output/input is disconnected the codec is
generating clocks, we need to have valid DAPM route in every case to power
up the must needed parts of the codec.

I have verified that switching DAC (during playback) or ADC (during
capture) will stop the I2S clocks, so the only solution is to connect the
'Off' routes as well to output/input.

The routes will be only added if the codec is clock master. In case the
role changes runtime, the applied routes are removed.

Tested on am43x-epos-evm with aic3111 codec in master mode.
