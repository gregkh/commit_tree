media: platform: vivid-cec: use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Add suffix ULL to constant 10 in order to give the compiler complete
information about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice that this
constant is used in a context that expects an expression of type
u64 (64 bits, unsigned).

The expression len * 10 * CEC_TIM_DATA_BIT_TOTAL is currently being
evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic.

Also, remove unnecessary parentheses and add a code comment to make it
clear what is the reason of the code change.
