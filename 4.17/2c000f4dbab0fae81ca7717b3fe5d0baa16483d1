media: ttpci: improve printing of encoded MAC address

When loading the budget_av driver for ie. a KNC1 DVB-C TDA10024 card,
which makes use of the ttpci eeprom check functionality (that always
fails on these cards, but that's no issue at all), this is printed
to the kernel log:

  [   10.497333] saa7146 (0): dma buffer size 192512
  [   10.497335] dvbdev: DVB: registering new adapter (KNC1 DVB-C TDA10024)
  [   10.545007] adapter failed MAC signature check
  [   10.545009] encoded MAC from EEPROM was
  [   10.545010] ff:
  [   10.545011] ff:
  [   10.545011] ff:
  ...
  [   10.545021] ff
  [   10.832422] budget_av: KNC1-4: MAC addr = 00:09:d6:6d:b3:be

with the 'ff' being repeated for a total of 20 times. Improve that by
using the %*phC format specifier instead dprintk()'ing every byte of the
encoded MAC separately. This obsoletes the int i, and the kernel log
looks cleaner:

  [ 3234.383153] saa7146 (0): dma buffer size 192512
  [ 3234.383154] dvbdev: DVB: registering new adapter (KNC1 DVB-C TDA10024)
  [ 3234.428745] adapter failed MAC signature check
  [ 3234.428747] encoded MAC from EEPROM was ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  [ 3234.728194] budget_av: KNC1-0: MAC addr = 00:09:d6:6d:b3:be
