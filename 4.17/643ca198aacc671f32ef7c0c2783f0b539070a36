drm: rcar-du: lvds: Fix crash in .atomic_check when disabling connector

The connector .atomic_check() handler can be called with a NULL crtc
pointer in the connector state when the connector gets disabled
explicitly (through performing a legacy mode set or setting the
connector's CRTC_ID property to 0). This causes a crash as the crtc
pointer is dereferenced without any check.

Fix it by returning from the .atomic_check() handler when then crtc
pointer is NULL, as there is no check to be performed when the connector
gets disabled.
