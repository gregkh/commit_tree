perf/core: Prepare perf_event.h for new types: 'perf_kprobe' and 'perf_uprobe'

Two new perf types, perf_kprobe and perf_uprobe, will be added to allow
creating [k,u]probe with perf_event_open. These [k,u]probe are associated
with the file decriptor created by perf_event_open(), thus are easy to
clean when the file descriptor is destroyed.

kprobe_func and uprobe_path are added to union config1 for pointers to
function name for kprobe or binary path for uprobe.

kprobe_addr and probe_offset are added to union config2 for kernel
address (when kprobe_func is NULL), or [k,u]probe offset.
