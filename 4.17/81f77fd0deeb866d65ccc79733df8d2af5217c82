bpf: add selftest for stackmap with BPF_F_STACK_BUILD_ID

test_stacktrace_build_id() is added. It accesses tracepoint urandom_read
with "dd" and "urandom_read" and gathers stack traces. Then it reads the
stack traces from the stackmap.

urandom_read is a statically link binary that reads from /dev/urandom.
test_stacktrace_build_id() calls readelf to read build ID of urandom_read
and compares it with build ID from the stackmap.
