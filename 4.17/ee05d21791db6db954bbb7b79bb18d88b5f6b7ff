perf machine: Set main kernel end address properly

map_groups__fixup_end() was called to set the end addresses of kernel
and module maps.  But now since machine__create_modules() sets the end
address of modules properly, the only remaining piece is the kernel map.

We can set it with adjacent module's address directly instead of calling
map_groups__fixup_end().  If there's no module after the kernel map, the
end address will be ~0ULL.

Since it also changes the start address of the kernel map, it needs to
re-insert the map to the kmaps in order to keep a correct ordering.  Kim
reported that it caused problems on ARM64.
