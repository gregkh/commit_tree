drm/rockchip: Don't use spin_lock_irqsave in interrupt context

The rockchip DRM driver is quite careful to disable interrupts
when taking a lock that is also taken in interrupt context,
which is a good thing.

What is a bit over the top is to use spin_lock_irqsave when
already in interrupt context, as you cannot take another
interrupt again, and disabling interrupt is just pure
overhead.

Switching to the non _irqsave version in interrupt context is
more logical, and less heavy handed.
