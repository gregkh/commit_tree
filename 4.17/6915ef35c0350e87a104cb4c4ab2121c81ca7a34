xfs: sanity-check the unused space before trying to use it

In xfs_dir2_data_use_free, we examine on-disk metadata and ASSERT if
it doesn't make sense.  Since a carefully crafted fuzzed image can cause
the kernel to crash after blowing a bunch of assertions, let's move
those checks into a validator function and rig everything up to return
EFSCORRUPTED to userspace.  Found by lastbit fuzzing ltail.bestcount via
xfs/391.
