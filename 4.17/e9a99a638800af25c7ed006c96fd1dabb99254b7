block: clear ctx pending bit under ctx lock

When we insert a request, we set the software queue pending bit while
holding the software queue lock. However, we clear it outside of the
lock, so it's possible that a concurrent insert could reset the bit
after we clear it but before we empty the request list. Afterwards, the
bit would still be set but the software queue wouldn't have any requests
in it, leading us to do a spurious run in the future. This is mostly a
benign/theoretical issue, but it makes the following change easier to
justify.
