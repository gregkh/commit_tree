netfilter: nf_tables: can't fail after linking rule into active rule list

rules in nftables a free'd using kfree, but protected by rcu, i.e. we
must wait for a grace period to elapse.

Normal removal patch does this, but nf_tables_newrule() doesn't obey
this rule during error handling.

It calls nft_trans_rule_add() *after* linking rule, and, if that
fails to allocate memory, it unlinks the rule and then kfree() it --
this is unsafe.

Switch order -- first add rule to transaction list, THEN link it
to public list.

Note: nft_trans_rule_add() uses GFP_KERNEL; it will not fail so this
is not a problem in practice (spotted only during code review).
