x86/pgtable: Don't set huge PUD/PMD on non-leaf entries

The pmd_set_huge() and pud_set_huge() functions are used from
the generic ioremap() code to establish large mappings where this
is possible.

But the generic ioremap() code does not check whether the
PMD/PUD entries are already populated with a non-leaf entry,
so that any page-table pages these entries point to will be
lost.

Further, on x86-32 with SHARED_KERNEL_PMD=0, this causes a
BUG_ON() in vmalloc_sync_one() when PMD entries are synced
from swapper_pg_dir to the current page-table. This happens
because the PMD entry from swapper_pg_dir was promoted to a
huge-page entry while the current PGD still contains the
non-leaf entry. Because both entries are present and point
to a different page, the BUG_ON() triggers.

This was actually triggered with pti-x32 enabled in a KVM
virtual machine by the graphics driver.

A real and better fix for that would be to improve the
page-table handling in the generic ioremap() code. But that is
out-of-scope for this patch-set and left for later work.
