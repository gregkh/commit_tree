dt-bindings: gpio: Add a gpio-reserved-ranges property

Some qcom platforms make some GPIOs or pins unavailable for use
by non-secure operating systems, and thus reading or writing the
registers for those pins will cause access control issues.
Introduce a DT property to describe the set of GPIOs that are
available for use so that higher level OSes are able to know what
pins to avoid reading/writing.
