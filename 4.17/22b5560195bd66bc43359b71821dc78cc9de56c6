nvme-pci: Separate IO and admin queue IRQ vectors

The admin and first IO queues shared the first irq vector, which has an
affinity mask including cpu0. If a system allows cpu0 to be offlined,
the admin queue may not be usable if no other CPUs in the affinity mask
are online. This is a problem since unlike IO queues, there is only
one admin queue that always needs to be usable.

To fix, this patch allocates one pre_vector for the admin queue that
is assigned all CPUs, so will always be accessible. The IO queues are
assigned the remaining managed vectors.

In case a controller has only one interrupt vector available, the admin
and IO queues will share the pre_vector with all CPUs assigned.
