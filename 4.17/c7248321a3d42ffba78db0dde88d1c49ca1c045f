fs: add ksys_dup{,3}() helper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_dup{,3}()

Using ksys_dup() and ksys_dup3() as helper functions allows us to
avoid the in-kernel calls to the sys_dup() and sys_dup3() syscalls.
The ksys_ prefix denotes that these functions are meant as a drop-in
replacement for the syscalls. In particular, they use the same
calling convention as sys_dup{,3}().

In the near future, the fs-external callers of ksys_dup{,3}() should be
converted to call do_dup2() directly. Then, ksys_dup{,3}() can be moved
within sys_dup{,3}() again.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
