Input: atmel_mxt_ts - add touchpad button mapping for Samsung Chromebook Pro

This patch adds the correct platform data information for the Caroline
Chromebook, so that the mouse button does not get stuck in pressed state
after the first click.

The Samus button keymap and platform data definition are the correct
ones for Caroline, so they have been reused here.
