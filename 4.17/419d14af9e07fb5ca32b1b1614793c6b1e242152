bridge: Allow max MTU when multiple VLANs present

If the bridge is allowing multiple VLANs, some VLANs may have
different MTUs.  Instead of choosing the minimum MTU for the
bridge interface, choose the maximum MTU of the bridge members.
With this the user only needs to set a larger MTU on the member
ports that are participating in the large MTU VLANS.
