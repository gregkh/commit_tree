xfs: clean up xfs_mount allocation and dynamic initializers

Most of the generic data structures embedded in xfs_mount are
dynamically initialized immediately after mp is allocated. A few
fields are left out and initialized during the xfs_mountfs()
sequence, after mp has been attached to the superblock.

To clean this up and help prevent premature access of associated
fields, refactor xfs_mount allocation and all dependent init calls
into a new helper. This self-documents that all low level data
structures (i.e., locks, trees, etc.) should be initialized before
xfs_mount is attached to the superblock.
