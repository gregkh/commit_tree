drm/i915/cnl: Add Port F definition.

Some Cannonlake SKUs will come with a full split between
port A and port E. This will be called port F although it
is not a 6th port, but only a split.

Note this patch alone is not sufficient for port F enabling,
it's just the first step.

v2: Fix size of dvo_ports found by Ander.
v3: Adding missing cases from intel_bios.c for Port_F
v4: Adding other missing cases and fix the commit message.
v5: Rebase on top of display headers rework.
v6 (from Paulo): improve commit message, bikeshed bit definitions.
