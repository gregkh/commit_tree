net: systemport: Correclty disambiguate driver instances

While adding the DSA notifier, we will be sending DSA notifications with
info->master that is going to point to a particular net_device instance.

Our logic in bcm_sysport_map_queues() correctly disambiguates net_device
instances that are not covered by our own driver, but it will not make
sure that info->master points to a particular driver instance that we
are interested in. In a system where e.g: two or more SYSTEMPORT
instances are registered, this would lead in programming two or more
times the queue mapping, completely messing with the logic which does
the queue/port allocation and tracking.

Fix this by looking at the notifier_block pointer which is unique per
instance and allows us to go back to our driver private structure, and
in turn to the backing net_device instance.
