perf tests: Fix out of bounds access on array fd when cnt is 100

Currently when cnt is 100 an array bounds overflow occurs on the
assignment of fd[cnt]. Fix this by performing the bounds check on cnt
before writing to fd.

Detected by cppcheck:

tools/perf/tests/bp_account.c:115: (warning) Either the condition
'cnt==100' is redundant or the array 'fd[100]' is accessed at index 100,
which is out of bounds.
