ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Actually honor the DMIC_EN quirk if specified

Before this commit it was possible to set the DMIC_EN quirk in the machine
driver, but it would never be passed to the codec driver so it was a nop.

This commit adds code to actually pass the quirk to the codec driver.

Since the DMIC_EN quirk was ignored before, this commit removes it from
the default quirk settings, to avoid this causing an unexpected functional
change. If we really want the DMIC_EN behavior anywhere it should be
specifically enabled by follow up commits.
