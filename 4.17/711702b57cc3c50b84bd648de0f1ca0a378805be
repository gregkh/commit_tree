KVM: arm/arm64: VGIC/ITS save/restore: protect kvm_read_guest() calls

kvm_read_guest() will eventually look up in kvm_memslots(), which requires
either to hold the kvm->slots_lock or to be inside a kvm->srcu critical
section.
In contrast to x86 and s390 we don't take the SRCU lock on every guest
exit, so we have to do it individually for each kvm_read_guest() call.
Use the newly introduced wrapper for that.
