ARM: dts: r8a7745: sort subnodes of soc node

Sort the subnodes of the soc node to improve maintainability.
The sort key is the address on the bus with instances of the same
IP block grouped together and sorted alphabetically.

Minor whitespace and line-wrapping changes are also made
to match the formatting of R-Car Gen2 SoCs.

This patch should not introduce any functional change.
