s390/qdio: clear intparm during shutdown

During shutdown, qdio returns its ccw device back to control by the
upper-layer driver. But there is a remote chance that by the time where the
IRQ handler gets switched back, the interrupt for the preceding
ccw_device_{clear,halt} hasn't been presented yet.
Upper-layer drivers would then need to handle this IRQ - and since the IO
is issued with an intparm, it could very well be confused with whatever
intparm mechanism the driver uses itself (eg intparm == request address).

So when switching over the IRQ handler, also clear the intparm and have
upper-layer drivers deal with any such delayed interrupt as if it was
unsolicited.
