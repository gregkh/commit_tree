net/ipv4: Initialize proto and ports in flow struct

Updating the FIB tracepoint for the recent change to allow rules using
the protocol and ports exposed a few places where the entries in the flow
struct are not initialized.

For __fib_validate_source add the call to fib4_rules_early_flow_dissect
since it is invoked for the input path. For netfilter, add the memset on
the flow struct to avoid future problems like this. In ip_route_input_slow
need to set the fields if the skb dissection does not happen.
