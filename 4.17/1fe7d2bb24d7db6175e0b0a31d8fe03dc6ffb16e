kbuild: Improve portability of some sed invocations

* Use BREs where EREs aren't necessary.
* Pass -E instead of -r to use EREs. This will be standardized in the
  next POSIX revision[0]. GNU sed supports this since 4.2 (May 2009),
  and busybox since 1.22.0 (Jan 2014).
* Use the [:space:] character class instead of ` \t` in bracket
  expressions. In bracket expressions, POSIX says that <backslash> loses
  its special meaning, so a conforming implementation cannot expand \t
  to <tab>[1].
* In BREs, use interval expressions (\{n,m\}) instead of non-standard
  features like \+ and \?.
* Use a loop instead of -s flag.

There are still plenty of other cases of non-standard sed invocations
(use of ERE features in BREs, in-place editing), but this fixes some
core ones.
