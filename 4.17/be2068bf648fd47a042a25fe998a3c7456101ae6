media: adv7604: Add support for i2c_new_secondary_device

The ADV7604 has thirteen 256-byte maps that can be accessed via the main
I2C ports. Each map has it own I2C address and acts as a standard slave
device on the I2C bus.

Allow a device tree node to override the default addresses so that
address conflicts with other devices on the same bus may be resolved at
the board description level.
