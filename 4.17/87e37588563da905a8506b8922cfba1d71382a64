leaking_addresses: add range check for vsyscall memory

Currently script checks only first and last address in the vsyscall
memory range. We can do better than this. When checking for false
positives against $match, we can convert $match to a hexadecimal value
then check if it lies within the range of vsyscall addresses.

Check whole range of vsyscall addresses when checking for false
positive.
