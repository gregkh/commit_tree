scsi: lpfc: make several unions static, fix non-ANSI prototype

There are several unions that are local to the source and do not need to
be in global scope, so make them static. Also add in a missing void
parameter to functions lpfc_nvme_cmd_template and
lpfc_nvmet_cmd_template to clean up non-ANSI warning.

Cleans up sparse warnings:

'lpfc_iread_cmd_template' was not declared. Should it be static?
