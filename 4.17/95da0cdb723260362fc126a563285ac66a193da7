bpf: add support to read sample address in bpf program

This commit adds new field "addr" to bpf_perf_event_data which could be
read and used by bpf programs attached to perf events. The value of the
field is copied from bpf_perf_event_data_kern.addr and contains the
address value recorded by specifying sample_type with PERF_SAMPLE_ADDR
when calling perf_event_open.
