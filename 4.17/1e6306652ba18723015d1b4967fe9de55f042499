autofs: mount point create should honour passed in mode

The autofs file system mkdir inode operation blindly sets the created
directory mode to S_IFDIR | 0555, ingoring the passed in mode, which can
cause selinux dac_override denials.

But the function also checks if the caller is the daemon (as no-one else
should be able to do anything here) so there's no point in not honouring
the passed in mode, allowing the daemon to set appropriate mode when
required.
