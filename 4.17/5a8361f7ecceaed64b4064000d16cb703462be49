ACPICA: Integrate package handling with module-level code

ACPICA commit 8faf6fca445eb7219963d80543fb802302a7a8c7

This change completes the integration of the recent changes to
package object handling with the module-level code support.

For acpi_exec, the -ep flag is removed.

This change allows table load to behave as if it were a method
invocation. Before this, the definition block definition below would
have loaded all named objects at the root scope. After loading, it
would execute the if statements at the root scope.

DefinitionBlock (...)
{
  Name(OBJ1, 0)

  if (1)
  {
    Device (DEV1)
    {
      Name (_HID,0x0)
    }
  }
  Scope (DEV1)
  {
    Name (OBJ2)
  }
}

The above code would load OBJ1 to the namespace, defer the execution
of the if statement and attempt to add OBJ2 within the scope of DEV1.
Since DEV1 is not in scope, this would incur an AE_NOT_FOUND error.
After this error is emitted, the if block is invoked and DEV1 and its
_HID is added to the namespace.

This commit changes the behavior to execute the if block in place
rather than deferring it until all tables are loaded. The new
behavior is as follows: insert OBJ1 in the namespace, invoke the if
statement and add DEV1 and its _HID to the namespace, add OBJ2 to the
scope of DEV1.
