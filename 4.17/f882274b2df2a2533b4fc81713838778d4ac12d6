btrfs: Remove root arg from btrfs_log_inode_parent

btrfs_log_inode_parent is called from 2 places (btrfs_log_dentry_safe
and btrfs_log_new_name) both of which pass inode->root as the root
argument and the inode itself. Remove the redundant root argument and
get a reference to the root directly from the inode, also remove
redundant root != inode->root check from the same function. No
functional change.
