bpf, x64: save 5 bytes in prologue when ebpf insns came from cbpf

While it's rather cumbersome to reduce prologue for cBPF->eBPF
migrations wrt spill/fill for r15 which is callee saved register
due to bpf_error path in bpf_jit.S that is both used by migrations
as well as native eBPF, we can still trivially save 5 bytes in
prologue for the former since tail calls can never be used there.
cBPF->eBPF migrations also have their own custom prologue in BPF
asm that xors A and X reg anyway, so it's fine we skip this here.
