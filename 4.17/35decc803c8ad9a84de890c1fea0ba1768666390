gpio: Change ISA_BUS_API dependency to selection

The ISA_BUS_API Kconfig option enables the compilation of the ISA bus
driver. The ISA bus driver does not perform any hardware interaction,
and is instead just a thin layer of software abstraction to eliminate
boilerplate code common to ISA-style device drivers. Since ISA_BUS_API
has no dependencies and does not jeopardize the integrity of the system
when enabled, drivers should select it when the ISA bus driver
functionality is needed.
