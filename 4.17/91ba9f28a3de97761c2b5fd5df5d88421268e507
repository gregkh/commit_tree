drm/vmwgfx: Set dmabuf_size when vmw_dmabuf_init is successful

SOU primary plane prepare_fb hook depends upon dmabuf_size to pin up BO
(and not call a new vmw_dmabuf_init) when a new fb size is same as
current fb. This was changed in a recent commit which is causing
page_flip to fail on VM with low display memory and multi-mon failure
when cycle monitors from secondary display.
