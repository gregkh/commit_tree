drm/vblank: Data type fixes for 64-bit vblank sequences.

drm_vblank_count() has an u32 type returning what is a 64-bit vblank count.
The effect of this is when drm_wait_vblank_ioctl() tries to widen the user
space requested vblank sequence using this clipped 32-bit count(when the
value is >= 2^32) as reference, the requested sequence remains a 32-bit
value and gets queued like that. However, the code that checks if the
requested sequence has passed compares this against the 64-bit vblank
count.

With drm_vblank_count() returning all bits of the vblank count, update
drm_crtc_accurate_vblank_count() so that drm_crtc_arm_vblank_event() queues
the correct sequence. Otherwise, this leads to prolonged waits for a vblank
sequence when the current count is >=2^32.

Finally, fix drm_wait_one_vblank() too.
