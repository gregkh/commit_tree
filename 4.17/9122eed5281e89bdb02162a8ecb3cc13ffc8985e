ceph: quota: report root dir quota usage in statfs

This commit changes statfs default behaviour when reporting usage
statistics.  Instead of using the overall filesystem usage, statfs now
reports the quota for the filesystem root, if ceph.quota.max_bytes has
been set for this inode.  If quota hasn't been set, it falls back to the
old statfs behaviour.

A new mount option is also added ('noquotadf') to disable this behaviour.
