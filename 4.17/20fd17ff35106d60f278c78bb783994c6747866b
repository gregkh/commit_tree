arm64: dts: juno: Describe the full GICv2m region

Juno's GICv2m implementation consists of four frames providing 32
interrupts each. Since it is possible to plug in enough PCIe endpoints
to consume more than 32 MSIs, and the driver already has a bodge to
handle multiple frames, let's expose the other three as well.
