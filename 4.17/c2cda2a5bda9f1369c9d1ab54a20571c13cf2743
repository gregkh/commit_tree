timekeeping/ntp: Don't align NTP frequency adjustments to ticks

When the timekeeping multiplier is changed, the NTP error is updated to
correct the clock for the delay between the tick and the update of the
clock. This error is corrected in later updates and the clock appears as
if the frequency was changed exactly on the tick.

Remove this correction to keep the point where the frequency is
effectively changed at the time of the update. This removes a major
source of the NTP error.
