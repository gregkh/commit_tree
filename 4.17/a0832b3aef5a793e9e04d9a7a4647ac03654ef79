s390/ipl: correct ipl parmblock valid checks

In some cases diag308_set_works used to be misused as "we have valid ipl
parmblock", which is not the case when diag308 set works, but there is
no ipl parmblock (diag308 store returns DIAG308_RC_NOCONFIG). Such checks
are adjusted to reuse ipl_block_valid instead of diag308_set_works.
