ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Change defaults to enable jack-detect, analog mics

Change the default quirk settings to enable jack-detect, analog mics.

The old default input mapping of DMIC for non Bay Trail CR devices seems
like a poor default as I'm not aware of any Intel SST + rt5651 using
devices with a DMIC.

All Cherry Trail devices using the bytcr_rt5651 machine driver seem to be
modelled after BYT-CR devices, And the only non CR Bay Trail devices with
a rt5651 codec I'm aware of are the Minnow boards for which we already have
board specific quirks. So it seems better to me to use the BYT-CR defaults
everywhere.

This e.g. makes the Chuwi Hi8 Pro (CWI513) work ootb without needing a
quirk.
