media: dvb-frontends: ves1820: use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Add suffix ULL to constant 10 in order to give the compiler complete
information about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice that this
constant is used in a context that expects an expression of type
u64 (64 bits, unsigned).

The expression fpxin = state->config->xin * 10 is currently being
evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic.
