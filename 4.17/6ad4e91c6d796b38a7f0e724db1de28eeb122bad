net/mlx4_en: Verify coalescing parameters are in range

Add check of coalescing parameters received through ethtool are within
range of values supported by the HW.
Driver gets the coalescing rx/tx-usecs and rx/tx-frames as set by the
users through ethtool. The ethtool support up to 32 bit value for each.
However, mlx4 modify cq limits the coalescing time parameter and
coalescing frames parameters to 16 bits.
Return out of range error if user tries to set these parameters to
higher values.
Change type of sample-interval and adaptive_rx_coal parameters in mlx4
driver to u32 as the ethtool holds them as u32 and these parameters are
not limited due to mlx4 HW.
