Revert "xhci: plat: Register shutdown for xhci_plat"

This reverts commit b07c12517f2aed0add8ce18146bb426b14099392

It is incomplete and causes hangs on devices when shutting down.  It
needs a much more "complete" fix in order to work properly.  As that fix
has not been merged, revert this patch for now before it causes any more
problems.
