cxl: Fix timebase synchronization status on P9

The PSL Timebase register is updated by the PSL to maintain the
timebase.

On P9, the Timebase value is only provided by the CAPP as received the
last time a timebase request was performed.

The timebase requests are initiated through the adapter configuration
or application registers.

The specific sysfs entry "/sys/class/cxl/cardxx/psl_timebase_synced"
is now dynamically updated according the content of the PSL Timebase
register.
