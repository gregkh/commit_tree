net/8390: Fix msg_enable patch snafu

The lib8390 module parameter 'msg_enable' doesn't do anything useful:
it causes an ancient version string to be logged.

Remove redundant code that logs the same string.

In ne.c and wd.c, the value of ei_local->msg_enable is used before
being assigned. Use ne_msg_enable and wd_msg_enable, respectively.

Most of the other 8390 drivers never assign ei_local->msg_enable.
Use the 'msg_enable' module parameter from lib8390 as the default
value.

Eliminate the pointless static and local variables.

Clean up an indentation mistake.

All of these issues originated from the same patch.
