ARM: sunxi: mc-smp: Use DT enable-method for sun9i A80 SMP

Instead of having an early init function check the machine compatible
and installing multi-cluster SMP support for the A80 if it matches,
use a new cpu enable-method string. This makes the platform support
future proof in case anyone manages to add PSCI support.

The original init code for the SMP support is changed into the
.prepare_cpus callback in the smp_operations structure. Instead of
panicing when resources are missing like on some platforms, our code
merely guards against engaging SMP or CPU hotplug and returns an error.
