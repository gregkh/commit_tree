powerpc/64s: Wire up cpu_show_spectre_v1()

Add a definition for cpu_show_spectre_v1() to override the generic
version. Currently this just prints "Not affected" or "Vulnerable"
based on the firmware flag.

Although the kernel does have array_index_nospec() in a few places, we
haven't yet audited all the powerpc code to see where it's necessary,
so for now we don't list that as a mitigation.
