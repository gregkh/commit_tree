usb: core: phy: add missing forward declaration for "struct device"

Currently hcd.c is the only consumer of the usb_phy_roothub logic. This
already includes the required header files so struct device is known.
However, future consumers might not know about struct device.
Add a forward declaration for struct device to fix potential future
consumers which don't include any of the struct device API headers.
