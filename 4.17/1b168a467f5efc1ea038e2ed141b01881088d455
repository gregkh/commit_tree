staging: lustre: update the TODO list

As more people become involved with the progression of the lustre
client it needs to more clear what needs to be done to leave
staging. Update the TODO list with the various bugs and changes
to accomplish this. Some are simple bugs and others are far more
complex task that will change many lines of code. Some even cover
updating the user land utilities to meet the kernel requirements.
Several bugs have already been addressed and just need to be
pushed to the staging tree.
