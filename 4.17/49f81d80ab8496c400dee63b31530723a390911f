drm/pl111: Support handling bridge timings

If the bridge has a too strict setup time for the incoming
signals, we may not be fast enough and then we need to
compensate by outputting the signal on the inverse clock
edge so it is for sure stable when the bridge samples it.

Since bridges in difference to panels does not expose their
connectors, make the connector optional in the display
setup code.
