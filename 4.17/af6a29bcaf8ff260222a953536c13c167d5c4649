tracing: Generalize per-element hist trigger data

Up until now, hist triggers only needed per-element support for saving
'comm' data, which was saved directly as a private data pointer.

In anticipation of the need to save other data besides 'comm', add a
new hist_elt_data struct for the purpose, and switch the current
'comm'-related code over to that.
