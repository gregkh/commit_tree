drm/vc4: Advertise supported modifiers for planes

The IN_FORMATS blob allows the kernel to advertise to userspace which
format/modifier combinations are supported, per plane. Use this to
advertise that we support both T_TILED and linear.

v2:
  - Only advertise T_TILED for RGB (Eric)
  - Actually turn on allow_fb_modifiers (Eric)
