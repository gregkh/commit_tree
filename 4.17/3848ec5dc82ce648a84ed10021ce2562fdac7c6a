af_unix: remove redundant lockdep class

After commit 581319c58600 ("net/socket: use per af lockdep classes for sk queues")
sock queue locks now have per-af lockdep classes, including unix socket.
It is no longer necessary to workaround it.

I noticed this while looking at a syzbot deadlock report, this patch
itself doesn't fix it (this is why I don't add Reported-by).
