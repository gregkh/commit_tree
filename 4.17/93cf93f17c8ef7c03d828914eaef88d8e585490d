f2fs: introduce mount option for fsync mode

Commit "0a007b97aad6"(f2fs: recover directory operations by fsync)
fixed xfstest generic/342 case, but it also increased the written
data and caused the performance degradation. In most cases, there's
no need to do so heavy fsync actually.

So we introduce new mount option "fsync_mode={posix,strict}" to
control the policy of fsync. "fsync_mode=posix" is set by default,
and means that f2fs uses a light fsync, which follows POSIX semantics.
And "fsync_mode=strict" means that it's a heavy fsync, which behaves
in line with xfs, ext4 and btrfs, where generic/342 will pass, but
the performance will regress.
