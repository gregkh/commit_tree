fs: add ksys_unlink() wrapper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_unlink()

Using this wrapper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the
sys_unlink() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is meant
s a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the same
calling convention as sys_unlink().

In the near future, all callers of ksys_unlink() should be converted to
call do_unlinkat() directly or, at least, to operate on regular kernel
pointers.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
