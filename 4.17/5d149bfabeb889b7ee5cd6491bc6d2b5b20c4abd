lightnvm: pblk: add padding distribution sysfs attribute

When pblk receives a sync, all data up to that point in the write buffer
must be comitted to persistent storage, and as flash memory comes with a
minimal write size there is a significant cost involved both in terms
of time for completing the sync and in terms of write amplification
padded sectors for filling up to the minimal write size.

In order to get a better understanding of the costs involved for syncs,
Add a sysfs attribute to pblk: padded_dist, showing a normalized
distribution of sectors padded. In order to facilitate measurements of
specific workloads during the lifetime of the pblk instance, the
distribution can be reset by writing 0 to the attribute.

Do this by introducing counters for each possible padding:
{0..(minimal write size - 1)} and calculate the normalized distribution
when showing the attribute.
