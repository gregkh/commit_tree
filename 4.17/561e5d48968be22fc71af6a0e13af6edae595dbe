RDMA/qedr: eliminate duplicate barriers on weakly-ordered archs

Code includes wmb() followed by writel() in multiple places. writel()
already has a barrier on some architectures like arm64.

This ends up CPU observing two barriers back to back before executing the
register write.

Since code already has an explicit barrier call, changing writel() to
writel_relaxed().
