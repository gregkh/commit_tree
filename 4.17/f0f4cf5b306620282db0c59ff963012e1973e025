x86: Add check for APIC access address for vmentry of L2 guests

According to the sub-section titled 'VM-Execution Control Fields' in the
section titled 'Basic VM-Entry Checks' in Intel SDM vol. 3C, the following
vmentry check must be enforced:

    If the 'virtualize APIC-accesses' VM-execution control is 1, the
    APIC-access address must satisfy the following checks:

	- Bits 11:0 of the address must be 0.
	- The address should not set any bits beyond the processor's
	  physical-address width.

This patch adds the necessary check to conform to this rule. If the check
fails, we cause the L2 VMENTRY to fail which is what the associated unit
test (following patch) expects.
