ibmvnic: Generalize TX pool structure

Remove some unused fields in the structure and include values
describing the individual buffer size and number of buffers in
a TX pool. This allows us to use these fields for TX pool buffer
accounting as opposed to using hard coded values. Include a new
pool array for TSO transmissions.
