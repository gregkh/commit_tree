arm64: capabilities: Filter the entries based on a given mask

While processing the list of capabilities, it is useful to
filter out some of the entries based on the given mask for the
scope of the capabilities to allow better control. This can be
used later for handling LOCAL vs SYSTEM wide capabilities and more.
All capabilities should have their scope set to either LOCAL_CPU or
SYSTEM. No functional/flow change.
