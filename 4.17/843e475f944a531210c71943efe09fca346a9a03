HID: multitouch: remove dead zones of Razer Blade Stealth

The Razer Blade Stealth detects palms too aggressively and this creates
a dead zone around the touchpad. Users like being able to use their
entire touchpad, so we should probably not filter out the "palm" events
from the device and report them as regular touches, leaving the palm
detection up to the upper stack
