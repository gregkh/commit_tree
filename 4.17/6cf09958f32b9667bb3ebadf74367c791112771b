s390: correct module section names for expoline code revert

The main linker script vmlinux.lds.S for the kernel image merges
the expoline code patch tables into two section ".nospec_call_table"
and ".nospec_return_table". This is *not* done for the modules,
there the sections retain their original names as generated by gcc:
".s390_indirect_call", ".s390_return_mem" and ".s390_return_reg".

The module_finalize code has to check for the compiler generated
section names, otherwise no code patching is done. This slows down
the module code in case of "spectre_v2=off".
