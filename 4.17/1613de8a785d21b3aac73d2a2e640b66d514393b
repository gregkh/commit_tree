nds32: Fix the unaligned access handler

If the kernel config 'CONFIG_ALIGNMENT_TRAP' and the file
'/proc/sys/nds32/unaligned_access/enable' are set, the kernel
unaligned access handler does not handle correctly when the
value of immediate field is negative. This commit fixes the
unaligned access handler in kernel.
