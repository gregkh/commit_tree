kconfig: warn unmet direct dependency of tristate symbols selected by y

Commit 246cf9c26bf1 ("kbuild: Warn on selecting symbols with unmet
direct dependencies") forcibly promoted ->dir_dep.tri to yes from mod.
So, the unmet direct dependencies of tristate symbols are not reported.

[Test Case]

  config MODULES
          def_bool y
          option modules

  config A
          def_bool y
          select B

  config B
          tristate "B"
          depends on m

This causes unmet dependency because 'B' is forced 'y' ignoring
'depends on m'.  This should be warned.

On the other hand, the following case ('B' is bool) should not be
warned, so 'depends on m' for bool symbols should be naturally treated
as 'depends on y'.

[Test Case2 (not unmet dependency)]

  config MODULES
          def_bool y
          option modules

  config A
          def_bool y
          select B

  config B
          bool "B"
          depends on m
