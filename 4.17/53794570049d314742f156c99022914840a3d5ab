net-tcp_bbr: set tp->snd_ssthresh to BDP upon STARTUP exit

Set tp->snd_ssthresh to BDP upon STARTUP exit. This allows us
to check if a BBR flow exited STARTUP and the BDP at the
time of STARTUP exit with SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS. Since BBR does not
use snd_ssthresh this fix has no impact on BBR's behavior.
