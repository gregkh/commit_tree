net sched actions: fix refcnt leak in skbmod

When application fails to pass flags in netlink TLV when replacing
existing skbmod action, the kernel will leak refcnt:

$ tc actions get action skbmod index 1
total acts 0

        action order 0: skbmod pipe set smac 00:11:22:33:44:55
         index 1 ref 1 bind 0

For example, at this point a buggy application replaces the action with
index 1 with new smac 00:aa:22:33:44:55, it fails because of zero flags,
however refcnt gets bumped:

$ tc actions get actions skbmod index 1
total acts 0

        action order 0: skbmod pipe set smac 00:11:22:33:44:55
         index 1 ref 2 bind 0
$

Tha patch fixes this by calling tcf_idr_release() on existing actions.
