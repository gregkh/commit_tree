tracing: Add hist trigger timestamp support

Add support for a timestamp event field.  This is actually a 'pseudo-'
event field in that it behaves like it's part of the event record, but
is really part of the corresponding ring buffer event.

To make use of the timestamp field, users can specify
"common_timestamp" as a field name for any histogram.  Note that this
doesn't make much sense on its own either as either a key or value,
but needs to be supported even so, since follow-on patches will add
support for making use of this field in time deltas.  The
common_timestamp 'field' is not a bona fide event field - so you won't
find it in the event description - but rather it's a synthetic field
that can be used like a real field.

Note that the use of this field requires the ring buffer be put into
'absolute timestamp' mode, which saves the complete timestamp for each
event rather than an offset.  This mode will be enabled if and only if
a histogram makes use of the "common_timestamp" field.
