firmware: move loading timeout under struct firmware_fallback_config

The timeout is a fallback construct, so we can just stuff the
timeout configuration under struct firmware_fallback_config.

While at it, add a few helpers which vets the use of getting or
setting the timeout as an int. The main use of the timeout is
to set a timeout for completion, and that is used as an unsigned
long. There a few cases however where it makes sense to get or
set the timeout as an int, the helpers annotate these use cases
have been properly vetted for.
