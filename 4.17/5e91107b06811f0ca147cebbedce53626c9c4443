arm64: capabilities: Move errata work around check on boot CPU

We trigger CPU errata work around check on the boot CPU from
smp_prepare_boot_cpu() to make sure that we run the checks only
after the CPU feature infrastructure is initialised. While this
is correct, we can also do this from init_cpu_features() which
initilises the infrastructure, and is called only on the
Boot CPU. This helps to consolidate the CPU capability handling
to cpufeature.c. No functional changes.
