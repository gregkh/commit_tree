perf evsel: Only fall back group read for leader

Perf doesn't support mixed events from different PMUs (except software
event) in a group. The perf stat should output <not counted>/<not
supported> for all events, but it doesn't. For example,

  perf stat -e '{cycles,uncore_imc_5/umask=0xF,event=0x4/,instructions}'
       <not counted>      cycles
       <not supported>    uncore_imc_5/umask=0xF,event=0x4/
           1,024,300      instructions

If perf fails to open an event, it doesn't error out directly. It will
disable some features and retry, until the event is opened or all
features are disabled. The disabled features will not be re-enabled. The
group read is one of these features.

For the example as above, the IMC event and the leader event "cycles"
are from different PMUs. Opening the IMC event must fail. The group read
feature must be disabled for IMC event and the followed event
"instructions". The "instructions" event has the same PMU as the leader
"cycles". It can be opened successfully. Since the group read feature
has been disabled, the "instructions" event will be read as a single
event, which definitely has a value.

The group read fallback is still useful for the case which kernel
doesn't support group read. It is good enough to be handled only by the
leader.

For the fallback request from members, it must be caused by an error.
The fallback only breaks the semantics of group.  Limit the group read
fallback only for the leader.

Committer testing:

On a broadwell t450s notebook:

Before:

  # perf stat -e '{cycles,unc_cbo_cache_lookup.read_i,instructions}' sleep 1

  Performance counter stats for 'sleep 1':

     <not counted>      cycles
   <not supported>      unc_cbo_cache_lookup.read_i
           818,206      instructions

       1.003170887 seconds time elapsed

  Some events weren't counted. Try disabling the NMI watchdog:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
	perf stat ...
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog

After:

  # perf stat -e '{cycles,unc_cbo_cache_lookup.read_i,instructions}' sleep 1

  Performance counter stats for 'sleep 1':

     <not counted>      cycles
   <not supported>      unc_cbo_cache_lookup.read_i
     <not counted>      instructions

       1.001380511 seconds time elapsed

  Some events weren't counted. Try disabling the NMI watchdog:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
	perf stat ...
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
