serial: expose buf_overrun count through proc interface

The buf_overrun count is only every written, and not exposed to
userspace anywhere. This means that dropped characters due to flip
buffer overruns are never visible to userspace.

The /proc/tty/driver/serial file exports a bunch of metrics (including
hardware overruns) already, so add the buf_overrun (as "bo:") to this
file.
