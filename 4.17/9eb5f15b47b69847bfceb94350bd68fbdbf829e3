xen: xen-pciback: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in pcistub_device_alloc

pcistub_device_alloc() is never called in atomic context.

The call chain ending up at pcistub_device_alloc() is:
[1] pcistub_device_alloc() <- pcistub_seize() <- pcistub_probe()
pcistub_probe() is only set as ".probe" in struct pci_driver.
This function is not called in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
pcistub_device_alloc() calls kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
which can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.
