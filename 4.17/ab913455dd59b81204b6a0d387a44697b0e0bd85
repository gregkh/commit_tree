docs: ip-sysctl.txt: fix name of some ipv6 variables

The name of the following proc/sysctl entries were incorrectly
documented:

    /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface>/max_dst_opts_number
    /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface>/max_hbt_opts_number
    /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface>/max_dst_opts_length
    /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface>/max_hbt_length

Their name was set to the name of the symbol in the .data field of the
control table instead of their .proc name.
