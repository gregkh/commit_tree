drm/rockchip: analogix_dp: set psr activate/deactivate when enable/disable bridge

There's a race between when bridge_disable and when vop_crtc_disable
are called. If the flush timer triggers a new psr work between these,
we will operate eDP without power shutdowned by bridge_disable. In this
case, moving activate/deactivate to enable/disable bridge to avoid it.
