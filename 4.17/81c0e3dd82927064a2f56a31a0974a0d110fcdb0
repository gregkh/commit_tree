drm: rcar-du: Fix legacy DT to create LVDS encoder nodes

The internal LVDS encoders now have their own DT bindings. Before
switching the driver infrastructure to those new bindings, implement
backward-compatibility through live DT patching.

Patching is disabled and will be enabled along with support for the new
DT bindings in the DU driver.
