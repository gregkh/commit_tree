btrfs: adjust return values of btrfs_inode_by_name

Previously, btrfs_inode_by_name() returned 0 which left caller to check
objectid of location even location if the type was invalid.

Let btrfs_inode_by_name() return -EUCLEAN if a corrupted location of a
dir entry is found.  Removal of label out_err also simplifies the
function.
