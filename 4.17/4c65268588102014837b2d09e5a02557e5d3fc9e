nvmet: don't return "any" ip address in discovery log page

Its perfectly valid to assign a nvmet port to listen on "any"
IP address (traddr 0.0.0.0 for ipv4 address family) for IP based
transport ports. However, we must not return this address in
discovery log entries. Instead we need to return the address
where the request was accepted on (req->port address).

Since this is nvme transport specific, introduce an optional
.disc_traddr interface that is designed to check that a
port in question is bound to "any" IP address and if so, set
the traddr from the port where the request came from.
