cpufreq: CPPC: Initialize shared perf capabilities of CPUs

When multiple CPUs are related in one cpufreq policy, the first online
CPU will be chosen by default to handle cpufreq operations. Let's take
cpu0 and cpu1 as an example.

When cpu0 is offline, policy->cpu will be shifted to cpu1. cpu1's perf
capabilities should be initialized. Otherwise, perf capabilities are 0s
and speed change can not take effect.

This patch copies perf capabilities of the first online CPU to other
shared CPUs when policy shared type is CPUFREQ_SHARED_TYPE_ANY.
