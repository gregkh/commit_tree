ice: Start hardware initialization

This patch implements multiple pieces of the initialization flow
as follows:

1) A reset is issued to ensure a clean device state, followed
   by initialization of admin queue interface.

2) Once the admin queue interface is up, clear the PF config
   and transition the device to non-PXE mode.

3) Get the NVM configuration stored in the device's non-volatile
   memory (NVM) using ice_init_nvm.
