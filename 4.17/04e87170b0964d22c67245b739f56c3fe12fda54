net/mlx5: FPGA and IPSec initialization to be before flow steering

Some flow steering namespace initialization (i.e. egress namespace)
might depend on FPGA capabilities. Changing the initialization order
such that the FPGA will be initialized before flow steering.

Flow steering fs cmds initialization might depend on
IPSec capabilities. Changing the initialization order such
that the IPSec will be initialized before flow steering as well.
