PCI: cadence: Set PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64 if a 64-bit BAR was set-up

cdns_pcie_ep_set_bar() does some round-up of the BAR size, which means
that a 64-bit BAR can be set-up, even when the flag
PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64 isn't set.

If a 64-bit BAR was set-up, set the flag PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64,
so that the calling function can know what BAR width that was actually
set-up.

I'm not sure why cdns_pcie_ep_set_bar() doesn't obey the flag
PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64, but I leave this for the MAINTAINER to
fix, since there might be a reason why this flag is ignored.
