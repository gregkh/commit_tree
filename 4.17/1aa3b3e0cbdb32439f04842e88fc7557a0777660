fs: quota: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in dquot_init

dquot_init() is never called in atomic context.
This function is only set as a parameter of fs_initcall().

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
dquot_init() calls __get_free_pages() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which waits busily for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
to avoid busy waiting and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
