afs: Fix whole-volume callback handling

It's possible for an AFS file server to issue a whole-volume notification
that callbacks on all the vnodes in the file have been broken.  This is
done for R/O and backup volumes (which don't have per-file callbacks) and
for things like a volume being taken offline.

Fix callback handling to detect whole-volume notifications, to track it
across operations and to check it during inode validation.
