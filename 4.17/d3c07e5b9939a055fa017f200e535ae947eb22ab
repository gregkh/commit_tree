ip6mr: Add API for default_rule fib

Add the ability to discern whether a given FIB rule notification relates
to the default rule inserted when registering ip6mr or a different one.

Would later be used by drivers wishing to offload ipv6 multicast routes
but unable to offload rules other than the default one.
