serial: imx: warn user when using unsupported configuration

When using half-duplex mode (which disables receiver during txing)
the RTS signal cannot be driven low during transmission when using
i.MX UART RTS/CTS control. This seems to be a limitation of the
i.MX UART IP: The RTS (CTS_B) signal is controlled by the receiver.
When the receiver is disabled, the signal stays in UART logic idle
state which is high...

If SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND is used, RTS needs to be high active during
transmission. Since this is the default state of the RTS (CTS_B)
signal when the receiver is off, half-duplex mode in this
configuration works fine.

However, a low-active RTS signal (flag SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND not set)
cannot be generated when the receiver is turned off.

Print an error if the user selects this unsupported configuration
(both SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND and SER_RS485_RX_DURING_TX unset) and
configure the closest working configuration (set the
SER_RS485_RX_DURING_TX flag).
