btrfs: Open code btrfs_write_and_wait_marked_extents

btrfs_write_and_wait_transaction is essentially a wrapper of
btrfs_write_and_wait_marked_extents with the addition of calling
clear_btree_io_tree. Having the code split doesn't really bring any
benefit. Open code the later into the former and add proper
documentation header.
