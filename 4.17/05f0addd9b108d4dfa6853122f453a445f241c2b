drm/i915/icl: Enhanced execution list support

Enhanced Execlists is an upgraded version of execlists which supports
up to 8 ports. The lrcs to be submitted are written to a submit queue
(the ExecLists Submission Queue - ELSQ), which is then loaded on the
HW. When writing to the ELSP register, the lrcs are written cyclically
in the queue from position 0 to position 7. Alternatively, it is
possible to write directly in the individual positions of the queue
using the ELSQC registers. To be able to re-use all the existing code
we're using the latter method and we're currently limiting ourself to
only using 2 elements.

v2: Rebase.
v3: Switch from !IS_GEN11 to GEN < 11 (Daniele Ceraolo Spurio).
v4: Use the elsq registers instead of elsp. (Daniele Ceraolo Spurio)
v5: Reword commit, rename regs to be closer to specs, turn off
    preemption (Daniele), reuse engine->execlists.elsp (Chris)
v6: use has_logical_ring_elsq to differentiate the new paths
v7: add preemption support, rename els to submit_reg (Chris)
v8: save the ctrl register inside the execlists struct, drop CSB
    handling updates (superseded by preempt_complete_status) (Chris)
v9: s/drm_i915_gem_request/i915_request (Mika)
v10: resolved conflict in inject_preempt_context (Mika)
