Revert "arm64: dts: fsl: fix ifc simple-bus unit address format warnings"

This reverts commit f81d7af7957539b7808961f929f945381530acb9.

As explained by Rob Herring:

"This "fix" is wrong. Memory controllers with chip selects should have
the chip select in the unit-address. The correct fix here is you should
drop "simple-bus"."
