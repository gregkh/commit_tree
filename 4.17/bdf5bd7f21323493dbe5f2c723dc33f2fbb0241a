rds: tcp: remove register_netdevice_notifier infrastructure.

The netns deletion path does not need to wait for all net_devices
to be unregistered before dismantling rds_tcp state for the netns
(we are able to dismantle this state on module unload even when
all net_devices are active so there is no dependency here).

This patch removes code related to netdevice notifiers and
refactors all the code needed to dismantle rds_tcp state
into a ->exit callback for the pernet_operations used with
register_pernet_device().
