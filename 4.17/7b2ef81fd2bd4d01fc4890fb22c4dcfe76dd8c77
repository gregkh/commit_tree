mlxsw: spectrum_span: Extract mlxsw_sp_span_entry_{de, }configure()

Configuring the hardware for encapsulated SPAN involves more code than
the simple mirroring case. Extract the related code to a separate
function to separate it from the rest of SPAN entry creation. Extract
deconfigure as well for symmetry, even though disablement is the same
regardless of SPAN type.
