f2fs: don't track new nat entry in nat set

Nat entry set is used only in checkpoint(), and during checkpoint() we
won't flush new nat entry with unallocated address, so we don't need to
add new nat entry into nat set, then nat_entry_set::entry_cnt can
indicate actual entry count we need to flush in checkpoint().
