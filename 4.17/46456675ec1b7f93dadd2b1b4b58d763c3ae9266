net: Convert rtnetlink_net_ops

rtnetlink_net_init() and rtnetlink_net_exit()
create and destroy netlink socket net::rtnl.

The socket is used to send rtnl notification via
rtnl_net_notifyid(). There is no a problem
to create and destroy it in parallel with other
pernet operations, as we link net in setup_net()
after the socket is created, and destroy
in cleanup_net() after net is unhashed from all
the lists and there is no RCU references on it.
