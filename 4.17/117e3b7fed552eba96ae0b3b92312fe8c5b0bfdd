CIFS: set *resp_buf_type to NO_BUFFER on error

Dan Carpenter had pointed this out a while ago, but the code around
this had changed so wasn't causing any problems since that field
was not used in this error path.

Still, it is cleaner to always initialize this field, so changing
the error path to set it.
