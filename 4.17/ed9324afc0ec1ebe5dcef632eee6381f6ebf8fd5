drm/amdgpu: change gfx9 ib test to use WB

two reasons to switch SCRATCH reg method to WB method:

1)Because when doing IB test we don't want to involve KIQ health
status affect, and since SCRATCH register access is go through
KIQ that way GFX IB test would failed due to KIQ fail.

2)acccessing SCRATCH register cost much more time than WB method
because SCRATCH register access runs through KIQ which at least could
begin after GPU world switch back to current Guest VF
