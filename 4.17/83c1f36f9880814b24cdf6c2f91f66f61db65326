tun: send netlink notification when the device is modified

I added dumping of link information about tun devices over netlink in
commit 1ec010e70593 ("tun: export flags, uid, gid, queue information
over netlink"), but didn't add the missing netlink notifications when
the device's exported properties change.

This patch adds notifications when owner/group or flags are modified,
when queues are attached/detached, and when a tun fd is closed.
