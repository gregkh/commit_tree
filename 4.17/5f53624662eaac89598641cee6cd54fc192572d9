ARM: amba: Make driver_override output consistent with other buses

For AMBA devices with unconfigured driver override, the
"driver_override" sysfs virtual file is empty, while it contains
"(null)" for platform and PCI devices.

Make AMBA consistent with other buses by dropping the test for a NULL
pointer.

Note that contrary to popular belief, sprintf() handles NULL pointers
fine; they are printed as "(null)".
