mm/filemap.c: provide dummy filemap_page_mkwrite() for NOMMU

Building orangefs on MMU-less machines now results in a link error
because of the newly introduced use of the filemap_page_mkwrite()
function:

  ERROR: "filemap_page_mkwrite" [fs/orangefs/orangefs.ko] undefined!

This adds a dummy version for it, similar to the existing
generic_file_mmap and generic_file_readonly_mmap stubs in the same file,
to avoid the link error without adding #ifdefs in each file system that
uses these.
