net/mlx5e: Keep single pre-initialized UMR WQE per RQ

All UMR WQEs of an RQ share many common fields. We use
pre-initialized structures to save calculations in datapath.
One field (xlt_offset) was the only reason we saved a pre-initialized
copy per WQE index.
Here we remove its initialization (move its calculation to datapath),
and reduce the number of copies to one-per-RQ.

A very small datapath calculation is added, it occurs once per a MPWQE
(i.e. once every 256KB), but reduces memory consumption and gives
better cache utilization.

Performance testing:
Tested packet rate, no degradation sensed.
