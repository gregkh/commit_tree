perf pmu: Support wildcards on pmu name in dynamic pmu events

Starting on v4.12 event parsing code for dynamic pmu events already
supports prefix-based matching of multiple pmus when creating dynamic
events. E.g., in a system with the following dynamic pmus:

    mypmu_0
    mypmu_1
    mypmu_2
    mypmu_4

passing mypmu/<config>/ as an event spec will result in the creation of
the event in all of the pmus. This change expands this matching through
the use of fnmatch so glob-like expressions can be used to create events
in multiple pmus. E.g., in the system described above if a user only
wants to create the event in mypmu_0 and mypmu_1, mypmu_[01]/<config>/
can be passed.
