scsi: hisi_sas: fix the issue of setting linkrate register

It is not right to set the register PROG_PHY_LINK_RATE while PHY is still
enabled. So if we want to change PHY linkrate, we need to disable PHY before
setting the register PROG_PHY_LINK_RATE, and then start-up PHY. This patch
is to fix this issue.
