perf cgroup: Rename close_cgroup() to cgroup__put()

It is not really closing the cgroup, but instead dropping a reference
count and if it hits zero, then calling delete, which will, among other
cleanup shores, close the cgroup fd.

So it is really dropping a reference to that cgroup, and the method name
for that is "put", so rename close_cgroup() to cgroup__put() to follow
this naming convention.
