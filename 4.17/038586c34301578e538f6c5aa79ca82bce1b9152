perf list: Add s390 support for detailed/verbose PMU event description

'perf list' with flags -d and -v print a description (-d) or a very
verbose explanation (-v) of CPU specific counter events.  These
descriptions are provided with the json files in directory
pmu-events/arch/s390/*.json.

Display of these descriptions on s390 requires the corresponding json
files.

On s390 this does not work because function is_pmu_core() does not
detect the s390 directory name where the CPU specific events are listed.
On x86 it is:

  /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu

whereas on s390 it is:

  /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpum_cf
  /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpum_sf

Fix this by adding s390 directory name testing to function
is_pmu_core(). This is the same approach as taken for the ARM platform.
