Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Treat Interrupt ACPI resources as always being active-low

Older devices with a serdev attached bcm bt hci, use an Interrupt ACPI
resource to describe the IRQ (rather then a GpioInt resource).

These device seem to all claim the IRQ is active-high and seem to all need
a DMI quirk to treat it as active-low. Instead simply always assume that
Interrupt resource specified IRQs are always active-low.

This fixes the bt device not being able to wake the host from runtime-
suspend on the: Asus T100TAM, Asus T200TA, Lenovo Yoga2 and the Toshiba
Encore, without the need to add 4 new DMI quirks for these models.

This also allows us to remove 2 DMI quirks for the Asus T100TA and Asus
T100CHI series. Likely the 2 remaining quirks can also be removed but I
could not find a DSDT of these devices to verify this.
