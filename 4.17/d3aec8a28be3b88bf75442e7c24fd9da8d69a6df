arm64: capabilities: Restrict KPTI detection to boot-time CPUs

KPTI is treated as a system wide feature and is only detected if all
the CPUs in the sysetm needs the defense, unless it is forced via kernel
command line. This leaves a system with a mix of CPUs with and without
the defense vulnerable. Also, if a late CPU needs KPTI but KPTI was not
activated at boot time, the CPU is currently allowed to boot, which is a
potential security vulnerability.
This patch ensures that the KPTI is turned on if at least one CPU detects
the capability (i.e, change scope to SCOPE_LOCAL_CPU). Also rejetcs a late
CPU, if it requires the defense, when the system hasn't enabled it,
