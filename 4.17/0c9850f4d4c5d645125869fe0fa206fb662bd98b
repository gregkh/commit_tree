udf: Clean up handling of invalid uid/gid

Current code relies on the fact that invalid uid/gid as defined by UDF
2.60 3.3.3.1 and 3.3.3.2 coincides with invalid uid/gid as used by the
user namespaces implementation. Since this is only lucky coincidence,
clean this up to avoid future surprises in case user namespaces
implementation changes. Also this is more robust in presence of valid
(from UDF point of view) uids / gids which do not map into current user
namespace.
