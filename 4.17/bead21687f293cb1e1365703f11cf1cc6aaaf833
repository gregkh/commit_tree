i2c-stm32f4: remove redundant initialization of pointer reg

The pointer reg is assigned a value that is never read, it is later
overwritten with a new value, hence the redundant initialization can
be removed.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-stm32f4.c:352:16: warning: Value stored to 'reg'
during its initialization is never read
