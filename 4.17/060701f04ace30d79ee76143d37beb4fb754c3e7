KVM: arm64: Move userspace system registers into separate function

There's a semantic difference between the EL1 registers that control
operation of a kernel running in EL1 and EL1 registers that only control
userspace execution in EL0.  Since we can defer saving/restoring the
latter, move them into their own function.

The ARMv8 ARM (ARM DDI 0487C.a) Section D10.2.1 recommends that
ACTLR_EL1 has no effect on the processor when running the VHE host, and
we can therefore move this register into the EL1 state which is only
saved/restored on vcpu_put/load for a VHE host.

We also take this chance to rename the function saving/restoring the
remaining system register to make it clear this function deals with
the EL1 system registers.
