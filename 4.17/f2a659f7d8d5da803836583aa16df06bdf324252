thunderbolt: Resume control channel after hibernation image is created

The driver misses implementation of PM hook that undoes what
->freeze_noirq() does after the hibernation image is created. This means
the control channel is not resumed properly and the Thunderbolt bus
becomes useless in later stages of hibernation (when the image is stored
or if the operation fails).

Fix this by pointing ->thaw_noirq to driver nhi_resume_noirq(). This
makes sure the control channel is resumed properly.
