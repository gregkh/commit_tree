drm/i915: Add the missing Y/Yf modifiers for SKL+ sprites

Y/Yf were dropped out from the SKL+ sprite modifier list on account
of some watermark issues Daniel Stone was having. My subsequent testing
seemed to indicate that things work better now, so add the modifiers
back in.

v2: Update the commit message with a better explanation
