ALSA: hda/realtek - adjust the location of one mic

There are two front mics on this machine, if we don't adjust the
location for one of them, they will have the same mixer name,
pulseaudio can't handle this situation.

After applying this FIXUP, they will have different mixer name,
then pulseaudio can handle them correctly.
