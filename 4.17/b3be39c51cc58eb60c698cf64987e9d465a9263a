perf test: Fix test case 23 for s390 z/VM or KVM guests

On s390 perf can be executed on a LPAR with support for hardware events
(i. e. cycles) or on a z/VM or KVM guest where no hardware events are
supported. In this environment use software event named cpu-clock for
this test case.

Use the cpuid infrastructure functions to determine the cpuid on s390
which contains an indication of the cpu counter facility availability.
