ACPICA: Events: Stop unconditionally clearing ACPI IRQs during suspend/resume

Unconditionally clearing ACPI IRQs during suspend/resume can lead to
unexpected IRQ losts. This patch fixes this issue by removing such IRQ
clearing code.

If this patch triggers regression, the regression should be in the GPE
handlers that cannot correctly determine some spurious triggered events as
no-ops. Please report any regression related to this commit to the ACPI
component on kernel bugzilla. Lv Zheng.
