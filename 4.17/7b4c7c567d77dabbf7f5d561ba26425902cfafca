pwm: sun4i: Simplify controller mapping

At the moment we assign our supported compatible strings to a respective
instance of our sun4i_pwm_data structure, even though some of them
are the same.
To avoid further clutter, split out the three different combinations of
features we have at the moment and name them accordingly.
This should make it more obvious which compatible string to use for new
SoCs.
