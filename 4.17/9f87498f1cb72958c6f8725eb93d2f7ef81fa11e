perf tools: Add refcnt into struct mem_info

It's passed along several hists entries in --hierarchy mode, so it's
better we keep track of it.

The current fail I see is that it gets removed in hierarchy --mem-mode
mode, where it's shared in the different hierarchies, but removed from
the template hist entry, so the report crashes.

[ Rename mem_info__aloc() to mem_info__new(), to fix the typo and use the convention for constructors ]
