tipc: remove direct accesses to own_addr field in struct tipc_net

As a preparation to changing the addressing structure of TIPC we replace
all direct accesses to the tipc_net::own_addr field with the function
dedicated for this, tipc_own_addr().

There are no changes to program logics in this commit.
