PCI: Report quirk timings with pci_info() instead of pr_debug()

With "initcall_debug", we report how long every PCI quirk took.  Previously
we used pr_debug(), which means you have to figure out how to enable debug
output.

Log these timings using pci_info() instead so it doesn't depend on DEBUG,
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG, etc.

Also, don't log anything at all unless "initcall_debug" is specified.  This
matches what we do in do_one_initcall_debug().
