drm/omap: silence unititialized variable warning

Smatch complains that "area_free" could be used without being
initialized.  This code is several years old and premusably works fine
so this can't be a very serious bug.  But it's easy enough to silence
the warning.  If "area_free" is false at the end of the function then
we return -ENOMEM.
