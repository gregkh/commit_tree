staging: r8822be: fix typos in header guard macros

The macros for __PHYDMKFREE_H__ and __PHYDM_FEATURES_H__ contain
typos and don't match the #if guard check. Defined them correctly.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: '__PHYDMKFREE_H__' is used as a header guard here, followed
by #define of a different macro [-Wheader-guard]
warning: '__PHYDM_FEATURES_H__' is used as a header guard here, followed
by #define of a different macro [-Wheader-guard]
