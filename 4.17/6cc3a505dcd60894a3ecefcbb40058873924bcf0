drm: mali-dp: Fix bug on scaling with rotation

In the case, when the user wants to scale and rotate a layer by 90/270
degrees, the scaling engine input dimensions' parameters ie width and
height needs to be swapped with respect to the layer's input dimensions.
This means scaling engine input height should be set to layer's input
width and scaling engine input width should be set to
layer's input height.
