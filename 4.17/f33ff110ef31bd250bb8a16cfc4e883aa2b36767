block, char_dev: Use correct format specifier for unsigned ints

register_blkdev() and __register_chrdev_region() treat the major
number as an unsigned int. So print it the same way to avoid
absurd error statements such as:
"... major requested (-1) is greater than the maximum (511) ..."
(and also fix off-by-one bugs in the error prints).

While at it, also update the comment describing register_blkdev().
