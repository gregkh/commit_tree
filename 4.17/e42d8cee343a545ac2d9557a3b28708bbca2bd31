net: qlge: Eliminate duplicate barriers on weakly-ordered archs

Code includes wmb() followed by writel(). writel() already has a barrier on
some architectures like arm64.

This ends up CPU observing two barriers back to back before executing the
register write.

Create a new wrapper function with relaxed write operator. Use the new
wrapper when a write is following a wmb().
