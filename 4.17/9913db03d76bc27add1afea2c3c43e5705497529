ixgbevf: use page_address offset from page

Based on commit 3456fd53421e
("igb: Use page_address offset from page instead of masking virtual address")

Update the handling of page addresses so that we always refer to them using
a void pointer, and try to use the consistent name of va indicating we are
working with a virtual address.
