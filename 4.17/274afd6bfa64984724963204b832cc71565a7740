rcu: Fix misprint in srcu_funnel_exp_start

The srcu_funnel_exp_start() function checks to see if the srcu_struct
structure's expedited grace period counter needs updating to reflect a
newly arrived request for an expedited SRCU grace period.  Unfortunately,
the check is backwards, so this commit reverses the sense of the test.
