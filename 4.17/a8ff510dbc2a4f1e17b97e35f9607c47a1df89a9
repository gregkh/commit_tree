gpio: ws16c48: Implement get_multiple callback

The WinSystems WS16C48 device provides 48 lines of digital I/O accessed
via six 8-bit ports. Since eight input lines are acquired on a single
port input read, the WS16C48 GPIO driver may improve multiple input
reads by utilizing a get_multiple callback. This patch implements the
ws16c48_gpio_get_multiple function which serves as the respective
get_multiple callback.
