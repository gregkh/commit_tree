ARM: dts: keystone-k2e-clocks: Fix missing unit address separator

Commit 95d8b41c765b ("ARM: dts: keystone-k2e-clocks: Add missing unit
name to clock nodes that have regs") fixed the unit names on various
clock nodes but missed out adding the unit address separator on the
clkhyperlink0 clock node. Fix the same.
