thermal: imx: Fix race condition in imx_thermal_probe()

When device boots with T > T_trip_1 and requests interrupt,
the race condition takes place. The interrupt comes before
THERMAL_DEVICE_ENABLED is set. This leads to an attempt to
reading sensor value from irq and disabling the sensor, based on
the data->mode field, which expected to be THERMAL_DEVICE_ENABLED,
but still stays as THERMAL_DEVICE_DISABLED. Afher this issue
sensor is never re-enabled, as the driver state is wrong.

Fix this problem by setting the 'data' members prior to
requesting the interrupts.
