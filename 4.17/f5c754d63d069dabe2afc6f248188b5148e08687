mm/swap_state.c: make bool enable_vma_readahead and swap_vma_readahead() static

The bool enable_vma_readahead and swap_vma_readahead() are local to the
source and do not need to be in global scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:

  mm/swap_state.c:41:6: warning: symbol 'enable_vma_readahead' was not declared. Should it be static?
  mm/swap_state.c:742:13: warning: symbol 'swap_vma_readahead' was not declared. Should it be static?
