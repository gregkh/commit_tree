scsi: lpfc: Fix SCSI io host reset causing kernel crash

During SCSI error handling escalation to host reset, the SCSI io
routines were moved off the txcmplq, but the individual io's ON_CMPLQ
flag wasn't cleared.  Thus, a background thread saw the io and attempted
to access it as if on the txcmplq.

Clear the flag upon removal.
