powerpc/rfi-flush: Move the logic to avoid a redo into the debugfs code

rfi_flush_enable() includes a check to see if we're already
enabled (or disabled), and in that case does nothing.

But that means calling setup_rfi_flush() a 2nd time doesn't actually
work, which is a bit confusing.

Move that check into the debugfs code, where it really belongs.
