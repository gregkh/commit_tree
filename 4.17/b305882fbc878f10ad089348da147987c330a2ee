mmc: core: optimize mmc_calc_max_discard

If the max_discard value is zero, the conditional branch that checks the
trim capabilities will never update this value with max_trim.

Change the condition statement to also check the max_discard value in order
to avoid an unnecessary call to mmc_do_calc_max_discard.
