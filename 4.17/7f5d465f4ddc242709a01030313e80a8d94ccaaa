docs: clarify security-bugs disclosure policy

I think we need to soften the language a bit.  It might scare folks
off, especially the:

	 We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible.

which is not really the case.  Linus says:

	It's not full disclosure, it's not coordinated disclosure,
	and it's not "no disclosure".  It's more like just "timely
	open fixes".

I changed a bit of the wording in here, but mostly to remove the word
"disclosure" since it seems to mean very specific things to people
that we do not mean here.
