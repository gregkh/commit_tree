ARM: dts: meson8b: grow the reset controller memory zone

The reset controller in the Meson8b SoCs also supports level resets.
These use the same defines (from
dt-bindings/reset/amlogic,meson8b-reset.h) as the reset pulses.

The reset-meson driver internally handles the difference if a consumer
requests a reset pulse or a level reset. However, for this to work we
must extend the memory zone of the reset controller.
