ipmi: add an Aspeed KCS IPMI BMC driver

The KCS (Keyboard Controller Style) interface is used to perform in-band
IPMI communication between a server host and its BMC (BaseBoard Management
Controllers).

This driver exposes the KCS interface on ASpeed SOCs (AST2400 and AST2500)
as a character device. Such SOCs are commonly used as BMCs and this driver
implements the BMC side of the KCS interface.
