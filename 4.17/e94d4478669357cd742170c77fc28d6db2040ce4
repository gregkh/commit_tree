ice: Implement filter sync, NDO operations and bump version

This patch implements multiple pieces of functionality:

1. Added ice_vsi_sync_filters, which is called through the service task
   to push filter updates to the hardware.

2. Add support to enable/disable promiscuous mode on an interface.
   Enabling/disabling promiscuous mode on an interface results in
   addition/removal of a promisc filter rule through ice_vsi_sync_filters.

3. Implement handlers for ndo_set_mac_address, ndo_change_mtu,
   ndo_poll_controller and ndo_set_rx_mode.

This patch also marks the end of the driver addition by bumping up the
driver version.
