HID: hidraw: Fix crash on HIDIOCGFEATURE with a destroyed device

Doing `ioctl(HIDIOCGFEATURE)` in a tight loop on a hidraw device
and then disconnecting the device, or unloading the driver, can
cause a NULL pointer dereference.

When a hidraw device is destroyed it sets 0 to `dev->exist`.
Most functions check 'dev->exist' before doing its work, but
`hidraw_get_report()` was missing that check.
