serial: arc_uart: Fix out-of-bounds access through DT alias

The arc_uart_ports[] array is indexed using a value derived from the
"serialN" alias in DT, which may lead to an out-of-bounds access.

Fix this by adding a range check.

Note that the array size is defined by a Kconfig symbol
(CONFIG_SERIAL_ARC_NR_PORTS), so this can even be triggered using a
legitimate DTB.
