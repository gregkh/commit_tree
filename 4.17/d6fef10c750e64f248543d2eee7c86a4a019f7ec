ice: Fix insufficient memory issue in ice_aq_manage_mac_read

For the MAC read operation, the device can return up to two (LAN and WoL)
MAC addresses. Without access to adequate memory, the device will return
an error. Fixed this by allocating the right amount of memory. Also, logic
to detect and copy the LAN MAC address into the port_info structure has
been added. Note that the WoL MAC address is ignored currently as the WoL
feature isn't supported yet.
