powerpc/mm/slice: Consolidate return path in slice_get_unmapped_area()

In a following patch, on finding a free area we will need to do
allocatinon of extra contexts as needed. Consolidating the return path
for slice_get_unmapped_area() will make that easier.

Split into a separate patch to make review easy.
