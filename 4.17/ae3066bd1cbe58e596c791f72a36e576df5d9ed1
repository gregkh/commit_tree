powerpc/mm/slice: implement slice_check_range_fits

Rather than build slice masks from a range then use that to check for
fit in a candidate mask, implement slice_check_range_fits that checks
if a range fits in a mask directly.

This allows several structures to be removed from stacks, and also we
don't expect a huge range in a lot of these cases, so building and
comparing a full mask is going to be more expensive than testing just
one or two bits of the range.

On POWER8, this increases vfork+exec+exit performance by 0.3%
and reduces time to mmap+munmap a 64kB page by 5%.
