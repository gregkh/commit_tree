drm/etnaviv: add hardware database

New versions of the Vivante kernel driver don't trust the hardware feature
bits anymore, but use an internal hardware database. This also includes
more feature fields than are available in hardware.

As we can't trust the hardware feature bits to be correct anymore, we need
to replicate the HWDB in etanviv. For now only the GC7000L as found on
the i.MX8M is supported.
