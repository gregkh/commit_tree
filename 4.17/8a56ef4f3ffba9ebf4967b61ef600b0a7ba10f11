ALSA: rawmidi: Fix missing input substream checks in compat ioctls

Some rawmidi compat ioctls lack of the input substream checks
(although they do check only for rfile->output).  This many eventually
lead to an Oops as NULL substream is passed to the rawmidi core
functions.

Fix it by adding the proper checks before each function call.

The bug was spotted by syzkaller.
