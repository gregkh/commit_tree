perf/core: Fix tree based event rotation

Similar to how first programming cpu=-1 and then cpu=# is wrong, so is
rotating both. It was especially wrong when we were still programming
the PMU in this same order, because in that scenario we might never
actually end up running cpu=# events at all.

Cure this by using the active_list to pick the rotation event; since
at programming we already select the left-most event.
