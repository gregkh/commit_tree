ipmr,ipmr6: Define a uniform vif_device

The two implementations have almost identical structures - vif_device and
mif_device. As a step toward uniforming the mr_tables, eliminate the
mif_device and relocate the vif_device definition into a new common
header file.

Also, introduce a common initializing function for setting most of the
vif_device fields in a new common source file. This requires modifying
the ipv{4,6] Kconfig and ipv4 makefile as we're introducing a new common
config option - CONFIG_IP_MROUTE_COMMON.
