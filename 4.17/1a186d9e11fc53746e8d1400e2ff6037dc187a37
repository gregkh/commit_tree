cpufreq: ACPI: Don't validate the frequency table twice

The cpufreq core is already validating the CPU frequency table after
calling the ->init() callback of the cpufreq drivers and the drivers
don't need to do the same anymore. Though they need to set the
policy->freq_table field directly from the ->init() callback now.

Stop validating the frequency table in the acpi-cpufreq driver.

The driver needs to crosscheck if the max frequency corresponds to the
P-state 0 or not and the same is done from the ->ready() callback now.
