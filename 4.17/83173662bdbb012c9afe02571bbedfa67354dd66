ARM: dts: rockchip: Support UHS mode for SD card on phyCORE-RK3288 RDK

The phyCORE-RK3288 RDK could enable SD3.0 card but need vdd_io_sd to
support the voltage range from 1.8V to 3.3V.
And we have also to add relevant UHS modes to the sdmmc node.
Let's also turn off the vdd_io_sd regulator in suspend state.
