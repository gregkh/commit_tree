btrfs: Remove redundant memory barriers around dio_private error status

Using any kind of memory barriers around atomic operations which have
a return value is redundant, since those operations themselves are
fully ordered. atomic_t.txt states:

    - RMW operations that have a return value are fully ordered;

    Fully ordered primitives are ordered against everything prior and
    everything subsequent. Therefore a fully ordered primitive is like
    having an smp_mb() before and an smp_mb() after the primitive.

Given this let's replace the extra memory barriers with comments.
