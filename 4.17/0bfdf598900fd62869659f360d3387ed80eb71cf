powerpc/64: Fix smp_wmb barrier definition use use lwsync consistently

asm/barrier.h is not always included after asm/synch.h, which meant
it was missing __SUBARCH_HAS_LWSYNC, so in some files smp_wmb() would
be eieio when it should be lwsync. kernel/time/hrtimer.c is one case.

__SUBARCH_HAS_LWSYNC is only used in one place, so just fold it in
to where it's used. Previously with my small simulator config, 377
instances of eieio in the tree. After this patch there are 55.
