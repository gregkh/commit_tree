tracing: Fix regex_match_front() to not over compare the test string

The regex match function regex_match_front() in the tracing filter logic,
was fixed to test just the pattern length from testing the entire test
string. That is, it went from strncmp(str, r->pattern, len) to
strcmp(str, r->pattern, r->len).

The issue is that str is not guaranteed to be nul terminated, and if r->len
is greater than the length of str, it can access more memory than is
allocated.

The solution is to add a simple test if (len < r->len) return 0.
