sched/wait: add wait_event_idle() functions.

The new TASK_IDLE state (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE | __TASK_NOLOAD)
is not much used.  One way to make it easier to use is to
add wait_event*() family functions that make use of it.
This patch adds:
  wait_event_idle()
  wait_event_idle_timeout()
  wait_event_idle_exclusive()
  wait_event_idle_exclusive_timeout()

This set was chosen because lustre needs them before
it can discard its own l_wait_event() macro.
