ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Add new IN2_HS_IN3 input map and a quirk using it

Add a new IN2_HS_IN3 input map and add a quirk for the input mapping and
jack-detect source for the Chuwi Vi8 Plus tablet, which uses this new map.

Note the Chuwi Vi8 Plus lists an extra GPIO in its codecs ACPI resources
which needs to be driven high to enable the external speaker amplifier,
this is not supported yet and will be fixed in a future patch.
