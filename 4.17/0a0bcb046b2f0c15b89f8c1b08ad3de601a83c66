IB/hfi1: Fix loss of BECN with AHG

AHG may be armed to use the stored header, which by design is limited
to edits in the PSN/A 32 bit word (bth2).

When the code is trying to send a BECN, the use of the stored header
will lose the BECN bit.

Fix by avoiding AHG when getting ready to send a BECN. This is
accomplished by always claiming the packet is not a middle packet which
is an AHG precursor.  BECNs are not a normal case and this should not
hurt AHG optimizations.
