Documentation/features: Allow comments in arch features files

The list-arch.sh script considers lines beginning with "#" as match for
the feature table.

Given that those tables are never in lines beginning with "#",
add a reverse grep on "^#" when matching the "ok/TODO" state of
the architecture.

This allows adding comments within the feature files, for instance
describing the architecture requirements for the feature in each
architecture.
