arm64: cmpxchg: Include build_bug.h instead of bug.h for BUILD_BUG

Having asm/cmpxchg.h pull in linux/bug.h is problematic because this
ends up pulling in the atomic bitops which themselves may be built on
top of atomic.h and cmpxchg.h.

Instead, just include build_bug.h for the definition of BUILD_BUG.
