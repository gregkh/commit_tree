mtd: rawnand: avoid setting again the timings to mode 0 after a reset

After a nand_reset_data_interface(), both the NAND chip and the NAND
controller use timing mode 0. The previously defined data interface for
this chip has been saved and is supposed to be restored after that.
However, if the saved data interface also refers to timing mode 0, there
is no need to re-apply them again.

Also, as nand_setup_data_interface() uses ->set/get_features(), it could
lead to issues when doing the reset at probe time as the parameter page
is not available yet to know if these functions are supported or not.
