mmc: tmio: support IP-builtin card detection logic

A card detect GPIO is set up only for platforms with "cd-gpios"
DT property or TMIO_MMC_USE_GPIO_CD flag.  However, the driver
core always uses mmc_gpio_get_cd, which just fails with -ENOSYS
if ctx->cd_gpio is unset.

The bit 5 of the status register provides the current signal level
of the CD line.  Allow to use it if the GPIO is unused.
