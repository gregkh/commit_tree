media: mceusb: add IR learning support features (IR carrier frequency measurement and wide-band/short-range receiver)

Windows Media Center IR transceivers include two IR receivers;
wide-band/short-range and narrow-band/long-range. The short-range
(5cm distance) receiver is for IR learning and has IR carrier
frequency measuring ability.

Add mceusb driver support to select the short range IR receiver
and enable pass through of its IR carrier frequency measurements.

RC and LIRC already support these mceusb driver additions.

Test platform:
