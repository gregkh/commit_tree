arm64: KVM: Move stashing of x0/x1 into the vector code itself

All our useful entry points into the hypervisor are starting by
saving x0 and x1 on the stack. Let's move those into the vectors
by introducing macros that annotate whether a vector is valid or
not, thus indicating whether we want to stash registers or not.

The only drawback is that we now also stash registers for el2_error,
but this should never happen, and we pop them back right at the
start of the handling sequence.
