spi: Fix unregistration of controller with fixed SPI bus number

Commit 9b61e302210e (spi: Pick spi bus number from Linux idr or spi alias)
ceased to unregister SPI buses with fixed bus numbers. Moreover this is
visible only if CONFIG_SPI_DEBUG=y is set or when trying to re-register
the same SPI controller.

rmmod spi_pxa2xx_platform (with CONFIG_SPI_DEBUG=y):
[   26.788362] spi_master spi1: attempting to delete unregistered controller [spi1]

modprobe spi_pxa2xx_platform:

Fix this by not returning immediately from spi_unregister_controller() if
idr_find() doesn't find controller with given ID/bus number. It finds
only those controllers that were registered with dynamic SPI bus
numbers. Only conditional cleanup between dynamic and fixed bus numbers
is to remove allocated IDR.
