bpf: fix uninitialized variable in bpf tools

Here the variable cont is used as the saved_pointer for a call to
strtok_r(). It is safe to use the value uninitialized in this
context however and the later reference is only ever used if
the strtok_r is successful. But, 'gcc-5' at least doesn't have all
this knowledge so initialize cont to NULL. Additionally, do the
natural NULL check before accessing just for completness.

The warning is the following:

./bpf/tools/bpf/bpf_dbg.c: In function ‘cmd_load’:
./bpf/tools/bpf/bpf_dbg.c:1077:13: warning: ‘cont’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  } else if (matches(subcmd, "pcap") == 0) {
