staging: rtl8723bs: Remove braces from single statement conditionals.

Several conditionals in rtw_wx_set_auth() contain a comment then a
single statement.  Move the comments to the top of the conditionals
so that braces can be removed from the statements, which saves space
and makes the code more readable.
