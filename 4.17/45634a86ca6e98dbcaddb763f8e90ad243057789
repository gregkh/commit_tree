scsi: lpfc: Treat SCSI Write operation Underruns as an error

Currently, write underruns (mismatch of amount transferred vs scsi
status and its residual) detected by the adapter are not being flagged
as an error. Its expected the target controls the data transfer and
would appropriately set the RSP values.  Only read underruns are treated
as errors.

Revise the SCSI error handling to treat write underruns as an error as
well.
