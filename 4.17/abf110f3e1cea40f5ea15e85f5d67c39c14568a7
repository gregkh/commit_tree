powerpc/rfi-flush: Make it possible to call setup_rfi_flush() again

For PowerVM migration we want to be able to call setup_rfi_flush()
again after we've migrated the partition.

To support that we need to check that we're not trying to allocate the
fallback flush area after memblock has gone away (i.e., boot-time only).
