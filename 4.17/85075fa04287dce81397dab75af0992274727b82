drm/amd/display: add psr_version to stream

Brightness could not be changed for some panels whose DPCD_version is below 1.2
Now psr_version is added into stream, and it copies from the displayTarget's psr_version.
It checks if the stream's psr_versio is non-zero and sets the vsc info packet revision now.
