arm64/debug: Fix registers on sleeping tasks

This is the equivalent of commit 001bf455d206 ("ARM: 8428/1: kgdb: Fix
registers on sleeping tasks") but for arm64.  Nuff said.

...well, perhaps I could also add that task_pt_regs are userspace
registers and that's not what kgdb is supposed to be reporting.  We're
supposed to be reporting kernel registers.
