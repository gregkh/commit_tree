staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Fix incorrect kfree

Use netdev_alloc_frag() instead of kmalloc to allocate space for
the S/G table of egress multi-buffer frames.

This fixes a bug where an unaligned pointer received from the
allocator would be overwritten with the 64B aligned value,
leading to a wrong address being later passed to kfree.
