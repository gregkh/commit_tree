ALSA: hdspm: Hardening for potential Spectre v1

As recently Smatch suggested, a couple of places in HDSP MADI driver
may expand the array directly from the user-space value with
speculation:
  sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c:5717 snd_hdspm_channel_info() warn: potential spectre issue 'hdspm->channel_map_out' (local cap)
  sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c:5734 snd_hdspm_channel_info() warn: potential spectre issue 'hdspm->channel_map_in' (local cap)

This patch puts array_index_nospec() for hardening against them.
