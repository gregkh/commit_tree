clk: meson: poke pll CNTL last

Poking CNTL first may take the PLL out of reset while we are still
applying the initial settings, including the filter values
initialization. This is the case for the axg and gxl gp0 pll.

Doing this poke last ensures the pll stays in reset while the initial
settings are applied.
