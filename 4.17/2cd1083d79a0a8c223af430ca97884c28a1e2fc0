iommu/amd: Make amd_iommu_devtable_lock a spin_lock

Before commit 0bb6e243d7fb ("iommu/amd: Support IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA type
allocation") amd_iommu_devtable_lock had a read_lock() user but now
there are none. In fact, after the mentioned commit we had only
write_lock() user of the lock. Since there is no reason to keep it as
writer lock, change its type to a spin_lock.
I *think* that we might even be able to remove the lock because all its
current user seem to have their own protection.
