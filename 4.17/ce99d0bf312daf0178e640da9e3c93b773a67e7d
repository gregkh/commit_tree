kbuild: clear LDFLAGS in the top Makefile

Currently LDFLAGS is not cleared, so same flags are accumulated in
LDFLAGS when the top Makefile is recursively invoked.

I found unneeded rebuild for ARCH=arm64 when CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS
is enabled.  If include/generated/autoksyms.h is updated, the top
Makefile is recursively invoked, then arch/arm64/Makefile adds one
more '-maarch64linux'.  Due to the command line change, modules are
rebuilt needlessly.
