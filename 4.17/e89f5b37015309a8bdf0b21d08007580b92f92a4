dma-mapping: Don't clear GFP_ZERO in dma_alloc_attrs

Revert the clearing of __GFP_ZERO in dma_alloc_attrs and move it to
dma_direct_alloc for now.  While most common architectures always zero dma
cohereny allocations (and x86 did so since day one) this is not documented
and at least arc and s390 do not zero without the explicit __GFP_ZERO
argument.
