Documentation/cdrom: fix German sharp s in LaTex

Apparently the LaTex abbreviation for the German "sharp s" (ÃŸ)
(Unicode U+00DF) has changed from {\sz} to {\ss}.  With {\sz},
I get this error at line 1016 (line number after another patch):

! Undefined control sequence.
l.1016 ...nel~2.0.  Further thanks to Heiko Ei{\sz
                                                  }feldt,

This is fixed by changing the {\sz} to {\ss}.
