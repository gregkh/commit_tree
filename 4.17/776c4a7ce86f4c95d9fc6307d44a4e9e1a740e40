btrfs: Use sizeof directly instead of a constant variable

The kernel would like to have all stack VLA usage removed[1].
Unfortunately using an integer constant variable as the size of an
array is still considered a VLA. Instead let's use directly sizeof(var)
which removes the VLA usage. Use the occasion to remove csum_size
altogether and use sizeof() also for the size passed to memcmp
