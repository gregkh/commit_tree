kconfig: clean-up reverse dependency help implementation

This commit splits out the special E_OR handling ('-' instead of '||')
into a dedicated helper expr_print_revdev().

Restore the original expr_print() prior to commit 1ccb27143360
("kconfig: make "Selected by:" and "Implied by:" readable").

This makes sense because:

  - We need to chop those expressions only when printing the reverse
    dependency, and only when E_OR is encountered

  - Otherwise, it should be printed as before, so fall back to
    expr_print()

This also improves the behavior; for a single line, it was previously
displayed in the same line as "Selected by", like this:

  Selected by: A [=n] && B [=n]

This will be displayed in a new line, consistently:

  Selected by:
  - A [=n] && B [=n]
