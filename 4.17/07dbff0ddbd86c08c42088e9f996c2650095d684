usb: core: add a wrapper for the USB PHYs on the HCD

Many SoC platforms have separate devices for the USB PHY which are
registered through the generic PHY framework. These PHYs have to be
enabled to make the USB controller actually work. They also have to be
disabled again on shutdown/suspend.

Currently (at least) the following HCI platform drivers are using custom
code to obtain all PHYs via devicetree for the roothub/controller and
disable/enable them when required:
- ehci-platform.c has ehci_platform_power_{on,off}
- xhci-mtk.c has xhci_mtk_phy_{init,exit,power_on,power_off}
- ohci-platform.c has ohci_platform_power_{on,off}

With this new wrapper the USB PHYs can be specified directly in the
USB controller's devicetree node (just like on the drivers listed
above). This allows SoCs like the Amlogic Meson GXL family to operate
correctly once this is wired up correctly. These SoCs use a dwc3
controller and require all USB PHYs to be initialized (if one of the USB
PHYs it not initialized then none of USB port works at all).
