RDMA/qedr: Fix wmb usage in qedr

This patch comes as a result of Sinan Kaya's work and the decision that
writel() must be a strong enough barrier for DMA.

wmb usages in qedr driver have either been removed where they were there
only to order DMA accesses, and replaced with smp_wmb and comments for the
places that the barrier was there for SMP reasons.
