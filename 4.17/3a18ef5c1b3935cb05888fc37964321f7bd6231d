fs: add ksys_umount() helper; remove in-kernel call to sys_umount()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel call to the sys_umount()
syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is meant as a drop-in
replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the same calling
convention as ksys_umount().

In the near future, the only fs-external caller of ksys_umount() should be
converted to call do_umount() directly. Then, ksys_umount() can be moved
within sys_umount() again.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
