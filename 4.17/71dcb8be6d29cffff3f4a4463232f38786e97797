arm64: KVM: Allow far branches from vector slots to the main vectors

So far, the branch from the vector slots to the main vectors can at
most be 4GB from the main vectors (the reach of ADRP), and this
distance is known at compile time. If we were to remap the slots
to an unrelated VA, things would break badly.

A way to achieve VA independence would be to load the absolute
address of the vectors (__kvm_hyp_vector), either using a constant
pool or a series of movs, followed by an indirect branch.

This patches implements the latter solution, using another instance
of a patching callback. Note that since we have to save a register
pair on the stack, we branch to the *second* instruction in the
vectors in order to compensate for it. This also results in having
to adjust this balance in the invalid vector entry point.
