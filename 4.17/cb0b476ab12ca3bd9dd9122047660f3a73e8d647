fs/quota: add kernel_quotactl() helper; remove in-kernel call to syscall

Using the fs-internal kernel_quotactl() helper allows us to get rid of
the fs-internal call to the sys_quotactl() syscall.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
