Btrfs: fix unexpected cow in run_delalloc_nocow

Fstests generic/475 provides a way to fail metadata reads while
checking if checksum exists for the inode inside run_delalloc_nocow(),
and csum_exist_in_range() interprets error (-EIO) as inode having
checksum and makes its caller enter the cow path.

In case of free space inode, this ends up with a warning in
cow_file_range().

The same problem applies to btrfs_cross_ref_exist() since it may also
read metadata in between.

With this, run_delalloc_nocow() bails out when errors occur at the two
places.
