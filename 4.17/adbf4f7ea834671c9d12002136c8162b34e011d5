ovl: consistent d_ino for non-samefs with xino

When overlay layers are not all on the same fs, but all inode numbers
of underlying fs do not use the high 'xino' bits, overlay st_ino values
are constant and persistent.

In that case, relax non-samefs constraint for consistent d_ino and always
iterate non-merge dir using ovl_fill_real() actor so we can remap lower
inode numbers to unique lower fs range.
