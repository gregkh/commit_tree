mmc: core: Prevent bus reference leak in mmc_blk_init()

Upon module load, mmc_block allocates a bus with bus_registeri() in
mmc_blk_init(). This reference never gets freed during module unload, which
leads to subsequent re-insertions of the module fails and a WARN() splat is
triggered.

Fix the bug by dropping the reference for the bus in mmc_blk_exit().
