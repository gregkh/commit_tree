dt-bindings: mailbox: add support for mailbox client shared memory

Many users of the mailbox controllers depend on the shared memory
between the two end points to exchange the main data while using simple
doorbell mechanism to alert the end points of the presence of a message.

This patch defines device tree bindings to represent such shared memory
in a generic way.
