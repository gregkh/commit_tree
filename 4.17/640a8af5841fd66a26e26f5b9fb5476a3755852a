i40evf: Reorder configure_clsflower to avoid deadlock on error

While doing some code review I noticed that we can get into a state where
we exit with the "IN_CRITICAL_TASK" bit set while notifying the PF of
flower filters. This patch is meant to address that plus tweak the ordering
of the while loop waiting on it slightly so that we don't wait an extra
period after we have failed for the last time.
