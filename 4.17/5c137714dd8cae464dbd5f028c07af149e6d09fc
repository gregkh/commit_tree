arm64: capabilities: Introduce weak features based on local CPU

Now that we have the flexibility of defining system features based
on individual CPUs, introduce CPU feature type that can be detected
on a local SCOPE and ignores the conflict on late CPUs. This is
applicable for ARM64_HAS_NO_HW_PREFETCH, where it is fine for
the system to have CPUs without hardware prefetch turning up
later. We only suffer a performance penalty, nothing fatal.
