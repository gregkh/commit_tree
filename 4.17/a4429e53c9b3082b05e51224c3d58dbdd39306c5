KVM: Introduce paravirtualization hints and KVM_HINTS_DEDICATED

This patch introduces kvm_para_has_hint() to query for hints about
the configuration of the guests.  The first hint KVM_HINTS_DEDICATED,
is set if the guest has dedicated physical CPUs for each vCPU (i.e.
pinning and no over-commitment).  This allows optimizing spinlocks
and tells the guest to avoid PV TLB flush.
