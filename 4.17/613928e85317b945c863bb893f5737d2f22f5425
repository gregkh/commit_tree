media: v4l: vsp1: Fix header display list status check in continuous mode

To allow dual pipelines utilising two WPF entities when available, the
VSP was updated to support header-mode display list in continuous
pipelines.

A small bug in the status check of the command register causes the
second pipeline to be directly afflicted by the running of the first;
appearing as a perceived performance issue with stuttering display.

Fix the vsp1_dl_list_hw_update_pending() call to ensure that the read
comparison corresponds to the correct pipeline.
