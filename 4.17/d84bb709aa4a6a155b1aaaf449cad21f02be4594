signals, sparc: Add signal codes for ADI violations

SPARC M7 processor introduces a new feature - Application Data
Integrity (ADI). ADI allows MMU to  catch rogue accesses to memory.
When a rogue access occurs, MMU blocks the access and raises an
exception. In response to the exception, kernel sends the offending
task a SIGSEGV with si_code that indicates the nature of exception.
This patch adds three new signal codes specific to ADI feature:

1. ADI is not enabled for the address and task attempted to access
   memory using ADI
2. Task attempted to access memory using wrong ADI tag and caused
   a deferred exception.
3. Task attempted to access memory using wrong ADI tag and caused
   a precise exception.
