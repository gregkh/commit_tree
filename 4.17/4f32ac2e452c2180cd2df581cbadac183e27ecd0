IB/mlx5: Use unlimited rate when static rate is not supported

Before the change, if the user passed a static rate value different
than zero and the FW doesn't support static rate,
it would end up configuring rate of 2.5 GBps.

Fix this by using rate 0; unlimited, in cases where FW
doesn't support static rate configuration.
