gcc-plugins: fix build condition of SANCOV plugin

Since commit d677a4d60193 ("Makefile: support flag
-fsanitizer-coverage=trace-cmp"), you miss to build the SANCOV
plugin under some circumstances.

  CONFIG_KCOV=y
  CONFIG_KCOV_ENABLE_COMPARISONS=y
  Your compiler does not support -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc
  Your compiler does not support -fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp

Under this condition, $(CFLAGS_KCOV) is not empty but contains a
space, so the following ifeq-conditional is false.

    ifeq ($(CFLAGS_KCOV),)

Then, scripts/Makefile.gcc-plugins misses to add sancov_plugin.so to
gcc-plugin-y while the SANCOV plugin is necessary as an alternative
means.
