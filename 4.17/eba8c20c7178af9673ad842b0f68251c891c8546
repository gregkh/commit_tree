scsi: hisi_sas: fix the issue of link rate inconsistency

In sysfs, there are two files about minimum linkrate, and also two files for
maximum linkrate. Take maximum linkrate example, maximum_linkrate_hw is
read-only and indicated by the register HARD_PHY_LINKRATE, and
maximum_linkrate is read-write and corresponding to the register
PROG_PHY_LINK_RATE.

But in the function phy_up_v*_hw(), we get *_linkrate value from
HARD_PHY_LINKRATE. It is not right. This patch is to fix this issue.

Unreferenced PHY-interrupt enum is also removed for v3 hw.
