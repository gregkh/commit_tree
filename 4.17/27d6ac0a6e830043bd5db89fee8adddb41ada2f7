scsi: lpfc: Add SLI-4 if_type=6 support to the code base

New hardware supports a SLI-4 interface, but with a new if_type
variant of 6.

If_type=6 has a different PCI BAR map, separate EQ/CQ doorbells,
and some changes in doorbell formats.

Add the changes for the if_type into headers, adapter initialization
and control flows. Add new eq and cq handlers.
