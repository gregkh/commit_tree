staging: lustre: replace all CFS_CAP_* macros with CAP_*

Lustre defines a few CFS_CAP_* macros which are exactly the
same as the corresponding CAP_* macro, with one exception.

CFS_CAP_SYS_BOOT is 23
CAP_SYS_BOOT is 22.

CFS_CAP_SYS_BOOT is only used through CFS_CAP_FS_MASK and
causes capability 23 (CAP_SYS_NICE) to be dropped in certain
circumstances.
It is probable that the intention was to drop CAP_SYS_BOOT,
and this is what is now done.

CFS_CAP_CHOWN_MASK and CFS_CAP_SYS_RESOURCE_MASK are never
used, so they have been removed.
