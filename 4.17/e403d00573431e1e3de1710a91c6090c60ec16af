clk: tegra: MBIST work around for Tegra210

Tegra210 has a hw bug which can cause IP blocks to lock up when ungating a
domain. The reason is that the logic responsible for resetting the memory
built-in self test mode can come up in an undefined state because its
clock is gated by a second level clock gate (SLCG). Work around this by
making sure the logic will get some clock edges by ensuring the relevant
clock is enabled and temporarily override the relevant SLCGs.
Unfortunately for some IP blocks, the control bits for overriding the
SLCGs are not in CAR, but in the IP block itself. This means we need to
map a few extra register banks in the clock code.
