PCI: endpoint: Setting 64-bit/prefetch bit is invalid when IO is set

If flag PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_SPACE_IO is set, also having any
PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_* bit set is invalid.

This sanity check is done in pci_epc_set_bar(), so that we don't need
to do this sanity check in all epc->ops->set_bar() implementations.
