audit: do not panic on invalid boot parameter

If you pass in an invalid audit boot parameter value, e.g. "audit=off",
the kernel panics very early in boot before the regular console is
initialized.  Unless you have earlyprintk enabled, there is no
indication of what the problem is on the console.

Convert the panic() calls to pr_err(), and leave auditing enabled if an
invalid parameter value was passed in.

Modify the parameter to also accept "on" or "off" as valid values, and
update the documentation accordingly.
