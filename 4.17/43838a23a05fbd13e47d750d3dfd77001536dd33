random: fix crng_ready() test

The crng_init variable has three states:

0: The CRNG is not initialized at all
1: The CRNG has a small amount of entropy, hopefully good enough for
   early-boot, non-cryptographical use cases
2: The CRNG is fully initialized and we are sure it is safe for
   cryptographic use cases.

The crng_ready() function should only return true once we are in the
last state.  This addresses CVE-2018-1108.
