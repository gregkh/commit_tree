net/ipv4: Simplify fib_multipath_hash with optional flow keys

As of commit e37b1e978bec5 ("ipv6: route: dissect flow in input path if
fib rules need it") fib_multipath_hash takes an optional flow keys. If
non-NULL it means the skb has already been dissected. If not set, then
fib_multipath_hash needs to call skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys.

Simplify the logic by setting flkeys to the local stack variable keys.
Simplifies fib_multipath_hash by only have 1 set of instructions
setting hash_keys.
