Input: atmel_mxt_ts - add missing compatible strings to OF device table

Commit af503716ac14 ("i2c: core: report OF style module alias for devices
registered via OF") fixed how the I2C core reports the module alias when
devices are registered via OF.

But the atmel_mxt_ts driver only has an "atmel,maxtouch" compatible in its
OF device ID table, so if a Device Tree is using a different one, autoload
won't be working for the module (the matching works because the I2C device
ID table is used as a fallback).

So add compatible strings for each of the entries in the I2C device table.
