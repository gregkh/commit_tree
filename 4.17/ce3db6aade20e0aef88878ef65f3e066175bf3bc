enic: drop IP proto check for vxlan tunnel delete

Commit d11790941dd3 ("enic: Add vxlan offload support for IPv6 pkts")
added vxlan offload support for IPv6 pkts. Required change in
enic_udp_tunnel_del was not made. This creates a bug where once user
adds IPv6 tunnel, hw offload for that cannot be deleted.

This patch removes check for IP proto in tunnel delete path. Driver need
not check for IP proto since same UDP port cannot be used to create two
tunnels.
