rxrpc, afs: Use debug_ids rather than pointers in traces

In rxrpc and afs, use the debug_ids that are monotonically allocated to
various objects as they're allocated rather than pointers as kernel
pointers are now hashed making them less useful.  Further, the debug ids
aren't reused anywhere nearly as quickly.

In addition, allow kernel services that use rxrpc, such as afs, to take
numbers from the rxrpc counter, assign them to their own call struct and
pass them in to rxrpc for both client and service calls so that the trace
lines for each will have the same ID tag.
