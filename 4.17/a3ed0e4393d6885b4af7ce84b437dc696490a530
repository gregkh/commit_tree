As stated in the pull request for the unification of CLOCK_MONOTONIC and
CLOCK_BOOTTIME, it was clear that we might have to revert the change.

As reported by several folks systemd and other applications rely on the
documented behaviour of CLOCK_MONOTONIC on Linux and break with the above
changes. After resume daemons time out and other timeout related issues are
observed. Rafael compiled this list:

* systemd kills daemons on resume, after >WatchdogSec seconds
  of suspending (Genki Sky).  [Verified that that's because systemd uses
  CLOCK_MONOTONIC and expects it to not include the suspend time.]

* systemd-journald misbehaves after resume:
  systemd-journald[7266]: File /var/log/journal/016627c3c4784cd4812d4b7e96a34226/system.journal
corrupted or uncleanly shut down, renaming and replacing.
  (Mike Galbraith).

* NetworkManager reports "networking disabled" and networking is broken
  after resume 50% of the time (Pavel).  [May be because of systemd.]

* MATE desktop dims the display and starts the screensaver right after
  system resume (Pavel).

* Full system hang during resume (me).  [May be due to systemd or NM or both.]

That happens on debian and open suse systems.

It's sad, that these problems were neither catched in -next nor by those
folks who expressed interest in this change.
