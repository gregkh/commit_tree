cpuidle: menu: Refine idle state selection for running tick

If the tick isn't stopped, the target residency of the state selected
by the menu governor may be greater than the actual time to the next
tick and that means lost energy.

To avoid that, make tick_nohz_get_sleep_length() return the current
time to the next event (before stopping the tick) in addition to the
estimated one via an extra pointer argument and make menu_select()
use that value to refine the state selection when necessary.
