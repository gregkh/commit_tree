ARM: shmobile: defconfig: Disable CONFIG_EMBEDDED

CONFIG_EXPERT exposes too many config options that do not matter for
development.  E.g. it prohibits using the default values for the various
SH_SCI options.  However, CONFIG_EMBEDDED selects CONFIG_EXPERT, so it
cannot be disabled.

Hence disable CONFIG_EMBEDDED, and compensate for the loss of
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL by enabling the latter.

Actual impact, all harmless:
  - CONFIG_NAMESPACES=y (plus a few related CONFIG_*_NS options),
  - CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL=n,
  - CONFIG_SERIAL_SH_SCI_NR_UARTS changed from 20 to 18,
  - Some HID support became enabled,
  - CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMORY_INIT=y,

Refresh the result.
