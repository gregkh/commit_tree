x86/mm: Align TLB invalidation info

The TLB invalidation info is allocated on the stack, which might cause
it to be unaligned. Since this information may be transferred to
different cores for TLB shootdown, this may cause an additional cache
line to become shared. While the overhead is likely to be small, the
fix is simple.

We do not use __cacheline_aligned() since it also defines the section,
which is inappropriate for stack variables.
