x86: kexec_file: lift CRASH_MAX_RANGES limit on crash_mem buffer

While CRASH_MAX_RANGES (== 16) seems to be good enough, fixed-number
array is not a good idea in general.

In this patch, size of crash_mem buffer is calculated as before and the
buffer is now dynamically allocated.  This change also allows removing
crash_elf_data structure.
