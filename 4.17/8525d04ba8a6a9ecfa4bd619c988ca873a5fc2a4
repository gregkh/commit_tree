drm: rcar-du: lvds: Fix LVDS startup on R-Car Gen2

According to the latest revision 2.00 of the R-Car Gen2 manual, the LVDS
and the bias circuit must be enabled after the LVDS I/O pins are
enabled, not before. Fix the Gen2 LVDS startup sequence accordingly.

While at it, also fix the comment preceding the first LVDCR0 write that
still talks about hardcoding the LVDS mode 0.
