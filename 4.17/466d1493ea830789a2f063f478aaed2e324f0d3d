acpi, nfit: rework NVDIMM leaf method detection

Some BIOSen do not handle 0-byte transfer lengths for the _LSR and _LSW
(label storage read/write) methods. This causes Linux to fallback to the
deprecated _DSM path, or otherwise disable label support.

Introduce acpi_nvdimm_has_method() to detect whether a method is
available rather than calling the method, require _LSI and _LSR to be
paired, and require read support before enabling write support.
