nfit, address-range-scrub: fix scrub in-progress reporting

There is a small window whereby ARS scan requests can schedule work that
userspace will miss when polling scrub_show. Hold the init_mutex lock
over calls to report the status to close this potential escape. Also,
make sure that requests to cancel the ARS workqueue are treated as an
idle event.
