Revert "drm/atomic: Fix memleak on ERESTARTSYS during non-blocking commits"

This reverts commit a10195bbe7f4e6ba540083ba13126ef745116cae.

This commit needs some more thought, and is currently crashing kms_flip
tests. Until we figure out what's going wrong it's better to revert, and
also next time apply it to drm-misc-fixes.

Testcase: kms_flip
