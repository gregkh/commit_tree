ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Add support for Bay Trail CR / SSP0 using boards

Despite its name being prefixed with bytcr, before this commit the
bytcr_rt5651 machine driver could not work with Bay Trail CR boards,
as those only have SSP0 and it only supported SSP0-AIF1 setups.

This commit adds support for this, autodetecting AIF1 vs AIF2 based on
BIOS tables.

While at it also add support for SSP2-AIF2 setups, as that requires only
minimal extra code on top of the code adding SSP0-AIF1 / SSP0-AIF2 support.

Note this code is all copy-pasted from bytcr_rt5640.c. I've looked into
merging the 2 machine drivers into 1 to avoid copy-pasting, but there are
enough subtile differences to make this hard *and* with all the quirks the
machine driver already is full with if (variant-foo) then ... else ...
constructs adding more of these is going to make the code unreadable.
