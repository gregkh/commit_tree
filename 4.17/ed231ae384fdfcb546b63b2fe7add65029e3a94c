arm64/kernel: rename module_emit_adrp_veneer->module_emit_veneer_for_adrp

Commit a257e02579e ("arm64/kernel: don't ban ADRP to work around
Cortex-A53 erratum #843419") introduced a function whose name ends with
"_veneer".

This clashes with commit bd8b22d2888e ("Kbuild: kallsyms: ignore veneers
emitted by the ARM linker"), which removes symbols ending in "_veneer"
from kallsyms.

The problem was manifested as 'perf test -vvvvv vmlinux' failed,
correctly claiming the symbol 'module_emit_adrp_veneer' was present in
vmlinux, but not in kallsyms.

...
    ERR : 0xffff00000809aa58: module_emit_adrp_veneer not on kallsyms
...
    test child finished with -1
    ---- end ----
    vmlinux symtab matches kallsyms: FAILED!

Fix the problem by renaming module_emit_adrp_veneer to
module_emit_veneer_for_adrp.  Now the test passes.
