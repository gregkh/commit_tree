i40e: move client flags into state bits

The iWarp client flags are all potentially changed when the RTNL lock is
not held, so they should not be part of the pf->flags variable. Instead,
move them into the state field so that we can use atomic bit operations.

This is part of a larger effort to remove cmpxchg64 in
i40e_set_priv_flags()
