usb: typec: API for controlling USB Type-C Multiplexers

USB Type-C connectors consist of various muxes and switches
that route the pins on the connector to the right locations.
The USB Type-C drivers need to be able to control the muxes,
as they are the ones that know things like the cable plug
orientation, and the current mode that was negotiated with
the partner.

This introduces a small API for registering and controlling
cable plug orientation switches, and separate small API for
registering and controlling pin multiplexer/demultiplexer
switches that are needed with Accessory/Alternate Modes.
