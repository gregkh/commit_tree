ARM: dts: STi: Fix bindings notation

Remove leading 0x and 0s from bindings notation
Add missing unit-address and remove some which are useless.

This allows to fix several warnings like :

Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node XXXX has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name
Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node XXXX simple-bus unit address format error, expected "123456"
Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node XXXX has a unit name, but no reg property
