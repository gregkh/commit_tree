ASoC: fsl_ssi: Move DT related code to a separate probe()

This patch cleans up probe() function by moving all Device Tree
related code into a separate function. It allows the probe() to
be Device Tree independent. This will be very useful for future
integration of imx-ssi driver which has similar functionalities
while exists only because it supports non-DT cases.

This patch also moves symmetric_channels of AC97 from the probe
to the structure snd_soc_dai_driver for simplification.

Additionally, since PowerPC and AC97 use the same pdev pointer
to register a platform device, this patch also unifies related
code.
