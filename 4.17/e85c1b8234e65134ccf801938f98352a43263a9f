i40evf: pass struct virtchnl_filter by reference rather than by value

Passing struct virtchnl_filter f by value requires a 272 byte copy
on x86_64, so instead pass it by reference is much more efficient. Also
adjust some lines that are over 80 chars.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1465285 ("Big parameter passed by value")
