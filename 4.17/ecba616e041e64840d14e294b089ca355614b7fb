ibmvnic: Fix TX descriptor tracking again

Sorry, the previous change introduced a race condition between
transmit completion processing and tracking TX descriptors. If a
completion is received before the number of descriptors is logged,
the number of descriptors will be add but not removed. After enough
times, this could halt the transmit queue forever.

Log the number of descriptors used by a transmit before sending.
I stress tested the fix on two different systems running over the
weekend without any issues.
