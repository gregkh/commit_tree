net: hns3: fix for coalesce configuration lost during reset

Coalesce configuration will be set to default value by
hns3_nic_init_vector_data during reset, which causes the
coalesce configuration loss problem.

This patch fixes it by setting the default value in
hns3_nic_alloc_vector_data, which will not be called in the
reset process.
