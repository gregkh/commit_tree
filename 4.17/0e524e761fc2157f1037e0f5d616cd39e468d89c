powerpc: Clear branch trap (MSR.BE) before delivering SIGTRAP

When using SIG_DBG_BRANCH_TRACING, MSR.BE is left enabled in the
user context when single_step_exception() prepares the SIGTRAP
delivery.  The resulting branch-trap-within-the-SIGTRAP-handler
isn't healthy.

Commit 2538c2d08f46141550a1e68819efa8fe31c6e3dc broke this, by
replacing an MSR mask operation of ~(MSR_SE | MSR_BE) with a call
to clear_single_step() which only clears MSR_SE.

This patch adds a new helper, clear_br_trace(), which clears the
debug trap before invoking the signal handler.  This helper is a
NOP for BookE as SIG_DBG_BRANCH_TRACING isn't supported on BookE.
