crypto: arm,arm64 - Fix random regeneration of S_shipped

The decision to rebuild .S_shipped is made based on the relative
timestamps of .S_shipped and .pl files but git makes this essentially
random. This means that the perl script might run anyway (usually at
most once per checkout), defeating the whole purpose of _shipped.

Fix by skipping the rule unless explicit make variables are provided:
REGENERATE_ARM_CRYPTO or REGENERATE_ARM64_CRYPTO.

This can produce nasty occasional build failures downstream, for example
for toolchains with broken perl. The solution is minimally intrusive to
make it easier to push into stable.
