exec: pin stack limit during exec

Since the stack rlimit is used in multiple places during exec and it can
be changed via other threads (via setrlimit()) or processes (via
prlimit()), the assumption that the value doesn't change cannot be made.
This leads to races with mm layout selection and argument size
calculations.  This changes the exec path to use the rlimit stored in
bprm instead of in current.  Before starting the thread, the bprm stack
rlimit is stored back to current.
