arm64: dts: hisi: Disable hisilicon smmu node on hip06/hip07

The HiSilicon erratum 161010801 describes the limitation of
HiSilicon platforms hip06/hip07 to support the SMMUv3 mappings
for MSI transactions.

PCIe controller on these platforms has to differentiate the
MSI payload against other DMA payload and has to modify the
MSI  payload. This makes it difficult for these platforms to
have SMMU translation for MSI. In order to workaround this,
ARM SMMUv3 driver requires a quirk to treat the MSI regions
separately. Such a quirk is currently missing for DT based
systems and therefore we need to explicitly disable the
hip06/hip07 smmu entries in dts.
