kconfig: extend output of 'listnewconfig'

We at Red Hat/Fedora have generally tried to have a per file breakdown of
every config option we set.  This makes it easy for us to add new options
when they are exposed and keep a changelog of why they were set.

A Fedora example is here:
  https://src.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/kernel.git/tree/configs/fedora/generic

Using various merge scripts, we build up a config file and run it through
'make listnewconfig' and 'make oldnoconfig'.   The idea is to print out new
config options that haven't been manually set and use the default until
a patch is posted to set it properly.

To speed things up, it would be nice to make it easier to generate a
patch to post the default setting.  The output of 'make listnewconfig'
has two issues that limit us:

- it doesn't provide the default value
- it doesn't provide the new 'choice' options that get flagged in
  'oldconfig'

This patch extends 'listnewconfig' to address the above two issues.

This allows us to run a script

make listnewconfig | rhconfig-tool -o patches; git send-email patches/

The output of 'make listnewconfig':

CONFIG_NET_EMATCH_IPT
CONFIG_IPVLAN
CONFIG_ICE
CONFIG_NET_VENDOR_NI
CONFIG_IEEE802154_MCR20A
CONFIG_IR_IMON_DECODER
CONFIG_IR_IMON_RAW

The new output of 'make listnewconfig':

CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ=n
CONFIG_KERNEL_LZO=n
CONFIG_NET_EMATCH_IPT=n
CONFIG_IPVLAN=n
CONFIG_ICE=n
CONFIG_NET_VENDOR_NI=y
CONFIG_IEEE802154_MCR20A=n
CONFIG_IR_IMON_DECODER=n
CONFIG_IR_IMON_RAW=n
