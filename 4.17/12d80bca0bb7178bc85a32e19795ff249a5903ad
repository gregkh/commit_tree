i40e: Fix the polling mechanism of GLGEN_RSTAT.DEVSTATE

This fixes the polling mechanism of GLGEN_RSTAT.DEVSTATE in the
PF Reset path when Global Reset is in progress. While the driver
is polling for the end of the PF Reset and the Global Reset is
triggered, abandon the PF Reset path and prepare for the
upcoming Global Reset.
