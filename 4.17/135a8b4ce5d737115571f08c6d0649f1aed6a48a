s390/cio: fix unbind of io_subchannel_driver

If the io_subchannel_driver is unbound from a subchannel it bluntly kills
all I/O on the subchannel and sets the ccw_device state to not operable
before deregistering the ccw_device. However, for online devices we should
set the device offline (disband path groups etc.) which does not happen if
the device is in not oper state.

Simply deregister the ccw device - ccw_device_remove is smart enough to set
the device offline properly. If everything fails call io_subchannel_quiesce
afterwards as a safeguard.
