inet: frags: do not clone skb in ip_expire()

An skb_clone() was added in commit ec4fbd64751d ("inet: frag: release
spinlock before calling icmp_send()")

While fixing the bug at that time, it also added a very high cost
for DDOS frags, as the ICMP rate limit is applied after this
expensive operation (skb_clone() + consume_skb(), implying memory
allocations, copy, and freeing)

We can use skb_get(head) here, all we want is to make sure skb wont
be freed by another cpu.
