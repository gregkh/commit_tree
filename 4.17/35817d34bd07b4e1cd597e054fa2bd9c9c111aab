pinctrl: sunxi: change irq_bank_base to irq_bank_map

The Allwinner H6 SoC have its pin controllers with the first IRQ-capable
GPIO bank at IRQ bank 1 and the second bank at IRQ bank 5.

Change the current code that uses IRQ bank base to a IRQ bank map, in
order to support the case that holes exist among IRQ banks.
