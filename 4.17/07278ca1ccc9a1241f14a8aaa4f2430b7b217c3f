watchdog: renesas_wdt: Add suspend/resume support

On R-Car Gen2 and RZ/G1 the watchdog IP clock needs to be always ON,
on R-Car Gen3 we power the IP down during suspend.

This commit adds suspend/resume support, so that the watchdog counting
"pauses" during suspend on all of the SoCs compatible with this driver
and on those we are now adding support for (R-Car Gen2 and RZ/G1).
