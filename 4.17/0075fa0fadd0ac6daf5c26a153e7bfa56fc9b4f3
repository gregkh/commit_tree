i40evf: Add support to apply cloud filters

This patch enables a tc filter to be applied as a cloud
filter for the VF. This patch adds functions which parse the
tc filter, extract the necessary fields needed to configure the
filter and package them in a virtchnl message to be sent to the
PF to apply them.
