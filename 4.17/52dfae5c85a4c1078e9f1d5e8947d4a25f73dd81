tipc: obtain node identity from interface by default

Selecting and explicitly configuring a TIPC node identity may be
unwanted in some cases.

In this commit we introduce a default setting if the identity has not
been set at the moment the first bearer is enabled. We do this by
using a raw copy of a unique identifier from the used interface: MAC
address in the case of an L2 bearer, IPv4/IPv6 address in the case
of a UDP bearer.
