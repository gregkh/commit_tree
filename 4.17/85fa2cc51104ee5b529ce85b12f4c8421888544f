c6x: pass endianness info to sparse

c6x depends on the macro '_BIG_ENDIAN' being defined or not
to correctly select or define endian-specific macros, structures
or pieces of code.

This macro is predefined by the compiler but sparse knows nothing
about it and thus may pre-process files differently from what
gcc would.

Fix this by passing '-D_BIG_ENDIAN' when compiling a big-endian
kernel, like GCC would have done.
