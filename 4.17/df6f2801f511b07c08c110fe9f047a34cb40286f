kernel/kexec_file.c: move purgatories sha256 to common code

The code to verify the new kernels sha digest is applicable for all
architectures.  Move it to common code.

One problem is the string.c implementation on x86.  Currently sha256
includes x86/boot/string.h which defines memcpy and memset to be gcc
builtins.  By moving the sha256 implementation to common code and
changing the include to linux/string.h both functions are no longer
defined.  Thus definitions have to be provided in x86/purgatory/string.c
