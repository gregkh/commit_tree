crypto: aesni - Introduce partial block macro

Before this diff, multiple calls to GCM_ENC_DEC will
succeed, but only if all calls are a multiple of 16 bytes.

Handle partial blocks at the start of GCM_ENC_DEC, and update
aadhash as appropriate.

The data offset %r11 is also updated after the partial block.
