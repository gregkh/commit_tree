usb: dwc2: gadget: Fix dwc2_restore_device_registers

Add parameter remote_wakeup to dwc2_restore_device_registers()
to be able to restore device registers according to programming
guide for dwc-otg. It says that in case of rem_wakeup DCTL must not
be restored here.

Remove setting of DCTL_PWRONPRGDONE from this function, because it
will be done in function responsible for exiting from hibernation.

WA for enabled EPx's IN and OUT in DDMA mode. On entering to
hibernation wrong value read and saved from DIEPDMAx,
as result BNA interrupt asserted on hibernation exit
by restoring from saved area.
