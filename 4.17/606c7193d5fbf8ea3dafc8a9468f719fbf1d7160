x86/mm: Undo double _PAGE_PSE clearing

When clearing _PAGE_PRESENT on a huge page, we need to be careful
to also clear _PAGE_PSE, otherwise it might still get confused
for a valid large page table entry.

We do that near the spot where we *set* _PAGE_PSE.  That's fine,
but it's unnecessary.  pgprot_large_2_4k() already did it.

BTW, I also noticed that pgprot_large_2_4k() and
pgprot_4k_2_large() are not symmetric.  pgprot_large_2_4k() clears
_PAGE_PSE (because it is aliased to _PAGE_PAT) but
pgprot_4k_2_large() does not put _PAGE_PSE back.  Bummer.

Also, add some comments and change "promote" to "move".  "Promote"
seems an odd word to move when we are logically moving a bit to a
lower bit position.  Also add an extra line return to make it clear
to which line the comment applies.
