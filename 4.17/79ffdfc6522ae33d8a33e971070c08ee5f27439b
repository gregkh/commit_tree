net: Add rtnl_lock_killable()

rtnl_lock() is widely used mutex in kernel. Some of kernel code
does memory allocations under it. In case of memory deficit this
may invoke OOM killer, but the problem is a killed task can't
exit if it's waiting for the mutex. This may be a reason of deadlock
and panic.

This patch adds a new primitive, which responds on SIGKILL, and
it allows to use it in the places, where we don't want to sleep
forever.
