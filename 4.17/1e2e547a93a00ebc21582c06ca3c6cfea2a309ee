do d_instantiate/unlock_new_inode combinations safely

For anything NFS-exported we do _not_ want to unlock new inode
before it has grown an alias; original set of fixes got the
ordering right, but missed the nasty complication in case of
lockdep being enabled - unlock_new_inode() does
	lockdep_annotate_inode_mutex_key(inode)
which can only be done before anyone gets a chance to touch
->i_mutex.  Unfortunately, flipping the order and doing
unlock_new_inode() before d_instantiate() opens a window when
mkdir can race with open-by-fhandle on a guessed fhandle, leading
to multiple aliases for a directory inode and all the breakage
that follows from that.

	Correct solution: a new primitive (d_instantiate_new())
combining these two in the right order - lockdep annotate, then
d_instantiate(), then the rest of unlock_new_inode().  All
combinations of d_instantiate() with unlock_new_inode() should
be converted to that.
