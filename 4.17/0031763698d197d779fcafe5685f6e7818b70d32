afs: Adjust the directory XDR structures

Adjust the AFS directory XDR structures in a number of superficial ways:

 (1) Rename them to all begin afs_xdr_.

 (2) Use u8 instead of uint8_t.

 (3) Mark the structures as __packed so they don't get rearranged by the
     compiler.

 (4) Rename the hdr member of afs_xdr_dir_block to meta.

 (5) Rename the pagehdr member of afs_xdr_dir_block to hdr.
