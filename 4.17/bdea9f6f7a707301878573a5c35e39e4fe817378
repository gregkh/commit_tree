s390/Kconfig: Move kexec config options to "Processor type and features"

The config options for kexec are currently not under any menu directory. Up
until now this was not a problem as standard kexec is always compiled in
and thus does not create a menu entry. This changed when kexec_file_load
was enabled. Its config option requires a menu entry which, when added
beneath standard kexec option, appears on the main directory above "General
Setup". Thus move the whole block further down such that the entry in now
in "Processor type and features".

While at it also update the help text for kexec file.
