perf intel-pt: Fix error recovery from missing TIP packet

When a TIP packet is expected but there is a different packet, it is an
error. However the unexpected packet might be something important like a
TSC packet, so after the error, it is necessary to continue from there,
rather than the next packet. That is achieved by setting pkt_step to
zero.
