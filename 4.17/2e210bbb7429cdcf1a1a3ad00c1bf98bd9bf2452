HID: input: fix battery level reporting on BT mice

The commit 581c4484769e ("HID: input: map digitizer battery usage")
assumed that devices having input (qas opposed to feature) report for
battery strength would report the data on their own, without the need to
be polled by the kernel; unfortunately it is not so. Many wireless mice
do not send unsolicited reports with battery strength data and have to
be polled explicitly. As a complication, stylus devices on digitizers
are not normally connected to the base and thus can not be polled - the
base can only determine battery strength in the stylus when it is in
proximity.

To solve this issue, we add a special flag that tells the kernel
to avoid polling the device (and expect unsolicited reports) and set it
when report field with physical usage of digitizer stylus (HID_DG_STYLUS).
Unless this flag is set, and we have not seen the unsolicited reports,
the kernel will attempt to poll the device when userspace attempts to
read "capacity" and "state" attributes of power_supply object
corresponding to the devices battery.
