crypto: drbg - set freed buffers to NULL

During freeing of the internal buffers used by the DRBG, set the pointer
to NULL. It is possible that the context with the freed buffers is
reused. In case of an error during initialization where the pointers
do not yet point to allocated memory, the NULL value prevents a double
free.
