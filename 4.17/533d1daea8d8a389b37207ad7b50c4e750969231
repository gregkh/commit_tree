IB: Revert "remove redundant INFINIBAND kconfig dependencies"

Several subsystems depend on INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS, which in turn depends
on INFINIBAND. However, when with CONFIG_INIFIBAND=m, this leads to a
link error when another driver using it is built-in. The
INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS dependency is insufficient here as this is
a 'bool' symbol that does not force anything to be a module in turn.
