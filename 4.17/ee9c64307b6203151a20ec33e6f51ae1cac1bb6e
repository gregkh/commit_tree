Revert "dt-bindings: ifc: Fix the unit address format in the examples"

This reverts commit 4e017f1419397473cf3db6e9fa020013998b1aa4.

As explained by Rob Herring:

"This "fix" is wrong. Memory controllers with chip selects should have
the chip select in the unit-address. The correct fix here is you should drop
"simple-bus"."
