leaking_addresses: use system command to get arch

Currently script uses Perl to get the machine architecture. This can be
erroneous since Perl uses the architecture of the machine that Perl was
compiled on not the architecture of the running machine. We should use
the systems `uname` command instead.

Use `uname -m` instead of Perl to get the machine architecture.
