vhost_net: flush batched heads before trying to busy polling

After commit e2b3b35eb989 ("vhost_net: batch used ring update in rx"),
we tend to batch updating used heads. But it doesn't flush batched
heads before trying to do busy polling, this will cause vhost to wait
for guest TX which waits for the used RX. Fixing by flush batched
heads before busy loop.

1 byte TCP_RR performance recovers from 13107.83 to 50402.65.
