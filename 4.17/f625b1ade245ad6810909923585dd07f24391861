PCI: qcom: Add missing supplies required for msm8996

This patch adds supplies that are required for msm8996. vdda
is analog supply that go in to controller, and vddpe_3v3 is
supply to PCIe endpoint.

Without these supplies PCIe endpoints which require power supplies are
not enumerated at all, as there is no one to power it up.
