mm/hmm: use uint64_t for HMM pfn instead of defining hmm_pfn_t to ulong

All device driver we care about are using 64bits page table entry.  In
order to match this and to avoid useless define convert all HMM pfn to
directly use uint64_t.  It is a first step on the road to allow driver to
directly use pfn value return by HMM (saving memory and CPU cycles use for
conversion between the two).
