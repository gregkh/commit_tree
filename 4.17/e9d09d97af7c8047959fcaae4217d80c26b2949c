i2c: scmi: Use standard device message logging functions

ACPI_ERROR and ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT are not intended to be used by device
drivers. Use acpi_handle message logging functions instead.

As a nice side effect, it removes the following compiler warnings
which were printed when ACPI debug is disabled:

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-scmi.c: In function "acpi_smbus_cmi_add_cap":
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-scmi.c:328:39: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an "else" statement [-Wempty-body]
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-scmi.c:338:12: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an "else" statement [-Wempty-body]
