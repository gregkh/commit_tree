ASoC: Revert "ASoC: soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm: Fix error handling"

This reverts commit f91b1e73ccde71d4bc69ae10d475196df38844ab.

As explained by Lars-Peter Clausen:

"This creates a resource leak. dmaengine_pcm_request_chan_of() requests
bothtransmit and receive channels. It might return with an error if one
of them fails, but the other one succeeded. In this case we need to call
dmaengine_pcm_release_chan() to free the requested channel"

So revert the commit.
