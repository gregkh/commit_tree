get rid of trylock loop around dentry_kill()

In case when trylock in there fails, deal with it directly in
dentry_kill().  Note that in cases when we drop and retake
->d_lock, we need to recheck whether to retain the dentry.
Another thing is that dropping/retaking ->d_lock might have
ended up with negative dentry turning into positive; that,
of course, can happen only once...
