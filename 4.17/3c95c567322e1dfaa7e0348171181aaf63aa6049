net: qla3xxx: Eliminate duplicate barriers on weakly-ordered archs

Code includes wmb() followed by writel(). writel() already has a
barrier on some architectures like arm64.

This ends up CPU observing two barriers back to back before executing
the register write.

Since code already has an explicit barrier call, changing code to

wmb()
writel_relaxed()
mmiowb()

for multi-arch support.
