drm/edid: Reset more of the display info

We're currently failing to reset everything in display_info.hdmi
which will potentially cause us to use stale information when
swapping monitors. Eg. if the user replaces a HDMI 2.0 monitor
with a HDMI 1.x monitor we will continue to think that the monitor
supports scrambling. That will lead to a black screen since the
HDMI 1.x monitor won't understand the scrambled signal.

Fix the problem by clearing display_info.hdmi fully. And while at
eliminate some duplicated code by calling drm_reset_display_info()
in drm_add_display_info().
