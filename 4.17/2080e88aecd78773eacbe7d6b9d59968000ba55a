dax: introduce CONFIG_DAX_DRIVER

In support of allowing device-mapper to compile out idle/dead code when
there are no dax providers in the system, introduce the DAX_DRIVER
symbol. This is selected by all leaf drivers that device-mapper might be
layered on top. This allows device-mapper to conditionally 'select DAX'
only when a provider is present.
