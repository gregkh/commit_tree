perf annotate tui: Move have_cycles to struct annotation

This is to pave the way to have more functions shared between TUI, stdio
and the upcoming stdio2 formatting, that will use the __scnprintf
functions used by --tui in a --stdio fashion.

This partially addresses the comments added in cset 30e863bb6f70 ("perf
annotate: Compute IPC and basic block cycles"):

/*
 * This should probably be in util/annotate.c to share with the tty
 * annotate, but right now we need the per byte offsets arrays,
 * which are only here.
 */

The following patches will address the rest.
