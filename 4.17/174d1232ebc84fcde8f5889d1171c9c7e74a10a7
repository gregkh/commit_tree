gfs2: Fix fallocate chunk size

The chunk size of allocations in __gfs2_fallocate is calculated
incorrectly.  The size can collapse, causing __gfs2_fallocate to
allocate one block at a time, which is very inefficient.  This needs
fixing in two places:

In gfs2_quota_lock_check, always set ap->allowed to UINT_MAX to indicate
that there is no quota limit.  This fixes callers that rely on
ap->allowed to be set even when quotas are off.

In __gfs2_fallocate, reset max_blks to UINT_MAX in each iteration of the
loop to make sure that allocation limits from one resource group won't
spill over into another resource group.
