net: bcmgenet: Add support for adaptive RX coalescing

Unlike the moder modern SYSTEMPORT hardware, we do not have a
configurable TDMA timeout, which limits us to implement adaptive RX
interrupt coalescing only. We have each of our RX rings implement a
bcmgenet_net_dim structure which holds an interrupt counter, number of
packets, bytes, and a container for a net_dim instance.
