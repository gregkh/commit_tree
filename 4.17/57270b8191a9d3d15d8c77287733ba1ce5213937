drm/armada: Construct a temporary crtc state for plane checks

As armada isn't an atomic driver trying to pass a non-populated
crtc->state to drm_atomic_helper_check_plane_state() will end in tears.
Construct a temporary crtc state a la drm_plane_helper_check_update()
and pass that instead. For now we just really need crtc_state->enable
to be there.
