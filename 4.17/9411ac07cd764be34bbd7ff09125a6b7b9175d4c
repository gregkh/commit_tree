ARM: davinci: fix GPIO lookup for I2C

The GPIO chip is called davinci_gpio.0 in legacy mode. Fix it, so that
I2C can correctly lookup the recovery gpios.

Note that it is the gpio-davinci driver that sets the gpiochip label to
davinci_gpio.0.

Also, the I2C device uses an id of 1 on DM644x and DM355.

While at it, convert to using GPIO_TO_PIN() for referring to GPIO pin
numbers, like it is done in rest of the board support files.
