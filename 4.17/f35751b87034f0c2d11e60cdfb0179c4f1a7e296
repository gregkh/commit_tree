drm/amdkfd: Allocate CWSR trap handler memory for dGPUs

Add helpers for allocating GPUVM memory in kernel mode and use them
to allocate memory for the CWSR trap handler.

v2: Use dev instead of pdd->dev in kfd_process_free_gpuvm
v3:
* Cleaned up and simplified kfd_process_alloc_gpuvm
* Moved allocation for dGPU to kfd_process_device_init_vm
