net: hns3: fix for pause configuration lost during reset

Pause configuration will be set to default value by hclge_tm_schd_init
during reset, which causes the RSS configuration loss problem.

This patch fixes it by calling hclge_tm_init_hw during reset process
, which will set the pause configuration to default value.
