drm/i915/lrc: Update reg_state macros to pass checkpatch

The macros we use to init the reg_state had the following issues reported
by checkpatch --strict.

  Macro argument reuse 'reg_state' - possible side-effects
  Macro argument reuse 'pos' - possible side-effects
  Macro argument reuse 'ppgtt' - possible side-effects
  spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

So fix these issues before they are moved to a new header file.
