perf/x86/intel: Don't enable freeze-on-smi for PerfMon V1

The SMM freeze feature was introduced since PerfMon V2. But the current
code unconditionally enables the feature for all platforms. It can
generate #GP exception, if the related FREEZE_WHILE_SMM bit is set for
the machine with PerfMon V1.

To disable the feature for PerfMon V1, perf needs to
- Remove the freeze_on_smi sysfs entry by moving intel_pmu_attrs to
  intel_pmu, which is only applied to PerfMon V2 and later.
- Check the PerfMon version before flipping the SMM bit when starting CPU
