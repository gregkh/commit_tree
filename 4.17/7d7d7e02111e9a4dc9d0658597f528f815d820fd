netfilter: compat: reject huge allocation requests

no need to bother even trying to allocating huge compat offset arrays,
such ruleset is rejected later on anyway becaus we refuse to allocate
overly large rule blobs.

However, compat translation happens before blob allocation, so we should
add a check there too.

This is supposed to help with fuzzing by avoiding oom-killer.
