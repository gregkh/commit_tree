ibmvnic: Improve TX buffer accounting

Improve TX pool buffer accounting to prevent the producer
index from overruning the consumer. First, set the next free
index to an invalid value if it is in use. If next buffer
to be consumed is in use, drop the packet.

Finally, if the transmit fails for some other reason, roll
back the consumer index and set the free map entry to its original
value. This should also be done if the DMA map fails.
