fs: add do_lookup_dcookie() helper; remove in-kernel call to syscall

Using the fs-internal do_lookup_dcookie() helper allows us to get rid of
fs-internal calls to the sys_lookup_dcookie() syscall.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
