ALSA: hda - Fix runtime PM

Before commit 3b5b899ca67d ("ALSA: hda: Make use of core codec functions
to sync power state"), hda_set_power_state() returned the response to
the Get Power State verb, a 32-bit unsigned integer whose expected value
is 0x233 after transitioning a codec to D3, and 0x0 after transitioning
it to D0.

The response value is significant because hda_codec_runtime_suspend()
does not clear the codec's bit in the codec_powered bitmask unless the
AC_PWRST_CLK_STOP_OK bit (0x200) is set in the response value.  That in
turn prevents the HDA controller from runtime suspending because
azx_runtime_idle() checks that the codec_powered bitmask is zero.

Since commit 3b5b899ca67d, hda_set_power_state() only returns 0x0 or
0x1, thereby breaking runtime PM for any HDA controller.  That's because
an inline function introduced by the commit returns a bool instead of a
32-bit unsigned int.  The change was likely erroneous and resulted from
copying and pasting snd_hda_check_power_state(), which is immediately
preceding the newly introduced inline function.  Fix it.
