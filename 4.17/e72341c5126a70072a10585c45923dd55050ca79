KVM: arm/arm64: Introduce vcpu_el1_is_32bit

We have numerous checks around that checks if the HCR_EL2 has the RW bit
set to figure out if we're running an AArch64 or AArch32 VM.  In some
cases, directly checking the RW bit (given its unintuitive name), is a
bit confusing, and that's not going to improve as we move logic around
for the following patches that optimize KVM on AArch64 hosts with VHE.

Therefore, introduce a helper, vcpu_el1_is_32bit, and replace existing
direct checks of HCR_EL2.RW with the helper.
