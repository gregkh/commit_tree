perf tools: Do not create kernel maps in sample__resolve()

There's no need for kernel maps to be allocated at this point - sample
processing.

We search for kernel maps using the kernel map_groups in machine::kmaps
which is static. If vmlinux maps for any reason still don't exist, the
search correctly fails because they are not in the map group.
