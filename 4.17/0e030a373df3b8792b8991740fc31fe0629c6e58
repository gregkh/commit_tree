can: flexcan: fix endianess detection

In commit 88462d2a7830 ("can: flexcan: Remodel FlexCAN register r/w APIs
for big endian FlexCAN controllers.") the following logic was
implemented:

	if the dt property "big-endian" is given or
	   the device is compatible to "fsl,p1010-flexcan":
		use big-endian mode;
	else
		use little-endian mode;

This relies on commit d50f4630c2e1 ("arm: dts: Remove p1010-flexcan
compatible from imx series dts") which was applied a few commits later.
Without this commit (or an old device tree used for booting a new
kernel) the flexcan devices on i.MX25, i.MX28, i.MX35 and i.MX53 match
the 'the device is compatible to "fsl,p1010-flexcan"' test and so are
switched erroneously to big endian mode.

Instead of the check above put a quirk in devtype data and rely on
of_match_device yielding the most compatible match
