net/sched: fix refcnt leak in the error path of tcf_vlan_init()

Similarly to what was done with commit a52956dfc503 ("net sched actions:
fix refcnt leak in skbmod"), fix the error path of tcf_vlan_init() to avoid
refcnt leaks when wrong value of TCA_VLAN_PUSH_VLAN_PROTOCOL is given.

Fixes: 5026c9b1bafc ("net sched: vlan action fix late binding")
