drm/i915: Rename drm_i915_gem_request to i915_request

We want to de-emphasize the link between the request (dependency,
execution and fence tracking) from GEM and so rename the struct from
drm_i915_gem_request to i915_request. That is we may implement the GEM
user interface on top of requests, but they are an abstraction for
tracking execution rather than an implementation detail of GEM. (Since
they are not tied to HW, we keep the i915 prefix as opposed to intel.)

In short, the spatch:
@@

@@
- struct drm_i915_gem_request
+ struct i915_request

A corollary to contracting the type name, we also harmonise on using
'rq' shorthand for local variables where space if of the essence and
repetition makes 'request' unwieldy. For globals and struct members,
'request' is still much preferred for its clarity.
