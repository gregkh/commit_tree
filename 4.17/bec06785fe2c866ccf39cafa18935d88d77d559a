rcu: Remove obsolete boost statistics for debugfs

The debugfs interface displayed statistics on RCU priority boosting,
but this interface has since been removed.  This commit therefore
removes the no-longer-used rcu_data structure's ->n_tasks_boosted,
->n_exp_boosts, and ->n_exp_boosts and their updates.

If this information proves necessary in the future, the corresponding
event traces will be added.
