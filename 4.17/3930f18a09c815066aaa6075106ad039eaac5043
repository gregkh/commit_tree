drm/i915/tv: Cleanup up obsolete comments

The ages old kerneldoc-esque comments still refer to the original stubs
and not the more complete functions. As they were only describing the
external entry points (or at least thought themselves to be, they had
drifted!), they don't provide any commentary for the code flow.
