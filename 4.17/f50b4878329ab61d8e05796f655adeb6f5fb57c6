x86/pkeys/selftests: Fix pkey exhaustion test off-by-one

In our "exhaust all pkeys" test, we make sure that there
is the expected number available.  Turns out that the
test did not cover the execute-only key, but discussed
it anyway.  It did *not* discuss the test-allocated
key.

Now that we have a test for the mprotect(PROT_EXEC) case,
this off-by-one issue showed itself.  Correct the off-by-
one and add the explanation for the case we missed.
