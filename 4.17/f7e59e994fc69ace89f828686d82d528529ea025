scsi: qla2xxx: fix error message on <qla2400

This patch fixes IO traps caught by hardware when mailbox command fails
on qla2200. The error handler assumes newer firmware that is available
on 2400 and newer HBA-s.

This causes ugly crashes on sparc64.

Fix it with separate debug prints on different firmware generations like
most other places do.
