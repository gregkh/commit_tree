drm/sun4i: backend: Make sure we don't have a commit pending

If we try to read the backend registers while it fetches the new values, we
end up with the value of some random register instead of the one we asked
for.

In order to prevent that, let's make sure that the very first thing we do
during our atomic modesetting is to let the commit bit come to a rest.

We don't have to worry about anything else since the only time we will
trigger a new transaction is during the atomic_commit which comes much
later.
