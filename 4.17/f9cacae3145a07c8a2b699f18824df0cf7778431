btrfs: Move error handling of btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups closer to call site

Even though btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups is fairly in the beginning of
btrfs_commit_transaction outside of the critical section defined by the
transaction states it can only be run by a single comitter. In other
words it defines its own critical section thanks to the
BTRFS_TRANS_DIRTY_BG run flag and ro_block_group_mutex. However, its
error handling is outside of this critical section which is a bit
counter-intuitive. So move the error handling righ after the function is
executed and let the sole runner of dirty block groups handle the return
value. No functional changes.
