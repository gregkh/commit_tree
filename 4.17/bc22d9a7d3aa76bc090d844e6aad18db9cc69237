checkpatch: test SYMBOLIC_PERMS multiple times per line

There are occasions where symbolic perms are used in a ternary like

		return (channel == 0) ? S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR : S_IRUGO;

The current test will find the first use "S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR" but not the
second use "S_IRUGO" on the same line.

Improve the test to look for all instances on a line.
