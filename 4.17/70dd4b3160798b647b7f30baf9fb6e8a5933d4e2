kernel/sys_ni: sort cond_syscall() entries

Shuffle the cond_syscall() entries in kernel/sys_ni.c around so that they
are kept in the same order as in include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h. For
better structuring, add the same comments as in that file, but keep a few
additional comments and extend the commentary where it seems useful.
