gpiolib: Support 'gpio-reserved-ranges' property

Some qcom platforms make some GPIOs or pins unavailable for use by
non-secure operating systems, and thus reading or writing the registers
for those pins will cause access control issues. Add support for a DT
property to describe the set of GPIOs that are available for use so that
higher level OSes are able to know what pins to avoid reading/writing.
Non-DT platforms can add support by directly updating the
chip->valid_mask.
