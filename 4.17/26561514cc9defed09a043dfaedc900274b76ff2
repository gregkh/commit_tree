kconfig: do not include both curses.h and ncurses.h for nconfig

nconf.h includes <curses.h> and "ncurses.h", but it does not need to
include both.  Generally, it should fall back to curses.h only when
ncurses.h is not found.  But, looks like it has never happened;
these includes have been here for many years since commit 692d97c380c6
("kconfig: new configuration interface (nconfig)"), and nobody has
complained about hard-coding of ncurses.h .  Let's simply drop the
curses.h inclusion.

I replaced "ncurses.h" with <ncurses.h> since it is not a local file.
