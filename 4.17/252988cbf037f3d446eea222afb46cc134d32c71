powerpc: Don't write to DABR on >= Power8 if DAWR is disabled

flush_thread() calls __set_breakpoint() via set_debug_reg_defaults()
without checking ppc_breakpoint_available(). On Power8 or later CPUs
which have the DAWR feature disabled that will cause a write to the
DABR which is incorrect as those CPUs don't have a DABR.

Fix it two ways, by checking ppc_breakpoint_available() in
set_debug_reg_defaults(), and also by reworking __set_breakpoint() to
only write to DABR on Power7 or earlier.
