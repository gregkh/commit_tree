irqchip/gic: Take lock when updating irq type

Most MMIO GIC register accesses use a 1-hot bit scheme that
avoids requiring any form of locking. This isn't true for the
GICD_ICFGRn registers, which require a RMW sequence.

Unfortunately, we seem to be missing a lock for these particular
accesses, which could result in a race condition if changing the
trigger type on any two interrupts within the same set of 16
interrupts (and thus controlled by the same CFGR register).

Introduce a private lock in the GIC common comde for this
particular case, making it cover both GIC implementations
in one go.
