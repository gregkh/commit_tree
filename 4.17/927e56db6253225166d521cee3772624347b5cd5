ring-buffer: Add set/clear_current_oom_origin() during allocations

As si_mem_available() can say there is enough memory even though the memory
available is not useable by the ring buffer, it is best to not kill innocent
applications because the ring buffer is taking up all the memory while it is
trying to allocate a great deal of memory.

If the allocator is user space (because kernel threads can also increase the
size of the kernel ring buffer on boot up), then after si_mem_available()
says there is enough memory, set the OOM killer to kill the current task if
an OOM triggers during the allocation.
