dt-bindings: fsi: Add specification for FSI busses

This change introduces a proposed layout for describing FSI busses in
the device tree. While the bus is probe-able, we'd still like a method
of describing subordinate (eg i2c) busses that are behind FSI devices.

The FSI core will be responsible for matching probed slaves & engines to
their device tree nodes, so the FSI device drivers' probe() functions
will be passed a struct device with the appropriate of_node populated
where a matching DT node is found.
