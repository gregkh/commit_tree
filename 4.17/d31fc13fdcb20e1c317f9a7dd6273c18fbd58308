perf/x86/intel: Fix event update for auto-reload

There is a bug when reading event->count with large PEBS enabled.

Here is an example:

  # ./read_count
  0x71f0
  0x122c0
  0x1000000001c54
  0x100000001257d
  0x200000000bdc5

In fixed period mode, the auto-reload mechanism could be enabled for
PEBS events, but the calculation of event->count does not take the
auto-reload values into account.

Anyone who reads event->count will get the wrong result, e.g x86_pmu_read().

This bug was introduced with the auto-reload mechanism enabled since
commit:

  851559e35fd5 ("perf/x86/intel: Use the PEBS auto reload mechanism when possible")

Introduce intel_pmu_save_and_restart_reload() to calculate the
event->count only for auto-reload.

Since the counter increments a negative counter value and overflows on
the sign switch, giving the interval:

        [-period, 0]

the difference between two consequtive reads is:

 A) value2 - value1;
    when no overflows have happened in between,
 B) (0 - value1) + (value2 - (-period));
    when one overflow happened in between,
 C) (0 - value1) + (n - 1) * (period) + (value2 - (-period));
    when @n overflows happened in between.

Here A) is the obvious difference, B) is the extension to the discrete
interval, where the first term is to the top of the interval and the
second term is from the bottom of the next interval and C) the extension
to multiple intervals, where the middle term is the whole intervals
covered.

The equation for all cases is:

    value2 - value1 + n * period

Previously the event->count is updated right before the sample output.
But for case A, there is no PEBS record ready. It needs to be specially
handled.

Remove the auto-reload code from x86_perf_event_set_period() since
we'll not longer call that function in this case.
