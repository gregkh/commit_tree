media: lgdt3306a: Set fe ops.release to NULL if probed

If release is part of frontend ops then it is called in the
course of dvb_frontend_detach. The process also decrements
the module usage count. The problem is if the lgdt3306a
driver is reached via i2c_new_device, then when it is
eventually destroyed remove is called, which further
decrements the module usage count to negative. After this
occurs the driver is in a bad state and no longer works.
Also fixed by NULLing out the release callback is a double
kfree of state, which introduces arbitrary oopses/GPF.
This problem is only currently reachable via the em28xx driver.
