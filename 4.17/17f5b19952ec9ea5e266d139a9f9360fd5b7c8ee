crypto: omap-sham - Fix misleading indentation

Commit 8043bb1ae03c ("crypto: omap-sham - convert driver logic to use
sgs for data xmit") removed the if() clause leaving the statement as is.
The intention was in that case to finish the request always so the goto
instruction seems sensible.

Remove the indentation to fix Smatch warning:
    drivers/crypto/omap-sham.c:1761 omap_sham_done_task() warn: inconsistent indenting
