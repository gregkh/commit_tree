usb: core: Add "quirks" parameter for usbcore

Trying quirks in usbcore needs to rebuild the driver or the entire
kernel if it's builtin. It can save a lot of time if usbcore has similar
ability like "usbhid.quirks=" and "usb-storage.quirks=".

Rename the original quirk detection function to "static" as we introduce
this new "dynamic" function.

Now users can use "usbcore.quirks=" as short term workaround before the
next kernel release. Also, the quirk parameter can XOR the builtin
quirks for debugging purpose.

This is inspired by usbhid and usb-storage.
