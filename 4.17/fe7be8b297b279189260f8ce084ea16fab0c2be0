dt-bindings: arm: add support for ARM System Control and Management Interface(SCMI) protocol

This patch adds devicetree binding for System Control and Management
Interface (SCMI) Message Protocol used between the Application Cores(AP)
and the System Control Processor(SCP). The MHU peripheral provides a
mechanism for inter-processor communication between SCP's M3 processor
and AP.

SCP offers control and management of the core/cluster power states,
various power domain DVFS including the core/cluster, certain system
clocks configuration, thermal sensors and many others.

SCMI protocol is developed as better replacement to the existing SCPI
which is not flexible and easily extensible.
