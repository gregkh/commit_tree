RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix broken RoCE driver due to recent L2 driver changes

The recent changes in Broadcom's ethernet driver(L2 driver) broke
RoCE functionality in terms of MSIx vector allocation and
de-allocation.

There is a possibility that L2 driver would initiate MSIx vector
reallocation depending upon the requests coming from administrator.
In such cases L2 driver needs to free up all the MSIx vectors
allocated previously and reallocate/initialize those.

If RoCE driver is loaded and reshuffling is attempted, there will be
kernel crashes because RoCE driver would still be holding the MSIx
vectors but L2 driver would attempt to free in-use vectors. Thus
leading to a kernel crash.

Making changes in roce driver to fix crashes described above.
As part of solution L2 driver tells RoCE driver to release
the MSIx vector whenever there is a need. When RoCE driver
get message it sync up with all the running tasklets and IRQ
handlers and releases the vectors. L2 driver send one more
message to RoCE driver to resume the MSIx vectors. L2 driver
guarantees that RoCE vector do not change during reshuffling.
