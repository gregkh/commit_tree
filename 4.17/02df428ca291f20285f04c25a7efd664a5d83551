net: Convert simple pernet_operations

These pernet_operations make pretty simple actions
like variable initialization on init, debug checks
on exit, and so on, and they obviously are able
to be executed in parallel with any others:

vrf_net_ops
lockd_net_ops
grace_net_ops
xfrm6_tunnel_net_ops
kcm_net_ops
tcf_net_ops
