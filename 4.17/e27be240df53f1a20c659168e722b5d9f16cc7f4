mm: memcg: make sure memory.events is uptodate when waking pollers

Commit a983b5ebee57 ("mm: memcontrol: fix excessive complexity in
memory.stat reporting") added per-cpu drift to all memory cgroup stats
and events shown in memory.stat and memory.events.

For memory.stat this is acceptable.  But memory.events issues file
notifications, and somebody polling the file for changes will be
confused when the counters in it are unchanged after a wakeup.

Luckily, the events in memory.events - MEMCG_LOW, MEMCG_HIGH, MEMCG_MAX,
MEMCG_OOM - are sufficiently rare and high-level that we don't need
per-cpu buffering for them: MEMCG_HIGH and MEMCG_MAX would be the most
frequent, but they're counting invocations of reclaim, which is a
complex operation that touches many shared cachelines.

This splits memory.events from the generic VM events and tracks them in
their own, unbuffered atomic counters.  That's also cleaner, as it
eliminates the ugly enum nesting of VM and cgroup events.
