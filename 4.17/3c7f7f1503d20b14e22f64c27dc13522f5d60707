ARM64: dts: marvell: armada-cp110: Add registers clock for the crypto node

This extra clock is needed to access the registers of the safexcel EIP97
used on CP110 component of the Armada 7K/8K SoCs.

This follow the changes already made in the binding documentation (as
well as in the driver): "crypto: inside-secure - fix clock resource by
adding a register clock"
