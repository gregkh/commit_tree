bdi: wake up concurrent wb_shutdown() callers.

syzbot is reporting hung tasks at wait_on_bit(WB_shutting_down) in
wb_shutdown() [1]. This seems to be because commit 5318ce7d46866e1d ("bdi:
Shutdown writeback on all cgwbs in cgwb_bdi_destroy()") forgot to call
wake_up_bit(WB_shutting_down) after clear_bit(WB_shutting_down).

Introduce a helper function clear_and_wake_up_bit() and use it, in order
to avoid similar errors in future.
