staging: ks7010: Remove hostif_infrastructure_set2_request_t.

The handling of hostif_infrastructure_set_request_t and
hostif_infrastructure_set2_request_t is identical, with the exception
of the event type value.  Merge the two structs so they can be handled
by a single function ('hostif_infrastructure_set_request').
