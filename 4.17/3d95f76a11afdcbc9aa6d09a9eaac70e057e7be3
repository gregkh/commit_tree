drm/pl111: Properly detect the ARM PL110 variants

With a bit of refactoring we can contain the variant data for
the strange PL110 versions that is feature-incomplete PL110 for
the ARM Integrator/CP and somewhere inbetween PL110 and PL111
for the ARM Versatile AB and Versatile PB.

We also accomodate for the custom duct-taped RGB565/BGR565 support
in the Versatile variant.
