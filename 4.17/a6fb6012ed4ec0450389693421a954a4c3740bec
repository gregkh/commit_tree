init: Fix initcall0 name as it is "pure" not "early"

The early_initcall() functions get assigned to __initcall_start[]. These are
called by do_pre_smp_initcalls(). The initcall_levels[] array starts with
__initcall0_start[], and initcall_levels[] are to match the
initcall_level_names[] array. The first name in that array is "early", but
that is not correct. As pure_initcall() functions get assigned to
__initcall0_start[] array.

Change the first name in initcall_level_names[] array to "pure".
