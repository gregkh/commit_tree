drm/amd/display: fix cursor related Pstate hang

Move cursor programming to inside the OTG_MASTER_UPDATE_LOCK

If graphics plane go from 1 pipe to hsplit, the cursor updates
after mpc programming and unlock. Which means there is a window
of time where cursor is enabled on the wrong pipe if it's on
the right side of the screen (i.e. case where cursor need to
move from pipe 0 to pipe 3 post split). This will cause pstate hang.

Solution is to program the cursor while still locked.
