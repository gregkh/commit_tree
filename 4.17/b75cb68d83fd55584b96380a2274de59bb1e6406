arm64: dts: sunxi: Switch MMC nodes away from cd-inverted property

Using the cd-inverted property is not useful when GPIOs are used as card
detects since the polarity can be specified with the usual
GPIO_ACTIVE_(HIGH|LOW) GPIO flags. It has also caused confusion for
U-Boot developers, so migrate all sunxi boards away from cd-inverted.
