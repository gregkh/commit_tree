KVM: x86: Add module parameter for supporting VMware backdoor

Support access to VMware backdoor requires KVM to intercept #GP
exceptions from guest which introduce slight performance hit.
Therefore, control this support by module parameter.

Note that module parameter is exported as it should be consumed by
kvm_intel & kvm_amd to determine if they should intercept #GP or not.

This commit doesn't change semantics.
It is done as a preparation for future commits.
