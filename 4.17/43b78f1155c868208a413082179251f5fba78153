Revert "usb: host: ehci: Use dma_pool_zalloc()"

This reverts commit 22072e83ebd510fb6a090aef9d65ccfda9b1e7e4 as it is
broken.

	What you can't see just from reading the patch is that in both
	cases (ehci->itd_pool and ehci->sitd_pool) there are two
	allocation paths -- the two branches of an "if" statement -- and
	only one of the paths calls dma_pool_[z]alloc.  However, the
	memset is needed for both paths, and so it can't be eliminated.
	Given that it must be present, there's no advantage to calling
	dma_pool_zalloc rather than dma_pool_alloc.
