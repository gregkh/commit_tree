clk: mvebu: armada-38x: add support for missing clocks

Clearfog boards can come with a CPU clocked at 1600MHz (commercial)
or 1333MHz (industrial).

They have also some dip-switches to select a different clock (666, 800,
1066, 1200).

The funny thing is that the recovery button is on the MPP34 fq selector.
So, when booting an industrial board with this button down, the frequency
666MHz is selected (and the kernel didn't boot).

This patch add all the missing clocks.

The only mode I didn't test is 2GHz (uboot found 4294MHz instead :/ ).
