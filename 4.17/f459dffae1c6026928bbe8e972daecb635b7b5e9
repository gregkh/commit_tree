fs: add ksys_rmdir() wrapper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_rmdir()

Using this wrapper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the
sys_rmdir() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is meant
as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the same
calling convention as sys_rmdir().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
