init: fix false positives in W+X checking

load_module() creates W+X mappings via __vmalloc_node_range() (from
layout_and_allocate()->move_module()->module_alloc()) by using
PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC.  These mappings are later cleaned up via
"call_rcu_sched(&freeinit->rcu, do_free_init)" from do_init_module().

This is a problem because call_rcu_sched() queues work, which can be run
after debug_checkwx() is run, resulting in a race condition.  If hit,
the race results in a nasty splat about insecure W+X mappings, which
results in a poor user experience as these are not the mappings that
debug_checkwx() is intended to catch.

This issue is observed on multiple arm64 platforms, and has been
artificially triggered on an x86 platform.

Address the race by flushing the queued work before running the
arch-defined mark_rodata_ro() which then calls debug_checkwx().
