x86: kvm: hide the unused 'cpu' variable

The local variable was newly introduced but is only accessed in one
place on x86_64, but not on 32-bit:

arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c: In function 'vmx_save_host_state':
arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c:2175:6: error: unused variable 'cpu' [-Werror=unused-variable]

This puts it into another #ifdef.
