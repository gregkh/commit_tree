sparc: Make auxiliary vectors for ADI available on 32-bit as well

Commit c6202ca764ac ("sparc64: Add auxiliary vectors to report
platform ADI properties") adds auxiliary vectors to report ADI
capabilities on sparc64 platform only. This needs to be uniform
across 64-bit and 32-bit. This patch makes the same vectors
available on 32-bit as well.
