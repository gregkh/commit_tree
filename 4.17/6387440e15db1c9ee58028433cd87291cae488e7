audit: session ID should not set arch quick field pointer

A bug was introduced in 8fae47705685fcaa75a1fe4c8c3e18300a702979
("audit: add support for session ID user filter")
See: https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-kernel/issues/4

When setting a session ID filter, the session ID filter field overwrote
the quick pointer reference to the arch field, potentially causing the
arch field to be misinterpreted.

Passes audit-testsuite.
