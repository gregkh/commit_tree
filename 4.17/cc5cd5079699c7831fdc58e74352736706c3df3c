xen: xen-pciback: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in pcistub_probe

pcistub_probe() is never called in atomic context.
This function is only set as ".probe" in struct pci_driver.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
pcistub_probe() calls kmalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
which can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
