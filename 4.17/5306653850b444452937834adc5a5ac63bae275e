sctp: remove unnecessary asoc in sctp_has_association

After Commit dae399d7fdee ("sctp: hold transport instead of assoc
when lookup assoc in rx path"), it put transport instead of asoc
in sctp_has_association. Variable 'asoc' is not used any more.

So this patch is to remove it, while at it,  it also changes the
return type of sctp_has_association to bool, and does the same
for it's caller sctp_endpoint_is_peeled_off.
