ASoC: fsl_esai: Fix divisor calculation failure at lower ratio

When the desired ratio is less than 256, the savesub (tolerance)
in the calculation would become 0. This will then fail the loop-
search immediately without reporting any errors.

But if the ratio is smaller enough, there is no need to calculate
the tolerance because PM divisor alone is enough to get the ratio.

So a simple fix could be just to set PM directly instead of going
into the loop-search.
