MAINTAINERS: change hugetlbfs maintainer and update files

The current hugetlbfs maintainer has not been active for more than a few
years.  I have been been active in this area for more than two years and
plan to remain active in the foreseeable future.

Also, update the hugetlbfs entry to include linux-mm mail list and
additional hugetlbfs related files.  hugetlb.c and hugetlb.h are not
100% hugetlbfs, but a majority of their content is hugetlbfs related.
