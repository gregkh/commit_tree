x86/boot/compressed/64: Set up GOT for paging_prepare() and cleanup_trampoline()

Eric and Hugh have reported instant reboot due to my recent changes in
decompression code.

The root cause is that I didn't realize that we need to adjust GOT to be
able to run C code that early.

The problem is only visible with an older toolchain. Binutils >= 2.24 is
able to eliminate GOT references by replacing them with RIP-relative
address loads:

  https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commitdiff;h=80d873266dec

We need to adjust GOT two times:

 - before calling paging_prepare() using the initial load address
 - before calling C code from the relocated kernel
