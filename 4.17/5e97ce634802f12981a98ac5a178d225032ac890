i40evf: Alloc queues for ADq on VF

This patch allocates number of queues requested by the user as a part
of TC command when ADq is enabled on a VF.

In order to be consistent in design with PF implementation of ADq,
don't allow to set channels via ethtool from VF when ADq is already
enabled. This means the users will not be able to change the number of
queues/channels via ethtool for a VF when ADq is ON. In order to be
able to use set channels, users will be required to disable ADq first
and then try setting the channels again.

When ADq is enabled on VF, it goes through a reset during which VSIs
and queues are re-configured. Meanwhile if we receive link status
message from PF even before the queues are re-configured, just ignore
this link up message.
