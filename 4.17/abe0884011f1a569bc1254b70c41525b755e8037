bpf: Remove struct bpf_verifier_env argument from print_bpf_insn

We use print_bpf_insn in user space (bpftool and soon perf),
so it'd be nice to keep it generic and strip it off the kernel
struct bpf_verifier_env argument.

This argument can be safely removed, because its users can
use the struct bpf_insn_cbs::private_data to pass it.

By changing the argument type  we can no longer have clean
'verbose' alias to 'bpf_verifier_log_write' in verifier.c.
Instead  we're adding the  'verbose' cb_print callback and
removing the alias.

This way we have new cb_print callback in place, and all
the 'verbose(env, ...) calls in verifier.c will cleanly
cast to 'verbose(void *, ...)' so no other change is
needed.
