locking/percpu-rwsem: Annotate rwsem ownership transfer by setting RWSEM_OWNER_UNKNOWN

The filesystem freezing code needs to transfer ownership of a rwsem
embedded in a percpu-rwsem from the task that does the freezing to
another one that does the thawing by calling percpu_rwsem_release()
after freezing and percpu_rwsem_acquire() before thawing.

However, the new rwsem debug code runs afoul with this scheme by warning
that the task that releases the rwsem isn't the one that acquires it,
as reported by Amir Goldstein:

  DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(sem->owner != get_current())
  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1401 at /home/amir/build/src/linux/kernel/locking/rwsem.c:133 up_write+0x59/0x79

  Call Trace:
   percpu_up_write+0x1f/0x28
   thaw_super_locked+0xdf/0x120
   do_vfs_ioctl+0x270/0x5f1
   ksys_ioctl+0x52/0x71
   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x16/0x19
   do_syscall_64+0x5d/0x167
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x49/0xbe

To work properly with the rwsem debug code, we need to annotate that the
rwsem ownership is unknown during the tranfer period until a brave soul
comes forward to acquire the ownership. During that period, optimistic
spinning will be disabled.
