tracing: Make the snapshot trigger work with instances

The snapshot trigger currently only affects the main ring buffer, even when
it is used by the instances. This can be confusing as the snapshot trigger
is listed in the instance.

 > # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 > # mkdir instances/foo
 > # echo snapshot > instances/foo/events/syscalls/sys_enter_fchownat/trigger
 > # echo top buffer > trace_marker
 > # echo foo buffer > instances/foo/trace_marker
 > # touch /tmp/bar
 > # chown rostedt /tmp/bar
 > # cat instances/foo/snapshot
 # tracer: nop
 #
 #
 # * Snapshot is freed *
 #
 # Snapshot commands:
 # echo 0 > snapshot : Clears and frees snapshot buffer
 # echo 1 > snapshot : Allocates snapshot buffer, if not already allocated.
 #                      Takes a snapshot of the main buffer.
 # echo 2 > snapshot : Clears snapshot buffer (but does not allocate or free)
 #                      (Doesn't have to be '2' works with any number that
 #                       is not a '0' or '1')

 > # cat snapshot
 # tracer: nop

             bash-1189  [000] ....   111.488323: tracing_mark_write: top buffer

Not only did the snapshot occur in the top level buffer, but the instance
snapshot buffer should have been allocated, and it is still free.
