brcmsmac: allocate ucode with GFP_KERNEL

The brcms_ucode_init_buf() duplicates the ucode chunks via kmemdup()
with GFP_ATOMIC as a precondition of wl->lock acquired.  This caused
allocation failures sometimes as reported in the bugzilla below.

When looking at the the real usage, one can find that it's called
solely from brcms_request_fw(), and it's obviously outside the lock.
Hence we can use GFP_KERNEL there safely for avoiding such allocation
errors.
