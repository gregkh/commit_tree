net/mlx5: Mkey creation command adjustments

This change updates the mlx5 interface to create mkey
on the device.

The updates in the command mailbox include increasing the
access mode type field to 5 bits in order to support additional
types such as MLX5_MKC_ACCESS_MODE_MEMIC which represents device
memory access type and will be used when registering MR on allocated
device memory.

All the places that use the old access mode format are adjusted as
well.
