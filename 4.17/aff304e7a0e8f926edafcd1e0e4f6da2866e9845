s390/crypto: Adjust s390 aes and paes cipher priorities

Tests with paes-xts and debugging investigations showed
that the ciphers are not always correctly resolved.
The rules for cipher priorities seem to be:
 - Ecb-aes should have a prio greater than the
   generic ecb-aes.
 - The mode specialized ciphers (like cbc-aes-s390)
   should have a prio greater than the sum of the
   more generic combinations (like cbs(aes)).

This patch adjusts the cipher priorities for the
s390 aes and paes in kernel crypto implementations.
