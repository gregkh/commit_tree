bpf: sockmap sample test for bpf_msg_pull_data

This adds an option to test the msg_pull_data helper. This
uses two options txmsg_start and txmsg_end to let the user
specify start and end bytes to pull.

The options can be used with txmsg_apply, txmsg_cork options
as well as with any of the basic tests, txmsg, txmsg_redir and
txmsg_drop (plus noisy variants) to run pull_data inline with
those tests. By giving user direct control over the variables
we can easily do negative testing as well as positive tests.
