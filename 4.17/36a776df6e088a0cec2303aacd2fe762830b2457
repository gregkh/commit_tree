drm/bridge: Provide a way to embed timing info in bridges

After some discussion and failed patch sets trying to convey
the right timing information between the display engine and
a bridge using the connector, I try instead to use an optional
timing information container in the bridge itself, so that
display engines can retrieve it from any bridge and use it to
determine how to drive outputs.
