selinux: add AF_UNSPEC and INADDR_ANY checks to selinux_socket_bind()

Commit d452930fd3b9 ("selinux: Add SCTP support") breaks compatibility
with the old programs that can pass sockaddr_in structure with AF_UNSPEC
and INADDR_ANY to bind(). As a result, bind() returns EAFNOSUPPORT error.
This was found with LTP/asapi_01 test.

Similar to commit 29c486df6a20 ("net: ipv4: relax AF_INET check in
bind()"), which relaxed AF_INET check for compatibility, add AF_UNSPEC
case to AF_INET and make sure that the address is INADDR_ANY.
