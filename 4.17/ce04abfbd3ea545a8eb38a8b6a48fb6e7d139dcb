perf list: Remove s390 specific strcmp_cpuid_cmp function

Make the type field in pmu-events/arch/s390/mapfile.cvs more generic to
match the created cpuid string for s390.

The pattern also checks for the counter first version number and counter
second version number ([13]\.[1-5]) and the authorization field which
follows.

These numbers do not exist in the cpuid identification string when perf
commands are executed on a z/VM environment (which does not support CPU
counter measurement facility).

CPUID string for LPAR:
   cpuid : IBM,3906,704,M03,3.5,002f
CPUID string for z/VM:
   cpuid : IBM,2964,702,N96

This allows the removal of s390 specific cpuid compare code and uses the
common compare function with its regular expression matching algorithm.
