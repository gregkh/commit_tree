gpioib: do not free unrequested descriptors

If the main loop in linehandle_create() encounters an error, it
unwinds completely by freeing all previously requested GPIO
descriptors.  However, if the error occurs in the beginning of
the loop before that GPIO is requested, then the exit code
attempts to free a null descriptor.  If extrachecks is enabled,
gpiod_free() triggers a WARN_ON.

Instead, keep a separate count of legitimate GPIOs so that only
those are freed.
