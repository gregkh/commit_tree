drm/i915/pmu: Only enumerate available counters in sysfs

Switch over to dynamically creating device attributes, which are in turn
used by the perf core to expose available counters in sysfs.

This way we do not expose counters which are not avaiable on the current
platform, and are so more consistent between what we reply to open
attempts via the perf_event_open(2), and what is discoverable in sysfs.

v2:
 * Simplify attribute pointer freeing loop.
 * Changed attr init from macro to function.
 * More common error unwind. (Chris Wilson)
 * Rename some locals. (Chris Wilson)

v3:
 * Fixed double semi-colon. (Chris Wilson)
