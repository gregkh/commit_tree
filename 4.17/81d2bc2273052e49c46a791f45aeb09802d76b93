kconfig: invoke oldconfig instead of silentoldconfig from local*config

The purpose of local{yes,mod}config is to arrange the .config file
based on actually loaded modules.  It is unnecessary to update
include/generated/autoconf.h and include/config/* stuff here.
They will be updated as needed during the build.
