fs: add ksys_mount() helper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_mount()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the sys_mount()
syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is meant as a drop-in
replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the same calling
convention as sys_mount().

In the near future, all callers of ksys_mount() should be converted to call
do_mount() directly.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
