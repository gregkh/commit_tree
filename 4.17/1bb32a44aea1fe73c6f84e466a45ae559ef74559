KVM: arm/arm64: Keep GICv2 HYP VAs in kvm_vgic_global_state

As we're about to change the way we map devices at HYP, we need
to move away from kern_hyp_va on an IO address.

One way of achieving this is to store the VAs in kvm_vgic_global_state,
and use that directly from the HYP code. This requires a small change
to create_hyp_io_mappings so that it can also return a HYP VA.

We take this opportunity to nuke the vctrl_base field in the emulated
distributor, as it is not used anymore.
