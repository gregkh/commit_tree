mm: Add address parameter to arch_validate_prot()

A protection flag may not be valid across entire address space and
hence arch_validate_prot() might need the address a protection bit is
being set on to ensure it is a valid protection flag. For example, sparc
processors support memory corruption detection (as part of ADI feature)
flag on memory addresses mapped on to physical RAM but not on PFN mapped
pages or addresses mapped on to devices. This patch adds address to the
parameters being passed to arch_validate_prot() so protection bits can
be validated in the relevant context.
