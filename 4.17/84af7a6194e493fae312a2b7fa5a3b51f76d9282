checkpatch: kconfig: prefer 'help' over '---help---'

IMO, we should discourage '---help---' for new help texts, even in cases
where it would be consistent with other help texts in the file. This
will help if we ever want to get rid of '---help---' in the future.

Also simplify the code to only check for exactly '---help---'. Since
commit c2264564df3d ("kconfig: warn of unhandled characters in Kconfig
commands"), '---help---' is a proper keyword and can only appear in that
form. Prior to that commit, '---help---' working was more of a syntactic
quirk.
