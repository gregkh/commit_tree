fs: add do_linkat() helper and ksys_link() wrapper; remove in-kernel calls to syscall

Using the fs-internal do_linkat() helper allows us to get rid of
fs-internal calls to the sys_linkat() syscall.

Introducing the ksys_link() wrapper allows us to avoid the in-kernel
calls to sys_link() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function
is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses
the same calling convention as sys_link().

In the near future, the only fs-external user of ksys_link() should be
converted to use vfs_link() instead.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
