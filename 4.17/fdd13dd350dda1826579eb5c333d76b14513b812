qed: Fix mask for physical address in ILT entry

ILT entry requires 12 bit right shifted physical address.
Existing mask for ILT entry of physical address i.e.
ILT_ENTRY_PHY_ADDR_MASK is not sufficient to handle 64bit
address because upper 8 bits of 64 bit address were getting
masked which resulted in completer abort error on
PCIe bus due to invalid address.

Fix that mask to handle 64bit physical address.
