net/mlx5: Refactor accel IPSec code

The current code has one layer that executed FPGA commands and
the Ethernet part directly used this code. Since downstream patches
introduces support for IPSec in mlx5_ib, we need to provide some
abstractions. This patch refactors the accel code into one layer
that creates a software IPSec transformation and another one which
creates the actual hardware context.
The internal command implementation is now hidden in the FPGA
core layer. The code also adds the ability to share FPGA hardware
contexts. If two contexts are the same, only a reference count
is taken.
