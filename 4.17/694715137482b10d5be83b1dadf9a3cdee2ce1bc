lightnvm: add support for 2.0 address format

Add support for 2.0 address format. Also, align address bits for 1.2 and
2.0 to be able to operate on channel and luns without requiring a format
conversion. Use a generic address format for this purpose.

Also, convert the generic operations to the generic format in pblk.
