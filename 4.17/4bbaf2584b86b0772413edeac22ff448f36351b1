s390/cpum_sf: ensure sample frequency of perf event attributes is non-zero

Correct a trinity finding for the perf_event_open() system call with
a perf event attribute structure that uses a frequency but has the
sampling frequency set to zero.  This causes a FP divide exception during
the sample rate initialization for the hardware sampling facility.
