x86/mm: Consider effective protection attributes in W+X check

Using just the leaf page table entry flags would cause a false warning
in case _PAGE_RW is clear or _PAGE_NX is set in a higher level entry.
Hand through both the current entry's flags as well as the accumulated
effective value (the latter as pgprotval_t instead of pgprot_t, as it's
not an actual entry's value).

This in particular eliminates the false W+X warning when running under
Xen, as commit:

  2cc42bac1c ("x86-64/Xen: eliminate W+X mappings")

had to make the necessary adjustment in L2 rather than L1 (the reason is
explained there). I.e. _PAGE_RW is clear there in L1, but _PAGE_NX is
set in L2.
