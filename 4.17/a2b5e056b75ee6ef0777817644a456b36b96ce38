powerpc/powernv: Fix SMT4 forcing idle code

The PSSCR value is not stored to PACA_REQ_PSSCR if the CPU does not
have the XER[SO] bug.

Fix this by storing up-front, outside the workaround code. The initial
test is not required because it is a slow path.

The workaround is made to depend on CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_HV_POSSIBLE, to
match pnv_power9_force_smt4_catch() where it is used. Drop the comment
on pnv_power9_force_smt4_catch() as it's no longer true.
