z3fold: limit use of stale list for allocation

Currently if z3fold couldn't find an unbuddied page it would first try
to pull a page off the stale list.  The problem with this approach is
that we can't 100% guarantee that the page is not processed by the
workqueue thread at the same time unless we run cancel_work_sync() on
it, which we can't do if we're in an atomic context.  So let's just
limit stale list usage to non-atomic contexts only.
