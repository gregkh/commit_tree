net/ipv6: Make rt6_multipath_hash similar to fib_multipath_hash

Make rt6_multipath_hash more of a direct parallel to fib_multipath_hash
and reduce stack and overhead in the process: get_hash_from_flowi6 is
just a wrapper around __get_hash_from_flowi6 with another stack
allocation for flow_keys. Move setting the addresses, protocol and
label into rt6_multipath_hash and allow it to make the call to
flow_hash_from_keys.
