s390/purgatory: Fix endless interrupt loop

New compilers use the floating-point registers as spill registers when
there is high register pressure. In the purgatory however, the afp control
bit is not set. This leads to an exception whenever a floating-point
instruction is used, which again causes an interrupt loop.

Forbid the compiler to use floating-point instructions by adding
-msoft-float to KBUILD_CFLAGS.
