drm/stm: ltdc: use crtc_mode_fixup to update adjusted_mode clock

There is a difference between the panel/bridge requested pixel clock
value and the real one due to the hw platform clock preciseness (pll,
dividers...). This patch updates the adjusted_mode clock value with
the real hw clock value so then attached encoder & connector can use
it for precise timing computations.
