ASoC: hdac_hdmi : Ensuring proper setting of output widget power state

In usecases like hot plug-unplug DP panel or modeset during a playback,
sometimes we observe no audio after codec resets. During no audio
condition, we have noticed that the power state of the pin or the
connector is D3. Optimizing the way we set the power mitigates the
issue. With this changes the verb is sent to set the power state and
waits until actual state reaches target state. Thus ensuring power
state is set.
