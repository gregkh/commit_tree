crypto: arm64/aes-blk - remove configurable interleave

The AES block mode implementation using Crypto Extensions or plain NEON
was written before real hardware existed, and so its interleave factor
was made build time configurable (as well as an option to instantiate
all interleaved sequences inline rather than as subroutines)

We ended up using INTERLEAVE=4 with inlining disabled for both flavors
of the core AES routines, so let's stick with that, and remove the option
to configure this at build time. This makes the code easier to modify,
which is nice now that we're adding yield support.
