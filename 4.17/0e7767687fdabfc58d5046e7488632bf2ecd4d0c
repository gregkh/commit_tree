time: tick-sched: Reorganize idle tick management code

Prepare the scheduler tick code for reworking the idle loop to
avoid stopping the tick in some cases.

The idea is to split the nohz idle entry call to decouple the idle
time stats accounting and preparatory work from the actual tick stop
code, in order to later be able to delay the tick stop once we reach
more power-knowledgeable callers.

Move away the tick_nohz_start_idle() invocation from
__tick_nohz_idle_enter(), rename the latter to
__tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick() and define tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick()
as a wrapper around it for calling it from the outside.

Make tick_nohz_idle_enter() only call tick_nohz_start_idle() instead
of calling the entire __tick_nohz_idle_enter(), add another wrapper
disabling and enabling interrupts around tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick()
and make the current callers of tick_nohz_idle_enter() call it too
to retain their current functionality.
