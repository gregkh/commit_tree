ixgbe: tweak page counting for XDP_REDIRECT

The current page counting scheme assumes that the reference count
cannot decrease until the received frame is sent to the upper layers
of the networking stack. This assumption does not hold for the
XDP_REDIRECT action, since a page (pointed out by xdp_buff) can have
its reference count decreased via the xdp_do_redirect call.

To work around that, we now start off by a large page count and then
don't allow a refcount less than two.
