ext4: limit xattr size to INT_MAX

ext4 isn't validating the sizes of xattrs where the value of the xattr
is stored in an external inode.  This is problematic because
->e_value_size is a u32, but ext4_xattr_get() returns an int.  A very
large size is misinterpreted as an error code, which ext4_get_acl()
translates into a bogus ERR_PTR() for which IS_ERR() returns false,
causing a crash.

Fix this by validating that all xattrs are <= INT_MAX bytes.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-1095.
