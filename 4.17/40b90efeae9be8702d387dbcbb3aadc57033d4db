kdb: use ktime_get_mono_fast_ns() instead of ktime_get_ts()

The kdb code will print the monotonic time by ktime_get_ts(), but
the ktime_get_ts() will be protected by a sequence lock, that will
introduce one deadlock risk if the lock was already held in the
context from which we entered the debugger.

Thus we can use the ktime_get_mono_fast_ns() to get the monotonic
time, which is NMI safe access to clock monotonic. Moreover we can
remove the 'struct timespec', which is not y2038 safe.
