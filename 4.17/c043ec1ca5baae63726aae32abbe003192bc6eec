iio:buffer: make length types match kfifo types

Currently, we use int for buffer length and bytes_per_datum. However,
kfifo uses unsigned int for length and size_t for element size. We need
to make sure these matches or we will have bugs related to overflow (in
the range between INT_MAX and UINT_MAX for length, for example).

In addition, set_bytes_per_datum uses size_t while bytes_per_datum is an
int, which would cause bugs for large values of bytes_per_datum.

Change buffer length to use unsigned int and bytes_per_datum to use
size_t.
