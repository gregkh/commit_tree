media: cx25821: prevent out-of-bounds read on array card

Currently an out of range dev->nr is detected by just reporting the
issue and later on an out-of-bounds read on array card occurs because
of this. Fix this by checking the upper range of dev->nr with the size
of array card (removes the hard coded size), move this check earlier
and also exit with the error -ENOSYS to avoid the later out-of-bounds
array read.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#711191 ("Out-of-bounds-read")
