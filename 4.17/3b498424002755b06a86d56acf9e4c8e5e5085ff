media: ov5640: fix framerate update

After a framerate update through s_frame_interval(), the new
framerate was not taken into account when streaming,
but was taken into account on next session.
This was due to sensor->current_mode not updated accordingly to new
framerate setting in ov5640_s_frame_interval().
