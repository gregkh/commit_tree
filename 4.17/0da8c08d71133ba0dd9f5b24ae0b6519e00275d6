torture: Grace periods do not piggyback off of themselves

The rcuperf trace-event processing counted every "done" trace event
as a piggyback, which is incorrect because the task that started the
grace period didn't piggyback at all.  This commit fixes this problem
by recording the task that started a given grace period and ignoring
that task's "done" record for that grace period.
