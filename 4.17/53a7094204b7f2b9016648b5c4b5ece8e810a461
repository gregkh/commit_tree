Revert "mwifiex: fix incorrect ht capability problem"

This reverts commit bcc920e8f08336cbbdcdba7c4449c27137e6b4b9.

Drivers gets hardware info and updates ht_cap field of
wiphy->bands during initialization. Once updated during init,
ht_cap must not be modified as it reflects the capability
supported by hardwawre. Above patch tries to modify the ht_cap
field and this results in wrongly advertising capabilities during
association.
