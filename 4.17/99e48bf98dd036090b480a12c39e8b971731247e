drm/i915: Lock out execlist tasklet while peeking inside for busy-stats

In order to prevent a race condition where we may end up overaccounting
the active state and leaving the busy-stats believing the GPU is 100%
busy, lock out the tasklet while we reconstruct the busy state. There is
no direct spinlock guard for the execlists->port[], so we need to
utilise tasklet_disable() as a synchronous barrier to prevent it, the
only writer to execlists->port[], from running at the same time as the
enable.
