arm64: lse: Pass -fomit-frame-pointer to out-of-line ll/sc atomics

In cases where x30 is used as a temporary in the out-of-line ll/sc atomics
(e.g. atomic_fetch_add), the compiler tends to put out a full stackframe,
which included pointing the x29 at the new frame.

Since these things aren't traceable anyway, we can pass -fomit-frame-pointer
to reduce the work when spilling. Since this is incompatible with -pg, we
also remove that from the CFLAGS for this file.
