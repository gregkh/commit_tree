video: smscufx: Less checks in ufx_usb_probe() after error detection

Up to four checks could be repeated by the ufx_usb_probe() function
during error handling even if the relevant properties can be determined
for the involved variables before by source code analysis.

* Return directly after a call of the function "kzalloc" failed
  at the beginning.

* Adjust jump targets so that extra checks can be omitted at the end.

* Delete initialisations for the variables "info" and "retval"
  which became unnecessary with this refactoring.
