ipv4: fix fnhe usage by non-cached routes

Allow some non-cached routes to use non-expired fnhe:

1. ip_del_fnhe: moved above and now called by find_exception.
The 4.5+ commit deed49df7390 expires fnhe only when caching
routes. Change that to:

1.1. use fnhe for non-cached local output routes, with the help
from (2)

1.2. allow __mkroute_input to detect expired fnhe (outdated
fnhe_gw, for example) when do_cache is false, eg. when itag!=0
for unicast destinations.

2. __mkroute_output: keep fi to allow local routes with orig_oif != 0
to use fnhe info even when the new route will not be cached into fnhe.
After commit 839da4d98960 ("net: ipv4: set orig_oif based on fib
result for local traffic") it means all local routes will be affected
because they are not cached. This change is used to solve a PMTU
problem with IPVS (and probably Netfilter DNAT) setups that redirect
local clients from target local IP (local route to Virtual IP)
to new remote IP target, eg. IPVS TUN real server. Loopback has
64K MTU and we need to create fnhe on the local route that will
keep the reduced PMTU for the Virtual IP. Without this change
fnhe_pmtu is updated from ICMP but never exposed to non-cached
local routes. This includes routes with flowi4_oif!=0 for 4.6+ and
with flowi4_oif=any for 4.14+).

3. update_or_create_fnhe: make sure fnhe_expires is not 0 for
new entries
