kernel/kexec_file.c: remove mis-use of sh_offset field during purgatory load

The current code uses the sh_offset field in purgatory_info->sechdrs to
store a pointer to the current load address of the section.  Depending
whether the section will be loaded or not this is either a pointer into
purgatory_info->purgatory_buf or kexec_purgatory.  This is not only a
violation of the ELF standard but also makes the code very hard to
understand as you cannot tell if the memory you are using is read-only
or not.

Remove this misuse and store the offset of the section in
pugaroty_info->purgatory_buf in sh_offset.
