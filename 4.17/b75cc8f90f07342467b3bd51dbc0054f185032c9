net/ipv6: Pass skb to route lookup

IPv6 does path selection for multipath routes deep in the lookup
functions. The next patch adds L4 hash option and needs the skb
for the forward path. To get the skb to the relevant FIB lookup
functions it needs to go through the fib rules layer, so add a
lookup_data argument to the fib_lookup_arg struct.
