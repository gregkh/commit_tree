KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: fix possible spectre-v1 in vgic_mmio_read_apr()

It's possible for userspace to control n. Sanitize n when using it as an
array index.

Note that while it appears that n must be bound to the interval [0,3]
due to the way it is extracted from addr, we cannot guarantee that
compiler transformations (and/or future refactoring) will ensure this is
the case, and given this is a slow path it's better to always perform
the masking.
