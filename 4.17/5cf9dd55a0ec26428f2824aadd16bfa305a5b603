afs: Prospectively look up extra files when doing a single lookup

When afs_lookup() is called, prospectively look up the next 50 uncached
fids also from that same directory and cache the results, rather than just
looking up the one file requested.

This allows us to use the FS.InlineBulkStatus RPC op to increase efficiency
by fetching up to 50 file statuses at a time.
