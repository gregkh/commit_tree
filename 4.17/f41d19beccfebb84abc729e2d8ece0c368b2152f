drm/i915: Flush waiters on seqno wraparound

Previously, we would spin waiting for all waiters to wake up and notice
their request had completed before we would reset the seqno upon
wraparound.  However, we can mark their waits as complete and wake them
up directly using the existing machinery for handling the flushing of
missed wakeups when idling.
