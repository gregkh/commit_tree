Revert "ipc/shm: Fix shmat mmap nil-page protection"

Patch series "ipc/shm: shmat() fixes around nil-page".

These patches fix two issues reported[1] a while back by Joe and Andrea
around how shmat(2) behaves with nil-page.

The first reverts a commit that it was incorrectly thought that mapping
nil-page (address=0) was a no no with MAP_FIXED.  This is not the case,
with the exception of SHM_REMAP; which is address in the second patch.

I chose two patches because it is easier to backport and it explicitly
reverts bogus behaviour.  Both patches ought to be in -stable and ltp
testcases need updated (the added testcase around the cve can be
modified to just test for SHM_RND|SHM_REMAP).

This patch (of 2):

Commit 95e91b831f87 ("ipc/shm: Fix shmat mmap nil-page protection")
worked on the idea that we should not be mapping as root addr=0 and
MAP_FIXED.  However, it was reported that this scenario is in fact
valid, thus making the patch both bogus and breaks userspace as well.

For example X11's libint10.so relies on shmat(1, SHM_RND) for lowmem
initialization[1].
