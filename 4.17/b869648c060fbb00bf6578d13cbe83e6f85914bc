crypto: inside-secure - move the digest to the request context

This patches moves the digest information from the transformation
context to the request context. This fixes cases where HMAC init
functions were called and override the digest value for a short period
of time, as the HMAC init functions call the SHA init one which reset
the value. This lead to a small percentage of HMAC being incorrectly
computed under heavy load.
