ARM64: dts: marvell: armada-cp110: Add registers clock for the NAND node

This extra clock is needed to access the registers of the NAND controller
used on CP110 component of the Armada 7K/8K SoCs.

This follow the changes already made in the binding documentation (as
well as in the driver): "mtd: nand: marvell: Fix clock resource by adding
a register clock"
