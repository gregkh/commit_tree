nvme: Skip checking heads without namespaces

If a task is holding a reference to a namespace on a removed controller,
the head will not be released. If the same controller is added again
later, its namespaces may not be successfully added. Instead, the user
will see kernel message "Duplicate IDs for nsid <X>".

This patch fixes that by skipping heads that don't have namespaces when
considering if a new namespace is safe to add.
