ARM: kexec: fix kdump register saving on panic()

When a panic() occurs, the kexec code uses smp_send_stop() to stop
the other CPUs, but this results in the CPU register state not being
saved, and gdb is unable to inspect the state of other CPUs.

Commit 0ee59413c967 ("x86/panic: replace smp_send_stop() with kdump
friendly version in panic path") addressed the issue on x86, but
ignored other architectures.  Address the issue on ARM by splitting
out the crash stop implementation to crash_smp_send_stop() and
adding the necessary protection.
