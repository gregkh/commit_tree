ice: Do not check INTEVENT bit for OICR interrupts

According to the hardware spec, checking the INTEVENT bit isn't a
reliable way to detect if an OICR interrupt has occurred. This is
because this bit can be cleared by the hardware/firmware before the
interrupt service routine has run. So instead, just check for OICR
events every time.
