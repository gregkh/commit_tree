net: socket: replace calls to sys_send() with __sys_sendto()

sys_send() merely expands the parameters to __sys_sendto() by NULL and 0.
Open-code this in the two places which used sys_send() as a wrapper to
__sys_sendto().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
