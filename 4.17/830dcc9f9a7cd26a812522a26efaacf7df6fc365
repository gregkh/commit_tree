arm64: capabilities: Change scope of VHE to Boot CPU feature

We expect all CPUs to be running at the same EL inside the kernel
with or without VHE enabled and we have strict checks to ensure
that any mismatch triggers a kernel panic. If VHE is enabled,
we use the feature based on the boot CPU and all other CPUs
should follow. This makes it a perfect candidate for a capability
based on the boot CPU,  which should be matched by all the CPUs
(both when is ON and OFF). This saves us some not-so-pretty
hooks and special code, just for verifying the conflict.

The patch also makes the VHE capability entry depend on
CONFIG_ARM64_VHE.
