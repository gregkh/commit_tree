MIPS: Fix ptrace(2) PTRACE_PEEKUSR and PTRACE_POKEUSR accesses to o32 FGRs

Check the TIF_32BIT_FPREGS task setting of the tracee rather than the
tracer in determining the layout of floating-point general registers in
the floating-point context, correcting access to odd-numbered registers
for o32 tracees where the setting disagrees between the two processes.
