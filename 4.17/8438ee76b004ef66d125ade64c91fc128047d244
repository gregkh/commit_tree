Makefile: disable PIE before testing asm goto

Since commit e501ce957a78 ("x86: Force asm-goto"), aarch64 build on
distributions which enable PIE by default (e.g. openSUSE Tumbleweed) does
not detect support for asm goto correctly. The problem is that ARM specific
part of scripts/gcc-goto.sh fails with PIE even with recent gcc versions.
Moving the asm goto detection up in Makefile put it before the place where
we disable PIE. As a result, kernel is built without jump label support.

Move the lines disabling PIE before the asm goto test to make it work.
