KVM: VMX: don't configure EPT identity map for unrestricted guest

An unrestricted guest can run with hardware CR0.PG==0, i.e.
IA32 paging disabled, in which case there is no need to load
the guest's CR3 with identity mapped IA32 page tables since
hardware will effectively ignore CR3.  If unrestricted guest
is enabled, don't configure the identity mapped IA32 page
table and always load the guest's desired CR3.
