of: overlay: do not include path in full_name of added nodes

Struct device_node full_name no longer includes the full path name
when the devicetree is created from a flattened device tree (FDT).
The overlay node creation code was not modified to reflect this
change.  Fix the node full_name generated by overlay code to contain
only the basename.

Unittests call an overlay internal function to create new nodes.
Fix up these calls to provide basename only instead of the full
path.

Fixes: a7e4cfb0a7ca ("of/fdt: only store the device node basename
in full_name")
