net/mlx5e: Save MTU in channels params

Knowing the MTU is required for RQ creation flow.
By our design, channels creation flow is totally isolated
from priv/netdev, and can be completed with access to
channels params and mdev.
Adding the MTU to the channels params helps preserving that.
In addition, we save it in RQ to make its access faster in
datapath checks.
