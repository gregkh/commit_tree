kconfig: remove redundant streamline_config.pl prerequisite

The local{yes,mod}config targets currently have streamline_config.pl as
a prerequisite. This is redundant, because streamline_config.pl is a
checked-in file with no prerequisites.

Remove the prerequisite and reference streamline_config.pl directly in
the recipe of the rule instead.
