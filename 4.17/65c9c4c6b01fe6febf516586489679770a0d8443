usb: dwc2: Add dwc2_handle_gpwrdn_intr() handler

The GPWRDN interrupts are those that occur in both Host and
Device mode while core is in hibernated state.

Export dwc2_core_init to be able to use it in GPWRDN_IDSTS
interrupt handler.

Here we have duplicated init functions in host and gadget sides
so I have left things as it was(used corresponing functions for
host and gadget), maybe in the future we'll resolve this problem
and will use dwc2_core_init for both sides.
