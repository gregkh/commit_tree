mm/hmm: cleanup special vma handling (VM_SPECIAL)

Special vma (one with any of the VM_SPECIAL flags) can not be access by
device because there is no consistent model across device drivers on those
vma and their backing memory.

This patch directly use hmm_range struct for hmm_pfns_special() argument
as it is always affecting the whole vma and thus the whole range.

It also make behavior consistent after this patch both hmm_vma_fault() and
hmm_vma_get_pfns() returns -EINVAL when facing such vma.  Previously
hmm_vma_fault() returned 0 and hmm_vma_get_pfns() return -EINVAL but both
were filling the HMM pfn array with special entry.
