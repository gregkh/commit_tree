Revert "gpio: winbond: fix ISA_BUS_API dependency"

This reverts commit 92a8046c9d952a2a7d21dfcd3afadc72a0bc0f72.

Now that the patch series changing ISA_BUS_API dependency to selection
was merged this reversion will do the same for gpio-winbond driver to
make it consistent with other ISA bus gpio drivers.
