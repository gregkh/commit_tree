serial: imx: consistently use imx_uart_ as prefix for all functions

Having a fixed prefix helps at several places. It ensures that another
driver doesn't use the same function name which confuses the linker and
tools like ctags. It simplifies working with function tracing and
dynamic printk() support which can filter on function names. And last
but not least it helps the human source code reader to understand if a
given function belongs to a driver or a more general part of the kernel.
