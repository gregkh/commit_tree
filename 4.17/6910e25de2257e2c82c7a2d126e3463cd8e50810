sctp: remove sctp_chunk_put from fail_mark err path in sctp_ulpevent_make_rcvmsg

In Commit 1f45f78f8e51 ("sctp: allow GSO frags to access the chunk too"),
it held the chunk in sctp_ulpevent_make_rcvmsg to access it safely later
in recvmsg. However, it also added sctp_chunk_put in fail_mark err path,
which is only triggered before holding the chunk.

syzbot reported a use-after-free crash happened on this err path, where
it shouldn't call sctp_chunk_put.

This patch simply removes this call.
