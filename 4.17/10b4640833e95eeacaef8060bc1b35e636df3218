spi: sh-msiof: Fix bit field overflow writes to TSCR/RSCR

The change fixes a bit field overflow which allows to write to higher
bits while calculating SPI transfer clock and setting BRPS and BRDV
bit fields, the problem is reproduced if 'parent_rate' to 'spi_hz'
ratio is greater than 1024, for instance

  p->min_div      = 2,
  MSO rate        = 33333333,
  SPI device rate = 10000

results in

  k          = 5, i.e. BRDV = 0b100 or 1/32 prescaler output,
  BRPS       = 105,
  TSCR value = 0x6804, thus MSSEL and MSIMM bit fields are non-zero.
