perf cgroup: Add evlist__add_default_cgroup()

So that tools like 'perf trace' can allow the user to set a cgroup
to be used for all the evsels still without a crgroup setup by
parse_cgroups(), such as the one to use for the syscalls, vfs_getname
and other events involved in strace like syscall tracing.
