sched/fair: Add ';' after label attributes

Due to using GCC defines for configuration, some labels might be unused in
certain configurations. While adding a __maybe_unused to the label is
fine in general, the line has to be terminated with ';'. This is also
reflected in the GCC documentation, but GCC parsed the previous variant
without an error message.

This has been spotted while compiling with goto-cc, the compiler for the
CPROVER tool suite.
