powerpc/64: Use array of paca pointers and allocate pacas individually

Change the paca array into an array of pointers to pacas. Allocate
pacas individually.

This allows flexibility in where the PACAs are allocated. Future work
will allocate them node-local. Platforms that don't have address limits
on PACAs would be able to defer PACA allocations until later in boot
rather than allocate all possible ones up-front then freeing unused.

This is slightly more overhead (one additional indirection) for cross
CPU paca references, but those aren't too common.
