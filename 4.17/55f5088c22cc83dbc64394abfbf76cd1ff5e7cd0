svc: Report xprt dequeue latency

Record the time between when a rqstp is enqueued on a transport
and when it is dequeued. This includes how long the rqstp waits on
the queue and how long it takes the kernel scheduler to wake a
nfsd thread to service it.

The svc_xprt_dequeue trace point is altered to include the number
of microseconds between xprt_enqueue and xprt_dequeue.
