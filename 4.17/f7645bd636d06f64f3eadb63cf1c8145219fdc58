ALSA: usb-audio: Refactor clock finder helpers

There are lots of open-coded functions to find a clock source,
selector and multiplier.  Now there are both v2 and v3, so six
variants.

This patch refactors the code to use a common helper for the main
loop, and define each validator function for each target.
There is no functional change.
