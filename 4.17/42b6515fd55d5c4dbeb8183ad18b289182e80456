media: ngene: add support for Sony CXD28xx-based DuoFlex modules

Recognize (probe) and support (attach) all Sony CXD28xx based DuoFlex
addon modules/cards, namely the DuoFlex CT2 (CXD2837), ISDB-T (CXD2838),
C2T2 (CXD2843) and C2T2I (CXD2854). Since all these modules are equipped
with a MachXO2 interface, that support is required for the hardware to
work. This functionality utilises the auxiliary cxd2841er and tda18212
drivers.

This also adds autoselection (if MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT) of the CXD2841ER
demod driver to Kconfig. The __maybe_unused annotation can now be removed
from the xo2names array.
