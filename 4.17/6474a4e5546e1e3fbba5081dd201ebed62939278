PCI: endpoint: Make sure that BAR_5 does not have 64-bit flag set when clearing

Since a 64-bit BAR consists of a BAR pair, and since there is no
BAR after BAR_5, BAR_5 cannot be 64-bits wide.

This sanity check is done in pci_epc_clear_bar(), so that we don't need
to do this sanity check in all epc->ops->clear_bar() implementations.
