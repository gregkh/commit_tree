i40evf: use __dev_[um]c_sync routines in .set_rx_mode

Similar to changes done to the PF driver in commit 6622f5cdbaf3 ("i40e:
make use of __dev_uc_sync and __dev_mc_sync"), replace our
home-rolled method for updating the internal status of MAC filters with
__dev_uc_sync and __dev_mc_sync.

These new functions use internal state within the netdev struct in order
to efficiently break the question of "which filters in this list need to
be added or removed" into singular "add this filter" and "delete this
filter" requests.

This vastly improves our handling of .set_rx_mode especially with large
number of MAC filters being added to the device, and even results in
a simpler .set_rx_mode handler.

Under some circumstances, such as when attached to a bridge, we may
receive a request to delete our own permanent address. Prevent deletion
of this address during i40evf_addr_unsync so that we don't accidentally
stop receiving traffic.
