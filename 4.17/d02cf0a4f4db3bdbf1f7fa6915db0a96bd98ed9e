drm/i915: Make use of indexed write GMBUS feature

This patch enables the indexed write feature of the GMBUS to concatenate
2 consecutive messages into one. The criteria for an indexed write is
that both messages are writes, the first is length == 1, and the second
is length > 0. The first message is sent out by the GMBUS as the slave
command, and the second one is sent via the GMBUS FIFO as usual.

Changes in v3:
- Added to series
Changes in v4:
- Combine indexed reads and writes (Ville)
Changes in v5:
- checkpatch whitespace nits
Changes in v6:
- None
