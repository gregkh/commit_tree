blk-mq: count allocated but not started requests in iostats inflight

In the legacy block case, we increment the counter right after we
allocate the request, not when the driver handles it. In both the legacy
and blk-mq cases, part_inc_in_flight() is called from
blk_account_io_start() right after we've allocated the request. blk-mq
only considers requests started requests as inflight, but this is
inconsistent with the legacy definition and the intention in the code.
This removes the started condition and instead counts all allocated
requests.
