drm/i915: Wrap engine->schedule in RCU locks for set-wedge protection

Similar to the staging around handling of engine->submit_request, we
need to stop adding to the execlists->queue prior to calling
engine->cancel_requests. cancel_requests will move requests from the
queue onto the timeline, so if we add a request onto the queue after that
point, it will be lost.
