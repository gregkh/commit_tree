media: s3c-camif: fix out-of-bounds array access

While experimenting with older compiler versions, I ran
into a warning that no longer shows up on gcc-4.8 or newer:

drivers/media/platform/s3c-camif/camif-capture.c: In function '__camif_subdev_try_format':
drivers/media/platform/s3c-camif/camif-capture.c:1265:25: error: array subscript is below array bounds

This is an off-by-one bug, leading to an access before the start of the
array, while newer compilers silently assume this undefined behavior
cannot happen and leave the loop at index 0 if no other entry matches.

As Sylvester explains, we actually need to ensure that the
value is within the range, so this reworks the loop to be
easier to parse correctly, and an additional check to fall
back on the first format value for any unexpected input.

I found an existing gcc bug for it and added a reduced version
of the function there.
