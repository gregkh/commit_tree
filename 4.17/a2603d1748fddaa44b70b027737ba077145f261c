media: i2c: max2175: use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Add suffix LL to constant 2 in order to give the compiler complete
information about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice that this
constant is used in a context that expects an expression of type
s64 (64 bits, signed).

The expression 2 * (clock_rate - abs_nco_freq) is currently being
evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic.
