net: stmmac: set MSS for each tx DMA channel

The DMA engine in dwmac4 can segment a large TSO packet to several
smaller packets of (max) size Maximum Segment Size (MSS).

The DMA engine fetches and saves the MSS via a context descriptor.

This context decriptor has to be provided to each tx DMA channel.
To ensure that this is done, move struct member mss from stmmac_priv
to stmmac_tx_queue.

stmmac_reset_queues_param() now also resets mss, together with other
queue parameters, so reset of mss value can be removed from
stmmac_resume().

init_dma_tx_desc_rings() now also resets mss, together with other
queue parameters, so reset of mss value can be removed from
stmmac_open().

This fixes tx queue timeouts for dwmac4, with DT property
snps,tx-queues-to-use > 1, when running iperf3 with multiple threads.
