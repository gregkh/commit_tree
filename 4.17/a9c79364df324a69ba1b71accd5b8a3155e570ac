phylink,sfp: negotiate interface format with MAC

Negotiate the interface format with the MAC rather than requiring it to
be a fixed type specified solely by the SFP module.  This allows modules
that can work with several different interface signalling formats to
select a format compatible with the MAC - for example, a Fiber module
supporing Gigabit ethernet and faster connected to a Gigabit only MAC
needs to select the 1000BASE-X mode.
