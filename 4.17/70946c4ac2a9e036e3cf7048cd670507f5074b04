evm: check for remount ro in progress before writing

EVM might update the evm xattr while the VFS performs a remount to
readonly mode. This is not properly checked for, additionally check
the s_readonly_remount superblock flag before writing.

The bug can for example be observed with UBIFS. UBIFS checks the free
space on the device before and after a remount. With EVM enabled the
free space sometimes differs between both checks.
