perf evsel: Disable write_backward for leader sampling group events

.. and other related fields that do not need to be enabled
for events that have sampling leader.

It fixes the perf top usage Ingo reported broken:

  # perf top -e '{cycles,msr/aperf/}:S'

The 'msr/aperf/' event is configured for write_back sampling, which is
not allowed by the MSR PMU, so it fails to create the event.

Adjusting related attr test.
