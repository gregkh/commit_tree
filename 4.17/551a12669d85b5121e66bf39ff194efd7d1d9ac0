eeprom: at24: refactor at24_probe()

The code in at24_probe() is pretty mangled. It can be cleaned up a bit
by doing things one by one.

Let's group the code by logic: parse and verify pdata, initialize the
regmap, allocate and fill the fields of at24_data, allocate dummy i2c
devices, initialize pm & register with nvmem.
