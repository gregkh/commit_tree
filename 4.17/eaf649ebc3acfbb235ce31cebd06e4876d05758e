mm: swap: clean up swap readahead

When I see recent change of swap readahead, I am very unhappy about
current code structure which diverges two swap readahead algorithm in
do_swap_page.  This patch is to clean it up.

Main motivation is that fault handler doesn't need to be aware of
readahead algorithms but just should call swapin_readahead.

As first step, this patch cleans up a little bit but not perfect (I just
separate for review easier) so next patch will make the goal complete.
