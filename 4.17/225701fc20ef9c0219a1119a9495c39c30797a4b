drm/i915/icl: Set graphics mode register for gen11

This patch clears a single bit. The bit is 0 by default but expected
not to be set. Explicitly clearing the bit in this patch is intended
to indicate some thinking has occurred, and that we want this bit
cleared and we are not just excepting the default value.

We also stop setting GFX_RUN_LIST_ENABLE, which is correct since that
bit is gone.

v2 (from Paulo): fix indentation.
v3: Changed GEN check to >= 11. Corrected author name.
v4 (from Paulo): improve commit message (Daniele).
