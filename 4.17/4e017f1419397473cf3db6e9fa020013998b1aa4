dt-bindings: ifc: Fix the unit address format in the examples

DTC warnings will be seen if these examples are used in a real dts file
due to a mismatch in the unit address notation.

Align the unit address notation to what is done in the real dts files
as per commit f81d7af79575 ("arm64: dts: fsl: fix ifc simple-bus unit
address format warnings")
