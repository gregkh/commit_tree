drm/amdkfd: Aperture setup for dGPUs

Set up the GPUVM aperture for SVM (shared virtual memory) that allows
sharing a part of virtual address space between GPUs and CPUs.

Report the size of the GPUVM aperture that is supported by KGD accurately.

The low part of the GPUVM aperture is reserved for kernel use. This is
for kernel-allocated buffers that are only accessed on the GPU:
- CWSR trap handler
- IB for submitting commands in user-mode context from kernel mode
