sfc: ARFS filter IDs

Associate an arbitrary ID with each ARFS filter, allowing to properly query
 for expiry.  The association is maintained in a hash table, which is
 protected by a spinlock.

v3: fix build warnings when CONFIG_RFS_ACCEL is disabled (thanks lkp-robot).
v2: fixed uninitialised variable (thanks davem and lkp-robot).

Fixes: 3af0f34290f6 ("sfc: replace asynchronous filter operations")
