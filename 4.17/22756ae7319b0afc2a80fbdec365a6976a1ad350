media: rc: don't mark IR decoders default y

I usually update my config with make oldconfig and pressing return,
trusting that whoever updates Kconfig sets sensible defaults.

But my recent kernels ended up with all kinds of IR decoders
built in that are not used by anything because they are all
marked with default y.

default y should only be set for something that prevents
booting on common systems, never for some random weirdo
driver feature like this.

Remove all the "default y" in drivers/media/rc/Kconfig
