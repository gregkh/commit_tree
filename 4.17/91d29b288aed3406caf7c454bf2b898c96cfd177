perf intel-pt: Fix timestamp following overflow

timestamp_insn_cnt is used to estimate the timestamp based on the number of
instructions since the last known timestamp.

If the estimate is not accurate enough decoding might not be correctly
synchronized with side-band events causing more trace errors.

However there are always timestamps following an overflow, so the
estimate is not needed and can indeed result in more errors.

Suppress the estimate by setting timestamp_insn_cnt to zero.
