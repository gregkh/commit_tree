dm: remove fmode_t argument from .prepare_ioctl hook

Use the fmode_t that is passed to dm_blk_ioctl() rather than
inconsistently (varies across targets) drop it on the floor by
overriding it with the fmode_t stored in 'struct dm_dev'.

All the persistent reservation functions weren't using the fmode_t they
got back from .prepare_ioctl so remove them.
