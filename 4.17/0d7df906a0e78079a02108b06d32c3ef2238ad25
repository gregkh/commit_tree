netfilter: x_tables: ensure last rule in base chain matches underflow/policy

Harmless from kernel point of view, but again iptables assumes that
this is true when decoding ruleset coming from kernel.

If a (syzkaller generated) ruleset doesn't have the underflow/policy
stored as the last rule in the base chain, then iptables will abort()
because it doesn't find the chain policy.

libiptc assumes that the policy is the last rule in the basechain, which
is only true for iptables-generated rulesets.

Unfortunately this needs code duplication -- the functions need the
struct layout of the rule head, but that is different for
ip/ip6/arptables.

NB: pr_warn could be pr_debug but in case this break rulesets somehow its
useful to know why blob was rejected.
