afs: Fix the handling of an unfound server in CM operations

If the client cache manager operations that need the server record
(CB.Callback, CB.InitCallBackState, and CB.InitCallBackState3) can't find
the server record, they abort the call from the file server with
RX_CALL_DEAD when they should return okay.

Fixes: c35eccb1f614 ("[AFS]: Implement the CB.InitCallBackState3 operation.")
