drm/i915/gvt: Rework shadow graphic memory management code

This is a big one and the GVT shadow graphic memory management code is
heavily refined. The new code is more straightforward with less code.

The struct intel_vgpu_mm is restructured to be clearly defined, use
accurate names and some of the original fields are removed which are
really redundant.

Now we only manage ppgtt mm object with mm->ppgtt_mm.lru_list. No need
to mix ppgtt and ggtt together, since one vGPU only has one ggtt object.

v4: Don't invoke ppgtt_free_all_shadow_page before intel_vgpu_destroy_all_ppgtt_mm.
v3: Add GVT_RING_CTX_NR_PDPS to avoid confusing about the PDPs.
v2: Split some changes into small standalone patches.
