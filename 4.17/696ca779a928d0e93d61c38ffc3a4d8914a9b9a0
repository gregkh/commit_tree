KVM: x86: fix #UD address of failed Hyper-V hypercalls

If the hypercall was called from userspace or real mode, KVM injects #UD
and then advances RIP, so it looks like #UD was caused by the following
instruction.  This probably won't cause more than confusion, but could
give an unexpected access to guest OS' instruction emulator.

Also, refactor the code to count hv hypercalls that were handled by the
virt userspace.
