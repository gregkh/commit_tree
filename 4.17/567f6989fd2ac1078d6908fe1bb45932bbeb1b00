tracing: Embed replace_filter_string() helper function

The replace_filter_string() frees the current string and then copies a given
string. But in the two locations that it was used, the allocation happened
right after the filter was allocated (nothing to replace). There's no need
for this to be a helper function. Embedding the allocation in the two places
where it was called will make changing the code in the future easier.

Also make the variable consistent (always use "filter_string" as the name,
as it was used in one instance as "filter_str")
