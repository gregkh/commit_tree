powerpc: iomap.c: introduce io{read|write}64_{lo_hi|hi_lo}

These functions will be introduced into the generic iomap.c so they
can deal with PIO accesses in hi-lo/lo-hi variants. Thus, the powerpc
version of iomap.c will need to provide the same functions even
though, in this arch, they are identical to the regular
io{read|write}64 functions.
