watchdog: aspeed: Fix translation of reset mode to ctrl register

Assert RESET_SYSTEM bit for any reset and set MODE field from reset
type.

The watchdog control register has a RESET_SYSTEM bit that is really
closer to activate a reset, and RESET_SYSTEM_MODE field that chooses
how much to reset.

Before this patch, a node without these optional property would do a
SOC reset, but a node with properties requesting a cpu or SOC reset
would do nothing and a node requesting a system reset would do a
SOC reset.
