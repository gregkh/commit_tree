netfilter: x_tables: check standard verdicts in core

Userspace must provide a valid verdict to the standard target.

The verdict can be either a jump (signed int > 0), or a return code.

Allowed return codes are either RETURN (pop from stack), NF_ACCEPT, DROP
and QUEUE (latter is allowed for legacy reasons).

Jump offsets (verdict > 0) are checked in more detail later on when
loop-detection is performed.
