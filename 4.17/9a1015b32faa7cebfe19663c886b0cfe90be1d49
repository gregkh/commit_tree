proc: fix /proc/loadavg regression

Commit 95846ecf9dac ("pid: replace pid bitmap implementation with IDR
API") changed last field of /proc/loadavg (last pid allocated) to be off
by one:

	# unshare -p -f --mount-proc cat /proc/loadavg
	0.00 0.00 0.00 1/60 2	<===

It should be 1 after first fork into pid namespace.

This is formally a regression but given how useless this field is I
don't think anyone is affected.

Bug was found by /proc testsuite!
