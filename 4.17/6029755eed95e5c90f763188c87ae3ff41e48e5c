powerpc: Fix deadlock with multiple calls to smp_send_stop

smp_send_stop can lock up the IPI path for any subsequent calls,
because the receiving CPUs spin in their handler function. This
started becoming a problem with the addition of an smp_send_stop
call in the reboot path, because panics can reboot after doing
their own smp_send_stop.

The NMI IPI variant was fixed with ac61c11566 ("powerpc: Fix
smp_send_stop NMI IPI handling"), which leaves the smp_call_function
variant.

This is fixed by having smp_send_stop only ever do the
smp_call_function once. This is a bit less robust than the NMI IPI
fix, because any other call to smp_call_function after smp_send_stop
could deadlock, but that has always been the case, and it was not
been a problem before.
