mm, pagemap: fix swap offset value for PMD migration entry

The swap offset reported by /proc/<pid>/pagemap may be not correct for
PMD migration entries.  If addr passed into pagemap_pmd_range() isn't
aligned with PMD start address, the swap offset reported doesn't
reflect this.  And in the loop to report information of each sub-page,
the swap offset isn't increased accordingly as that for PFN.

This may happen after opening /proc/<pid>/pagemap and seeking to a page
whose address doesn't align with a PMD start address.  I have verified
this with a simple test program.

BTW: migration swap entries have PFN information, do we need to restrict
whether to show them?
