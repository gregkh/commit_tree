fw_cfg: handle fw_cfg_read_blob() error

fw_cfg_read_blob() may fail, but does not return error. This may lead
to surprising behaviours, like populating zero file entries (in
register_file() or during read). Return an error if ACPI locking
failed. Also, the following DMA read/write extension will add more
error paths that should be handled appropriately.
