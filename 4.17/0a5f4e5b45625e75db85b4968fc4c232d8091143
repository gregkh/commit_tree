mm/free_pcppages_bulk: do not hold lock when picking pages to free

When freeing a batch of pages from Per-CPU-Pages(PCP) back to buddy, the
zone->lock is held and then pages are chosen from PCP's migratetype
list.  While there is actually no need to do this 'choose part' under
lock since it's PCP pages, the only CPU that can touch them is us and
irq is also disabled.

Moving this part outside could reduce lock held time and improve
performance.  Test with will-it-scale/page_fault1 full load:

  kernel      Broadwell(2S)  Skylake(2S)   Broadwell(4S)  Skylake(4S)
  v4.16-rc2+  9034215        7971818       13667135       15677465
  this patch  9536374 +5.6%  8314710 +4.3% 14070408 +3.0% 16675866 +6.4%

What the test does is: starts $nr_cpu processes and each will repeatedly
do the following for 5 minutes:

 - mmap 128M anonymouse space

 - write access to that space

 - munmap.

The score is the aggregated iteration.
