mailbox: Add support for Hi3660 mailbox

Hi3660 mailbox controller is used to send message within multiple
processors, MCU, HIFI, etc.  It supports 32 mailbox channels and every
channel can only be used for single transferring direction.  Once the
channel is enabled, it needs to specify the destination interrupt and
acknowledge interrupt, these two interrupt vectors are used to create
the connection between the mailbox and interrupt controllers.

The data transferring supports two modes, one is named as "automatic
acknowledge" mode so after send message the kernel doesn't need to wait
for acknowledge from remote and directly return; there have another mode
is to rely on handling interrupt for acknowledge.

This commit is for initial version driver, which only supports
"automatic acknowledge" mode to support CPU clock, which is the only
one consumer to use mailbox and has been verified.  Later may enhance
this driver for interrupt mode (e.g. for supporting HIFI).
