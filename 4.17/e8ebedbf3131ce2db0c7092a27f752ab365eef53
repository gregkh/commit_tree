KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Return error from h_set_dabr() on POWER9

POWER7 compat mode guests can use h_set_dabr on POWER9. POWER9 should
use the DAWR but since it's disabled there we can't.

This returns H_UNSUPPORTED on a h_set_dabr() on POWER9 where the DAWR
is disabled.

Current Linux guests ignore this error, so they will silently not get
the DAWR (sigh). The same error code is being used by POWERVM in this
case.
