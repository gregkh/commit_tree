staging: lustre: replace simple cases of l_wait_event() with wait_event().

When the lwi arg is full of zeros, l_wait_event() behaves almost
identically to the standard wait_event_idle() interface, so use that
instead.

l_wait_event() uses TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, but blocks all signals.
wait_event_idle() uses the new TASK_IDLE and so avoids adding
to the load average without needing to block signals.

In one case, wait_event_idle_exclusive() is needed.

Also remove all l_wait_condition*() macros which were short-cuts
for setting lwi to {0}.
