net/sonic: Clean up and modernize log messages

Add missing printk severity levels by adopting pr_foo() calls for the
platform_driver and dev_foo() calls for the nubus_driver.
Avoid KERN_CONT usage as per advice from checkpatch.
Avoid #ifdef around printk calls.
Don't log driver probe messages after calling register_netdev().
