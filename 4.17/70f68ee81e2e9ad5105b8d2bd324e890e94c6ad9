fs: add ksys_sync() helper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_sync()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the
sys_sync() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function
is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it
uses the same calling convention as sys_sync().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
