serial: mvebu-uart: fix tx lost characters

Fixes missing characters on kernel console at low baud rates (i.e.9600).
The driver should poll TX_RDY or TX_FIFO_EMP instead of TX_EMP to ensure
that the transmitter holding register (THR) is ready to receive a new byte.

TX_EMP tells us when it is possible to send a break sequence via
SND_BRK_SEQ. While this also indicates that both the THR and the TSR are
empty, it does not guarantee that a new byte can be written just yet.
