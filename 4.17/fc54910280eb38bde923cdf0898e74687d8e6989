Bluetooth: btusb: Only check needs_reset_resume DMI table for QCA rome chipsets

Jeremy Cline correctly points out in rhbz#1514836 that a device where the
QCA rome chipset needs the USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME quirk, may also ship
with a different wifi/bt chipset in some configurations.

If that is the case then we are needlessly penalizing those other chipsets
with a reset-resume quirk, typically causing 0.4W extra power use because
this disables runtime-pm.

This commit moves the DMI table check to a btusb_check_needs_reset_resume()
helper (so that we can easily also call it for other chipsets) and calls
this new helper only for QCA_ROME chipsets for now.
