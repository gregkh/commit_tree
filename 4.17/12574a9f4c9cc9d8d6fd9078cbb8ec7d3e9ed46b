ovl: consistent i_ino for non-samefs with xino

When overlay layers are not all on the same fs, but all inode numbers
of underlying fs do not use the high 'xino' bits, overlay st_ino values
are constant and persistent.

In that case, set i_ino value to the same value as st_ino for nfsd
readdirplus validator.
