drm/i915: Add display WA #1175 for planes ending close to right screen edge

As described in the WA on GLK and CNL planes on the right edge of the
screen that have less than 4 pixels visible from the beginning of the
plane to the edge of the screen can cause FIFO underflow and display
corruption.

On GLK/CNL I could trigger the problem only if the plane was at the same
time also aligned to the top edge of the screen (after clipping) and
there were exactly 2 pixels visible from the start of the plane to the
right edge of the screen (so couldn't trigger it with 1 or 3 pixels
visible). Nevertheless, to be sure, I also applied the WA for these cases.

I also couldn't see any problem with the cursor plane and later Art
confirmed that it's not affected, so the WA is applied only for the
other plane types.

v2:
- Use -ERANGE instead of -EINVAL. (Chris)
