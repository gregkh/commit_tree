sctp: add sockopt SCTP_AUTH_DEACTIVATE_KEY

This patch is to add sockopt SCTP_AUTH_DEACTIVATE_KEY, as described in
section 8.3.4 of RFC6458.

This set option indicates that the application will no longer send user
messages using the indicated key identifier.

Note that RFC requires that only deactivated keys that are no longer used
by an association can be deleted, but for the backward compatibility, it
is not to check deactivated when deleting or replacing one sh_key.
