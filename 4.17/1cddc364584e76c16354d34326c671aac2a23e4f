ARM: OMAP2+: Cleanup omap2_spi_dev_attr and other legacy data

The omap2_spi_dev_attr data was used to supply instance-specific
data for legacy non-DT devices. The SPI legacy device support
including the usage of the hwmod class revision data has been
dropped in commit 6f3ab009a178 ("ARM: OMAP2+: Remove unused legacy
code for device init") and this data is therefore no longer needed.
So, cleanup the structure and all the associated data in various
hwmod data files.
