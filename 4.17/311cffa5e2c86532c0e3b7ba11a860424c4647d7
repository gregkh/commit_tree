staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Add DPNI version check

The DPAA2 Ethernet driver assumes the DPNI objects that it
uses to build network interfaces have a minimum supported
API version, but until now it did nothing to enforce this
requirement.

Add a check at probe time to make sure the DPNI object is
compatible with the set of MC commands we intend to use
on it.
