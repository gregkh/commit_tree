media: intel-ipu3: cio2: Disable and sync irq before stream off

This is to avoid pending interrupts to be handled during
stream off, in which case, the ready buffer will be removed
from buffer list, thus not all buffers can be returned to VB2
as expected. Disable CIO2 irq at cio2_hw_exit() so no new
interrupts are generated.
