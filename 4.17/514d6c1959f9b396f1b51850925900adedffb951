bpf: Document sockmap '-target bpf' requirement for PROG_TYPE_SK_MSG

BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_MSG programs use a 'void *' for both data and the
data_end pointers. Additionally, the verifier ensures that every
accesses into the values is a __u64 read. This correctly maps on
to the BPF 64-bit architecture.

However, to ensure that when building on 32bit architectures that
clang uses correct types the '-target bpf' option _must_ be
specified. To make this clear add a note to the Documentation.
