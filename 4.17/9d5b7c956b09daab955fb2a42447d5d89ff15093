mm: add ksys_fadvise64_64() helper; remove in-kernel call to sys_fadvise64_64()

Using the ksys_fadvise64_64() helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel
calls to the sys_fadvise64_64() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that
this function is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In
particular, it uses the same calling convention as ksys_fadvise64_64().

Some compat stubs called sys_fadvise64(), which then just passed through
the arguments to sys_fadvise64_64(). Get rid of this indirection, and call
ksys_fadvise64_64() directly.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
