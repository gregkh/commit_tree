ASoC: topology: Fix kcontrol name string handling

Fix the topology kcontrol string handling so that string pointer
references are strdup()ed instead of being copied. This fixes issues
with kcontrol templates on the stack or ones that are freed. Remember
and free the strings too when topology is unloaded.
