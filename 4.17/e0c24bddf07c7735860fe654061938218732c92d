fsi: master: Clarify master lifetimes & fix use-after-free in hub master

Once we call fsi_master_unregister, the core will put_device,
potentially freeing the hub master. This change adds a comment
explaining the lifetime of an allocated fsi_master.

We then add a reference from the driver to the hub master, so it stays
around until we've finished ->remove().
