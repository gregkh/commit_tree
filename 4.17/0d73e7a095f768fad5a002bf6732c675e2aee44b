drm/i915: Mark the device as wedged from the beginning of set-wedged

Reduce the window of opportunity for set-wedged being called
concurrently with reset (after i915_reset() has performed the
i915_gem_unset_wedged()) by moving the set_bit(I915_WEDGED) to before we
complete the inflight requests. When i915_reset() is being blocked on a
request, such completion may allow it to start and beginning resetting
the GPU before i915_gem_set_wedged() has finished (and so before
set-wedge will have marked the device as wedged). As such,
i915_gem_init_hw() may see a wedged device even from inside
i915_reset().
