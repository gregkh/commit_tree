ice: Set rq_last_status when cleaning rq

Prior to this commit, the rq_last_status was only set when hardware
responded with an error. This leads to rq_last_status being invalid
in the future when hardware eventually responds without error. This
commit resolves the issue by unconditionally setting rq_last_status
with the value returned in the descriptor.

Fixes: 940b61af02f4 ("ice: Initialize PF and setup miscellaneous
interrupt")
