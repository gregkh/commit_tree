dm bufio: don't embed a bio in the dm_buffer structure

The bio structure consumes a substantial part of dm_buffer.  The bio
structure is only needed when doing I/O on the buffer, thus we don't
have to embed it in the buffer.

Allocate the bio structure only when doing I/O.

We don't need to create a bio_set because, in case of allocation
failure, dm-bufio falls back to using dm-io (which keeps its own
bio_set).
