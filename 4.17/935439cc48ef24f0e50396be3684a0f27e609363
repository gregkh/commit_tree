tipc: merge two lists in struct publication

The size of struct publication can be reduced further. Membership in
lists 'nodesub_list' and 'local_list' is mutually exlusive, in that
remote publications use the former and local publications the latter.
We replace the two lists with one single, named 'binding_node' which
reflects what it really is.
