KVM: arm/arm64: Move vcpu_load call after kvm_vcpu_first_run_init

Moving the call to vcpu_load() in kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run() to after
we've called kvm_vcpu_first_run_init() simplifies some of the vgic and
there is also no need to do vcpu_load() for things such as handling the
immediate_exit flag.
