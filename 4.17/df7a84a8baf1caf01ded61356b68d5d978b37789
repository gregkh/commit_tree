video: fbdev: vermilion: use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Cast _pitch_ to u64 in order to give the compiler complete information
about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice that this variable is
being used in a context that expects an expression of type u64
(64 bits, unsigned).

The expression pitch * var->yres_virtual is currently being evaluated
using 32-bit arithmetic and the result of the operation is being stored
into variable mem, which is a variable of type u64. Based on that,
chances are there is a potential integer overflow as a result of the
operation.
