x86/mm/encrypt: Simplify sme_populate_pgd() and sme_populate_pgd_large()

sme_populate_pgd() and sme_populate_pgd_large() operate on the identity
mapping, which means they want virtual addresses to be equal to physical
one, without PAGE_OFFSET shift.

We also need to avoid paravirtualization call there.

Getting this done is tricky. We cannot use usual page table helpers.
It forces us to open-code a lot of things. It makes code ugly and hard
to modify.

We can get it work with the page table helpers, but it requires few
preprocessor tricks.

  - Define __pa() and __va() to be compatible with identity mapping.

  - Undef CONFIG_PARAVIRT and CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS before including
    any file. This way we can avoid paravirtualization calls.

Now we can user normal page table helpers just fine.
