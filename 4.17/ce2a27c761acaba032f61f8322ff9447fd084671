net: mvpp2: Simplify MAC filtering function parameters

The mvpp2_prs_mac_da_accept function takes into parameter both the
struct representing the controller and the port id. This is meaningful
when we want to create TCAM entries for non-initialized ports, but in
this case we expect the port to be initialized before starting adding or
removing MAC addresses to the per-port filter.

This commit changes the function so that it takes struct mvpp2_port as
a parameter instead.
