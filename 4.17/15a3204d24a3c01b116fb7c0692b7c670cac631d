powerpc/64s: Set assembler machine type to POWER4

Rather than override the machine type in .S code (which can hide wrong
or ambiguous code generation for the target), set the type to power4
for all assembly.

This also means we need to be careful not to build power4-only code
when we're not building for Book3S, such as the "power7" versions of
copyuser/page/memcpy.
