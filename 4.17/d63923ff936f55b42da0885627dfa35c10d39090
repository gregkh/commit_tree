staging: ccree: fixed pointer signedness warnings.

The driver uses a mixture of signed and unsigned integer variables for
holding arrays lengths and indices, which gives rise to the following
sparse warnings when the addresses of signed variables are passed to
functions expecting pointers to unsigned integers:

This patch fixes those warnings by converting those signed variables to
unsigned as follows:

  * changed the types of a number of index and length variables from
    signed to unsigned integer types.

  * changed the return-types of a couple of functions that return length
    values which are assigned to one of these variables from signed to
    unsigned integer types.
