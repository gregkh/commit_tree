net: Convert iptable_filter_net_ops

These pernet_operations register and unregister
net::ipv4.iptable_filter table. Since there are
no packets in-flight at the time of exit method
is working, iptables rules should not be touched.
Also, pernet_operations should not send ipv4
packets each other. So, it's safe to mark them
async.
