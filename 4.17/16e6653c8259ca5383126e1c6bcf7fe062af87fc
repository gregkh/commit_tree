ixgbe: fix parsing of TC actions for HW offload

The previous code was optimistic, accepting the offload of whole action
chain when there was a single known action (drop/redirect). This results
in offloading a rule which should not be offloaded, because its behavior
cannot be reproduced in the hardware.

For example:

$ tc filter add dev eno1 parent ffff: protocol ip \
    u32 ht 800: order 1 match tcp src 42 FFFF \
    action mirred egress mirror dev enp1s16 pipe \
    drop

The controller is unable to mirror the packet to a VF, but still
offloads the rule by dropping the packet.

Change the approach of the function to a pessimistic one, rejecting the
chain when an unknown action is found. This is better suited for future
extensions.

Note that both recognized actions always return TC_ACT_SHOT, therefore
it is safe to ignore actions behind them.
