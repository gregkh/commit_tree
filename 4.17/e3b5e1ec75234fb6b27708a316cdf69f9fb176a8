Revert "netfilter: x_tables: ensure last rule in base chain matches underflow/policy"

This reverts commit 0d7df906a0e78079a02108b06d32c3ef2238ad25.

Valdis Kletnieks reported that xtables is broken in linux-next since
0d7df906a0e78  ("netfilter: x_tables: ensure last rule in base chain
matches underflow/policy"), as kernel rejects the (well-formed) ruleset:

[   64.402790] ip6_tables: last base chain position 1136 doesn't match underflow 1344 (hook 1)

mark_source_chains is not the correct place for such a check, as it
terminates evaluation of a chain once it sees an unconditional verdict
(following rules are known to be unreachable). It seems preferrable to
fix libiptc instead, so remove this check again.
