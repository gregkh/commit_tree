ipc: add msgctl syscall/compat_syscall wrappers

Provide ksys_msgctl() and compat_ksys_msgctl() wrappers to avoid in-kernel
calls to these syscalls. The ksys_ prefix denotes that these functions are
meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscalls. In particular, they use
the same calling convention as sys_msgctl() and compat_sys_msgctl().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
