scsi: lpfc: Fix PRLI handling when topology type changes

The lpfc driver does not discover a target when the topology changes
from switched-fabric to direct-connect. The target rejects the PRLI from
the initiator in direct-connect as the driver is using the old S_ID from
the switched topology.

The driver was inappropriately clearing the VP bit to register the VPI,
which is what is associated with the S_ID.

Fix by leaving the VP bit set (it was set earlier) and as the VFI is
being re-registered, set the UPDT bit.
