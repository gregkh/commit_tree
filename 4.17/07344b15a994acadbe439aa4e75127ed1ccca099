x86/boot: Fix SEV boot failure from change to __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT

In arch/x86/boot/compressed/kaslr_64.c, CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT support was
initially #undef'd to support SME with minimal effort.  When support for
SEV was added, the #undef remained and some minimal support for setting the
encryption bit was added for building identity mapped pagetable entries.

Commit b83ce5ee9147 ("x86/mm/64: Make __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT always 52")
changed __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT from 46 to 52 in support of 5-level paging.
This change resulted in SEV guests failing to boot because the encryption
bit was no longer being automatically masked out.  The compressed boot
path now requires sme_me_mask to be defined in order for the pagetable
functions, such as pud_present(), to properly mask out the encryption bit
(currently bit 47) when evaluating pagetable entries.

Add an sme_me_mask variable in arch/x86/boot/compressed/mem_encrypt.S,
which is set when SEV is active, delete the #undef CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT
from arch/x86/boot/compressed/kaslr_64.c and use sme_me_mask when building
the identify mapped pagetable entries.
