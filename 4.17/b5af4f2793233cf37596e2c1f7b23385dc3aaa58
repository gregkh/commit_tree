powerpc: Add CPU feature bits for TM bug workarounds on POWER9 v2.2

This adds a CPU feature bit which is set for POWER9 "Nimbus" DD2.2
processors which will be used to enable the hypervisor to assist
hardware with the handling of checkpointed register values while the
CPU is in suspend state, in order to work around hardware bugs.  The
hardware assistance for these workarounds introduced a new hardware
bug relating to the XER[SO] bit.  We add a separate feature bit for
this bug in case future chips fix it while still requiring the
hypervisor assistance with suspend state.

When the dt_cpu_ftrs subsystem is in use, the software assistance can
be enabled using a "tm-suspend-hypervisor-assist" node in the device
tree, and a "tm-suspend-xer-so-bug" node enables the workarounds for
the XER[SO] bug.  In the absence of such nodes, a quirk enables both
for POWER9 "Nimbus" DD2.2 processors.
