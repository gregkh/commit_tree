ovl: Do not check for redirect if this is last layer

If we are looking in last layer, then there should not be any need to
process redirect. redirect information is used only for lookup in next
lower layer and there is no more lower layer to look into. So no need
to process redirects.

IOW, ignore redirects on lowest layer.
