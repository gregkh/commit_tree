slimbus: Fix out-of-bounds access in slim_slicesize()

With gcc-4.1.2:

    slimbus/messaging.c: In function ‘slim_slicesize’:
    slimbus/messaging.c:186: warning: statement with no effect

Indeed, clamp() is a macro not operating in-place, but returning the
clamped value.  Hence the value is not clamped at all, which may lead to
an out-of-bounds access.

Fix this by assigning the clamped value.
