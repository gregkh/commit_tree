drm/i915/execlists: Remove the ring advancement under preemption

Load an empty ringbuffer for preemption, ignoring the lite-restore
workaround as we know the preempt context is always idle before preemption.

Note that after some digging by Michal Winiarski, we found that
RING_HEAD is no longer being updated (due to inhibiting context save
restore) so this patch is already in effect!
