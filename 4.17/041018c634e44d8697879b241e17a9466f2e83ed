nvme_fc: io timeout should defer abort to ctrl reset

The current nvme_fc code, when an io times out, will abort the io
on the fc link, then call the error recovery routine to reset the
controller. It is during the reset of the controller that the
transport will wait for all ios to be aborted before sending a
Disconnect LS to the target.

However, the reset routine only waits for the io which it generates
the abort for to complete. Any io that was aborted just prior to the
reset isn't in it's list to wait for. Thus the Disconnect is getting
sent before the aborts have completed.

Correct by removing the abort in the timeout handler. The reset will
generate the abort. At that point the timeout handler can be simplified
to request the reset (via the error handler) and restart the timeout
timer.

Also fixes a small typo in a comment in the reset handler.
