io: define stronger ordering for the default readX() implementation

The default implementation of mapping readX() to __raw_readX() is wrong.
readX() has stronger ordering semantics. Compiler is allowed to reorder
__raw_readX() against the memory accesses following register read.

Use the previously defined __io_ar() and __io_br() macros to harden
code generation according to architecture support.
