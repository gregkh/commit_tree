i40e: Close client on suspend and restore client MSIx on resume

During suspend client MSIx vectors are freed while they are still
in use causing a crash on entering S3.

Fix this calling client close before freeing up its MSIx vectors.
Also update the client MSIx vectors on resume before client
open is called.

Fixes commit b980c0634fe5 ("i40e: shutdown all IRQs and disable MSI-X
when suspended")
