afs: Fix AFSFetchStatus decoder to provide OpenAFS compatibility

The OpenAFS server's RXAFS_InlineBulkStatus implementation has a bug
whereby if an error occurs on one of the vnodes being queried, then the
errorCode field is set correctly in the corresponding status, but the
interfaceVersion field is left unset.

Fix kAFS to deal with this by evaluating the AFSFetchStatus blob against
the following cases when called from FS.InlineBulkStatus delivery:

 (1) If InterfaceVersion == 0 then:

     (a) If errorCode != 0 then it indicates the abort code for the
         corresponding vnode.

     (b) If errorCode == 0 then the status record is invalid.

 (2) If InterfaceVersion == 1 then:

     (a) If errorCode != 0 then it indicates the abort code for the
         corresponding vnode.

     (b) If errorCode == 0 then the status record is valid and can be
     	 parsed.

 (3) If InterfaceVersion is anything else then the status record is
     invalid.
