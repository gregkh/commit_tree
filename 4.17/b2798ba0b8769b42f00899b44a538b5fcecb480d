KVM: X86: Choose qspinlock when dedicated physical CPUs are available

This patch uses the KVM_HINTS_DEDICATED performance hint, which is
provided by the hypervisor admin, to choose the qspinlock algorithm
when a dedicated physical CPU is available.

PV_DEDICATED = 1, PV_UNHALT = anything: default is qspinlock
PV_DEDICATED = 0, PV_UNHALT = 1: default is Hybrid PV queued/unfair lock
PV_DEDICATED = 0, PV_UNHALT = 0: default is tas
