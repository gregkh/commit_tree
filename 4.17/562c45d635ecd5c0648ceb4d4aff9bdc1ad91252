headers: Drop two #included headers from <linux/interrupt.h>

It seems that <linux/interrupt.h> does not need <linux/linkage.h>
nor <linux/preempt.h>.  8 kernels builds are successful without
these 2 headers (allmodconfig, allyesconfig, allnoconfig, and
tinyconfig on both i386 and x86_64).

<linux/interrupt.h> is #included 3875 times in 4.16-rc1, so this
reduces #include processing of these 2 files by a total of 7750 times.

Since I only tested x86 builds, this needs to be tested on other
$ARCHes as well.
