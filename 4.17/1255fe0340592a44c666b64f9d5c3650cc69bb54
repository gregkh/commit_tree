arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix RK3328 UART DMAs

Using a serial console on RK3328 provokes an error from
of_dma_request_slave_channel() since the UART nodes have a "dmas"
property but are missing the mandatory "dma-names" to go with it.

Replace the bogus "#dma-cells" - these UARTs are DMA channel consumers,
not providers - with the appropriate names instead. DMA still doesn't
actually work, since the PL330 driver doesn't quite implement everything
the 8250 driver demands, but at least it makes the DT correct.
