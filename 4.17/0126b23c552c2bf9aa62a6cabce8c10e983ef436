drm/vc4_validate: Remove VLA usage

In preparation to enabling -Wvla, remove VLA. In this particular
case use macro ARRAY_SIZE so the length of array _bo_ can be
computed at preprocessing time.

The use of stack Variable Length Arrays needs to be avoided, as they
can be a vector for stack exhaustion, which can be both a runtime bug
or a security flaw. Also, in general, as code evolves it is easy to
lose track of how big a VLA can get. Thus, we can end up having runtime
failures that are hard to debug.

Also, fixed as part of the directive to remove all VLAs from
the kernel: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/7/621
