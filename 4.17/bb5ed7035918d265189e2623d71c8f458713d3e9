KVM: arm/arm64: Get rid of vgic_elrsr

There is really no need to store the vgic_elrsr on the VGIC data
structures as the only need we have for the elrsr is to figure out if an
LR is inactive when we save the VGIC state upon returning from the
guest.  We can might as well store this in a temporary local variable.
