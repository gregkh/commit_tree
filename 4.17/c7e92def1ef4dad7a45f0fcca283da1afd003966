clk: mvebu: cp110: Fix clock tree representation

Thanks to new documentation, we have a better view of the clock tree.
There were few mistakes in the first version of this driver, the main one
being the parental link between the clocks. Actually the tree is more
flat that we though. Most of the IP blocks require two clocks: one for
the IP itself and one for accessing the registers, and unlike what we
wrote there is no link between these two clocks.

The other mistakes were about the name of the clocks: the root clock is
not the Audio PLL but the PLL0, and what we called the EIP clock is named
the x2 Core clock and is used by other IP block than the EIP ones.
