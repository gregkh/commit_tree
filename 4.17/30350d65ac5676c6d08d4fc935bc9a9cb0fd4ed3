tracing: Add variable support to hist triggers

Add support for saving the value of a current event's event field by
assigning it to a variable that can be read by a subsequent event.

The basic syntax for saving a variable is to simply prefix a unique
variable name not corresponding to any keyword along with an '=' sign
to any event field.

Both keys and values can be saved and retrieved in this way:

    # echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:vals=$ts0:ts0=common_timestamp ...
    # echo 'hist:timer_pid=common_pid:key=$timer_pid ...'

If a variable isn't a key variable or prefixed with 'vals=', the
associated event field will be saved in a variable but won't be summed
as a value:

    # echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:ts1=common_timestamp:...

Multiple variables can be assigned at the same time:

    # echo 'hist:keys=pid:vals=$ts0,$b,field2:ts0=common_timestamp,b=field1 ...

Multiple (or single) variables can also be assigned at the same time
using separate assignments:

    # echo 'hist:keys=pid:vals=$ts0:ts0=common_timestamp:b=field1:c=field2 ...

Variables set as above can be used by being referenced from another
event, as described in a subsequent patch.
