crypto: inside-secure - improve the skcipher token

The token used for encryption and decryption of skcipher algorithms sets
its stat field to "last packet". As it's a cipher only algorithm, there
is not hash operation and thus the "last hash" bit should be set to tell
the internal engine no hash operation should be performed.

This does not fix a bug, but improves the token definition to follow
exactly what's advised by the datasheet.
