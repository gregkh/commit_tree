sctp: clear the new asoc's stream outcnt in sctp_stream_update

When processing a duplicate cookie-echo chunk, sctp moves the new
temp asoc's stream out/in into the old asoc, and later frees this
new temp asoc.

But now after this move, the new temp asoc's stream->outcnt is not
cleared while stream->out is set to NULL, which would cause a same
crash as the one fixed in Commit 79d0895140e9 ("sctp: fix error
path in sctp_stream_init") when freeing this asoc later.

This fix is to clear this outcnt in sctp_stream_update.
