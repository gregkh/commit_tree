KVM: x86: Fix misleading comments on handling pending exceptions

The reason that exception.pending should block re-injection of
NMI/interrupt is not described correctly in comment in code.
Instead, it describes why a pending exception should be injected
before a pending NMI/interrupt.

Therefore, move currently present comment to code-block evaluating
a new pending event which explains why exception.pending is evaluated
first.
In addition, create a new comment describing that exception.pending
blocks re-injection of NMI/interrupt because the exception was
queued by handling vmexit which was due to NMI/interrupt delivery.
