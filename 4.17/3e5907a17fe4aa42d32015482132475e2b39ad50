drm: rcar-du: lvds: Fix LVDCR1 for R-Car gen3

The LVDCR1 register for the R-Car gen3 SoCs was documented as having the
layout different from the gen2 SoCs in  the early R-Car gen3 manuals but
since v0.52 the LVDCR1 layout is described as being the same as on the gen2
SoCs; the old CHn control values are said to be prohibited now (and there
seems to be no valid output signal when they are used).
