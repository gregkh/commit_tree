x86/cpufeatures: Enumerate cldemote instruction

cldemote is a new instruction in future x86 processors. It hints
to hardware that a specified cache line should be moved ("demoted")
from the cache(s) closest to the processor core to a level more
distant from the processor core. This instruction is faster than
snooping to make the cache line available for other cores.

cldemote instruction is indicated by the presence of the CPUID
feature flag CLDEMOTE (CPUID.(EAX=0x7, ECX=0):ECX[bit25]).

More details on cldemote instruction can be found in the latest
Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions and Future Features
Programming Reference.
