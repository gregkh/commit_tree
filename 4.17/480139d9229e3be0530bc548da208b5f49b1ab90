mtd: rawnand: get rid of the JEDEC parameter page in nand_chip

The NAND chip parameter page is statically allocated within the
nand_chip structure, which reserves a lot of space. Even not ONFI nor
JEDEC chips have it embedded. Also, only a few parameters are actually
read from the parameter page after the detection.

Now that there is a small nand_parameters structure that can held
generic parameters, remove the JEDEC page from the nand_chip structure
by just allocating it during the identification phase and removing it
right after.
