radix tree test suite: add item_delete_rcu()

Currently the lifetime of "struct item" entries in the radix tree are
not controlled by RCU, but are instead deleted inline as they are
removed from the tree.

In the following patches we add a test which has threads iterating over
items pulled from the tree and verifying them in an
rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() section.  This means that though an
item has been removed from the tree it could still be being worked on by
other threads until the RCU grace period expires.  So, we need to
actually free the "struct item" structures at the end of the grace
period, just as we do with "struct radix_tree_node" items.
