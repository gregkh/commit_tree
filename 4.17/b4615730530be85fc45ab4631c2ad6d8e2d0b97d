drm/i915/audio: Fix audio detection issue on GLK

On Geminilake, sometimes audio card is not getting
detected after reboot. This is a spurious issue happening on
Geminilake. HW codec and HD audio controller link was going
out of sync for which there was a fix in i915 driver but
was not getting invoked for GLK. Extending this fix to GLK as well.

Tested by Du,Wenkai on GLK board.

Bspec: 21829

v2: Instead of checking GEN9_BC, BXT and GLK macros, use IS_GEN9 macro (Jani N)
