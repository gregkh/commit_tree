affs_lookup: switch to d_splice_alias()

Making something exportable takes more than providing ->s_export_ops.
In particular, ->lookup() *MUST* use d_splice_alias() instead of
d_add().

Reading Documentation/filesystems/nfs/Exporting would've been a good idea;
as it is, exporting AFFS is badly (and exploitably) broken.
