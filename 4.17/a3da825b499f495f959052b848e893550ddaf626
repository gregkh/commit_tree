scsi: lpfc: Fix SCSI lun discovery when port configured for both SCSI and NVME

When a port is configured for NVME and SCSI Initiator support and it probes
a target supporting both SCSI and NVME, NVME devices are discovered, but
SCSI devices are not.

The nlp_fc4_type for all NPorts should be cleared on Link Up or just before
GID_FTs get issued, as opposed to just during GID_FT cmpl.  RSCN activity as
well as Link Up can trigger GID_FT.  One GID_FT may complete before the next
one is issued.

Fix by clearng nlp_fc4_type on link up and just before both GID_FTs are
issued.  During port swapping, copy nlp_fc4_type to the new ndlp
