fs: add do_mkdirat() helper and ksys_mkdir() wrapper; remove in-kernel calls to syscall

Using the fs-internal do_mkdirat() helper allows us to get rid of
fs-internal calls to the sys_mkdirat() syscall.

Introducing the ksys_mkdir() wrapper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls
to the sys_mkdir() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is
meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the
same calling convention as sys_mkdir().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
