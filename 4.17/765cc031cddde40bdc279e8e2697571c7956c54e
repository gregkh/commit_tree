nvme: change namespaces_mutext to namespaces_rwsem

namespaces_mutext is used to synchronize the operations on ctrl
namespaces list. Most of the time, it is a read operation.

On the other hand, there are many interfaces in nvme core that
need this lock, such as nvme_wait_freeze, and even more interfaces
will be added. If we use mutex here, circular dependency could be
introduced easily. For example:
context A                  context B
nvme_xxx                   nvme_xxx
hold namespaces_mutext     require namespaces_mutext
sync context B

So it is better to change it from mutex to rwsem.
