lib/find_bit_benchmark.c: avoid soft lockup in test_find_first_bit()

test_find_first_bit() is intentionally sub-optimal, and may cause soft
lockup due to long time of run on some systems.  So decrease length of
bitmap to traverse to avoid lockup.

With the change below, time of test execution doesn't exceed 0.2 seconds
on my testing system.
