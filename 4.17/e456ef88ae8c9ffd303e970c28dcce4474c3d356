ima: drop vla in ima_audit_measurement()

In keeping with the directive to get rid of VLAs [1], let's drop the VLA
from ima_audit_measurement(). We need to adjust the return type of
ima_audit_measurement, because now this function can fail if an allocation
fails.

v2: just use audit_log_format instead of doing a second allocation
v3: ignore failures in ima_audit_measurement()
