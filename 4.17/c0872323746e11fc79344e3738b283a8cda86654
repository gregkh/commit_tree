btrfs: print-tree: debugging output enhancement

This patch enhances the following things:

- tree block header
  * add generation and owner output for node and leaf
- node pointer generation output
- allow btrfs_print_tree() to not follow nodes
  * just like btrfs-progs

Please note that, although function btrfs_print_tree() is not called by
anyone right now, it's still a pretty useful function to debug kernel.
So that function is still kept for later use.
