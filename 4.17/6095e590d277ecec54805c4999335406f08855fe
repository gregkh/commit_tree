ibmvnic: Disable irqs before exiting reset from closed state

When the driver is closed, all the associated irqs are disabled. In the
event that the driver exits a reset in the closed state, we should be
consistent with the state we are in directly after a close. So before we
exit the reset routine, all irqs should be disabled as well. This will
prevent the irqs from being enabled twice in this case and reporting a
number of noisy warning traces.
