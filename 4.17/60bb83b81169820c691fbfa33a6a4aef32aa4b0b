resource: fix integer overflow at reallocation

We've got a bug report indicating a kernel panic at booting on an x86-32
system, and it turned out to be the invalid PCI resource assigned after
reallocation.  __find_resource() first aligns the resource start address
and resets the end address with start+size-1 accordingly, then checks
whether it's contained.  Here the end address may overflow the integer,
although resource_contains() still returns true because the function
validates only start and end address.  So this ends up with returning an
invalid resource (start > end).

There was already an attempt to cover such a problem in the commit
47ea91b4052d ("Resource: fix wrong resource window calculation"), but
this case is an overseen one.

This patch adds the validity check of the newly calculated resource for
avoiding the integer overflow problem.
