tracing: Rewrite filter logic to be simpler and faster

Al Viro reviewed the filter logic of ftrace trace events and found it to be
very troubling. It creates a binary tree based on the logic operators and
walks it during tracing. He sent myself and Tom Zanussi a long explanation
(and formal proof) of how to do the string parsing better and end up with a
program array that can be simply iterated to come up with the correct
results.

I took his ideas and his pseudo code and rewrote the filter logic based on
them. In doing so, I was able to remove a lot of code, and have a much more
condensed filter logic in the process. I wrote a very long comment
describing the methadology that Al proposed in my own words. For more info
on how this works, read the comment above predicate_parse().
