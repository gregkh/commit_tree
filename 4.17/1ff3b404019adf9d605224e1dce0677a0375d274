powerpc/xmon: Clear all breakpoints when xmon is disabled via debugfs

Presently when xmon is disabled by debugfs any existing
instruction/data-access breakpoints set are not disabled. This may
lead to kernel oops when those breakpoints are hit as the necessary
debugger hooks aren't installed.

Hence this patch introduces a new function named clear_all_bpt() which
is called when xmon is disabled via debugfs. The function will
unpatch/clear all the trap and ciabr/dab based breakpoints.
