net: Convert inet6_net_ops

init method initializes sysctl defaults, allocates
percpu arrays and creates /proc entries.
exit method reverts the above.

There are no pernet_operations, which are interested
in the above entities of foreign net namespace, so
inet6_net_ops are able to be marked as async.
