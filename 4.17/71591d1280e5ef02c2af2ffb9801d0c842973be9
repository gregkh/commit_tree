RDMA/hns: Replace __raw_write*(cpu_to_le*()) with LE write*()

There is no need to repeat the semantics of writel() and similar.
Moreover sparse complains about this:

drivers/infiniband/hw/hns/hns_roce_hw_v1.c:1690:22: expected unsigned long long val
drivers/infiniband/hw/hns/hns_roce_hw_v1.c:1690:22: got restricted __le64 <noident>

Fixing this by replacing __raw_write*(cpu_to_le*()) calls by plain
write*() ones.

Note, write*() accessors are little endian by definition.
