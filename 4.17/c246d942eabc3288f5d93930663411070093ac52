net/smc: restructure netinfo for CLC proposal msgs

Introduce functions smc_clc_prfx_set to retrieve IP information for the
CLC proposal msg and smc_clc_prfx_match to match the contents of a
proposal message against the IP addresses of the net device. The new
functions replace the functionality provided by smc_clc_netinfo_by_tcpsk,
which is removed by this patch. The match functionality is extended to
scan all ipv4 addresses of the net device for a match against the
ipv4 subnet from the proposal msg.
