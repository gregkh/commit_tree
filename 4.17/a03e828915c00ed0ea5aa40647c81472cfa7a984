thunderbolt: Serialize PCIe tunnel creation with PCI rescan

We need to make sure a new PCIe tunnel is not created in a middle of
previous PCI rescan because otherwise the rescan code might find too
much and fail to reconfigure devices properly. This is important when
native PCIe hotplug is used. In BIOS assisted hotplug there should be no
such issue.
