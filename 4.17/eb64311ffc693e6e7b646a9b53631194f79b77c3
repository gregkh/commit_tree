media: platform: sh_veu: use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Cast left and top to dma_addr_t in order to give the compiler complete
information about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice that these
variables are being used in contexts that expect expressions of
type dma_addr_t (64 bit, unsigned).

Such expressions are currently being evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic.

Also, move the expression (((dma_addr_t)left * veu->vfmt_out.fmt->depth) >> 3)
at the end in order to avoid a line wrapping checkpatch.pl warning.
