mlxsw: spectrum: Distinguish between IPv4/6 tunnels

struct ip_tunnel_parm, where GRE and several other tunnel types hold
information, is IPv4-specific. The current router / ipip code in mlxsw
however uses it as if it were generic.

Make it clear that it's not. Rename many functions from _params_ to
_params4_. mlxsw_sp_ipip_parms_saddr() and _daddr() take a proto
argument to dispatch on it. Move the dispatch logic to
mlxsw_sp_ipip_netdev_saddr() and _daddr(), and replace with
single-protocol functions.

In struct mlxsw_sp_ipip_entry, move the "parms" field to a (for the time
being, singleton) union. Update users throughout.
