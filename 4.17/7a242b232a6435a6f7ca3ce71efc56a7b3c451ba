net: hns3: fix for coal configuation lost when setting the channel

This patch fixes the coalesce configuation lost problem when
setting the channel number by restoring all vectors's coalesce
configuation to vector 0's, because all vectors belonging to
the same netdev have the same coalesce configuation for now.
