drm/i915/selftests: Use a sacrificial context for hang testing

Avoid injecting hangs in to the i915->kernel_context in case the GPU
reset leaves corruption in the context image in its wake (leading to
continual failures and system hangs after the selftests are ostensibly
complete). Use a sacrificial kernel_context instead.

v2: Closing a context is tricky; export a function (for selftests) from
i915_gem_context.c to get it right.
