btrfs: delayed-inode: Remove wrong qgroup meta reservation calls

Commit 4f5427ccce5d ("btrfs: delayed-inode: Use new qgroup meta rsv for
delayed inode and item") merged into mainline was not latest version
submitted to the mail list in Dec 2017.

Which lacks the following fixes:

1) Remove btrfs_qgroup_convert_reserved_meta() call in
   btrfs_delayed_item_release_metadata()
2) Remove btrfs_qgroup_reserve_meta_prealloc() call in
   btrfs_delayed_inode_reserve_metadata()

Those fixes will resolve unexpected EDQUOT problems.
