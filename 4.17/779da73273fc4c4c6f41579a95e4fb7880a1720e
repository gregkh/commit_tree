iommu/amd: Turn dev_data_list into a lock less list

alloc_dev_data() adds new items to dev_data_list and search_dev_data()
is searching for items in this list. Both protect the access to the list
with a spinlock.
There is no need to navigate forth and back within the list and there is
also no deleting of a specific item. This qualifies the list to become a
lock less list and as part of this, the spinlock can be removed.
With this change the ordering of those items within the list is changed:
before the change new items were added to the end of the list, now they
are added to the front. I don't think it matters but wanted to mention
it.
