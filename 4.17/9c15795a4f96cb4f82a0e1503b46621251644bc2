ARM: dts: meson8b-odroidc1: ethernet support

The Odroid-C1+ board is equipped with an RTL8211F ethernet PHY
which supports 10/100/1000 Mbps ethernet.
The PHY reset and interrupt lines are controlled by the SoC via
two GPIO lines (GPIOH_4 and GPIOH_3 respectively).
The PHY energy efficient ethernet (eee) mode is marked as broken
using "eee-broken-1000t" because, during tests, high packet losses
were experienced without it.
