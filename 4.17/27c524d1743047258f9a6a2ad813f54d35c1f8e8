MIPS: Use the entry point from the ELF file header

In order to fetch the correct entry point with the ISA bit included, for
use by non-ELF boot loaders, parse the output of `objdump -f' for the
start address recorded in the kernel executable itself, rather than
using `nm' to get the value of the `kernel_entry' symbol.

Sign-extend the address retrieved if 32-bit, so that execution is
correctly started on 64-bit processors as well.  The tool always prints
the entry point using either 8 or 16 hexadecimal digits, matching the
address width (aka class) of the ELF file, even in the presence of
leading zeros.
