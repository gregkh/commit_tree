ASoC: soc-io: Fix snd_soc_component_update_bits_legacy

After the codec to component conversion codecs with custom read/write
function will no longer able to use update_bits as their io callbacks are
registered at component->driver level and not in component level.

To not complicate the code further, lets just use the
snd_soc_component_read/snd_soc_component_write function and let them sort
out the correct io function to call.
