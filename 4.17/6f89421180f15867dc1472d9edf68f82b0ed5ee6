net: bcmgenet: Fix sparse warnings in bcmgenet_put_tx_csum()

skb->protocol is a __be16 which we would be calling htons() against,
while this is not wrong per-se as it correctly results in swapping the
value on LE hosts, this still upsets sparse. Adopt a similar pattern to
what other drivers do and just assign ip_ver to skb->protocol, and then
use htons() against the different constants such that the compiler can
resolve the values at build time.
