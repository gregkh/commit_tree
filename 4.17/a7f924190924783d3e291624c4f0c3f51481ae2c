kbuild: add %.dtb.S and %.dtb to 'targets' automatically

Another common pattern that consists of chained commands is to compile
a DTB as binary data into the kernel image or a module.  It is used in
several places in the source tree.  Support it in the core Makefile.

$(call if_changed,dt_S_dtb) is more suitable than $(call cmd,dt_S_dtb)
in case cmd_dt_S_dtb is changed in the future.
