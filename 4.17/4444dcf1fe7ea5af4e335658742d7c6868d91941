serial: imx: use u32 variables with matching names for registers

The serial/imx driver is full of inconsistently named and typed
variables that hold different register values.

Consistently use u32 as type (matching what readl and writel use) and
name the variables after the register whose value they are holding.
This makes it easier to notice when UCR2_RTSEN is written to UCR1.

The only difference introduced by this commit in the compiled driver is
that twice the second argument to warn_slowpath_null() changed because the
two WARN_ON in dma_rx_callback() pass __LINE__ to warn_slowpath_null().
