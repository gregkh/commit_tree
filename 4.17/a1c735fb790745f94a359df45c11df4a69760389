blk-mq: make sure that correct hctx->next_cpu is set

From commit 20e4d81393196 (blk-mq: simplify queue mapping & schedule
with each possisble CPU), one hctx can be mapped from all offline CPUs,
then hctx->next_cpu can be set as wrong.

This patch fixes this issue by making hctx->next_cpu pointing to the
first CPU in hctx->cpumask if all CPUs in hctx->cpumask are offline.
