sctp: add refcnt support for sh_key

With refcnt support for sh_key, chunks auth sh_keys can be decided
before enqueuing it. Changing the active key later will not affect
the chunks already enqueued.

Furthermore, this is necessary when adding the support for authinfo
for sendmsg in next patch.

Note that struct sctp_chunk can't be grown due to that performance
drop issue on slow cpu, so it just reuses head_skb memory for shkey
in sctp_chunk.
