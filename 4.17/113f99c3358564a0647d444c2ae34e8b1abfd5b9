net: test tailroom before appending to linear skb

Device features may change during transmission. In particular with
corking, a device may toggle scatter-gather in between allocating
and writing to an skb.

Do not unconditionally assume that !NETIF_F_SG at write time implies
that the same held at alloc time and thus the skb has sufficient
tailroom.

This issue predates git history.
