ARM: OMAP2+: powerdomain: use raw_smp_processor_id() for trace

smp_processor_id() checks preemption if CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is enabled,
causing a warning dump during boot:

[    5.042377] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: swapper/0/1
[    5.050281] caller is pwrdm_set_next_pwrst+0x48/0x88
[    5.055330] CPU: 1 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.14.24-g57341df0b4 #1

Use the raw_smp_processor_id() for the trace instead, this value does
not need to be perfectly correct. The alternative of disabling preempt
is too heavy weight operation to be applied in PM hot path for just
tracing purposes.
