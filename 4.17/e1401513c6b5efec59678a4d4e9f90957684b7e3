mm/hmm: HMM should have a callback before MM is destroyed

hmm_mirror_register() registers a callback for when the CPU pagetable is
modified.  Normally, the device driver will call hmm_mirror_unregister()
when the process using the device is finished.  However, if the process
exits uncleanly, the struct_mm can be destroyed with no warning to the
device driver.
