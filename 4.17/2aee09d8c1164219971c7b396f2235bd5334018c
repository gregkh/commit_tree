mm/hmm: change hmm_vma_fault() to allow write fault on page basis

This changes hmm_vma_fault() to not take a global write fault flag for a
range but instead rely on caller to populate HMM pfns array with proper
fault flag ie HMM_PFN_VALID if driver want read fault for that address or
HMM_PFN_VALID and HMM_PFN_WRITE for write.

Moreover by setting HMM_PFN_DEVICE_PRIVATE the device driver can ask for
device private memory to be migrated back to system memory through page
fault.

This is more flexible API and it better reflects how device handles and
reports fault.
