proc: move "struct proc_dir_entry" into kmem cache

"struct proc_dir_entry" is variable sized because of 0-length trailing
array for name, however, because of SLAB padding allocations it is
possible to make "struct proc_dir_entry" fixed sized and allocate same
amount of memory.

It buys fine-grained debugging with poisoning and usercopy protection
which is not possible with kmalloc-* caches.

Currently, on 32-bit 91+ byte allocations go into kmalloc-128 and on
64-bit 147+ byte allocations go to kmalloc-192 anyway.

Additional memory is allocated only for 38/46+ byte long names which are
rare or may not even exist in the wild.
