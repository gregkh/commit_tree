scsi: qedf: remove redundant initialization of 'fcport'

Pointer fcport is initialized with a value that is never read, it is
re-assigned a new value later on, hence the initialization is redundant
and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/scsi/qedf/qedf_io.c:920:21: warning: Value stored to 'fcport'
during its initialization is never read
