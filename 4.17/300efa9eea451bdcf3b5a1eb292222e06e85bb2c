    drm/i915/gen9+: Set same power state before hibernation image
    save/restore

during hibernation/suspend the power domain functionality got disabled,
after which resume could leave it incorrectly disabled if the ACPI
target state was S0 during suspend and i915 was not loaded by the loader
kernel.

This was caused by not considering if we resumed from hibernation as the
condition for power domains reiniting.

Fix this by simply tracking if we suspended power domains during system
suspend and reinit power domains accordingly during resume. This will
result in reiniting power domains always when resuming from hibernation,
regardless of the platform and whether or not i915 is loaded by the
loader kernel.

The reason we didn't catch this earlier is that the enabled/disabled
state of power domains during PMSG_FREEZE/PMSG_QUIESCE is platform
and kernel config dependent: on my SKL the target state is S4
during PMSG_FREEZE and (with the driver loaded in the loader kernel)
S0 during PMSG_QUIESCE. On the reporter's machine it's S0 during
PMSG_FREEZE but (contrary to this) power domains are not initialized
during PMSG_QUIESCE since i915 is not loaded in the loader kernel, or
it's loaded but without the DMC firmware being available.
