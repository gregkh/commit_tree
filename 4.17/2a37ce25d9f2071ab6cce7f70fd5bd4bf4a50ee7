nvmem: disallow modular CONFIG_NVMEM

The new of_get_nvmem_mac_address() helper function causes a link error
with CONFIG_NVMEM=m:

drivers/of/of_net.o: In function `of_get_nvmem_mac_address':
of_net.c:(.text+0x168): undefined reference to `of_nvmem_cell_get'
of_net.c:(.text+0x19c): undefined reference to `nvmem_cell_read'
of_net.c:(.text+0x1a8): undefined reference to `nvmem_cell_put'

I could not come up with a good solution for this, as the code is always
built-in. Using an #if IS_REACHABLE() check around it would solve the
link time issue but then stop it from working in that configuration.
Making of_nvmem_cell_get() an inline function could also solve that, but
seems a bit ugly since it's somewhat larger than most inline functions,
and it would just bring that problem into the callers.  Splitting the
function into a separate file might be an alternative.

This uses the big hammer by making CONFIG_NVMEM itself a 'bool' symbol,
which avoids the problem entirely but makes the vmlinux larger for anyone
that might use NVMEM support but doesn't need it built-in otherwise.
