SUNRPC: Make RTT measurement more precise (Receive)

Some RPC transports have more overhead in their reply handlers
than others. For example, for RPC-over-RDMA:

- RPC completion has to wait for memory invalidation, which is
  not a part of the server/network round trip

- Recently a context switch was introduced into the reply handler,
  which further artificially inflates the measure of RPC RTT

To capture just server and network latencies more precisely: when
receiving a reply, compute the RTT as soon as the XID is recognized
rather than at RPC completion time.
