proc: get rid of task lock/unlock pair to read umask for the "status" file

get_task_umask locks/unlocks the task on its own.  The only caller does
the same thing immediately after.

Utilize the fact the task has to be locked anyway and just do it once.
Since there are no other users and the code is short, fold it in.
