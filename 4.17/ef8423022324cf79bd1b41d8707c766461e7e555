device-dax: allow MAP_SYNC to succeed

MAP_SYNC is a nop for device-dax. Allow MAP_SYNC to succeed on device-dax
to eliminate special casing between device-dax and fs-dax as to when the
flag can be specified. Device-dax users already implicitly assume that they do
not need to call fsync(), and this enables them to explicitly check for this
capability.
