perf trace: Support MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE

Introduced in a4ff8e8620d3 ("mm: introduce MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE"), and
now that we have that define in the just syncronized
tools/arch/*/include/uapi/asm/mman.h files, add support for it.

This should really transition to autogeneration of string tables as
done for various other things:

  $ ls /tmp/build/perf/trace/beauty/generated/*.c
  arch_errno_name_array.c kcmp_type_array.c madvise_behavior_array.c
  pkey_alloc_access_rights_array.c prctl_option_array.c
  $ head /tmp/build/perf/trace/beauty/generated/madvise_behavior_array.c
  static const char *madvise_advices[] = {
	[0] = "NORMAL",
	[1] = "RANDOM",
	[2] = "SEQUENTIAL",
	[3] = "WILLNEED",
	[4] = "DONTNEED",
	[8] = "FREE",
	[9] = "REMOVE",
	[10] = "DONTFORK",
	[11] = "DOFORK",
  $

Till then, add support for this the old way.

Also it has to be ifdef'ed, because arches like mips still don't define
it. The proper solution will be to have per-arch tables for these
values to support cross-analysis.
