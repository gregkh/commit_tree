misc: rtsx: make various functions static

The functions rts5260_get_ocpstat, rts5260_get_ocpstat2,
rts5260_clear_ocpstat, rts5260_process_ocp, rts5260_init_hw and
rts5260_set_aspm are local to the source and do not need to be
in global scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'rts5260_get_ocpstat' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'rts5260_get_ocpstat2' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'rts5260_clear_ocpstat' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'rts5260_process_ocp' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'rts5260_init_hw' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'rts5260_set_aspm' was not declared. Should it be static?
