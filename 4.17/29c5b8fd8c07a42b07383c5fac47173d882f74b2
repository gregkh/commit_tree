ASoC: Intel: Skylake: make function skl_clk_round_rate static

The function skl_clk_round_rate is local to the source and does not
need to be in global scope, so make it static.

Cleans up sparse warning:
sound/soc/intel/skylake/skl-ssp-clk.c:250:6: warning: symbol
'skl_clk_round_rate' was not declared. Should it be static?
