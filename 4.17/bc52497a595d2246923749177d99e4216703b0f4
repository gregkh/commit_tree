MAINTAINERS: update entry for ARM/berlin

Synaptics has acquired the Multimedia Solutions Business of Marvell[1].
So change the berlin entry name and move it to its alphabetical
location. We move to ARM/Synaptics instead of ARM/Marvell.

This patch also updates my email address from marvell to synaptics.
