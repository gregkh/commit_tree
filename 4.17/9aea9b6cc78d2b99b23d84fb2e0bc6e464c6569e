usb: musb: trace: fix NULL pointer dereference in musb_g_tx()

The usb_request pointer could be NULL in musb_g_tx(), where the
tracepoint call would trigger the NULL pointer dereference failure when
parsing the members of the usb_request pointer.

Move the tracepoint call to where the usb_request pointer is already
checked to solve the issue.
