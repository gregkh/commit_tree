nvme: Add .stop_ctrl to nvme ctrl ops

For consistancy reasons, any fabric-specific works
(e.g error recovery/reconnect) should be canceled in
nvme_stop_ctrl, as for all other NVMe pending works
(e.g. scan, keep alive).

The patch aims to simplify the logic of the code, as
we now only rely on a vague demand from any fabric
to flush its private workqueues at the beginning of
.delete_ctrl op.
