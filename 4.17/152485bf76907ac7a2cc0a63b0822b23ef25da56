s390/qdio: simplify math in get_*_buffer_frontier()

When determining the buffer count that get_buf_states() should
be queried for, 'count' is capped at 127 buffers.
So the check
	q->first_to_check == (q->first_to_check + count) % 128
can be reduced to
	count == 0

This helps to emphasize that get_buf_states() is really only
called with count > 0.
