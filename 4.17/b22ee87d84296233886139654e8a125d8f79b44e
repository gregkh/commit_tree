scsi: pmcraid: remove redundant initializations of pointer 'ioadl'

There are several occurrances where pointer ioadl is initialized with a
value that is never read and where it is re-assigned a new value later
on, hence the initialization is redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:1028:29: warning: Value stored to 'ioadl' during
its initialization is never read
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:3178:29: warning: Value stored to 'ioadl' during
its initialization is never read
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:5495:29: warning: Value stored to 'ioadl' during
its initialization is never read
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:5668:29: warning: Value stored to 'ioadl' during
its initialization is never read
