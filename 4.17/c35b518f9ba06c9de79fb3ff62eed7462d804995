clk: tegra: Fix pll_u rate configuration

Turns out latest upstream U-Boot does not configure/enable pll_u which
leaves it at some default rate of 500 kHz:

root@apalis-t30:~# cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary | grep pll_u
       pll_u                  3        3        0      500000          0

Of course this won't quite work leading to the following messages:

[    6.559593] usb 2-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using tegra-
ehci

Fix this by actually allowing the rate also being set from within
the Linux kernel.
