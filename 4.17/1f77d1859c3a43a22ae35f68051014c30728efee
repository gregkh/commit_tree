eeprom: at24: rename at24_get_pdata()

As preparation for at24_probe() refactoring: rename at24_get_pdata()
to at24_properties_to_pdata(). We're doing it because we'll move the
pdata parsing code into a separate function which will be called
at24_get_pdata(). Current routine with that name actually parses
the device properties so change its name to reflect its purpose.
