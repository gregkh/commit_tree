ARM: OMAP2+: Prepare to pass auxdata for smartreflex

We are still initializing smartreflex with platform data using
omap_device_build(). We can instead pass the platform data in
with auxdata in pdata-quirks.c and make the driver use that
in later patches.

Note that we cannot enable the auxdata use yet, this is done
in the last patch of the series.
