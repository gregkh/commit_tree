net: Convert icmpv6_sk_ops, ndisc_net_ops and igmp6_net_ops

These pernet_operations create and destroy net::ipv6.icmp_sk
socket, used to send ICMP or error reply.

Nobody can dereference the socket to handle a packet before
net is initialized, as there is no routing; nobody can do
that in parallel with exit, as all of devices are moved
to init_net or destroyed and there are no packets it-flight.
So, it's possible to mark these pernet_operations as async.

The same for ndisc_net_ops and for igmp6_net_ops. The last
one also creates and destroys /proc entries.
