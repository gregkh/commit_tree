net/mlx5: IPSec, Add support for ESN

Currently ESN is not supported with IPSec device offload.

This patch adds ESN support to IPsec device offload.
Implementing new xfrm device operation to synchronize offloading device
ESN with xfrm received SN. New QP command to update SA state at the
following:

           ESN 1                    ESN 2                  ESN 3
|-----------*-----------|-----------*-----------|-----------*
^           ^           ^           ^           ^           ^

^ - marks where QP command invoked to update the SA ESN state
    machine.
| - marks the start of the ESN scope (0-2^32-1). At this point move SA
    ESN overlap bit to zero and increment ESN.
* - marks the middle of the ESN scope (2^31). At this point move SA
    ESN overlap bit to one.
