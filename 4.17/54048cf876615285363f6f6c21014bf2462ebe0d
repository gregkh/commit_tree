powerpc/eeh: Factor out common code eeh_reset_device()

The caller will always pass NULL for 'rmv_data' when
'eeh_aware_driver' is true, so the first two calls to
eeh_pe_dev_traverse() can be combined without changing behaviour as
can the two arms of the final 'if' block.

This should not change behaviour.
