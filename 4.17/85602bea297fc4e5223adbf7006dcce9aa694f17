RISC-V: build vdso-dummy.o with -no-pie

Debian toolcahin defaults to PIE, and I guess that will also be the case
of most distributions. This causes the following build failure:

  AS      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/getcpu.o
  AS      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/flush_icache.o
  VDSOLD  arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso.so.dbg
  OBJCOPY arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso.so
  AS      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso.o
  VDSOLD  arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-dummy.o
  LD      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.o
riscv64-linux-gnu-ld: attempted static link of dynamic object `arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-dummy.o'
make[2]: *** [arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/Makefile:43: arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vdso-syms.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [scripts/Makefile.build:575: arch/riscv/kernel/vdso] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:1018: arch/riscv/kernel] Error 2

While the root Makefile correctly passes "-fno-PIE" to build individual
object files, the RISC-V kernel also builds vdso-dummy.o as an
executable, which is therefore linked as PIE. Fix that by updating this
specific link rule to also include "-no-pie".
