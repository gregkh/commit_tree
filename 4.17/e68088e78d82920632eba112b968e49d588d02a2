IB/srp: Fix srp_abort()

Before commit e494f6a72839 ("[SCSI] improved eh timeout handler") it
did not really matter whether or not abort handlers like srp_abort()
called .scsi_done() when returning another value than SUCCESS. Since
that commit however this matters. Hence only call .scsi_done() when
returning SUCCESS.
