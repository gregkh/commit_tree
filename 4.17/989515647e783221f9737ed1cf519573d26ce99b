rtc: Add one offset seconds to expand RTC range

From our investigation for all RTC drivers, 1 driver will be expired before
year 2017, 7 drivers will be expired before year 2038, 23 drivers will be
expired before year 2069, 72 drivers will be expired before 2100 and 104
drivers will be expired before 2106. Especially for these early expired
drivers, we need to expand the RTC range to make the RTC can still work
after the expired year.

So we can expand the RTC range by adding one offset to the time when reading
from hardware, and subtracting it when writing back. For example, if you have
an RTC that can do 100 years, and currently is configured to be based in
Jan 1 1970, so it can represents times from 1970 to 2069. Then if you change
the start year from 1970 to 2000, which means it can represents times from
2000 to 2099. By adding or subtracting the offset produced by moving the wrap
point, all times between 1970 and 1999 from RTC hardware could get interpreted
as times from 2070 to 2099, but the interpretation of dates between 2000 and
2069 would not change.
