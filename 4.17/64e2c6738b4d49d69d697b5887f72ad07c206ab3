io: define several IO & PIO barrier types for the asm-generic version

Getting ready to harden readX()/writeX() and inX()/outX() semantics for the
generic implementation.

Defining two set of macros as __io_br() and __io_ar() to indicate actions
to be taken before and after MMIO read.

Defining two set of macros as __io_bw() and __io_aw() to indicate actions
to be taken before and after MMIO write.

Defining two set of macros as __io_pbw() and __io_paw() to indicate actions
to be taken before and after Port IO write.

Defining two set of macros as __io_pbr() and __io_par() to indicate actions
to be taken before and after Port IO read.

If rmb() is available for the architecture, prefer rmb() as the default
implementation of __io_ar()/__io_par().

If wmb() is available for the architecture, prefer wmb() as the default
implementation of __io_bw()/__io_pbw().
