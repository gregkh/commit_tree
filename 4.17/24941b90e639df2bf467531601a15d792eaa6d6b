null_blk: add 'requeue' fault attribute

Similarly to the support we have for testing/faking timeouts for
null_blk, this adds support for triggering a requeue condition.
Considering the issues around restart we've been seeing, this should be
a useful addition to the testing arsenal to ensure that we are handling
requeue conditions correctly.

This works for queue mode 1 (legacy request_fn based path) and 2 (blk-mq
path), as there's no good way to do requeue with a bio based driver.
This is similar to the timeout path. For the blk-mq path, we alternate
between passing back BLK_STS_RESOURCE and manually calling
blk_mq_requeue_request() in the driver. The former will hit the core
requeue path, while the latter exercises the IO scheduler requeue
path.
