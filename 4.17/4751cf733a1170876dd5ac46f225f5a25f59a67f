drm/simple_kms_helper: Fix NULL pointer dereference with no active CRTC

It is possible that drm_simple_kms_plane_atomic_check called
with no CRTC set, e.g. when user-space application sets CRTC_ID/FB_ID
to 0 before doing any actual drawing. This leads to NULL pointer
dereference because in this case new CRTC state is NULL and must be
checked before accessing.
