mmc: dw_mmc: Remove prev_state and state assignment for STATE_SENDING_CMD

Clang reports a compile warning:
drivers/mmc/host/dw_mmc.c:2124:5: warning: Value stored to 'prev_state'
is never read

By checking the code, prev_state and state assignment for
STATE_SENDING_CMD is indeed never used after jumping to unlock tag.
So remove it.
