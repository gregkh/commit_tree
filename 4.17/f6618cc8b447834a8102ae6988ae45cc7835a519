media: lgdt3306a: remove symbol count mismatch fix

This symbol mismatch is handled by NULL'ing out the release
callback if the driver is loaded as an i2c device.

This patch reverts:
- commit 94448e21cf08 ("media: lgdt3306a: Fix a double kfree on i2c
  device remove")
- commit 835d66173a38 ("media: lgdt3306a: Fix module count mismatch
  on usb unplug")

The symbol count mismatch is handled by:
- commit 5b3a8e906973 ("media: lgdt3306a: Set fe ops.release to
  NULL if probed")
