Revert "drm: Use a flexible array member for blob property data"

Using a flexible array for the blob data was a mistake by me. It
forces all users of the blob data to cast blob->data to something
else. void* is clearly superior so let's go back to the original
scheme.

Not a clean revert as the code has moved.

This reverts commit d63f5e6bf6f2a1573ea39c9937cdf5ab0b3a4b77.
