afs: Fix VNOVOL handling in address rotation

If a volume location record lists multiple file servers for a volume, then
it's possible that due to a misconfiguration or a changing configuration
that one of the file servers doesn't know about it yet and will abort
VNOVOL.  Currently, the rotation algorithm will stop with EREMOTEIO.

Fix this by moving on to try the next server if VNOVOL is returned.  Once
all the servers have been tried and the record rechecked, the algorithm
will stop with EREMOTEIO or ENOMEDIUM.
