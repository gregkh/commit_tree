mtd: update documentation of mtd_device_parse_register()

In the commit 2c77c57d22adb ("mtd: move code adding master MTD out of
mtd_add_device_partitions()") behavior of mtd_device_parse_register()
has very slightly changed. It's a pretty non-significant order change
to match updated function behavior.
