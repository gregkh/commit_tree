ARM: dts: uniphier: use proper SPDX-License-Identifier style

According to Documentation/process/license-rules.rst, move the SPDX
License Identifier to the very top of the file.  I used C++ comment
style not only for the SPDX line but for the entire block because
this seems Linus' preference [1].  I also dropped the parentheses to
follow the examples in that document.
