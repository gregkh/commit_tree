pwm: mediatek: Improve precision in rate calculation

Add a way that turning resolution from in nanosecond into in picosecond
to improve noticeably almost 4.5% precision.

It's necessary to hold the new resolution with type u64 and thus related
operations on u64 are applied instead in those rate calculations.

And the patch has a dependency on [1].
