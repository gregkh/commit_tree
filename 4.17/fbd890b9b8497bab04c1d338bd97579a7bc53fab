arm64: capabilities: Allow features based on local CPU scope

So far we have treated the feature capabilities as system wide
and this wouldn't help with features that could be detected locally
on one or more CPUs (e.g, KPTI, Software prefetch). This patch
splits the feature detection to two phases :

 1) Local CPU features are checked on all boot time active CPUs.
 2) System wide features are checked only once after all CPUs are
    active.
