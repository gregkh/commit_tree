audit: return on memory error to avoid null pointer dereference

If there is a memory allocation error when trying to change an audit
kernel feature value, the ignored allocation error will trigger a NULL
pointer dereference oops on subsequent use of that pointer.  Return
instead.

Passes audit-testsuite.
