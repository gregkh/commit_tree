clk: cs2000: set pm_ops in hibernate-compatible way

Use SET_LATE_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS() macro instead of direct assignment to
.resume_early field.

This fixes initialization of CS2000 in restore from hibernation in case
of kernel used to load image did not initialize CS2000 while kernel
being restored had CS2000 initialized.
