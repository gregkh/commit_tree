vfio/type1: Improve memory pinning process for raw PFN mapping

When using vfio to pass through a PCIe device (e.g. a GPU card) that
has a huge BAR (e.g. 16GB), a lot of cycles are wasted on memory
pinning because PFNs of PCI BAR are not backed by struct page, and
the corresponding VMA has flag VM_PFNMAP.

With this change, when pinning a region which is a raw PFN mapping,
it can skip unnecessary user memory pinning process, and thus, can
significantly improve VM's boot up time when passing through devices
via VFIO. In my test on a Xeon E5 2.6GHz, the time mapping a 16GB
BAR was reduced from about 0.4s to 1.5us.
