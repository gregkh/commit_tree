watchdog: hpwdt: remove allow_kdump module parameter.

The intent of this parameter is unclear and it sets up a
race between the reset of the system by ASR and crashdump.

The length of time between receipt of the pretimeout NMI
and the ASR reset of the system is fixed by hardware.

Turning the parameter off doesn't necessairly prevent a crash dump.
Also, having the ASR reset occur while the system is crash dumping
doesn't imply that the dump was hung given the short duration
between the NMI and the reset.

This parameter is not a substitute for having a architected watchdog
crashdump hang detection paridigm.
