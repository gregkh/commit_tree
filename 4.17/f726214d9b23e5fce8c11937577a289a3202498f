l2tp: hold reference on tunnels printed in l2tp/tunnels debugfs file

Use l2tp_tunnel_get_nth() instead of l2tp_tunnel_find_nth(), to be safe
against concurrent tunnel deletion.

Use the same mechanism as in l2tp_ppp.c for dropping the reference
taken by l2tp_tunnel_get_nth(). That is, drop the reference just
before looking up the next tunnel. In case of error, drop the last
accessed tunnel in l2tp_dfs_seq_stop().

That was the last use of l2tp_tunnel_find_nth().
