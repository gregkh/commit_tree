x86/kvm/vmx: read MSR_{FS,KERNEL_GS}_BASE from current->thread

vmx_save_host_state() is only called from kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run() so
the context is pretty well defined. Read MSR_{FS,KERNEL_GS}_BASE from
current->thread after calling save_fsgs() which takes care of
X86_BUG_NULL_SEG case now and will do RD[FG,GS]BASE when FSGSBASE
extensions are exposed to userspace (currently they are not).
