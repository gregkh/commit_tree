net : sched: cls_api: deal with egdev path only if needed

When dealing with ingress rule on a netdev, if we did fine through the
conventional path, there's no need to continue into the egdev route,
and we can stop right there.

Not doing so may cause a 2nd rule to be added by the cls api layer
with the ingress being the egdev.

For example, under sriov switchdev scheme, a user rule of VFR A --> VFR B
will end up with two HW rules (1) VF A --> VF B and (2) uplink --> VF B
