drm/i915: Add more control to wait_for routines

This patch adds a little more control to a couple wait_for routines such
that we can avoid open-coding read/wait/timeout patterns which:
 - need the value of the register after the wait_for
 - run arbitrary operation for the read portion

This patch also chooses the correct sleep function (based on
timers-howto.txt) for the polling interval the caller specifies.

Changes in v2:
- Added to the series
Changes in v3:
- Rebased on drm-intel-next-queued and the new Wmin/max _wait_for
- Removed msleep option
Changes in v4:
- Removed ; for OP in _wait_for (Chris)
- Moved reg_value definition above ret (Chris)
Changes in v4:
- checkpatch whitespace fix
Changes in v5:
- None
Changes in v6:
- None
