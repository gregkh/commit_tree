blk-mq: start request gstate with gen 1

rq->gstate and rq->aborted_gstate both are zero before rqs are
allocated. If we have a small timeout, when the timer fires,
there could be rqs that are never allocated, and also there could
be rq that has been allocated but not initialized and started. At
the moment, the rq->gstate and rq->aborted_gstate both are 0, thus
the blk_mq_terminate_expired will identify the rq is timed out and
invoke .timeout early.

For scsi, this will cause scsi_times_out to be invoked before the
scsi_cmnd is not initialized, scsi_cmnd->device is still NULL at
the moment, then we will get crash.
