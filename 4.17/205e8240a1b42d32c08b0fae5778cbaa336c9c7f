scsi: lpfc: Code cleanup for 128byte wqe data type

The driver is very sloppy about the WQE structure passed between routines.
The base struct type is a 64byte wqe. But in many routines they typecast and
access 128byte wqes. There were a couple of cases in the past (corrected
already) where the typecasts were incorrectly done and the 64byte buffer was
accessed as a 128 byte buffer.

Clean this up by properly declaring wqe's as 128byte wqe's and removing the
typecasts. 64byte wqes are considered a subset of the 128byte wqes.
