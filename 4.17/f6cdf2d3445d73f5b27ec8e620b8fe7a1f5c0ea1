ASoC: cpcap: new codec

Motorola CPCAP is a PMIC with audio functionality, that can be
found on Motorola Droid 4 and probably a few other phones from
Motorola's Droid series.

The driver has been written from scratch using Motorola's Android
driver, register dumps from running Android and datasheet for NXP
MC13783UG (which is similar to Motorola CPCAP, but not the same).

The chip provides two audio interfaces, that can be muxed to two
different audio codecs. One provides support for stereo output
(named StDAC or HiFi), while the other only provides mono output
(named Voice). Only the Voice codec provides a Capture interface.
