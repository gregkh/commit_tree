rxrpc: Fix a bit of time confusion

The rxrpc_reduce_call_timer() function should be passed the 'current time'
in jiffies, not the current ktime time.  It's confusing in rxrpc_resend
because that has to deal with both.  Pass the correct current time in.

Note that this only affects the trace produced and not the functioning of
the code.
