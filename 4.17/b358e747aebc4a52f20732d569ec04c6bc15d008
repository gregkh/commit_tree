media: rc: meson-ir: lower timeout and make configurable

A timeout of 200ms is much longer than necessary, and delays the decoding
decoding of a single scancode and the last scancode when a button is being
held. This makes the remote seem sluggish.

If the min_timeout and max_timeout values are set, the timeout is
configurable via the LIRC_SET_REC_TIMEOUT ioctl.
