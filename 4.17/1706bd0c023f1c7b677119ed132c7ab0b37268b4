KVM: VMX: remove CR0.WP from ..._ALWAYS_ON_UNRESTRICTED_GUEST

Unrestricted guest can only be enabled when EPT is enabled, and
when EPT is enabled, ept_update_paging_mode_cr0() will clear
hardware CR0.WP based on the guest's CR0.WP, i.e. CR0.WP always
follows the guest's value when unrestricted guest is enabled.
