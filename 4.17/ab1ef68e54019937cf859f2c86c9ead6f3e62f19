RISC-V: Add sections of PLT and GOT for kernel module

The address of external symbols will locate more than 32-bit offset
in 64-bit kernel with sv39 or sv48 virtual addressing.

Module loader emits the GOT and PLT entries for data symbols and
function symbols respectively.

The PLT entry is a trampoline code for jumping to the 64-bit
real address. The GOT entry is just the data symbol address.
