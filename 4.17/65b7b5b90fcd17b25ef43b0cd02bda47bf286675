net: Make cleanup_list and net::cleanup_list of llist type

This simplifies cleanup queueing and makes cleanup lists
to use llist primitives. Since llist has its own cmpxchg()
ordering, cleanup_list_lock is not more need.

Also, struct llist_node is smaller, than struct list_head,
so we save some bytes in struct net with this patch.
