usbip: usbip_host: fix NULL-ptr deref and use-after-free errors

usbip_host updates device status without holding lock from stub probe,
disconnect and rebind code paths. When multiple requests to import a
device are received, these unprotected code paths step all over each
other and drive fails with NULL-ptr deref and use-after-free errors.

The driver uses a table lock to protect the busid array for adding and
deleting busids to the table. However, the probe, disconnect and rebind
paths get the busid table entry and update the status without holding
the busid table lock. Add a new finer grain lock to protect the busid
entry. This new lock will be held to search and update the busid entry
fields from get_busid_idx(), add_match_busid() and del_match_busid().

match_busid_show() does the same to access the busid entry fields.

get_busid_priv() changed to return the pointer to the busid entry holding
the busid lock. stub_probe(), stub_disconnect() and stub_device_rebind()
call put_busid_priv() to release the busid lock before returning. This
changes fixes the unprotected code paths eliminating the race conditions
in updating the busid entries.
