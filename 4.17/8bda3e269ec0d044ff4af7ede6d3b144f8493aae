MIPS: Make the default for PHYSICAL_START always 64-bit

Make the default for PHYSICAL_START always 64-bit, ensuring that a
correct sign-extended value is used if a 32-bit image is loaded by a
64-bit system, and matching how the load address is set in platform
Makefile fragments (arch/mips/*/Platform) in the absence of the
PHYSICAL_START configuration option.

Of course PHYSICAL_START itself is a misnomer as the load address is
virtual rather than physical (or otherwise sign-extension would not
apply).
