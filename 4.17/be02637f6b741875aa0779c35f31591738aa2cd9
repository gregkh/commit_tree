dt-bindings: clock: ti: add latching support to mux and divider clocks

Certain hardware configurations, like dra76x, have some of the clock
registers partitioned in a funky manner that requires the clock
control setup to be latched for PRCM to be notified of the change. This
is accomplished with a separate control bit under the register. Add
support for this clock latching support to divider and mux clocks.
