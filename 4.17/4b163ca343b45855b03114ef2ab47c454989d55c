perf tests: Disable breakpoint accounting test for powerpc

We disable this test as instruction breakpoints (HW_BREAKPOINT_X) are
not available for powerpc.

Before applying patch:

  21: Breakpoint accounting                                 :
  --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 3635
  failed opening event 0
  failed opening event 0
  watchpoints count 1, breakpoints count 0, has_ioctl 1, share 0
  test child finished with -2
  ---- end ----
  Breakpoint accounting: Skip

After applying patch:

  21: Breakpoint accounting                                 : Disabled
