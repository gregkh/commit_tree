Users can define optional variables to get email notifications.
Ktest can send emails when the script:
 * was started
 * failed with fatal errors and called dodie()
 * completed all testing

Users have to setup the mailer provided in config prior to using this script.
Supported mailers: mailx, mail, sendmail
mailer specific routines are _sendmail_send(), _mailx_send()
