wil6210: support concurrency record in FW file

New FW which supports multiple virtual interfaces, reports
its allowed interface combinations using a special comment
record in the FW file. The format of the interface combinations
is similar to the kernel wiphy->iface_combinations.
When parsing FW file during module initialization, also parse
and validate the concurrency record, and initialize
wiphy->n_iface_combinations and wiphy->iface_combinations
accordingly.
