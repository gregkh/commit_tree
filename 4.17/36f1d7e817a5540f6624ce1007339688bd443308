mmc: slot-gpio: Add a function to enable/disable card detect IRQ wakeup

Commit 03dbaa04a2e5 ("mmc: slot-gpio: Add support to enable irq wake on
cd_irq") enabled wakeup at initialization. However drivers may wish to
enable and disable based on different criteria. Add a helper function
mmc_gpio_set_cd_wake() to make it easy for drivers to do that.
