af_key: Always verify length of provided sadb_key

Key extensions (struct sadb_key) include a user-specified number of key
bits.  The kernel uses that number to determine how much key data to copy
out of the message in pfkey_msg2xfrm_state().

The length of the sadb_key message must be verified to be long enough,
even in the case of SADB_X_AALG_NULL.  Furthermore, the sadb_key_len value
must be long enough to include both the key data and the struct sadb_key
itself.

Introduce a helper function verify_key_len(), and call it from
parse_exthdrs() where other exthdr types are similarly checked for
correctness.
