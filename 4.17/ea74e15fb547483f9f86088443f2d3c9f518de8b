drm/amd/display: Default HDMI6G support to true. Log VBIOS table error.

There have been many reports of Ellesmere and Baffin systems not being
able to drive HDMI 4k60 due to the fact that we check the HDMI_6GB_EN
bit from VBIOS table. Windows seems to not have this issue.

On some systems we fail to the encoder cap info from VBIOS. In that case
we should default to enabling HDMI6G support.
