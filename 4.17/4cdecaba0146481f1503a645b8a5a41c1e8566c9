KVM: arm64: Unify non-VHE host/guest sysreg save and restore functions

There is no need to have multiple identical functions with different
names for saving host and guest state.  When saving and restoring state
for the host and guest, the state is the same for both contexts, and
that's why we have the kvm_cpu_context structure.  Delete one
version and rename the other into simply save/restore.
