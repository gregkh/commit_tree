loop: don't call into filesystem while holding lo_ctl_mutex

We hit an issue where a loop device on NFS was stuck in
loop_get_status() doing vfs_getattr() after the NFS server died, which
caused a pile-up of uninterruptible processes waiting on lo_ctl_mutex.
There's no reason to hold this lock while we wait on the filesystem;
let's drop it so that other processes can do their thing. We need to
grab a reference on lo_backing_file while we use it, and we can get rid
of the check on lo_device, which has been unnecessary since commit
a34c0ae9ebd6 ("[PATCH] loop: remove the bio remapping capability") in
the linux-history tree.
