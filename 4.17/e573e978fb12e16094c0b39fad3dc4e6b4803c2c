perf cs-etm: Inject capabilitity for CoreSight traces

Added user space perf functionality to translate CoreSight traces into
instruction events with branch stack.

To invoke the new functionality, use the perf inject tool with
--itrace=il. For example, to translate the ETM trace from perf.data into
last branch records in a new inj.data file:

    $ perf inject --itrace=i100000il128 -i perf.data -o perf.data.new

The 'i' parameter to itrace generates periodic instruction events.  The
period between instruction events can be specified as a number of
instructions suffixed by i (default 100000).

The parameter to 'l' specifies the number of entries in the branch stack
attached to instruction events.

The 'b' parameter to itrace generates events on taken branches.

This patch also fixes the contents of the branch events used in perf
report - previously branch events were generated for each contiguous
range of instructions executed.  These are fixed to generate branch
events between the last address of a range ending in an executed branch
instruction and the start address of the next range.

Based on patches by Sebastian Pop <s.pop@samsung.com> with additional fixes
and support for specifying the instruction period.
