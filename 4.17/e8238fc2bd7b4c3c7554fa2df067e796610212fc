bridge: check iface upper dev when setting master via ioctl

When we set a bond slave's master to bridge via ioctl, we only check
the IFF_BRIDGE_PORT flag. Although we will find the slave's real master
at netdev_master_upper_dev_link() later, it already does some settings
and allocates some resources. It would be better to return as early
as possible.

v1 -> v2:
use netdev_master_upper_dev_get() instead of netdev_has_any_upper_dev()
to check if we have a master, because not all upper devs are masters,
e.g. vlan device.
