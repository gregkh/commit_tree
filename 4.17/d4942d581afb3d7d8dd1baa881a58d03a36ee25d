i40evf: Correctly populate rxitr_idx and txitr_idx

While testing code for the recent ITR changes I found that updating the Tx
ITR appeared to have no effect with everything defaulting to the Rx ITR. A
bit of digging narrowed it down the fact that we were asking the PF to
associate all causes with ITR 0 as we weren't populating the itr_idx values
for either Rx or Tx.

To correct it I have added the configuration for these values to this
patch. In addition I did some minor clean-up to just add a local pointer
for the vector map instead of dereferencing it based off of the index
repeatedly. In my opinion this makes the resultant code a bit more readable
and saves us a few characters.
