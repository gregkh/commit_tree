net: Convert netfilter_net_ops

Methods netfilter_net_init() and netfilter_net_exit()
initialize net::nf::hooks and change net-related proc
directory of net. Another pernet_operations are not
interested in forein net::nf::hooks or proc entries,
so it's safe to make them executed in parallel with
methods of other pernet operations.
