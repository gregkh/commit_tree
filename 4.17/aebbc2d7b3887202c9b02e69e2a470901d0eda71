drm/i915/execlists: Move irq state manipulation inside irq disabled region

Although this state (execlists->active and engine->irq_posted) itself is
not protected by the engine->timeline spinlock, it does conveniently
ensure that irqs are disabled. We can use this to protect our
manipulation of the state and so ensure that the next IRQ to arrive sees
consistent state and (hopefully) ignores the reset engine.
