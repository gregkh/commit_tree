pidns: simpler allocation of pid_* caches

Those pid_* caches are created on demand when a process advances to the new
level of pid namespace. Which means pointers are stable, write only and
thus can be packed into an array instead of spreading them over and using
lists(!) to find them.

Both first and subsequent clone/unshare(CLONE_NEWPID) become faster.
