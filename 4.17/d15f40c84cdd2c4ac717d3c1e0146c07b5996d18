drm/uapi: Deprecate DRM_MODE_FLAG_PIXMUX

Reject any mode with DRM_MODE_FLAG_PIXMUX. We have no code that even
checks for this flag hence it can't possibly do any good.

Looks like this flag had something to do the the controller<->ramdac
interface with some ancient S3 graphics adapters. Why someone though
it would be a good idea to expose it directly to users I don't know.
And later on it got copied into the randr protocol and kms uapi.
