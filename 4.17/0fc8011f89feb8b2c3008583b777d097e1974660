drm/amdkfd: Kmap event page for dGPUs

The events page must be accessible in user mode by the GPU and CPU
as well as in kernel mode by the CPU. On dGPUs user mode virtual
addresses are managed by the Thunk's GPU memory allocation code.
Therefore we can't allocate the memory in kernel mode like we do
on APUs. But KFD still needs to map the memory for kernel access.
To facilitate this, the Thunk provides the buffer handle of the
events page to KFD when creating the first event.
