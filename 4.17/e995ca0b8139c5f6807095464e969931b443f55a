drm/i915: Provide a device level .mode_valid() hook

We never support certain mode flags etc. Reject those early on in the
mode_config.mode_valid() hook. That allows us to remove some duplicated
checks from the connector .mode_valid() hooks, and it guarantees that
we never see those flags even from user mode as the
mode_config.mode_valid() hooks gets executed for those as well.
