libbpf: Support expected_attach_type at prog load

Support setting `expected_attach_type` at prog load time in both
`bpf/bpf.h` and `bpf/libbpf.h`.

Since both headers already have API to load programs, new functions are
added not to break backward compatibility for existing ones:
* `bpf_load_program_xattr()` is added to `bpf/bpf.h`;
* `bpf_prog_load_xattr()` is added to `bpf/libbpf.h`.

Both new functions accept structures, `struct bpf_load_program_attr` and
`struct bpf_prog_load_attr` correspondingly, where new fields can be
added in the future w/o changing the API.

Standard `_xattr` suffix is used to name the new API functions.

Since `bpf_load_program_name()` is not used as heavily as
`bpf_load_program()`, it was removed in favor of more generic
`bpf_load_program_xattr()`.
