powerpc/64s: Allocate LPPACAs individually

We no longer allocate lppacas in an array, so this patch removes the
1kB static alignment for the structure, and enforces the PAPR
alignment requirements at allocation time. We can not reduce the 1kB
allocation size however, due to existing KVM hypervisors.
