x86/tsc: Prevent 32bit truncation in calc_hpet_ref()

The TSC calibration code uses HPET as reference. The conversion normalizes
the delta of two HPET timestamps:

    hpetref = ((tshpet1 - tshpet2) * HPET_PERIOD) / 1e6

and then divides the normalized delta of the corresponding TSC timestamps
by the result to calulate the TSC frequency.

    tscfreq = ((tstsc1 - tstsc2 ) * 1e6) / hpetref

This uses do_div() which takes an u32 as the divisor, which worked so far
because the HPET frequency was low enough that 'hpetref' never exceeded
32bit.

On Skylake machines the HPET frequency increased so 'hpetref' can exceed
32bit. do_div() truncates the divisor, which causes the calibration to
fail.

Use div64_u64() to avoid the problem.
