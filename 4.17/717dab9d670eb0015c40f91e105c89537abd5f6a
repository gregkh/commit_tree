phy: qcom-qmp: Power-on PHY before initialization

PHY regulators which are enabled from power_on() must be ON
before turning-on clocks and initializing it as part of init().
As most of the core drivers perform power_on() after init(), move
PHY regulators enable to com_init() and use power_on() to
only enable pipe_clk. This pipe_clk is output from PHY and some
core drivers e.g. PCIe follow specific sequence after phy_init()
that mandates pipe_clk to be enabled from power_on() only.
On similar lines move clk_enable from init() to com_init() which
executes once for multi lane PHYs.
