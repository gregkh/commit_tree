btrfs: Move qgroup rescan on quota enable to btrfs_quota_enable

Currently btrfs_run_qgroups is doing a bit too much. Not only is it
responsible for synchronizing in-memory state of qgroups to disk but
it also contains code to trigger the initial qgroup rescan when
quota is enabled initially. This condition is detected by checking that
BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED is not set and BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLING is set.
Nothing really requires from the code to be structured (and scattered)
the way it is so let's streamline things. First move the quota rescan
code into btrfs_quota_enable, where its invocation is closer to the
use. This also makes the FS_QUOTA_ENABLING flag redundant so let's
remove it as well.

This has been tested with a full xfstest run with qgroups enabled on
the scratch device of every xfstest and no regressions were observed.
