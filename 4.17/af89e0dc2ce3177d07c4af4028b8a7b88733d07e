btrfs: Don't hardcode the csum size in btrfs_ordered_sum_size

Currently the function uses a hardcoded value for the checksum size of
a sector. This is fine, given that we currently support only a single
algorithm, whose checksum is 4 bytes == sizeof(u32). Despite not
having other algorithms, btrfs' design supports using a different
algorithm whith different space requirements. To future-proof the code
query the size of the currently used algorithm from the in-memory copy
of the super block. No functional changes.
