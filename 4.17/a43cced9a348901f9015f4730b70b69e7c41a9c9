rds: MP-RDS may use an invalid c_path

rds_sendmsg() calls rds_send_mprds_hash() to find a c_path to use to
send a message.  Suppose the RDS connection is not yet up.  In
rds_send_mprds_hash(), it does

	if (conn->c_npaths == 0)
		wait_event_interruptible(conn->c_hs_waitq,
					 (conn->c_npaths != 0));

If it is interrupted before the connection is set up,
rds_send_mprds_hash() will return a non-zero hash value.  Hence
rds_sendmsg() will use a non-zero c_path to send the message.  But if
the RDS connection ends up to be non-MP capable, the message will be
lost as only the zero c_path can be used.
