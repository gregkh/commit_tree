torture: Adjust rcuperf trace processing to allow for workqueues

The rcuperf event-trace processing assumes that expedited grace periods
start and end on the same task, an assumption that was violated by moving
expedited grace-period processing to workqueues.  This commit removes
this now-fallacious assumption from rcuperf's event-trace processing.
