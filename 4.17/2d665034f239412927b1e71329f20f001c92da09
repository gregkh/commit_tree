net: ip6_gre: Fix ip6erspan hlen calculation

Even though ip6erspan_tap_init() sets up hlen and tun_hlen according to
what ERSPAN needs, it goes ahead to call ip6gre_tnl_link_config() which
overwrites these settings with GRE-specific ones.

Similarly for changelink callbacks, which are handled by
ip6gre_changelink() calls ip6gre_tnl_change() calls
ip6gre_tnl_link_config() as well.

The difference ends up being 12 vs. 20 bytes, and this is generally not
a problem, because a 12-byte request likely ends up allocating more and
the extra 8 bytes are thus available. However correct it is not.

So replace the newlink and changelink callbacks with an ERSPAN-specific
ones, reusing the newly-introduced _common() functions.
