ASoC: adau17x1: Use empty struct initializer

{ 0 } only clears the first member of the structure.

The first member of the snd_soc_dapm_update struct is a pointer,
and writing 0 to a pointer results in a sparse warning.

Use the empty struct initializer that clears all the struct members
and fixes the sparse warning.
