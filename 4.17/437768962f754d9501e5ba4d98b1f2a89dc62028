serial: imx: Only handle irqs that are actually enabled

Handling an irq that isn't enabled can have some undesired side effects.
Some of these are mentioned in the newly introduced code comment. Some
of the irq sources already had their handling right, some don't. Handle
them all in the same consistent way.

The change for USR1_RRDY and USR1_AGTIM drops the check for
dma_is_enabled. This is correct as UCR1_RRDYEN and UCR2_ATEN are always
off if dma is enabled.
