KVM: s390: implement CPU model only facilities

Some facilities should only be provided to the guest, if they are
enabled by a CPU model. This allows us to avoid capabilities and
to simply fall back to the cpumodel for deciding about a facility
without enabling it for older QEMUs or QEMUs without a CPU
model.
