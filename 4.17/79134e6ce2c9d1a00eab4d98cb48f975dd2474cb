net: do not create fallback tunnels for non-default namespaces

fallback tunnels (like tunl0, gre0, gretap0, erspan0, sit0,
ip6tnl0, ip6gre0) are automatically created when the corresponding
module is loaded.

These tunnels are also automatically created when a new network
namespace is created, at a great cost.

In many cases, netns are used for isolation purposes, and these
extra network devices are a waste of resources. We are using
thousands of netns per host, and hit the netns creation/delete
bottleneck a lot. (Many thanks to Kirill for recent work on this)

Add a new sysctl so that we can opt-out from this automatic creation.

Note that these tunnels are still created for the initial namespace,
to be the least intrusive for typical setups.

Tested:
lpk43:~# cat add_del_unshare.sh
for i in `seq 1 40`
do
 (for j in `seq 1 100` ; do  unshare -n /bin/true >/dev/null ; done) &
done
wait

lpk43:~# echo 0 >/proc/sys/net/core/fb_tunnels_only_for_init_net
lpk43:~# time ./add_del_unshare.sh

real	0m37.521s
user	0m0.886s
sys	7m7.084s
lpk43:~# echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/core/fb_tunnels_only_for_init_net
lpk43:~# time ./add_del_unshare.sh

real	0m4.761s
user	0m0.851s
sys	1m8.343s
