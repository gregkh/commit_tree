perf tests shell lib: Use a wildcard to remove the vfs_getname probe

In some situations the vfs_getname is being added both as requested and
with a _1 suffix (inlines?):

  probe:vfs_getname_1  (on getname_flags:63@acme/git/linux/fs/namei.c with pathname)

This ends up making the cleanup to miss that one, as it removes just
'probe:vfs_getname', which makes the second test to use this probe point
to fail, since it finds that leftover from the first test, use a
wildcard to remove both.

Before:

  # perf test 60 61 62 63
  60: Use vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames   : FAILED!
  61: probe libc's inet_pton & backtrace it with ping       : Ok
  62: Check open filename arg using perf trace + vfs_getname: FAILED!
  63: Add vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames   : Ok

After:

  # perf test 60 61 62 63
  60: Use vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames   : Ok
  61: probe libc's inet_pton & backtrace it with ping       : Ok
  62: Check open filename arg using perf trace + vfs_getname: Ok
  63: Add vfs_getname probe to get syscall args filenames   : Ok
