drm/i915/cnl: Add Cannonlake PCI IDs for another SKU.

The only difference is that this SKUs has the full
Port A/E split named as Port F.

But since SKUs differences don't matter on the platform
definition group and ids, let's merge all off them together.

v2: Really include the PCI IDs to the picidlist[];
v3: Add the PCI Id for another SKU (Anusha).
v4: Update IDs, really include to pciidlists again.
v5: Unify all GT2 IDs.
v6: Unify in a way that we don't break early-quirks.c
v7: Remove GT reference since it doesn't matter here (Paulo)
    Also move IS_CNL_WITH_PORT_F macro to this patch to
    make it easier for review this part and also to get
    used sooner.
v8: Rebased on top of commit 5db47e37b387 ("Revert "drm/i915:
mark all device info struct with __initconst"")
