f2fs: remain written times to update inode during fsync

This fixes xfstests/generic/392.

The failure was caused by different times between 1) one marked in the last
fsync(2) call and 2) the other given by roll-forward recovery after power-cut.
The reason was that we skipped updating inode block at 1), since its i_size
was recoverable along with 4KB-aligned data writes, which was fixed by:
  "f2fs: fix a wrong condition in f2fs_skip_inode_update"
