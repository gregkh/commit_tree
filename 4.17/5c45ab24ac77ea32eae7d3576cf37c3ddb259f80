tipc: make struct tipc_server private for server.c

In order to narrow the interface and dependencies between the topology
server and the subscription/binding table functionality we move struct
tipc_server inside the file server.c. This requires some code
adaptations in other files, but those are mostly minor.

The most important change is that we have to move the start/stop
functions for the topology server to server.c, where they logically
belong anyway.
