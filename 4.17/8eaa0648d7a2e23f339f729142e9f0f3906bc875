ARM: sun9i: smp: Support cpu0 hotplug

The BROM has a branch that checks if the primary core is hotplugging.
If the magic flag is set, execution jumps to the address set in the
software entry register. (Secondary cores always branch to the that
address.)

This patch sets the flags that makes BROM jump execution on the
primary core (cpu0) to the SMP software entry code when the core is
powered back up. After it is re-integrated into the system, the flag
is cleared.

A custom .cpu_can_disable callback that returns true for all cpus,
so that cpu0 can really be brought down.
