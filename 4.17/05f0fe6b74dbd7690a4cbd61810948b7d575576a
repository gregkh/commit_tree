RCU, workqueue: Implement rcu_work

There are cases where RCU callback needs to be bounced to a sleepable
context.  This is currently done by the RCU callback queueing a work
item, which can be cumbersome to write and confusing to read.

This patch introduces rcu_work, a workqueue work variant which gets
executed after a RCU grace period, and converts the open coded
bouncing in fs/aio and kernel/cgroup.

v3: Dropped queue_rcu_work_on().  Documented rcu grace period behavior
    after queue_rcu_work().

v2: Use rcu_barrier() instead of synchronize_rcu() to wait for
    completion of previously queued rcu callback as per Paul.
