radix tree test suite: fix mapshift build target

Commit c6ce3e2fe3da ("radix tree test suite: Add config option for map
shift") introduced a phony makefile target called 'mapshift' that ends
up generating the file generated/map-shift.h.  This phony target was
then added as a dependency of the top level 'targets' build target,
which is what is run when you go to tools/testing/radix-tree and just
type 'make'.

Unfortunately, this phony target doesn't actually work as a dependency,
so you end up getting:

  $ make
  make: *** No rule to make target 'generated/map-shift.h', needed by 'main.o'.  Stop.
  make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

Fix this by making the file generated/map-shift.h our real makefile
target, and add this a dependency of the top level build target.
