1. Provides infrastructure for vector IO using recvmmsg/sendmmsg.
    1.1. Multi-message read.
    1.2. Multi-message write.
    1.3. Optimized queue support for multi-packet enqueue/dequeue.

    than existing pcap based transport (> 4Gbit)
    2.2. New tap transport using socket RX and tap xmit. Similar
    performance improvements (>4Gbit)
    2.3. GRE transport - direct wiring to GRE PWE
    2.4. L2TPv3 transport - direct wiring to L2TPv3 PWE
3. Tuning, performance and offload related setting support via ethtool.
4. Initial BPF support - used in tap/raw to avoid software looping
5. Scatter Gather support.
6. VNET and checksum offload support for raw socket transport.
7. TSO/GSO support where applicable or available
