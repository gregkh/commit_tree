drm/i915/error: standardize function style in error capture

some of the static functions used from capture() have the "i915_"
prefix while other don't; most of them take i915 as a parameter, but one
of them derives it internally from error->i915. Let's be consistent by
avoiding prefix for static functions and by getting i915 from
error->i915. While at it, s/dev_priv/i915 in functions that don't
perform register reads.

v2: take i915 from error->i915 (Michal), s/dev_priv/i915,
