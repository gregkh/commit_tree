drm/amd/display: Convert CTM to 2's complement

DRM's documentation for the color transform matrix does not specify
whether the values are in signed-magnitude, or 2's complement.
Therefore, it was assumed to use 2's complement.

However, existing usermode implementations use signed-magnitude.
Therefore, conform to existing standards, and convert to 2's complement
internally.
