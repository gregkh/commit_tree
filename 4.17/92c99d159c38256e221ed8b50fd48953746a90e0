cpufreq: Don't validate cpufreq table from cpufreq_generic_init()

The cpufreq table is already validated by the cpufreq core and none of
the users of cpufreq_generic_init() have any dependency on it to
validate the table as well.

Don't validate the cpufreq table anymore from cpufreq_generic_init().
