nfsd: Add I/O trace points in the NFSv4 read proc

NFSv4 read compound processing invokes nfsd_splice_read and
nfs_readv directly, so the trace points currently in nfsd_read are
not invoked for NFSv4 reads.

Move the NFSD READ trace points to common helpers so that NFSv4
reads are captured.

Also, record any local I/O error that occurs, the total count of
bytes that were actually returned, and whether splice or vectored
read was used.
