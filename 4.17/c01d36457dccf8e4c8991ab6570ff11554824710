NFSv4: Don't return the delegation when not needed by NFSv4.x (x>0)

Starting with NFSv4.1, the server is able to deduce the client id from
the SEQUENCE op which means it can always figure out whether or not
the client is holding a delegation on a file that is being changed.
For that reason, RFC5661 does not require a delegation to be unconditionally
recalled on operations such as SETATTR, RENAME, or REMOVE.

Note that for now, we continue to return READ delegations since that is
still expected by the Linux knfsd server.
