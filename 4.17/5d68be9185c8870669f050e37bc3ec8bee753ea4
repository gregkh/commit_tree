drm/sun4i: backend: Use runtime_pm variant of atomic_commit_tail

During a hardware commit, the commit bit in the backend will only be
cleared if the TCON is enabled. Use the runtime_pm variant of the
atomic_commit_tail hook that makes sure that the CRTC, our TCON, is enabled
when we perform an atomic_commit.
