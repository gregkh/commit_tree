powerpc/xmon: Setup debugger hooks when first break-point is set

Presently sysrq key for xmon('x') is registered during kernel init
irrespective of the value of kernel param 'xmon'. Thus xmon is enabled
even if 'xmon=off' is passed on the kernel command line. However this
doesn't enable the kernel debugger hooks needed for instruction or
data breakpoints. Thus when a break-point is hit with xmon=off a
kernel oops of the form below is reported:

  Oops: Exception in kernel mode, sig: 5 [#1]
  < snip >
  Trace/breakpoint trap

To fix this the patch checks and enables debugger hooks when an
instruction or data break-point is set via xmon console.
