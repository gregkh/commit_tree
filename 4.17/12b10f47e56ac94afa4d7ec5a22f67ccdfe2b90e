pinctrl/amd: add get_direction handler

On boot, gpiochip_add_data() initializes the FLAG_IS_OUT bit in
desc->flags iff its gpio_chip does not have ->direction_input() handler,
else it is initialized to 0, which implies the GPIO is an "input".

Later, the sysfs "direction" handler will use gpiod_get_direction() to
get the current direction, but if no ->get_direction() handler is
installed, the result will just be the current (initial) value of flags,
which will always be OUT irregardless of the initial register value.

Add a get_direction() handler to pinctrl-amd to fix this and always
provide the correct value for direction.
