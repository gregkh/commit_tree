i2c: qup: fix buffer overflow for multiple msg of maximum xfer len

The BAM mode requires buffer for start tag data and tx, rx SG
list. Currently, this is being taken for maximum transfer length
(65K). But an I2C transfer can have multiple messages and each
message can be of this maximum length so the buffer overflow will
happen in this case. Since increasing buffer length wonâ€™t be
feasible since an I2C transfer can contain any number of messages
so this patch does following changes to make i2c transfers working
for multiple messages case.

1. Calculate the required buffers for 2 maximum length messages
   (65K * 2).
2. Split the descriptor formation and descriptor scheduling.
   The idea is to fit as many messages in one DMA transfers for 65K
   threshold value (max_xfer_sg_len). Whenever the sg_cnt is
   crossing this, then schedule the BAM transfer and subsequent
   transfer will again start from zero.
