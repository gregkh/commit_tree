mtd: spi-nor: cadence-quadspi: Fix page fault kernel panic

The current Cadence QSPI driver caused a kernel panic when loading
a Root Filesystem from QSPI. The problem was caused by reading more
bytes than needed because the QSPI operated on 4 bytes at a time.

</snip>
Notice above how only 1 byte needed to be read but by reading 4 bytes
into the end of a mapped page, an unrecoverable page fault occurred.

This patch uses a temporary buffer to hold the 4 bytes read and then
copies only the bytes required into the buffer. A min() function is
used to limit the length to prevent buffer overflows.

Request testing of this patch on other platforms. This was tested
on the Intel Arria10 SoCFPGA DevKit.
