bpf: sockmap, map_release does not hold refcnt for pinned maps

Relying on map_release hook to decrement the reference counts when a
map is removed only works if the map is not being pinned. In the
pinned case the ref is decremented immediately and the BPF programs
released. After this BPF programs may not be in-use which is not
what the user would expect.

This patch moves the release logic into bpf_map_put_uref() and brings
sockmap in-line with how a similar case is handled in prog array maps.
