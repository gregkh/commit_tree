afs: Fix server record deletion

AFS server records get removed from the net->fs_servers tree when
they're deleted, but not from the net->fs_addresses{4,6} lists, which
can lead to an oops in afs_find_server() when a server record has been
removed, for instance during rmmod.

Fix this by deleting the record from the by-address lists before posting
it for RCU destruction.

The reason this hasn't been noticed before is that the fileserver keeps
probing the local cache manager, thereby keeping the service record
alive, so the oops would only happen when a fileserver eventually gets
bored and stops pinging or if the module gets rmmod'd and a call comes
in from the fileserver during the window between the server records
being destroyed and the socket being closed.

The oops looks something like:
