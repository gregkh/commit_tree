netfilter: ebtables: Add support for specifying match revision

Currently ebtables assumes that the revision number of all match
modules is 0, which is an issue when trying to use existing
xtables matches with ebtables. The solution is to modify ebtables
to allow extensions to specify a revision number, similar to
iptables. This gets passed down to the kernel, which is then able
to find the match module correctly.

To main binary backwards compatibility, the size of the ebt_entry
structures is not changed, only the size of the name field is
decreased by 1 byte to make room for the revision field.
