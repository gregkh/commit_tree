UNREACHABLE_CODE: This statement in the source code might be unreachable
during program execution.
[unreachable] unreachable at drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/analogix/analogix_dp_core.c:787
retval != 0 is always false because at this program point the variable retval
is always equal to 0 at drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/analogix/analogix_dp_core.c:786
