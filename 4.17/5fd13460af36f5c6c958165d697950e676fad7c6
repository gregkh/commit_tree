powerpc/eeh: Clarify arguments to eeh_reset_device()

It is currently difficult to understand the behaviour of
eeh_reset_device() due to the way it's parameters are used. In
particular, when 'bus' is NULL, it's value is still necessary so the
same value is looked up again locally under a different name
('frozen_bus') but behaviour is changed.

To clarify this, add a new parameter 'driver_eeh_aware', and have the
caller set it when it would have passed NULL for 'bus' and always pass
a value for 'bus'. Then change any test that was on 'bus' to one on
'!driver_eeh_aware' and replace uses of 'frozen_bus' with 'bus'.

Also update the function's comment.

This should not change behaviour.
