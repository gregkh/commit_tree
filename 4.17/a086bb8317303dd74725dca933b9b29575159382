i2c: i801: Save register SMBSLVCMD value only once

Saving the original value of register SMBSLVCMD in
i801_enable_host_notify() doesn't work, because this function is
called not only at probe time but also at resume time. Do it in
i801_probe() instead, so that the saved value is not overwritten at
resume time.
