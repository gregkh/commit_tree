crypto: arm64/aes-blk - add 4 way interleave to CBC-MAC encrypt path

CBC MAC is strictly sequential, and so the current AES code simply
processes the input one block at a time. However, we are about to add
yield support, which adds a bit of overhead, and which we prefer to
align with other modes in terms of granularity (i.e., it is better to
have all routines yield every 64 bytes and not have an exception for
CBC MAC which yields every 16 bytes)

So unroll the loop by 4. We still cannot perform the AES algorithm in
parallel, but we can at least merge the loads and stores.
