net: mvpp2: Fix TCAM filter reserved range

Marvell's PPv2 controller has a Packet Header parser, which uses a
fixed-size TCAM array of filter entries.

The mvpp2 driver reserves some ranges among the 256 TCAM entries to
perform MAC and VID filtering. The rest of the TCAM ids are freely usable
for other features, such as IPv4 proto matching.

This commit fixes the MVPP2_PE_LAST_FREE_TID define that sets the end of
the "free range", which included the MAC range. This could therefore allow
some other features to use entries dedicated to MAC filtering,
lowering the number of unicast/multicast addresses that could be allowed
before switching to promiscuous mode.
