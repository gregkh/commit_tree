mtd: rawnand: move calls to ->select_chip() in nand_setup_data_interface()

After a ->set_features(TIMINGS), the chip is supposed to be working at a
new speed. In order for all the transactions to be perperly handled, the
NAND controller should also be configured to this same speed. Calling
->setup_data_interface() is not enough and the chip should be
de-asserted/re-asserted through calls to ->select_chip().

Prepare the next change in nand_setup_data_interface() where timings
will be checked after being applied. Because assertions of the CS pin
will be needed from within this function, move the calls to
->select_chip() inside nand_setup_data_interface() for later
consistency.
