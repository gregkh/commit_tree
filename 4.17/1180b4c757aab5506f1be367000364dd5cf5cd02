apparmor: fix dangling symlinks to policy rawdata after replacement

When policy replacement occurs the symlinks in the profile directory
need to be updated to point to the new rawdata, otherwise once the
old rawdata is removed the symlink becomes broken.

Fix this by dynamically generating the symlink everytime it is read.
These links are used enough that their value needs to be cached and
this way we can avoid needing locking to read and update the link
value.
