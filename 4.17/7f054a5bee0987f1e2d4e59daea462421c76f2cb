ALSA: opl3: Hardening for potential Spectre v1

As recently Smatch suggested, one place in OPL3 driver may expand the
array directly from the user-space value with speculation:
  sound/drivers/opl3/opl3_synth.c:476 snd_opl3_set_voice() warn: potential spectre issue 'snd_opl3_regmap'

This patch puts array_index_nospec() for hardening against it.
