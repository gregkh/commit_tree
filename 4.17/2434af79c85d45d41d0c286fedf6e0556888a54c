blk-mq: Revert "blk-mq: reimplement blk_mq_hw_queue_mapped"

This reverts commit 127276c6ce5a30fcc806b7fe53015f4f89b62956.

When all CPUs of one hw queue become offline, there still may have IOs
not completed from this hctx. But blk_mq_hw_queue_mapped() is called in
blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter(), which is used for iterating request in timeout
handler, timeout event will be missed on the inactive hctx, then request may
never be completed.

Also the replementation of blk_mq_hw_queue_mapped() doesn't match the helper's
name any more, and it should have been named as blk_mq_hw_queue_active().

Even other callers need further verification about this reimplemenation.

So revert this patch now, and we can improve hw queue activate/inactivate event
after adequent researching and test.
