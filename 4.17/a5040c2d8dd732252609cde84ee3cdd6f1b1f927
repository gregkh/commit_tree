blktrace: fix comment in blktrace_api.h

The `__u64 time` field of the blk_io_trace struct refers to
the time in nanoseconds, not in microseconds. It is set in
__blk_add_trace, which does the following:

    t->time = ktime_to_ns(ktime_get());

ktime_to_ns returns ktime_t in nanoseconds, not microseconds.
