mm: remove blackfin MPU support

The CONFIG_MPU option was only defined on blackfin, and that architecture
is now being removed, so the respective code can be simplified.

A lot of other microcontrollers have an MPU, but I suspect that if we
want to bring that support back, we'd do it differently anyway.
