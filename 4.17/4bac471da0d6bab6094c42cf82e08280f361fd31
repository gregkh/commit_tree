thunderbolt: Add support for Intel Titan Ridge

Intel Titan Ridge is the next Thunderbolt 3 controller. The ICM firmware
message format in Titan Ridge differs from Falcon Ridge and Alpine Ridge
somewhat because it is using route strings addressing devices. In
addition to that the DMA port of 4-channel (two port) controller is in
different port number than the previous controllers. There are some
other minor differences as well.

This patch add support for Intel Titan Ridge and the new ICM firmware
message format.
