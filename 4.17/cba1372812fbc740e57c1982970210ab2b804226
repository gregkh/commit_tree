phy: amlogic: phy-meson-gxl-usb2: don't log an error on -EPROBE_DEFER

devm_phy_create can return -EPROBE_DEFER if the phy-supply is not ready
yet. Silence this warning as the driver framework will re-attempt
registering the PHY - this second try works without any errors. So only
log actual errors to keep the kernel log free of misleading error
messages.
