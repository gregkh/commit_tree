tracing: Add hist trigger action hook

Add a hook for executing extra actions whenever a histogram entry is
added or updated.

The default 'action' when a hist entry is added to a histogram is to
update the set of values associated with it.  Some applications may
want to perform additional actions at that point, such as generate
another event, or compare and save a maximum.

Add a simple framework for doing that; specific actions will be
implemented on top of it in later patches.
