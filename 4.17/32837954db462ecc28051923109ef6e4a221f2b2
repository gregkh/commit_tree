perf/arm-cci: Clean up model discovery

Since I am the self-appointed of_device_get_match_data() police, it's
only right that I should clean up this driver while I'm otherwise
touching it. This also reveals that we're passing around a struct
platform_device in places where we only ever care about its regular
device, so straighten that out in the process.
