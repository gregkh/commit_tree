ARM: dts: logicpd-som-lv: Fix WL127x Startup Issues

The VAUX3 rail from the PMIC powers a clock driver which clocks
the WL127x. This corrects a bug which did not correctly associate
the vin-supply with the proper power rail.

This also fixes a typo in the pinmuxing to properly configure the
interrupt pin.
