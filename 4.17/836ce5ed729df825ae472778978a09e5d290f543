i40evf: Fix link up issue when queues are disabled

One of the previous patch fixes the link up issue by ignoring it if
i40evf is not in __I40EVF_RUNNING state. However this doesn't fix the
race condition when queues are disabled esp for ADq on VF. Hence check
if all queues are enabled before starting all queues.
