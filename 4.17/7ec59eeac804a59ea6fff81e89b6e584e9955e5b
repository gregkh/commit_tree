ice: Add support for control queues

A control queue is a hardware interface which is used by the driver
to interact with other subsystems (like firmware, PHY, etc.). It is
implemented as a producer-consumer ring. More specifically, an
"admin queue" is a type of control queue used to interact with the
firmware.

This patch introduces data structures and functions to initialize
and teardown control/admin queues. Once the admin queue is initialized,
the driver uses it to get the firmware version.
