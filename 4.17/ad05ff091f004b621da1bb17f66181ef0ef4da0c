media: s5h14*.h: fix typos for CONTINUOUS

There is a typo at the several s5h14*.h headers: continuous were
spelled incorrectly.

Fix it with this script:

for i in $(git grep -l S5H1409_MPEGTIMING_CONTINOUS_NONINVERTING_CLOCK); do
	sed s,S5H1409_MPEGTIMING_CONTINOUS_NONINVERTING_CLOCK,S5H1409_MPEGTIMING_CONTINUOUS_NONINVERTING_CLOCK,g -i $i
done
for i in $(git grep -l -i continous drivers/media); do sed s,CONTINOUS,CONTINUOUS,g -i $i; done
