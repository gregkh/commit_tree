nfp: modify app MTU setting callbacks

Rename the 'change_mtu' app callback to 'check_mtu'. This is called
whenever an MTU change is requested on a netdev. It can reject the
change but is not responsible for implementing it.

Introduce a new 'repr_change_mtu' app callback that is hit when the MTU
of a repr is to be changed. This is responsible for performing the MTU
change and verifying it.
