media: staging: atomisp: remove an useless check

There's a check at ia_css_vf_configure() to verify if
binary is not null. However, this is called too late:
	drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp2/css2400/isp/kernels/vf/vf_1.0/ia_css_vf.host.c:133 ia_css_vf_configure() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'binary' (see line 129)

This test is wrong, as this fuction is only called by
ia_css_binary_fill_info(), in a place that already assumes that
binary is not null, and checks with:
	assert(binary != NULL);

So, remove the useless broken extra check.
