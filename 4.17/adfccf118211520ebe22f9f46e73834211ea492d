net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Add missing g1 IRQ numbers

With the recent change to polling for interrupts, it is important that
the number of global 1 interrupts is listed. Without it, the driver
requests an interrupt domain for zero interrupts, which returns
EINVAL, and the probe fails.

Add two missing entries.
