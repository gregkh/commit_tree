rds: use list structure to track information for zerocopy completion notification

Commit 401910db4cd4 ("rds: deliver zerocopy completion notification
with data") removes support fo r zerocopy completion notification
on the sk_error_queue, thus we no longer need to track the cookie
information in sk_buff structures.

This commit removes the struct sk_buff_head rs_zcookie_queue by
a simpler list that results in a smaller memory footprint as well
as more efficient memory_allocation time.
