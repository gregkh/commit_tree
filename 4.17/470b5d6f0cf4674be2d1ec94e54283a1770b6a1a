USB: serial: ftdi_sio: use jtag quirk for Arrow USB Blaster

Arrow USB Blaster integrated on MAX1000 board uses the same vendor ID
(0x0403) and product ID (0x6010) as the "original" FTDI device.

This patch avoids picking up by ftdi_sio of the first interface of this
USB device. After that this device can be used by Arrow user-space JTAG
driver.
