KVM: VMX: No need to clear pending NMI/interrupt on inject realmode interrupt

kvm_inject_realmode_interrupt() is called from one of the injection
functions which writes event-injection to VMCS: vmx_queue_exception(),
vmx_inject_irq() and vmx_inject_nmi().

All these functions are called just to cause an event-injection to
guest. They are not responsible of manipulating the event-pending
flag. The only purpose of kvm_inject_realmode_interrupt() should be
to emulate real-mode interrupt-injection.

This was also incorrect when called from vmx_queue_exception().
