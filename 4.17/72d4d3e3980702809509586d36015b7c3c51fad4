netfilter: Fix handling simultaneous open in TCP conntrack

Dominique Martinet reported a TCP hang problem when simultaneous open was used.
The problem is that the tcp_conntracks state table is not smart enough
to handle the case. The state table could be fixed by introducing a new state,
but that would require more lines of code compared to this patch, due to the
required backward compatibility with ctnetlink.
