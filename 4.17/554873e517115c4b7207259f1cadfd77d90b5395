net: Do not take net_rwsem in __rtnl_link_unregister()

This function calls call_netdevice_notifier(), which also
may take net_rwsem. So, we can't use net_rwsem here.

This patch makes callers of this functions take pernet_ops_rwsem,
like register_netdevice_notifier() does. This will protect
the modifications of net_namespace_list, and allows notifiers
to take it (they won't have to care about context).

Since __rtnl_link_unregister() is used on module load
and unload (which are not frequent operations), this looks
for me better, than make all call_netdevice_notifier()
always executing in "protected net_namespace_list" context.

Also, this fixes the problem we had a deal in 328fbe747ad4
"Close race between {un, }register_netdevice_notifier and ...",
and guarantees __rtnl_link_unregister() does not skip
exitting net.
