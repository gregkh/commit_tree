ath9k: Protect queue draining by rcu_read_lock()

When ath9k was switched over to use the mac80211 intermediate queues,
node cleanup now drains the mac80211 queues. However, this call path is
not protected by rcu_read_lock() as it was previously entirely internal
to the driver which uses its own locking.

This leads to a possible rcu_dereference() without holding
rcu_read_lock(); but only if a station is cleaned up while having
packets queued on the TXQ. Fix this by adding the rcu_read_lock() to the
caller in ath9k.
