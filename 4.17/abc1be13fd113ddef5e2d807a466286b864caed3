mm/filemap.c: fix NULL pointer in page_cache_tree_insert()

f2fs specifies the __GFP_ZERO flag for allocating some of its pages.
Unfortunately, the page cache also uses the mapping's GFP flags for
allocating radix tree nodes.  It always masked off the __GFP_HIGHMEM
flag, and masks off __GFP_ZERO in some paths, but not all.  That causes
radix tree nodes to be allocated with a NULL list_head, which causes
backtraces like:

  __list_del_entry+0x30/0xd0
  list_lru_del+0xac/0x1ac
  page_cache_tree_insert+0xd8/0x110

The __GFP_DMA and __GFP_DMA32 flags would also be able to sneak through
if they are ever used.  Fix them all by using GFP_RECLAIM_MASK at the
innermost location, and remove it from earlier in the callchain.
