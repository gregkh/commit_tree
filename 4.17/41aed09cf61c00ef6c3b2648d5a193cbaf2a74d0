nfp: bpf: add support for atomic add of unknown values

Allow atomic add to be used even when the value is not guaranteed
to fit into a 16 bit immediate.  This requires the value to be pulled
as data, and therefore use of a transfer register and a context swap.

Track the information about possible lengths of the value, if it's
guaranteed to be larger than 16bits don't generate the code for the
optimized case at all.
