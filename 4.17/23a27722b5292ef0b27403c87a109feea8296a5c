i2c: dev: prevent ZERO_SIZE_PTR deref in i2cdev_ioctl_rdwr()

i2cdev_ioctl_rdwr() allocates i2c_msg.buf using memdup_user(), which
returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR if i2c_msg.len is zero.

Currently i2cdev_ioctl_rdwr() always dereferences the buf pointer in case
of I2C_M_RD | I2C_M_RECV_LEN transfer. That causes a kernel oops in
case of zero len.

Let's check the len against zero before dereferencing buf pointer.
