rxrpc: Fix Tx ring annotation after initial Tx failure

rxrpc calls have a ring of packets that are awaiting ACK or retransmission
and a parallel ring of annotations that tracks the state of those packets.
If the initial transmission of a packet on the underlying UDP socket fails
then the packet annotation is marked for resend - but the setting of this
mark accidentally erases the last-packet mark also stored in the same
annotation slot.  If this happens, a call won't switch out of the Tx phase
when all the packets have been transmitted.

Fix this by retaining the last-packet mark and only altering the packet
state.
