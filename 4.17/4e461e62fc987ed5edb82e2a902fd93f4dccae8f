ARM: dts: meson8b: the CBUS GPIO controller only has 83 GPIOs

Update the "gpio-ranges" property of the CBUS GPIO controller on Meson8b
because it only provides 83 GPIOs.
The GPIO definitions in include/dt-bindings/gpio/meson8b-gpio.h
inherited all GPIOs from Meson8 until recently. However, Meson8b does
not support all GPIOs which are supported by Meson8 (Meson8b doesn't
have a GPIOZ bank, most of the pins from the GPIODV bank are missing on
Meson8b - just to name a few differences).

The actual number of GPIOs is only 83, instead of 120 from Meson8 plus
the 10 GPIOs from the DIF bank on Meson8b.
