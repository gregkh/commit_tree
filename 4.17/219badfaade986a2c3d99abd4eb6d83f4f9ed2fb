ipv6: frags: get rid of ip6frag_skb_cb/FRAG6_CB

ip6_frag_queue uses skb->cb[] to store the fragment offset, meaning that
we could use two cache lines per skb when finding the insertion point,
if for some reason inet6_skb_parm size is increased in the future.

By using skb->ip_defrag_offset instead of skb->cb[], we pack all
the fields in a single cache line, matching what we did for IPv4.
