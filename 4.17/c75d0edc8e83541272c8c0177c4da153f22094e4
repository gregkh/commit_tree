KVM: VMX: remove bogus WARN_ON in handle_ept_misconfig

Remove the WARN_ON in handle_ept_misconfig() as it is unnecessary
and causes false positives.  Return the unmodified result of
kvm_mmu_page_fault() instead of converting a system error code to
KVM_EXIT_UNKNOWN so that userspace sees the error code of the
actual failure, not a generic "we don't know what went wrong".

  * kvm_mmu_page_fault() will WARN if reserved bits are set in the
    SPTEs, i.e. it covers the case where an EPT misconfig occurred
    because of a KVM bug.

  * The WARN_ON will fire on any system error code that is hit while
    handling the fault, e.g. -ENOMEM from mmu_topup_memory_caches()
    while handling a legitmate MMIO EPT misconfig or -EFAULT from
    kvm_handle_bad_page() if the corresponding HVA is invalid.  In
    either case, userspace should receive the original error code
    and firing a warning is incorrect behavior as KVM is operating
    as designed.
