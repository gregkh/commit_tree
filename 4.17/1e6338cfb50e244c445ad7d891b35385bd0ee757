vsprintf: Do not preprocess non-dereferenced pointers for bprintf (%px and %pK)

Commit 841a915d20c7b2 ("printf: Do not have bprintf dereference pointers")
would preprocess various pointers that are dereferenced in the bprintf()
because the recording and printing are done at two different times. Some
pointers stayed dereferenced in the ring buffer because user space could
handle them (namely "%pS" and friends). Pointers that are not dereferenced
should not be processed immediately but instead just saved directly.
