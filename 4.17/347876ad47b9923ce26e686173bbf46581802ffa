rtc: tx4939: avoid unintended sign extension on a 24 bit shift

The shifting of buf[5] by 24 bits to the left will be promoted to
a 32 bit signed int and then sign-extended to an unsigned long. If
the top bit of buf[5] is set then all then all the upper bits sec
end up as also being set because of the sign-extension. Fix this by
casting buf[5] to an unsigned long before the shift.
