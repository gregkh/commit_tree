clk: rockchip: assign correct id for pclk_ddr and hclk_sd in rk3399

Since hclk_sd and pclk_ddr source clock from CPLL or GPLL,
and these two PLL may change their frequency. If we do not
assign right id to pclk_ddr and hclk_sd, they will alway use
default cur register value, and may get the frequency
exceed their signed off frequency. So assign correct Id
for them, then we can assign frequency for them in dts.
