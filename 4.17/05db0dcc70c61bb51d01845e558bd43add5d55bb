dt-bindings: usb: add the documentation for USB HCDs

A USB HCD may have several PHYs which need to be configured before the
the HCD starts working.
This adds the documentation for such a USB HCD as well as a reference to
the new "usb-hcd.txt" from all bindings that implement a USB HCD which
support one USB PHY per port.
