scsi: libsas: Fix kernel-doc headers

Avoid that building with W=1 causes the kernel-doc tool to complain
about function arguments that have not been documented in the libsas
kernel-doc headers. Avoid that the short description starts with a
hyphen by changing "--" into "-" in the first line of the kernel-doc
headers.
