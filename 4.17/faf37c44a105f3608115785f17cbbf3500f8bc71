powerpc/64s: Clear PCR on boot

Clear the PCR (Processor Compatibility Register) on boot to ensure we
are not running in a compatibility mode.

We've seen this cause problems when a crash (and kdump) occurs while
running compat mode guests. The kdump kernel then runs with the PCR
set and causes problems. The symptom in the kdump kernel (also seen in
petitboot after fast-reboot) is early userspace programs taking
sigills on newer instructions (seen in libc).
