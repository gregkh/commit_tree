perf ui browser: Fixup cleaning unused lines at the bottom

Now that we can have extra title lines we should use ui_browser->rows
and not ->height when drawing lines, as well as adding
ui_browser->extra_title_lines to browser->y when cleaning unused lines
at the bottom, otherwise we end up clobbering with spaces the last line
just shown by ui_browser->refresh() routine.
