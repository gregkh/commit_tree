kvm: use insert sort in kvm_io_bus_register_dev function

The loading time of a VM is quite significant with a CPU usage
reaching 100% when loading a VM that its virtio devices use a
large amount of virt-queues (e.g. a virtio-serial device with
max_ports=511). Most of the time is spend in re-sorting the
kvm_io_bus kvm_io_range array when a new eventfd is registered.

The patch replaces the existing method with an insert sort.
