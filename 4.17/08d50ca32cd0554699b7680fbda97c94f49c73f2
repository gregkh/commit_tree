btrfs: Remove fs_info argument from create_pending_snapshots/create_pending_snapshot

We already pass the trans handle which has a reference to fs_info to
create_pending_snapshot so we can refer to it directly. Doing this
obviates the need to pass the fs_info to create_pending_snapshots as
well. No functional changes.
