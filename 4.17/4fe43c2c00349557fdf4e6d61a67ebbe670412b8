net/wireless/iwlwifi: fix iwlwifi_dev_ucode_error tracepoint

fix iwlwifi_dev_ucode_error tracepoint to pass pointer to a table
instead of all 17 arguments by value.
dvm/main.c and mvm/utils.c have 'struct iwl_error_event_table'
defined with very similar yet subtly different fields and offsets.
tracepoint is still common and using definition of 'struct iwl_error_event_table'
from dvm/commands.h while copying fields.
Long term this tracepoint probably should be split into two.
