drm: NULL pointer dereference [null-pointer-deref] (CWE 476) problem

The Parfait (version 2.1.0) static code analysis tool found the
following NULL pointer dereference problem.

- drivers/gpu/drm/drm_drv.c
Any calls to drm_minor_get_slot() could result in the return of a NULL
pointer when an invalid DRM device type is encountered.  The
return of NULL was removed with BUG() from drm_minor_get_slot().
