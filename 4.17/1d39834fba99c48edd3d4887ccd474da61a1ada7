ext4: remove EXT4_STATE_DIOREAD_LOCK flag

Commit 16c54688592c ("ext4: Allow parallel DIO reads") reworked the way
locking happens around parallel dio reads. This resulted in obviating
the need for EXT4_STATE_DIOREAD_LOCK flag and accompanying logic.
Currently this amounts to dead code so let's remove it. No functional
changes
