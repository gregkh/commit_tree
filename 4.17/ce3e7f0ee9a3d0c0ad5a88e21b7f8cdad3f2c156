pinctrl: ocelot: make function ocelot_pinctrl_probe static

The function ocelot_pinctrl_probe is local to the source and does not
need to be in global scope, so make it static.

Cleans up sparse warning:
drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-ocelot.c:465:5: warning: symbol
'ocelot_pinctrl_probe' was not declared. Should it be static?
