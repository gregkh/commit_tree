ext4: move call to ext4_error() into ext4_xattr_check_block()

Refactor the call to EXT4_ERROR_INODE() into ext4_xattr_check_block().
This simplifies the code, and fixes a problem where not all callers of
ext4_xattr_check_block() were not resulting in ext4_error() getting
called when the xattr block is corrupted.
