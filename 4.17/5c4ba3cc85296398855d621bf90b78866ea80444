firmware: arm_scmi: add option for polling based performance domain operations

In order to implement fast CPU DVFS switching, we need to perform all
DVFS operations atomically. Since SCMI transfer already provide option
to choose between pooling vs interrupt driven(default), we can opt for
polling based transfers for set,get performance domain operations.

This patch adds option to choose between polling vs interrupt driven
SCMI transfers for set,get performance level operations.
