firmware: arm_scmi: add per-protocol channels support using idr objects

In order to maintain the channel information per protocol, we need
some sort of list or hashtable to hold all this information. IDR
provides sparse array mapping of small integer ID numbers onto arbitrary
pointers. In this case the arbitrary pointers can be pointers to the
channel information.

This patch adds support for per-protocol channels using those idr
objects.
