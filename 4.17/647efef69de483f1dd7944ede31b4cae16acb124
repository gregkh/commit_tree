ARM: dts: correct missing "compatible" entry for ti81xx SoCs

The missing "compatible" entries are needed by drivers/clk/ti/clkctrl.c,
and without them the structures initialized in drivers/clk/ti/clk-814x.c
are not passed to configuration code. The result is a "not found from
clkctrl data" error message, although boot proceeds anyway.

The reason why the compatible is not found is because the board specific
files override the SoC compatible without including it. This did not
cause any issues until with the clkctrl nodes got introduced.

Very lightly tested on a (lurching) AM3874 design that's in the middle
of a kernel upgrade from TI's abandoned 2.6.37 tree.

Also tested on j5eco-evm and hp-t410 to verify the clkctrl clocks are
found.
