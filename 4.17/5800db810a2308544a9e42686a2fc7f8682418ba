afs: Init inode before accessing cache

We no longer parse symlinks when we get the inode to determine if this
symlink is actually a mountpoint as we detect that by examining the mode
instead (symlinks are always 0777 and mountpoints 0644).

Access the cache after mapping the status so that we don't have to manually
set the inode size now.

Note that this may need adjusting if the disconnected operation is
implemented as the file metadata may have to be obtained from the cache.
