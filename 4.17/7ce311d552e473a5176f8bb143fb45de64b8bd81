btrfs: use reada direction enum instead of constant value in load_free_space_tree

load_free_space_tree calls either function load_free_space_bitmaps or
load_free_space_extents. And either of those two will lead to call
btrfs_next_item.  So in function load_free_space_tree, use READA_FORWARD
to read forward ahead.

This also changes the value from READA_BACK to READA_FORWARD, since
according to the logic, it should reada_for_search forward, not
backward.
