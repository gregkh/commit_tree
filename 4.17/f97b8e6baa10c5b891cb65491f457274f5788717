media: staging: atomisp: Kill subdev s_parm abuse

Remove sensor driver's interface for setting the use case specific mode
list as well as the mode lists that are related to other than
CI_MODE_PREVIEW. This removes s_parm abuse in using driver specific values
in v4l2_streamparm.capture.capturemode. The drivers already support
[gs]_frame_interval so removing support for [gs]_parm is enough.
