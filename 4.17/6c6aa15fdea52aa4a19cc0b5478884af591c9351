r8169: improve interrupt handling

This patch improves few aspects of interrupt handling:
- update to current interrupt allocation API
  (use pci_alloc_irq_vectors() instead of deprecated pci_enable_msi())
- this implicitly will allocate a MSI-X interrupt if available
- get rid of flag RTL_FEATURE_MSI
- remove some dead code, intentionally disabling (unreliable) MSI
  being partially available on old PCI chips.

The patch works fine on a RTL8168evl (chip version 34) and on a
RTL8169SB (chip version 04).
