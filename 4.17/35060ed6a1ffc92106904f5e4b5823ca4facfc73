x86/kvm/vmx: avoid expensive rdmsr for MSR_GS_BASE

vmx_save_host_state() is only called from kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run() so
the context is pretty well defined and as we're past 'swapgs' MSR_GS_BASE
should contain kernel's GS base which we point to irq_stack_union.

Add new kernelmode_gs_base() API, irq_stack_union needs to be exported
as KVM can be build as module.
