Revert "vfio/type1: Improve memory pinning process for raw PFN mapping"

Bisection by Amadeusz Sławiński implicates this commit leading to bad
page state issues after VM shutdown, likely due to unbalanced page
references.  The original commit was intended only as a performance
improvement, therefore revert for offline rework.
