strparser: Do not call mod_delayed_work with a timeout of LONG_MAX

struct sock's sk_rcvtimeo is initialized to
LONG_MAX/MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT in sock_init_data. Calling
mod_delayed_work with a timeout of LONG_MAX causes spurious execution of
the work function. timer->expires is set equal to jiffies + LONG_MAX.
When timer_base->clk falls behind the current value of jiffies,
the delta between timer_base->clk and jiffies + LONG_MAX causes the
expiration to be in the past. Returning early from strp_start_timer if
timeo == LONG_MAX solves this problem.

Found while testing net/tls_sw recv path.
