The patch does some code cleanup and fixes some small bugs:

- Correct return status of phy_up_v3_hw() and phy_bcast_v3_hw()
- Add static for function phy_get_max_linkrate_v3_hw()
- Change exception return status when no reset method
- Change magic value to ts->stat in slot_complete_vx_hw()
- Remove unnecessary check for dev_is_sata()
- Fix some issues of alignment and indents (Authored by Xiaofei Tan in
  another patch, but added here to be practical)
