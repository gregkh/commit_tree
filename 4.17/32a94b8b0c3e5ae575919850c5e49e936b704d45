kconfig: remove duplicated file name and lineno of recursive inclusion

As in the unit test, the error message for the recursive inclusion
looks like this:

  Kconfig.inc1:4: recursive inclusion detected. Inclusion path:
    current file : 'Kconfig.inc1'
    included from: 'Kconfig.inc3:1'
    included from: 'Kconfig.inc2:3'
    included from: 'Kconfig.inc1:4'

The 'Kconfig.inc1:4' is duplicated in the first and last lines.
Also, the single quotes do not help readability.

Change the message like follows:

  Recursive inclusion detected.
  Inclusion path:
    current file : Kconfig.inc1
    included from: Kconfig.inc3:1
    included from: Kconfig.inc2:3
    included from: Kconfig.inc1:4
