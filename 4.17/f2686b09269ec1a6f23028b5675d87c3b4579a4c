afs: Fix giving up callbacks on server destruction

When a server record is destroyed, we want to send a message to the server
telling it that we're giving up all the callbacks it has promised us.

Apply two fixes to this:

 (1) Only send the FS.GiveUpAllCallBacks message if we actually got a
     callback from that server.  We assume this to be the case if we
     performed at least one successful FS operation on that server.

 (2) Send it to the address last used for that server rather than always
     picking the first address in the list (which might be unreachable).
