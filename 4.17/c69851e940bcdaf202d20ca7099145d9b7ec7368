net: phy: set link state to down when creating the phy_device

Currently the link state is initialized to "up" when the phy_device is
being created. This is not consistent with the phy state being
initialized to PHY_DOWN.

Usually this doen't do any harm because the link state is updated
once the PHY reaches state PHY_AN. However e.g. if a LAN port isn't
used and the PHY remains down this inconsistency remains and calls
to functions like phy_print_status() give false results.
Therefore change the initialization to link being down.
