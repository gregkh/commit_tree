staging: lustre: ptlrpc: use workqueue for pinger

lustre has a "Pinger" kthread which periodically pings peers
to ensure all hosts are functioning.

This can more easily be done using a work queue.

As maintaining contact with other peers is import for
keeping the filesystem running, and as the filesystem might
be involved in freeing memory, it is safest to have a
separate WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue.

The SVC_EVENT functionality to wake up the thread can be
replaced with mod_delayed_work().

Also use round_jiffies_up_relative() rather than setting a
minimum of 1 second delay.  The PING_INTERVAL is measured in
seconds so this meets the need is allow the workqueue to
keep wakeups synchronized.
