net: Convert ipgre_net_ops, ipgre_tap_net_ops, erspan_net_ops, vti_net_ops and ipip_net_ops

These pernet_operations are similar to bond_net_ops. Exit methods
unregisters all net ipgre/ipgre_tap/erspan/vti/ipip devices, and it
looks like another pernet_operations are not interested in foreign
net ipgre/ipgre_tap/erspan/vti/ipip list. Init method also does not
intersect with something pernet-specific. So, it's possible
to mark them async.
