ACPI/IORT: Remove linker section for IORT entries again

In commit 316ca8804ea8 ("ACPI/IORT: Remove linker section for IORT entries
probing"), iort entries was removed in vmlinux.lds.h. But in
commit 2fcc112af37f ("clocksource/drivers: Rename clksrc table to timer"),
this line was back incorrectly.

It does no harm except for adding some useless symbols, so fix it.
