usb: dwc2: add support for host mode external vbus supply

This patch adds a way to enable an external vbus supply in host mode,
when dwc2 drvvbus signal is not used.

This patch is very similar to the one done in U-Boot dwc2 driver [1]. It
also adds dynamic vbus supply management depending on the role and state
of the core.
