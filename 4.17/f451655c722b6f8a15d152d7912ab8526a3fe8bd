power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Fix full status reporting

Commit 2b5a4b4bf222 ("power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Rework
get_status()"), switched from 0A current detection to using the capacity
register for full detection.

It turns out this fixes full reporting on some devices which keep trickle
charging long after the capacity register reach 100%, but breaks it on
some other devices where the charger stops charging before the capacity
register reaches 100%. This commit fixes this by also checking for
0A current when the reported capacity is above 90%.
