IB/mlx4: Fix integer overflow when calculating optimal MTT size

When the kernel was compiled using the UBSAN option,
we saw the following stack trace:

[ 1184.827917] UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/mr.c:349:27
[ 1184.828114] signed integer overflow:
[ 1184.828247] -2147483648 - 1 cannot be represented in type 'int'

The problem was caused by calling round_up in procedure
mlx4_ib_umem_calc_optimal_mtt_size (on line 349, as noted in the stack
trace) with the second parameter (1 << block_shift) (which is an int).
The second parameter should have been (1ULL << block_shift) (which
is an unsigned long long).

(1 << block_shift) is treated by the compiler as an int (because 1 is
an integer).

Now, local variable block_shift is initialized to 31.
If block_shift is 31, 1 << block_shift is 1 << 31 = 0x80000000=-214748368.
This is the most negative int value.

Inside the round_up macro, there is a cast applied to ((1 << 31) - 1).
However, this cast is applied AFTER ((1 << 31) - 1) is calculated.
Since (1 << 31) is treated as an int, we get the negative overflow
identified by UBSAN in the process of calculating ((1 << 31) - 1).

The fix is to change (1 << block_shift) to (1ULL << block_shift) on
line 349.
