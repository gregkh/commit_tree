ip6mr: Remove MFC_NOTIFY and refactor flags

MFC_NOTIFY exists in ip6mr, probably as some legacy code
[was already removed for ipmr in commit
06bd6c0370bb ("net: ipmr: remove unused MFC_NOTIFY flag and make the flags enum").
Remove it from ip6mr as well, and move the enum into a common file;
Notice MFC_OFFLOAD is currently only used by ipmr.
