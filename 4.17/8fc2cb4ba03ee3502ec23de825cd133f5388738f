ocfs2: fix some small problems

First, move setting fe_done = 1 in spin lock, avoid bring any potential
race condition.

Second, tune mlog message level from ERROR to NOTICE, since the message
should not belong to error message.

Third, tune errno to -EAGAIN when file check queue is full, this errno
is more appropriate in the case.
