ceph: optimizing cap reservation

When caps_avail_count is in a low level, most newly
trimmed caps will probably go into ->caps_list and
caps_avail_count will be increased. Hence after trimming,
should recheck caps_avail_count to effectly reuse
newly trimmed caps. Also, when releasing unnecessary
caps follow the same rule of ceph_put_cap.
