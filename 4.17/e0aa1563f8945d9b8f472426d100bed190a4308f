HISI LPC: Add ACPI support

Based on the previous patches, this patch supports the LPC host on
Hip06/Hip07 for ACPI FW.

It is the responsibility of the LPC host driver to enumerate the child
devices, as the ACPI scan code will not enumerate children of "indirect IO"
hosts.

The ACPI table for the LPC host controller and the child devices is in the
following format:

  Device (LPC0) {
    Name (_HID, "HISI0191")  // HiSi LPC
    Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate () {
      Memory32Fixed (ReadWrite, 0xa01b0000, 0x1000)
    })
  }

  Device (LPC0.IPMI) {
    Name (_HID, "IPI0001")
    Name (LORS, ResourceTemplate() {
      QWordIO (
        ResourceConsumer,
        MinNotFixed,     // _MIF
        MaxNotFixed,     // _MAF
        PosDecode,
        EntireRange,
        0x0,             // _GRA
        0xe4,            // _MIN
        0x3fff,          // _MAX
        0x0,             // _TRA
        0x04,            // _LEN
        , ,
        BTIO
      )
    })

Since the IO resources of the child devices need to be translated from LPC
bus addresses to logical PIO addresses, and we shouldn't modify the
resources of the devices generated in the FW scan, a per-child MFD is
created as a substitute.  The MFD IO resources will be the translated bus
addresses of the ACPI child.
