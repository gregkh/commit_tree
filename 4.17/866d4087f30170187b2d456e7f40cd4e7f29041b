phy: rockchip-typec: support DP phy switch

There are 2 Type-c PHYs in RK3399, but only one DP controller. Hence
only one PHY can connect to DP controller at one time, the other should
be disconnected. The GRF_SOC_CON26 register has a switch bit to do it,
set this bit means enable PHY 1, clear this bit means enable PHY 0.
