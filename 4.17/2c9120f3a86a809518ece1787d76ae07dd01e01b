arm64: signal: Make force_signal_inject more robust

force_signal_inject is a little flakey:

  * It only knows about SIGILL and SIGSEGV, so can potentially deliver
    other signals based on a partially initialised siginfo_t

  * It sets si_addr to point at the PC for SIGSEGV

  * It always operates on current, so doesn't need the regs argument

This patch fixes these issues by always assigning the si_addr field to
the address parameter of the function and updates the callers (including
those that indirectly call via arm64_notify_segfault) accordingly.
