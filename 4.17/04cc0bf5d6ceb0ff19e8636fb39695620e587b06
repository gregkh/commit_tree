mlxsw: spectrum: qdiscs: Collect stats for sch_red based on priomap

Priority counters count packets according to their packet priority.
Collect the stats for sch_red based on these counters, so the qdisc bstats
will be the sum of counters matching the priorities marked in the qdisc
priomap.
Changing the mapping of the priorities to bands while traffic is running
can result in losing the stats of the bands qdiscs from their last dump
call to this change, as if the qdisc was unoffloaded and re-offloaded. It
will not affect the traffic behaviour according to sch_red.
