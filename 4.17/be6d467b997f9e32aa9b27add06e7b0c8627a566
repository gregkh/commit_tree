net/smc: remove unused fields from smc structures

The daddr field holds the destination IPv4 address. The field was set but
never used and can be removed. The addr field was a left-over from an
earlier version of non-blocking connects and can be removed.
The result of the call to kernel_getpeername is not used, the call can be
removed. Non-blocking connects are working, so remove restriction comment.
