ALSA: pcm: Fix mutex unbalance in OSS emulation ioctls

The previous fix 40cab6e88cb0 ("ALSA: pcm: Return -EBUSY for OSS
ioctls changing busy streams") introduced some mutex unbalance; the
check of runtime->oss.rw_ref was inserted in a wrong place after the
mutex lock.

This patch fixes the inconsistency by rewriting with the helper
functions to lock/unlock parameters with the stream check.
