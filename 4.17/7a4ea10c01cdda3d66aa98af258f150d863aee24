Revert "ACPI: battery: Add the ThinkPad "Not Charging" quirk"

Revert commit 91eea70e5e5c (ACPI: battery: Add the ThinkPad "Not
Charging" quirk) as it is reported to cause user space to misbehave.

That appears to be due to bugs in user space, so this commit will go
in again after the bugs have been fixed and the fixes have been
delivered to users.
