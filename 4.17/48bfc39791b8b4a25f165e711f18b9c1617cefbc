net/mlx5e: Set EQE based as default TX interrupt moderation mode

The default TX moderation mode was mistakenly set to CQE based. The
intention was to add a control ability in order to improve some specific
use-cases. In general, we prefer to use EQE based moderation as it gives
much better numbers for the common cases.

CQE based causes a degradation in the common case since it resets the
moderation timer on CQE generation. This causes an issue when TSO is
well utilized (large TSO sessions). The timer is set to 16us so traffic
of ~64KB TSO sessions per second would mean timer reset (CQE per TSO
session -> long time between CQEs). In this case we quickly reach the
tcp_limit_output_bytes (256KB by default) and cause a halt in TX traffic.

By setting EQE based moderation we make sure timer would expire after
16us regardless of the packet rate.
This fixes an up to 40% packet rate and up to 23% bandwidth degradtions.
