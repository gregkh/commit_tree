btrfs: Remove btrfs_inode::delayed_iput_count

delayed_iput_count wa supposed to be used to implement, well, delayed
iput. The idea is that we keep accumulating the number of iputs we do
until eventually the inode is deleted. Turns out we never really
switched the delayed_iput_count from 0 to 1, hence all conditional
code relying on the value of that member being different than 0 was
never executed. This, as it turns out, didn't cause any problem due
to the simple fact that the generic inode's i_count member was always
used to count the number of iputs. So let's just remove the unused
member and all unused code. This patch essentially provides no
functional changes. While at it, also add proper documentation for
btrfs_add_delayed_iput
