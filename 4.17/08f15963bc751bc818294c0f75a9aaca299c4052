i2c: qup: use the complete transfer length to choose DMA mode

Currently each message length in complete transfer is being
checked for determining DMA mode and if any of the message length
is less than FIFO length then non DMA mode is being used which
will increase overhead. DMA can be used for any length and it
should be determined with complete transfer length. Now, this
patch selects DMA mode if the total length is greater than FIFO
length.
