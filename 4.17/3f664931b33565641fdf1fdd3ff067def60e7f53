asm-generic: siginfo: remove obsolete #ifdefs

The frv, tile and blackfin architectures are being removed, so
we can clean up this header by removing all the special cases
except those for ia64.

The SEGV_BNDERR and BUS_MCEERR_AR si_code macros are now
defined unconditionally on all remaining architectures.
