ice: Configure VSIs for Tx/Rx

This patch configures the VSIs to be able to send and receive
packets by doing the following:

1) Initialize flexible parser to extract and include certain
   fields in the Rx descriptor.

2) Add Tx queues by programming the Tx queue context (implemented in
   ice_vsi_cfg_txqs). Note that adding the queues also enables (starts)
   the queues.

3) Add Rx queues by programming Rx queue context (implemented in
   ice_vsi_cfg_rxqs). Note that this only adds queues but doesn't start
   them. The rings will be started by calling ice_vsi_start_rx_rings on
   interface up.

4) Configure interrupts for VSI queues.

5) Implement ice_open and ice_stop.
