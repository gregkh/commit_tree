net: add uevent socket member

This commit adds struct uevent_sock to struct net. Since struct uevent_sock
records the position of the uevent socket in the uevent socket list we can
trivially remove it from the uevent socket list during cleanup. This speeds
up the old removal codepath.
Note, list_del() will hit __list_del_entry_valid() in its call chain which
will validate that the element is a member of the list. If it isn't it will
take care that the list is not modified.
