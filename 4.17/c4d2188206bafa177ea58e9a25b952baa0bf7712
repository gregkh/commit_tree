KVM: x86: Update cpuid properly when CR4.OSXAVE or CR4.PKE is changed

The CPUID bits of OSXSAVE (function=0x1) and OSPKE (func=0x7, leaf=0x0)
allows user apps to detect if OS has set CR4.OSXSAVE or CR4.PKE. KVM is
supposed to update these CPUID bits when CR4 is updated. Current KVM
code doesn't handle some special cases when updates come from emulator.
Here is one example:

  Step 1: guest boots
  Step 2: guest OS enables XSAVE ==> CR4.OSXSAVE=1 and CPUID.OSXSAVE=1
  Step 3: guest hot reboot ==> QEMU reset CR4 to 0, but CPUID.OSXAVE==1
  Step 4: guest os checks CPUID.OSXAVE, detects 1, then executes xgetbv

Step 4 above will cause an #UD and guest crash because guest OS hasn't
turned on OSXAVE yet. This patch solves the problem by comparing the the
old_cr4 with cr4. If the related bits have been changed,
kvm_update_cpuid() needs to be called.
