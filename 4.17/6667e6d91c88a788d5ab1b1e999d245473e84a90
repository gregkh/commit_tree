scsi: ufs: add trace event for ufs upiu

Add UFS Protocol Information Units(upiu) trace events for ufs driver,
used to trace various ufs transaction types- command, task-management
and device management.
The trace-point format is generic and can be easily adapted to trace
other upius if needed.
Currently tracing ufs transaction of type 'device management', which
this patch introduce, cannot be obtained from any other trace.
Device management transactions are used for communication with the
device such as reading and writing descriptor or attributes etc.
