usb: dwc2: Delete unused functionality

Deleted dwc2_hcd_dump_frrem() function, because it used undefined
parameters from dwc2_hsotg structure. The function body was in #ifdef
statement and was never compiled.

Also removed that parameters from dwc2_hsotg structure, which were
used only in dwc2_hcd_dump_frrem() function.

And also delete dwc2_sample_frrem macro, because without
dwc2_hcd_dump_frrem() function it's lose its purpose.
