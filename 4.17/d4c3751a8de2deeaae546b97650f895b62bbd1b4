firmware: arm_scmi: add support for polling based SCMI transfers

It would be useful to have options to perform some SCMI transfers
atomically by polling for the completion flag instead of interrupt
driven. The SCMI specification has option to disable the interrupt and
poll for the completion flag in the shared memory.

This patch adds support for polling based SCMI transfers using that
option. This might be used for uninterrupted/atomic DVFS operations
from the scheduler context.
