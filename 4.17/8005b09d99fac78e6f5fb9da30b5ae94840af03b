net: ethernet: davinci_emac: fix error handling in probe()

The current error handling code has an issue where it does:

	if (priv->txchan)
		cpdma_chan_destroy(priv->txchan);

The problem is that ->txchan is either valid or an error pointer (which
would lead to an Oops).  I've changed it to use multiple error labels so
that the test can be removed.

Also there were some missing calls to netif_napi_del().
