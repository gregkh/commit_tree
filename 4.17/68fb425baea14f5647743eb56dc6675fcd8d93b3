ASoC: tlv320aic3x: Use empty struct initializer

{ 0 } only clears the first member of the structure.

The first member of the snd_soc_dapm_update struct is a pointer,
and writing 0 to a pointer results in the following sparse warning:

sound/soc/codecs/tlv320aic3x.c:175:47: warning: Using plain integer as NULL pointer

Use the empty struct initializer that clears all the struct members
and fixes the sparse warning.
