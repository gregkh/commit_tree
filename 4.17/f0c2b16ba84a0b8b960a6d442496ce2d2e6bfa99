drm/amdgpu: no job timeout setting on compute queues

Under some heavy computing environment(e.g. dgemm test), it
takes the asic over 10+ seconds to finish the dispatched job
which will trigger the timeout.

It's quite confusing although it does not seem to bring any
real problems. As a quick workround, we choose to not enfoce
the timeout setting on compute queues.
