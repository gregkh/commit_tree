leaking_addresses: simplify path skipping

Currently script has multiple configuration arrays.  This is confusing,
evident by the fact that a bunch of the entries are in the wrong place.
We can simplify the code by just having a single array for absolute
paths to skip and a single array for file names to skip wherever they
appear in the scanned directory tree.  There are also currently multiple
subroutines to handle the different arrays, we can reduce these to a
single subroutine also.

Simplify the path skipping code.
