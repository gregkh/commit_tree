net: hns3: fix the VF queue reset flow error

VF queue reset flow is different from PF queue reset flow.
VF driver should stop VF queue first, then send message to PF
and PF do the reset. PF should send a response to VF after
PF complete the queue reset, VF can initialize the queue hw
after get the response.
This patch fixes the VF queue reset flow as the correct step.
