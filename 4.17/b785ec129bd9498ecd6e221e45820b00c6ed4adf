riscv/ftrace: Add HAVE_FUNCTION_GRAPH_RET_ADDR_PTR support

In walk_stackframe, the pc now receives the address from calling
ftrace_graph_ret_addr instead of manual calculation.

Note that the original calculation,
        pc = frame->ra - 4
is buggy when the instruction at the return address happened to be a
compressed inst. But since it is not a critical part of ftrace, it is
ignored for now to ease the review process.
