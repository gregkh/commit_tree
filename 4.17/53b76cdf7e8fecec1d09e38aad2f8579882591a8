net: fix deadlock while clearing neighbor proxy table

When coming from ndisc_netdev_event() in net/ipv6/ndisc.c,
neigh_ifdown() is called with &nd_tbl, locking this while
clearing the proxy neighbor entries when eg. deleting an
interface. Calling the table's pndisc_destructor() with the
lock still held, however, can cause a deadlock: When a
multicast listener is available an IGMP packet of type
ICMPV6_MGM_REDUCTION may be sent out. When reaching
ip6_finish_output2(), if no neighbor entry for the target
address is found, __neigh_create() is called with &nd_tbl,
which it'll want to lock.

Move the elements into their own list, then unlock the table
and perform the destruction.
