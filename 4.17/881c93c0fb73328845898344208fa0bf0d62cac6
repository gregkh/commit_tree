fpga-manager: altera-ps-spi: preserve nCONFIG state

If the driver module is loaded when FPGA is configured, the FPGA
is reset because nconfig is pulled low (low-active gpio inited
with GPIOD_OUT_HIGH activates the signal which means setting its
value to low). Init nconfig with GPIOD_OUT_LOW to prevent this.
