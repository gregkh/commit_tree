btrfs: update barrier in should_cow_block

Once there was a simple int force_cow that was used with the plain
barriers, and then converted to a bit, so we should use the appropriate
barrier helper.

Other variables in the complex if condition do not depend on a barrier,
so we should be fine in case the atomic barrier becomes a no-op.
