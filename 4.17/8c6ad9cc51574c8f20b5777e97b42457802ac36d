ieee802154: Add NXP MCR20A IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver driver

The MCR20AVHM transceiver (or MCR20A) is a low power,
high-performance 2.4 GHz, IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceiver.

This driver implements a subset of ieee802154_ops.
It has no support for CSMA due to lack of hardware support.
It has currently no support for its proprietary Dual-PAN feature.
