signal: Add FPE_FLTUNK si_code for undiagnosable fp exceptions

Some architectures cannot always report accurately what kind of
floating-point exception triggered a floating-point exception trap.

This can occur with fp exceptions occurring on lanes in a vector
instruction on arm64 for example.

Rather than have every architecture come up with its own way of
describing such a condition, this patch adds a common FPE_FLTUNK
si_code value to report that an fp exception caused a trap but we
cannot be certain which kind of fp exception it was.
