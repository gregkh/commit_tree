ARM: fix kill( ,SIGFPE) breakage

Commit 7771c6645700 ("signal/arm: Document conflicts with SI_USER and
SIGFPE") broke the siginfo structure for userspace triggered signals,
causing the strace testsuite to regress.  Fix this by eliminating
the FPE_FIXME definition (which is at the root of the breakage) and
use FPE_FLTINV instead for the case where the hardware appears to be
reporting nonsense.
