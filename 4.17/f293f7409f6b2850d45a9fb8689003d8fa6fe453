phy: rockchip-typec: enable usb3 host during usb3 phy power on

We have forced usb3 to work in usb2 only mode in firmware by setting
usb3tousb2_en (bit3 of GRF_USB3PHY0/1_CON0) to 1, and setting
host_u3_port_disable (bit0 of GRF_USB3OTG0/1_CON1) to 1 and host_u3_port
(bit15~12 of GRF_USB3OTG0/1_CON1) to 0. So we need to re-enable usb3
host.

Note that the RK3399 TRM suggests that we should keep the whole usb3
controller in reset for the duration of the Type-C PHY initialization.
However, it's hard to assert the reset in the current framework of
reset. And according to the TRM, it doesn't require that we should
clear the usb3tousb2 bit before pipe ready. So let's enable the usb3
host after pipe ready to avoid the Type-C PHY initialization failure.
