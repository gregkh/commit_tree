net: fib_rules: Add new attribute to set protocol

For ages iproute2 has used `struct rtmsg` as the ancillary header for
FIB rules and in the process set the protocol value to RTPROT_BOOT.
Until ca56209a66 ("net: Allow a rule to track originating protocol")
the kernel rules code ignored the protocol value sent from userspace
and always returned 0 in notifications. To avoid incompatibility with
existing iproute2, send the protocol as a new attribute.

Fixes: cac56209a66 ("net: Allow a rule to track originating protocol")
