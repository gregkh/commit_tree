cpufreq: schedutil: remove stale comment

After commit 794a56ebd9a57 (sched/cpufreq: Change the worker kthread to
SCHED_DEADLINE) schedutil kthreads are "ignored" for a clock frequency
selection point of view, so the potential corner case for RT tasks is not
possible at all now.

Remove the stale comment mentioning it.
