media: rockchip/rga: use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Cast p to dma_addr_t in order to avoid a potential integer overflow.
This variable is being used in a context that expects an expression
of type dma_addr_t (u64).

The expression p << PAGE_SHIFT is currently being evaluated
using 32-bit arithmetic.
