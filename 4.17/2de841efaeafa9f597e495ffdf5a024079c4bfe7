ALSA: usb-audio: Fix forgotten conversion of control query functions

The recent code refactoring made the argument for some helper
functions to be the explicit UAC_CS_* and UAC2_CS_* value instead of
0-based offset.  However, there was one place left forgotten, and it
caused a regression on some devices appearing as the inconsistent
mixer setup.

This patch corrects the forgotten conversion.
