staging: lustre: simplify l_wait_event when intr handler but no timeout.

If l_wait_event() is given a function to be called on a signal,
but no timeout or timeout handler, then the intr function is simply
called at the end if the wait was aborted by a signal.
So a simpler way to write the code (in the one place this case is
used) it to open-code the body of the function after the
wait_event, if -ERESTARTSYS was returned.
