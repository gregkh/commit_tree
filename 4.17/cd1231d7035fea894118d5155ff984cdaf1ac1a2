powerpc/perf: Prevent kernel address leak via perf_get_data_addr()

Sampled Data Address Register (SDAR) is a 64-bit register that
contains the effective address of the storage operand of an
instruction that was being executed, possibly out-of-order, at or
around the time that the Performance Monitor alert occurred.

In certain scenario SDAR happen to contain the kernel address even for
userspace only sampling. Add checks to prevent it.
