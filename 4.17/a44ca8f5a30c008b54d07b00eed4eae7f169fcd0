x86/pti: Reduce amount of kernel text allowed to be Global

commit abb67605203687c8b7943d760638d0301787f8d9

Kees reported to me that I made too much of the kernel image global.
It was far more than just text:

	I think this is too much set global: _end is after data,
	bss, and brk, and all kinds of other stuff that could
	hold secrets. I think this should match what
	mark_rodata_ro() is doing.

This does exactly that.  We use __end_rodata_hpage_align as our
marker both because it is huge-page-aligned and it does not contain
any sections we expect to hold secrets.

Kees's logic was that r/o data is in the kernel image anyway and,
in the case of traditional distributions, can be freely downloaded
from the web, so there's no reason to hide it.
