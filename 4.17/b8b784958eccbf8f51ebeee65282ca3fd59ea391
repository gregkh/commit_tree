bdi: Fix oops in wb_workfn()

Syzbot has reported that it can hit a NULL pointer dereference in
wb_workfn() due to wb->bdi->dev being NULL. This indicates that
wb_workfn() was called for an already unregistered bdi which should not
happen as wb_shutdown() called from bdi_unregister() should make sure
all pending writeback works are completed before bdi is unregistered.
Except that wb_workfn() itself can requeue the work with:

	mod_delayed_work(bdi_wq, &wb->dwork, 0);

and if this happens while wb_shutdown() is waiting in:

	flush_delayed_work(&wb->dwork);

the dwork can get executed after wb_shutdown() has finished and
bdi_unregister() has cleared wb->bdi->dev.

Make wb_workfn() use wakeup_wb() for requeueing the work which takes all
the necessary precautions against racing with bdi unregistration.
