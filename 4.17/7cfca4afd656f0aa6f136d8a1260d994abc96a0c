drm/i915/uc: Introduce intel_uc_suspend|resume

We want to use higher level 'uc' functions as the main entry points to
the GuC/HuC code to hide some details and keep code layered.

While here, move call to disable_guc_interrupts after sending suspend
action to the GuC to allow it work also with CTB as comm mechanism.
