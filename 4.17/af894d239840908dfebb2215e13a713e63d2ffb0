ibmvnic: Fix reset scheduler error handling

In some cases, if the driver is waiting for a reset following
a device parameter change, failure to schedule a reset can result
in a hang since a completion signal is never sent.

If the device configuration is being altered by a tool such
as ethtool or ifconfig, it could cause the console to hang
if the reset request does not get scheduled. Add some additional
error handling code to exit the wait_for_completion if there is
one in progress.
