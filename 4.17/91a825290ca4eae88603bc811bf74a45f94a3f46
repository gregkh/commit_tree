rds: ib: Fix missing call to rds_ib_dev_put in rds_ib_setup_qp

The function rds_ib_setup_qp is calling rds_ib_get_client_data and
should correspondingly call rds_ib_dev_put. This call was lost in
the non-error path with the introduction of error handling done in
commit 3b12f73a5c29 ("rds: ib: add error handle")
