IB/core: Generate GID change event regardless of RoCE GID table property

Due to following reasons, GID table event is generated regardless of GID
table property.

1. GID table cache is maintained at ib core layer regardless of link layer.
2. GID change event has no relation with IB link layer.
3. GID change event also doesn't depend on whether HCA supports GID table
or not.
