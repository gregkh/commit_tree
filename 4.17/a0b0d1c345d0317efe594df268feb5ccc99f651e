fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c: fix potential page fault while unregistering sysctl table

proc_sys_link_fill_cache() does not take currently unregistering sysctl
tables into account, which might result into a page fault in
sysctl_follow_link() - add a check to fix it.

This bug has been present since v3.4.
