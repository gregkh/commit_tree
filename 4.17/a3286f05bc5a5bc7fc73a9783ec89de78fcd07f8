powerpc/mm/slice: create header files dedicated to slices

In preparation for the following patch which will enhance 'slices'
for supporting PPC32 in order to fix an issue on hugepages on 8xx,
this patch takes out of page*.h all bits related to 'slices' and put
them into newly created slice.h header files.
While common parts go into asm/slice.h, subarch specific
parts go into respective books3s/64/slice.c and nohash/64/slice.c
'slices'
