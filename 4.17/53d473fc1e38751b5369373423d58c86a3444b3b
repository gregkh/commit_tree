usb: host: Remove the deprecated ATH79 USB host config options

The options USB_EHCI_ATH79 and USB_OHCI_ATH79 only enable the
generic EHCI and OHCI platform drivers, and have been marked as
deprecated since 2012.

These can be safely removed if we make sure that USB_EHCI_ROOT_HUB_TT
still get enabled for the EHCI driver. This is now done be selecting
this option when the EHCI platform driver is enabled on the ATH79
platform.
