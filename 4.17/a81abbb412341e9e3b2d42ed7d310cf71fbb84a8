watchdog: dw: RMW the control register

RK3399 has rst_pulse_length in CONTROL_REG[4:2], determining the length
of pulse to issue for system reset. We shouldn't clobber this value,
because that might make the system reset ineffective. On RK3399, we're
seeing that a value of 000b (meaning 2 cycles) yields an unreliable
(partial?) reset, and so we only fully reset after the watchdog fires a
second time. If we retain the system default (010b, or 8 clock cycles),
then the watchdog reset is much more reliable.

Read-modify-write retains the system value and improves reset
reliability.

It seems we were intentionally clobbering the response mode previously,
to ensure we performed a system reset (we don't support an interrupt
notification), so retain that explicitly.
