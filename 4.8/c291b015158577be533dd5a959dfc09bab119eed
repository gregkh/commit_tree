x86/apic: Fix num_processors value in case of failure

If the topology package map check of the APIC ID and the CPU is a failure,
we don't generate the processor info for that APIC ID yet we increase
disabled_cpus by one - which is buggy.

Only increase num_processors once we are sure we don't fail.
