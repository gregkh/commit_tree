staging: comedi: daqboard2000: bug fix board type matching code

`daqboard2000_find_boardinfo()` is supposed to check if the
DaqBoard/2000 series model is supported, based on the PCI subvendor and
subdevice ID.  The current code is wrong as it is comparing the PCI
device's subdevice ID to an expected, fixed value for the subvendor ID.
It should be comparing the PCI device's subvendor ID to this fixed
value.  Correct it.

subsystem_device check")
