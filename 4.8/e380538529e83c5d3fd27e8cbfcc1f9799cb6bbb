power_supply: fix return value of get_property

power_supply_get_property() should ideally return -EAGAIN if it is
called while the power_supply is being registered. There was no way
previously to determine if use_cnt == 0 meant that the power_supply
wasn't fully registered yet, or if it had already been unregistered.

Add a new boolean to the power_supply struct to simply show if
registration is completed. Lastly, modify the check in
power_supply_show_property() to also ignore -EAGAIN when so it
doesn't complain about not returning the property.
