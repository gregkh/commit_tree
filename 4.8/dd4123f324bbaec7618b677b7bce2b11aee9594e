It was caused by non-lru page migration which needs compaction.h but
compaction.h doesn't include any header to be standalone.

I think proper header for non-lru page migration is migrate.h rather
than compaction.h because migrate.h has already headers needed to work
non-lru page migration indirectly like isolate_mode_t, migrate_mode
MIGRATEPAGE_SUCCESS.
