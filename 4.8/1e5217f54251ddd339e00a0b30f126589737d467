MIPS: KVM: Dynamically choose scratch registers

Scratch cop0 registers are needed by KVM to be able to save/restore all
the GPRs, including k0/k1, and for storing the VCPU pointer. However no
registers are universally suitable for these purposes, so the decision
should be made at runtime.

Until now, we've used DDATA_LO to store the VCPU pointer, and ErrorEPC
as a temporary. It could be argued that this is abuse of those
registers, and DDATA_LO is known not to be usable on certain
implementations (Cavium Octeon). If KScratch registers are present, use
them instead.

We save & restore the temporary register in addition to the VCPU pointer
register when using a KScratch register for it, as it may be used for
normal host TLB handling too.
