dm raid: support raid0 with missing metadata devices

The raid0 MD personality does not start a raid0 array with any of its
data devices missing.

dm-raid was removing data/metadata device pairs unconditionally if it
failed to read a superblock off the respective metadata device of such
pair, resulting in failure to start arrays with the raid0 personality.

Avoid removing any data/metadata device pairs in case of raid0
(e.g. lvm2 segment type 'raid0_meta') thus allowing MD to start the
array.

Also, avoid region size validation for raid0.
