mm: hwpoison: remove incorrect comments

dequeue_hwpoisoned_huge_page() can be called without page lock hold, so
let's remove incorrect comment.

The reason why the page lock is not really needed is that
dequeue_hwpoisoned_huge_page() checks page_huge_active() inside
hugetlb_lock, which allows us to avoid trying to dequeue a hugepage that
are just allocated but not linked to active list yet, even without
taking page lock.
