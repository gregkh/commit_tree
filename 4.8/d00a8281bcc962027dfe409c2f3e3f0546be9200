net: ethernet: bgmac: change bgmac_* prints to dev_* prints

The bgmac_* print wrappers call dev_* prints with the dev pointer from
the bcma core.  In anticipation of removing the bcma requirement for
this driver, these must be changed to not reference that struct.  So,
simply change all of the bgmac_* prints to their dev_* counterparts.  In
some cases netdev_* prints are more appropriate, so change those as
well.
