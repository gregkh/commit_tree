x86/apic/x2apic, smp/hotplug: Don't use before alloc in x2apic_cluster_probe()

I made a mistake while converting the driver to the hotplug state
machine and as a result x2apic_cluster_probe() was accessing
cpus_in_cluster before allocating it.

This patch fixes it by setting the cpumask after the allocation the
memory succeeded.

While at it, I marked two functions static which are only used within
this file.
