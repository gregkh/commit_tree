iio: light: gp2ap020a00f: use iio helper function to lock direct mode

Replace the code that guarantees the device stays in direct mode
with iio_device_claim_direct_mode() which does same.  Includes a
tiny bit of refactoring (single case -> if) and simplified return
flow.

Also prevents a theoretical race condition by effectively taking the lock
a little earlier than before.
