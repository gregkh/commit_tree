KVM: s390: Add sthyi emulation

Store Hypervisor Information is an emulated z/VM instruction that
provides a guest with basic information about the layers it is running
on. This includes information about the cpu configuration of both the
machine and the lpar, as well as their names, machine model and
machine type. This information enables an application to determine the
maximum capacity of CPs and IFLs available to software.

The instruction is available whenever the facility bit 74 is set,
otherwise executing it results in an operation exception.

It is important to check the validity flags in the sections before
using data from any structure member. It is not guaranteed that all
members will be valid on all machines / machine configurations.
