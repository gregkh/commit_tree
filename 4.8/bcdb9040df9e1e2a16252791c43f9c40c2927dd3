[media] DocBook: mention the memory type to be set for all streaming I/O

The DMA buffer importing streaming I/O section mentions the memory type
value that has to be set when calling the VIDIOC_REQBUFS ioctl but this
isn't mentioned in neither the Memory Mapping nor User Pointer sections.

A user can know the values by looking at the examples but it's better
to explicitly mention in the documentation, and also makes all sections
about streaming I/O methods more consistent.
