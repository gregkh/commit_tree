kvm: x86: correctly reset dest_map->vector when restoring LAPIC state

When userspace sends KVM_SET_LAPIC, KVM schedules a check between
the vCPU's IRR and ISR and the IOAPIC redirection table, in order
to re-establish the IOAPIC's dest_map (the list of CPUs servicing
the real-time clock interrupt with the corresponding vectors).

However, __rtc_irq_eoi_tracking_restore_one was forgetting to
set dest_map->vectors.  Because of this, the IOAPIC did not process
the real-time clock interrupt EOI, ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi
got stuck at a non-zero value, and further RTC interrupts were
reported to userspace as coalesced.
