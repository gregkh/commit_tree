x86/mm: Remove kernel_unmap_pages_in_pgd() and efi_cleanup_page_tables()

kernel_unmap_pages_in_pgd() is dangerous: if a PGD entry in
init_mm.pgd were to be cleared, callers would need to ensure that
the pgd entry hadn't been propagated to any other pgd.

Its only caller was efi_cleanup_page_tables(), and that, in turn,
was unused, so just delete both functions.  This leaves a couple of
other helpers unused, so delete them, too.
