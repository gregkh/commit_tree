ALSA: compress: Add function to indicate the stream has gone bad

Currently, the avail IOCTL doesn't pass any error status, which
means typically on error it simply shows no data available. This
can lead to situations where user-space is waiting indefinitely
for data that will never come as the DSP has suffered an
unrecoverable error.

Add snd_compr_stop_error which end drivers can call to indicate
the stream has suffered an unrecoverable error and stop it. The
avail and poll IOCTLs are then updated to report if the stream is
in an error state to user-space. Allowing the error to propagate
out. Processing of the actual snd_compr_stop needs to be deferred
to a worker thread as the end driver may detect the errors during
an existing operation callback.
