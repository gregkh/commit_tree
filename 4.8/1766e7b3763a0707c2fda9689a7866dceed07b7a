mfd: da8xx-cfgchip: New header file for CFGCHIP registers

Create a new header file for TI DA8XX SoC CFGCHIPx registers.
This will be used by a number of planned drivers including a new USB
PHY driver and common clock framework drivers.

The same defines *will* be removed from the platform_data header,
once all the users start using the new syscon device header.

This also fixes the following compiler error caused due to
a dependent patch not merged.
drivers/phy/phy-da8xx-usb.c:19:37:
fatal error: linux/mfd/da8xx-cfgchip.h: No such file or directory
 #include <linux/mfd/da8xx-cfgchip.h>
