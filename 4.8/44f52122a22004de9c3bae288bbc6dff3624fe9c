GFS2: Check rs_free with rd_rsspin protection

For the last process to close a file opened for write, function
gfs2_rsqa_delete was deleting the file's inode's block reservation
out of the rgrp reservations tree. Then it was checking to make sure
rs_free was 0, but it was performing the check outside the protection
of rd_rsspin spin_lock. The rd_rsspin spin_lock protection is needed
to prevent a race between the process freeing the reservation and
another who is allocating a new set of blocks inside the same rgrp
for the same inode, thus changing its value.
