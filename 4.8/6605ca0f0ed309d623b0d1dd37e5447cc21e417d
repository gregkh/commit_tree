drm/crtc-helper: disable_unused_functions really isn't for atomic

Rockchip just blew up here on testing, because I removed some "is this
crtc already disabled/enabled" state tracking from callbacks (not needed
with atomic). Turns out that was needed to work around rockchip still
calling legacy helper code.

Since me explaining on irc/mailing-list plus kerneldoc isn't enough,
be more verbose and add dmesg output. Not that anyone actually reads that,
either.
