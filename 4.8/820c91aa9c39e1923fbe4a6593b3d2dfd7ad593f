fm10k: use common reset flow when handling io errors from PCI stack

Now that we have extracted the necessary steps for a split
suspend/resume flow, re-use these functions instead of using the current
open coded flow. This ensures that we don't miss any steps. It also
ensures that we have the correct driver states set.

Since we'll be handling all of the reset flow ourselves, we no longer
need to request a reset in the io_slot_reset() function.
