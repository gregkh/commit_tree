powerpc/mm: Move disable_radix handling into mmu_early_init_devtree()

Move the handling of the disable_radix command line argument into the
newly created mmu_early_init_devtree().

It's an MMU option so it's preferable to have it in an mm related file,
and it also means platforms that don't support radix don't have to carry
the code.
