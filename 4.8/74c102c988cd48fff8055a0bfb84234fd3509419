arm64: efi: avoid block mappings for unaligned UEFI memory regions

When running the OS with a page size > 4 KB, we need to round up mappings
for regions that are not aligned to the OS's page size. We already avoid
block mappings for EfiRuntimeServicesCode/Data regions for other reasons,
but in the unlikely event that other unaliged regions exists that have the
EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute set, ensure that unaligned regions are always
mapped down to pages. This way, the overlapping page is guaranteed not to
be covered by a block mapping that needs to be split.
