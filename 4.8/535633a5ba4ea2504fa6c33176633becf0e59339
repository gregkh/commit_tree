wlcore: reconfigure sta rates on authorization

Since stations can now be added before association
(NL80211_FEATURE_FULL_AP_CLIENT_STATE support),
no supported rates are set when the station is added
to the fw, resulting in fw recovery.

Fix it by first configuring the AP basic rates as
the station configured rates (when the station is
first added to the driver), and after the station
was authorized re-configure it, now with the actual
supported rates.
