ARM: AM335x/AM437x: hwmod: Remove eQEP, ePWM and eCAP hwmod entries

Devices that utilize the OCP registers and/or PRCM registers and
register bit fields should be modeled using hwmod. Since eQEP, ePWM and
eCAP don't fall under this category, remove their hwmod entries.

Instead these clocks simply use the clock that is passed through by its
parent PWMSS. Therefore, PWMSS handles the clock for itself and its
subdevices.
