sctp: fix panic when sending auth chunks

When we introduced GSO support, if using auth the auth chunk was being
left queued on the packet even after the final segment was generated.
Later on sctp_transmit_packet it calls sctp_packet_reset, which zeroed
the packet len while not accounting for this left-over. This caused more
space to be used the next packet due to the chunk still being queued,
but space which wasn't allocated as its size wasn't accounted.

The fix is to only queue it back when we know that we are going to
generate another segment.
