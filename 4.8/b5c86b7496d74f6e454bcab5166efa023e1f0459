ARM: tegra: fix erroneous address in dts

c90bb7b enabled the high speed UARTs of the Jetson TK1. Due to a merge
quirk, wrong addresses were introduced. Fix it and use the correct
addresses.

Thierry let me know, that there is another patch (b5896f67ab3c in
linux-next) in preparation which removes all the '0,' prefixes of unit
addresses on Tegra124 and is planned to go upstream in 4.8, so
this patch will get reverted then.

But for the moment, this patch is necessary to fix current misbehaviour.
