usb: gadget: prevent potenial null pointer dereference on skb->len

An earlier fix partially fixed the null pointer dereference on skb->len
by moving the assignment of len after the check on skb being non-null,
however it failed to remove the erroneous dereference when assigning len.
Correctly fix this by removing the initialisation of len as was
originally intended.
