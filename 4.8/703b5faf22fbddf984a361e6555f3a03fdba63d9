fs/dcache.c: Save one 32-bit multiply in dcache lookup

Noe that we're mixing in the parent pointer earlier, we
don't need to use hash_32() to mix its bits.  Instead, we can
just take the msbits of the hash value directly.

For those applications which use the partial_name_hash(),
move the multiply to end_name_hash.
