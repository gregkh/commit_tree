dmaengine: xilinx-vdma: add some sanity checks

The newly added xilinx_dma_prep_dma_cyclic function sometimes causes
a gcc warning about the use of the segment function in case
we never run into the inner loop of the function:

dma/xilinx/xilinx_vdma.c: In function 'xilinx_dma_prep_dma_cyclic':
dma/xilinx/xilinx_vdma.c:1808:23: error: 'segment' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
   segment->hw.control |= XILINX_DMA_BD_SOP;

This can only happen if the period len is zero (which would cause other
problems earlier), or if the buffer is shorter than a period. Neither
of them should ever happen, but by adding an explicit check for these two
cases, we can abort in a more controlled way, and the compiler is
able to see that we never use uninitialized data.
