drm/i915: Use a hybrid scheme for fast register waits

Ville Syrj채l채 reported that in the majority of wait_for(I915_READ()) he
inspect, most completed within the first couple of reads and that the
delay between those wait_for() reads was the ratelimiting step for many
code paths. For example, __gen6_update_ring_freq() was blamed for
slowing down boot by many milliseconds, but under Ville's scrutiny the
issue was just excessive delay waiting for sandybridge_pcode_write().

We can eliminate the wait by initially using a busyspin upon the register
read and only fallback to the sleeping loop in cases where the hardware
is indeed too slow. A threshold of 2 microseconds is used as the initial
ballpark.

To avoid excessive code bloating from converting every wait_for() into a
hybrid busy/sleep loop, we extend wait_for_register_fw() and export it
for use by other callers.
