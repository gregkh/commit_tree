drm/i915/vlv: Disable HPD in valleyview_crt_detect_hotplug()

One of the things preventing us from using polling is the fact that
calling valleyview_crt_detect_hotplug() when there's a VGA cable
connected results in sending another hotplug. With polling enabled when
HPD is disabled, this results in a scenario like this:

- We enable power wells and reset the ADPA
- output_poll_exec does force probe on VGA, triggering a hpd
- HPD handler waits for poll to unlock dev->mode_config.mutex
- output_poll_exec shuts off the ADPA, unlocks dev->mode_config.mutex
- HPD handler runs, resets ADPA and brings us back to the start

This results in an endless irq storm getting sent from the ADPA
whenever a VGA connector gets detected in the middle of polling.

Somewhat based off of the "drm/i915: Disable CRT HPD around force
trigger" patch Ville Syrj채l채 sent a while back
