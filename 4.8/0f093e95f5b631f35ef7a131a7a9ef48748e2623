ACPI / dock: make dock explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this file is:

drivers/acpi/Kconfig:config ACPI_DOCK
drivers/acpi/Kconfig:   bool "Dock"

...and so it is not built as a module.  Hence including module.h
and everything that comes with it just for the no-op MODULE_LICENSE
and friends is rather heavy handed.

The license/author info is found at the top of the file, so we
just remove the MODULE_LICENSE etc and the include of module.h

The file does still have some module_param() so we add the right
include for that infrastructure.
