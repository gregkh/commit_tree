intel_pstate: Update cpu_frequency tracepoint every time

Currently, intel_pstate only updates the cpu_frequency tracepoint
if the new P-state to set is different from the current one, but
that causes powertop to report 100% idle on an 100% loaded system
sometimes.

Prevent that from happening by updating the cpu_frequency tracepoint
every time intel_pstate_update_pstate() is called.
