xen-netback: fix error handling on netback_probe()

In case of error during netback_probe() (e.g. an entry missing on the
xenstore) netback_remove() is called on the new device, which will set
the device backend state to XenbusStateClosed by calling
set_backend_state(). However, the backend state wasn't initialized by
netback_probe() at this point, which will cause and invalid transaction
and set_backend_state() to BUG().

Initialize the backend state at the beginning of netback_probe() to
XenbusStateInitialising, and create two new valid state transitions on
set_backend_state(), from XenbusStateInitialising to XenbusStateClosed,
and from XenbusStateInitialising to XenbusStateInitWait.
