watchdog: Implement status function in watchdog core

Up to now, the watchdog status function called a driver function,
which was supposed to return the watchdog status. All but one
driver using the watchdog core did not implement this function,
and the driver implementing it did not implement it correctly
(the function is supposed to return WDIOF_ flags). At the same time,
at least some of the status information can be provided by the watchdog
core.

Provide the available status bits directly from the watchdog driver core.
Call the driver status function if it exists to get the boot status, but
always provide WDIOF_MAGICCLOSE and WDIOF_KEEPALIVEPING internally.
This patch makes the 'status' sysfs attribute always available.
This attribute is now displayed as hex number with 0x prepended to be
easier to decode.
