KVM: s390: vsie: speed up VCPU external calls

Whenever a SIGP external call is injected via the SIGP external call
interpretation facility, the VCPU is not kicked. When a VCPU is currently
in the VSIE, the external call might not be processed immediately.

Therefore we have to provoke partial execution exceptions, which leads to a
kick of the VCPU and therefore also kick out of VSIE. This is done by
simulating the WAIT state. This bit has no other side effects.
