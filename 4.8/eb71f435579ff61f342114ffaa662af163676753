nvme: Modify and export sync command submission for fabrics

NVMe over fabrics will use __nvme_submit_sync_cmd in the the
transport and require a few tweaks to it.  For that we export it
and add a few more paramters:

1. allow passing a queue ID to the block layer

   For the NVMe over Fabrics connect command we need to able to specify a
   queue ID that we want to send the command on.  Add a qid parameter to
   the relevant functions to enable this behavior.

2. allow submitting at_head commands

   In cases where we want to (re)connect to a controller
   where we have inflight queued commands we want to first
   connect and only then allow the other queued commands to
   be kicked. This will prevents failures in controller resets
   and reconnects.

3. allow passing flags to blk_mq_allocate_request

   Both for Fabrics connect the the keep-alive feature in NVMe 1.2.1 we
   want to be able to use reserved requests.
