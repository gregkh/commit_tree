drm/i915: Apply strongly ordered RCS breadcrumb to gen8/legacy

For legacy ringbuffer mode, we need the new ordered breadcrumb emission
tried and tested on execlists in order to avoid the dreaded "missed
interrupt" syndrome. A secondary advantage of the execlists method is
that it writes to an arbitrary address, useful if one wants to write a
breadcrumb elsewhere.

This fix is taken from commit 7c17d377374dd (drm/i915: Use ordered seqno
write interrupt generation on gen8+ execlists).
