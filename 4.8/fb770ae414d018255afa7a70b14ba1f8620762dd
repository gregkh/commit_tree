Btrfs: fix read_node_slot to return errors

We use read_node_slot() to read btree node and it has two cases,
a) slot is out of range, which means 'no such entry'
b) we fail to read the block, due to checksum fails or corrupted
   content or not with uptodate flag.
But we're returning NULL in both cases, this makes it return -ENOENT
in case a) and return -EIO in case b), and this fixes its callers
as well as btrfs_search_forward() 's caller to catch the new errors.

The problem is reported by Peter Becker, and I can manage to
hit the same BUG_ON by mounting my fuzz image.
