qla2xxx: setup data needed in ISR before setting up the ISR

qla2xxx first calls request_irq() and then does the setup of the queue
entry data needed in the interrupt handlers in when using MSI-X. This
could lead to a NULL pointer dereference when an IRQ fires between the
request_irq() call and the assignment of the qentry data structure to
the rsp->msix field. A possible case for such a race would be in the
kdump case when the HBA's IRQs are still enabled but the driver is
undergoing a new initialisation and thus is not aware of already
activated IRQs in the HBA.
