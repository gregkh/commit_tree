tools/gpio: add the gpio-hammer tool

The gpio-hammer is used from userspace as an example of how
to retrieve a GPIO handle for one or several GPIO lines and
hammer the outputs from low to high and back again. It will
pulse the selected lines once per second for a specified
number of times or indefinitely if no loop count is
supplied.

Example output:
$ gpio-hammer -n gpiochip0 -o5 -o6 -o7
Hammer lines [5, 6, 7] on gpiochip0, initial states: [1, 1, 1]
[-] [5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0]
