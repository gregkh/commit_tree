ovl: dilute permission checks on lower only if not special file

Right now if file is on lower/, we remove MAY_WRITE/MAY_APPEND bits from
mask as lower/ will never be written and file will be copied up. But this
is not true for special files. These files are not copied up and are opened
in place. So don't dilute the checks for these types of files.
