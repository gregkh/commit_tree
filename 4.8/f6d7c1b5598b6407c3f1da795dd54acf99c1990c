mtd: nand: davinci: Reinitialize the HW ECC engine in 4bit hwctl

This fixes subpage writes when using 4-bit HW ECC.

There has been numerous reports about ECC errors with devices using this
driver for a while.  Also the 4-bit ECC has been reported as broken with
subpages in [1] and with 16 bits NANDs in the driver and in mach* board
files both in mainline and in the vendor BSPs.

What I saw with 4-bit ECC on a 16bits NAND (on an LCDK) which got me to
try reinitializing the ECC engine:
- R/W on whole pages properly generates/checks RS code
- try writing the 1st subpage only of a blank page, the subpage is well
  written and the RS code properly generated, re-reading the same page
  the HW detects some ECC error, reading the same page again no ECC
  error is detected

Note that the ECC engine is already reinitialized in the 1-bit case.

Tested on my LCDK with UBI+UBIFS using subpages.
This could potentially get rid of the issue workarounded in [1].
