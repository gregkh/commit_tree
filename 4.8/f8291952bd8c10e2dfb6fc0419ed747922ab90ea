drm/i915: Stop mapping the scratch page into CPU space

After the elimination of using the scratch page for Ironlake's
breadcrumb, we no longer need to kmap the object. We therefore can move
it into the high unmappable space and do not need to force the object to
be coherent (i.e. snooped on !llc platforms).
