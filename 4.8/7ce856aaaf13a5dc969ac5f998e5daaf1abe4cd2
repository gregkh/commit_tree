mlxsw: spectrum: Add couple of lower device helper functions

Add functions that iterate over lower devices and find port device.
As a dependency add netdev_for_each_all_lower_dev and
netdev_for_each_all_lower_dev_rcu macro with
netdev_all_lower_get_next and netdev_all_lower_get_next_rcu shelpers.

Also, add functions to return mlxsw struct according to lower device
found and mlxsw_port struct with a reference to lower device.
