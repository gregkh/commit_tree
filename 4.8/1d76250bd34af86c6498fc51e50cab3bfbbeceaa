nl80211: support beacon report scanning

Beacon report radio measurement requires reporting observed BSSs
on the channels specified in the beacon request. If the measurement
mode is set to passive or active, it requires actually performing a
scan (passive or active, accordingly), and reporting the time that
the scan was started and the time each beacon/probe was received
(both in terms of TSF of the BSS of the requesting AP). If the
request mode is table, this information is optional.
In addition, the radio measurement request specifies the channel
dwell time for the measurement.

In order to use scan for beacon report when the mode is active or
passive, add a parameter to scan request that specifies the
channel dwell time, and add scan start time and beacon received time
to scan results information.

Supporting beacon report is required for Multi Band Operation (MBO).
