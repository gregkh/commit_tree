sctp: only check for ECN if peer is using it

Currently only read-only checks are performed up to the point on where
we check if peer is ECN capable, checks which we can avoid otherwise.
The flag ecn_ce_done is only used to perform this check once per
incoming packet, and nothing more.

Thus this patch moves the peer check up.
