powerpc: Move cpu_has_feature() to a separate file

We plan to use jump label for cpu_has_feature(). In order to implement
this we need to include the linux/jump_label.h in asm/cputable.h.

Unfortunately if we do that it leads to an include loop. The root of the
problem seems to be that reg.h needs cputable.h (for CPU_FTRs), and then
cputable.h via jump_label.h eventually pulls in hw_irq.h which needs
reg.h (for MSR_EE).

So move cpu_has_feature() to a separate file on its own.
