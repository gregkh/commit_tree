eeprom: at24: tweak the loop_until_timeout() macro

loop_until_timeout() replaced a do {} while loop in the at24 driver
with a for loop which, under certain circumstances (such as heavy load
or low value of the write_timeout argument), can lead to the code in
the loop never being executed.

Make sure that at least one iteration of the code enclosed within
loop_until_timeout() is always executed.
