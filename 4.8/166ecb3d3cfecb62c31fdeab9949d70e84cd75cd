KVM: s390: vsie: support transactional execution

As soon as guest 2 is allowed to use transactional execution (indicated via
STFLE), he can also enable it for guest 3.

Active transactional execution requires also the second prefix page to be
mapped. If that page cannot be mapped, a validity icpt has to be presented
to the guest.

We have to take care of tx being toggled on/off, otherwise we might get
wrong prefix validity icpt.
