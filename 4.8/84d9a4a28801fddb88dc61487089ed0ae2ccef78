drm/arc: Actually bother with handling atomic events.

The drm core has a nice ready-made helper for exactly the simple case
where it should fire on the next vblank.

Note that arming the vblank event in _begin is probably too early, and
might easily result in the vblank firing too early, before the new set
of planes are actually disabled. But that's kinda a minor issue
compared to just outright hanging userspace.

v2: Be more robust and either arm, when the CRTC is on, or just send
the event out right away.

v3: Just unconditionally send out the event directly, for safety -
arcpgu doesn't even have vblank support ...
