MIPS: hpet: Increase HPET_MIN_PROG_DELTA and decrease HPET_MIN_CYCLES

At first, we prefer to use mips clockevent device, so we decrease the
rating of hpet clockevent device.

For hpet, if HPET_MIN_PROG_DELTA (minimum delta of hpet programming) is
too small and HPET_MIN_CYCLES (threshold of -ETIME checking) is too
large, then hpet_next_event() can easily return -ETIME. After commit
c6eb3f70d44828 ("hrtimer: Get rid of hrtimer softirq") this will cause
a RCU stall.

So, HPET_MIN_PROG_DELTA must be sufficient that we don't re-trip the
-ETIME check -- if we do, we will return -ETIME, forward the next event
time, try to set it, return -ETIME again, and basically lock the system
up. Meanwhile, HPET_MIN_CYCLES doesn't need to be too large, 16 cycles
is enough.

This solution is similar to commit f9eccf24615672 ("clocksource/drivers
/vt8500: Increase the minimum delta").

By the way, this patch ensures hpet count/compare to be 32-bit long.
