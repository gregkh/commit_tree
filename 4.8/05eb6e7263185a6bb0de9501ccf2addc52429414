radix-tree: account nodes to memcg only if explicitly requested

Radix trees may be used not only for storing page cache pages, so
unconditionally accounting radix tree nodes to the current memory cgroup
is bad: if a radix tree node is used for storing data shared among
different cgroups we risk pinning dead memory cgroups forever.

So let's only account radix tree nodes if it was explicitly requested by
passing __GFP_ACCOUNT to INIT_RADIX_TREE.  Currently, we only want to
account page cache entries, so mark mapping->page_tree so.
