ARM: dts: imx6q: extend support for the cm-fx6

The cm-fx6 module has an on-board spi-flash chip for its firmware, an
eeprom (containing e.g. the mac address of the on-board Ethernet),
a sata port, a pcie controller, an USB hub, and an USB otg port.
Enable support for them. In addition, enable syscon poweroff support.
