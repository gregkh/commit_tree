x86/fpu: Add tracepoints to dump FPU state at key points

I've been carrying this patch around for a bit and it's helped me
solve at least a couple FPU-related bugs.  In addition to using
it for debugging, I also drug it out because using AVX (and
AVX2/AVX-512) can have serious power consequences for a modern
core.  It's very important to be able to figure out who is using
it.

It's also insanely useful to go out and see who is using a given
feature, like MPX or Memory Protection Keys.  If you, for
instance, want to find all processes using protection keys, you
can do:

	echo 'xfeatures & 0x200' > filter

Since 0x200 is the protection keys feature bit.

Note that this touches the KVM code.  KVM did a CREATE_TRACE_POINTS
and then included a bunch of random headers.  If anyone one of
those included other tracepoints, it would have defined the *OTHER*
tracepoints.  That's bogus, so move it to the right place.
