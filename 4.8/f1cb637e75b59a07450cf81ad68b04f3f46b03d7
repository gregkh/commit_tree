init/Kconfig: add clarification for out-of-tree modules

It doesn't trim just symbols that are totally unused in-tree - it trims
the symbols unused by any in-tree modules actually built.  If you've
done a 'make localmodconfig' and only build a hundred or so modules,
it's pretty likely that your out-of-tree module will come up lacking
something...

Hopefully this will save the next guy from a Homer Simpson "D'oh!"
moment.
