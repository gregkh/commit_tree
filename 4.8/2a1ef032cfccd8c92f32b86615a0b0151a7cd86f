perf tools: Fix rm_rf() to handle non-regular files correctly

Fix rm_rf() to handle non-regular files correctly. This fix includes two
changes;

 - Fix to use lstat(3) instead of stat(3) since if the target
   file is a symbolic link, rm_rf() should unlink the symbolic
   link itself, not the file which pointed by the symlink.
 - Fix to unlink non-regular files (except for directory),
   including symlink.

Even though the first one fixes to stat symlink itself, without second
fix, it still failed because the symlink is not a regular file.
