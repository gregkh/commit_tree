ASoC: dwc: Add PIO PCM extension

A PCM extension was added to I2S driver so that audio
samples are transferred using PIO mode.

The PCM supports two channels @ 16 or 32 bits with rates
32k, 44.1k and 48k.

Although the mainline I2S driver uses ALSA DMA engine the
I2S controller can be built without DMA support, therefore
this is the reason why this extension was added.
