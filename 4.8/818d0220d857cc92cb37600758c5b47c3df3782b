eeprom: at24: support reading the serial number for 24csxx

The chips from the at24cs family have two memory areas - a regular
read-write block and a read-only area containing the serial number.

The latter is visible on a different slave address (the address of the
rw memory block + 0x08). In order to access both blocks the user needs
to instantiate a regular at24c device for the rw block address and a
corresponding at24cs device on the serial number block address.

Add a function that allows to access the serial number and assign it
to at24->read_func if the chip allows serial number read operations
and the driver was passed the relevant flag for this device.
