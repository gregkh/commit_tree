char/genrtc: x86: remove remnants of asm/rtc.h

Commit 3195ef59cb42 ("x86: Do full rtc synchronization with ntp") had
the side-effect of unconditionally enabling the RTC_LIB symbol on x86,
which in turn disables the selection of the CONFIG_RTC and
CONFIG_GEN_RTC drivers that contain a two older implementations of
the CONFIG_RTC_DRV_CMOS driver.

This removes x86 from the list for genrtc, and changes all references
to the asm/rtc.h header to instead point to the interfaces
from linux/mc146818rtc.h.
