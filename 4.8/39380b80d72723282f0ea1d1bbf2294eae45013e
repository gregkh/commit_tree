x86/mm/pat, /dev/mem: Remove superfluous error message

Currently it's possible for broken (or malicious) userspace to flood a
kernel log indefinitely with messages a-la

	Program dmidecode tried to access /dev/mem between f0000->100000

because range_is_allowed() is case of CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM being turned on
dumps this information each and every time devmem_is_allowed() fails.

Reportedly userspace that is able to trigger contignuous flow of these
messages exists.

It would be possible to rate limit this message, but that'd have a
questionable value; the administrator wouldn't get information about all
the failing accessess, so then the information would be both superfluous
and incomplete at the same time :)

Returning EPERM (which is what is actually happening) is enough indication
for userspace what has happened; no need to log this particular error as
some sort of special condition.
