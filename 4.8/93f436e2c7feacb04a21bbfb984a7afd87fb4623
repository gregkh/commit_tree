iwlwifi: mvm: set sta_id in SCD_QUEUE_CONFIG cmd

Set the correct sta_id in the SCD_QUEUE_CONFIG command sent
to the FW when enabling/disabling queues. This is needed in
DQA-mode to allow the FW to associate between queue and STA.

In case the queue isn't connected to a specific station but
rather is a static "generic" queue - the sta_id should be
set to 0x10 (max supported STA is 0x0f).
