ARM: keystone: fix missing keystone.h in pm_domain.c

The declaration of keystone_pm_runtime_init() is not included
from keystone.h in pm_domain.c. Including the file fixes the
following sparse warning:

arch/arm/mach-keystone/pm_domain.c:37:12: warning: symbol 'keystone_pm_runtime_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
