MIPS: KVM: Fix translation of MFC0 ErrCtl

The MIPS KVM dynamic translation is meant to translate "MFC0 rt, ErrCtl"
instructions into "ADD rt, zero, zero" to zero the destination register,
however the rt register number was copied into rt of the ADD instruction
encoding, which is the 2nd source operand. This results in "ADD zero,
zero, rt" which is a no-op, so only the first execution of each such
MFC0 from ErrCtl will actually read 0.

Fix the shift to put the rt from the MFC0 encoding into the rd field of
the ADD.
