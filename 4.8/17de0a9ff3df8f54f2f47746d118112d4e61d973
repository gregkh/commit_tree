iomap: don't set FIEMAP_EXTENT_MERGED for extent based filesystems

Filesystems like XFS that use extents should not set the
FIEMAP_EXTENT_MERGED flag in the fiemap extent structures.  To allow
for both behaviors for the upcoming gfs2 usage split the iomap
type field into type and flags, and only set FIEMAP_EXTENT_MERGED if
the IOMAP_F_MERGED flag is set.  The flags field will also come in
handy for future features such as shared extents on reflink-enabled
file systems.
