Revert "Revert "dts: msm8974: Add dma channels for blsp2_i2c1 node""

This adds back the dma channels for the i2c1 node.  This is safe now
that the qcom,controlled-remotely changes are in place and will be used
on the boards that require it.

This reverts commit 10c0f0e92f019ab8d0c17da3696e35b0eef4ec16.
