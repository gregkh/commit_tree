crypto: kpp - Key-agreement Protocol Primitives API (KPP)

Add key-agreement protocol primitives (kpp) API which allows to
implement primitives required by protocols such as DH and ECDH.
The API is composed mainly by the following functions
 * set_secret() - It allows the user to set his secret, also
   referred to as his private key, along with the parameters
   known to both parties involved in the key-agreement session.
 * generate_public_key() - It generates the public key to be sent to
   the other counterpart involved in the key-agreement session. The
   function has to be called after set_params() and set_secret()
 * generate_secret() - It generates the shared secret for the session

Other functions such as init() and exit() are provided for allowing
cryptographic hardware to be inizialized properly before use
