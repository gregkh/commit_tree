gpio: acpi: add _DEP support for Acer One 10

On Acer One 10, the ACPI battery driver can not be probed because
it depends on the GPIO controller as well as the I2C controller to work,
        Device (BATC)
        {
            Name (_HID, EisaId ("PNP0C0A") /* Control Method Battery */)
            ...
            Name (_DEP, Package (0x03)  // _DEP: Dependencies
            {
                I2C1,
                GPO2,
                GPO0
            })
            ...
        }

The I2C dependency also exists on other platforms and has been fixed by commit
40e7fcb19293 ("ACPI: Add _DEP support to fix battery issue on Asus T100TA"),
this patch resolves the GPIO dependency for Acer One 10.
