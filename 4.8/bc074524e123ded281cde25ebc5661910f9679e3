btrfs: prefix fsid to all trace events

When using trace events to debug a problem, it's impossible to determine
which file system generated a particular event.  This patch adds a
macro to prefix standard information to the head of a trace event.

The extent_state alloc/free events are all that's left without an
fs_info available.
