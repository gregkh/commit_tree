x86: include linux/ratelimit.h in nmi.c

When building random configurations, we now occasionally get a new
build error:

   In file included from include/linux/kernel.h:13:0,
                    from include/linux/list.h:8,
                    from include/linux/preempt.h:10,

                    from arch/x86/kernel/nmi.c:13:

This was working before the rtc rework series because linux/ratelimit.h
was included implictly through asm/mach_traps.h -> asm/mc146818rtc.h
-> linux/mc146818rtc.h -> linux/rtc.h -> linux/device.h.

We clearly shouldn't rely on this indirect inclusion, so this adds
an explicit #include in the file that needs it.
