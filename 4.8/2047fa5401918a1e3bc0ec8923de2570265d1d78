iwlwifi: pcie: unify restock calls on init

Currently code calls restock for mq devices during the init
function, unlike sq where restock is called after init.
This causes an harmless but alarming deadlock warning from
lockdep, to fix this - unify the init code.
Rename the restock functions while at it.
