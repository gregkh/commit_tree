staging/lustre/llite: take trunc_sem only at vvp layer

The lli_trunc_sem is taken in 'read' mode in both
ll_page_mkwrite and vvp_io_fault_start. This can lead to a
deadlock with another thread which asks for the semaphore
in write mode between thse two read calls.

Since all users of lli_trunc_sem are in the vvp layer, we
can satisfy the requirement to exclude truncate by taking
the semaphore only in vvp_io_fault_start.
