ext4: check for extents that wrap around

An extent with lblock = 4294967295 and len = 1 will pass the
ext4_valid_extent() test:

	ext4_lblk_t last = lblock + len - 1;

	if (len == 0 || lblock > last)
		return 0;

since last = 4294967295 + 1 - 1 = 4294967295. This would later trigger
the BUG_ON(es->es_lblk + es->es_len < es->es_lblk) in ext4_es_end().

We can simplify it by removing the - 1 altogether and changing the test
to use lblock + len <= lblock, since now if len = 0, then lblock + 0 ==
lblock and it fails, and if len > 0 then lblock + len > lblock in order
to pass (i.e. it doesn't overflow).
