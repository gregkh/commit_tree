drm/i915: Delay queuing hangcheck to wait-request

We can forgo queuing the hangcheck from the start of every request to
until we wait upon a request. This reduces the overhead of every
request, but may increase the latency of detecting a hang. However, if
nothing every waits upon a hang, did it ever hang? It also improves the
robustness of the wait-request by ensuring that the hangchecker is
indeed running before we sleep indefinitely (and thereby ensuring that
we never actually sleep forever waiting for a dead GPU).

As pointed out by Tvrtko, it is possible for a GPU hang to go unnoticed
for as long as nobody is waiting for the GPU. Though this rare, during
that time we may be consuming more power than if we had promptly
recovered, and in the most extreme case we may exhaust all memory before
forcing the hangcheck. Something to be wary off in future.
