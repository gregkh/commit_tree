ARM: davinci: fix build break because of undeclared dm365_evm_snd_data

commit 6bce5efd4424 ("ARM: davinci: remove unused davinci-i2s pdata")
removed all instances of davinci-i2s pdata. However, on DM365 EVM,
the same platform data is passed to the voicecodec present on that
device.

This causes build breakage when voicecodec support is enabled:

arch/arm/mach-davinci/board-dm365-evm.c:764:17: error: 'dm365_evm_snd_data' undeclared (first use in this function)

voicecodec driver does not use the platform data as well, and
it is safe to remove it.
