clockevents: Make clockevents_subsys static

The clockevents_subsys struct is used for sysfs support and
is not declared or used outside the file it is defined in.
Fix the following warning by making it static:

kernel/time/clockevents.c:648:17: warning: symbol 'clockevents_subsys' was not declared. Should it be static?
