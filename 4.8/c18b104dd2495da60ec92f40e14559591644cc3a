mwifiex: Fix endianness for event TLV type TLV_BTCOEX_WL_SCANTIME

The two members min_scan_time and max_scan_time of structure
"mwifiex_ie_types_btcoex_scan_time" are of two bytes each. The values
are assigned directtly from firmware without endian conversion handling.
So, wrong datas will get saved in big-endian systems.

This patch converts the values into cpu's byte order before assigning them
into the local members.
