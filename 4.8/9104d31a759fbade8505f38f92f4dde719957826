drbd: introduce WRITE_SAME support

We will support WRITE_SAME, if
 * all peers support WRITE_SAME (both in kernel and DRBD version),
 * all peer devices support WRITE_SAME
 * logical_block_size is identical on all peers.

We may at some point introduce a fallback on the receiving side
for devices/kernels that do not support WRITE_SAME,
by open-coding a submit loop. But not yet.
