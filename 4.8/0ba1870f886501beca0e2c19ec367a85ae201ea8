spi: omap2-mcspi: Use the SPI framework to handle DMA mapping

Currently, the driver handles mapping buffers to be used by the DMA.
However, there are times that the current mapping implementation will
fail for certain buffers. Fortunately, the SPI framework can detect
and map buffers so its usable by the DMA.

Update the driver to utilize the SPI framework for buffer
mapping instead. Also incorporate hooks that the framework uses to
determine if the DMA can or can not be used.

This will result in the original omap2_mcspi_transfer_one function being
deleted and omap2_mcspi_work_one being renamed to
omap2_mcspi_transfer_one. Previously transfer_one was only responsible
for mapping and work_one handled the transfer. But now only transferring
needs to be handled by the driver.
