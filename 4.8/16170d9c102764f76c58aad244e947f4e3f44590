IB/hfi1: Rework debugfs to use SRCU

The debugfs RCU trips many debug kernel warnings because of potential
sleeps with an RCU read lock held. This includes both user copy calls
and slab allocations throughout the file.

This patch switches the RCU to use SRCU for file remove/access
race protection.

In one case, the SRCU is implicit in the use of the raw debugfs file
object and just works.

In the seq_file case, a wrapper around seq_read() and seq_lseek() is
used to enforce the SRCU using the debugfs supplied functions
debugfs_use_file_start() and debugfs_use_file_stop().

The sychronize_rcu() is deleted since the SRCU prevents the remove
access race.

The RCU locking is kept for qp_stats since the QP hash list is
protected using the non-sleepable RCU.
