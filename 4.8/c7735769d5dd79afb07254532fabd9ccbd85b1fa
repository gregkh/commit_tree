KVM: arm64: ITS: move ITS registration into first VCPU run

Currently we register an ITS device upon userland issuing the CTLR_INIT
ioctl to mark initialization of the ITS as done.
This deviates from the initialization sequence of the existing GIC
devices and does not play well with the way QEMU handles things.
To be more in line with what we are used to, register the ITS(es) just
before the first VCPU is about to run, so in the map_resources() call.
This involves iterating through the list of KVM devices and map each
ITS that we find.
