arm64: Kconfig: select ALPINE_MSI only if PCI is selected

Even when PCI is disabled, ARCH_ALPINE selects ALPINE_MSI triggerring
the following config warning:

warning: (ARCH_ALPINE) selects ALPINE_MSI which has unmet direct
		dependencies (PCI)

This patch makes selection of ALPINE_MSI conditional on PCI.
