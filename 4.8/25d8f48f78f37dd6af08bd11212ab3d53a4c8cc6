perf config: Constructor should free its allocated memory when failing

Because of die() at perf_parse_file() a config set was freed in
collect_config(), if failed.  But it is natural to free a config set
after collect_config() is done when some problems happened.

So, in case of failure, lastly free a config set at perf_config_set__new()
instead of freeing the config set in collect_config().
