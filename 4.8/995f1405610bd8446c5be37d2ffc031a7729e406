rcu: Suppress sparse warnings for rcu_dereference_raw()

Data structures that are used both with and without RCU protection
are difficult to write in a sparse-clean manner.  If you mark the
relevant pointers with __rcu, sparse will complain about all non-RCU
uses, but if you don't mark those pointers, sparse will complain about
all RCU uses.

This commit therefore suppresses sparse warnings for rcu_dereference_raw(),
allowing mixed-protection data structures to avoid these warnings.
