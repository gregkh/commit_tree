crypto: rsa-pkcs1pad - Handle leading zero for decryption

As the software RSA implementation now produces fixed-length
output, we need to eliminate leading zeros in the calling code
instead.

This patch does just that for pkcs1pad decryption while signature
verification was fixed in an earlier patch.
