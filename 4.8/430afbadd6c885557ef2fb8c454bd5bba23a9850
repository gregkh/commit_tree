ceph: mount non-default filesystem by name

To mount non-default filesytem, user currently needs to provide mds
namespace ID. This is inconvenience.

This patch makes user be able to mount filesystem by name. If user
wants to mount non-default filesystem. Client first subscribes to
fsmap.user. Subscribe to mdsmap.<ID> after getting ID of filesystem.
