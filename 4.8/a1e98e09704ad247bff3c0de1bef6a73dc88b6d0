rtc: rv8803: Fix read day of week

The Weekday register is encoded as 2^tm_wday, with tm_wday in 0..6, so
using tm_wday = ffs(reg) to fill tm_wday from the register value is
wrong because this gives the expected value + 1. This could be fixed as
tm_wday = ffs(reg) - 1, but tm_wday = ilog2(reg) works as well and is
more direct.
