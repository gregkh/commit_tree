[media] cec: add HDMI CEC framework (adapter)

The added HDMI CEC framework provides a generic kernel interface for
HDMI CEC devices.

Note that the CEC framework is added to staging/media and that the
cec.h and cec-funcs.h headers are not exported yet. While the kABI
is mature, I would prefer to allow the uABI some more time before
it is mainlined in case it needs more tweaks.

This adds the cec-adap.c source that deals with the low-level CEC
messaging and logical address handling.
