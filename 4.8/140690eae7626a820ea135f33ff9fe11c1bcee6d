IB/hfi1: Fetch monitor values on-demand for CableInfo query

The monitor values from bytes 22 through 81 of the QSFP memory space
(SFF 8636) are dynamic and serving them out of the QSFP memory cache
maintained by the driver provides stale data to the CableInfo SMA query.
This patch refreshes the dynamic values from the QSFP memory on request
and overwrites the stale data from the cache for the overlap between the
requested range and the monitor range.
