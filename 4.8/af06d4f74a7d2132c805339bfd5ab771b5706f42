rcuperf: Don't treat gp_exp mis-setting as a WARN

0day found a boot warning triggered in rcu_perf_writer() on !SMP kernel:

	WARN_ON(rcu_gp_is_normal() && gp_exp);

, the root cause of which is trying to measure expedited grace
periods(by setting gp_exp to true by default) when all the grace periods
are normal(TINY RCU only has normal grace periods).

However, such a mis-setting would only result in failing to measure the
performance for a specific kind of grace periods, therefore using a
WARN_ON to check this is a little overkilling. We could handle this
inside rcuperf module via some error messages to tell users about the
mis-settings.

Therefore this patch removes the WARN_ON in rcu_perf_writer() and
handles those checkings in rcu_perf_init() with plain if() code.

Moreover, this patch changes the default value of gp_exp to 1) align
with rcutorture tests and 2) make the default setting work for all RCU
implementations by default.
