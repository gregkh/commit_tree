staging: wilc1000: arrays can't be NULL

hif_drv->usr_scan_req.net.net_info[i] contains found_net_info structs
which have the following element:
u8 bssid[6];

pstrNetworkInfo, of type network_info, also contains an u8 array named
bssid.

request->ssids is an array of cfg80211_ssid structs. Making ssid:
u8 ssid[IEEE80211_MAX_SSID_LEN];

In these 3 cases the arrays are being checked against NULL, which can't
happen. Removing the checks since they will always be true.

Found with smatch:
