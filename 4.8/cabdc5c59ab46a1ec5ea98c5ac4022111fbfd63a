KVM: arm/arm64: timer: Workaround misconfigured timer interrupt

Similarily to f005bd7e3b84 ("clocksource/arm_arch_timer: Force
per-CPU interrupt to be level-triggered"), make sure we can
survive an interrupt that has been misconfigured as edge-triggered
by forcing it to be level-triggered (active low is assumed, but
the GIC doesn't really care whether this is high or low).

Hopefully, the amount of shouting in the kernel log will convince
the user to do something about their firmware.
