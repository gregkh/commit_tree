ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: Fix McBSP2/3 sidetone data

The McBSPLP's sidetone main clock is the McBSPLP's ICLK, not FCLK as the
sidetone only receives the ICLK from the main McBSP module.
Since the McBSP and sidetone is using the very same clock from PRCM level
the sidetone must not have the prcm section to check the clock status since
the sidetone is only used when McBSP is already configured.
If two separate hwmods looking at the same bit and they would use
pm_runtime in nested way (as it must happen with McBSP and it's ST module)
the hwmod would warn, because the idlest will not match what it is expected
after enable/disable of the clocks.
