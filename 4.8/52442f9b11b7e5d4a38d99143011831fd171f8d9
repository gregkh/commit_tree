NFS4: Avoid migration loops

If a server returns itself as a location while migrating, the client may
end up getting stuck attempting to migrate twice to the same server.  Catch
this by checking if the nfs_client found is the same as the existing
client.  For the other two callers to nfs4_set_client, the nfs_client will
always be ERR_PTR(-EINVAL).
