rxrpc: Kill off the rxrpc_transport struct

The rxrpc_transport struct is now redundant, given that the rxrpc_peer
struct is now per peer port rather than per peer host, so get rid of it.

Service connection lists are transferred to the rxrpc_peer struct, as is
the conn_lock.  Previous patches moved the client connection handling out
of the rxrpc_transport struct and discarded the connection bundling code.
