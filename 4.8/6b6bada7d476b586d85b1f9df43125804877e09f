drm/i915/gen9: Reject display updates that exceed wm limitations (v2)

If we can't find any valid level 0 watermark values for the requested
atomic transaction, reject the configuration before we try to start
programming the hardware.

v2:
 - Add extra debugging output when we reject level 0 watermarks so that
   we can more easily debug how/why they were rejected.
