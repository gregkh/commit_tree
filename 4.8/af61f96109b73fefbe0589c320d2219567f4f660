extcon: link devres into core module

Splitting the resource-managed functions into a separate module
means that the extcon core now fails to build because the internal
"extcon_dev_allocate" symbol is not exported:

ERROR: extcon_dev_allocate [drivers/extcon/devres.ko] undefined!

My guess is that the intention was not to have two separate
modules (which could be fixed by adding an export, plus the
normal MODULE_AUTHOR/MODULE_LICENSE/... fields), but have two
source files in the same module.

This fixes the Makefile accordingly, making the name of the
module extcon_core.ko, which is created from building both
extcon.c and devres.c.
