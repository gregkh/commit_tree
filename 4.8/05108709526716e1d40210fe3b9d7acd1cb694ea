MIPS: KVM: Add KScratch registers

Allow up to 6 KVM guest KScratch registers to be enabled and accessed
via the KVM guest register API and from the guest itself (the fallback
reading and writing of commpage registers is sufficient for KScratch
registers to work as expected).

User mode can expose the registers by setting the appropriate bits of
the guest Config4.KScrExist field. KScratch registers that aren't usable
won't be writeable via the KVM Ioctl API.
