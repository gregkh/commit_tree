init/Kconfig: ban CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO with allmodconfig

Doing patches with allmodconfig kernel compiled and committing stuff
into local tree have unfortunate consequence: kernel version changes (as
it should) leading to recompiling and relinking of several files even if
they weren't touched (or interesting at all).  This and "git-whatever"
figuring out current version slow down compilation for no good reason.

But lets face it, "allmodconfig" kernels don't care about kernel
version, they are simply compile check guinea pigs.

Make LOCALVERSION_AUTO depend on !COMPILE_TEST, so it doesn't sneak into
allmodconfig .config.
