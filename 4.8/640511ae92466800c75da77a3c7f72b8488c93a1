MIPS: c-r4k: Exclude sibling CPUs in SMP calls

When performing SMP calls to foreign cores, exclude sibling CPUs from
the provided map, as we already handle the local core on the current
CPU. This prevents an SMP call from for example core 0, VPE 1 to VPE 0
on the same core.

In the process the cpu_foreign_map cpumask is turned into an array of
cpumasks, so that each CPU has its own version of it which excludes
sibling CPUs. r4k_op_needs_ipi() is also updated to reflect that cache
management SMP calls are not needed when all CPUs are siblings (i.e.
there are no foreign CPUs according to the new cpu_foreign_map[]
semantics which exclude siblings).
