ASoC: nau8825: Export I2C module alias information

The I2C driver has an i2c_device_id array but that information isn't
exported to the module using the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro. So the
module autoloading won't work if the I2C device is registered using
OF or legacy board files due missing alias information in the module.

The issue was found using Kieran Bingham's coccinelle semantic patch:
