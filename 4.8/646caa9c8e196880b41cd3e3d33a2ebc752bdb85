ext4: fix deadlock during page writeback

Commit 06bd3c36a733 (ext4: fix data exposure after a crash) uncovered a
deadlock in ext4_writepages() which was previously much harder to hit.
After this commit xfstest generic/130 reproduces the deadlock on small
filesystems.

The problem happens when ext4_do_update_inode() sets LARGE_FILE feature
and marks current inode handle as synchronous. That subsequently results
in ext4_journal_stop() called from ext4_writepages() to block waiting for
transaction commit while still holding page locks, reference to io_end,
and some prepared bio in mpd structure each of which can possibly block
transaction commit from completing and thus results in deadlock.

Fix the problem by releasing page locks, io_end reference, and
submitting prepared bio before calling ext4_journal_stop().

[ Changed to defer the call to ext4_journal_stop() only if the handle
  is synchronous.  --tytso ]
