arm/perf: Fix hotplug state machine conversion

Mark Rutland pointed out that this commit is incomplete:

  7d88eb695a1f ("arm/perf: Convert to hotplug state machine")

The problem is that:

 > We may have multiple PMUs (e.g. two in big.LITTLE systems), and
 > __oprofile_cpu_pmu only contains one of these. So this conversion is not
 > correct.
 >
 > We were relying on the notifier list implicitly containing a list of
 > those PMUs. It seems like we need an explicit list here.
 >
 > We keep __oprofile_cpu_pmu around for legacy 32-bit users of OProfile
 > (on non-hetereogeneous systems), and that's all that the variable should
 > be used for.

Introduce arm_pmu_list to correctly handle multiple PMUs in the system.
