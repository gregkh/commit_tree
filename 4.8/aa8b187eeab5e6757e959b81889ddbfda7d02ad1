hwmon: (it87) Features mask must be 32 bit wide

Coverity reports:

result_independent_of_operands: data->features & (65536UL /* 1UL << 16 */)
is always 0 regardless of the values of its operands. This occurs as the
logical operand of if.

data->features needs to be 32 bit wide since there are more than 16 features.
