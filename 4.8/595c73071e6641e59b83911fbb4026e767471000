libnvdimm, region: fix flush hint table thinko

The definition of the flush hint table as:

	void __iomem *flush_wpq[0][0];

...passed the unit test, but is broken as flush_wpq[0][1] and
flush_wpq[1][0] refer to the same entry.  Fix this to use a helper that
calculates a slot in the table based on the geometry of flush hints in
the region.  This is important to get right since virtualization
solutions use this mechanism to trigger hypervisor flushes to platform
persistence.
