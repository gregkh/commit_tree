ACPI: add support for ACPI reconfiguration notifiers

Add support for ACPI reconfiguration notifiers to allow subsystems
to react to changes in the ACPI tables that happen after the initial
enumeration. This is similar with the way dynamic device tree
notifications work.

The reconfigure notifications supported for now are device add and
device remove.

Since ACPICA allows only one table notification handler, this patch
makes the table notifier function generic and moves it out of the
sysfs specific code.
