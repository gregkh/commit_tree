powerpc/32: Fix again csum_partial_copy_generic()

Commit 7aef4136566b0 ("powerpc32: rewrite csum_partial_copy_generic()
based on copy_tofrom_user()") introduced a bug when destination address
is odd and len is lower than cacheline size.

In that case the resulting csum value doesn't have to be rotated one
byte because the cache-aligned copy part is skipped so no alignment
is performed.
