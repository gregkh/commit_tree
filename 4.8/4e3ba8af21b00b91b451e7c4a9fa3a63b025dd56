Revert "perf tools: event.h needs asm/perf_regs.h"

This reverts commit e083a21fcac9311ca425e600a15332f4792c56cc.

Not needed at all, tools/perf/util/perf_regs.h, included via:

  #include "perf_regs.h"

Should have a definition for PERF_REGS_MAX, and since this is dependent
on HAVE_PERF_REGS_SUPPORT, fixes the build on powerpc, noticed by trying
to cross compile this from ubuntu16.04 with a locally build libz &
elfutils pair, since those are not available in multilib packages.
