pinctrl: fix pincontrol definition for marvell

On Marvell mv88f6180 with pin control driver one can not use multi
purpose pins 35 through 44.
I'm using this controller on an embedded board and i found that the
pin multiplexing is not the same as in the hardware spezification.
This patch alters the pin description so that mpp pins 0 to 19 as well
as 35 to 44 are usable.

Pin settings i used can be found here:
