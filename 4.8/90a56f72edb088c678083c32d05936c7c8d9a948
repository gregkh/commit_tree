Bluetooth: Fix bt_sock_recvmsg when MSG_TRUNC is not set

Commit b5f34f9420b50c9b5876b9a2b68e96be6d629054 attempt to introduce
proper handling for MSG_TRUNC but recv and variants should still work
as read if no flag is passed, but because the code may set MSG_TRUNC to
msg->msg_flags that shall not be used as it may cause it to be behave as
if MSG_TRUNC is always, so instead of using it this changes the code to
use the flags parameter which shall contain the original flags.
