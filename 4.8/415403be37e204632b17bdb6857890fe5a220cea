zram: use crypto api to check alg availability

There is no way to get a string with all the crypto comp algorithms
supported by the crypto comp engine, so we need to maintain our own
backends list.  At the same time we additionally need to use
crypto_has_comp() to make sure that the user has requested a compression
algorithm that is recognized by the crypto comp engine.  Relying on
/proc/crypto is not an options here, because it does not show
not-yet-inserted compression modules.

Example:

 modprobe zram
 cat /proc/crypto | grep -i lz4
 modprobe lz4
 cat /proc/crypto | grep -i lz4
name         : lz4
driver       : lz4-generic
module       : lz4

So the user can't tell exactly if the lz4 is really supported from
/proc/crypto output, unless someone or something has loaded it.

This patch also adds crypto_has_comp() to zcomp_available_show().  We
store all the compression algorithms names in zcomp's `backends' array,
regardless the CONFIG_CRYPTO_FOO configuration, but show only those that
are also supported by crypto engine.  This helps user to know the exact
list of compression algorithms that can be used.

Example:
  module lz4 is not loaded yet, but is supported by the crypto
  engine. /proc/crypto has no information on this module, while
  zram's `comp_algorithm' lists it:

 cat /proc/crypto | grep -i lz4

 cat /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm
[lzo] lz4 deflate lz4hc 842

We still use the `backends' array to determine if the requested
compression backend is known to crypto api.  This array, however, may not
contain some entries, therefore as the last step we call crypto_has_comp()
function which attempts to insmod the requested compression algorithm to
determine if crypto api supports it.  The advantage of this method is that
now we permit the usage of out-of-tree crypto compression modules
(implementing S/W or H/W compression).
