KVM: Extend struct kvm_msi to hold a 32-bit device ID

The ARM GICv3 ITS MSI controller requires a device ID to be able to
assign the proper interrupt vector. On real hardware, this ID is
sampled from the bus. To be able to emulate an ITS controller, extend
the KVM MSI interface to let userspace provide such a device ID. For
PCI devices, the device ID is simply the 16-bit bus-device-function
triplet, which should be easily available to the userland tool.

Also there is a new KVM capability which advertises whether the
current VM requires a device ID to be set along with the MSI data.
This flag is still reported as not available everywhere, later we will
enable it when ITS emulation is used.
