mm: memcontrol: remove BUG_ON in uncharge_list

When calling uncharge_list, if a page is transparent huge we don't need
to BUG_ON about non-transparent huge, since nobody should be able to see
the page at this stage and this page cannot be raced against with a THP
split.

This check became unneeded after 0a31bc97c80c ("mm: memcontrol: rewrite
uncharge API").
