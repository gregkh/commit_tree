btrfs: Handle uninitialised inode eviction

The code flow in btrfs_new_inode allows for btrfs_evict_inode to be
called with not fully initialised inode (e.g. ->root member not
being set). This can happen when btrfs_set_inode_index in
btrfs_new_inode fails, which in turn would call iput for the newly
allocated inode. This in turn leads to vfs calling into btrfs_evict_inode.
This leads to null pointer dereference. To handle this situation check whether
the passed inode has root set and just free it in case it doesn't.
