ARM: dts: sun8i-q8-common: Add support for USB wifi controllers

Some of the sun8i q8 boards have an usb wifi controller, on other
variants this will result in an used usb root-hub, but the best
way to deal with wifi on this boards is to simply let the kernel
auto-detect usb or sdio wifi controllers.

This has been tested on an a23 based q8 tablet with a RTL8188ETV wifi
controller.
