xfrm: Only add l3mdev oif to dst lookups

Subash reported that commit 42a7b32b73d6 ("xfrm: Add oif to dst lookups")
broke a wifi use case that uses fib rules and xfrms. The intent of
42a7b32b73d6 was driven by VRFs with IPsec. As a compromise relax the
use of oif in xfrm lookups to L3 master devices only (ie., oif is either
an L3 master device or is enslaved to a master device).
