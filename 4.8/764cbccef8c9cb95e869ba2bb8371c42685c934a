bpf: add sample for xdp forwarding and rewrite

Add a sample that rewrites and forwards packets out on the same
interface. Observed single core forwarding performance of ~10Mpps.

Since the mlx4 driver under test recycles every single packet page, the
perf output shows almost exclusively just the ring management and bpf
program work. Slowdowns are likely occurring due to cache misses.
