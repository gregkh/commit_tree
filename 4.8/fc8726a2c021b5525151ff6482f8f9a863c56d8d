clk: core: support clocks which requires parents enable (part 2)

On Freescale i.MX7D platform, all clocks operations, including
enable/disable, rate change and re-parent, requires its parent clock on.
Current clock core can not support it well.
This patch adding flag CLK_OPS_PARENT_ENABLE to handle this special case in
clock core that enable its parent clock firstly for each operation and
disable it later after operation complete.

The patch part 2 fixes set clock rate and set parent while its parent
is off. The most special case is for set_parent() operation which requires
all parents including both old and new one to be enabled at the same time
during the operation.
