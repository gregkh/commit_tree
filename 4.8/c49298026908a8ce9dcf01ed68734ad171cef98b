IB/hfi1: Allow for non-double word multiple message sizes for user SDMA

The driver pads non-double word multiple message sizes but it doesn't
account for this padding when the packet length is calculated. Also, the
data length is miscalculated for message sizes less than 4 bytes due to
the bit representation in LRH. And there's a check for non-double word
multiple message sizes that prevents these messages from being sent.
This patch fixes length miscalculations and enables the functionality to
send non-double word multiple message sizes.
