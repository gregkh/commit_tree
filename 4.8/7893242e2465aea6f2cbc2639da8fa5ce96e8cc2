CIFS: Fix a possible invalid memory access in smb2_query_symlink()

During following a symbolic link we received err_buf from SMB2_open().
While the validity of SMB2 error response is checked previously
in smb2_check_message() a symbolic link payload is not checked at all.
Fix it by adding such checks.
