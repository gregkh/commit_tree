arm64: kprobes instruction simulation support

Kprobes needs simulation of instructions that cannot be stepped
from a different memory location, e.g.: those instructions
that uses PC-relative addressing. In simulation, the behaviour
of the instruction is implemented using a copy of pt_regs.

The following instruction categories are simulated:
 - All branching instructions(conditional, register, and immediate)
 - Literal access instructions(load-literal, adr/adrp)

Conditional execution is limited to branching instructions in
ARM v8. If conditions at PSTATE do not match the condition fields
of opcode, the instruction is effectively NOP.

Thanks to Will Cohen for assorted suggested changes.
