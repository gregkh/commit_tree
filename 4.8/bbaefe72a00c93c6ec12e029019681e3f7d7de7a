drm/i915: Mimic skl with WaForceEnableNonCoherent

Past evidence with system hangs and hsds tie
WaForceEnableNonCoherent and WaDisableHDCInvalidation to
WaForceContextSaveRestoreNonCoherent. Documentation
states that WaForceContextSaveRestoreNonCoherent would
not be needed on skl past E0 but evidence proved otherwise. See
commit <510650e8b2ab> ("drm/i915/skl: Fix spurious gpu hang with gt3/gt4
revs"). In this scope consider kbl to be skl with a bigger revision than
E0 so play it safe and bind these two workarounds to the
WaForceContextSaveRestoreNonCoherent, and apply to all gen9.
