mm/kasan: get rid of ->state in struct kasan_alloc_meta

The state of object currently tracked in two places - shadow memory, and
the ->state field in struct kasan_alloc_meta.  We can get rid of the
latter.  The will save us a little bit of memory.  Also, this allow us
to move free stack into struct kasan_alloc_meta, without increasing
memory consumption.  So now we should always know when the last time the
object was freed.  This may be useful for long delayed use-after-free
bugs.

As a side effect this fixes following UBSAN warning:
	UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in mm/kasan/quarantine.c:102:13
	member access within misaligned address ffff88000d1efebc for type 'struct qlist_node'
	which requires 8 byte alignment
