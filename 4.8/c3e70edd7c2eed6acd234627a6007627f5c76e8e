Revert "phy: IRQ cannot be shared"

This reverts:
  commit 33c133cc7598 ("phy: IRQ cannot be shared")

On hardware with multiple PHY devices hooked up to the same IRQ line, allow
them to share it.

Sergei Shtylyov says:
  "I'm not sure now what was the reason I concluded that the IRQ sharing
  was impossible... most probably I thought that the kernel IRQ handling
  code exited the loop over the IRQ actions once IRQ_HANDLED was returned
  -- which is obviously not so in reality..."
