ASoC: intel: Fix sst-dsp dependency on dw stuff

The recent commit [a92ea59b74e2: ASoC: Intel: sst: only select
sst-firmware when DW DMAC is built-in] introduced more strict kconfig
dependency (depends on DW_DMAC_CORE=y) for avoiding the build failures
due to dependency messes in intel-sst.  This makes, however, it
impossible to use this driver with the modularized systems,
i.e. typically on Linux distros.

The problem addressed in the commit above is that sst_dsp_new() and
sst_dsp_free() includes the firmware init / finish that call dw_*()
functions.  Thus building it as built-in with DW_DMAC_CORE module
results in the missing symbols.

However, these sst_dsp functions are basically called only from the
drivers that depend on DW_DMAC_CORE already.  That is, once when these
functions are split out, the rest can be independent from dw stuff.

This patch attempts to solve the issue by the following:
- Split sst-dsp stuff into two modules: snd-soc-sst-dsp and
  snd-soc-sst-firmware.
- Move sst_dsp_new() and sst_dsp_free() to the latter module so that
  the former module can be independent from DW_DMAC_CORE.
- Add a new kconfig SND_SOC_INTEL_SST_FIRMWARE to select the latter
  module by machine drivers.

One only remaining pitfall is that each machine driver has to select
SND_SOC_INTEL_SST_FIRMWARE carefully depending on DW_DMAC_CORE.
This can't be done cleanly due to the restriction of the current
kbuild.
