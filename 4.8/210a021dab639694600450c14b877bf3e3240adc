drm/edid: Set 8 bpc color depth for displays with "DFP 1.x compliant TMDS".

According to E-EDID spec 1.3, table 3.9, a digital video sink with the
"DFP 1.x compliant TMDS" bit set is "signal compatible with VESA DFP 1.x
TMDS CRGB, 1 pixel / clock, up to 8 bits / color MSB aligned".

For such displays, the DFP spec 1.0, section 3.10 "EDID support" says:

"If the DFP monitor only supports EDID 1.X (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
 without extensions, the host will make the following assumptions:

 1. 24-bit MSB-aligned RGB TFT
 2. DE polarity is active high
 3. H and V syncs are active high
 4. Established CRT timings will be used
 5. Dithering will not be enabled on the host"

So if we don't know the bit depth of the display from additional
colorimetry info we should assume 8 bpc / 24 bpp by default.

This patch adds info->bpc = 8 assignement for that case.
