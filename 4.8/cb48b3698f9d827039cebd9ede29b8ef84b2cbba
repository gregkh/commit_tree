[media] media: rc: nuvoton: remove interrupt handling for wakeup

There is a rudimentary ISR for handling interrupts generated by the
wakeup part of the chip. Interrupts however have never been enabled
in the wakeup part.
Also, now that we can set the wakeup sequence via sysfs, there's in
general no need to enable interrupts in the wakeup part.
