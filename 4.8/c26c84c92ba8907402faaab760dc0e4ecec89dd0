ARM: OMAP3: pdata-quirks: Add support for McBSP2/3 sidetone handling

McBSP2/3 module's sidetone module operates using the module's ICLK clock.
When the Sidetone is in use the interface clock of the module must not
idle. To prevent the iclk idling the driver expects to have pdata callback
to call. With this patch the callback is going to be set up for DT boot
also.
