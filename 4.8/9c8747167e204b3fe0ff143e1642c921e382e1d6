block: atari: Return early for unsupported sector size

For 4K LBA or very large disks, atari_partition can easily get tricked
into thinking it has found an Atari partition table.  Depending on the
data in the disk, it ends up creating partitions with awkward lengths.

We saw logs like this while playing with fio.

[5.625867] nvme2n1: AHDI p2
[5.625872] nvme2n1: p2 size 2910030523 extends beyond EOD, truncated

People has had issues with misinterpreted AHDI partition tables for a long
time, see this BSD thread from 1995, for example.

Since the atari partition, according to the spec, doesn't even support
sector sizes with more than 512, a quick sanity check is reasonable to
just bail out early, before even attempting to read sector 0.
