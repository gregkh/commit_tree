crypto: tcrypt - Fix memory leaks/crashes in multibuffer hash speed test

This patch resolves a number of issues with the mb speed test
function:

* The tfm is never freed.
* Memory is allocated even when we're not using mb.
* When an error occurs we don't wait for completion for other requests.
* When an error occurs during allocation we may leak memory.
* The test function ignores plen but still runs for plen != blen.
* The backlog flag is incorrectly used (may crash).

This patch tries to resolve all these issues as well as making
the code consistent with the existing hash speed testing function.
