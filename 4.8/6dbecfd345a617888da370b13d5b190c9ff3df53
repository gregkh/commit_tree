PM / hibernate: Simplify mark_unsafe_pages()

Rework mark_unsafe_pages() to use a simpler method of clearing
all bits in free_pages_map and to set the bits for the "unsafe"
pages (ie. pages that were used by the image kernel before
hibernation) with the help of duplicate_memory_bitmap().

For this purpose, move the pfn_valid() check from mark_unsafe_pages()
to unpack_orig_pfns() where the "unsafe" pages are discovered.
