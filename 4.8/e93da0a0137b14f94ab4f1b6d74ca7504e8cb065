drm/i915/bxt: Sanitiy check the PHY lane power down status

We can check the power state of the PHY data and common lanes as
reported by the PHY. Do this in case we need to debug problems where the
PHY gets stuck in an unexpected state.

Note that I only check these when the lanes are expected to be powered
on purpose, since it's not clear at what point the PHY power/clock gates
things.

v2:
- Don't report the encoder as disabled when the sanity check fails.
