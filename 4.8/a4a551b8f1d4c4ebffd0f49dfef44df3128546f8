ftrace: Reduce size of function graph entries

Currently ftrace_graph_ent{,_entry} and ftrace_graph_ret{,_entry} struct
can have padding bytes at the end due to alignment in 64-bit data type.
As these data are recorded so frequently, those paddings waste
non-negligible space.  As the ring buffer maintains alignment properly
for each architecture, just to remove the extra padding using 'packed'
attribute.

  ftrace_graph_ent_entry:  24 -> 20
  ftrace_graph_ret_entry:  48 -> 44

Also I moved the 'overrun' field in struct ftrace_graph_ret to minimize
the padding in the middle.

Tested on x86_64 only.
