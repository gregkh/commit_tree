ARM: dts: exynos: Configure PWM, usb3503, PMIC and thermal on Odroid XU board

Extend the DTS for Exynos5410-based Odroid XU board with:
1. Proper PWM outputs,
2. usb3503 USB HUB (with integrated LAN9730 ethernet adapter (smsc95xx)),
3. Maxim 77802 PMIC (regulators, 32 kHz clocks, RTC),
4. CPU thermal (trip points are the same as in Odroid XU3/XU4 but
   cooling maps are different as there is no CPU freq and only one
   cluster available for now),
5. Regulator supplies for USB 3.0.
