KVM: s390: provide CMMA attributes only if available

Let's not provide the device attribute for cmma enabling and clearing
if the hardware doesn't support it.

This also helps getting rid of the undocumented return value "-EINVAL"
in case CMMA is not available when trying to enable it.

Also properly document the meaning of -EINVAL for CMMA clearing.
