mtd: nand: mxc: fix obiwan error in mxc_nand_v[12]_ooblayout_free() functions

commit a894cf6c5a82 ("mtd: nand: mxc: switch to mtd_ooblayout_ops")
introduced a regression accessing the OOB area from the mxc_nand
driver due to an Obiwan error in the mxc_nand_v[12]_ooblayout_free()
functions. They report a bogus oobregion { 64, 7 } which leads to
errors accessing bogus data when reading the oob area.

Prior to the commit the mtd-oobtest module could be run without any
errors. With the offending commit, this test fails with results like:
