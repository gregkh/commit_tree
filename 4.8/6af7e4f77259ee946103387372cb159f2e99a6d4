PCI: Mark Haswell Power Control Unit as having non-compliant BARs

The Haswell Power Control Unit has a non-PCI register (CONFIG_TDP_NOMINAL)
where BAR 0 is supposed to be.  This is erratum HSE43 in the spec update
referenced below:

  The PCIe* Base Specification indicates that Configuration Space Headers
  have a base address register at offset 0x10.  Due to this erratum, the
  Power Control Unit's CONFIG_TDP_NOMINAL CSR (Bus 1; Device 30; Function
  3; Offset 0x10) is located where a base register is expected.

Mark the PCU as having non-compliant BARs so we don't try to probe any of
them.  There are no other BARs on this device.

Rename the quirk so it's not Broadwell-specific.
