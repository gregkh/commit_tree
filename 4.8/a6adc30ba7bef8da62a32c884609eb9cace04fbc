clk: introduce clk_core_enable_lock and clk_core_disable_lock functions

This can be useful when clock core wants to enable/disable clocks.
Then we don't have to convert the struct clk_core to struct clk to call
clk_enable/clk_disable which is a bit un-align with exist using.

And after introduce clk_core_{enable|disable}_lock, we can refine
clk_enable and clk_disable a bit.

As well as clk_core_{enable|disable}_lock, we also added
clk_core_{prepare|unprepare}_lock and clk_core_prepare_enable/
clk_core_unprepare_disable for clock core to easily use.
