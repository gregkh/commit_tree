drm/i915/bxt: Fix inadvertent CPU snooping due to incorrect MOCS config

Setting a write-back cache policy in the MOCS entry definition also
implies snooping, which has a considerable overhead. This is
unexpected for a few reasons:
- From user-space's point of view since it didn't want a coherent
  surface (it didn't set the buffer as such via the set caching IOCTL).
- There is a separate MOCS entry field for snooping (which we never
  set).
- This MOCS table is about caching in (e)LLC and there is no (e)LLC on
  BXT. There is a separate table for L3 cache control.

Considering the above the current behavior of snooping looks like an
unintentional side-effect of the WB setting. Changing it to be LLC-UC
gets rid of the snooping without any ill-effects. For a coherent
surface the application would use a separate MOCS entry at index 1 and
call the set caching IOCTL to setup the PTE entries for the
corresponding buffer to be snooped. In the future we could also add a
new MOCS entry for coherent surfaces.

This resulted in 70% improvement in synthetic texturing benchmarks.

Kudos to Valtteri Rantala, Eero Tamminen and Michael T Frederick and
Ville who helped to narrow the source of problem to the kernel and to
the snooping behaviour in particular.

With a follow-up change to adjust the 3rd entry value
igt/gem_mocs_settings is passing after this change.

v2:
- Rebase on v2 of patch 1/2.
v3:
- Set the entry as LLC uncached instead of PTE-passthrough. This way
  we also keep snooping disabled, but we also make the cacheability/
  coherency setting indepent of the PTE which is managed by the
  kernel. (Chris)
