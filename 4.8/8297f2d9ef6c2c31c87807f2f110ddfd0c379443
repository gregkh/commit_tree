connector: make cn_proc explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig controlling build of this code is currently:

drivers/connector/Kconfig:config PROC_EVENTS
drivers/connector/Kconfig:      bool "Report process events to userspace"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the two modular references, so that when reading the driver
there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.
