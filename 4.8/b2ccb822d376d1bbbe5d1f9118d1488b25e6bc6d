drm/i915: Enable/disable TMDS output buffers in DP++ adaptor as needed

To save a bit of power, let's try to turn off the TMDS output buffers
in DP++ adaptors when we're not driving the port.

v2: Let's not forget DDI, toss in a debug message while at it
v3: Just do the TMDS output control based on adaptor type. With the
    helper getting passed the type, we wouldn't actually have to
    check at all in the driver, but the check eliminates the debug
    output more honest
