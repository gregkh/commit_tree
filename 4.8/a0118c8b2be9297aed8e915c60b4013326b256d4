crypto: caam - fix non-hmac hashes

Since 6de62f15b581 ("crypto: algif_hash - Require setkey before
accept(2)"), the AF_ALG interface requires userspace to provide a key
to any algorithm that has a setkey method.  However, the non-HMAC
algorithms are not keyed, so setting a key is unnecessary.

Fix this by removing the setkey method from the non-keyed hash
algorithms.
