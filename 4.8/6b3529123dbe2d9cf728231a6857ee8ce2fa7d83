bnx2x: Move all UDP port notifiers to single function

This patch goes through and combines the notifiers for VXLAN and GENEVE
into a single function for each action.  So there is now one combined
function for getting ports, one for adding the ports, and one for deleting
the ports.

I also went through and dropped the BNX2X VXLAN and GENEVE specific build
flags.
