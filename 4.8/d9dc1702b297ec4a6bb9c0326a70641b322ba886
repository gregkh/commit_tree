bcache: register_bcache(): call blkdev_put() when cache_alloc() fails

register_cache() is supposed to return an error string on error so that
register_bcache() will will blkdev_put and cleanup other user counters,
but it does not set 'char *err' when cache_alloc() fails (eg, due to
memory pressure) and thus register_bcache() performs no cleanup.

register_bcache() <----------\  <- no jump to err_close, no blkdev_put()
   |                         |
   +->register_cache()       |  <- fails to set char *err
         |                   |
         +->cache_alloc() ---/  <- returns error

This patch sets `char *err` for this failure case so that register_cache()
will cause register_bcache() to correctly jump to err_close and do
cleanup.  This was tested under OOM conditions that triggered the bug.
