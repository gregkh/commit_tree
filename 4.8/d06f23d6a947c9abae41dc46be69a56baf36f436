btrfs: waiting on qgroup rescan should not always be interruptible

We wait on qgroup rescan completion in three places: file system
shutdown, the quota disable ioctl, and the rescan wait ioctl.  If the
user sends a signal while we're waiting, we continue happily along.  This
is expected behavior for the rescan wait ioctl.  It's racy in the shutdown
path but mostly works due to other unrelated synchronization points.
In the quota disable path, it Oopses the kernel pretty much immediately.
