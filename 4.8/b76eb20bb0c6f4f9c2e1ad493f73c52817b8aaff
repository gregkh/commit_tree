lightnvm: move target mgmt into media mgr

To enable persistent block management to easily control creation and
removal of targets, we move target management into the media
manager. The LightNVM core continues to maintain which target types are
registered, while the media manager now keeps track of its initialized
targets.

Two new callbacks for the media manager are introduced. create_tgt and
remove_tgt. Note that remove_tgt returns 0 on successfully removing a
target, and returns 1 if the target was not found.
