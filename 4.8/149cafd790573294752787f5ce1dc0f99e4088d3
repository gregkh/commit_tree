net: dsa: tag_{e}dsa.c: Remove dependency on platform data

The platform data nr_chips is used when validating a received packet,
to ensure it comes from a know switch chip. The number of possible
switches is limited to DSA_MAX_SWITCHES, so use this as the first
validation step. The new binding allows holes in the dst->ds[] array,
so also ensure ensure there is a valid dsa_switch for this packet.
