s390/topology: remove z10 special handling

I don't have a z10 to test this anymore, so I have no idea if the code
works at all or even crashes. I can try to emulate, but it is just
guess work.

Nor do we know if the z10 special handling is performance wise still
better than the generic handling. There have been a lot of changes to
the scheduler.

Therefore let's play safe and remove the special handling.
