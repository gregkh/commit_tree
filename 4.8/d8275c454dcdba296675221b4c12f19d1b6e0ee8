tracing: Move filtered_pid helper functions into trace.c

As the filtered_pid functions are going to be used by function tracer as
well as trace_events, move the code into the generic trace.c file.

The functions moved are:

 trace_find_filtered_pid()
 trace_ignore_this_task()
 trace_filter_add_remove_task()

Kernel Doc text was also added.
