PM / devfreq: make event/exynos-nocp DEVFREQ_EVENT_EXYNOS_NOCP tristate

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

event/Kconfig:config DEVFREQ_EVENT_EXYNOS_NOCP
event/Kconfig:  bool "EXYNOS NoC (Network On Chip) Probe DEVFREQ event Driver"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Rather than rip out the existing modular code, Chanwoo indicated
that he'd rather see the driver offered as tristate.

I don't have the hardware for runtime validation, so this change
is only validated for compile and modpost.
