drm/i915: Make 308 and 671 MHz cdclks more accurate on SKL

The SKL 308.57 MHz cdclk is probably 8640/28 = ~308.571 Mhz.
Similartly the 617.14 MHz cdclk is probably 8640/14 = ~617.143 MHz.
Let's use the slightly more accurate numbers. Potentially we might
change to computing all of these based on dividers, but let's
stick to the current theme for now..
