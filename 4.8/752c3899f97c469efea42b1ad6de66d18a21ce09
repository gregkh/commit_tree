i2c: bcm-kona: Use complete() instead of complete_all()

There is only one waiter for the completion, therefore there
is no need to use complete_all(). Let's make that clear by
using complete() instead of complete_all().

The usage pattern of the completion is:

bcm_kona_send_i2c_cmd()
  reinit_completion()
  ...
  bcm_kona_i2c_send_cmd_to_ctrl()
  ...
  wait_for_completion_timeout()
