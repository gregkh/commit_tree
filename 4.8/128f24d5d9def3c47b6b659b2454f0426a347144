xfs: check for a valid error_tag in errortag_add

Currently we don't check the error_tag when someone's trying to set up
error injection testing.  If userspace passes in a value we don't know
about, send back an error.  This will help xfstests to _notrun a test
that uses error injection to test things like log replay.
