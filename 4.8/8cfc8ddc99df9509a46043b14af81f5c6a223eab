pstore: add lzo/lz4 compression support

Like zlib compression in pstore, this patch added lzo and lz4
compression support so that users can have more options and better
compression ratio.

The original code treats the compressed data together with the
uncompressed ECC correction notice by using zlib decompress. The
ECC correction notice is missing in the decompression process. The
treatment also makes lzo and lz4 not working. So I treat them
separately by using pstore_decompress() to treat the compressed
data, and memcpy() to treat the uncompressed ECC correction notice.
