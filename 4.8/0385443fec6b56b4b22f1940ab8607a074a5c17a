[media] Remove spurious blank lines in dw2101 kernel messages

The DW2102 DVB-S/S2 driver uses the info() logging function from
dvb-usb.h. This function already appends a newline to the provided log
message, causing the dmesg output from DW2102 to include blank lines.
Fix this by removing the newline in the calls to info().
