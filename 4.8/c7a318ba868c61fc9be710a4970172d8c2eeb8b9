powerpc/ptrace: Fix coredump since ptrace TM changes

Commit 8d460f6156cd ("powerpc/process: Add the function
flush_tmregs_to_thread") added flush_tmregs_to_thread() and included
the assumption that it would only be called for a task which is not
current.

Although this is correct for ptrace, when generating a core dump, some
of the routines which call flush_tmregs_to_thread() are called. This
leads to a WARNing such as:

  Not expecting ptrace on self: TM regs may be incorrect

So fix flush_tmregs_to_thread() to detect the case where it is called on
current, and a transaction is active, and in that case flush the TM regs
to the thread_struct.

This patch also moves flush_tmregs_to_thread() into ptrace.c as it is
only called from that file.
