drm/i915: Separate GPU hang waitqueue from advance

Currently __i915_wait_request uses a per-engine wait_queue_t for the dual
purpose of waking after the GPU advances or for waking after an error.
In the future, we may add even more wake sources and require greater
separation, but for now we can conceptually simplify wakeups by separating
the two sources. In particular, this allows us to use different wait-queues
(e.g. one on the engine advancement, a global one for errors and one on
each requests) without any hassle.
