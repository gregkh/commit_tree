fault_in_multipages_readable() throws set-but-unused error

When building XFS with -Werror, it now fails with:

  include/linux/pagemap.h: In function 'fault_in_multipages_readable':
  include/linux/pagemap.h:602:16: error: variable 'c' set but not used [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]
    volatile char c;
                  ^

This is a regression caused by commit e23d4159b109 ("fix
fault_in_multipages_...() on architectures with no-op access_ok()").
Fix it by re-adding the "(void)c" trick taht was previously used to make
the compiler think the variable is used.
