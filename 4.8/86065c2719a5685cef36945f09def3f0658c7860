xhci: don't rely on precalculated value of needed trbs in the enqueue loop

Queue trbs until all payload data in the urb is tranferred.

The actual number of trbs might need to change from the pre-calculated
number when the packet alignment restrictions for td fragments in
xhci 4.11.7.1 are taken into account.

Long term plan is to get rid of calculating the needed trbs in advance
all together. It's an unnecessary extra walk through the scatterlist.

This change also allows some bulk queue function simplifications
