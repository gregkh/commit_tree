tick/nohz: Optimize nohz idle enter

tick_nohz_start_idle is called before checking whether the idle tick can be
stopped. If the tick cannot be stopped, calling tick_nohz_start_idle() is
pointless and just wasting CPU cycles.

Only invoke tick_nohz_start_idle() when can_stop_idle_tick() returns true. A
short one minute observation of the effect on ARM64 shows a reduction of calls
by 1.5% thus optimizing the idle entry sequence.
