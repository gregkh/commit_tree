shmem: add huge pages support

Here's basic implementation of huge pages support for shmem/tmpfs.

It's all pretty streight-forward:

  - shmem_getpage() allcoates huge page if it can and try to inserd into
    radix tree with shmem_add_to_page_cache();

  - shmem_add_to_page_cache() puts the page onto radix-tree if there's
    space for it;

  - shmem_undo_range() removes huge pages, if it fully within range.
    Partial truncate of huge pages zero out this part of THP.

    This have visible effect on fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE)
    behaviour. As we don't really create hole in this case,
    lseek(SEEK_HOLE) may have inconsistent results depending what
    pages happened to be allocated.

  - no need to change shmem_fault: core-mm will map an compound page as
    huge if VMA is suitable;
