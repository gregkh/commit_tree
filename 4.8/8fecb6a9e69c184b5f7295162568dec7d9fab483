drm/radeon: Forbid runtime pm on driver unload

The PCI core calls pm_runtime_forbid() on device probe in pci_pm_init(),
making this the default state when radeon is loaded.
radeon_driver_load_kms() therefore calls pm_runtime_allow(), but there's
no pm_runtime_forbid() in radeon_driver_unload_kms() to balance it. Add
it so that we leave the device in the same state that we found it.

This isn't a bug, it's just good housekeeping. When radeon is first
loaded with runpm=1, then unloaded and loaded again with runpm=0,
pm_runtime_forbid() will be called from radeon_pmops_runtime_idle() or
radeon_pmops_runtime_suspend(), so the behaviour is correct. If there
ever is a third party driver for AMD cards, this commit avoids that it
has to clean up behind radeon.
