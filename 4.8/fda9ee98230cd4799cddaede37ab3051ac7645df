drm/i915: Move panel's backlight setup next to panel init

Currently setting up the backlight for a panel is sometimes done
together with initialising the panel, and sometimes after the connector
is registered. The backlight setup does not depend upon connector
registration (i.e. access to sysfs/debugfs and the kobject hierachy) so
perform it consistently just after panel initialisation.

Note the discrepancy here as destroying the panel is done during
connector unregistration...
