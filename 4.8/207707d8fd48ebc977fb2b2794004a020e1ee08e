usb: gadget: rndis: free response queue during REMOTE_NDIS_RESET_MSG

When rndis data transfer is in progress, some Windows7 Host PC is not
sending the GET_ENCAPSULATED_RESPONSE command for receiving the response
for the previous SEND_ENCAPSULATED_COMMAND processed.

The rndis function driver appends each response for the
SEND_ENCAPSULATED_COMMAND in a queue. As the above process got corrupted,
the Host sends a REMOTE_NDIS_RESET_MSG command to do a soft-reset.
As the rndis response queue is not freed, the previous response is sent
as a part of this REMOTE_NDIS_RESET_MSG's reset response and the Host
block any more Rndis transfers.

Hence free the rndis response queue as a part of this soft-reset so that
the correct response for REMOTE_NDIS_RESET_MSG is sent properly during the
response command.
