ath10k: define rx_ppdu_end for QCA9984

QCA9984 Rx descriptor has two 32-bit words of location information
when compared to one 32-bit word in QCA99X0. To handle this difference in
rx descriptor ppdu_end, define a new ppdu_end for QCA9984 descriptor
which has the new structure to represent rx_location_info.
