arm64: mm: simplify memblock numa node extraction

We currently open-code extracting the NUMA node of a memblock region,
which requires an ifdef to cater for !CONFIG_NUMA builds where the
memblock_region::nid field does not exist.

The generic memblock_get_region_node helper is intended to cater for
this. For CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP, builds this returns reg->nid,
and for for !CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP builds this is a static
inline that returns 0. Note that for arm64,
CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP is selected iff CONFIG_NUMA is.

This patch makes use of memblock_get_region_node to simplify the arm64
code. At the same time, we can move the nid variable definition into the
loop, as this is the only place it is used.
