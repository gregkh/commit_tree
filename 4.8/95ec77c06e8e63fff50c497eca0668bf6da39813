powerpc: Make ppc_md.{halt, restart} __noreturn

powernv marks it's halt and restart calls as __noreturn. However,
ppc_md does not have this annotation. Add the annotation to ppc_md,
and then to every halt/restart function that is missing it.

Additionally, I have verified that all of these functions do not
return. Occasionally I have added a spin loop to be sure.
