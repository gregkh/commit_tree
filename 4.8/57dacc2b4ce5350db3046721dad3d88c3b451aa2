tpm: tpm_tis: Share common data between phys

Split priv_data structure in common and phy specific structures. This will
allow in future patches to reuse the same tis logic on top of new phy such
as spi and i2c. Ultimately, other drivers may reuse this tis logic.
(e.g: st33zp24...)

iobase field is specific to TPM addressed on 0xFED4xxxx on LPC/SPI bus.

This commit is based on the initial work by Peter Huewe.
