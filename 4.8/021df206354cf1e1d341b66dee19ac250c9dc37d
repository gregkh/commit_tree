MIPS: KVM: Simplify even/odd TLB handling

When handling TLB faults in the guest KSeg0 region, a pair of physical
addresses are read from the guest physical address map. However that
process is rather convoluted with an if/then/else statement. Simplify it
to just clear the lowest bit for the even entry and set the lowest bit
for the odd entry.
