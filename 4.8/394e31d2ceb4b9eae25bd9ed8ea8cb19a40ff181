mem-hotplug: alloc new page from a nearest neighbor node when mem-offline

If we offline a node, alloc the new page from a nearest neighbor node
instead of the current node or other remote nodes, because re-migrate is
a waste of time and the distance of the remote nodes is often very
large.

Also use GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE to alloc new page if the zone is movable
zone or highmem zone.
