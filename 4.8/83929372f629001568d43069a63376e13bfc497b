filemap: prepare find and delete operations for huge pages

For now, we would have HPAGE_PMD_NR entries in radix tree for every huge
page.  That's suboptimal and it will be changed to use Matthew's
multi-order entries later.

'add' operation is not changed, because we don't need it to implement
hugetmpfs: shmem uses its own implementation.
