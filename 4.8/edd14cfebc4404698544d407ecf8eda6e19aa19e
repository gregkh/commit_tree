genirq: Add untracked irq handler

This adds a software irq handler for controllers that multiplex
interrupts from multiple devices, but don't know which device generated
the interrupt. For these devices, the irq handler that demuxes must
check every action for every software irq using the same h/w irq in order
to find out which device generated the interrupt. This will inevitably
trigger spurious interrupt detection if we are noting the irq.

The new irq handler does not track the handling for spurious interrupt
detection. An irq that uses this also won't get stats tracked since it
didn't generate the interrupt, nor added to randomness since they are
not random.
