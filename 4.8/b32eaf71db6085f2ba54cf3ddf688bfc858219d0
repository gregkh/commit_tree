mm: clarify COMPACTION Kconfig text

The current wording of the COMPACTION Kconfig help text doesn't
emphasise that disabling COMPACTION might cripple the page allocator
which relies on the compaction quite heavily for high order requests and
an unexpected OOM can happen with the lack of compaction.  Make sure we
are vocal about that.
