xfs: rmap btree transaction reservations

The rmap btrees will use the AGFL as the block allocation source, so
we need to ensure that the transaction reservations reflect the fact
this tree is modified by allocation and freeing. Hence we need to
extend all the extent allocation/free reservations used in
transactions to handle this.

Note that this also gets rid of the unused XFS_ALLOCFREE_LOG_RES
macro, as we now do buffer reservations based on the number of
buffers logged via xfs_calc_buf_res(). Hence we only need the buffer
count calculation now.
