usb: dwc3: core: allow device to runtime_suspend several times

After going through runtime_suspend/runtime_resume
cycle once we would be left with an unbalanced
pm_runtime_get() call. Fix that by making sure that
we try to suspend right after resuming so things are
balanced and device can runtime_suspend again.
