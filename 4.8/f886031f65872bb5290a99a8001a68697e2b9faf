pinctrl: Always recurse into bcm folder

drivers/pinctrl/bcm/Makefile properly builds individual drivers based on
their respective Kconfig symbols. ARCH_BCM is currently a menuconfig
option from arch/arm/mach-bcm/Kconfig, which is fine, but prevents ARM64
platforms which do not have such menuconfig option from building their
pinctrl drivers, so let's get rid of that dependency.
