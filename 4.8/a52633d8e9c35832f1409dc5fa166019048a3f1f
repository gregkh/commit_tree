mm, vmscan: move lru_lock to the node

Node-based reclaim requires node-based LRUs and locking.  This is a
preparation patch that just moves the lru_lock to the node so later
patches are easier to review.  It is a mechanical change but note this
patch makes contention worse because the LRU lock is hotter and direct
reclaim and kswapd can contend on the same lock even when reclaiming
from different zones.
