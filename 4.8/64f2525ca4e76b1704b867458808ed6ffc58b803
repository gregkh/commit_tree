igb: Only DMA sync frame length

On some platforms, syncing a buffer for DMA is expensive. Rather than
sync the whole 2K receive buffer, only synchronise the length of the
frame, which will typically be the MTU, or a much smaller TCP ACK.

For an IMX6Q, this gives around 6% increased TCP receive performance,
which is cache operations bound and reduces CPU load for TCP transmit.
