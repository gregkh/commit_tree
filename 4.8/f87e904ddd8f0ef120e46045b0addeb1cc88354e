rtc: s35390a: fix reading out alarm

There are several issues fixed in this patch:

 - When alarm isn't enabled, set .enabled to zero instead of returning
   -EINVAL.
 - Ignore how IRQ1 is configured when determining if IRQ2 is on.
 - The three alarm registers have an enable flag which must be
   evaluated.
 - The chip always triggers when the seconds register gets 0.

Note that the rtc framework however doesn't handle the result correctly
because it doesn't check wday being initialized and so interprets an
alarm being set for 10:00 AM in three days as 10:00 AM tomorrow (or
today if that's not over yet).
