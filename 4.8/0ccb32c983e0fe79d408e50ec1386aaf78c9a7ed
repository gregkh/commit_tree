s390/mm: align swapper_pg_dir to 16k

The segment/region table that is part of the kernel image must be
properly aligned to 16k in order to make the crdte inline assembly
work.
Otherwise it will calculate a wrong segment/region table start address
and access incorrect memory locations if the swapper_pg_dir is not
aligned to 16k.

Therefore define BSS_FIRST_SECTIONS in order to put the swapper_pg_dir
at the beginning of the bss section and also align the bss section to
16k just like other architectures did.
