powerpc/mm: Catch usage of cpu/mmu_has_feature() before jump label init

This allows us to catch incorrect usage of cpu_has_feature() and
mmu_has_feature() prior to jump labels being initialised.

mpe: Use printk() and dump_stack() rather than WARN_ON(), because
WARN_ON() may not work this early in boot. Rename the Kconfig.
