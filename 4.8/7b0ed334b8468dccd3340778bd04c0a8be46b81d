i2c: i801: add support of Host Notify

The i801 chip can handle the Host Notify feature since ICH 3 as mentioned
in http://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/datasheet/82801ca-io-controller-hub-3-datasheet.pdf

Enable the functionality unconditionally and propagate the alert
on each notification.

With a T440s and a Synaptics touchpad that implements Host Notify, the
payload data is always 0x0000, so I am not sure if the device actually
sends the payload or if there is a problem regarding the implementation.
