byteswap: don't use __builtin_bswap*() with sparse

Although sparse declares __builtin_bswap*(), it can't actually do
constant folding inside them (yet).  As such, things like

  switch (protocol) {
  case htons(ETH_P_IP):
          break;
  }

which we do all over the place cause sparse to warn that it expects a
constant instead of a function call.

Disable __HAVE_BUILTIN_BSWAP*__ if __CHECKER__ is defined to avoid this.
