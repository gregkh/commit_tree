drm: Initialize a linear gamma table by default

Code stolen from gma500.

This is just a minor bit of safety code that I spotted and figured it
might be useful if we put it into the core. This is to make the
get_gamma ioctl reflect likely reality even before the first set_gamma
ioctl call.

v2 on irc: Extend commit message per Maarten's suggestions.
