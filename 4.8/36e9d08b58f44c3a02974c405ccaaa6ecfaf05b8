drm/cirrus: Fix NULL pointer dereference when registering the fbdev

cirrus_modeset_init() is initializing/registering the emulated fbdev
and, since commit c61b93fe51b1 ("drm/atomic: Fix remaining places where
!funcs->best_encoder is valid"), DRM internals can access/test some of
the fields in mode_config->funcs as part of the fbdev registration
process.
Make sure dev->mode_config.funcs is properly set to avoid dereferencing
a NULL pointer.
