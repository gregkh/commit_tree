mm/page_owner: introduce split_page_owner and replace manual handling

split_page() calls set_page_owner() to set up page_owner to each pages.
But, it has a drawback that head page and the others have different
stacktrace because callsite of set_page_owner() is slightly differnt.
To avoid this problem, this patch copies head page's page_owner to the
others.  It needs to introduce new function, split_page_owner() but it
also remove the other function, get_page_owner_gfp() so looks good to
do.
