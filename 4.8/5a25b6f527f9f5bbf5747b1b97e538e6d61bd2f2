powerpc/mm: Make MMU_FTR_RADIX a MMU family feature

MMU feature bits are defined such that we use the lower half to
present MMU family features. Remove the strict split of half and
also move Radix to a mmu family feature. Radix introduce a new MMU
model and strictly speaking it is a new MMU family. This also free
up bits which can be used for individual features later.
