net-next: mediatek: add support for IRQ grouping

The ethernet core has 3 IRQs. Using the IRQ grouping registers we are able
to separate TX and RX IRQs, which allows us to service them on separate
cores. This patch splits the IRQ handler into 2 separate functions, one for
TX and another for RX. The TX housekeeping is split out into its own NAPI
handler.
