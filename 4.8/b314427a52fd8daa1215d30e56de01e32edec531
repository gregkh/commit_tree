powerpc/powernv: Fix crash on releasing compound PE

The compound PE is created to accommodate the devices attached to
one specific PCI bus that consume multiple M64 segments. The compound
PE is made up of one master PE and possibly multiple slave PEs. The
slave PEs should be destroyed when releasing the master PE. A kernel
crash happens when derferencing @pe->pdev on releasing the slave PE
in pnv_ioda_deconfigure_pe().

It fixes the kernel crash by bypassing releasing resources (DMA,
IO and memory segments, PELTM) because there are no resources assigned
to the slave PE.
