vfs: Generalize filesystem nodev handling.

Introduce a function may_open_dev that tests MNT_NODEV and a new
superblock flab SB_I_NODEV.  Use this new function in all of the
places where MNT_NODEV was previously tested.

Add the new SB_I_NODEV s_iflag to proc, sysfs, and mqueuefs as those
filesystems should never support device nodes, and a simple superblock
flags makes that very hard to get wrong.  With SB_I_NODEV set if any
device nodes somehow manage to show up on on a filesystem those
device nodes will be unopenable.
