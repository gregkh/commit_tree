perf/core: Rename the perf_event_aux*() APIs to perf_event_sb*(), to separate them from AUX ring-buffer records

There are now two different things called AUX in perf, the
infrastructure to deliver the mmap/comm/task records and the
AUX part in the mmap buffer (with associated AUX_RECORD).

Since the former is internal, rename it to side-band to reduce
the confusion factor.

No change in functionality.
