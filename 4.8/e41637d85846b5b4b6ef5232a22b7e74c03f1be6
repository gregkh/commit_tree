MIPS: KVM: Make entry code MIPS64 friendly

The MIPS KVM entry code (originally kvm_locore.S, later locore.S, and
now entry.c) has never quite been right when built for 64-bit, using
32-bit instructions when 64-bit instructions were needed for handling
64-bit registers and pointers. Fix several cases of this now.

The changes roughly fall into the following categories.

- COP0 scratch registers contain guest register values and the VCPU
  pointer, and are themselves full width. Similarly CP0_EPC and
  CP0_BadVAddr registers are full width (even though technically we
  don't support 64-bit guest address spaces with trap & emulate KVM).
  Use MFC0/MTC0 for accessing them.

- Handling of stack pointers and the VCPU pointer must match the pointer
  size of the kernel ABI (always o32 or n64), so use ADDIU.

- The CPU number in thread_info, and the guest_{user,kernel}_asid arrays
  in kvm_vcpu_arch are all 32 bit integers, so use lw (instead of LW) to
  load them.
