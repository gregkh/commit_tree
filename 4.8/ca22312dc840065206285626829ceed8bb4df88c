x86/platform/intel-mid: Extend PWRMU to support Penwell

Intel Penwell is one of the first SoCs in Intel MID series. It has slightly
older version of PWRMU IP, though it is compatible with one found on Intel
Tangier. Since we are not using (yet) any advanced stuff in the driver we may
safely re-use what it's done for Intel Tangier for now.

Extend PWRMU driver to support Intel Penwell by adding PCI ID and re-using
existing ->set_initial_state() function.
