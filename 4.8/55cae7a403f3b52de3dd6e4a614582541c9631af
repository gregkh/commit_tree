rxrpc: fix uninitialized pointer dereference in debug code

A newly added bugfix caused an uninitialized variable to be
used for printing debug output. This is harmless as long
as the debug setting is disabled, but otherwise leads to an
immediate crash.

gcc warns about this when -Wmaybe-uninitialized is enabled:

net/rxrpc/call_object.c: In function 'rxrpc_release_call':
net/rxrpc/call_object.c:496:163: error: 'sp' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The initialization was removed but one of the users remains.
This adds back the initialization.
