ia64: salinfo: use a waitqueue instead a sema down/up combo

The only purpose of down_try_lock() followed by up() seems to be to wake
up a possible reader. This patch replaces it with a wake-queue. There is
no locking around cpumask_empty() and the test is re-done in case there
was no hit.
With wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq(,&data_saved_lock) we would probably
be able to get rid of the `retry` label. However we still can return CPU
X which is valid now but later (after the lock dropped) the event may
have been removed because the CPU went offline.
