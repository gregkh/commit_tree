tools: Pass arg to fdarray__filter's call back function

Before this patch there's no way to pass arguments to fdarray__filter's
call back function.

This improvement will be used by 'perf record' to support unmapping ring
buffer for both main evlist and overwrite evlist. Without this patch
there's no way to track overwrite evlist from 'struct fdarray'.
