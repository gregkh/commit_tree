net/mlx5e: Don't wait for SQ completions on close

Instead of asking the firmware to flush the SQ (Send Queue) via
asynchronous completions when moved to error, we handle SQ flush
manually (mlx5e_free_tx_descs) same as we did when SQ flush got
timed out or on tx_timeout.

This will reduce SQs flush time and speedup interface down procedure.

Moved mlx5e_free_tx_descs to the end of en_tx.c for tx
critical code locality.
