PM / OPP: optimize dev_pm_opp_set_rate() performance a bit

In dev_pm_opp_set_rate(), _find_opp_table() is called 4 times: once by
_get_opp_clk(), once by dev_pm_opp_set_rate() itself, and twice by
dev_pm_opp_find_freq_ceil(). If there are several opp_tables in the
system, three times of opp table finding is a big waste. This patch
reduced the call of _find_opp_table() to twice.
