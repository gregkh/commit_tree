s390: hypfs: Move diag implementation and data definitions

Diag 204 data and function definitions currently live in the hypfs
files. As KVM will be a consumer of this data, we need to make it
publicly available and move it to the appropriate diag.{c,h} files.

__attribute__ ((packed)) occurences were replaced with __packed for
all moved structs.
