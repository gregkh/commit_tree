ARM: sa1100: register clocks early

Since we switched to use pxa_timer, we need to provide the OSTIMER0
clock.  However, as the clock is initialised early, we need to provide
the clock early as well, so that pxa_timer can find it.  Adding the
clock to the clkdev table at core_initcall() time is way too late.

Move the initialisation earlier.
