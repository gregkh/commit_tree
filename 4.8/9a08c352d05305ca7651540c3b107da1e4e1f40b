fs: add filp_clone_open API

I need an API that allows me to obtain a clone of the current file
pointer to pass in to an exec handler.  I've labelled this as an
internal API because I can't see how it would be useful outside of the
fs subsystem.  The use case will be a persistent binfmt_misc handler.
