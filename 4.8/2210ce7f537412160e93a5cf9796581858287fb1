drm/i915: Replace some open coded intel_crtc_has_dp_encoder()s

A bunch of places still look for DP encoders manually. Just call
intel_crtc_has_dp_encoder(). Note that many of these places don't
look for EDP or DP_MST, but it's still fine to replace them because
* for audio we don't enable audio on eDP anyway
* the code that lack DP MST check is only for plaforms that
  don't support MST anyway

v2: Rebase
