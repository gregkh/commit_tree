ASoC: max98504: Add max98504 speaker amplifier driver

This patch adds driver for the MAX98504 speaker amplifier.  The MAX98504
is a high efficiency mono class D amplifier that features an integrated
boost converter with voltage and current sensing ADCs for Dynamic Speaker
Management.
This driver does not include support for the I2S DAI, as we wouldn't be
able  to test such code in a hardware configuration where the amplifier
has only wired the analogue input.

 related parts, rewrote regmap configuration code, added support for speaker
 enable and global chip enable through DAPM, rewritten as component driver,
 added PDM DAI definition and TDM callbacks for PDM channels configuration]
