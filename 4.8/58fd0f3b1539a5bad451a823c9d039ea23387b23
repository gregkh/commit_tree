ntb_perf: Return results by reading the run file

Instead of having to watch logs, allow the results to be retrieved
by reading back the run file. This file will return "running" when
the test is running and nothing if no tests have been run yet.
It returns 1 line per thread, and will display an error message if the
corresponding thread returns an error.

With the above change, the pr_info calls that returned the results are
then changed to pr_debug calls.
