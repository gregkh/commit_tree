rtc: pcf85063: Add support for the PCF85063A device

The current rtc-pcf85063 driver only supports the PCF85063TP device.
Using the existing driver on a PCF85063A will result in the time being
set correctly into the RTC, but the RTC is held in the stopped state.
Therefore, the time will no longer advance and no error is indicated.

The PCF85063A device has a bigger memory map than the PCF85063TP.
The existing driver make use of an address rollover condition,
but the rollover point is different in the two devices.
