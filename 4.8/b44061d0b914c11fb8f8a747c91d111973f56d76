nfsd: reorganize nfsd_create

There's some odd logic in nfsd_create() that allows it to be called with
the parent directory either locked or unlocked.  The only already-locked
caller is NFSv2's nfsd_proc_create().  It's less confusing to split out
the unlocked case into a separate function which the NFSv2 code can call
directly.

Also fix some comments while we're here.
