net: vrf: Implement get_saddr for IPv6

IPv6 source address selection needs to consider the real egress route.
Similar to IPv4 implement a get_saddr6 method which is called if
source address has not been set.  The get_saddr6 method does a full
lookup which means pulling a route from the VRF FIB table and properly
considering linklocal/multicast destination addresses. Lookup failures
(eg., unreachable) then cause the source address selection to fail
which gets propagated back to the caller.
