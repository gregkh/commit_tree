bpf, trace: add BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU flag for bpf_perf_event_read

Follow-up commit to 1e33759c788c ("bpf, trace: add BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU
flag for bpf_perf_event_output") to add the same functionality into
bpf_perf_event_read() helper. The split of index into flags and index
component is also safe here, since such large maps are rejected during
map allocation time.
