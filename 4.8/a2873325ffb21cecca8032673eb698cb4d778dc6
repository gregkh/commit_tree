perf unwind: Add initialized arg into unwind__prepare_access

Adding initialized arg into unwind__prepare_access to get feedback about
the initialization state.

It's not possible to get it from error code, because we return 0 even in
case we don't recognize dso, which is valid.

The 'initialized' value is used in following patch to speedup
unwind__prepare_access calls logic in fork path.
