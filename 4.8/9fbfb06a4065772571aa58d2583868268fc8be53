MIPS: KVM: Arrayify struct kvm_mips_tlb::tlb_lo*

The values of the EntryLo0 and EntryLo1 registers for a TLB entry are
stored in separate members of struct kvm_mips_tlb called tlb_lo0 and
tlb_lo1 respectively. To allow future code which needs to manipulate
arbitrary EntryLo data in the TLB entry to be simpler and less
conditional, replace these members with an array of two elements.
