reiserfs: fix "new_insert_key may be used uninitialized ..."

new_insert_key only makes any sense when it's associated with a
new_insert_ptr, which is initialized to NULL and changed to a
buffer_head when we also initialize new_insert_key.  We can key off of
that to avoid the uninitialized warning.
