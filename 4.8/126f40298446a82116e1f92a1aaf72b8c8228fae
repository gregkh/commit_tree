[media] vb2: core: Skip planes array verification if pb is NULL

An earlier patch fixing an input validation issue introduced another
issue: vb2_core_dqbuf() is called with pb argument value NULL in some
cases, causing a NULL pointer dereference. Fix this by skipping the
verification as there's nothing to verify.
