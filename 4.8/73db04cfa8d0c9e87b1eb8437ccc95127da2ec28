drm/i915: Move releasing of the GEM request from free to retire/cancel

If we move the release of the GEM request (i.e. decoupling it from the
various lists used for client and context tracking) after it is complete
(either by the GPU retiring the request, or by the caller cancelling the
request), we can remove the requirement that the final unreference of
the GEM request need to be under the struct_mutex.

The careful reader may notice that one or two impossible NULL pointer
tests are dropped for readability. These pointers cannot be NULL since
they are assigned during request construction and never unset.

v2,v3: Rebalance execlists by moving the context unpinning.
v4: Rebase onto -nightly
v5: Avoid trying to rebalance execlist/GuC context pinning, leave that
to the next step
