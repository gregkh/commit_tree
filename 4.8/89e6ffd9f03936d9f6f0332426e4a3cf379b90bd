m68k: fix bFLT executable running on MMU enabled systems

Even after recent changes to support running flat format executables on
MMU enabled systems (by nicolas.pitre@linaro.org) they still failed to
run on m68k/ColdFire MMU enabled systems. On trying to run a flat format
binary the application would immediately crash with a SIGSEGV.

Code to setup the D5 register with the base of the application data
region was only in the non-MMU code path, so it was not being set for
the MMU enabled case. Flat binaries on m68k/ColdFire use this to support
GOT/PIC flat built application code.

Fix this so that D5 is always setup when loading/running a bFLT executable
on m68k systems.
