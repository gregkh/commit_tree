xfs: stop using generic_file_read_iter for direct I/O

XFS already implement it's own flushing of the pagecache because it
implements proper synchronization for direct I/O reads.  This means
calling generic_file_read_iter for direct I/O is rather useless,
as it doesn't do much but updating the atime and iocb position for
us.  This also gets rid of the buffered I/O fallback that isn't used
for XFS.
