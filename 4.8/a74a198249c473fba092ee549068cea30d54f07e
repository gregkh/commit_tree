pwm: omap-dmtimer: Allow for setting dmtimer clock source

OMAP GP timers can have different input clocks that allow different PWM
frequencies. However, there is no other way of setting the clock source but
through clocks or clock-names properties of the timer itself. This limits
PWM functionality to only the frequencies allowed by the particular clock
source. Allowing setting the clock source by PWM rather than by timer
allows different PWMs to have different ranges by not hard-wiring the clock
source to the timer.
