KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Connect LPIs to the VGIC emulation

LPIs are dynamically created (mapped) at guest runtime and their
actual number can be quite high, but is mostly assigned using a very
sparse allocation scheme. So arrays are not an ideal data structure
to hold the information.
We use a spin-lock protected linked list to hold all mapped LPIs,
represented by their struct vgic_irq. This lock is grouped between the
ap_list_lock and the vgic_irq lock in our locking order.
Also we store a pointer to that struct vgic_irq in our struct its_itte,
so we can easily access it.
Eventually we call our new vgic_get_lpi() from vgic_get_irq(), so
the VGIC code gets transparently access to LPIs.
