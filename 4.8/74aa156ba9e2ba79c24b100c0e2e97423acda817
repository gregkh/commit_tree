drm/i915/bxt: reserve space for RC6 in the the GuC WOPCM

This patch resizes the GuC WOPCM (specifically on BXT)
so that the GuC and RC6 memory spaces do not overlap.

v2:
    Made calculation of WOPCM size into a separate function,
    so that it's consistent between the firmware size-check
    and the register-programming operations [Dave Gordon].
