jbd2: move lockdep tracking to journal_s

Currently lockdep map is tracked in each journal handle. To be able to
expand lockdep support to cover also other cases where we depend on
transaction commit and where handle is not available, move lockdep map
into struct journal_s. Since this makes the lockdep map shared for all
handles, we have to use rwsem_acquire_read() for acquisitions now.
