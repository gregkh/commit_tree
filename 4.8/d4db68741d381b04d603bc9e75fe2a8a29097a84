rtc: sh: provide rtc_class_ops directly

The rtc-generic driver provides an architecture specific
wrapper on top of the generic rtc_class_ops abstraction,
and on sh, that goes through another indirection using
the rtc_sh_get_time/rtc_sh_set_time functions.

This changes the sh rtc-generic device to provide its
rtc_class_ops directly, skipping one of the abstraction
levels.
