staging/android: sync_debug: unproxify debugfs files' fops

Since commit 49d200deaa68 ("debugfs: prevent access to removed files'
private data"), a debugfs file's file_operations methods get proxied
through lifetime aware wrappers.

However, only a certain subset of the file_operations members is supported
by debugfs and ->compat_ioctl isn't among them -- it appears to be NULL
from the VFS layer's perspective.

This behaviour breaks the /sys/kernel/debug/sync/sw_sync file introduced
concurrently with commit a44eb74cd413 ("staging/android: move SW_SYNC_USER
to a debugfs file").

Since that file never gets removed, there is no file removal race and thus,
a lifetime checking proxy isn't needed.

Avoid the proxying for /sys/kernel/debug/sync/sw_sync by creating it via
debugfs_create_file_unsafe() rather than debugfs_create_file().
For consistency, do the same for /sys/kernel/debug/sync/info.
