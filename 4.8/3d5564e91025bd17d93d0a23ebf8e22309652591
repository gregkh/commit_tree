drm/i915: Only apply one barrier after a breadcrumb interrupt is posted

If we flag the seqno as potentially stale upon receiving an interrupt,
we can use that information to reduce the frequency that we apply the
heavyweight coherent seqno read (i.e. if we wake up a chain of waiters).

v2: Use cmpxchg to replace READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE for more explicit
control of the ordering wrt to interrupt generation and interrupt
checking in the bottom-half.
