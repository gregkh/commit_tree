perf evlist: Don't poll and mmap overwritable events

There's no need to receive events from overwritable ring buffer.
Instead, perf should make them run in background until some external
event of interest takes place.  This patch makes ignores normal events from
overwrite evlists.

Overwritable events must be mapped readonly and backward, so if evlist
and evsel doesn't match (evsel->overwrite is true but either evlist is
read/write or evlist is not backward, and vice versa), skip mapping it.
