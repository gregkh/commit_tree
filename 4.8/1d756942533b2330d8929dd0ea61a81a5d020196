MIPS: KVM: Set CP0_Status.KX on MIPS64

Update the KVM entry code to set the CP0_Entry.KX bit on 64-bit kernels.
This is important to allow the entry code, running in kernel mode, to
access the full 64-bit address space right up to the point of entering
the guest, and immediately after exiting the guest, so it can safely
restore & save the guest context from 64-bit segments.
