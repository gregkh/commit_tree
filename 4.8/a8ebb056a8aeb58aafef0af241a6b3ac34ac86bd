block, drivers, cgroup: use op_is_write helper instead of checking for REQ_WRITE

We currently set REQ_WRITE/WRITE for all non READ IOs
like discard, flush, writesame, etc. In the next patches where we
no longer set up the op as a bitmap, we will not be able to
detect a operation direction like writesame by testing if REQ_WRITE is
set.

This patch converts the drivers and cgroup to use the
op_is_write helper. This should just cover the simple
cases. I did dm, md and bcache in their own patches
because they were more involved.
