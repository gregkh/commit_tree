mm: memcontrol: fix swap counter leak on swapout from offline cgroup

An offline memory cgroup might have anonymous memory or shmem left
charged to it and no swap.  Since only swap entries pin the id of an
offline cgroup, such a cgroup will have no id and so an attempt to
swapout its anon/shmem will not store memory cgroup info in the swap
cgroup map.  As a result, memcg->swap or memcg->memsw will never get
uncharged from it and any of its ascendants.

Fix this by always charging swapout to the first ancestor cgroup that
hasn't released its id yet.
