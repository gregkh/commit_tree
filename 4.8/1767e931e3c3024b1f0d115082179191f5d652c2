x86/kvm: Audit and remove any unnecessary uses of module.h

Historically a lot of these existed because we did not have
a distinction between what was modular code and what was providing
support to modules via EXPORT_SYMBOL and friends.  That changed
when we forked out support for the latter into the export.h file.

This means we should be able to reduce the usage of module.h
in code that is obj-y Makefile or bool Kconfig.  In the case of
kvm where it is modular, we can extend that to also include files
that are building basic support functionality but not related
to loading or registering the final module; such files also have
no need whatsoever for module.h

The advantage in removing such instances is that module.h itself
sources about 15 other headers; adding significantly to what we feed
cpp, and it can obscure what headers we are effectively using.

Since module.h was the source for init.h (for __init) and for
export.h (for EXPORT_SYMBOL) we consider each instance for the
presence of either and replace as needed.

Several instances got replaced with moduleparam.h since that was
really all that was required for those particular files.
