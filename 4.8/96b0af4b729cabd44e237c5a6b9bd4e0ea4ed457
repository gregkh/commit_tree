documentation: drivers/core/of: fix name of of_node symlink

commit 5590f3196b29 ("drivers/core/of: Add symlink to device-tree from
devices with an OF node") added a symlink called "of_node" to sysfs
however the documentation describes it as "of_path".

Fix the documentation to match what the code actually does.
