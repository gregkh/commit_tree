x86/PCI/VMD: Use untracked irq handler

There is no way to know which device in a VMD triggered an interrupt
without invoking every registered driver's actions. This uses the
untracked irq handler so that a less used device does not trigger
spurious interrupt.

We have been previously recommending users to enable "noirqdebug", but do
not want to force a system setting just to keep this domain functional.
