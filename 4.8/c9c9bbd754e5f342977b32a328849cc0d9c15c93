drm/amdgpu: Don't leak runtime pm ref on driver load

If an error occurs in amdgpu_device_init() after adev->rmmio has been
set, its caller amdgpu_driver_load_kms() will skip runtime pm
initialization and call amdgpu_driver_unload_kms(), which acquires a
runtime pm ref that is leaked.

Balance by releasing a runtime pm ref in the error path of
amdgpu_driver_load_kms().
