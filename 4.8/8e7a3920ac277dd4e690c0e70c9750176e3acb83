bpf, perf: split bpf_perf_event_output

Split the bpf_perf_event_output() helper as a preparation into
two parts. The new bpf_perf_event_output() will prepare the raw
record itself and test for unknown flags from BPF trace context,
where the __bpf_perf_event_output() does the core work. The
latter will be reused later on from bpf_event_output() directly.
