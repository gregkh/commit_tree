ACPI / button: Add quirks for initial lid state notification

Linux userspace (systemd-logind) keeps on rechecking lid state when the
lid state is closed. If it failed to update the lid state to open after
boot/resume, the system suspending right after the boot/resume could be
resulted.

Graphics drivers also use the lid notifications to implment
MODESET_ON_LID_OPEN option.

Before the situation is improved from the userspace and from the graphics
driver, users can simply configure ACPI button driver to send initial
"open" lid state using button.lid_init_state=open to avoid such kind of
issues.

And our ultimate target should be making button.lid_init_state=ignore
the default behavior.  This patch implements the 2 options and keep the
old behavior (button.lid_init_state=method).
