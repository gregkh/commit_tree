PM / hibernate: Restore processor state before using per-CPU variables

Restore the processor state before calling any other functions to
ensure per-CPU variables can be used with KASLR memory randomization.

Tracing functions use per-CPU variables (GS based on x86) and one was
called just before restoring the processor state fully. It resulted
in a double fault when both the tracing & the exception handler
functions tried to use a per-CPU variable.

Fixes: bb3632c6101b (PM / sleep: trace events for suspend/resume)
