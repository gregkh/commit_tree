tpm: drop 'irq' from struct tpm_vendor_specific

Dropped the field 'irq' from struct tpm_vendor_specific and make it
available to the various private structures in the drivers using irqs.

A dedicated flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_IRQ is added for the upper layers.

In st33zp24, struct st33zp24_dev declaration is moved to st33zp24.h in
order to make accessible irq from other phy's(i2c, spi).

In tpm_i2c_nuvoton, chip->vendor.priv is not directly allocated. We can
access irq field from priv_data in a cleaner way.
