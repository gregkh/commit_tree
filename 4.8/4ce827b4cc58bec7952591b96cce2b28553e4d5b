x86/power/64: Fix hibernation return address corruption

In kernel bug 150021, a kernel panic was reported when restoring a
hibernate image.  Only a picture of the oops was reported, so I can't
paste the whole thing here.  But here are the most interesting parts:

  kernel tried to execute NX-protected page - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)
  BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff8804615cfd78
  ...
  RIP: ffff8804615cfd78
  RSP: ffff8804615f0000
  RBP: ffff8804615cfdc0
  ...
  Call Trace:
   do_signal+0x23
   exit_to_usermode_loop+0x64
   ...

The RIP is on the same page as RBP, so it apparently started executing
on the stack.

The bug was bisected to commit ef0f3ed5a4ac (x86/asm/power: Create
stack frames in hibernate_asm_64.S), which in retrospect seems quite
dangerous, since that code saves and restores the stack pointer from a
global variable ('saved_context').

There are a lot of moving parts in the hibernate save and restore paths,
so I don't know exactly what caused the panic.  Presumably, a FRAME_END
was executed without the corresponding FRAME_BEGIN, or vice versa.  That
would corrupt the return address on the stack and would be consistent
with the details of the above panic.

[ rjw: One major problem is that by the time the FRAME_BEGIN in
  restore_registers() is executed, the stack pointer value may not
  be valid any more.  Namely, the stack area pointed to by it
  previously may have been overwritten by some image memory contents
  and that page frame may now be used for whatever different purpose
  it had been allocated for before hibernation.  In that case, the
  FRAME_BEGIN will corrupt that memory. ]

Instead of doing the frame pointer save/restore around the bounds of the
affected functions, just do it around the call to swsusp_save().

That has the same effect of ensuring that if swsusp_save() sleeps, the
frame pointers will be correct.  It's also a much more obviously safe
way to do it than the original patch.  And objtool still doesn't report
any warnings.
