drm/i915: Fix comments about GMBUSFREQ register

The comment about GMBUSFREQ is confused. The spec actually explains
the 4MHz thing perfectly by noting that the 4MHz divider values is
actually just bits [9:2] not [9:0], hence the divide by 1000 correct.
Replace the confused note with a quote from the spec, and eliminate
the duplicated comment that snuck in.
