powerpc/mm: Fix build break when PPC_NATIVE=n

The recent commit to rework the hash MMU setup broke the build when
CONFIG_PPC_NATIVE=n. Fix it by adding an IS_ENABLED() check before
calling hpte_init_native().

Removing the else clause opens the possibility that we don't set any
ops, which would probably lead to a strange crash later. So add a check
that we correctly initialised at least one member of the struct.
