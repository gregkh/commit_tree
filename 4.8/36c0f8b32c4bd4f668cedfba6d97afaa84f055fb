[media] vb2: replace void *alloc_ctxs by struct device *alloc_devs

Make this a proper typed array. Drop the old allocate context code since
that is no longer used.

Note that the memops functions now get a struct device pointer instead of
the struct device ** that was there initially (actually a void pointer to
a struct containing only a struct device pointer).

This code is now a lot cleaner.
