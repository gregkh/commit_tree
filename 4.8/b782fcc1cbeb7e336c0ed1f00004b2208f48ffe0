cifs: unbreak TCP session reuse

adfeb3e0 ("cifs: Make echo interval tunable") added a comparison of
vol->echo_interval to server->echo_interval as a criterium to
match_server(), but:

 (1) A default value is set for server->echo_interval but not for
 vol->echo_interval, meaning these can never match if the echo_interval
 option is not specified.

 (2) vol->echo_interval is in seconds but server->echo_interval is in
 jiffies, meaning these can never match even if the echo_interval option
 is specified.

This broke TCP session reuse since match_server() can never return 1.
Fix it.
