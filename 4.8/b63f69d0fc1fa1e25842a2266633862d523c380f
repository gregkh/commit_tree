can: mcp251x: add message about sucessful/unsuccessful probe

Silent ignorance of errors during probe procedure is a bad thing, this
patch fixes it. Extra message added for hardware initialization
failure. Such common issues are mostly caused by wrong wiring.  Message
about success added as well, it should be useful to debug new hardware
configuration, especially in case of several CAN buses.
