IB/hfi1: Separate tracepoints into specific headers

The ftrace infrastructure used to evaluate the TRACE_SYSTEM
macro on every DEFINE_EVENT() macro. Now the TRACE_SYSTEM
macro only gets evaluated when trace/define_trace.h is
included, so the group event information is lost. This was
introduced in
commit acd388fd3af3 ("tracing: Give system name a pointer")
Therefore, each system tracepoint must be on its own file.
