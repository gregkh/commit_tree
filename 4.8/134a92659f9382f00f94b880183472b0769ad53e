usbip: don't call stub_device_reset() during stub_disconnect()

stub_disconnect() calls stub_device_reset() during usb_unbind_device() when
usb device is locked. So usb_lock_device_for_reset() in stub_device_reset()
in that case polls for one second and returns -EBUSY anyway.

Remove useless flag USBIP_EH_RESET from SDEV_EVENT_REMOVED.
