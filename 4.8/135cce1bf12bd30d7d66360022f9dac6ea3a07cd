perf annotate: Add number of samples to the header

Staring at annotations of large functions is useless if there's only a
few samples in them. Report the number of samples in the header to make
this easier to determine.

Committer note:

The change amounts to:

  - Percent | Source code & Disassembly of perf-vdso.so for cycles:u
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  + Percent | Source code & Disassembly of perf-vdso.so for cycles:u (3278 samples)
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
