qed: Relax VF firmware requirements

Current driver require an exact match between VF and PF storm firmware;
Any difference would fail the VF acquire message, causing the VF probe
to be aborted.

While there's still dependencies between the two, the recent FW submission
has relaxed the match requirement - instead of an exact match, there's now
a 'fastpath' HSI major/minor scheme, where VFs and PFs that match in their
major number can co-exist even if their minor is different.

In order to accomadate this change some changes in the vf-start init flow
had to be made, as the VF start ramrod now has to be sent only after PF
learns which fastpath HSI its VF is requiring.
