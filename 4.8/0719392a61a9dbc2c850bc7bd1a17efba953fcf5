ARM: kexec: fix kexec for Keystone 2

Provide kexec with the boot view of memory by overriding the normal
kexec translation functions added in a previous patch.  We also need to
fix a call to memblock in machine_kexec_prepare() so that we provide it
with a running-view physical address rather than a boot- view physical
address.
