xfs: kill ioflags

Now that we have the direct I/O kiocb flag there is no real need to sample
the value inside of XFS, and the invis flag was always just partially used
and isn't worth keeping this infrastructure around for.   This also splits
the read tracepoint into buffered vs direct as we've done for writes a long
time ago.
