xfs: don't update rmapbt when fixing agfl

Allow a caller of xfs_alloc_fix_freelist to disable rmapbt updates
when fixing the AG freelist.  xfs_repair needs this during phase 5
to be able to adjust the freelist while it's reconstructing the rmap
btree; the missing entries will be added back at the very end of
phase 5 once the AGFL contents settle down.
