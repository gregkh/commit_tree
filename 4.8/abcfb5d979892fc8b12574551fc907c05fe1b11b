jbd2: make journal y2038 safe

The jbd2 journal stores the commit time in 64-bit seconds and 32-bit
nanoseconds, which avoids an overflow in 2038, but it gets the numbers
from current_kernel_time(), which uses 'long' seconds on 32-bit
architectures.

This simply changes the code to call current_kernel_time64() so
we use 64-bit seconds consistently.
