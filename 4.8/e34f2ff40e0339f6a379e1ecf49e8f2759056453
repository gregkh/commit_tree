ath9k: bring back direction setting in ath9k_{start_stop}

A regression was introduced in commit id 79d4db1214a ("ath9k: cleanup
led_pin initial") that broken the WLAN status led on my laptop with
AR9287 after suspending and resuming.

Steps to reproduce:
* Suspend (laptop)
* Resume (laptop)
* Observe that the WLAN led no longer turns ON/OFF depending on the
  status and is always red

Even though for my case it only needs to be set to OUT in ath9k_start
but for consistency bring back the IN direction setting as well.
