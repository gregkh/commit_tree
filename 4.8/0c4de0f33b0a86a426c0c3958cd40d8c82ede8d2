block: ensure bios return from blk_get_request are properly initialized

blk_get_request is used for BLOCK_PC and similar passthrough requests.
Currently we always need to call blk_rq_set_block_pc or an open coded
version of it to allow appending bios using the request mapping helpers
later on, which is a somewhat awkward API.  Instead move the
initialization part of blk_rq_set_block_pc into blk_get_request, so that
we always have a safe to use request.
