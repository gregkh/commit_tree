bpf: add XDP prog type for early driver filter

Add a new bpf prog type that is intended to run in early stages of the
packet rx path. Only minimal packet metadata will be available, hence a
new context type, struct xdp_md, is exposed to userspace. So far only
expose the packet start and end pointers, and only in read mode.

An XDP program must return one of the well known enum values, all other
return codes are reserved for future use. Unfortunately, this
restriction is hard to enforce at verification time, so take the
approach of warning at runtime when such programs are encountered. Out
of bounds return codes should alias to XDP_ABORTED.
