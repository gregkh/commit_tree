mm: move most file-based accounting to the node

There are now a number of accounting oddities such as mapped file pages
being accounted for on the node while the total number of file pages are
accounted on the zone.  This can be coped with to some extent but it's
confusing so this patch moves the relevant file-based accounted.  Due to
throttling logic in the page allocator for reliable OOM detection, it is
still necessary to track dirty and writeback pages on a per-zone basis.
