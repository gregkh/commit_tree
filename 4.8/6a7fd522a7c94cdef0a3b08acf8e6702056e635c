ext4: don't call ext4_should_journal_data() on the journal inode

If ext4_fill_super() fails early, it's possible for ext4_evict_inode()
to call ext4_should_journal_data() before superblock options and flags
are fully set up.  In that case, the iput() on the journal inode can
end up causing a BUG().

Work around this problem by reordering the tests so we only call
ext4_should_journal_data() after we know it's not the journal inode.
