KVM: s390: interface to query and configure cpu subfunctions

We have certain instructions that indicate available subfunctions via
a query subfunction (crypto functions and ptff), or via a test bit
function (plo).

By exposing these "subfunction blocks" to user space, we allow user space
to
1) query available subfunctions and make sure subfunctions won't get lost
   during migration - e.g. properly indicate them via a CPU model
2) change the subfunctions to be reported to the guest (even adding
   unavailable ones)

This mechanism works just like the way we indicate the stfl(e) list to
user space.

This way, user space could even emulate some subfunctions in QEMU in the
future. If this is ever applicable, we have to make sure later on, that
unsupported subfunctions result in an intercept to QEMU.

Please note that support to indicate them to the guest is still missing
and requires hardware support. Usually, the IBC takes already care of these
subfunctions for migration safety. QEMU should make sure to always set
these bits properly according to the machine generation to be emulated.

Available subfunctions are only valid in combination with STFLE bits
retrieved via KVM_S390_VM_CPU_MACHINE and enabled via
KVM_S390_VM_CPU_PROCESSOR. If the applicable bits are available, the
indicated subfunctions are guaranteed to be correct.
