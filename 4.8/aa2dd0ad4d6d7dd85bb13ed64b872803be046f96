xfs: remove __arch_pack

Instead we always declare struct xfs_dir2_sf_hdr as packed.  That's
the expected layout, and while most major architectures do the packing
by default the new structure size and offset checker showed that not
only the ARM old ABI got this wrong, but various minor embedded
architectures did as well.

[Verified that no code change on x86-64 results from this change]
