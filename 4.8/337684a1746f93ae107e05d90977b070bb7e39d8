fs: return EPERM on immutable inode

In most cases, EPERM is returned on immutable inode, and there're only a
few places returning EACCES. I noticed this when running LTP on
overlayfs, setxattr03 failed due to unexpected EACCES on immutable
inode.

So converting all EACCES to EPERM on immutable inode.
