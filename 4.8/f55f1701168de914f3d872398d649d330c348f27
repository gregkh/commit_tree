drm/atomic-helper: Do not call ->mode_fixup for CRTC which will be disabled

When a CRTC is going to be disabled, it's state may contain a display mode
with zeroed content.  This could be reproduced by HDMI cable hotplug out
operation with legacy fbdev support in dual display cases.  It would confuse
driver's CRTC callback ->mode_fixup and make the total state be rejected.
So, let's don't call the callback for the CRTC.
