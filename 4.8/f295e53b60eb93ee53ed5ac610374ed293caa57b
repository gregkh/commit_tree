libnvdimm, pmem: allow nfit_test to override pmem_direct_access()

Currently phys_to_pfn_t() is an exported symbol to allow nfit_test to
override it and indicate that nfit_test-pmem is not device-mapped.  Now,
we want to enable nfit_test to operate without DMA_CMA and the pmem it
provides will no longer be physically contiguous, i.e. won't be capable
of supporting direct_access requests larger than a page.  Make
pmem_direct_access() a weak symbol so that it can be replaced by the
tools/testing/nvdimm/ version, and move phys_to_pfn_t() to a static
inline now that it no longer needs to be overridden.
