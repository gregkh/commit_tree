IB/rxe: Fix race condition between requester and completer

rxe_requester() is sending a pkt with rxe_xmit_packet() and
then calls rxe_update() to update the wqe and qp's psn values.
But sometimes the response is received before the requester
had time to update the wqe in which case the completer
acts on errornous wqe values.
This fix updates the wqe and qp before actually sending
the request and rolls back when xmit fails.
