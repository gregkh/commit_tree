Documentation/sphinx: configure the kernel-doc extension

Tell Sphinx where to find the extension, and pass on the kernel src tree
and kernel-doc paths to the extension.

With this, any .rst files under Documentation may contain the kernel-doc
rst directive to include kernel-doc documentation from any source file.

While building, it may be handy to pass kernel-doc extension
configuration on the command line. For example, 'make SPHINXOPTS="-D
kerneldoc_verbosity=0" htmldocs' silences all stderr output from
kernel-doc when the kernel-doc exit code is 0. (The stderr will be
logged unconditionally when the exit code is non-zero.)
