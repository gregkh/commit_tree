arm64: mm: dump: make page table dumping reusable

For debugging purposes, it would be nice if we could export page tables
other than the swapper_pg_dir to userspace. To enable this, this patch
refactors the arm64 page table dumping code such that multiple tables
may be registered with the framework, and exported under debugfs.
