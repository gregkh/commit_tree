net_sched: remove generic throttled management

__QDISC_STATE_THROTTLED bit manipulation is rather expensive
for HTB and few others.

I already removed it for sch_fq in commit f2600cf02b5b
("net: sched: avoid costly atomic operation in fq_dequeue()")
and so far nobody complained.

When one ore more packets are stuck in one or more throttled
HTB class, a htb dequeue() performs two atomic operations
to clear/set __QDISC_STATE_THROTTLED bit, while root qdisc
lock is held.

Removing this pair of atomic operations bring me a 8 % performance
increase on 200 TCP_RR tests, in presence of throttled classes.

This patch has no side effect, since nothing actually uses
disc_is_throttled() anymore.
