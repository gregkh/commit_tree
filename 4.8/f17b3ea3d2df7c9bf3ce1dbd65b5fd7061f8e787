Revert "drm/fb-helper: Reduce READ_ONCE(master) to lockless_dereference"

This reverts commit:

  fa7d81bb3c269 ("drm/fb-helper: Reduce READ_ONCE(master) to lockless_dereference")

As Peter explained:

  [...] lockless_dereference() is _stronger_ than READ_ONCE(), not weaker.

  [...]

  Also, clue is in the name: 'dereference', you don't actually dereference
  the pointer here, only load it.

My next patch breaks the compile without this revert, because it assumes
you want to deference and thus also need the struct type visible (which
it isn't here), so revert it.
