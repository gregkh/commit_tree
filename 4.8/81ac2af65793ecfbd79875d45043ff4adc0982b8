mmc: core: implement enhanced strobe support

Controllers use data strobe line to latch data from devices
under hs400 mode, but not for cmd line. So since emmc 5.1, JEDEC
introduces enhanced strobe mode for latching cmd response from
emmc devices to host controllers. This new feature is optional,
so it depends both on device's cap and host's cap to decide
whether to use it or not.
