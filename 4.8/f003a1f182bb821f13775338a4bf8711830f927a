lib/iommu-helper: skip to next segment

When a large enough area in the iommu bitmap is found but would span a
boundary we continue the search starting from the next bit position.
For large allocations this can lead to several useless invocations of
bitmap_find_next_zero_area() and iommu_is_span_boundary().

Continue the search from the start of the next segment (which is the
next bit position such that we'll not cross the same segment boundary
again).
