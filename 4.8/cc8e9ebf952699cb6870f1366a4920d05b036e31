net/mlx5e: Fix ethtool -g/G rx ring parameter report with striding RQ

The driver RQ has two possible configurations: striding RQ and
non-striding RQ.  Until this patch, the driver always reported the
number of hardware WQEs (ring descriptors). For non striding RQ
configuration, this was OK since we have one WQE per pending packet
For striding RQ, multiple packets can fit into one WQE. For better
user experience we normalize the rx_pending parameter (size of wqe/mtu)
as the average ring size in case of striding RQ.
