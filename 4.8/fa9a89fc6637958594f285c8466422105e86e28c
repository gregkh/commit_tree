nvme: initialize variable before logical OR'ing it

It is typically not good coding or secure coding practice
to logical OR a variable without an initialization value first.
Here on this line:

integrity.flags |= BLK_INTEGRITY_DEVICE_CAPABLE;

BLK_INTEGRITY_DEVICE_CAPABLE is being OR'ed to a member variable
never set to an initial value. This patch fixes that.
