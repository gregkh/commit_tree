powerpc: Send SIGBUS on unaligned copy and paste

Calling ISA 3.0 instructions copy, copy_first, paste and paste_last
generates an alignment fault when copying or pasting unaligned
data (128 byte). We catch this and send SIGBUS to the userspace
process that caused it.

We do not emulate these because paste may contain additional metadata
when pasting to a co-processor and paste_last is the synchronisation
point for preceding copy/paste sequences.
