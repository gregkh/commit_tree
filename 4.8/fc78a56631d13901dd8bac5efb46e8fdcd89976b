pinctrl: uniphier: allocate struct pinctrl_desc in probe function

Currently, every SoC driver defines struct pinctrl_desc statically,
i.e. it consumes memory footprint even if it is not probed.

In multi-platform, many pinctrl drivers are linked (generally as
built-in objects), although only one of them is actually used.
So, it is reasonable to allocate memory dynamically where possible.
