bnxt_en: Improve ntuple filters by checking destination MAC address.

Include the destination MAC address in the ntuple filter structure.  The
current code assumes that the destination MAC address is always the MAC
address of the NIC.  This may not be true if there are macvlans, for
example.  Add destination MAC address checking and configure the filter
correctly using the correct index for the destination MAC address.
