rxrpc: fix uninitialized variable use

Hashing the peer key was introduced for AF_INET, but gcc
warns about the rxrpc_peer_hash_key function returning uninitialized
data for any other value of srx->transport.family:

net/rxrpc/peer_object.c: In function 'rxrpc_peer_hash_key':
net/rxrpc/peer_object.c:57:15: error: 'p' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Assuming that nothing else can be set here, this changes the
function to just return zero in case of an unknown address
family.
