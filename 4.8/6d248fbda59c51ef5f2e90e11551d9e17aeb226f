tools lib traceevent: Add filter on task CPU id

Add a 'CPU' special field to allow the filter in trace-cmd report to
filter on the task's CPU.

By adding a special field 'CPU' (all caps) the user can now filter out
tasks based on which CPU they are on. This is useful when filtering out
(or in) a bunch of threads.

  -F 'CPU == 0'
