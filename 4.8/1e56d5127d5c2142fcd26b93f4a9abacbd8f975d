ath10k: fix diag_read to collect data for larger memory

diag_read uses dma_alloc_coherent to allocate memory requested by the
caller. If this memory requested is larger, more than DIAG_TRANSFER_LIMIT
(2K), then it is likely that we may not get the requested memory and we
would fail.

To solve this, request dma_alloc_coherent for only DIAG_TRANSFER_LIMIT, and
reuse this buffer multiple times as needed to copy the data requested in
smaller chunks of size not more than DIAG_TRANSFER_LIMIT. Previously we
were reading into the caller's only after getting the complete requested
data.
