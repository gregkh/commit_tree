f2fs: fix to detect truncation prior rather than EIO during read

In procedure of synchonized read, after sending out the read request, reader
will try to lock the page for waiting device to finish the read jobs and
unlock the page, but meanwhile, truncater will race with reader, so after
reader get lock of the page, it should check page's mapping to detect
whether someone has truncated the page in advance, then reader has the
chance to do the retry if truncation was done, otherwise read can be failed
due to previous condition check.
