tools lib traceevent: Add correct header for ipv6 definitions

We need to include netinet/in.h to get the in6_addr struct definition, needed to
build it on the Android NDK:

  In file included from event-parse.c:36:0:
  /home/acme/android/android-ndk-r12/platforms/android-24/arch-arm/usr/include/netinet/ip6.h:82:18: error: field 'ip6_src' has incomplete type
    struct in6_addr ip6_src; /* source address */

And it is the canonical way of getting IPv6 definitions, as described,
for instance, in Linux's 'man ipv6'

Doing that uncovers another problem: this source file uses PRIu64 but
doesn't include it, depending on it being included by chance via the now
replaced header (netinet/ip6.h), fix it.
