NTB: allocate number transport entries depending on size of ring size

Currently we only allocate a fixed default number of descriptors for the tx
and rx side. We should dynamically resize it to the number of descriptors
resides in the transport rings. We should know the number of transmit
descriptors at initializaiton. We will allocate the default number of
descriptors for receive side and allocate additional ones when we know the
actual max entries for receive.
