x86/vdso/32: Assemble sigreturn.S separately

sigreturn.S was historically included by the various
__kernel_vsyscall implementations due to assumptions about all the
32-bit vDSO images having the sigreturn symbols at the same address.

Those assumptions were removed in v3.16, and as of v4.4, there is only
a single 32-bit vDSO left.

Simplify the build process by assembling sigreturn.S into a normal
object file.
