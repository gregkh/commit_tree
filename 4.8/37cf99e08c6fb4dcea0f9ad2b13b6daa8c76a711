balloon: check the number of available pages in leak balloon

The balloon has a special mechanism that is subscribed to the oom
notification which leads to deflation for a fixed number of pages.
The number is always fixed even when the balloon is fully deflated.
But leak_balloon did not expect that the pages to deflate will be more
than taken, and raise a "BUG" in balloon_page_dequeue when page list
will be empty.

So, the simplest solution would be to check that the number of releases
pages is less or equal to the number taken pages.
