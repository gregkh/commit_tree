qed: PF to reply to unknown messages

If a future VF would send the PF an unknown message, the PF today would
not send a reply. This would have 2 bad effects:
  a. VF would have to timeout on the request.
  b. If VF were to send an additional message to PF, firmware would mark
     it as malicious.

Instead, if there's some valid reply-address on the message - let the PF
answer and tell the VF it doesn't know the message.
