iio: pressure: bmp280: split off an I2C Kconfig entry

This creates a separate BMP280_I2C Kconfig entry that gets selected
by BMP280 for I2C transport. As we currently only support I2C
transport there is not much practical change other than getting
a separate object file (or module) for the I2C driver part. The
old Kconfig symbol BMP280 will still select the stuff we need so
that oldconfig and old defconfigs works fine.
