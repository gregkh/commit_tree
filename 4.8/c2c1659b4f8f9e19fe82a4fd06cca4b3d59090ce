serial: mvebu-uart: free the IRQ in ->shutdown()

As suggested by the serial port infrastructure documentation, the IRQ is
requested in ->startup(). However, it is never freed in the ->shutdown()
hook.

With simple systems that open the serial port once for all and always
have at least one process that keep the serial port opened, there was no
problem. But with a more complicated system (*cough* systemd *cough*),
the serial port is opened/closed many times, which at some point no
processes having the serial port open at all. Due to this ->startup()
gets called again, tries to request_irq() again, which fails.
