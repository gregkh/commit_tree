crypto: tcrypt - Fix mixing printk/pr_err and obvious indentation issues

The recently added test_mb_ahash_speed() has clearly serious coding
style issues. Try to fix some of them:
1. Don't mix pr_err() and printk();
2. Don't wrap strings;
3. Properly align goto statement in if() block;
4. Align wrapped arguments on new line;
5. Don't wrap functions on first argument;
