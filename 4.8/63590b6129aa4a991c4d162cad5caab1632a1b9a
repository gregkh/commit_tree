i40evf: always activate correct MAC address filter

Always add MAC address at the tail of the MAC filter list. Since the
device's "real" MAC address is added first, it will always be at the
beginning of the list. This prevents an issue where the "real" MAC
filter might not get added if too many other filters are added before
bringing the interface up.
