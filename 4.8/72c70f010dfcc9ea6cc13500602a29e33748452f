MIPS: Stop setting I6400 FTLBP

The FTLBP field in Config7 for the I6400 is intended as chicken bits for
debugging rather than as a field that software actually makes use of.
For best performance, FTLBP should be left at its default value of 0
with all TLB writes hitting the FTLB by default.

Additionally, since set_ftlb_enable is called from decode_configs before
decode_config4 which determines the size of the TLBs, this was
previously always setting FTLBP=3 for a 3:1 FTLB:VTLB write ratio which
makes abysmal use of the available FTLB resources.

This effectively reverts b0c4e1b79d8a ("MIPS: Set up FTLB probability
for I6400").
