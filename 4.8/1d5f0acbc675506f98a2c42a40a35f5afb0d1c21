proc, oom_adj: extract oom_score_adj setting into a helper

Currently we have two proc interfaces to set oom_score_adj.  The legacy
/proc/<pid>/oom_adj and /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj which both have their
specific handlers.  Big part of the logic is duplicated so extract the
common code into __set_oom_adj helper.  Legacy knob still expects some
details slightly different so make sure those are handled same way - e.g.
the legacy mode ignores oom_score_adj_min and it warns about the usage.

This patch shouldn't introduce any functional changes.
