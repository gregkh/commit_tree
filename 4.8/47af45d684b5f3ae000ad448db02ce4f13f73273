Input: i8042 - set up shared ps2_cmd_mutex for AUX ports

The commit 4097461897df ("Input: i8042 - break load dependency ...")
correctly set up ps2_cmd_mutex pointer for the KBD port but forgot to do
the same for AUX port(s), which results in communication on KBD and AUX
ports to clash with each other.
