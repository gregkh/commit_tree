skbuff: introduce skb_gso_validate_mtu

skb_gso_network_seglen is not enough for checking fragment sizes if
skb is using GSO_BY_FRAGS as we have to check frag per frag.

This patch introduces skb_gso_validate_mtu, based on the former, which
will wrap the use case inside it as all calls to skb_gso_network_seglen
were to validate if it fits on a given TMU, and improve the check.
