clk: sunxi-ng: Fix inverted test condition in ccu_helper_wait_for_lock

The condition passed to read*_poll_timeout() is the break condition,
i.e. wait for this condition to happen and return success.

The original code assumed the opposite, resulting in a warning when
the PLL clock rate was changed but never lost it's lock as far as
the readout indicated. This was verified by checking the read out
register value.
