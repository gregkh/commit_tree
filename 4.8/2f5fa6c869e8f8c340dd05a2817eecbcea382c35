hv_netvsc: pass struct netvsc_device to rndis_filter_{open, close}()

Both rndis_filter_open()/rndis_filter_close() use struct hv_device to
reach to struct netvsc_device only and all callers have it already.
While on it, rename net_device to nvdev in rndis_filter_open() as
net_device is misleading.
