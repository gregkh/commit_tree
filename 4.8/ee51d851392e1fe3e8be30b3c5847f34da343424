perf annotate: Introduce strerror for handling symbol__disassemble() errors

We were just using pr_error() which makes it difficult for non stdio UIs
to provide errors using its widgets, as they need to somehow catch what
was passed to pr_error().

Fix it by introducing a __strerror() interface like the ones used
elsewhere, for instance target__strerror().

This is just the initial step, more work will be done, but first some
error handling bugs noticed while working on this need to be dealt with.
