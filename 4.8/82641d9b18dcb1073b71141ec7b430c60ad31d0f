PCI: mvebu: Make explicitly non-modular

This code is not being built as a module by anyone:

  drivers/pci/host/Kconfig:config PCI_MVEBU
  drivers/pci/host/Kconfig:       bool "Marvell EBU PCIe controller"

Remove uses of MODULE_DESCRIPTION(), MODULE_AUTHOR(), MODULE_LICENSE(),
etc., so that when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.
The information is preserved in comments at the top of the file.

Replace module_platform_driver() with builtin_platform_driver(), which uses
the same init level priority, so init ordering is unchanged.

Note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.
