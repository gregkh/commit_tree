spi: s3c64xx: add exynos5433 spi compatible

The samsung,exynos5433-spi has some peculiarities that bring the
need of creating a new compatible in the binding.

One of those is the 3-clocks controller management where the spi
is fed with three clocks: "spi", "busclkN" and "ioclk".

By adding the exynos5433-spi, we deprecate the exynos7 compatible
and discourage its use.
