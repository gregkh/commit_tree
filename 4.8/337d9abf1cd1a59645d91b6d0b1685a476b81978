mm: thp: check pmd_trans_unstable() after split_huge_pmd()

split_huge_pmd() doesn't guarantee that the pmd is normal pmd pointing
to pte entries, which can be checked with pmd_trans_unstable().  Some
callers make this assertion and some do it differently and some not, so
let's do it in a unified manner.
