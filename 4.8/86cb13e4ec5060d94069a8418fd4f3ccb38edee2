mlxsw: spectrum: Fix compilation error when CLS_ACT isn't set

When CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT isn't set 'struct tcf_exts' has no member named
'actions' and we therefore must not access it. Otherwise compilation
fails.

Fix this by introducing a new macro similar to tc_no_actions(), which
always returns 'false' if CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT isn't set.
