powerpc: Define and use PPC64_ELF_ABI_v2/v1

We're approaching 20 locations where we need to check for ELF ABI v2.
That's fine, except the logic is a bit awkward, because we have to check
that _CALL_ELF is defined and then what its value is.

So check it once in asm/types.h and define PPC64_ELF_ABI_v2 when ELF ABI
v2 is detected.

We also have a few places where what we're really trying to check is
that we are using the 64-bit v1 ABI, ie. function descriptors. So also
add a #define for that, which simplifies several checks.
