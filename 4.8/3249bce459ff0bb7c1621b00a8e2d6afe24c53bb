bus: arm-ccn: Add missing event attribute exclusions for host/guest

CCN PMUs have no knowledge into VM-related origins of the memory
traffic, therefore can't handle requests for host-only or guest-only
events.

Added appropriate exclusions (they should have been there from the
beginning). This required changing the error code returned, as the
userspace tool only re-negotiates the options (exclude_guest is true by
default) only for EINVAL.
