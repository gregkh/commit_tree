mnt: Move the FS_USERNS_MOUNT check into sget_userns

Allowing a filesystem to be mounted by other than root in the initial
user namespace is a filesystem property not a mount namespace property
and as such should be checked in filesystem specific code.  Move the
FS_USERNS_MOUNT test into super.c:sget_userns().
