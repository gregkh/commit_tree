Revert "wext: Fix 32 bit iwpriv compatibility issue with 64 bit Kernel"

This reverts commit 3d5fdff46c4b2b9534fa2f9fc78e90a48e0ff724.

Ben Hutchings pointed out that the commit isn't safe since it assumes
that the structure used by the driver is iw_point, when in fact there's
no way to know about that.

Fortunately, the only driver in the tree that ever runs this code path
is the wilc1000 staging driver, so it doesn't really matter.

Clearly I should have investigated this better before applying, sorry.
