ntb_perf: Schedule based on time not on performance

When debugging performance problems, if some issue causes the ntb
hardware to be significantly slower than expected, ntb_perf will
hang requiring a reboot because it only schedules once every 4GB.

Instead, schedule based on jiffies so it will not hang the CPU if
the transfer is slow.
