net_sched: convert tcf_exts from list to pointer array

As pointed out by Jamal, an action could be shared by
multiple filters, so we can't use list to chain them
any more after we get rid of the original tc_action.
Instead, we could just save pointers to these actions
in tcf_exts, since they are refcount'ed, so convert
the list to an array of pointers.

The "ugly" part is the action API still accepts list
as a parameter, I just introduce a helper function to
convert the array of pointers to a list, instead of
relying on the C99 feature to iterate the array.
