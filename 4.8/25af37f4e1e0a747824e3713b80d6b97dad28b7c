x86/insn: Add AVX-512 support to the instruction decoder

Add support for Intel's AVX-512 instructions to the instruction decoder.

AVX-512 instructions are documented in Intel Architecture Instruction
Set Extensions Programming Reference (February 2016).

AVX-512 instructions are identified by a EVEX prefix which, for the
purpose of instruction decoding, can be treated as though it were a
4-byte VEX prefix.

Existing instructions which can now accept an EVEX prefix need not be
further annotated in the op code map (x86-opcode-map.txt). In the case
of new instructions, the op code map is updated accordingly.

Also add associated Mask Instructions that are used to manipulate mask
registers used in AVX-512 instructions.

The 'perf tools' instruction decoder is updated in a subsequent patch.
And a representative set of instructions is added to the perf tools new
instructions test in a subsequent patch.
