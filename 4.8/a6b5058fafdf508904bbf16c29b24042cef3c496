fs/cifs: make share unaccessible at root level mountable

if, when mounting //HOST/share/sub/dir/foo we can query /sub/dir/foo but
not any of the path components above:

- store the /sub/dir/foo prefix in the cifs super_block info
- in the superblock, set root dentry to the subpath dentry (instead of
  the share root)
- set a flag in the superblock to remember it
- use prefixpath when building path from a dentry

fixes bso#8950
