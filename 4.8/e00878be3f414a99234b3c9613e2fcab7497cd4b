cxl: make base more explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig/Makefile currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/misc/cxl/Kconfig:config CXL_BASE
drivers/misc/cxl/Kconfig:       bool

drivers/misc/cxl/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_CXL_BASE)          += base.o

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets convert the one module_init into device_initcall so that
when reading the driver it more clear that it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file is doing
other modular stuff (module_get/put) even though it is built-in.
