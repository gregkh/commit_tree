EDAC, sb_edac: Fix channel reporting on Knights Landing

On Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing processor family the channels of the
memory controller have untypical arrangement - MC0 is mapped to CH3,4,5
and MC1 is mapped to CH0,1,2. This causes the EDAC driver to report the
channel name incorrectly.

We missed this change earlier, so the code already contains similar
comment, but the translation function is incorrect.

Without this patch:
  errors in DIMM_A and DIMM_D were reported in DIMM_D
  errors in DIMM_B and DIMM_E were reported in DIMM_E
  errors in DIMM_C and DIMM_F were reported in DIMM_F

Correct this.

Hubert Chrzaniuk:
 - rebased to 4.8
 - comments and code cleanup
