xfs: remove the get*keys and update_keys btree ops pointers

These are internal btree functions; we don't need them to be
dispatched via function pointers.  Make them static again and
just check the overlapped flag to figure out what we need to
do.  The strategy behind this patch was suggested by Christoph.
