checkpatch: check signoff when reading stdin

Signoff was not checked if the filename is '-', indicating reading the
patch from stdin.  Commands such as the below would not warn about a
missing signoff, because the patch filename is '-'.  This change allows
checkpatch to warn about a missing signoff, even if the input filename
is '-', but only if the patch has a commit message.

  git show --pretty=email | scripts/checkpatch.pl -

A more common use of checkpatch with stdin is for piping git diff
through checkpatch.  The diff output would not contain a commit message,
and therefore it would not contain a signoff line.  For this common use
case, a warning should not be printed about the missing signoff.  With
this change we will only warn about a missing signoff if the input
contains a commit message.

  git diff | scripts/checkpatch.pl -

Before this patch, a workaround for the first command was to refer to
stdin by a name other than '-'.  The workaround is not an elegant
solution, because elsewhere checkpatch uses the fact that filename
equals '-', such as in setting '$vname' to 'Your patch' for stdin.  The
command below would report "/dev/stdin has style problems" instead of
"Your patch has style problems."

  git show --pretty=email | scripts/checkpatch.pl /dev/stdin
