powerpc/ptrace: Enable support for NT_PPC_CVMX

This patch enables support for TM checkpointed VMX register
set ELF core note NT_PPC_CVMX based ptrace requests through
PTRACE_GETREGSET, PTRACE_SETREGSET calls. This is achieved
through adding a register set REGSET_CVMX in powerpc
corresponding to the ELF core note section added. It
implements the get, set and active functions for this new
register set added.
