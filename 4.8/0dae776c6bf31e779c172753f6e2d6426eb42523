Add Cyclomatic complexity GCC plugin

Add a very simple plugin to demonstrate the GCC plugin infrastructure. This GCC
plugin computes the cyclomatic complexity of each function.

The complexity M of a function's control flow graph is defined as:
M = E - N + 2P
where
E = the number of edges
N = the number of nodes
P = the number of connected components (exit nodes).
