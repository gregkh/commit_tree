scsi/osd: open code blk_make_request

I wish the OSD code could simply use blk_rq_map_* helpers like
everyone else, but the complex nature of deciding if we have
DATA IN and/or DATA OUT buffers might make this impossible
(at least for a mere human like me).

But using blk_rq_append_bio at least allows sharing the setup code
between request with or without dat a buffers, and given that this
is the last user of blk_make_request it allows getting rid of that
somewhat awkward interface.
