qed: Initialize hardware for new protocols

RoCE and iSCSI would require some added/changed hw configuration in order
to properly run; The biggest single change being the requirement of
allocating and mapping host memory for several HW blocks that aren't being
used by qede [SRC, QM, TM, etc.].

In addition, whereas qede is only using context memory for HW blocks, the
new protocol would also require task memories to be added.
