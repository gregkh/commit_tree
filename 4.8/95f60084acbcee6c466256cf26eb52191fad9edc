perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix an off-by-one in address filter configuration

PT address filter configuration requires that a range is specified by
its first and last address, but at the moment we're obtaining the end
of the range by adding user specified size to its start, which is off
by one from what it actually needs to be.

Fix this and make sure that zero-sized filters don't pass the filter
validation.
