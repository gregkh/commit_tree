Documentation: mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: Add ability to export card clock

Some SD/eMMC PHYs (like the PHY from Arasan that is designed to work
with arasan,sdhci-5.1) need to know the card clock frequency in order to
function properly.  Physically in a SoC this clock is exported from the
SDHCI IP block to the PHY IP block and the PHY needs to know the speed.
Let's export the SDHCI card clock using a standard device tree mechanism
so that the PHY can get access to it and query the card clock frequency.
