x86/ptrace: run seccomp after ptrace

This moves seccomp after ptrace on x86 to that seccomp can catch changes
made by ptrace. Emulation should skip the rest of processing too.

We can get rid of test_thread_flag because there's no longer any
opportunity for seccomp to mess with ptrace state before invoking
ptrace.
