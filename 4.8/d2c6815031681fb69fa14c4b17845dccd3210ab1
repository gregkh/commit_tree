[media] doc-rst: add media.h header to media contrller

Adding the header file is interesting for several reasons:

1) It makes MC documentation consistend with other parts;
2) The header file can be used as a quick index to all API
   elements;
3) The cross-reference check helps to identify symbols that
   aren't documented.
