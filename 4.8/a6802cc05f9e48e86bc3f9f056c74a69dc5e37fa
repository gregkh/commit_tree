spi: sh-msiof: Remove sh_msiof_spi_priv.chipdata

After probe time, the pointer to the sh_msiof_chipdata structure in the
sh_msiof_spi_priv structure is used only for checking the SPI master flags.
As these are also available in the spi_master structure, convert the
users to access those, and remove the pointer.
