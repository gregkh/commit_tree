drm/i915/debugfs: Show context objects in i915_gem_objects

One of the uses for i915_gem_objects is pin-pointing leaks. For this, we
can compare the number of allocated objects and who owns them, a
discrepancy here often indicates a kernel bug. One allocator of unreported
objects is for backing context objects, so include those in the listing.

v2: Take filelist_mutex which requires a little dance with struct_mutex
to avoid nesting filelist_mutex inside struct_mutex.
