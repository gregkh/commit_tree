crypto: user - no parsing of CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG

The CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG netlink message type provides a buffer to the
kernel to retrieve information from the kernel. The data buffer will not
provide any input and will not be read. Hence the nlmsg_parse is not
applicable to this netlink message type.

This patch fixes the following kernel log message when using this
netlink interface:

netlink: 208 bytes leftover after parsing attributes in process `XXX'.

Patch successfully tested with libkcapi from [1] which uses
CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG to obtain cipher-specific information from the kernel.
