mm, oom_reaper: do not attempt to reap a task more than twice

oom_reaper relies on the mmap_sem for read to do its job.  Many places
which might block readers have been converted to use down_write_killable
and that has reduced chances of the contention a lot.  Some paths where
the mmap_sem is held for write can take other locks and they might
either be not prepared to fail due to fatal signal pending or too
impractical to be changed.

This patch introduces MMF_OOM_NOT_REAPABLE flag which gets set after the
first attempt to reap a task's mm fails.  If the flag is present after
the failure then we set MMF_OOM_REAPED to hide this mm from the oom
killer completely so it can go and chose another victim.

As a result a risk of OOM deadlock when the oom victim would be blocked
indefinetly and so the oom killer cannot make any progress should be
mitigated considerably while we still try really hard to perform all
reclaim attempts and stay predictable in the behavior.
