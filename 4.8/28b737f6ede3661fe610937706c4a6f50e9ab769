Btrfs: clarify do_chunk_alloc()'s return value

Function start_transaction() can return ERR_PTR(1) when flush is
BTRFS_RESERVE_FLUSH_LIMIT, so the call graph is

start_transaction (return ERR_PTR(1))
  -> btrfs_block_rsv_add (return 1)
     -> reserve_metadata_bytes (return 1)
        -> flush_space (return 1)
           -> do_chunk_alloc  (return 1)

With BTRFS_RESERVE_FLUSH_LIMIT, if flush_space is already on the
flush_state of ALLOC_CHUNK and it successfully allocates a new
chunk, then instead of trying to reserve space again,
reserve_metadata_bytes returns 1 immediately.

Eventually the callers who call start_transaction() usually just
do the IS_ERR() check which ERR_PTR(1) can pass, then it'll get
a panic when dereferencing a pointer which is ERR_PTR(1).

The following patch fixes the above problem.
"btrfs: flush_space: treat return value of do_chunk_alloc properly"

This add comments to clarify do_chunk_alloc()'s return value.
