ocfs2/dlm: continue to purge recovery lockres when recovery master goes down

We found a dlm-blocked situation caused by continuous breakdown of
recovery masters described below.  To solve this problem, we should
purge recovery lock once detecting recovery master goes down.

N3                      N2                   N1(reco master)
                        go down
                                             pick up recovery lock and
                                             begin recoverying for N2

                                             go down

pick up recovery
lock failed, then
purge it:
dlm_purge_lockres
  ->DROPPING_REF is set

send deref to N1 failed,
recovery lock is not purged

find N1 go down, begin
recoverying for N1, but
blocked in dlm_do_recovery
as DROPPING_REF is set:
dlm_do_recovery
  ->dlm_pick_recovery_master
    ->dlmlock
      ->dlm_get_lock_resource
        ->__dlm_wait_on_lockres_flags(tmpres,
	  	DLM_LOCK_RES_DROPPING_REF);
