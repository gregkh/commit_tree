drm/rockchip: Disarm vop->is_enabled

With atomic helpers there's no need to track the enabled state of a pipe
any more, because atomic helpers track this accurately already.

Just disable the early returns, since the debug checks might be useful.

v2: Don't call drm_helper_disable_unused_functions, it blows up
without this check. At least explains why rockchip still needed this
old legacy-style state tracing - to work around issues from calling
other legacy style functions!
