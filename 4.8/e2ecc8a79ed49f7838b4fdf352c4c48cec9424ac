mm, vmstat: print node-based stats in zoneinfo file

There are a number of stats that were previously accessible via zoneinfo
that are now invisible.  While it is possible to create a new file for
the node stats, this may be missed by users.  Instead this patch prints
the stats under the first populated zone in /proc/zoneinfo.
