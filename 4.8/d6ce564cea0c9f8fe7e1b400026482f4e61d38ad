irqchip/gic: Isolate early GIC initialisation code

To re-use the code that initialises the GIC (found in
__gic_init_bases()), from within a platform driver, it is necessary to
move the code from the __init section so that it is always present and
not removed. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply drop the __init
from the function declaration for __gic_init_bases() because it contains
calls to set_smp_cross_call() and set_handle_irq() which are both
located in the __init section. Fortunately, these calls are only
required for the root controller and because the initial platform driver
will only support non-root controllers that can be initialised later in
the boot process, we can move these calls to another function.

Move the bulk of the code from __gic_init_bases() to a new function
called gic_init_bases() which is not located in the __init section and
can be used by the platform driver. Update __gic_init_bases() to call
gic_init_bases() and if necessary, set_smp_cross_call() and
set_handle_irq().
