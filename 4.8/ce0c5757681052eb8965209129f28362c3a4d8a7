drm/fb_cma_helper: Implement fb_mmap callback

In the absence of an fb_mmap callback, the fbdev code falls back to a
naive implementation which relies upon the DMA address being the same
as the physical address, and the buffer being physically contiguous
from there. Whilst this often holds for standard CMA allocations via
the platform's regular DMA ops, if the allocation is provided by an
IOMMU then such assumptions can fall apart spectacularly.

To resolve this, reroute the fb_mmap call to the appropriate DMA API
implementation, as per the other cma_helper calls.
