iio: accel: kxsd9: Fix scaling bug

All the scaling of the KXSD9 involves multiplication with a
fraction number < 1.

However the scaling value returned from IIO_INFO_SCALE was
unpredictable as only the micros of the value was assigned, and
not the integer part, resulting in scaling like this:

$cat in_accel_scale
-1057462640.011978

Fix this by assigning zero to the integer part.
