[media] si2168: add support for newer firmwares

Si2168-B40 firmware API has changed somewhere between 4.0-11 and
4.0-19 so that sleep will lose firmware upgrade from the chip. Due
to that firmware re-upload is needed when newer firmwares are used.

Rewrote firmware handling logic partly at the same.
