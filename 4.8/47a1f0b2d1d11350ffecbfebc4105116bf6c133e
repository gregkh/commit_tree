crypto: marvell - Increase the size of the crypto queue

Now that crypto requests are chained together at the DMA level, we
increase the size of the crypto queue for each engine. The result is
that as the backlog list is reached later, it does not stop the crypto
stack from sending asychronous requests, so more cryptographic tasks
are processed by the engines.
