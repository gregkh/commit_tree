usercopy: fold builtin_const check into inline function

Instead of having each caller of check_object_size() need to remember to
check for a const size parameter, move the check into check_object_size()
itself. This actually matches the original implementation in PaX, though
this commit cleans up the now-redundant builtin_const() calls in the
various architectures.
