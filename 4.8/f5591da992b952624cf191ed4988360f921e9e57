[media] adv7604: Add support for hardware reset

The part can be reset by a low pulse on the RESET pin (i.e. a hardware
reset) with a minimum width of 5 ms. It is recommended to wait 5 ms
after the low pulse before an I2C write is performed to the part.
For safety reasons, the delays will be between 5 and 10 ms.

The RESET pin can be tied high, so the GPIO is optional.
