perf probe: Introduce perf_cache interfaces

Introduce perf_cache object and interfaces to create, add entries,
commit, and delete the object.

perf_cache represents a file for the cached "perf probe" definitions on
one binary file or vmlinux which has its own build id. The probe cache
file is located under the build-id cache directory of the target binary,
as below;

  <perf-debug-dir>/.build-id/<BU>/<ILDID>/probe
