pNFS: Ensure LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTRETURN are properly serialised

According to RFC5661, the client is responsible for serialising
LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTRETURN to avoid ambiguity. Consider the case
where we send both in parallel.

Client					Server
======					======
LAYOUTGET(seqid=X)
LAYOUTRETURN(seqid=X)
					LAYOUTGET return seqid=X+1
					LAYOUTRETURN return seqid=X+2
Process LAYOUTRETURN
          Forget layout stateid
Process LAYOUTGET
          Set seqid=X+1

The client processes the layoutget/layoutreturn in the wrong order,
and since the result of the layoutreturn was to clear the only
existing layout segment, the client forgets the layout stateid.

When the LAYOUTGET comes in, it is treated as having a completely
new stateid, and so the client sets the wrong sequence id...

Fix is to check if there are outstanding LAYOUTGET requests
before we send the LAYOUTRETURN (note that LAYOUGET will already
wait if it sees an outstanding LAYOUTRETURN).
