drivers/perf: arm_pmu: Fix NULL pointer dereference during probe

Patch 7f1d642fbb5c ("drivers/perf: arm-pmu: Fix handling of SPI lacking
interrupt-affinity property") unintended also fixes perf_event support
for bcm2835 which doesn't have PMU interrupts. Unfortunately this change
introduce a NULL pointer dereference on bcm2835, because irq_is_percpu
always expected to be called with a valid IRQ. So fix this regression
by validating the IRQ before.
