drm/i915: use ORIGIN_CPU for frontbuffer invalidation on WC mmaps

... instead of the previous ORIGIN_GTT. This should actually
invalidate FBC once something is written on the frontbuffer using WC
mmaps. The problem with ORIGIN_GTT is that the automatic hardware
tracking is not able to detect the WC writes as it can detect the GTT
writes.

This should help fix the SKL bug where nothing happens when you type
your username/password on lightdm.

This patch was originally pasted on an email by Chris and converted to
an actual git patch by Paulo.

v2 (from Paulo):
 - Make it a full variable instead of a bit-field (Daniel)
