xen: xenbus: Remove create_workqueue

System workqueues have been able to handle high level of concurrency
for a long time now and there's no reason to use dedicated workqueues
just to gain concurrency.  Replace dedicated xenbus_frontend_wq with the
use of system_wq.

Unlike a dedicated per-cpu workqueue created with create_workqueue(),
system_wq allows multiple work items to overlap executions even on
the same CPU; however, a per-cpu workqueue doesn't have any CPU
locality or global ordering guarantees unless the target CPU is
explicitly specified and the increase of local concurrency shouldn't
make any difference.

In this case, there is only a single work item, increase of concurrency
level by switching to system_wq should not make any difference.
