perf config: Introduce new init() and exit()

Many sub-commands use perf_config() but everytime perf_config() is
called, perf_config() always read config files.  (i.e. user config
'~/.perfconfig' and system config '$(sysconfdir)/perfconfig')

But it is better to use the config set that already contains all config
key-value pairs to avoid this repetitive work reading the config files
in perf_config(). (the config set mean a static variable 'config_set')

In other words, if new perf_config__init() is called, only first time
'config_set' is initialized collecting all configs from the config
files.  And then we could use new perf_config() like old perf_config().
When a sub-command finished, free the config set by perf_config__exit()
at run_builtin().

If we do, 'config_set' can be reused wherever perf_config() is called
and a feature of old perf_config() is the same as new perf_config() work
without the repetitive work that read the config files.

In summary, in order to use features about configuration,
we can call the functions at perf.c and other source files as below.

    # initialize a config set
    perf_config__init()

    # configure actual variables from a config set
    perf_config()

    # eliminate allocated config set
    perf_config__exit()

    # destroy existing config set and initialize a new config set.
    perf_config__refresh()

[ 'init' counterpart is 'exit', not 'finish' ]
