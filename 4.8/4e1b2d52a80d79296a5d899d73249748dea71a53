block, fs, drivers: remove REQ_OP compat defs and related code

This patch drops the compat definition of req_op where it matches
the rq_flag_bits definitions, and drops the related old and compat
code that allowed users to set either the op or flags for the operation.

We also then store the operation in the bi_rw/cmd_flags field similar
to how we used to store the bio ioprio where it sat in the upper bits
of the field.
