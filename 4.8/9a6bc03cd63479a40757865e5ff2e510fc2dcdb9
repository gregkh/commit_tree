drm/doc: document all the properties in drm_mode_config

I'm fed up with the warning noise from kernel-doc.

Aside: I stumbled over dirty_info_property, which is only set by udl
and qxl. But we have a _lot_ more drivers implementing a dirty
callback on framebuffers. Not entirely sure what the ABI is supposed
to be here, but it seems confusing for sure.
