SUNRPC: Fix infinite looping in rpc_clnt_iterate_for_each_xprt

If there were less than 2 entries in the multipath list, then
xprt_iter_next_entry_multiple() would never advance beyond the
first entry, which is correct for round robin behaviour, but not
for the list iteration.

The end result would be infinite looping in rpc_clnt_iterate_for_each_xprt()
as we would never see the xprt == NULL condition fulfilled.
