drm/i915: Record the ringbuffer associated with the request

The request tells us where to read the ringbuf from, so use that
information to simplify the error capture. If no request was active at
the time of the hang, the ring is idle and there is no information
inside the ring pertaining to the hang.

Note carefully that this will reduce the amount of information stored in
the error state - any ring without an active request will not be
recorded.
