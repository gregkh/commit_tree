Bluetooth: Fix hci_sock_recvmsg return value

If recvmsg is called with a destination buffer that is too small to
receive the contents of skb in its entirety, the return value from
recvmsg was inconsistent with common SOCK_SEQPACKET or SOCK_DGRAM
semantics.

If destination buffer provided by userspace is too small (e.g. len <
copied), then MSG_TRUNC flag is set and copied is returned.  Instead, it
should return the length of the message, which is consistent with how
other datagram based sockets act.  Quoting 'man recv':

"All  three calls return the length of the message on successful comple‐
tion.  If a message is too long to fit in the supplied  buffer,  excess
bytes  may  be discarded depending on the type of socket the message is
received from."

and

"MSG_TRUNC (since Linux 2.2)

    For   raw   (AF_PACKET),   Internet   datagram   (since    Linux
    2.4.27/2.6.8),  netlink  (since Linux 2.6.22), and UNIX datagram
    (since Linux 3.4) sockets: return the real length of the packet
    or datagram, even when it was longer than the passed buffer."
