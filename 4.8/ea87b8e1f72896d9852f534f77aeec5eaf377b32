rapidio: remove unnecessary 0x prefixes before %pa extension uses

Patch series "RapidIO subsystem updates".

This set of patches contains RapidIO subsystem fixes and updates that
have been made since kernel v4.6.  The most significant update brings
changes related to the latest revision of RapidIO specification
(rev.3.x) and introduction of next generation of RapidIO switches by IDT
(RXS1632 and RXS2448).

This patch (of 13):

This is RapidIO part of the original patch submitted by Joe Perches.
(see: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/3/5/19)

Since commit 3cab1e711297 ("lib/vsprintf: refactor duplicate code
to special_hex_number()") %pa uses have been output with a 0x prefix.

These 0x prefixes in the formats are unnecessary.
