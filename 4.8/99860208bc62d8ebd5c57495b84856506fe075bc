sched: remove NET_XMIT_POLICED

sch_atm returns this when TC_ACT_SHOT classification occurs.

But all other schedulers that use tc_classify
(htb, hfsc, drr, fq_codel ...) return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS | __BYPASS
in this case so just do that in atm.

BATMAN uses it as an intermediate return value to signal
forwarding vs. buffering, but it did not return POLICED to
callers outside of BATMAN.
