drm: Move master functions into drm_auth.c

For modern drivers pretty much the only thing drm_master does is
handling authentication for the primary/legacy drm_minor node. Instead
of having it all over drm files, move it all together into drm_auth.c.

This patch just does code-motion, follow up patches will also extract
the master logic from file open&release paths.
