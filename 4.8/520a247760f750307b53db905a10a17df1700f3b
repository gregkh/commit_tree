doc-rst: Fix compilation of the pdf docbook

The rst2pdf tool is a very broken toolchain, with is not capable
of parsing complex documents. As such, it doesn't build the
media book, failing with:

	[ERROR] pdfbuilder.py:130 too many values to unpack

(using rst2pdf version 0.93.dev-r0 and Sphinx version 1.4.5)

So, make it build only the books we know that are safe to build.

Btw, with the standard Sphinx version shipped on Fedora 24 (Sphinx
1.3.1), rst2pdf doesn't build even the simple kernel-documentation,
failing with this error:
    writing Kernel... [ERROR] pdfbuilder.py:130 list index out of range

This is a known bug:
    https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1844

So, maybe we should just disable pdf generation from RST for good,
as I suspect that maintaining it with a broken toolchain will be a
big headache.
