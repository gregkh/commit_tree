usb: dwc3: gadget: add a pointer to endpoint registers

By adding a pointer to endpoint registers' base
address, we can avoid using our controller-wide
struct dwc3 pointer for everything. At some point
this will allow us to have per-endpoint locks which
will, in turn, let us queue requests to separate
endpoints in parallel.

Because of this change our debugfs interface and io
accessors need to be changed accordingly.
