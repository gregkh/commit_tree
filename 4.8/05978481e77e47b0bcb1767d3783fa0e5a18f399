mlxsw: spectrum: Create PVID vPort before registering netdevice

After registering a netdevice it's possible for user space applications
to configure an IP address on it. From the driver's perspective, this
means a router interface (RIF) should be created for the PVID vPort.

Therefore, we must create the PVID vPort before registering the
netdevice.
