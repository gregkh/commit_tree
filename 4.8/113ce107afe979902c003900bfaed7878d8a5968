net/faraday: Read MAC address from chip

The device is assigned with random MAC address. It isn't reasonable.
An valid MAC address might have been provided by (uboot) firmware by
device-tree or in chip. It's reasonable to use it to maintain consistency.

This uses the MAC address from device-tree or that in the chip if it's
valid. Otherwise, a random MAC address is given as before.
