xfs: kill xfs_dir2_inou_t

And use an array of unsigned char values directly to avoid problems
with architectures that pad the size of structures.  This also gets
rid of the xfs_dir2_ino4_t and xfs_dir2_ino8_t types, and introduces
new constants for the size of 4 and 8 bytes as well as the size
difference between the two.
