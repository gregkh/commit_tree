efi: Document #define FOO_PROTOCOL_GUID layout

Add a comment documenting why EFI GUIDs are laid out like they are.

Ideally I'd like to change all the ", " to "," too, but right now the
format is such that checkpatch won't complain with new ones, and staring
at checkpatch didn't get me anywhere towards making that work.
