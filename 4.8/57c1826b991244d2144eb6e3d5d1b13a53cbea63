hv_netvsc: reset vf_inject on VF removal

We reset vf_inject on VF going down (netvsc_vf_down()) but we don't on
VF removal (netvsc_unregister_vf()) so vf_inject stays 'true' while
vf_netdev is already NULL and we're trying to inject packets into NULL
net device in netvsc_recv_callback() causing kernel to crash.
