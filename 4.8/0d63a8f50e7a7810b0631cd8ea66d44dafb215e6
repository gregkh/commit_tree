fm10k: enable bus master after every reset

If an FLR occurs, VF devices will be knocked out of bus master mode, and
the driver will be unable to recover from the reset properly, resulting
in malicious driver events and an infinite reset loop. In the normal
case, the bus master mode will already be enabled and this call will
essentially be a no-op. Since we're doing this every reset, it is
possible we could remove the other calls to pci_set_master() but it
seems not harmful to just leave them in place.
