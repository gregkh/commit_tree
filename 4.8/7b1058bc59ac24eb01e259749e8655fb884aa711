s390/cio/chp : Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

The workqueue "chp_wq" is involved in performing pending
configure tasks for channel paths.

It has a single work item(&cfg_work) and hence doesn't require
ordering. Also, it is not being used on a memory reclaim path.
Hence, the singlethreaded workqueue has been replaced with the use of
system_wq.

System workqueues have been able to handle high level of concurrency
for a long time now and hence it's not required to have a singlethreaded
workqueue just to gain concurrency. Unlike a dedicated per-cpu workqueue
created with create_singlethread_workqueue(), system_wq allows multiple
work items to overlap executions even on the same CPU; however, a
per-cpu workqueue doesn't have any CPU locality or global ordering
guarantee unless the target CPU is explicitly specified and thus the
increase of local concurrency shouldn't make any difference.
