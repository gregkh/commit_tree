ravb: Add ESF in RCR for enabling separation filter

The H/W manual recommends B'10 or B'11 in a value of the separation
filtering select bits in the receive configuration register (RCR.ESF).
When B'10 is set, frames from non-matching streams are discarded.
When B'11 is set, frames from non-matching streams are processed in
reception queue 0 (best effort).
This patch sets B'11 in ESF.
