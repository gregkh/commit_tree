xfs: create rmap update intent log items

Create rmap update intent/done log items to record redo information in
the log.  Because we need to roll transactions between updating the
bmbt mapping and updating the reverse mapping, we also have to track
the status of the metadata updates that will be recorded in the
post-roll transactions, just in case we crash before committing the
final transaction.  This mechanism enables log recovery to finish what
was already started.
