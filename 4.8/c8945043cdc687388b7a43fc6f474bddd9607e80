sched: place state, next_sched and gso_skb in same cacheline again

Earlier commits removed two members from struct Qdisc which places
next_sched/gso_skb into a different cacheline than ->state.

This restores the struct layout to what it was before the removal.
Move the two members, then add an annotation so they all reside in the
same cacheline.

This adds a 16 byte hole after cpu_qstats.

The hole could be closed but as it doesn't decrease total struct size just
do it this way.
