drm/vc4: Use drm_gem_object_unreference_unlocked

Since my last struct_mutex crusade someone escaped!

This already has the advantage that for the common case when someone
else holds a ref the unref won't even acquire dev->struct_mutex. And
I'm working on code to allow drivers to completely opt-out of any and
all dev->struct_mutex usage, but that only works if they use the
_unlocked variants everywhere.

v2: Drop comment too.

v3: Drop the other comment too.
