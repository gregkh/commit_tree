sparc32: remove stale RTC_PORT definition

sparc32:allmodconfig fails to build in next-20160602 as follows.

The reason is a duplicate definition of the RTC_PORT macro. The
one in arch/sparc/include/asm/io_32.h was apparently used a long time
ago for the drivers/char/rtc.c driver that is not available on SPARC
any more, since we now select 'RTC_CLASS' unconditionally.

Removing the macro fixes the build problem, and for consistency,
this also removes the RTC_ALWAYS_BCD macro and the comment for both.
