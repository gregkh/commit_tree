RDS: Do not send a pong to an incoming ping with 0 src port

RDS ping messages are sent with a non-zero src port to a zero
dst port, so that the rds pong messages can be sent back to the
originators src port. However if a confused/malicious sender
sends a ping with a 0 src port, we'd have an infinite ping-pong
loop. To avoid this, the receiver should ignore ping messages
with a 0 src port.
