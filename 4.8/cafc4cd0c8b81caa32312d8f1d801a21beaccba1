arm64: dts: apm: Use lowercase consistently for hex constants

The convention in these files is to use lowercase for "0x" prefixes and for
the hex constants themselves, but a few changes didn't follow that
convention, which makes the file annoying to read.

Use lowercase consistently for the hex constants.  No functional change
intended.
