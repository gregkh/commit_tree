ipv4: af_inet: make it explicitly non-modular

The Makefile controlling compilation of this file is obj-y,
meaning that it currently is never being built as a module.

Since MODULE_ALIAS is a no-op for non-modular code, we can simply
remove the MODULE_ALIAS_NETPROTO variant used here.

We replace module.h with kmod.h since the file does make use of
request_module() in order to load other modules from here.

We don't have to worry about init.h coming in via the removed
module.h since the file explicitly includes init.h already.
