dma-buf/fence: add fence_array fences v6

struct fence_array inherits from struct fence and carries a
collection of fences that needs to be waited together.

It is useful to translate a sync_file to a fence to remove the complexity
of dealing with sync_files on DRM drivers. So even if there are many
fences in the sync_file that needs to waited for a commit to happen,
they all get added to the fence_collection and passed for DRM use as
a standard struct fence.

That means that no changes needed to any driver besides supporting fences.

To avoid fence_array's fence allocates a new timeline if needed (when
combining fences from different timelines).

v2: Comments by Daniel Vetter:
	- merge fence_collection_init() and fence_collection_add()
	- only add callbacks at ->enable_signalling()
	- remove fence_collection_put()
	- check for type on to_fence_collection()
	- adjust fence_is_later() and fence_later() to WARN_ON() if they
	are used with collection fences.

v3: - Initialize fence_cb.node at fence init.

    Comments by Chris Wilson:
	- return "unbound" on fence_collection_get_timeline_name()
	- don't stop adding callbacks if one fails
	- remove redundant !! on fence_collection_enable_signaling()
	- remove redundant () on fence_collection_signaled
	- use fence_default_wait() instead

v4 (chk): Rework, simplification and cleanup:
	- Drop FENCE_NO_CONTEXT handling, always allocate a context.
	- Rename to fence_array.
	- Return fixed driver name.
	- Register only one callback at a time.
	- Document that create function takes ownership of array.

v5 (chk): More work and fixes:
	- Avoid deadlocks by adding all callbacks at once again.
	- Stop trying to remove the callbacks.
	- Provide context and sequence number for the array fence.

v6 (chk): Fixes found during testing
	- Fix stupid typo in _enable_signaling().
