KVM: Fix steal clock warp during guest CPU hotplug

Sometimes, after CPU hotplug you can observe a spike in stolen time
(100%) followed by the CPU being marked as 100% idle when it's actually
busy with a CPU hog task.  The trace looks like the following:

 cpuhp/1-12    [001] d.h1   167.461657: account_process_tick: steal = 1291385514, prev_steal_time = 0
 cpuhp/1-12    [001] d.h1   167.461659: account_process_tick: steal_jiffies = 1291
  <idle>-0     [001] d.h1   167.462663: account_process_tick: steal = 18732255, prev_steal_time = 1291000000
  <idle>-0     [001] d.h1   167.462664: account_process_tick: steal_jiffies = 18446744072437

The sudden decrease of "steal" causes steal_jiffies to underflow.
The root cause is kvm_steal_time being reset to 0 after hot-plugging
back in a CPU.  Instead, the preexisting value can be used, which is
what the core scheduler code expects.

John Stultz also reported a similar issue after guest S3.
