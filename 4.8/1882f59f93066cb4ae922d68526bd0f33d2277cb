[media] af9035: fix for MXL5007T devices with I2C read issues

The MXL5007T tuner will lock-up on some devices after an I2C read
transaction.  This patch works around this issue by inhibiting such
operations and emulating a 0x00 response. The workaround is only
applied to USB devices known to exhibit this flaw.
