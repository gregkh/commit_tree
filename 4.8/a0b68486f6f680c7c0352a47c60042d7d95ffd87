net: ethernet: bgmac: add dma_dev pointer

The dma buffer allocation, etc references a dma_dev device pointer from
the bcma core.  In anticipation of removing the bcma requirement for
this driver, these must be changed to not reference that struct.  Add a
dma_dev device pointer to the bgmac stuct and reference that instead.
