net: ethernet: renesas: sh_eth: add POST registers for rz

Due to a mistake in the hardware manual, the FWSLC and POST1-4 registers
were not documented and left out of the driver for RZ/A making the CAM
feature non-operational.
Additionally, when the offset values for POST1-4 are left blank, the driver
attempts to set them using an offset of 0xFFFF which can cause a memory
corruption or panic.

This patch fixes the panic and properly enables CAM.
