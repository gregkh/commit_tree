xfs: add function pointers for get/update keys to the btree

Add some function pointers to bc_ops to get the btree keys for
leaf and node blocks, and to update parent keys of a block.
Convert the _btree_updkey calls to use our new pointer, and
modify the tree shape changing code to call the appropriate
get_*_keys pointer instead of _btree_copy_keys because the
overlapping btree has to calculate high key values.
