perf data ctf: Pass convert options through opts structure

Following commits will add new option to 'perf data convert'. All options
should be grouped into a structure and passed to low level converter
(currently there's only one converter).

Introduce data-convert.h and define 'struct perf_data_convert_opts' in
it. Pass 'force' through opts.
