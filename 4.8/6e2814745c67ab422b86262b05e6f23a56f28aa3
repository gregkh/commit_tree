locking/mutex: Set and clear owner using WRITE_ONCE()

The mutex owner can get read and written to locklessly.
Use WRITE_ONCE when setting and clearing the owner field
in order to avoid optimizations such as store tearing. This
avoids situations where the owner field gets written to with
multiple stores and another thread could concurrently read
and use a partially written owner value.
