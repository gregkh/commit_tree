net/sched: Add match-all classifier hw offloading.

Following the work that have been done on offloading classifiers like u32
and flower, now the match-all classifier hw offloading is possible. if
the interface supports tc offloading.

To control the offloading, two tc flags have been introduced: skip_sw and
skip_hw. Typical usage:

tc filter add dev eth25 parent ffff: 	\
	matchall skip_sw		\
	action mirred egress mirror	\
	dev eth27
