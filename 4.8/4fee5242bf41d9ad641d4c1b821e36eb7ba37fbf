calipso: Add a label cache.

This works in exactly the same way as the CIPSO label cache.
The idea is to allow the lsm to cache the result of a secattr
lookup so that it doesn't need to perform the lookup for
every skbuff.

It introduces two sysctl controls:
 calipso_cache_enable - enables/disables the cache.
 calipso_cache_bucket_size - sets the size of a cache bucket.
