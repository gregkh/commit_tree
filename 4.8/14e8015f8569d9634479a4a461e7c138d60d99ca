iio: pressure: bmp280: split driver in logical parts

This splits the BMP280 driver in three logical parts: the core driver
bmp280-core that only operated on a struct device * and a struct regmap *,
the regmap driver bmp280-regmap that can be shared between I2C and other
transports and the I2C module driver bmp280-i2c.

Cleverly bake all functionality into a single object bmp280.o so that
we still get the same module binary built for the device in the end,
without any fuzz exporting symbols to the left and right.
