f2fs: remove syncing inode page in all the cases

This patch reduces to call them across the whole tree.
- sync_inode_page()
- update_inode_page()
- update_inode()
- f2fs_write_inode()

Instead, checkpoint will flush all the dirty inode metadata before syncing
node pages.
Note that, this is doable, since we call mark_inode_dirty_sync() for all
inode's field change which needs to update on-disk inode as well.
