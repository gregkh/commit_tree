wlcore/wl18xx: mesh: added initial mesh support for wl8

1. Added support for interface and role of mesh type.
2. Enabled enable/start of mesh-point role,
   and opening and closing a connection with a mesh peer.
3. Added multirole combination of mesh and ap
   under the same limits of dual ap mode.
4. Add support for 'sta_rc_update' opcode for mesh IF.
   The 'sta_rc_update' opcode is being used in mesh_plink.c.
Add support in wlcore to handle this opcode correctly for mesh
(as opposed to current implementation that handles STA only).
5. Bumped the firmware version to support new Mesh functionality
