i2c: smbus: add SMBus Host Notify support

SMBus Host Notify allows a slave device to act as a master on a bus to
notify the host of an interrupt. On Intel chipsets, the functionality
is directly implemented in the firmware. We just need to export a
function to call .alert() on the proper device driver.

i2c_handle_smbus_host_notify() behaves like i2c_handle_smbus_alert().
When called, it schedules a task that will be able to sleep to go through
the list of devices attached to the adapter.

The current implementation allows one Host Notification to be scheduled
while an other is running.
