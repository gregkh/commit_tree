iommu/exynos: Prepare clocks when needed, not in driver probe

Make clock preparation together with clk_enable(). This way inactive
SYSMMU controllers will not keep clocks prepared all the time.
This change allows more fine graded power management in the future.
All the code assumes that clock management doesn't fail, so guard
clock_prepare_enable() it with BUG_ON().
