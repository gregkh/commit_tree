mnt: Refactor fs_fully_visible into mount_too_revealing

Replace the call of fs_fully_visible in do_new_mount from before the
new superblock is allocated with a call of mount_too_revealing after
the superblock is allocated.   This winds up being a much better location
for maintainability of the code.

The first change this enables is the replacement of FS_USERNS_VISIBLE
with SB_I_USERNS_VISIBLE.  Moving the flag from struct filesystem_type
to sb_iflags on the superblock.

Unfortunately mount_too_revealing fundamentally needs to touch
mnt_flags adding several MNT_LOCKED_XXX flags at the appropriate
times.  If the mnt_flags did not need to be touched the code
could be easily moved into the filesystem specific mount code.
