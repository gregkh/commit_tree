firmware: qcom: scm: Convert to streaming DMA APIS

This patch converts the Qualcomm SCM driver to use the streaming DMA APIs
for communication buffers.  This is being done so that the
secure_flush_area call can be removed.  Using the DMA APIs will also make
the SCM32 symmetric to the coming SCM64 code.
