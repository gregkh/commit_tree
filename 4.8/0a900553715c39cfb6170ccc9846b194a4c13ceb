MIPS: Octeon: mark GPIO controller node not populated after IRQ init.

We clear the OF_POPULATED flag for the GPIO controller node on Octeon
processors. Otherwise, none of the devices hanging on the GPIO lines
are probed. The 'gpio-leds' driver on OCTEON failed to probe in addition
to other devices on Cavium 71xx and 78xx development boards.
