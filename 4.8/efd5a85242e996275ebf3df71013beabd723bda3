PM / hibernate: Clean up function headers in snapshot.c

The formatting of some function headers in kernel/power/snapshot.c
is not consistent with the general kernel coding style and with the
formatting of some other function headers in the same file.

Make all of them follow the same formatting convention.

No functional changes.
