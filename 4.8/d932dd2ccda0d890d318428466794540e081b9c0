nfit: use devm_add_action_or_reset()

If devm_add_action() fails, we are explicitly calling the cleanup to free
the resources allocated. Lets use the helper devm_add_action_or_reset()
and return directly in case of error, since the cleanup function
has been already called by the helper if there was any error.
