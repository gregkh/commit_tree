drm/i915: Remove the identical implementations of request space reservation

Now that we share intel_ring_begin(), reserving space for the tail of
the request is identical between legacy/execlists and so the tautology
can be removed. In the process, we move the reserved space tracking
from the ringbuffer on to the request. This is to enable us to reorder
the reserved space allocation in the next patch.
