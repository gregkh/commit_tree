PM / Domains: Convert pm_genpd_init() to return an error code

The are already cases when pm_genpd_init() can fail. Currently we hide the
failures instead of propagating an error code, which is a better method.

Moreover, to prepare for future changes like moving away from using a
fixed array-size of the struct genpd_power_state, to instead dynamically
allocate data for it, the pm_genpd_init() API needs to be able to return
an error code, as allocation can fail.

Current users of the pm_genpd_init() is thus requested to start dealing
with error codes. In the transition phase, users will have to live with
only error messages being printed to log.
