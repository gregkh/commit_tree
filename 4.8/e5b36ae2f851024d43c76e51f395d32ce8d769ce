usb: dwc3: gadget: fix for short pkts during chained xfers

DWC3 has one interesting peculiarity with chained
transfers. If we setup N chained transfers and we
get a short packet before processing all N TRBs,
DWC3 will (conditionally) issue a XferComplete or
XferInProgress event and retire all TRBs from the
one which got a short packet to the last without
clearing their HWO bits.

This means SW must clear HWO bit manually, which
this patch is doing.
