Btrfs: add bytes_readonly to the spaceinfo at once

For some reason we're adding bytes_readonly to the space info after we update
the space info with the block group info.  This creates a tiny race where we
could over-reserve space because we haven't yet taken out the bytes_readonly
bit.  Since we already know this information at the time we call
update_space_info, just pass it along so it can be updated all at once.  Thanks,
