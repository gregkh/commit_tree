pNFS: Always update the layout barrier seqid on LAYOUTGET

Currently, pnfs_set_layout_stateid() will update the layout sequence
id barrier only if the stateid itself is newer than the current
layout stateid. However in a situation where multiple LAYOUTGET calls
and a LAYOUTRETURN raced, it is entirely possible for one of the
LAYOUTGET to set the current stateid to something newer than the
LAYOUTRETURN that needs to set the barrier.

The fix is to allow the "update_barrier" flag to force a check as to
whether or not the barrier needs to be updated.
