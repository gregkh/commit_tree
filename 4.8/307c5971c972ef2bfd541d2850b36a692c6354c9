PM / hibernate: Recycle safe pages after image restoration

One of the memory bitmaps used by the hibernation image restoration
code is freed after the image has been loaded.

That is not quite efficient, though, because the memory pages used
for building that bitmap are known to be safe (ie. they were not
used by the image kernel before hibernation) and the arch-specific
code finalizing the image restoration may need them.  In that case
it needs to allocate those pages again via the memory management
subsystem, check if they are really safe again by consulting the
other bitmaps and so on.

To avoid that, recycle those pages by putting them into the global
list of known safe pages so that they can be given to the arch code
right away when necessary.
