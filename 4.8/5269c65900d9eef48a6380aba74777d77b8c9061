ath10k: fix CCK h/w rates for QCA99X0 and newer chipsets

CCK hardware table mapping from QCA99X0 onwards got revised.
The CCK hardware rate values are in a proper order wrt. to
rate and preamble as below

ATH10K_HW_RATE_REV2_CCK_LP_1M = 1,
ATH10K_HW_RATE_REV2_CCK_LP_2M = 2,
ATH10K_HW_RATE_REV2_CCK_LP_5_5M = 3,
ATH10K_HW_RATE_REV2_CCK_LP_11M = 4,
ATH10K_HW_RATE_REV2_CCK_SP_2M = 5,
ATH10K_HW_RATE_REV2_CCK_SP_5_5M = 6,
ATH10K_HW_RATE_REV2_CCK_SP_11M = 7,

This results in reporting of rx frames (with CCK rates)
totally wrong for QCA99X0, QCA4019. Fix this by having
separate CCK rate table for these chipsets with rev2 suffix
and registering the correct rate mapping to mac80211 based on
the new hw_param (introduced) 'cck_rate_map_rev2' which shall
be true for any newchipsets from QCA99X0 onwards
