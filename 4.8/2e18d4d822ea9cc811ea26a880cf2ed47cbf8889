pNFS: Files and flexfiles always need to commit before layoutcommit

So ensure that we mark the layout for commit once the write is done,
and then ensure that the commit to ds is finished before sending
layoutcommit.

Note that by doing this, we're able to optimise away the commit
for the case of servers that don't need layoutcommit in order to
return updated attributes.
