mm, page_alloc: remove fair zone allocation policy

The fair zone allocation policy interleaves allocation requests between
zones to avoid an age inversion problem whereby new pages are reclaimed
to balance a zone.  Reclaim is now node-based so this should no longer
be an issue and the fair zone allocation policy is not free.  This patch
removes it.
