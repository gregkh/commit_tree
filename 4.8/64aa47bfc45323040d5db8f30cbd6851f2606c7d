KVM: x86: add kvm_apic_map_get_dest_lapic

kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic_fast and kvm_intr_is_single_vcpu_fast both
compute the interrupt destination.  Factor the code.

'struct kvm_lapic **dst = NULL' had to be added to silence GCC.
GCC might complain about potential NULL access in the future, because it
missed conditions that avoided uninitialized uses of dst.
