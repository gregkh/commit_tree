ARM: s3c64xx: smartq: Avoid sparse warnings

The smartq_map_io() and smartq_machine_init() functions are used by both
SmartQ 5 and SmartQ 7 machines and exported via the mach-smartq.h header
file. However that header file is not included by the mach-smartq.c file
that implements them, causing sparse warnings.

Include mach-smartq.h from mach-smartq.c to fix these warnings.
