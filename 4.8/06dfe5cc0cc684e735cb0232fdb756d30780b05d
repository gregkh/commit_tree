ARM: sa1111: fix pcmcia suspend/resume

SA1111 PCMCIA was broken when PCMCIA switched to using dev_pm_ops for
the PCMCIA socket class.  PCMCIA used to handle suspend/resume via the
socket hosting device, which happened at normal device suspend/resume
time.

However, the referenced commit changed this: much of the resume now
happens much earlier, in the noirq resume handler of dev_pm_ops.

However, on SA1111, the PCMCIA device is not accessible as the SA1111
has not been resumed at _noirq time.  It's slightly worse than that,
because the SA1111 has already been put to sleep at _noirq time, so
suspend doesn't work properly.

Fix this by converting the core SA1111 code to use dev_pm_ops as well,
and performing its own suspend/resume at noirq time.

This fixes these errors in the kernel log:

pcmcia_socket pcmcia_socket0: time out after reset
pcmcia_socket pcmcia_socket1: time out after reset

and the resulting lack of PCMCIA cards after a S2RAM cycle.
