xfs: rmap btree requires more reserved free space

Originally-From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

The rmap btree is allocated from the AGFL, which means we have to
ensure ENOSPC is reported to userspace before we run out of free
space in each AG. The last allocation in an AG can cause a full
height rmap btree split, and that means we have to reserve at least
this many blocks *in each AG* to be placed on the AGFL at ENOSPC.
Update the various space calculation functions to handle this.

Also, because the macros are now executing conditional code and are
called quite frequently, convert them to functions that initialise
variables in the struct xfs_mount, use the new variables everywhere
and document the calculations better.
