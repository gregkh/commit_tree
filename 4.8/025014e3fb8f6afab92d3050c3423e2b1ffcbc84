MIPS: KVM: Drop redundant restore of DDATA_LO

On return from the exit handler to the host (without re-entering the
guest) we restore the saved value of the DDATA_LO register which we use
as a scratch register. However we've already restored it ready for
calling the exit handler so there is no need to do it again, so drop
that code.
