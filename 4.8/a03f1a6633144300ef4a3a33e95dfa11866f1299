xfs: remove OWN_AG rmap when allocating a block from the AGFL

When we're really tight on space, xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_small() can
allocate a block from the AGFL and give it to the caller.  Since the
caller is never the AGFL-fixing method, we must remove the OWN_AG
reverse mapping because it will clash with whatever rmap the caller
wants to set up.  This bug was discovered by running generic/299
repeatedly.
