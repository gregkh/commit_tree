hv_netvsc: fix bonding devices check in netvsc_netdev_event()

Bonding driver sets IFF_BONDING on both master (the bonding device) and
slave (the real NIC) devices and in netvsc_netdev_event() we want to skip
master devices only. Currently, there is an uncertainty when a slave
interface is removed: if bonding module comes first in netdev_chain it
clears IFF_BONDING flag on the netdev and netvsc_netdev_event() correctly
handles NETDEV_UNREGISTER event, but in case netvsc comes first on the
chain it sees the device with IFF_BONDING still attached and skips it. As
we still hold vf_netdev pointer to the device we crash on the next inject.
