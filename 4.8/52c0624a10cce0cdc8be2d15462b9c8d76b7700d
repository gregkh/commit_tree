phy: rockchip-emmc: Set phyctrl_frqsel based on card clock

The "phyctrl_frqsel" is described in the Arasan datasheet [1] as "the
frequency range of DLL operation".  Although the Rockchip variant of
this PHY has different ranges than the reference Arasan PHY it appears
as if the functionality is similar.  We should set this phyctrl field
properly.

Note: as per Rockchip engineers, apparently the "phyctrl_frqsel" is
actually only useful in HS200 / HS400 modes even though the DLL itself
it used for some purposes in all modes.  See the discussion in the
earlier change in this series: ("mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: Always power the
PHY off/on when clock changes").  In any case, it shouldn't hurt to set
this always.

Note that this change should allow boards to run at HS200 / HS400 speed
modes while running at 100 MHz or 150 MHz.  In fact, running HS400 at
150 MHz (giving 300 MB/s) is the main motivation of this series, since
performance is still good but signal integrity problems are less
prevelant at 150 MHz.
