mm: track NR_KERNEL_STACK in KiB instead of number of stacks

Currently, NR_KERNEL_STACK tracks the number of kernel stacks in a zone.
This only makes sense if each kernel stack exists entirely in one zone,
and allowing vmapped stacks could break this assumption.

Since frv has THREAD_SIZE < PAGE_SIZE, we need to track kernel stack
allocations in a unit that divides both THREAD_SIZE and PAGE_SIZE on all
architectures.  Keep it simple and use KiB.
