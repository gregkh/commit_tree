s390/pgtable: add mapping statistics

Add statistics that show how memory is mapped within the kernel
identity mapping. This is more or less the same like git
commit ce0c0e50f94e ("x86, generic: CPA add statistics about state
of direct mapping v4") for x86.

I also intentionally copied the lower case "k" within DirectMap4k vs
the upper case "M" and "G" within the two other lines. Let's have
consistent inconsistencies across architectures.

The output of /proc/meminfo now contains these additional lines:

DirectMap4k:        2048 kB
DirectMap1M:     3991552 kB
DirectMap2G:     4194304 kB

The implementation on s390 is lockless unlike the x86 version, since I
assume changes to the kernel mapping are a very rare event. Therefore
it really doesn't matter if these statistics could potentially be
inconsistent if read while kernel pages tables are being changed.
