xfs: exclude never-released buffers from buftarg I/O accounting

The upcoming buftarg I/O accounting mechanism maintains a count of
all buffers that have undergone I/O in the current hold-release
cycle.  Certain buffers associated with core infrastructure (e.g.,
the xfs_mount superblock buffer, log buffers) are never released,
however. This means that accounting I/O submission on such buffers
elevates the buftarg count indefinitely and could lead to lockup on
unmount.

Define a new buffer flag to explicitly exclude buffers from buftarg
I/O accounting. Set the flag on the superblock and associated log
buffers.
