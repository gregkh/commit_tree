s390/time: add leap seconds to initial system time

The PTFF instruction can be used to retrieve information about UTC
including the current number of leap seconds. Use this value to
convert the coordinated server time value of the TOD clock to a
proper UTC timestamp to initialize the system time. Without this
correction the system time will be off by the number of leap seonds
until it has been corrected via NTP.
