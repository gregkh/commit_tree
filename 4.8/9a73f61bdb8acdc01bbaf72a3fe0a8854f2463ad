thp, mlock: do not mlock PTE-mapped file huge pages

As with anon THP, we only mlock file huge pages if we can prove that the
page is not mapped with PTE.  This way we can avoid mlock leak into
non-mlocked vma on split.

We rely on PageDoubleMap() under lock_page() to check if the the page
may be PTE mapped.  PG_double_map is set by page_add_file_rmap() when
the page mapped with PTEs.
