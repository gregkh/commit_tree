netvsc: get rid of completion timeouts

I'm hitting 5 second timeout in rndis_filter_set_rss_param() while setting
RSS parameters for the device. When this happens we end up returning
-ETIMEDOUT from the function and rndis_filter_device_add() falls back to
setting

        net_device->max_chn = 1;
        net_device->num_chn = 1;
        net_device->num_sc_offered = 0;

but after a moment the rndis request succeeds and subchannels start to
appear. netvsc_sc_open() does unconditional nvscdev->num_sc_offered-- and
it becomes U32_MAX-1. Consequent rndis_filter_device_remove() will hang
while waiting for all U32_MAX-1 subchannels to appear and this is not
going to happen.

The immediate issue could be solved by adding num_sc_offered > 0 check to
netvsc_sc_open() but we're getting out of sync with the host and it's not
easy to adjust things later, e.g. in this particular case we'll be creating
queues without a user request for it and races are expected. Same applies
to other parts of the driver which have the same completion timeout.

Following the trend in drivers/hv/* code I suggest we remove all these
timeouts completely. As a guest we can always trust the host we're running
on and if the host screws things up there is no easy way to recover anyway.
