irqchip/mips-gic: Cleanup chip and handler setup

gic_shared_irq_domain_map() is called from gic_irq_domain_alloc() where
the wrong chip has been set, and is then overwritten. Tidy this up by
setting the correct chip the first time, and setting the
handle_level_irq handler from gic_irq_domain_alloc() too.

gic_shared_irq_domain_map() is also called from gic_irq_domain_map(),
which now calls irq_set_chip_and_handler() to retain its previous
behaviour.

This patch prepares for a follow-on which will call
gic_shared_irq_domain_map() from a callback where the lock on the struct
irq_desc is held, which without this change would cause the call to
irq_set_chip_and_handler() to lead to a deadlock.
