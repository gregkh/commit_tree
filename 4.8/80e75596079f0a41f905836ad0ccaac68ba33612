efi: Convert efi_call_virt() to efi_call_virt_pointer()

This commit makes a few slight modifications to the efi_call_virt() macro
to get it to work with function pointers that are stored in locations
other than efi.systab->runtime, and renames the macro to
efi_call_virt_pointer().  The majority of the changes here are to pull
these macros up into header files so that they can be accessed from
outside of drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c.

The most significant change not directly related to the code move is to
add an extra "p" argument into the appropriate efi_call macros, and use
that new argument in place of the, formerly hard-coded,
efi.systab->runtime pointer.

The last piece of the puzzle was to add an efi_call_virt() macro back into
drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c to wrap around the new
efi_call_virt_pointer() macro - this was mainly to keep the code from
looking too cluttered by adding a bunch of extra references to
efi.systab->runtime everywhere.

Note that I also broke up the code in the efi_call_virt_pointer() macro a
bit in the process of moving it.
