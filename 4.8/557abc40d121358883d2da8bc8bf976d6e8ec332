KVM: remove kvm_vcpu_compatible

The new created_vcpus field makes it possible to avoid the race between
irqchip and VCPU creation in a much nicer way; just check under kvm->lock
whether a VCPU has already been created.

We can then remove KVM_APIC_ARCHITECTURE too, because at this point the
symbol is only governing the default definition of kvm_vcpu_compatible.
