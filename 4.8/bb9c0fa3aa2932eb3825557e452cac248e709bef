net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Unwind errors in correct order

In case we cannot complete bcm_sf2_sw_setup() for any reason, and we
go to the out_unmap label, but the MDIO bus has not been registered yet,
we will hit the BUG condition in drivers/net/phy/mdio_bus.c about the
bus not being registered. Fix this by dedicating a specific lable for
when we fail after the MDIO bus has been successfully registered.
