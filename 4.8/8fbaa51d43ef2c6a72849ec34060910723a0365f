cxl: fix potential NULL dereference in free_adapter()

If kzalloc() fails when allocating adapter->guest in
cxl_guest_init_adapter(), we call free_adapter() before erroring out.
free_adapter() in turn attempts to dereference adapter->guest, which in
this case is NULL.

In free_adapter(), skip the adapter->guest cleanup if adapter->guest is
NULL.
