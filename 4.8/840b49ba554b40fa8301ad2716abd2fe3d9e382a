tools: Sync cpufeatures headers with the kernel

Due to:

  1e61f78baf89 ("x86/cpufeature: Make sure DISABLED/REQUIRED macros are updated")

No changes to tools using those headers (tools/arch/x86/lib/mem{set,cpu}_64.S)
seems necessary.

Detected by the tools build header drift checker:

  $ make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf
  make: Entering directory '/home/acme/git/linux/tools/perf'
    BUILD:   Doing 'make -j4' parallel build
