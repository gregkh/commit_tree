usb: dwc3: fix runtime PM in error path

If there is a failure after pm_runtime_enable/get_sync()
we need to call pm_runtime_disable/put_sync().

Otherwise it will lead to an unbalanced pm_runtime_enable() on the
subsequent probe if the earlier probe bailed out due to -EPROBE_DEFER.

pm_runtime_get_sync() can fail as well so deal with that case too.
