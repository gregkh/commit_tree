KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Fix L2 entry validation for indirect tables

When checking that the storage address of a device entry is valid,
it is critical to compute the actual address of the entry, rather
than relying on the beginning of the page to match a CPU page of
the same size: for example, if the guest places the table at the
last 64kB boundary of RAM, but RAM size isn't a multiple of 64kB...

Fix this by computing the actual offset of the device ID in the
L2 page, and check the corresponding GFN.
