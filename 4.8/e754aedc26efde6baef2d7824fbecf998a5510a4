x86/mpx, selftests: Add MPX self test

I've had this code for a while, but never submitted it upstream.  Now
that Skylake hardware is out in the wild, folks can actually run this
for real.  It tests the following:

	1. The MPX hardware is enabled by the kernel and doing what it
	   is supposed to
	2. The MPX management code is present and enabled in the kernel
	3. MPX Signal handling
	4. The MPX bounds table population code (on-demand population)
	5. The MPX bounds table unmapping code (kernel-initiated freeing
	   when unused)

This has also caught bugs in the XSAVE code because MPX state is
saved/restored with XSAVE.

I'm submitting it now because it would have caught the recent issues
with the compat_siginfo code not being properly augmented when new
siginfo state is added.
