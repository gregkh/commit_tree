target: Fix residual overflow handling in target_complete_cmd_with_length

This patch fixes residual overflow handling to correctly set the
residual_count using SPDTL, instead of SCSI Allocation Length.

Allocation Length is the maximum value of the SPDTL and not substitute
for it, hence it shouldnâ€™t be used to calculate ResidualCount except for
cases where SPDTL > Allocation Length and Data is truncated (in that
case both Alloc Len and SPDTL are same). (SPC 5r01 Section 4.2.5.6).

Thanks to Ajay Nair in assisting with this patch.
