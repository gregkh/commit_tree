quota: Ensure qids map to the filesystem

Introduce the helper qid_has_mapping and use it to ensure that the
quota system only considers qids that map to the filesystems
s_user_ns.

In practice for quota supporting filesystems today this is the exact
same check as qid_valid.  As only 0xffffffff aka (qid_t)-1 does not
map into init_user_ns.

Replace the qid_valid calls with qid_has_mapping as values come in
from userspace.  This is harmless today and it prepares the quota
system to work on filesystems with quotas but mounted by unprivileged
users.

Call qid_has_mapping from dqget.  This ensures the passed in qid has a
prepresentation on the underlying filesystem.  Previously this was
unnecessary as filesystesm never had qids that could not map.  With
the introduction of filesystems outside of s_user_ns this will not
remain true.

All of this ensures the quota code never has to deal with qids that
don't map to the underlying filesystem.
