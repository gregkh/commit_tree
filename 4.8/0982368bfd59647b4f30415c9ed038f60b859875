drbd: fix for truncated minor number in callback command line

The command line parameter the kernel module uses to communicate the
device minor to userland helper is flawed in a way that the device
indentifier "minor-%d" is being truncated to minors with a maximum
of 5 digits.

But DRBD 8.4 allows 2^20 == 1048576 minors,
thus a minimum of 7 digits must be supported.
