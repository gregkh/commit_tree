usb: gadget: m66592: fix unused-but-set-variable warnings

This patch fixes the following (W=1) warnings:

drivers/usb/gadget/udc/m66592-udc.c: In function ‘m66592_irq’:
drivers/usb/gadget/udc/m66592-udc.c:1203:15: warning: variable ‘nrdyenb’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  u16 brdyenb, nrdyenb, bempenb;
               ^
drivers/usb/gadget/udc/m66592-udc.c:1202:15: warning: variable ‘nrdysts’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  u16 brdysts, nrdysts, bempsts;
               ^

In doing so, it removes calls to m66592_read function which does I/O
with the device, but I hope the reads don’t have any side effects that
are needed.
