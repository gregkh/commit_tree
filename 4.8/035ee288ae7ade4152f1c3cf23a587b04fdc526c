PCI: Fix bridge_d3 update on device removal

Starting with v4.8, we allow a PCIe port to runtime suspend to D3hot if the
port itself and its children satisfy a number of conditions.  Once a child
is removed, we recheck those conditions in case the removed device was
blocking the port from suspending.

The rechecking needs to happen *after* the device has been removed from the
bus it resides on.  Otherwise when walking the port's subordinate bus in
pci_bridge_d3_update(), the device being removed would erroneously still be
taken into account.

However the device is removed from the bus_list in pci_destroy_dev() and we
currently recheck *before* that.  Fix it.
