nfit, tools/testing/nvdimm/: unify shutdown paths

While testing the new on-demand ARS patches we discovered that
differences between the nfit_test and normal nfit driver shutdown paths
can leak resources.  Unify the shutdown paths to trigger via a devm_
callback when the acpi_desc->dev is unbound from its driver.
