arm64, ACPI, NUMA: NUMA support based on SRAT and SLIT

Introduce a new file to hold ACPI based NUMA information parsing from
SRAT and SLIT.

SRAT includes the CPU ACPI ID to Proximity Domain mappings and memory
ranges to Proximity Domain mapping.  SLIT has the information of inter
node distances(relative number for access latency).
