raid10: improve random reads performance

RAID10 random read performance is lower than expected due to excessive spinlock
utilisation which is required mostly for rebuild/resync. Simplify allow_barrier
as it's in IO path and encounters a lot of unnecessary congestion.

As lower_barrier just takes a lock in order to decrement a counter, convert
counter (nr_pending) into atomic variable and remove the spin lock. There is
also a congestion for wake_up (it uses lock internally) so call it only when
it's really needed. As wake_up is not called constantly anymore, ensure process
waiting to raise a barrier is notified when there are no more waiting IOs.
