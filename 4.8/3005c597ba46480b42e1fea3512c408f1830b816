cpuidle/powernv: Add support for POWER ISA v3 idle states

POWER ISA v3 defines a new idle processor core mechanism. In summary,
 a) new instruction named stop is added.
 b) new per thread SPR named PSSCR is added which controls the behavior
	of stop instruction.

Supported idle states and value to be written to PSSCR register to enter
any idle state is exposed via ibm,cpu-idle-state-names and
ibm,cpu-idle-state-psscr respectively. To enter an idle state,
platform provided power_stop() needs to be invoked with the appropriate
PSSCR value.

This patch adds support for this new mechanism in cpuidle powernv driver.
