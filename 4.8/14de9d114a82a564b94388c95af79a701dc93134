virtio-net: Add initial MTU advice feature

This commit adds the feature bit and associated mtu device entry for the
virtio network device.  When a virtio device comes up, it checks the
feature bit for the VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU feature.  If such feature bit is
enabled, the driver will read the advised MTU and use it as the initial
value.
