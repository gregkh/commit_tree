md: don't print the same repeated messages about delayed sync operation

This fixes a long-standing bug that caused a flood of messages like:
"md: delaying data-check of md1 until md2 has finished (they share one
or more physical units)"

It can be reproduced like this:
1. Create at least 3 raid1 arrays on a pair of disks, each on different
   partitions.
2. Request a sync operation like 'check' or 'repair' on 2 arrays by
   writing to their md/sync_action attribute files. One operation should
   start and one should be delayed and a message like the above will be
   printed.
3. Issue a write to the third array. Each write will cause 2 copies of
   the message to be printed.

This happens when wake_up(&resync_wait) is called, usually by
md_check_recovery(). Then the delayed sync thread again prints the
message and is put to sleep. This patch adds a check in md_do_sync() to
prevent printing this message more than once for the same pair of
devices.
