gfs2: Lock holder cleanup

Make the code more readable by cleaning up the different ways of
initializing lock holders and checking for initialized lock holders:
mark lock holders as uninitialized by setting the holder's glock to NULL
(gfs2_holder_mark_uninitialized) instead of zeroing out the entire
object or using a separate flag.  Recognize initialized holders by their
non-NULL glock (gfs2_holder_initialized).  Don't zero out holder objects
which are immeditiately initialized via gfs2_holder_init or
gfs2_glock_nq_init.
