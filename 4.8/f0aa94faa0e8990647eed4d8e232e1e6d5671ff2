ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Set the DSP pipe type

DSP pipe type can be a pass through or it can be processing pipe.
In case of pass through pipe, it is a single pipeline with both
host and link copier in the same pipeline.

Identify the DSP pipe type if it pass through or not. Pass through
pipe is identified by checking if it has both host and link copier
in the same pipeline.
