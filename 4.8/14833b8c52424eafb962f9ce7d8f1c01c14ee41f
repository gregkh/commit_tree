IB/hfi1: Improve SDMA engine assignment for user SDMA

Currently each user context is assigned a single SDMA engine
based on the VL, context id, and subcontext id. That means for
MPI applications, each rank can only use one SDMA engine for
all messages. This may create unwanted backup for independent
messages going to different destinations upon congestion at one
destination.

This patch adds the packet "dlid" to the formula of SDMA engine
selection for user SDMA requests. A simple hash table is used
to maintain even distribution among the available SDMA engines
regardless how the "dlid" values are distributed.
