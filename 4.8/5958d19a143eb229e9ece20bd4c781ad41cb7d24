powerpc/pnv/pci: Fix incorrect PE reservation attempt on some 64-bit BARs

The generic allocation code may sometimes decide to assign a prefetchable
64-bit BAR to the M32 window. In fact it may also decide to allocate
a 64-bit non-prefetchable BAR to the M64 one ! So using the resource
flags as a test to decide which window was used for PE allocation is
just wrong and leads to insane PE numbers.

Instead, compare the addresses to figure it out.
