ovl: append MAY_READ when diluting write checks

Right now we remove MAY_WRITE/MAY_APPEND bits from mask if realfile is on
lower/. This is done as files on lower will never be written and will be
copied up. But to copy up a file, mounter should have MAY_READ permission
otherwise copy up will fail. So set MAY_READ in mask when MAY_WRITE is
reset.

Dan Walsh noticed this when he did access(lowerfile, W_OK) and it returned
True (context mounts) but when he tried to actually write to file, it
failed as mounter did not have permission on lower file.

[SzM] don't set MAY_READ if only MAY_APPEND is set without MAY_WRITE; this
won't trigger a copy-up.
