direct-io: use bio set/get op accessors

This patch has the dio code use a REQ_OP for the op and rq_flag_bits
for bi_rw flags. To set/get the op it uses the bio_set_op_attrs/bio_op
accssors.

It also begins to convert btrfs's dio_submit_t because of the dio
submit_io callout use. The next patches will completely convert
this code and the reset of the btrfs code paths.
