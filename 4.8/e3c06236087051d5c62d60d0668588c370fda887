cpufreq: add cpufreq_driver_resolve_freq()

Cpufreq governors may need to know what a particular target frequency
maps to in the driver without necessarily wanting to set the frequency.
Support this operation via a new cpufreq API,
cpufreq_driver_resolve_freq(). This API returns the lowest driver
frequency equal or greater than the target frequency
(CPUFREQ_RELATION_L), subject to any policy (min/max) or driver
limitations. The mapping is also cached in the policy so that a
subsequent fast_switch operation can avoid repeating the same lookup.

The API will call a new cpufreq driver callback, resolve_freq(), if it
has been registered by the driver. Otherwise the frequency is resolved
via cpufreq_frequency_table_target(). Rather than require ->target()
style drivers to provide a resolve_freq() callback it is left to the
caller to ensure that the driver implements this callback if necessary
to use cpufreq_driver_resolve_freq().
