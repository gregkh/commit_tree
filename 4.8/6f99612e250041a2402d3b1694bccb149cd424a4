tpm: Proxy driver for supporting multiple emulated TPMs

This patch implements a proxy driver for supporting multiple emulated TPMs
in a system.

The driver implements a device /dev/vtpmx that is used to created
a client device pair /dev/tpmX (e.g., /dev/tpm10) and a server side that
is accessed using a file descriptor returned by an ioctl.
The device /dev/tpmX is the usual TPM device created by the core TPM
driver. Applications or kernel subsystems can send TPM commands to it
and the corresponding server-side file descriptor receives these
commands and delivers them to an emulated TPM.

The driver retrievs the TPM 1.2 durations and timeouts. Since this requires
the startup of the TPM, we send a startup for TPM 1.2 as well as TPM 2.
