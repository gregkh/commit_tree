ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Create Pipe to widget list in soc probe

We need to Identify the DSP pipe type and based on it being a pass
thru pipeline or not, we need to copy the pipeline params.

Pipe to widget mapping was earlier done in pre PMD widget handler,
but since the pipe type would now be required in hw_params for
bypass pipelines we need to move this to be done during the ASoC
probe of the platform component.
