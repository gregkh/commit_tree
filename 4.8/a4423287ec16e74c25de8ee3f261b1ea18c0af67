dm raid: fix frozen recovery regression

On LVM2 conversions via lvconvert(8), the target keeps mapped devices in
frozen state when requesting RAID devices be resynchronized.  This
applies to e.g. adding legs to a raid1 device or taking over from raid0
to raid4 when the rebuild flag's set on the new raid1 legs or the added
dedicated parity stripe.

Also, fix frozen recovery for reshaping as well.
