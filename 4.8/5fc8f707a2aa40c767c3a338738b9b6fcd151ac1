intel_pstate: Fix MSR_CONFIG_TDP_x addressing in core_get_max_pstate()

If MSR_CONFIG_TDP_CONTROL is locked, we currently try to address some
MSR 0x80000648 or so. Mask out the relevant level bits 0 and 1.

Found while running over the Jailhouse hypervisor which became upset
about this strange MSR index.
