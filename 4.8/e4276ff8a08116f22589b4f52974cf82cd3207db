tty: serial: msm: Cleanup include usage

The hrtimer include isn't used and neither is serial. Drop those
ones. The irq.h header really should be interrupt.h because this
is an interrupt user and not an interrupt chip. Finally add
wait.h for the wake_up*() usage in this driver and kernel.h for
container_of().
