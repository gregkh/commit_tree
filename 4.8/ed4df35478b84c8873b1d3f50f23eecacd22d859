staging/lustre: Remove the "Please contact SUN for GPL" from headers

Since SUN is no longer around and there's no point in contacting them,
just remove that whole thing. Copy of GPL is available online anyway
(URLs to be updated in next patch).

This patch was generated with:
find drivers/staging/lustre -name "*.[ch]" -exec perl -0777 -i -pe 's/ \* Please contact Sun Microsystems, Inc., 4150 Network Circle, Santa Clara,\n \* CA 95054 USA or visit www.sun.com if you need additional information or\n \* have any questions.\n \*\n//igs' {} \;
