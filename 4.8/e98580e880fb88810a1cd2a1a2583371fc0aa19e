ARM: OMAP2+: timer: change order of hwmod data handling

With the introduction of hwmod module clocks, the name of the hwmod
main clk may not be available before hwmod setup, as hwmod setup
may lookup the main clock dynamically based on the hwmod name.
Thus, change the order of hwmod setup and main clock handling for
the timer code, to make sure the main clock is going to be
available.
