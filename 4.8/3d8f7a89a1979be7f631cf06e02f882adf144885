hwmon: (tmp102) Improve handling of initial read delay

If the chip was in shutdown mode when the driver was loaded, the first
conversion is ready no more than 35 milli-seconds after the chip was
taken out of shutdown. The driver delay was so far set to 333 ms (HZ / 3),
which is much higher than the maximum time needed by the chip.
Reduce the time to 35 milli-seconds.

Introduce a 'valid' flag to ensure that sensor data is actually read
even if requested less than 333 ms after the driver was loaded.
