mn10300: use RTC_DRV_CMOS instead of CONFIG_RTC

nn10300 has a dependency on mc146818_get_time/mc146818_set_time,
which we want to move from the mc146818rtc.h header into the
rtc subsystem, which in turn is not usable on mn10300.

This changes mn10300 to use the modern rtc-cmos driver instead
of the old RTC driver, and that in turn lets us completely
remove the read_persistent_clock/update_persistent_clock callbacks.
