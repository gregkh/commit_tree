jbd2: move lockdep instrumentation for jbd2 handles

The transaction the handle references is free to commit once we've
decremented t_updates counter. Move the lockdep instrumentation to that
place. Currently it was a bit later which did not really matter but
subsequent improvements to lockdep instrumentation would cause false
positives with it.
