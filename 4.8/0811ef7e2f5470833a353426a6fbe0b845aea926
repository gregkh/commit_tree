bus: arm-ccn: fix PMU interrupt flags

Currently the IRQ core is permitted to make the CCN PMU IRQ handler
threaded, and will allow userspace to change the CPU affinity of the
interrupt behind our back. Both of these could violate our
synchronisation requirements with the core perf code, which relies upon
strict CPU affinity and disabling of interrupts to guarantee mutual
exclusion in some cases.

As with the CPU PMU drivers, we should request the interrupt with
IRQF_NOBALANCING and IRQF_NO_THREAD, to avoid these issues.
