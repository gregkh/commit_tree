xen: introduce xen_vcpu_id mapping

It may happen that Xen's and Linux's ideas of vCPU id diverge. In
particular, when we crash on a secondary vCPU we may want to do kdump
and unlike plain kexec where we do migrate_to_reboot_cpu() we try
booting on the vCPU which crashed. This doesn't work very well for
PVHVM guests as we have a number of hypercalls where we pass vCPU id
as a parameter. These hypercalls either fail or do something
unexpected.

To solve the issue introduce percpu xen_vcpu_id mapping. ARM and PV
guests get direct mapping for now. Boot CPU for PVHVM guest gets its
id from CPUID. With secondary CPUs it is a bit more
trickier. Currently, we initialize IPI vectors before these CPUs boot
so we can't use CPUID. Use ACPI ids from MADT instead.
