tpm_crb: fix mapping of the buffers

On my Lenovo x250 the following situation occurs:

[18697.813871] tpm_crb MSFT0101:00: can't request region for resource
[mem 0xacdff080-0xacdfffff]

The mapping of the control area overlaps the mapping of the command
buffer. The control area is mapped over page, which is not right. It
should mapped over sizeof(struct crb_control_area).

Fixing this issue unmasks another issue. Command and response buffers
can overlap and they do interleave on this machine. According to the PTP
specification the overlapping means that they are mapped to the same
buffer.

The commit has been also on a Haswell NUC where things worked before
applying this fix so that the both code paths for response buffer
initialization are tested.
