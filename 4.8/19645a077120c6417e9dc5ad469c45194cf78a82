ntb_transport: Check the number of spads the hardware supports

I'm working on hardware that currently has a limited number of
scratchpad registers and ntb_ndev fails with no clue as to why. I
feel it is better to fail early and provide a reasonable error message
then to fail later on.

The same is done to ntb_perf, but it doesn't currently require enough
spads to actually fail. I've also removed the unused SPAD_MSG and
SPAD_ACK enums so that MAX_SPAD accurately reflects the number of
spads used.
