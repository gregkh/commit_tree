block: get rid of bio_rw and READA

These two are confusing leftover of the old world order, combining
values of the REQ_OP_ and REQ_ namespaces.  For callers that don't
special case we mostly just replace bi_rw with bio_data_dir or
op_is_write, except for the few cases where a switch over the REQ_OP_
values makes more sense.  Any check for READA is replaced with an
explicit check for REQ_RAHEAD.  Also remove the READA alias for
REQ_RAHEAD.
