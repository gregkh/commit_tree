doc-rst: linux_tv: remove trailing comments

The conversion script added some comments at the end.
They point to the original DocBook files, with will be
removed after the manual fixes. So, they'll be pointing
to nowere. So, remove those comments.

They'll be forever stored at the Kernel tree. So, if
someone wants the references, it is just a matter of
looking at the backlog.
