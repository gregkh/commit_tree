md/raid1, raid10: don't recheck "Faulty" flag in read-balance.

Re-checking the faulty flag here brings no value.
The comment about "risk" refers to the risk that the device could
be in the process of being removed by ->hot_remove_disk().
However providing that the ->nr_pending count is incremented inside
an rcu_read_locked() region, there is no risk of that happening.

This is because the rdev pointer (in the personalities array) is set
to NULL before synchronize_rcu(), and ->nr_pending is tested
afterwards.  If the rcu_read_locked region happens before the
synchronize_rcu(), the test will see that nr_pending has been incremented.
If it happens afterwards, the rdev pointer will be NULL so there is nothing
to increment.
