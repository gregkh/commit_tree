drm: Replace fb_helper->atomic with mode_config->atomic_commit

Drivers transitioning to atomic might not yet want to enable full
DRIVER_ATOMIC support when it's not entirely working. But using atomic
internally makes a lot more sense earlier.

Instead of spreading such flags to more places I figured it's simpler
to just check for mode_config->funcs->atomic_commit, and use atomic
paths if that is set. For the only driver currently transitioning
(i915) this does the right thing.
