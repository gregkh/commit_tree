ARM: dts: sun8i-h3: Rename sinovoip-bpi-m2-plus to bananapi-m2-plus

The Banana Pi series is a well known series of single board computers.
The manufacturer, Sinovoip, is less well known. Moreover, the board
markings do not mention Sinovoip, but only the Banana Pi logo, and
the BPI-M* model name.

Rename the dts file to use the more well known name. Also fix up
some of the model names and labels to match other Banana Pi boards.
