ubi: Be more paranoid while seaching for the most recent Fastmap

Since PEB erasure is asynchornous it can happen that there is
more than one Fastmap on the MTD. This is fine because the attach logic
will pick the Fastmap data structure with the highest sequence number.

On a not so well configured MTD stack spurious ECC errors are common.
Causes can be different, bad hardware, wrong operating modes, etc...
If the most current Fastmap renders bad due to ECC errors UBI might
pick an older Fastmap to attach from.
While this can only happen on an anyway broken setup it will show
completely different sympthoms and makes finding the root cause much
more difficult.
So, be debug friendly and fall back to scanning mode of we're facing
an ECC error while scanning for Fastmap.
