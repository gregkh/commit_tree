drm/i915: Silence "unexpected child device config size" for VBT on 845g

My old 845g complains that the child_device_size inside its VBT,
version 110, is incorrect. Let's fiddle with the version matching such
that it works with this VBT (i.e. treat BIOS v110 as having the same size
as v108).

Fixes [drm:intel_bios_init] *ERROR* Unexpected child device config
size 27 (expected 33 for VBT version 110)

Whether this is correct, no one knows - but it works for this particular
machine.
