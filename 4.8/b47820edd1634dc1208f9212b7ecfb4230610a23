ext4: avoid modifying checksum fields directly during checksum verification

We temporally change checksum fields in buffers of some types of
metadata into '0' for verifying the checksum values. By doing this
without locking the buffer, some metadata's checksums, which are
being committed or written back to the storage, could be damaged.
In our test, several metadata blocks were found with damaged metadata
checksum value during recovery process. When we only verify the
checksum value, we have to avoid modifying checksum fields directly.
