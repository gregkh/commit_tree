net/sched: flower: Return error when hw can't offload and skip_sw is set

When skip_sw is set and hardware fails to apply filter, return error to
user. This will make error propagation logic similar to the one
currently used in u32 classifier.
Also, changed code to use tc_skip_sw() utility function.
