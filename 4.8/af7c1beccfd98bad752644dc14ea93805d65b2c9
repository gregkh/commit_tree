virtio: mark vring_dma_dev() static

We get 1 warning when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/virtio/virtio_ring.c:170:16: warning: no previous prototype for 'vring_dma_dev' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, this function is only used in the file in which it is
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks this function with 'static'.
