asus-wmi: Add quirk_no_rfkill for the Asus Z550MA

The Asus Z550MA has an airplane-mode indicator LED and the WMI WLAN user
bit set, so asus-wmi uses ASUS_WMI_DEVID_WLAN_LED (0x00010002) to store
the wlan state, which has a side-effect of driving the airplane mode
indicator LED in an inverted fashion. quirk_no_rfkill prevents asus-wmi
from registering RFKill switches at all for this laptop and allows
asus-wireless to drive the LED through the ASHS ACPI device.
