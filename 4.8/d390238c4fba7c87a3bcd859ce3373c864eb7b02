net: dsa: initialize the routing table

The routing table of every switch in a tree is currently initialized to
all zeros. This is an issue since 0 is a valid port number.

Add a DSA_RTABLE_NONE=-1 constant to initialize the signed values of the
routing table pointing to other switches.

This fixes the device mapping of the mv88e6xxx driver where the port
pointing to the switch itself and to non-existent switches was wrongly
configured to be 0. It is now set to the expected 0xf value.
