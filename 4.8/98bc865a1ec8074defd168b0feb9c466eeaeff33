net: mdio-mux: Add MDIO mux driver for iProc SoCs

iProc based SoCs supports the integrated mdio multiplexer which
has the bus selection as well as mdio transaction generation logic
inside.

This multiplexer has child buses for PCIe, SATA, USB and ETH. These
buses could be internal or external to SOC where PHYs are attached.
These buses could use C-45 or C-22 mdio transaction.
