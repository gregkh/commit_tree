tools:iio:iio_generic_buffer: fix trigger-less mode

Passing the trigger-less mode option on the command line causes
iio_generic_buffer to fail searching for an IIO trigger.
Fix this by skipping trigger initialization if trigger-less mode is
requested.

Technically it actually fixes:
7c7e9dad70 where the bug was introduced but as the window to the patch
below that changes the context was very small let's mark it with that.
