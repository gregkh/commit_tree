drm: Update obsolete information from {enable/disable}_vblank hooks.

Since commit 4dfd64862ff8 ("drm: Use vblank timestamps to guesstimate
how many vblanks were missed"), the DRM framework can cope with devices
that don't have a hardware counter for vsync events without having
to keep the vsync interrupts enabled all the time. Drivers handling
such hardware should use drm_vblank_no_hw_counter() function for
their ->get_vblank_counter hook.
