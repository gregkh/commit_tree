arm64: include alternative handling in dcache_by_line_op

The newly introduced dcache_by_line_op macro is used at least in
one occassion at the moment to issue a "dc cvau" instruction,
which is affected by ARM errata 819472, 826319, 827319 and 824069.
Change the macro to allow for alternative patching in there to
protect affected Cortex-A53 cores.
