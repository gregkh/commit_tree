arm64: Add more test functions to insn.c

Certain instructions are hard to execute correctly out-of-line (as in
kprobes).  Test functions are added to insn.[hc] to identify these.  The
instructions include any that use PC-relative addressing, change the PC,
or change interrupt masking. For efficiency and simplicity test
functions are also added for small collections of related instructions.
