kdump: arrange for paddr_vmcoreinfo_note() to return phys_addr_t

On PAE systems (eg, ARM LPAE) the vmcore note may be located above 4GB
physical on 32-bit architectures, so we need a wider type than "unsigned
long" here.  Arrange for paddr_vmcoreinfo_note() to return a
phys_addr_t, thereby allowing it to be located above 4GB.

This makes no difference for kexec-tools, as they already assume a
64-bit type when reading from this file.
