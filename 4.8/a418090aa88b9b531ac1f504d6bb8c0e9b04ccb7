block: do not use REQ_FLUSH for tracking flush support

The last patch added a REQ_OP_FLUSH for request_fn drivers
and the next patch renames REQ_FLUSH to REQ_PREFLUSH which
will be used by file systems and make_request_fn drivers so
they can send a write/flush combo.

This patch drops xen's use of REQ_FLUSH to track if it supports
REQ_OP_FLUSH requests, so REQ_FLUSH can be deleted.
