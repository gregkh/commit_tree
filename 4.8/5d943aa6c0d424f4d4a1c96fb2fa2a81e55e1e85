drm: Consolidate crtc arrays in drm_atomic_state

It's silly to have 2 mallocs when we could tie these two together.

Also, Gustavo adds another one in his per-crtc out-fence patches. And
I want to add more stuff here for nonblocking commit helpers.

In the future we can use this to store a pointer to the preceeding
state, making an atomic update entirely free-standing. This will be
needed to be able to queue them up with a depth > 1.
