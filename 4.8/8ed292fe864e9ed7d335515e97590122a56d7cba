docs: deprecate kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt

Now that the new Sphinx world order is taking over, the information in
kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt is outmoded.  I hate to remove it altogether,
since it's one of those files that people expect to find.  But we can add a
warning and fix all the other pointers to it.
