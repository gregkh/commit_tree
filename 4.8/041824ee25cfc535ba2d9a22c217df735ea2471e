drm/i915/guc: enable GuC loading & submission by default

The recent patch
. fce91f2 drm/i915/guc: add enable_guc_loading parameter
enabled GuC loading and submission by default, but as issues
were found with warnings being issued during suspend-resume
cycles, GuC loading was disabled by default, by patch
. 2335986 drm/i915/guc: Disable automatic GuC firmware loading

Those warnings have been resolved, so this patch re-enables GuC
loading and submission by default.
