IB/core: Fix use after free in send_leave function

The function send_leave sets the member: group->query_id
(group->query_id = ret) after calling the sa_query, but leave_handler
can be executed before the setting and it might delete the group object,
and will get a memory corruption.

Additionally, this patch gets rid of group->query_id variable which is
not used.
