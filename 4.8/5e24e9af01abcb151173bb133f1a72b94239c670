Btrfs: error out if generic_bin_search get invalid arguments

With btrfs-corrupt-block, one can set btree node/leaf's field, if
we assign a negative value to node/leaf, we can get various hangs,
eg. if extent_root's nritems is -2ULL, then we get stuck in
 btrfs_read_block_groups() because it has a while loop and
btrfs_search_slot() on extent_root will always return the first
 child.

This lets us know what's happening and returns a EINVAL to callers
instead of returning the first item.
