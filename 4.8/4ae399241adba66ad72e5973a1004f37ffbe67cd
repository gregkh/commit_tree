ACPI: bus: add stub acpi_evaluate_dsm() to linux/acpi.h

acpi_evaluate_dsm() will be used to handle the _DSM method in ACPI case.
It will be compiled in non-ACPI case, but the function is in acpi_bus.h
and acpi_bus.h can only be used in ACPI case, so this patch add the stub
function to linux/acpi.h to make compiled successfully in non-ACPI cases.
