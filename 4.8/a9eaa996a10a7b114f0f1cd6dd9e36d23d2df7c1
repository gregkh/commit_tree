drm/doc: Spinx leftovers

This is unfortunately not all the sphinx noise when building the gpu
documentations. But the remaining warnings have completely bogus line
and probably also file sources, and I just can't find them.

Probably some serious debuggging of the line annotations in the
sphinx/kernel-doc toolchain needed first.
