mlxsw: spectrum_router: Add private neigh table

We need to hold some private data for every neigh entry. It would be
possible to do it using neigh_priv_len/ndo_neigh_construct/
ndo_neigh_destroy however only for the port device itself. That would not
work for stacked devices like bridge/team/bond. So introduce a private
neigh table. Hook onto ndos neigh_construct/destroy and add/remove
table entry according to that.
