printk: fix parsing of "brl=" option

Commit bbeddf52adc1 ("printk: move braille console support into separate
braille.[ch] files") moved the parsing of braille-related options into
_braille_console_setup(), changing the type of variable str from char*
to char**.  In this commit, memcmp(str, "brl,", 4) was correctly updated
to memcmp(*str, "brl,", 4) but not memcmp(str, "brl=", 4).

Update the code to make "brl=" option work again and replace memcmp()
with strncmp() to make the compiler able to detect such an issue.
