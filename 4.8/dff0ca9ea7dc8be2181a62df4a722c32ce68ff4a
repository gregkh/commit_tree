target: Fix ordered task target_setup_cmd_from_cdb exception hang

If a command with a Simple task attribute is failed due to a Unit
Attention, then a subsequent command with an Ordered task attribute
will hang forever.  The reason for this is that the Unit Attention
status is checked for in target_setup_cmd_from_cdb, before the call
to target_execute_cmd, which calls target_handle_task_attr, which
in turn increments dev->simple_cmds.

However, transport_generic_request_failure still calls
transport_complete_task_attr, which will decrement dev->simple_cmds.
In this case, simple_cmds is now -1.  So when a command with the
Ordered task attribute is sent, target_handle_task_attr sees that
dev->simple_cmds is not 0, so it decides it can't execute the
command until all the (nonexistent) Simple commands have completed.
