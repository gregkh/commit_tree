PM / QoS: avoid calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() during early boot

of_clk_init() ends up calling into pm_qos_update_request() very early
during boot where irq is expected to stay disabled.
pm_qos_update_request() uses cancel_delayed_work_sync() which
correctly assumes that irq is enabled on invocation and
unconditionally disables and re-enables it.

Gate cancel_delayed_work_sync() invocation with kevented_up() to avoid
enabling irq unexpectedly during early boot.
