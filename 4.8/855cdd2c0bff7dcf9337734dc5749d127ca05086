lightnvm: make rrpc_map_page call nvm_get_blk outside locks

The nvm_get_blk() function is called with rlun->lock held. This is ok
when the media manager implementation doesn't go out of its atomic
context. However, if a media manager persists its metadata, and
guarantees that the block is given to the target, this is no longer
a viable approach. Therefore, clean up the flow of rrpc_map_page,
and make sure that nvm_get_blk() is called without any locks acquired.
