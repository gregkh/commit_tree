irqchip/vic: Make vic_syscore_ops and vic_of_init static

The vic_syscore_ops and vic_of_init functions are not exported
outside the driver, so make them static to remove the following
warnings:

drivers/irqchip/irq-vic.c:170:20: warning: symbol 'vic_syscore_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/irqchip/irq-vic.c:520:12: warning: symbol 'vic_of_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
