tracing: Add trace_printk sample code

Add sample code to test trace_printk(). The trace_printk() functions should
never be used in production code. This makes testing it a bit more
difficult. Having a sample module that can test use cases of trace_printk()
can help out.

Currently it just tests trace_printk() where it will be converted into:

 trace_bputs()
 trace_puts()
 trace_bprintk()

as well as staying as the normal _trace_printk().

It also tests its use in interrupt context as that will test the auxilery
buffers.
