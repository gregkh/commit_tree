netfilter: conntrack: simplify early_drop

We don't need to acquire the bucket lock during early drop, we can
use lockless traveral just like ____nf_conntrack_find.

The timer deletion serves as synchronization point, if another cpu
attempts to evict same entry, only one will succeed with timer deletion.
