arm64: dts: fsl: Update address-cells and reg properties of cpu nodes

MPIDR_EL1[63:32] value is equal to 0 for the CPUs of the LS1043A and
LS2080A SoCs. The ARM CPU binding allows #address-cells to be set to 1,
since MPIDR_EL1[63:32] bits are not used for CPUs identification. Update
the #address-cells and reg properties accordingly.
