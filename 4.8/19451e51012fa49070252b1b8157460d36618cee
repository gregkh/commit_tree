MIPS: KVM: Use raw_cpu_has_fpu in kvm_mips_guest_can_have_fpu()

We need to use kvm_mips_guest_can_have_fpu() when deciding which
registers to list with KVM_GET_REG_LIST, however it causes warnings with
preemption since it uses cpu_has_fpu. KVM is only really supported on
CPUs which have symmetric FPUs, so switch to raw_cpu_has_fpu to avoid
the warning.
