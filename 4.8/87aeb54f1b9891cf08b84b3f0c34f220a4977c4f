kvm: x86: use getboottime64

KVM reads the current boottime value as a struct timespec in order to
calculate the guest wallclock time, resulting in an overflow in 2038
on 32-bit systems.

The data then gets passed as an unsigned 32-bit number to the guest,
and that in turn overflows in 2106.

We cannot do much about the second overflow, which affects both 32-bit
and 64-bit hosts, but we can ensure that they both behave the same
way and don't overflow until 2106, by using getboottime64() to read
a timespec64 value.
