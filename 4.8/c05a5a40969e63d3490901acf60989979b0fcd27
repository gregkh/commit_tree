powerpc/pseries: Dynamic add entires to associativity lookup array

Dynamically add entries to the associativity lookup array

The ibm,associativity-lookup-arrays property may only contain
associativity arrays for LMBs present at boot time. When hotplug
adding a LMB its associativity array may not be in the associativity
lookup array, this patch adds the ability to add new entries to the
associativity lookup array.
