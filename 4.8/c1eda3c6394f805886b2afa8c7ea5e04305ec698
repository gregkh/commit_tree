netfilter: nft_rbtree: ignore inactive matching element with no descendants

If we find a matching element that is inactive with no descendants, we
jump to the found label, then crash because of nul-dereference on the
left branch.

Fix this by checking that the element is active and not an interval end
and skipping the logic that only applies to the tree iteration.
