xfs: refactor btree maxlevels computation

Create a common function to calculate the maximum height of a per-AG
btree.  This will eventually be used by the rmapbt and refcountbt
code to calculate appropriate maxlevels values for each.  This is
important because the verifiers and the transaction block
reservations depend on accurate estimates of how many blocks are
needed to satisfy a btree split.

We were mistakenly using the max bnobt height for all the btrees,
which creates a dangerous situation since the larger records and
keys in an rmapbt make it very possible that the rmapbt will be
taller than the bnobt and so we can run out of transaction block
reservation.
