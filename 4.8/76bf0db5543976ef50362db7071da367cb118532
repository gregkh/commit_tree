dma-buf/fence: make fence context 64 bit v2

Fence contexts are created on the fly (for example) by the GPU scheduler used
in the amdgpu driver as a result of an userspace request. Because of this
userspace could in theory force a wrap around of the 32bit context number
if it doesn't behave well.

Avoid this by increasing the context number to 64bits. This way even when
userspace manages to allocate a billion contexts per second it takes more
than 500 years for the context number to wrap around.

v2: fix printf formats as well.
