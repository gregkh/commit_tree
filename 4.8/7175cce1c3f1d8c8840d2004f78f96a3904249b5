iio: adc: ti_am335x_adc: Increase timeout value waiting for ADC sample

Now that open delay and sample delay for each channel is configurable
via DT, the default IDLE_TIMEOUT value is not enough as this is
calculated based on hardcoded macros. This results in driver returning
EBUSY sometimes. Fix this by increasing the timeout
value based on maximum value possible to open delay and sample delays
for each channel.
