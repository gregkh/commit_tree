vfs: fix deadlock in file_remove_privs() on overlayfs

file_remove_privs() is called with inode lock on file_inode(), which
proceeds to calling notify_change() on file->f_path.dentry.  Which triggers
the WARN_ON_ONCE(!inode_is_locked(inode)) in addition to deadlocking later
when ovl_setattr tries to lock the underlying inode again.

Fix this mess by not mixing the layers, but doing everything on underlying
dentry/inode.
