can: bcm: add support for CAN FD frames

The programming API of the CAN_BCM depends on struct can_frame which is
given as array directly behind the bcm_msg_head structure. To follow this
schema for the CAN FD frames a new flag 'CAN_FD_FRAME' in the bcm_msg_head
flags indicates that the concatenated CAN frame structures behind the
bcm_msg_head are defined as struct canfd_frame.

This patch adds the support to handle CAN and CAN FD frames on a per BCM-op
base. Main changes:

- generally use struct canfd_frames instead if struct can_frames
- use canfd_frame.flags instead of can_frame.can_dlc for private BCM flags
- make all CAN frame sizes depending on the new CAN_FD_FRAME flags
- separate between CAN and CAN FD when sending/receiving frames

Due to the dependence of the CAN_FD_FRAME flag the former binary interface
for classic CAN frames remains stable.
