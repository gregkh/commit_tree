md: use seconds granularity for error logging

The md code stores the exact time of the last error in the
last_read_error variable using a timespec structure. It only
ever uses the seconds portion of that though, so we can
use a scalar for it.

There won't be an overflow in 2038 here, because it already
used monotonic time and 32-bit is enough for that, but I've
decided to use time64_t for consistency in the conversion.
