drm/i915: Refactor execlists default context pinning

Refactor pinning and unpinning of contexts, such that the default
context for an engine is pinned during initialisation and unpinned
during teardown (pinning of the context handles the reference counting).
Thus we can eliminate the special case handling of the default context
that was required to mask that it was not being pinned normally.

v2: Rebalance context_queue after rebasing.
v3: Rebase to -nightly (not 40 patches in)
v4: Rebase onto request_alloc unwinding
