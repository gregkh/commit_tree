futex: Assume all mappings are private on !MMU systems

To quote Rick why there is no need for shared mapping on !MMU systems:

|With MMU, shared futex keys need to identify the physical backing for
|a memory address because it may be mapped at different addresses in
|different processes (or even multiple times in the same process).
|Without MMU this cannot happen. You only have physical addresses. So
|the "private futex" behavior of using the virtual address as the key
|is always correct (for both shared and private cases) on nommu
|systems.

This patch disables the FLAGS_SHARED in a way that allows the compiler to
remove that code.
