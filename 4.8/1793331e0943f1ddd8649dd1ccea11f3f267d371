net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: remove rx_descs property

There is no reason in rx_descs property because davinici_cpdma
driver splits pool of descriptors equally between tx and rx channels.
That is, if number of descriptors 256, 128 of them are for rx
channels. While receiving, the descriptor is freed to the pool and
then allocated with new skb. And if in DT the "rx_descs" is set to
64, then 128 - 64 = 64 descriptors are always in the pool and cannot
be used, for tx, for instance. It's not correct resource usage,
better to set it to half of pool, then the rx pool can be used in
full. It will not have any impact on performance, as anyway, the
"redundant" descriptors were unused.
