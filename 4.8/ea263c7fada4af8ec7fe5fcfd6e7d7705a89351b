target: Fix max_unmap_lba_count calc overflow

max_discard_sectors only 32bits, and some non scsi backend
devices will set this to the max 0xffffffff, so we can end up
overflowing during the max_unmap_lba_count calculation.

This fixes a regression caused by my patch:

    target: Fix WRITE_SAME/DISCARD conversion to linux 512b sectors

which can result in extra discards being sent to due the overflow
causing max_unmap_lba_count to be smaller than what the backing
device can actually support.
