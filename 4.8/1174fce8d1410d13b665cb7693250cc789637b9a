net/mlx5e: Support l3/l4 flow type specs in ethtool flow steering

Add support to add flow steering rules with ethtool
of L3/L4 flow types (ip4/tcp4/udp4).
Those rules will be in higher priority than l2 flow rules, in order
to prefer more specific rules.

Mask is not supported for l3/l4 flow types.
