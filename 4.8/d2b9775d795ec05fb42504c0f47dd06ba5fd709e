serial: sh-sci: Correct pin initialization on (H)SCIF

Correct pin initialization on (H)SCIF:
  - RTS must be deasserted (it's active low),
  - SCK must be an input, as it may be used as the optional external
    clock input.

Initial pin configuration must always be done:
  - Regardless of the presence of dedicated RTS and CTS pins: if the
    register exists, the RTS/CTS bits exist, too,
  - Regardless of hardware flow control being enabled or not: RTS must
    be deasserted.
