staging/lustre/ptlrpc: lost bulk leads to a hang

The reverse order of request_out_callback() and reply_in_callback()
puts the RPC into UNREGISTERING state, which is waiting for RPC &
bulk md unlink, whereas only RPC md unlink has been called so far.
If bulk is lost, even expired_set does not check for UNREGISTERING
state.

The same for write if server returns an error.

This phase is ambiguous, split to UNREG_RPC and UNREG_BULK.
