drm/i915/guc: add enable_guc_loading parameter

Split the function of "enable_guc_submission" into two separate
options.  The new one ("enable_guc_loading") controls only the
*fetching and loading* of the GuC firmware image. The existing
one is redefined to control only the *use* of the GuC for batch
submission once the firmware is loaded.

In addition, the degree of control has been refined from a simple
bool to an integer key, allowing several options:
-1 (default)     whatever the platform default is
 0  DISABLE      don't load/use the GuC
 1  BEST EFFORT  try to load/use the GuC, fallback if not available
 2  REQUIRE      must load/use the GuC, else leave the GPU wedged

The new platform default (as coded here) will be to attempt to
load the GuC iff the device has a GuC that requires firmware,
but not yet to use it for submission. A later patch will change
to enable it if appropriate.

v4:
    Changed some error-message levels, mostly ERROR->INFO, per
    review comments by Tvrtko Ursulin.

v5:
    Dropped one more error message, disabled GuC submission on
    hypothetical firmware-free devices [Tvrtko Ursulin].

v6:
    Logging tidy by Tvrtko Ursulin:
     * Do not log falling back to execlists when wedging the GPU.
     * Do not log fw load errors when load was disabled by user.
     * Pass down some error code from fw load for log message to
       make more sense.
