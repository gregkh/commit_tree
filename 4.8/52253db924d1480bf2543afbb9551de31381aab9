sctp: also point GSO head_skb to the sk when it's available

The head skb for GSO packets won't travel through the inner depths of
SCTP stack as it doesn't contain any chunks on it. That means skb->sk
doesn't get set and then when sctp_recvmsg() calls
sctp_inet6_skb_msgname() on the head_skb it panics, as this last needs
to check flags at the socket (sp->v4mapped).

The fix is to initialize skb->sk for th head skb once we are able to do
it. That is, when the first chunk is processed.
