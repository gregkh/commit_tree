PCI: hv: Fix interrupt cleanup path

SR-IOV disabled from the host causes a memory leak.  pci-hyperv usually
first receives a PCI_EJECT notification and then proceeds to delete the
hpdev list entry in hv_eject_device_work().  Later in hv_msi_free() since
the device is no longer on the device list hpdev is NULL and hv_msi_free
returns without freeing int_desc as part of hv_int_desc_free().
