mmc: sdhci: Record what command is using the data lines

In order to support commands during data transfer, there must be a
distinction between the command that is using the command line (and
for which a command interrupt is expected) and the command that is
using the data lines (for which a data interrupt is expected).

There is host->cmd for the command line, but there is only host->data
for the data lines, which is a different structure, does not represent
the command in use, and is anyway NULL in the case of commands that use
the data lines for busy signalling instead of data transfer.

Introduce host->data_cmd to record what command is using the data lines,
and use that instead of host->cmd when referring to the data command.
