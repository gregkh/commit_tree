ceph: fix symbol versioning for ceph_monc_do_statfs

The genksyms helper in the kernel cannot parse a type definition
like "typeof(((type *)0)->keyfld)" that is used in the DEFINE_RB_FUNCS
helper, causing the following EXPORT_SYMBOL() statement to be ignored
when computing the crcs, and triggering a warning about this:

WARNING: "ceph_monc_do_statfs" [fs/ceph/ceph.ko] has no CRC

To work around the problem, we can rewrite the type to reference
an undefined 'extern' symbol instead of a NULL pointer. This is
evidently ok for genksyms, and it no longer complains about the
line when calling it with 'genksyms -w'.

I've looked briefly into extending genksyms instead, but it seems
really hard to do. Jan Beulich introduced basic support for 'typeof'
a while ago in dc53324060f3 ("genksyms: fix typeof() handling"),
but that is not sufficient for the expression we have here.
