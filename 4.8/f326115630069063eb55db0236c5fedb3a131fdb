drm/i915: Reject modeset if the dotclock is too high

Reject the modeset if the requested dotclock exceeds the maximum allowed
by the hardware. So far we've only checked this on gen2/3 while also
handling the double wide vs. single wide pipe selection. Extend the
check to all platforms since we have the max dotclock correctly
populated now across the board.
