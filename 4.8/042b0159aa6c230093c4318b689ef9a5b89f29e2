IB/hfi1: Handle kzalloc failure in init_pervl_scs

Checking the return value of the memory allocation call in
init_pervl_scs() was missed.  Recently the kmalloc() was changed to
kzalloc() which identified the problem.

While fixing this issue 2 other bugs were noticed.  First, the array
being allocated is accessed in the nomem path which can be reached before
it is allocated.  Second, kernel_send_context was not released on error.
Fix both of these by creating a more common memory unwind label structure.
