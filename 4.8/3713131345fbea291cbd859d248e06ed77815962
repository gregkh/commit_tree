KVM: x86: add KVM_CAP_X2APIC_API

KVM_CAP_X2APIC_API is a capability for features related to x2APIC
enablement.  KVM_X2APIC_API_32BIT_FORMAT feature can be enabled to
extend APIC ID in get/set ioctl and MSI addresses to 32 bits.
Both are needed to support x2APIC.

The feature has to be enableable and disabled by default, because
get/set ioctl shifted and truncated APIC ID to 8 bits by using a
non-standard protocol inspired by xAPIC and the change is not
backward-compatible.

Changes to MSI addresses follow the format used by interrupt remapping
unit.  The upper address word, that used to be 0, contains upper 24 bits
of the LAPIC address in its upper 24 bits.  Lower 8 bits are reserved as
0.  Using the upper address word is not backward-compatible either as we
didn't check that userspace zeroed the word.  Reserved bits are still
not explicitly checked, but non-zero data will affect LAPIC addresses,
which will cause a bug.
