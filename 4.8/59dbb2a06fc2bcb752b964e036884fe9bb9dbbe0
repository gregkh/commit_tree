relay: add global mode support for buffer-only channels

Commit 20d8b67c06fa ("relay: add buffer-only channels; useful for early
logging") added support to use channels with no associated files.

This is useful when the exact location of relay file is not known or the
the parent directory of relay file is not available, while creating the
channel and the logging has to start right from the boot.

But there was no provision to use global mode with buffer-only channels,
which is added by this patch, without modifying the interface where
initially there will be a dummy invocation of create_buf_file callback
through which kernel client can convey the need of a global buffer.

For the use case where drivers/kernel clients want a simple interface
for the userspace, which enables them to capture data/logs from relay
file inorder & without any post processing, support of Global buffer
mode is warranted.

Modules, like i915, using relay_open() in early init would have to later
register their buffer-only relays, once debugfs is available, by calling
relay_late_setup_files().  Hence relay_late_setup_files() symbol also
needs to be exported.
