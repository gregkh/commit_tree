xfs: implement iomap based buffered write path

Convert XFS to use the new iomap based multipage write path. This involves
implementing the ->iomap_begin and ->iomap_end methods, and switching the
buffered file write, page_mkwrite and xfs_iozero paths to the new iomap
helpers.

With this change __xfs_get_blocks will never be used for buffered writes,
and the code handling them can be removed.

Based on earlier code from Dave Chinner.
