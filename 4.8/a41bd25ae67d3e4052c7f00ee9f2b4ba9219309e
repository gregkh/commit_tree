sunrpc: fix UDP memory accounting

The commit f9b2ee714c5c ("SUNRPC: Move UDP receive data path
into a workqueue context"), as a side effect, moved the
skb_free_datagram() call outside the scope of the related socket
lock, but UDP sockets require such lock to be held for proper
memory accounting.
Fix it by replacing skb_free_datagram() with
skb_free_datagram_locked().
