sparc64: Fix cpu_possible_mask if nr_cpus is set

If kernel boot parameter nr_cpus is set, it should define the number
of CPUs that can ever be available in the system i.e.
cpu_possible_mask. setup_nr_cpu_ids() overrides the nr_cpu_ids based
on the cpu_possible_mask during kernel initialization. If
cpu_possible_mask is not set based on the nr_cpus value, earlier part
of the kernel would be initialized using nr_cpus value leading to a
kernel crash.

Set cpu_possible_mask based on nr_cpus value. Thus setup_nr_cpu_ids()
becomes redundant and does not corrupt nr_cpu_ids value.
