tcp: increase size at which tcp_bound_to_half_wnd bounds to > TCP_MSS_DEFAULT

In previous commit 01f83d69844d307be2aa6fea88b0e8fe5cbdb2f4
the following comments were added:

"When peer uses tiny windows, there is no use in packetizing to sub-MSS
pieces for the sake of SWS or making sure there are enough packets in
the pipe for fast recovery."

The test should be > TCP_MSS_DEFAULT not >= 512. This allows low end
devices that send an MSS of 536 (TCP_MSS_DEFAULT) to see better network
performance by sending it 536 bytes of data at a time instead of bounding
to half window size (268). Other network stacks work this way, e.g. HP-UX.
