mm, vmscan: make shrink_node decisions more node-centric

Earlier patches focused on having direct reclaim and kswapd use data
that is node-centric for reclaiming but shrink_node() itself still uses
too much zone information.  This patch removes unnecessary zone-based
information with the most important decision being whether to continue
reclaim or not.  Some memcg APIs are adjusted as a result even though
memcg itself still uses some zone information.
