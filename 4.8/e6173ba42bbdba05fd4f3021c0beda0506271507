lib/test_hash.c: fix warning in preprocessor symbol evaluation

Some versions of gcc don't like tests for the value of an undefined
preprocessor symbol, even in the #else branch of an #ifndef:

    lib/test_hash.c:224:7: warning: "HAVE_ARCH__HASH_32" is not defined [-Wundef]
     #elif HAVE_ARCH__HASH_32 != 1
	   ^
    lib/test_hash.c:229:7: warning: "HAVE_ARCH_HASH_32" is not defined [-Wundef]
     #elif HAVE_ARCH_HASH_32 != 1
	   ^
    lib/test_hash.c:234:7: warning: "HAVE_ARCH_HASH_64" is not defined [-Wundef]
     #elif HAVE_ARCH_HASH_64 != 1
	   ^

Seen with gcc 4.9, not seen with 4.1.2.

Change the logic to only check the value inside an #ifdef to fix this.
