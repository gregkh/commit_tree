ASoC: nau8825: fix bug in playback when suspend

In chromium, the following steps will make codec function fail.
\1. plug in headphones, Play music
\2. run "powerd_dbus_suspend"
\3. resume from S3
After resume, the jack detection will restart and make configuration
for the headset. Meanwhile, the playback prepares and starts to work.
The two sequences will conflict and make wrong register configuration.

Originally, the driver adds protection for the case when it finds
the playback is active. But the "powerd_dbus_suspend" command will
close the pcm stream before suspend. Therefore, the driver can't
detect the playback after resume, and the protection not works.
For the issue, the driver raises protection every time after resume.
The protection will release after jack detection and configuration
completes, and then the playback just will goes on.
