mfd: qcom_rpm: Parametrize also ack selector size

The RPM has two sets of selectors (IPC bit fields): request and
acknowledge. Apparently, some models use 4*32 bit words for select
and some use 7*32 bit words for request, but all use 7*32 words
for acknowledge bits.

So apparently you can on the models with requests of 4*32 select
bits send 4*32 messages and get 7*32 different replies, so on ACK
interrupt, 7*32 bit words need to be read. This is how the vendor
code apparently works.
