staging/android: remove .{fence, timeline}_value_str() from timeline_ops

Now that the value of fence and the timeline are not stored by sw_sync
anymore we can remove this extra abstraction to retrieve this data.

This patch changes both fence_ops (.fence_value_str and
.timeline_value_str) to return the str directly.

It also clean up struct sync_timeline_ops by removing both ops from there.
