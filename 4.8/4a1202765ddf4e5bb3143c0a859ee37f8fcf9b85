powerpc: Add module autoloading based on CPU features

This patch provides the necessary infrastructure to allow drivers
to be automatically loaded via udev. It implements the minimum
required to be able to use module_cpu_feature_match() to trigger
the GENERIC_CPU_AUTOPROBE mechanisms.

The features exposed are a mirror of the cpu_user_features
(converted to an offset from a mask). This decision was made to
ensure that the behavior between features for module loading and
userspace are consistent.
