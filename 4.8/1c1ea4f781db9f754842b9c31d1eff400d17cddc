Btrfs: fix memory leak of reloc_root

When some critical errors occur and FS would be flipped into RO,
if we have an on-going balance, we can end up with a memory leak
of root->reloc_root since btrfs_drop_snapshots() bails out
without freeing reloc_root at the very early start.

However, we're not able to free reloc_root in btrfs_drop_snapshots()
because its caller, merge_reloc_roots(), still needs to access it to
cleanup reloc_root's rbtree.

This makes us free reloc_root when we're going to free fs/file roots.
