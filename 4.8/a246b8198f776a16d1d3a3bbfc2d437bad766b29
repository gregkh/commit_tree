gpio: pca953x: Fix NBANK calculation for PCA9536

NBANK() macro assumes that ngpios is a multiple of 8(BANK_SZ) and
hence results in 0 banks for PCA9536 which has just 4 gpios. This is
wrong as PCA9356 has 1 bank with 4 gpios. This results in uninitialized
PCA953X_INVERT register. Fix this by using DIV_ROUND_UP macro in
NBANK().
