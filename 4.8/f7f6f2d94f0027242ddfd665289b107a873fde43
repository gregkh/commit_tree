arm64: KVM: report configured SRE value to 32-bit world

After commit b34f2bc ("arm64: KVM: Make ICC_SRE_EL1 access return the
configured SRE value") we report SRE value to 64-bit guest, but 32-bit
one still handled as RAZ/WI what leads to funny promise we do not keep:

"GICv3: GIC: unable to set SRE (disabled at EL2), panic ahead"

Instead, return the actual value of the ICC_SRE_EL1 register that the
guest should see.
