drm/i915: Apply lockdep annotations to i915_gem_context.c

Markup the functions that require the caller to hold struct_mutex with
lockdep_assert_held(). In the hopefully not-too-distant future we will
split the struct_mutex up, and in doing so we need to be sure that we
know what it protects - here the lockdep annotations are invaluable.
