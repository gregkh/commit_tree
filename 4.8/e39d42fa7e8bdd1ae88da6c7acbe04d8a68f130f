drm/i915: Stop tracking execlists retired requests

With the previous patch having extended the pinned lifetime of
contexts by referencing the previous context from the current
request until the latter is retired (completed by the GPU),
we can now remove usage of execlist retired queue entirely.

This is because the above now guarantees that all execlist
object access requirements are satisfied by this new tracking,
and we can stop taking additional references and stop keeping
request on the execlists retired queue.

The latter was a source of significant scalability issues in
the driver causing performance hits on some tests. Most
dramatical of which was igt/gem_close_race which had run time
in tens of minutes which is now reduced to tens of seconds.
