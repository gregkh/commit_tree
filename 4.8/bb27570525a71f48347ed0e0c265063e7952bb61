x86/platform/intel_mid_pci: Rework IRQ0 workaround

On Intel Merrifield platform several PCI devices have a bogus configuration,
i.e. the IRQ0 had been assigned to few of them. These are PCI root bridge,
eMMC0, HS UART common registers, PWM, and HDMI. The actual interrupt line can
be allocated to one device exclusively, in our case to eMMC0, the rest should
cope without it and basically known drivers for them are not using interrupt
line at all.

Rework IRQ0 workaround, which was previously done to avoid conflict between
eMMC0 and HS UART common registers, to behave differently based on the device
in question, i.e. allocate interrupt line to eMMC0, but silently skip interrupt
allocation for the rest except HS UART common registers which are not used
anyway. With this rework IOSF MBI driver in particular would be used.
