powerpc/mm: Parenthesise IS_ENABLED() in if condition

Currently IS_ENABLED() produces an expression surrounded by parentheses,
which allows this code to compile, generating eg:

    else if (1 || 0)
        hpte_init_native();

However a change to the macro in the kbuild tree will break this in
future by removing the parentheses.
