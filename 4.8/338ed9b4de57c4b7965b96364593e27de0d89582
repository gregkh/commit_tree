net_sched: sch_htb: export class backlog in dumps

We already get child qdisc qlen, we also can get its backlog
so that class dumps can report it.

Also replace qstats by a single drop counter, but move it in
a separate cache line so that drops do not dirty useful cache lines.

Tested:

$ tc -s cl sh dev eth0
class htb 1:1 root leaf 3: prio 0 rate 1Gbit ceil 1Gbit burst 500000b cburst 500000b
 Sent 2183346912 bytes 9021815 pkt (dropped 2340774, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
 rate 1001Mbit 517543pps backlog 120758b 499p requeues 0
 lended: 9021770 borrowed: 0 giants: 0
