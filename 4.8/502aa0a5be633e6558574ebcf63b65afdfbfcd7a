nfsd: fix dentry refcounting on create

b44061d0b9 introduced a dentry ref counting bug.  Previously we were
grabbing one ref to dchild in nfsd_create(), but with the creation of
nfsd_create_locked() we have a ref for dchild from the lookup in
nfsd_create(), and then another ref in nfsd_create_locked().  The ref
from the lookup in nfsd_create() is never dropped and results in
dentries still in use at unmount.
