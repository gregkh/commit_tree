i2c: brcmstb: Use complete() instead of complete_all()

There is only one waiter for the completion, therefore there
is no need to use complete_all(). Let's make that clear by
using complete() instead of complete_all().

The usage pattern of the completion is:

brcmstb_send_i2c_cmd()
  reinit_completion()
  ...
  /* initiate transfer by setting iic_enable */
  ...
  brcmstb_i2c_wait_for_completion()
