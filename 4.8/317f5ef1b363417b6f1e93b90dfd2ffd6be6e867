cxl: Add support for using the kernel API with a real PHB

This hooks up support for using the kernel API with a real PHB. After
the AFU initialisation has completed it calls into the PHB code to pass
it the AFU that will be used by other peer physical functions on the
adapter.

The cxl_pci_to_afu API is extended to work with peer PCI devices,
retrieving the peer AFU from the PHB. This API may also now return an
error if it is called on a PCI device that is not associated with either
a cxl vPHB or a peer PCI device to an AFU, and this error is propagated
down.
