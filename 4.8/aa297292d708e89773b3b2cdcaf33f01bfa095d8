x86/tsc: Enumerate SKL cpu_khz and tsc_khz via CPUID

Skylake CPU base-frequency and TSC frequency may differ
by up to 2%.

Enumerate CPU and TSC frequencies separately, allowing
cpu_khz and tsc_khz to differ.

The existing CPU frequency calibration mechanism is unchanged.
However, CPUID extensions are preferred, when available.

CPUID.0x16 is preferred over MSR and timer calibration
for CPU frequency discovery.

CPUID.0x15 takes precedence over CPU-frequency
for TSC frequency discovery.
