apparmor: fix refcount race when finding a child profile

When finding a child profile via an rcu critical section, the profile
may be put and scheduled for deletion after the child is found but
before its refcount is incremented.

Protect against this by repeating the lookup if the profiles refcount
is 0 and is one its way to deletion.
