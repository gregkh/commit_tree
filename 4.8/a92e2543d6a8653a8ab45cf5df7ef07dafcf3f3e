KVM: x86: use hardware-compatible format for APIC ID register

We currently always shift APIC ID as if APIC was in xAPIC mode.
x2APIC mode wants to use more bits and storing a hardware-compabible
value is the the sanest option.

KVM API to set the lapic expects that bottom 8 bits of APIC ID are in
top 8 bits of APIC_ID register, so the register needs to be shifted in
x2APIC mode.
