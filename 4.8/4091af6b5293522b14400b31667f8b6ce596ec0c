ARM: versatile: fix missing <plat/platsmp.h> include

Fix two missing function declarations by including the
<plat/platsmp.h> file where they are defined. Fixes:

arch/arm/plat-versatile/platsmp.c:35:6: warning: symbol 'versatile_secondary_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/arm/plat-versatile/platsmp.c:50:5: warning: symbol 'versatile_boot_secondary' was not declared. Should it be static?
