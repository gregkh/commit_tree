[media] lirc_dev: fix potential segfault

When opening or closing a lirc character device, the framework
provides to the user the possibility to keep track of opening or
closing of the device by calling two functions:

 - set_use_inc() when opening the device
 - set_use_dec() when closing the device

if those are not set by the lirc user, the system segfaults.
Check the pointer value before calling the above functions.
