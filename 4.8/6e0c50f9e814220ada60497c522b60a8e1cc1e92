cxl: Refine slice error debug messages

The PSL Slice Error Register (PSL_SERR_An) reports implementation
dependent AFU errors, in the form of a bitmap. The PSL_SERR_An
register content is printed in the form of hex dump debug message.

This patch decodes the PSL_ERR_An register contents, and prints a
specific error message for each possible error bit. It also dumps
the secondary registers AFU_ERR_An and PSL_DSISR_An, that may
contain extra debug information.

This patch also removes the large WARN message that used to report
the cxl slice error interrupt, and replaces it by a short informative
message, that draws attention to AFU implementation errors.
