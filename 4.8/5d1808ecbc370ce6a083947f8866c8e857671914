drm/i915: Assign every HW context a unique ID

The hardware tracks contexts and expects all live contexts (those active
on the hardware) to have a unique identifier. This is used by the
hardware to assign pagefaults and the like to a particular context.

v2: Reorder to make sure ctx->link is not left dangling if the
assignment of a hw_id fails (Mika).

v3: We have 21bits of context space, not 20.
