tracing: Expose CPU physical addresses (resource values) for PCI devices

Previously, mmio_print_pcidev() put "user" addresses in the trace buffer.
On most architectures, these are the same as CPU physical addresses, but on
microblaze, mips, powerpc, and sparc, they may be something else, typically
a raw BAR value (a bus address as opposed to a CPU address).

Always expose the CPU physical address to avoid this arch-dependent
behavior.

This change should have no user-visible effect because this file currently
depends on CONFIG_HAVE_MMIOTRACE_SUPPORT, which is only defined for x86,
and pci_resource_to_user() is a no-op on x86.
