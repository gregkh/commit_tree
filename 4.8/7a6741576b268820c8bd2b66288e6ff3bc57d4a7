s390/mm: protection exceptions are corrrectly shadowed

As gmap shadows contains correct protection permissions, protection
exceptons can directly be forwarded to guest 3. If we would encounter
a protection exception while faulting, the next guest 3 run will
automatically handle that for us.

Keep the dat_protection logic in place, as it will be helpful later.
