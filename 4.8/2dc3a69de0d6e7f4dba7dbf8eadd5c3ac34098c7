xprtrdma: Remove ALLPHYSICAL memory registration mode

No HCA or RNIC in the kernel tree requires the use of ALLPHYSICAL.

ALLPHYSICAL advertises in the clear on the network fabric an R_key
that is good for all of the client's memory. No known exploit
exists, but theoretically any user on the server can use that R_key
on the client's QP to read or update any part of the client's memory.

ALLPHYSICAL exposes the client to server bugs, including:
 o base/bounds errors causing data outside the i/o buffer to be
   accessed
 o RDMA access after reply causing data corruption and/or integrity
   fail

ALLPHYSICAL can't protect application memory regions from server
update after a local signal or soft timeout has terminated an RPC.

ALLPHYSICAL chunks are no larger than a page. Special cases to
handle small chunks and long chunk lists have been a source of
implementation complexity and bugs.
