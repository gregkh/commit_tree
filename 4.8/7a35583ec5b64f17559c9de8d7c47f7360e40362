mlxsw: spectrum: Don't return upon error in removal path

When removing a VLAN filter from the device we shouldn't return upon the
first error we encounter, as otherwise we'll have resources that will
never be freed nor used.

Instead, we should keep trying to free as much resources as possible in
a best effort mode.

Remove the error message as well, since we already get these from the
EMAD transaction code.
