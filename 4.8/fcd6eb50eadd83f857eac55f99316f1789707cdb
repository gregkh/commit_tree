Input: add powerkey driver for HISI 65xx SoC

This driver provides a input driver for the power button on the
HiSi 65xx SoC for boards like HiKey.

This driver was originally by Zhiliang Xue <xuezhiliang@huawei.com>
then basically rewritten by Jorge, but preserving the original
module author credits.
