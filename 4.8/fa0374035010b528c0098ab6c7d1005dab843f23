[media] media: rcar-vin: pad-aware driver initialisation

Add detection of source pad number for drivers aware of the media controller
API, so that rcar-vin can create device nodes to support modern drivers such
as adv7604.c (for HDMI on Lager) and the converted adv7180.c (for composite)
underneath.

Building rcar_vin gains a dependency on CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER, in
line with requirements for building the drivers associated with it.
