xhci: use and add separate function for checking for link trbs

Add a new is_link_trb() function that only checks for link trbs.
We want to split generic last_trb() function which is used for both
event rings without link trbs, and endpoint and command rings with links.

This will allow us to easier check for link trbs added mid segments.
