can: rcar_canfd: Add back-to-error-active support

As per Wolfgang G, all new drivers should support decreasing state
transition(back-to-error-active). This patch adds this support.

This driver configures the controller to halt on bus-off entry. Hence,
when in error states less than bus off state, the TEC/REC counters
are checked for lower state transition eligibility and action.
