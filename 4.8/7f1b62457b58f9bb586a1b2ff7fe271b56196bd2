xfs: fix type confusion in xfs_ioc_swapext

When calling fdget() in xfs_ioc_swapext(), we need to verify that
the file descriptors passed into the ioctl point to XFS inodes
before we start operations on them. If we don't do this, we could be
referencing arbitrary kernel memory as an XFS inode. THis could lead
to memory corruption and/or performing locking operations on
attacker-chosen structures in kernel memory.
