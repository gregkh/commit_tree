ARM: 8600/1: Enforce some NS-SVC initialisation

Since the non-secure copies of banked registers lack architecturally
defined reset values, there is no actual guarantee when entering in Hyp
from secure-only firmware that the Non-Secure PL1 state will look the
way that kernel entry (in particular the decompressor stub) expects.
So far, we've been getting away with it thanks to implementation details
of ARMv7 cores and/or bootloader behaviour, but for the sake of forwards
compatibility let's try to ensure that we have a minimally sane state
before dropping down into it.
