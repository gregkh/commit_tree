net: Don't delete routes in different VRFs

When deleting an IP address from an interface, there is a clean-up of
routes which refer to this local address. However, there was no check to
see that the VRF matched. This meant that deletion wasn't confined to
the VRF it should have been.

To solve this, a new field has been added to fib_info to hold a table
id. When removing fib entries corresponding to a local ip address, this
table id is also used in the comparison.

The table id is populated when the fib_info is created. This was already
done in some places, but not in ip_rt_ioctl(). This has now been fixed.
