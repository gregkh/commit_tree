mm, compaction: don't isolate PageWriteback pages in MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT mode

At present MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT is allowing __isolate_lru_page() to
isolate a PageWriteback page, which __unmap_and_move() then rejects with
-EBUSY: of course the writeback might complete in between, but that's
not what we usually expect, so probably better not to isolate it.

When tested by stress-highalloc from mmtests, this has reduced the
number of page migrate failures by 60-70%.
