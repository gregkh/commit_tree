net/mlx5e: Add TC drop and mirred/redirect action parsing for SRIOV offloads

Add the setup code that parses the TC actions needed to support offloading drop
and mirred/redirect for SRIOV e-switch. We can redirect between two devices if
they belong to the same HW switch, compare the switchdev HW ID attribute to
enforce that.
