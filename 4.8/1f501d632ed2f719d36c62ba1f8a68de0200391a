clk: meson: make gxbb explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/clk/meson/Kconfig:config COMMON_CLK_GXBB
drivers/clk/meson/Kconfig:      bool

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE and ALIAS are no-op for non-modules.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
