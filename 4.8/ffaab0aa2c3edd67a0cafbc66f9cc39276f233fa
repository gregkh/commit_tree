ACPI / PCI: make pci_slot explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this file is:

drivers/acpi/Kconfig:config ACPI_PCI_SLOT
drivers/acpi/Kconfig:   bool "PCI slot detection driver"

...and so it is not built as a module.  Hence including module.h
and everything that comes with it just for the no-op MODULE_LICENSE
and friends is rather heavy handed.

The license/author info is found at the top of the file, so we
just remove the MODULE_LICENSE etc and the include of module.h

We delete the DRIVER_VERSION macro as well since it is unused.
