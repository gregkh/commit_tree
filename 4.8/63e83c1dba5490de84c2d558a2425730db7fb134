drm: Consolidate connector arrays in drm_atomic_state

It's kinda pointless to have 2 separate mallocs for these. And when we
add more per-connector state in the future it's even more pointless.

Right now there's no such thing planned, but both Gustavo's per-crtc
fence patches, and some nonblocking commit helpers I'm playing around
with will add more per-crtc stuff. It makes sense to also consolidate
connectors, just for consistency.

In the future we can use this to store a pointer to the preceeding
state, making an atomic update entirely free-standing. This will be
needed to be able to queue them up with a depth > 1.
