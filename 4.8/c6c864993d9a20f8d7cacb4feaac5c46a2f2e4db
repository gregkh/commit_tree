Revert "gpio: include <linux/io-mapping.h> in gpiolib-of"

This reverts commit 7d4defe21c682c934a19fce1ba8b54b7bde61b08.

The commit was pointless, manically trembling in the dark for
a solution. The real fixes are:

commit 048c28c91e56
("gpio: make any OF dependent driver depend on OF_GPIO")
commit 2527ecc9195e
("gpio: Fix OF build problem on UM")
