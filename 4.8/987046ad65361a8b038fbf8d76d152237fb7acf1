drm/i915: Unify intel_ring_begin()

Combine the near identical implementations of intel_logical_ring_begin()
and intel_ring_begin() - the only difference is that the logical wait
has to check for a matching ring (which is assumed by legacy).

In the process some debug messages are culled as there were following a
WARN if we hit an actual error.
