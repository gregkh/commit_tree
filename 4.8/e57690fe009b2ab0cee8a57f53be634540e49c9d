blk-mq: don't overwrite rq->mq_ctx

We do this in a few places, if the CPU is offline. This isn't allowed,
though, since on multi queue hardware, we can't just move a request
from one software queue to another, if they map to different hardware
queues. The request and tag isn't valid on another hardware queue.

This can happen if plugging races with CPU offlining. But it does
no harm, since it can only happen in the window where we are
currently busy freezing the queue and flushing IO, in preparation
for redoing the software <-> hardware queue mappings.
