s390/dasd: fix hanging device after clear subchannel

When a device is in a status where CIO has killed all I/O by itself the
interrupt for a clear request may not contain an irb to determine the
clear function. Instead it contains an error pointer -EIO.
This was ignored by the DASD int_handler leading to a hanging device
waiting for a clear interrupt.

Handle -EIO error pointer correctly for requests that are clear pending and
treat the clear as successful.
