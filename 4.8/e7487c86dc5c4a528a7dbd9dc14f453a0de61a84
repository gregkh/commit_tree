sctp: avoid identifying address family many times for a chunk

Identifying address family operations during rx path is not something
expensive but it's ugly to the eye to have it done multiple times,
specially when we already validated it during initial rx processing.

This patch takes advantage of the now shared sctp_input_cb and make the
pointer to the operations readily available.
