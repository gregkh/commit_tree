dm raid: introduce extended superblock and new raid types to support takeover/reshaping

Add new members to the dm-raid superblock and new raid types to support
takeover/reshape.

Add all necessary members needed to support takeover and reshape in one
go -- aiming to limit the amount of changes to the superblock layout.

This is a larger patch due to the new superblock members, their related
flags, validation of both and involved API additions/changes:

 - add additional members to keep track of:
   - state about forward/backward reshaping
   - reshape position
   - new level, layout, stripe size and delta disks
   - data offset to current and new data for out-of-place reshapes
   - failed devices bitfield extensions to keep track of max raid devices

 - adjust super_validate() to cope with new superblock members

 - adjust super_init_validation() to cope with new superblock members

 - add definitions for ctr flags supporting delta disks etc.

 - add new raid types (raid6_n_6 etc.)

 - add new raid10 supporting function API (_is_raid10_*())

 - adjust to changed raid10 supporting function API
