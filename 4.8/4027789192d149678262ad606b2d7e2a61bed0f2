s390/time: LPAR offset handling

It is possible to specify a user offset for the TOD clock, e.g. +2 hours.
The TOD clock will carry this offset even if the clock is synchronized
with STP. This makes the time stamps acquired with get_sync_clock()
useless as another LPAR migth use a different TOD offset.

Use the PTFF instrution to get the TOD epoch difference and subtract
it from the TOD clock value to get a physical timestamp. As the epoch
difference contains the sync check delta as well the LPAR offset value
to the physical clock needs to be refreshed after each clock
synchronization.
