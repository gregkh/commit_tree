drm/i915/guc: replace assign_doorbell() with select_doorbell_register()

This version doesn't update the doorbell bitmap, as that will
be done when the selected doorbell is associated with a client.

The call is now slightly earlier, just on the general principle
that potentially-failing operations should be done as early as
possible, to eliminate late failures and simplify recovery.
