mm: bail out in shrink_inactive_list()

With node-lru, if there are enough reclaimable pages in highmem but
nothing in lowmem, VM can try to shrink inactive list although the
requested zone is lowmem.

The problem is that if the inactive list is full of highmem pages then a
direct reclaimer searching for a lowmem page waste CPU scanning
uselessly.  It just burns out CPU.  Even, many direct reclaimers are
stalled by too_many_isolated if lots of parallel reclaimer are going on
although there are no reclaimable memory in inactive list.

I tried the experiment 4 times in 32bit 2G 8 CPU KVM machine to get
elapsed time.
