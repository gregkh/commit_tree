IB/mlx5: Report mlx5 TSO capabilities when querying device

Enable mlx5 based hardware to report TCP segmentation offload (TSO)
capabilities from kernel to user space. A TSO enabled NIC will accept
big chunks of data with sizes greater than MTU for TCP traffic.  The TSO
engine will break the data into separate packets and will insert headers
automatically.

The capabilities are exposed to user space through query_device by uhw
directly. The following capabilities are reported:

1. The maximum payload size in bytes supported for segmentation by TSO
   engine.
2. Bitmap showing which QP types are supported by TSO operation. The bitmap
   is built by members from 'enmu ib_qp_type'. For example, similar code
   should be performed if UD QP is supported:
	supported_qpts |= 1 << IB_QPT_UD;

To make user-space library aware of whether kernel supports uhw or not, a
new flag: cmds_supp_uhw will be returned back to user-space through
alloc_ucontext.
