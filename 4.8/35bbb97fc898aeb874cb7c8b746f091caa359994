btrfs: don't create or leak aliased root while cleaning up orphans

commit 909c3a22da3 (Btrfs: fix loading of orphan roots leading to BUG_ON)
avoids the BUG_ON but can add an aliased root to the dead_roots list or
leak the root.

Since we've already been loading roots into the radix tree, we should
use it before looking the root up on disk.
