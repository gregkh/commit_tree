thp: handle file COW faults

File COW for THP is handled on pte level: just split the pmd.

It's not clear how benefitial would be allocation of huge pages on COW
faults.  And it would require some code to make them work.

I think at some point we can consider teaching khugepaged to collapse
pages in COW mappings, but allocating huge on fault is probably
overkill.
