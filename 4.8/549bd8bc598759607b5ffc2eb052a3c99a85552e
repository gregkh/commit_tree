crypto: talitos - Implement AEAD for SEC1 using HMAC_SNOOP_NO_AFEU

This patchs enhances the IPSEC_ESP related functions for them to
also supports the same operations with descriptor type
HMAC_SNOOP_NO_AFEU.

The differences between the two descriptor types are:
* pointeurs 2 and 3 are swaped (Confidentiality key and
    Primary EU Context IN)
* HMAC_SNOOP_NO_AFEU has CICV out in pointer 6
* HMAC_SNOOP_NO_AFEU has no primary EU context out so we get it
from the end of data out
