mm: balloon: use general non-lru movable page feature

Now, VM has a feature to migrate non-lru movable pages so balloon
doesn't need custom migration hooks in migrate.c and compaction.c.

Instead, this patch implements the page->mapping->a_ops->
{isolate|migrate|putback} functions.

With that, we could remove hooks for ballooning in general migration
functions and make balloon compaction simple.

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: compaction.h requires that the includer first include node.h]
