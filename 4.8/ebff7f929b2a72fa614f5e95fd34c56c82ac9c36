scripts/kernel-doc: Remove duplicated DOC: start handling

Further up in the state machinery we switch from STATE_NAME to
STATE_DOCBLOCK when we match /$doc_block/. Which means this block of
code here is entirely unreachable, unless there are multiple DOC:
sections within a single kernel-doc comment.

Getting a list of all the files with more than one DOC: section using

$ git grep -c " * DOC:" | grep -v ":1$"

and then doing a full audit of them reveals there are no such comment
blocks in the kernel.

Supporting multiple DOC: sections in a single kernel-doc comment does
not seem like a recommended way of doing things anyway, so nuke the code
for simplicity.
