drm/i915: Report command parser version 0 if disabled

If the command parser is not active, then it is appropriate to report it
as operating at version 0 as no higher mode is supported. This greatly
simplifies userspace querying for the command parser as we then do not
need to second guess when it will be active (a mixture of module
parameters and generational support, which may change over time).
