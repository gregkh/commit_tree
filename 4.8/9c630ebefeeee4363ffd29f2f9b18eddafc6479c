ovl: simplify permission checking

The fact that we always do permission checking on the overlay inode and
clear MAY_WRITE for checking access to the lower inode allows cruft to be
removed from ovl_permission().

1) "default_permissions" option effectively did generic_permission() on the
overlay inode with i_mode, i_uid and i_gid updated from underlying
filesystem.  This is what we do by default now.  It did the update using
vfs_getattr() but that's only needed if the underlying filesystem can
change (which is not allowed).  We may later introduce a "paranoia_mode"
that verifies that mode/uid/gid are not changed.

2) splitting out the IS_RDONLY() check from inode_permission() also becomes
unnecessary once we remove the MAY_WRITE from the lower inode check.
