drm/i915: Split idling from forcing context switch

We only need to force a switch to the kernel context placeholder during
eviction. All other uses of i915_gpu_idle() just want to wait until
existing work on the GPU is idle. Rename i915_gpu_idle() to
i915_gem_wait_for_idle() to avoid any implications about "parking" the
context first.

v2: Tweak an error message if the wait fails for the ilk vtd w/a
