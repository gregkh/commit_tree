kernel-doc/rst: change the output layout

Move away from field lists, and simply use **strong emphasis** for
section headings on lines of their own. Do not use rst section headings,
because their nesting depth depends on the surrounding context, which
kernel-doc has no knowledge of. Also, they do not need to end up in any
table of contexts or indexes.

There are two related immediate benefits. Field lists are typically
rendered in two columns, while the new style uses the horizontal width
better. With no extra indent on the left, there's no need to be as fussy
about it. Field lists are more susceptible to indentation problems than
the new style.
