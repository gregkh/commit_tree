kvm: vmx: hook preemption timer support

Hook the VMX preemption timer to the "hv timer" functionality added
by the previous patch.  This includes: checking if the feature is
supported, if the feature is broken on the CPU, the hooks to
setup/clean the VMX preemption timer, arming the timer on vmentry
and handling the vmexit.

A module parameter states if the VMX preemption timer should be
utilized.

[Move hv_deadline_tsc to struct vcpu_vmx, use -1 as the "unset" value.
 Put all VMX bits here.  Enable it by default #yolo. - Paolo]
