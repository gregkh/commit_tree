i2c: meson: Use complete() instead of complete_all()

There is only one waiter for the completion, therefore there
is no need to use complete_all(). Let's make that clear by
using complete() instead of complete_all().

The usage pattern of the completion is:

meson_i2c_xfer_msg()
  reinit_completion()
  ...
  /* Start the transfer */
  ...
  wait_for_completion_timeout()
