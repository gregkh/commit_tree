net: ethernet: mediatek: fix runtime warning raised by inconsistent struct device pointers passed to DMA API

Runtime warning occurs if DMA-API debug feature is enabled that would be
raised by pointers passed to DMA API as arguments to inconsistent struct
device objects, so that the patch makes them usage aligned between DMA
operations such as dma_map_*() and dma_unmap_*() to eliminate the warning.
