mm/page_owner: initialize page owner without holding the zone lock

It's not necessary to initialized page_owner with holding the zone lock.
It would cause more contention on the zone lock although it's not a big
problem since it is just debug feature.  But, it is better than before
so do it.  This is also preparation step to use stackdepot in page owner
feature.  Stackdepot allocates new pages when there is no reserved space
and holding the zone lock in this case will cause deadlock.
