Revert "tty/serial/8250: use mctrl_gpio helpers"

Serial console is broken in v4.8-rcX. Mika and I independently bisected down to
commit 4ef03d328769 ("tty/serial/8250: use mctrl_gpio helpers").

Since neither author nor anyone else didn't propose a solution we better revert
it for now.

This reverts commit 4ef03d328769eddbfeca1f1c958fdb181a69c341.
