usb: dwc3: host: Fix broken XHCI host

Looks like we lost all changes related to
commit 9522def40065 ("usb: dwc3: core: cleanup IRQ resources") in host.c
when Felipe's next branch was merged into Greg's next branch.

Fixes 215db948181 ("Merge tag 'usb-for-v4.8' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/balbi/usb into usb-next")
