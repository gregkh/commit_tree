ath10k: fix cycle counter wraparound handling for QCA4019

In QCA4019, cycle counter wraparound is not tied to rx
clear counter. Each counter would wraparound individually
and after wraparound the respective counter will be reset
to 0x7fffffff while other counter still running unaffected.
Define a new wraparound type for this behaviour and handle
it separately so that rx clear counter wraparound is also
handled just like cycle counter. With this type of
wraparound we can accurately compute and report channel
active/busy time when any of the counter overflows.
