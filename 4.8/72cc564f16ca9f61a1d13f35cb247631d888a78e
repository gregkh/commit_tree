sh: fix futex/robust_list on nommu models

The futex cmpxchg runtime testing in kernel/futex.c depends on
accesses to address 0 producing EFAULT, which obviously does not work
on nommu. Since SH always has cmpxchg, disable the broken runtime
detection.

At some point this should be fixed at the kernel/futex.c level. UP
machines can always provide a working cmpxchg with interrupt masking,
and SMP cannot function without a working cmpxchg anyway.
