drivers/perf: arm-pmu: convert arm_pmu_mutex to spinlock

arm_pmu_mutex is never held long and we don't want to sleep while the
lock is being held as it's executed in the context of hotplug notifiers.
So it can be converted to a simple spinlock instead.

Without this patch we get the following warning:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:620

This patch converts the mutex to spinlock to eliminate the above
warnings. This constraints pmu->reset to be non-blocking call which is
the case with all the ARM PMU backends.
