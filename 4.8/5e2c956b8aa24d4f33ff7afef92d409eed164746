target: Fix missing complete during ABORT_TASK + CMD_T_FABRIC_STOP

During transport_generic_free_cmd() with a concurrent TMR
ABORT_TASK and shutdown CMD_T_FABRIC_STOP bit set, the
caller will be blocked on se_cmd->cmd_wait_stop completion
until the final kref_put() -> target_release_cmd_kref()
has been invoked to call complete().

However, when ABORT_TASK is completed with FUNCTION_COMPLETE
in core_tmr_abort_task(), the aborted se_cmd will have already
been removed from se_sess->sess_cmd_list via list_del_init().

This results in target_release_cmd_kref() hitting the
legacy list_empty() == true check, invoking ->release_cmd()
but skipping complete() to wakeup se_cmd->cmd_wait_stop
blocked earlier in transport_generic_free_cmd() code.

To address this bug, it's safe to go ahead and drop the
original list_empty() check so that fabric_stop invokes
the complete() as expected, since list_del_init() can
safely be used on a empty list.
