drm/i915: Introduce & use new lightweight SGL iterators

The existing for_each_sg_page() iterator is somewhat heavyweight, and is
limiting i915 driver performance in a few benchmarks. So here we
introduce somewhat lighter weight iterators, primarily for use with GEM
objects or other case where we need only deal with whole aligned pages.

Unlike the old iterator, the new iterators use an internal state
structure which is not intended to be accessed by the caller; instead
each takes as a parameter an output variable which is set before each
iteration. This makes them particularly simple to use :)

One of the new iterators provides the caller with the DMA address of
each page in turn; the other provides the 'struct page' pointer required
by many memory management operations.

Various uses of for_each_sg_page() are then converted to the new macros.

v2: Force inlining of the sg_iter constructor and make the union
anonymous.
