regulator: pwm: Switch to the atomic PWM API

Use the atomic API wherever appropriate and get rid of pwm_apply_args()
call (the reference period and polarity are now explicitly set when
calling pwm_apply_state()).

We also make use of the pwm_set_relative_duty_cycle() helper to ease
relative to absolute duty_cycle conversion.

Note that changes introduced by commit fd786fb0276a ("regulator: pwm:
Try to avoid voltage error in duty cycle calculation") are no longer
needed because pwm_set_relative_duty_cycle() takes care of all rounding
approximation for us.
