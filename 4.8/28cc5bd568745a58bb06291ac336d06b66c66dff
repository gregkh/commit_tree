MIPS: KVM: Use kmap instead of CKSEG0ADDR()

There are several unportable uses of CKSEG0ADDR() in MIPS KVM, which
implicitly assume that a host physical address will be in the low 512MB
of the physical address space (accessible in KSeg0). These assumptions
don't hold for highmem or on 64-bit kernels.

When interpreting the guest physical address when reading or overwriting
a trapping instruction, use kmap_atomic() to get a usable virtual
address to access guest memory, which is portable to 64-bit and highmem
kernels.
