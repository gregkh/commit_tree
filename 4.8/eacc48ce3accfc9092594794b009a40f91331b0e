hwmon: (jc42) Add I2C_CLASS_HWMON to detection class

In 2011, commit 774466add7c ("hwmon: (jc42) Change detection class")
changed the detection class of these chips to I2C_CLASS_SPD based
on this premise: "makes more sense because these chips always live on
memory modules"

Today these chips have applications beyond memory modules. Examples are
JC42.4 compatible chips such as MCP9804 and MCP9808, but also MCP9805,
which is marked as JC42.4 compliant and suggested for use not only for
DIMMS, but also as generic temperature sensor.

Add I2C_CLASS_HWMON as an additional detection class to allow detection
by hwmon class i2c adapters.
