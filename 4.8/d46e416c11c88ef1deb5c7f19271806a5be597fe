sctp: sctp should change socket state when shutdown is received

Now sctp doesn't change socket state upon shutdown reception. It changes
just the assoc state, even though it's a TCP-style socket.

For some cases, if we really need to check sk->sk_state, it's necessary to
fix this issue, at least when we use ss or netstat to dump, we can get a
more exact information.

As an improvement, we will change sk->sk_state when we change asoc->state
to SHUTDOWN_RECEIVED, and also do it in sctp_shutdown to keep consistent
with sctp_close.
