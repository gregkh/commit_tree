drm/i915: Add background commentary to "waitboosting"

Describe the intent of boosting the GPU frequency to maximum before
waiting on the GPU.

RPS waitboosting was introduced with commit b29c19b64528 ("drm/i915:
Boost RPS frequency for CPU stalls") but lacked a concise comment in the
code to explain itself.
