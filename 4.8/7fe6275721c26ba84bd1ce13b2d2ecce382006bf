drm/i915: Program BXT_CDCLK_CD2X_PIPE

BXT could change the CD2X divider synchronized with a single pipe.
So assuming the DE PLL frequency doesn't need to be changed, we could
change cdclk without shutting off the pipe (when only a single pipe is
enabled). In the meantime let's configure CDCLK_CTL for non-double
buffered CD2X update, although it shouldn't really matter as long as
the selected pipe is disabled when reprogramming the divider.
