tools lib bpf: Copy bpf.h and bpf_common.h from the kernel

To allow the build to complete on older systems, where those files are
either not uptodate, lacking some recent additions or not present at
all.

And check if the copy drifts from the kernel, as in this synthetic test:

    BUILD:   Doing 'make -j4' parallel build
  Warning: tools/include/linux/bpf.h differs from kernel
  Warning: tools/include/linux/bpf_common.h differs from kernel
