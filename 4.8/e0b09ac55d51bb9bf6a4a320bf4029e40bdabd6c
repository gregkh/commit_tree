IB/hfi1: Make the cache handler own its rb tree root

The objects which use cache handling should reference their own handler
object not the internal data structure it uses to track the nodes.

Have the "users" of the mmu notifier code pass opaque objects which can
then be properly used in the mmu callbacks depending on the owners needs.

This patch has the additional benefit that operations no longer require a
look up in a list to find the handlers.
