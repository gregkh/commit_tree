ASoC: dapm: support user-defined stop condition in dai_get_connected_widgets

Certain situations may warrant examining DAPM paths only to a certain
arbitrary point, as opposed to always following them to the end. For
instance, when establishing a connection between a front-end DAI link
and a back-end DAI link in a DPCM path, it does not make sense to walk
the DAPM graph beyond the first widget associated with a back-end link.

This patch introduces a mechanism which lets a user of
dai_get_connected_widgets supply a function which will be called for
every node during the graph walk. When invoked, this function can
execute arbitrary logic to decide whether the walk, given a DAPM widget
and walk direction, should be terminated at that point or continued
as normal.
