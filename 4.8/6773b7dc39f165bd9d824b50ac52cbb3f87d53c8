VSOCK: defer sock removal to transports

The virtio transport will implement graceful shutdown and the related
SO_LINGER socket option.  This requires orphaning the sock but keeping
it in the table of connections after .release().

This patch adds the vsock_remove_sock() function and leaves it up to the
transport when to remove the sock.
