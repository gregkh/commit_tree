scsi: wd7000: print sector number as 64-bit

Enabling format checking in dprintk() shows that wd7000_biosparam uses
an incorrect format string for sector_t:

drivers/scsi/wd7000.c: In function 'wd7000_biosparam':
drivers/scsi/wd7000.c:1594:21: error: format '%d' expects argument of type 'int', but argument 3 has type 'sector_t {aka long long unsigned int}' [-Werror=format=]

As sector_t can be 32-bit wide, this adds a cast to 'u64' and prints
that with the correct format. The change to use no_printk() generally
helps with finding this kind of hidden format string bug, and I found
that when building with "-Wextra", which warned about an empty else
clause in

       } else
              dprintk("ok!\n");
