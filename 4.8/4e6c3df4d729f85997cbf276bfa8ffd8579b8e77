crypto: skcipher - Add low-level skcipher interface

This patch allows skcipher algorithms and instances to be created
and registered with the crypto API.  They are accessible through
the top-level skcipher interface, along with ablkcipher/blkcipher
algorithms and instances.

This patch also introduces a new parameter called chunk size
which is meant for ciphers such as CTR and CTS which ostensibly
can handle arbitrary lengths, but still behave like block ciphers
in that you can only process a partial block at the very end.

For these ciphers the block size will continue to be set to 1
as it is now while the chunk size will be set to the underlying
block size.
