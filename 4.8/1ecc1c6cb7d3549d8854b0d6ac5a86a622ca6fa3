drm/i915/dsi: CABC support for Panel PWM backlight control

In CABC (Content Adaptive Brightness Control) content grey level
scale can be increased while simultaneously decreasing
brightness of the backlight to achieve same perceived brightness.

The CABC is not standardized and panel vendors are free to follow
their implementation. The CABC implementaion here assumes that the
panels use standard SW register for control.

CABC is supported only when the PWM source for backlight is
from the panel.

v2 by Jani: rebase, renames, check cabc support earlier, etc.
