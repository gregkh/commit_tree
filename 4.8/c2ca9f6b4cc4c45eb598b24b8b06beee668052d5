powerpc/powernv: Fix pci-cxl.c build when CONFIG_MODULES=n

pnv_cxl_enable_phb_kernel_api() grabs a reference to the cxl module to
prevent it from being unloaded after the PHB has been switched to CX4
mode. This breaks the build when CONFIG_MODULES=n as module_mutex
doesn't exist.

However, if we don't have modules, we don't need to protect against the
case of the cxl module being unloaded. As such, split the relevant code
out into a function surrounded with #if IS_MODULE(CXL) so we don't try
to compile it if cxl isn't being compiled as a module.
