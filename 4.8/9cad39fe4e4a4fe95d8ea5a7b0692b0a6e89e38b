usb: dwc3: fix for the isoc transfer EP_BUSY flag

commit f3af36511e60 ("usb: dwc3: gadget: always
enable IOC on bulk/interrupt transfers") ended up
regressing Isochronous endpoints by clearing
DWC3_EP_BUSY flag too early, which resulted in
choppy audio playback over USB.

Fix that by partially reverting original commit and
making sure that we check for isochronous endpoints.
