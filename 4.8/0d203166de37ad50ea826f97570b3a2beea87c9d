perf tools: Bail out at "--sort dcacheline" and cacheline_size not known

There are cases where further work would be needed to overcome the fact
that neither sysconf(_SC_LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE) nor
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/coherency_line_size are
available in some systems (Android, for instance), so bail out when such
a situation takes place.
