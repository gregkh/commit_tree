drm/i915/gen9: Propagate watermark calculation failures up the call chain

Once we move watermark calculation to the atomic check phase, we'll want
to start rejecting display configurations that exceed out watermark
limits.  At the moment we just assume that there's always a valid set of
watermarks, even though this may not actually be true.  Let's prepare by
passing return codes up through the call stack in preparation.
