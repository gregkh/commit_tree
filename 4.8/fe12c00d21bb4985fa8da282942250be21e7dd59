PM / hibernate: Introduce test_resume mode for hibernation

test_resume mode is to verify if the snapshot data
written to swap device can be successfully restored
to memory. It is useful to ease the debugging process
on hibernation, since this mode can not only bypass
the BIOSes/bootloader, but also the system re-initialization.

To avoid the risk to break the filesystm on persistent storage,
this patch resumes the image with tasks frozen.

For example:
echo test_resume > /sys/power/disk
echo disk > /sys/power/state
