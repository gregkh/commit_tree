perf evlist: Setup backward mmap state machine

Introduce a bkw_mmap_state state machine to evlist:

                     .________________(forbid)_____________.
                     |                                     V
 NOTREADY --(0)--> RUNNING --(1)--> DATA_PENDING --(2)--> EMPTY
                     ^  ^              |   ^               |
                     |  |__(forbid)____/   |___(forbid)___/|
                     |                                     |
                      \_________________(3)_______________/

 NOTREADY     : Backward ring buffers are not ready
 RUNNING      : Backward ring buffers are recording
 DATA_PENDING : We are required to collect data from backward ring buffers
 EMPTY        : We have collected data from backward ring buffers.

 (0): Setup backward ring buffer
 (1): Pause ring buffers for reading
 (2): Read from ring buffers
 (3): Resume ring buffers for recording

We can't avoid this complexity. Since we deliberately drop records from
overwritable ring buffer, there's no way for us to check remaining from
ring buffer itself (by checking head and old pointers). Therefore, we
need DATA_PENDING and EMPTY state to help us recording what we have done
to the ring buffer.

In record__mmap_read_evlist(), drive this state machine from DATA_PENDING
to EMPTY.

In perf_evlist__mmap_per_evsel(), drive this state machine from NOTREADY
to RUNNING when creating backward mmap.
