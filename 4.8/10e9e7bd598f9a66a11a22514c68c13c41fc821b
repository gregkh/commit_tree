perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix uncore num_counters

Some uncore boxes' num_counters value for Haswell server and
Broadwell server are not correct (too large, off by one).

This issue was found by comparing the code with the document. Although
there is no bug report from users yet, accessing non-existent counters
is dangerous and the behavior is undefined: it may cause miscounting or
even crashes.

This patch makes them consistent with the uncore document.
