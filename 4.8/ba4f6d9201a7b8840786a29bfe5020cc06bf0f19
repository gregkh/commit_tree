PCI: altera: Simplify host bridge window iteration

The switch is the only statement in the resource_list_for_each_entry()
loop, so remove unnecessary "continue" statements in the switch.  Simplify
checking for the required non-prefetchable memory aperture.  Inline
altera_pcie_release_of_pci_ranges(), which is only called once.

No functional change intended.
