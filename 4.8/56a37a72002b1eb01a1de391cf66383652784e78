asus-wmi: Add quirk_no_rfkill_wapf4 for the Asus X456UA

The Asus X456UA has an airplane-mode indicator LED and the WMI WLAN user
bit set, so asus-wmi uses ASUS_WMI_DEVID_WLAN_LED (0x00010002) to store
the wlan state, which has a side-effect of driving the airplane mode
indicator LED in an inverted fashion.

quirk_no_rfkill prevents asus-wmi from registering RFKill switches at
all for this laptop and allows asus-wireless to drive the LED through
the ASHS ACPI device.  This laptop already has a quirk for setting
WAPF=4, so use quirk_no_rfkill_wapf4, which both disables rfkill and
sets WAPF=4.
