IB/hfi1: Modify the default number of kernel receive conexts

Currently, the default number of kernel receive contexts is set to the
number of NUMA nodes on the system plus one for control context. However,
the systems that have a single socket and/or have NUMA disabled in the BIOS
will have only one receive context by default. This patch would ensure that
by default there will be at least two kernel receive contexts plus one for
control context regardless of the number of NUMA nodes on the system. The
user can override the default number of kernel receive contexts with the
krcvqs module parameter.
