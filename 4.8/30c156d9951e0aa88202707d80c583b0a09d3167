libceph: rados pool namespace support

Add pool namesapce pointer to struct ceph_file_layout and struct
ceph_object_locator. Pool namespace is used by when mapping object
to PG, it's also used when composing OSD request.

The namespace pointer in struct ceph_file_layout is RCU protected.
So libceph can read namespace without taking lock.
