radix-tree: fix comment about "exceptional" bits

The bottom two bits of radix tree entries are reserved for special use
by the radix tree code itself.  A comment detailing their usage was
added by commit 3bcadd6fa6c4 ("radix-tree: free up the bottom bit of
exceptional entries for reuse")

This comment states that if the bottom two bits are '11', this means
that this is a locked exceptional entry.

It turns out that this bit combination was never actually used.  Radix
tree locking for DAX was indeed implemented, but it actually used the
third LSB:

  /* We use lowest available exceptional entry bit for locking */
  #define RADIX_DAX_ENTRY_LOCK (1 << RADIX_TREE_EXCEPTIONAL_SHIFT)

This locking code was also made specific to the DAX code instead of
being generally implemented in radix-tree.h.

So, fix the comment.
