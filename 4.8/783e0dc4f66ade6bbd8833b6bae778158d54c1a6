qla2xxx: Check for device state before unloading the driver.

During hot swap of PCI device, there can be PCI error on device,
during normal driver unload. The race between normal driver unload and
driver unload due to PCI error, can lead to system crash.Fix is to check
if there is unload going on and allow that function to unload the driver.
