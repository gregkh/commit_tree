NFS: Don't drop CB requests with invalid principals

Before commit 778be232a207 ("NFS do not find client in NFSv4
pg_authenticate"), the Linux callback server replied with
RPC_AUTH_ERROR / RPC_AUTH_BADCRED, instead of dropping the CB
request. Let's restore that behavior so the server has a chance to
do something useful about it, and provide a warning that helps
admins correct the problem.
