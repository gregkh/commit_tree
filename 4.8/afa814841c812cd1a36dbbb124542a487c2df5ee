iio: adc: ad7793: claim direct mode when writing frequency

Driver was checking for direct mode and trying to lock it, but
left a gap where mode could change before the desired operation.
Use iio_device_claim_direct_mode() to guarantee device stays in
direct mode.

Refactor function to clarify look-up followed by lock sequence.
