nvdimm: fix PHYS_PFN/PFN_PHYS mixup

nd_activate_region() iomaps any hint addresses required when activating
a region. To prevent duplicate mappings it checks the PFN of the hint to
be mapped against the PFNs of the already mapped hints. Unfortunately it
doesn't convert the PFN back into a physical address before passing it
to devm_nvdimm_ioremap(). Instead it applies PHYS_PFN a second time
which ends about as well as you would imagine.
