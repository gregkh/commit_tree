powerpc: cputhreads: Add missing include file

Powerpc builds may fail with the following build error.

Error log:
In file included from ./arch/powerpc/include/asm/mmu_context.h:11:0,
                 from ./include/linux/mmu_context.h:4,
		 from mm/mmu_context.c:8:
./arch/powerpc/include/asm/cputhreads.h: In function 'get_tensr':
./arch/powerpc/include/asm/cputhreads.h:101:2: error:
	implicit declaration of function 'cpu_has_feature'

The problem can be triggered by configuring ppc64e_defconfig and selecting
CONFIG_TICK_CPU_ACCOUNTING instead of CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE.
