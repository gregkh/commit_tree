Add sancov plugin

The sancov gcc plugin inserts a __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() call
at the start of basic blocks.

This plugin is a helper plugin for the kcov feature. It supports
all gcc versions with plugin support (from gcc-4.5 on).
It is based on the gcc commit "Add fuzzing coverage support" by Dmitry Vyukov
(https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc?limit_changes=0&view=revision&revision=231296).
