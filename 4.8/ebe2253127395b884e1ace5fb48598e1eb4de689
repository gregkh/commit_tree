powerpc/powernv: Support PCI slot ID

The reset and poll functionality from (OPAL) firmware supports
PHB and PCI slot at same time. They are identified by ID. This
supports PCI slot ID by:

   * Rename the argument name for opal_pci_reset() and opal_pci_poll()
     accordingly
   * Rename pnv_eeh_phb_poll() to pnv_eeh_poll() and adjust its argument
     name.
   * One macro is added to produce PCI slot ID.
