xfs: add an extent to the rmap btree

Originally-From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Now all the btree, free space and transaction infrastructure is in
place, we can finally add the code to insert reverse mappings to the
rmap btree. Freeing will be done in a separate patch, so just the
addition operation can be focussed on here.

[darrick: handle owner offsets when adding rmaps]
[dchinner: remove remaining debug printk statements]
[darrick: move unwritten bit to rm_offset]
