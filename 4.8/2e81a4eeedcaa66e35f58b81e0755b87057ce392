ext4: avoid deadlock when expanding inode size

When we need to move xattrs into external xattr block, we call
ext4_xattr_block_set() from ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea(). That may end
up calling ext4_mark_inode_dirty() again which will recurse back into
the inode expansion code leading to deadlocks.

Protect from recursion using EXT4_STATE_NO_EXPAND inode flag and move
its management into ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea() since its manipulation
is safe there (due to xattr_sem) from possible races with
ext4_xattr_set_handle() which plays with it as well.
