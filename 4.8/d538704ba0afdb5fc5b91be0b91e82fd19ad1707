drm/i915: Move get-reset-stats ioctl from intel_uncore.c to i915_gem_context.c

The get-reset-stats ioctl reports upon the statistics (number of hangs,
be it as a victim or the guilty party) of a particular context. It is
semantically better as being part of i915_gem_context.c user interface,
as opposed to the hardware level access of intel_uncore.c
