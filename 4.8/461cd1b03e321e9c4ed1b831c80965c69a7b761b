net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Register our slave MDIO bus

Register a slave MDIO bus which allows us to divert problematic
read/writes towards conflicting pseudo-PHY address (30). Do no longer
rely on DSA's slave_mii_bus, but instead provide our own implementation
which offers more flexibility as to what to do, and when to register it.

We need to register it by the time we are able to get access to our
memory mapped registers, which is not until drv->setup() time. In order
to avoid forward declarations, we need to re-order the function bodies a
bit.
