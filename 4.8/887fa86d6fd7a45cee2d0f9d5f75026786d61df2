perf hists: Trim libtraceevent trace_seq buffers

When we use libtraceevent to format trace event fields into printable
strings to use in hist entries it is important to trim it from the
default 4 KiB it starts with to what is really used, to reduce the
memory footprint, so use realloc(seq.buffer, seq.len + 1) when returning
the seq.buffer formatted with the fields contents.
