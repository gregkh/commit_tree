ipv6: Don't unset flowi6_proto in ipxip6_tnl_xmit()

Commit 8eb30be0352d0916 ("ipv6: Create ip6_tnl_xmit") unsets
flowi6_proto in ip4ip6_tnl_xmit() and ip6ip6_tnl_xmit().
Since xfrm_selector_match() relies on this info, IPv6 packets
sent by an ip6tunnel cannot be properly selected by their
protocols after removing it. This patch puts flowi6_proto back.
