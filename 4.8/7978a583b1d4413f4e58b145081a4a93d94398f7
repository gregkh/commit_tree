dmaengine: sirf: fix un-exported struct warnings

The sirfsoc_dmadata structs are not used outside the driver, so
remove build warnings by making them static. Fixes:

drivers/dma/sirf-dma.c:1129:24: warning: symbol 'sirfsoc_dmadata_a6' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/dma/sirf-dma.c:1134:24: warning: symbol 'sirfsoc_dmadata_a7v1' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/dma/sirf-dma.c:1139:24: warning: symbol 'sirfsoc_dmadata_a7v2' was not declared. Should it be static?
