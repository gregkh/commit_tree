spi: s3c64xx: add Exynos5433 compatible for ioclk handling

The new compatible is related to the Samsung Exynos5433 SoC. The
difference between the previous is that in the exynos5433 the SPI
controller is driven by three clocks instead of only one.

The new clock (ioclk) is controlling the input/output clock
whenever the controller is slave or master.

The presence of the clock line is detected from the compatibility
structure (exynos5433_spi_port_config) as a boolean value.

The probe function checks whether the ioclk is present and if so,
it acquires.

The runtime suspend and resume functions will handle the clock
enabling and disabling as well.
