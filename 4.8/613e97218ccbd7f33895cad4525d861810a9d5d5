device property: Add function to search for named child of device

For device nodes in both DT and ACPI, it possible to have named
child nodes which contain properties (an existing example being
gpio-leds). This adds a function to find a named child node for
a device which can be used by drivers for property retrieval.

For DT data node name matching, of_node_cmp() and similar functions
are made available outside of CONFIG_OF block so the new function
can reference these for DT and non-DT builds.

For ACPI data node name matching, a helper function is also added
which returns false if CONFIG_ACPI is not set, otherwise it
performs a string comparison on the data node name. This avoids
using the acpi_data_node struct for non CONFIG_ACPI builds,
which would otherwise cause a build failure.
