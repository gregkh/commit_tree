MIPS: MAAR: Fix address alignment

The alignment of MIPS MAAR region addresses isn't quite right.

- It rounds an already 64 KiB aligned start address up to the next
  64 KiB boundary, e.g. 0x80000000 is rounded up to 0x80010000.

- It assumes the end address is already on a 64 KiB boundary and doesn't
  round it down. Should that not be the case it will hit the second
  BUG_ON() in write_maar_pair().

Both cases are addressed by rounding up and down to 64 KiB boundaries in
the more traditional way of adding 0xffff (for rounding up) and masking
off the low 16 bits.
