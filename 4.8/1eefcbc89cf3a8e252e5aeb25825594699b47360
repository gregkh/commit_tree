MIPS: Fix BUILD_ROLLBACK_PROLOGUE for microMIPS

When the kernel is built for microMIPS, branches targets need to be
known to be microMIPS code in order to result in bit 0 of the PC being
set. The branch target in the BUILD_ROLLBACK_PROLOGUE macro was simply
the end of the macro, which may be pointing at padding rather than at
code. This results in recent enough GNU linkers complaining like so:

    mips-img-linux-gnu-ld: arch/mips/built-in.o: .text+0x3e3c: Unsupported branch between ISA modes.
    mips-img-linux-gnu-ld: final link failed: Bad value
    Makefile:936: recipe for target 'vmlinux' failed
    make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

Fix this by changing the branch target to be the start of the
appropriate handler, skipping over any padding.
