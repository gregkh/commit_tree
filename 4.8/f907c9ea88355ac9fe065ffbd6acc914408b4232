serial: sh-sci: Add support for GPIO-controlled modem lines

Enhance the Renesas SCI UART driver to add support for GPIO-controlled
modem lines (CTS, DSR, DCD, RNG, RTS, DTR), using the serial_mctrl_gpio
helpers.

GPIO-controlled modem lines can be used when dedicated modem lines are
not available. Invalid configurations specifying both GPIO RTS/CTS and
dedicated RTS/CTS are rejected.
