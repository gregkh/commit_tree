lkdtm: Mark lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing() notrace

lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing() is an empty function which is generated in
order to test the non-executability of rodata.

Currently if function tracing is enabled then an mcount callsite will be
generated for lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing(), and it will appear in the list
of available functions for function tracing (available_filter_functions).

Given it's purpose purely as a test function, it seems preferable for
lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing() to be marked notrace, so it doesn't appear as
traceable.

This also avoids triggering a linker bug on powerpc:

  https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20428

When the linker sees code that needs to generate a call stub, eg. a
branch to mcount(), it assumes the section is executable and
dereferences a NULL pointer leading to a linker segfault. Marking
lkdtm_rodata_do_nothing() notrace avoids triggering the bug because the
function contains no other function calls.
