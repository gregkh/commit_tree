drm/i915/ilk: Don't disable SSC source if it's in use

Thanks to Ville Syrjälä for pointing me towards the cause of this issue.

Unfortunately one of the sideaffects of having the refclk for a DPLL set
to SSC is that as long as it's set to SSC, the GPU will prevent us from
powering down any of the pipes or transcoders using it. A couple of
BIOSes enable SSC in both PCH_DREF_CONTROL and in the DPLL
configurations. This causes issues on the first modeset, since we don't
expect SSC to be left on and as a result, can't successfully power down
the pipes or the transcoders using it. Here's an example from this Dell
OptiPlex 990:

[drm:intel_modeset_init] SSC enabled by BIOS, overriding VBT which says disabled
[drm:intel_modeset_init] 2 display pipes available.

Later modesets succeed since they reset the DPLL's configuration anyway,
but this is enough to get stuck with a big fat warning in dmesg.

A better solution would be to add refcounts for the SSC source, but for
now leaving the source clock on should suffice.

Changes since v4:
 - Fix calculation of final for systems with LVDS panels (fixes BUG() on
   CI test suite)
Changes since v3:
 - Move temp variable into loop
 - Move checks for using_ssc_source to after we've figured out has_ck505
 - Add using_ssc_source to debug output
Changes since v2:
 - Fix debug output for when we disable the CPU source
Changes since v1:
 - Leave the SSC source clock on instead of just shutting it off on all
   of the DPLL configurations.
