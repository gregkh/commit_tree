mm, vmscan: only allocate and reclaim from zones with pages managed by the buddy allocator

Firmware Assisted Dump (FA_DUMP) on ppc64 reserves substantial amounts
of memory when booting a secondary kernel.  Srikar Dronamraju reported
that multiple nodes may have no memory managed by the buddy allocator
but still return true for populated_zone().

Commit 1d82de618ddd ("mm, vmscan: make kswapd reclaim in terms of
nodes") was reported to cause kswapd to spin at 100% CPU usage when
fadump was enabled.  The old code happened to deal with the situation of
a populated node with zero free pages by co-incidence but the current
code tries to reclaim populated zones without realising that is
impossible.

We cannot just convert populated_zone() as many existing users really
need to check for present_pages.  This patch introduces a managed_zone()
helper and uses it in the few cases where it is critical that the check
is made for managed pages -- zonelist construction and page reclaim.
