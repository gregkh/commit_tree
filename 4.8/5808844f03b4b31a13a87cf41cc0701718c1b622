MIPS: KVM: Fix 64-bit big endian dynamic translation

The MFC0 and MTC0 instructions in the guest which cause traps can be
replaced with 32-bit loads and stores to the commpage, however on big
endian 64-bit builds the offset needs to have 4 added so as to
load/store the least significant half of the long instead of the most
significant half.
