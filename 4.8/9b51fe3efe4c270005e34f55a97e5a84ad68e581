ALSA: hda - On-board speaker fixup on ACER Veriton

On Acer Veriton machines, codec with subsystem-id 0x1b0a01b8 the port at
0x15 is configured by default as an Internal Speaker (0x90170120).
However, no physical is speaker installed on-board. This patch adds a quirk
which disables the physical connection on this pin.
