[media] DocBook: add dmabuf as streaming I/O in VIDIOC_REQBUFS description

Commit 4b9c1cb641c46 ("[media] Documentation: media: description of DMABUF
importing in V4L2") documented the V4L2 dma-buf importing support but did
not update the VIDIOC_REQBUFS description, so only the Memory Mapping and
User Pointer I/O methods are mentioned.
