bnxt: Update drivers to support unified UDP encapsulation offload functions

This patch ends up doing several things.  First it updates the driver to
make use of the new unified UDP tunnel offload notifier functions.  In
addition I updated the code so that we can work around the bits that were
checking for if VXLAN was enabled since we are now using a notifier based
setup.
