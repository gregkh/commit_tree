dm: fix second blk_delay_queue() parameter to be in msec units not jiffies

Commit d548b34b062 ("dm: reduce the queue delay used in dm_request_fn
from 100ms to 10ms") always intended the value to be 10 msecs -- it
just expressed it in jiffies because earlier commit 7eaceaccab ("block:
remove per-queue plugging") did.
