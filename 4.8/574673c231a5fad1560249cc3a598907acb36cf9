printk: Remove unnecessary #ifdef CONFIG_PRINTK

In commit 874f9c7da9a4 ("printk: create pr_<level> functions"), new
pr_level defines were added to printk.c.

These new defines are guarded by an #ifdef CONFIG_PRINTK - however,
there is already a surrounding #ifdef CONFIG_PRINTK starting a lot
earlier in line 249 which means the newly introduced #ifdef is
unnecessary.

Let's remove it to avoid confusion.
