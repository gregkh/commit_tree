tools: Add copy of perf_event.h to tools/include/linux/

We shouldn't use headers from the kernel sources directly, instead we
should use the system's headers or in cases where that isn't possible,
like with perf_event.h, where the introduction of kernel features such
as perf_event_attr.{write_backwards,sample_max_stack} and
PERF_EVENT_IOC_PAUSE_OUTPUT take some time to become available in
/usr/include/linux/perf_event.h we need a copy.

Do it and check for source code drift, emitting a warning when changes
are detected.
