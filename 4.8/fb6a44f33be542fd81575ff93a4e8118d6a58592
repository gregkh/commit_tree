locking/rwsem: Protect all writes to owner by WRITE_ONCE()

Without using WRITE_ONCE(), the compiler can potentially break a
write into multiple smaller ones (store tearing). So a read from the
same data by another task concurrently may return a partial result.
This can result in a kernel crash if the data is a memory address
that is being dereferenced.

This patch changes all write to rwsem->owner to use WRITE_ONCE()
to make sure that store tearing will not happen. READ_ONCE() may
not be needed for rwsem->owner as long as the value is only used for
comparison and not dereferencing.
