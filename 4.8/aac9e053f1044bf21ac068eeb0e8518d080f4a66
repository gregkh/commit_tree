ixgbe: cleanup crosstalk fix

This patch address a few issues with the initial crosstalk fix.  Most
important of which is the SDP that indicates the presents of a SFP+
module changes between HW types.  With this change that is taken in
to consideration

It also moves the check closer to the base code that checks link.  This
makes it so we only need to do the check in one spot.
