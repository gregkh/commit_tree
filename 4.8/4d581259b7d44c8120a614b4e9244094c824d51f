x86/reboot: Add Dell Optiplex 7450 AIO reboot quirk

Dell Optiplex 7450 AIO works with BOOT_ACPI; however, the quirk for
"OptiPlex 745" changes its boot method to BOOT_BIOS and causes 7450 AIO
hangs when rebooting; as a result, 7450 AIO is appended to overwrite
BOOT_BIOS by BOOT_ACPI in order not to break the original 745 series
