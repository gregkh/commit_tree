KVM: s390: pfmf: support conditional-sske facility

We already indicate that facility but don't implement it in our pfmf
interception handler. Let's add a new storage key handling function for
conditionally setting the guest storage key.

As we will reuse this function later on, let's directly implement returning
the old key via parameter and indicating if any change happened via rc.
