hwmon: (ina3221) Fix negative limits

The result of an integer divide by an unsigned is undefined.
This causes unexpected results when writing negative values
into the limit registers.

Maintain the shunt_resistors variables as signed integer to avoid
the problem. Also, for simplicity and ease of use, clamp shunt
resistor value on writes instead of rejecting bad values.
