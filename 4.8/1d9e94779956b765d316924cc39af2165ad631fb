ARM: i.MX: system.c: Tweak prefetch settings for performance

Update Prefetch Control Register settings to match that of Freescale's
Linux tree. As the commit e3addf1b773964eac7f797e8538c69481be4279c
states (author Nitin Garg):

"... set Prefetch offset to 15, since it improves memcpy performance by
35%. Don't enable Incr double Linefill enable since it adversely affects
memcpy performance by about 32MB/s and reads by 90MB/s. Tested with 4K
to 16MB sized src and dst aligned buffer..."

Those results are also corroborated by our own testing.
