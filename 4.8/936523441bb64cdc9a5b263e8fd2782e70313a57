batman-adv: Add missing refcnt for last_candidate

batadv_find_router dereferences last_bonding_candidate from
orig_node without making sure that it has a valid reference. This reference
has to be retrieved by increasing the reference counter while holding
neigh_list_lock. The lock is required to avoid that
batadv_last_bonding_replace removes the current last_bonding_candidate,
reduces the reference counter and maybe destroys the object in this
process.
