MIPS: KVM: Relative branch to common exit handler

Use a relative branch to get from the individual exception vectors to
the common guest exit handler, rather than loading the address of the
exit handler and jumping to it.

This is made easier due to the fact we are now generating the entry code
dynamically. This will also allow the exception code to be further
reduced in future patches.
