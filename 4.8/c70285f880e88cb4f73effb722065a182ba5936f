IB/uverbs: Extend create QP to get RWQ indirection table

User applications that want to spread incoming traffic between several WQs
should create a QP which contains an indirection table.

When such a QP is created other receive side parameters are not valid
and should not be given. Its send side is optional and assumed active
based on max_send_wr capability value.

Extend create QP to work accordingly.
