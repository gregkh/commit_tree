perf/core: Fix implicitly enable dynamic interrupt throttle

This patch fixes an issue which was introduced by commit:

  91a612eea9a3 ("perf/core: Fix dynamic interrupt throttle")

... which commit unconditionally sets the perf_sample_allowed_ns value
to !0. But that could trigger a bug in the following corner case:

The user can disable the dynamic interrupt throttle mechanism by setting
perf_cpu_time_max_percent to 0. Then they change perf_event_max_sample_rate.
For this case, the mechanism will be enabled implicitly, because
perf_sample_allowed_ns becomes !0 - which is not what we want.

This patch only updates perf_sample_allowed_ns when the dynamic
interrupt throttle mechanism is enabled.
