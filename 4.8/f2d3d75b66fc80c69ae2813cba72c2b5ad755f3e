drbd: sync_handshake: handle identical uuids with current (frozen) Primary

If in a two-primary scenario, we lost our peer, freeze IO,
and are still frozen (no UUID rotation) when the peer comes back
as Secondary after a hard crash, we will see identical UUIDs.

The "rule_nr = 40" chose to use the "CRASHED_PRIMARY" bit as
arbitration, but that would cause the still running (but frozen) Primary
to become SyncTarget (which it typically refuses), and the handshake is
declined.

Fix: check current roles.
If we have *one* current primary, the Primary wins.
(rule_nr = 41)

Since that is a protocol change, use the newly introduced DRBD_FF_WSAME
to determine if rule_nr = 41 can be applied.
