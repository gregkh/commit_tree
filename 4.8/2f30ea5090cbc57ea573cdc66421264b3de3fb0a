xfrm_user: propagate sec ctx allocation errors

When we fail to attach the security context in xfrm_state_construct()
we'll return 0 as error value which, in turn, will wrongly claim success
to userland when, in fact, we won't be adding / updating the XFRM state.

This is a regression introduced by commit fd21150a0fe1 ("[XFRM] netlink:
Inline attach_encap_tmpl(), attach_sec_ctx(), and attach_one_addr()").

Fix it by propagating the error returned by security_xfrm_state_alloc()
in this case.
