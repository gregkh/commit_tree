xprtrdma: Use scatterlist for DMA mapping and unmapping under FMR

The use of a scatterlist for handling DMA mapping and unmapping
was recently introduced in frwr_ops.c in commit 4143f34e01e9
("xprtrdma: Port to new memory registration API"). That commit did
not make a similar update to xprtrdma's FMR support because the
core ib_map_phys_fmr() and ib_unmap_fmr() APIs have not been changed
to take a scatterlist argument.

However, FMR still needs to do DMA mapping and unmapping. It appears
that RDS, for example, uses a scatterlist for this, then builds the
DMA addr array for the ib_map_phys_fmr call separately. I see that
SRP also utilizes a scatterlist for DMA mapping. xprtrdma can do
something similar.

This modernization is used immediately to properly defer DMA
unmapping during fmr_unmap_safe (a FIXME). It separates the DMA
unmapping coordinates from the rl_segments array. This array, being
part of an rpcrdma_req, is always re-used immediately when an RPC
exits. A scatterlist is allocated in memory independent of the
rl_segments array, so it can be preserved indefinitely (ie, until
the MR invalidation and DMA unmapping can actually be done by a
worker thread).

The FRWR and FMR DMA mapping code are slightly different from each
other now, and will diverge further when the "Check for holes" logic
can be removed from FRWR (support for SG_GAP MRs). So I chose not to
create helpers for the common-looking code.
