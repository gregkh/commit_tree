KVM: s390: vsie: fix riccbd

We store the address of riccbd at the wrong location, overwriting
gvrd. This means that our nested guest will not be able to use runtime
instrumentation. Also, a memory leak, if our KVM guest actually sets gvrd.

Not noticed until now, as KVM guests never make use of gvrd and runtime
instrumentation wasn't completely tested yet.
