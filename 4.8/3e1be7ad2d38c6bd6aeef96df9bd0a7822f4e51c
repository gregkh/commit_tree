bnx2: Reset device during driver initialization

When system enters into kdump kernel because of kernel panic, it won't
shutdown devices. On-flight DMA will continue transferring data until
device driver initializes. All devices are supposed to reset during
driver initialization. And this property is used to fix the kdump
failure in system with intel iommu. Other systems with hardware iommu
should be similar. Please check commit 091d42e ("iommu/vt-d: Copy
translation tables from old kernel") and those commits around.

But bnx2 driver doesn't reset device during driver initialization. The
device resetting is deferred to net device up stage. This will cause
hardware iommu handling failure on bnx2 device. And its resetting relies
on firmware. So in this patch move the firmware requesting code to earlier
bnx2_init_one(), then next call bnx2_reset_chip to reset device.
