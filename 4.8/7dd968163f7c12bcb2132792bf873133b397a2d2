bitmap: bitmap_equal memcmp optimization

The bitmap_equal function has optimized code for small bitmaps with less
than BITS_PER_LONG bits. For larger bitmaps the out-of-line function
__bitmap_equal is called.

For a constant number of bits divisible by BITS_PER_LONG the memcmp
function can be used. For s390 gcc knows how to optimize this function,
memcmp calls with up to 256 bytes / 2048 bits are translated into a
single instruction.
