KVM: arm64: ITS: avoid re-mapping LPIs

When a guest wants to map a device-ID/event-ID combination that is
already mapped, we may end up in a situation where an LPI is never
"put", thus never being freed.
Since the GICv3 spec says that mapping an already mapped LPI is
UNPREDICTABLE, lets just bail out early in this situation to avoid
any potential leaks.
