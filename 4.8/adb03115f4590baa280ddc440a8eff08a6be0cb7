net: get rid of an signed integer overflow in ip_idents_reserve()

Jiri Pirko reported an UBSAN warning happening in ip_idents_reserve()

[] UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in ./arch/x86/include/asm/atomic.h:156:11
[] signed integer overflow:
[] -2117905507 + -695755206 cannot be represented in type 'int'

Since we do not have uatomic_add_return() yet, use atomic_cmpxchg()
so that the arithmetics can be done using unsigned int.
