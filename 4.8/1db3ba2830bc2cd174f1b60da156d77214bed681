mfd: Add support for COMe-cSL6 and COMe-mAL10 to Kontron PLD driver

This is an unmodified resend of the patch already been sent on
February 17 as it seems to have fallen through the net.

This patch adds the DMI system ID of the Kontron COMe-cSL6 and
COME-mAL10 boards to the Kontron PLD driver. The list of supported
products in the module description is also updated.
