arm64: fix "dc cvau" cache operation on errata-affected core

The ARM errata 819472, 826319, 827319 and 824069 for affected
Cortex-A53 cores demand to promote "dc cvau" instructions to
"dc civac" as well.
Attribute the usage of the instruction in __flush_cache_user_range
to also be covered by our alternative patching efforts.
For that we introduce an assembly macro which both deals with
alternatives while still tagging the instructions as USER.
