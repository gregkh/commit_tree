serial: sh-sci: Do not start transfers from sci_startup()

FIFO reset is done in sci_reset(), called from sci_set_termios(), while
sci_start_tx() and sci_start_rx() are called before, from sci_startup().
However, starting transfers before the UART's FIFOs have been reset may
cause reading of stale data.

Remove the calls to sci_start_tx() and sci_start_rx() from sci_startup()
to fix this.

Transfers are still started when needed:
  - sci_start_rx() is called from sci_set_termios() after FIFO reset, if
    the CREAD flag is set,
  - sci_start_tx() is called from uart_change_speed() immediately
    thereafter, if transmission is enabled.
