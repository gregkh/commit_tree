net: xgene: fix maybe-uninitialized variable

Building with -Wmaybe-uninitialized shows a potential use of
an uninitialized variable:

drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_hw.c: In function 'xgene_enet_phy_connect':
drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_hw.c:802:23: warning: 'phy_dev' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Although the compiler correctly identified this based on the function,
the current code is still safe as long dev->of_node is non-NULL
for the case of CONFIG_ACPI=n, which is currently the case.

The warning is now disabled by default, but still appears when
building with W=1, and other build test tools should be able to
detect it as well. Adding an #else clause here makes the code
more robust and makes it clear to the compiler that this cannot
happen.
