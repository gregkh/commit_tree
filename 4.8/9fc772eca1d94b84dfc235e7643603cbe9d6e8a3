ASoC: arizona: Tie SYSCLK to DRC signal activity widgets

The intent is for SYSCLK to be tied to all input and output widgets such
that it turns on whenever the chip is in use. It is not tied to the DRC
signal activity detect virtual outputs, whilst in practice this is
unlikely to cause an issue (as an input will likely also be powered up)
best to correct.
