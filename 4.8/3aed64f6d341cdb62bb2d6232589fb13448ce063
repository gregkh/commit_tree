pvclock: introduce seqcount-like API

The version field in struct pvclock_vcpu_time_info basically implements
a seqcount.  Wrap it with the usual read_begin and read_retry functions,
and use these APIs instead of peppering the code with smp_rmb()s.
While at it, change it to the more pedantically correct virt_rmb().

With this change, __pvclock_read_cycles can be simplified noticeably.
