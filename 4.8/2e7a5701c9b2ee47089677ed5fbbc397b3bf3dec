drm/doc: Appease sphinx

Mostly this is unexpected indents. But really it's just a
demonstration for my patch, all these issues have been found&fixed
using the correct source file and line number support I just added.
All line numbers have been perfectly accurate.

One issue looked a bit fishy in intel_lrc.c, where I don't quite grok
what sphinx is unhappy about. But since that file looks like it has
never seen a proper kernel-doc parser I figured better to fix in a
separate path.

v2: Use fancy new &drm_device->struct_mutex linking (Jani).
