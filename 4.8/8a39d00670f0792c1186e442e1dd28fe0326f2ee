KVM: kvm_io_bus: Add kvm_io_bus_get_dev() call

The kvm_io_bus framework is a nice place of holding information about
various MMIO regions for kernel emulated devices.
Add a call to retrieve the kvm_io_device structure which is associated
with a certain MMIO address. This avoids to duplicate kvm_io_bus'
knowledge of MMIO regions without having to fake MMIO calls if a user
needs the device a certain MMIO address belongs to.
This will be used by the ITS emulation to get the associated ITS device
when someone triggers an MSI via an ioctl from userspace.
