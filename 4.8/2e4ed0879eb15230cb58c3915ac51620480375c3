dmaengine: edma: Use early completion for intermediate paRAM set in slave_sg

The driver limits the physical number of paRAM slots to be used by channels.
If the transfer needs more slots (more SGs) then the transfer is broken up
to smaller chunks. When the chunk is finished the driver will rewrite the
physical slots and continues the transfer. This set up time can take some
time and we might miss DMA events. If the intermediate set completion is
using early completion (the interrupt will happen when the last slot is
issued to the TPTC and not when the transfer is finished by the TPTC) we
will have a bit more time to update the paRAM slots and less likely to have
missed events.
