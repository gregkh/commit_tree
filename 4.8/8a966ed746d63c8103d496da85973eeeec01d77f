mm: make swapin readahead to improve thp collapse rate

This patch makes swapin readahead to improve thp collapse rate.  When
khugepaged scanned pages, there can be a few of the pages in swap area.

With the patch THP can collapse 4kB pages into a THP when there are up
to max_ptes_swap swap ptes in a 2MB range.

The patch was tested with a test program that allocates 400B of memory,
writes to it, and then sleeps.  I force the system to swap out all.
Afterwards, the test program touches the area by writing, it skips a
page in each 20 pages of the area.

Without the patch, system did not swap in readahead.  THP rate was %65
of the program of the memory, it did not change over time.

With this patch, after 10 minutes of waiting khugepaged had collapsed
%99 of the program's memory.
