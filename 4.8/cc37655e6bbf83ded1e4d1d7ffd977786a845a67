pwm: pwm-ti*: Remove support for local clock gating

The PWMSS local clock gating registers have no real purpose on OMAP ARM
devices. These registers were left over registers from DSP IP where the
PRCM doesn't exist. There is a silicon bug where gating and ungating clocks
don't function properly. TRMs will be update to indicate that these
registers shouldn't be touched.

Therefore, all code that accesses the PWMSS_CLKCONFIG or PWMSS_CLKSTATUS
will be removed by this patch with zero loss of functionality by the ECAP
and EPWM drivers.
