macsec: use after free when deleting the underlying device

macsec_notify() loops over the list of macsec devices configured on the
underlying device when this device is being removed.  This list is part
of the rx_handler data.

However, macsec_dellink unregisters the rx_handler and frees the
rx_handler data when the last macsec device is removed from the
underlying device.

Add macsec_common_dellink() to delete macsec devices without
unregistering the rx_handler and freeing the associated data.
