Revert "mfd: intel_soc_pmic_core: Terminate panel control GPIO lookup table correctly"

This reverts commit 3543995a71b9150621bf30f4b45820d9cf65adb4.

I mixed up maintainers and thought Linus' ack was for the mfd tree.
But Lee Jones (the real maintainer) wants to merge this through the
mfd tree, so revert here.
