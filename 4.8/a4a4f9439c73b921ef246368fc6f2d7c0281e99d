bdev: get rid of ->bd_inodes

Since 2006 we have ->i_bdev pinning bdev in question, so there's no
way to get to bdev ->evict_inode() while there's an aliasing inode
anywhere.  In other words, the only place walking the list of aliases
is guaranteed to do it only when the list is empty...

Remove the detritus; it should've been done in "[PATCH] Fix a race
condition between ->i_mapping and iput()", but nobody had noticed it
back then.
