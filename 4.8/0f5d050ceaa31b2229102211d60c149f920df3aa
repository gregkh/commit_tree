s390/cio: allow to reset channel measurement block

Prior to commit 1bc6664bdfb949bc69a08113801e7d6acbf6bc3f a call to
enable_cmf for a device for which channel measurement was already
enabled resulted in a reset of the measurement data.

What looked like bugs at the time (a 2nd allocation was triggered
but failed, reset was called regardless of previous failures, and
errors have not been reported to userspace) was actually something
at least one userspace tool depended on. Restore that behavior in
a sane way.
