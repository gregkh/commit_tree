pwm: Add a driver for the STMPE PWM

This adds a driver for the PWM block found in chips of the STMPE 24xx
series of multi-purpose I2C expanders. (I think STMPE means ST
Microelectronics Multi-Purpose Expander.) This PWM was designed in
accordance with Nokia specifications and is kind of weird and usually
just switched between max and zero duty cycle. However it is indeed a
PWM so it needs to live in the PWM subsystem.

This PWM is mostly used for white LED backlight.
