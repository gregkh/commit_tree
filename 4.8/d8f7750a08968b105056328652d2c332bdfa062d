nvmet-rdma: Correctly handle RDMA device hot removal

When configuring a device attached listener, we may
see device removal events. In this case we return a
non-zero return code from the cm event handler which
implicitly destroys the cm_id. It is possible that in
the future the user will remove this listener and by
that trigger a second call to rdma_destroy_id on an
already destroyed cm_id -> BUG.

In addition, when a queue bound (active session) cm_id
generates a DEVICE_REMOVAL event we must guarantee all
resources are cleaned up by the time we return from the
event handler.

Introduce nvmet_rdma_device_removal which addresses
(or at least attempts to) both scenarios.
