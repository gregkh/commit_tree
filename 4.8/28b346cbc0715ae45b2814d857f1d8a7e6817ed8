tcp: fastopen: fix rcv_wup initialization for TFO server on SYN/data

Yuchung noticed that on the first TFO server data packet sent after
the (TFO) handshake, the server echoed the TCP timestamp value in the
SYN/data instead of the timestamp value in the final ACK of the
handshake. This problem did not happen on regular opens.

The tcp_replace_ts_recent() logic that decides whether to remember an
incoming TS value needs tp->rcv_wup to hold the latest receive
sequence number that we have ACKed (latest tp->rcv_nxt we have
ACKed). This commit fixes this issue by ensuring that a TFO server
properly updates tp->rcv_wup to match tp->rcv_nxt at the time it sends
a SYN/ACK for the SYN/data.
