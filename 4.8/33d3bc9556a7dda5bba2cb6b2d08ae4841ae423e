KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Read initial LPI pending table

The LPI pending status for a GICv3 redistributor is held in a table
in (guest) memory. To achieve reasonable performance, we cache the
pending bit in our struct vgic_irq. The initial pending state must be
read from guest memory upon enabling LPIs for this redistributor.
As we can't access the guest memory while we hold the lpi_list spinlock,
we create a snapshot of the LPI list and iterate over that.
