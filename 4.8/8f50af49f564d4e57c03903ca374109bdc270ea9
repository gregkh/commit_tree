s390/console: Make preferred console handling more consistent

Use the same code structure when determining preferred consoles for
Linux running as KVM guest as with Linux running in LPAR and z/VM
guest:

 - Extend the console_mode variable to cover vt220 and hvc consoles
 - Determine sensible console defaults in conmode_default()
 - Remove KVM-special handling in set_preferred_console()

Ensure that the sclp line mode console is also registered when the
vt220 console was selected to not change existing behavior that
someone might be relying on.

As an externally visible change, KVM guest users can now select
the 3270 or 3215 console devices using the conmode= kernel parameter,
provided that support for the corresponding driver was compiled into
the kernel.
