intel_pstate: Declare pid_params/pstate_funcs/hwp_active __read_mostly

pid_params is written once by copy_pid_params() during initialization,
and thereafter is mostly read by hot path intel_pstate_update_util().
The read of pid_params gets more after commit a4675fbc4a7a ("cpufreq:
intel_pstate: Replace timers with utilization update callbacks")

pstate_funcs is written once by copy_cpu_funcs() during initialization,
and thereafter is mostly read by hot path intel_pstate_update_util()

hwp_active is written to once during initialization and thereafter is
mostly read by hot path intel_pstate_update_util().

The fact that they are mostly read and not written to makes them
candidates for __read_mostly declarations.
