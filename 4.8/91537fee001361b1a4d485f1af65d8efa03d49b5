mm: add NR_ZSMALLOC to vmstat

zram is very popular for some of the embedded world (e.g., TV, mobile
phones).  On those system, zsmalloc's consumed memory size is never
trivial (one of example from real product system, total memory: 800M,
zsmalloc consumed: 150M), so we have used this out of tree patch to
monitor system memory behavior via /proc/vmstat.

With zsmalloc in vmstat, it helps in tracking down system behavior due
to memory usage.
