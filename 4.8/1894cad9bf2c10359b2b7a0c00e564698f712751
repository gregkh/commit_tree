watchdog: skip min and max timeout validity check when max_hw_heartbeat_ms is defined

When max_hw_heartbeat_ms has a none zero value, max_timeout is not used.
So it's value can be 0. In such case if a driver uses min_timeout
functionality, then check will always fail.

This patch fixes above issue.
