drm/mediatek: enable hdmi output control bit

MT8173 HDMI hardware has a output control bit to enable/disable HDMI
output. Because of security reason, so this bit can ONLY be controlled
in ARM supervisor mode. Now the only way to enter ARM supervisor is the
ARM trusted firmware. So atf provides a API for HDMI driver to call to
setup this HDMI control bit to enable HDMI output in supervisor mode.
