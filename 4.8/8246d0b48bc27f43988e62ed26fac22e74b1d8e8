qed: PF enforce MAC limitation of VFs

The only limitation relating to MACs the PF enforce today on its VFs
is in case it has a forced-unicast MAC address for them, in which case
they can't configure other unicast addresses.
Specifically, the PF isn't enforcing the number of MAC addresse a VF can
configure regardless of the nubmer of such filters agreed upon by PF and
VF during the acquisition process.

PF's shadow-config is now extended to also contain information about its
VFs' unicast addresses configuration, allowing such enforcement.
