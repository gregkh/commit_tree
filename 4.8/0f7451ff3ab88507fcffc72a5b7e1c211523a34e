s390/ipl: use load normal for LPAR re-ipl

Avoid clearing memory for CCW-type re-ipl within a logical
partition. This can save a significant amount of time if a logical
partition contains a lot of memory.

On the other hand we still clear memory if running within a second
level hypervisor, since the hypervisor can simply free all memory that
was used for the guest.
