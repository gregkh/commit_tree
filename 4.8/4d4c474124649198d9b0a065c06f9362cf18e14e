perf/x86/intel/bts: Fix BTS PMI detection

Since BTS doesn't have a dedicated PMI status bit, the driver needs to
take extra care to check for the condition that triggers it to avoid
spurious NMI warnings.

Regardless of the local BTS context state, the only way of knowing that
the NMI is ours is to compare the write pointer against the interrupt
threshold.
