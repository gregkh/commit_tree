net: hisilicon: add support of acpi for hns-mdio

hns-mdio needs to register itself to mii-bus. The info of the device can
be read by both DT and ACPI.
HNS tries to call Linux PHY driver to help access PHY-devices, the HNS
hardware topology is as below. The MDIO controller may control several
PHY-devices, and each PHY-device connects to a MAC device. The MDIO will
be registered to mdiobus, then PHY-devices will register when each mac
find PHY device.

And the driver can handle reset sequence by _RST method in DSDT in ACPI
case.
