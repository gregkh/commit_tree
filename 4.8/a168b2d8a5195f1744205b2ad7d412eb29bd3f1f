drm/i915: Mark all default contexts as uninitialised after context loss

When the GPU is reset or state lost through suspend, every default
legacy context needs to reload their state - both the golden render
state and the L3 mapping. Only context images explicitly saved to memory
(i.e. all execlists and non-default legacy contexts) will retain their
state across the reset.

v2: Rebase
