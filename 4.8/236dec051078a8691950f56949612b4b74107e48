kconfig: tinyconfig: provide whole choice blocks to avoid warnings

Using "make tinyconfig" produces a couple of annoying warnings that show
up for build test machines all the time:

    .config:966:warning: override: NOHIGHMEM changes choice state
    .config:965:warning: override: SLOB changes choice state
    .config:963:warning: override: KERNEL_XZ changes choice state
    .config:962:warning: override: CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE changes choice state
    .config:933:warning: override: SLOB changes choice state
    .config:930:warning: override: CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE changes choice state
    .config:870:warning: override: SLOB changes choice state
    .config:868:warning: override: KERNEL_XZ changes choice state
    .config:867:warning: override: CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE changes choice state

I've made a previous attempt at fixing them and we discussed a number of
alternatives.

I tried changing the Makefile to use "merge_config.sh -n
$(fragment-list)" but couldn't get that to work properly.

This is yet another approach, based on the observation that we do want
to see a warning for conflicting 'choice' options, and that we can
simply make them non-conflicting by listing all other options as
disabled.  This is a trivial patch that we can apply independent of
plans for other changes.
