userns: Remove the now unnecessary FS_USERNS_DEV_MOUNT flag

Now that SB_I_NODEV controls the nodev behavior devpts can just clear
this flag during mount.  Simplifying the code and making it easier
to audit how the code works.  While still preserving the invariant
that s_iflags is only modified during mount.
