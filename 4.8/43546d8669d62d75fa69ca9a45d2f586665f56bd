kexec: allow architectures to override boot mapping

kexec physical addresses are the boot-time view of the system.  For
certain ARM systems (such as Keystone 2), the boot view of the system
does not match the kernel's view of the system: the boot view uses a
special alias in the lower 4GB of the physical address space.

To cater for these kinds of setups, we need to translate between the
boot view physical addresses and the normal kernel view physical
addresses.  This patch extracts the current transation points into
linux/kexec.h, and allows an architecture to override the functions.

Due to the translations required, we unfortunately end up with six
translation functions, which are reduced down to four that the
architecture can override.
