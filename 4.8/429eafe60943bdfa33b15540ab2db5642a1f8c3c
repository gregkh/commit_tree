xen: xen-pciback: Remove create_workqueue

System workqueues have been able to handle high level of concurrency
for a long time now and there's no reason to use dedicated workqueues
just to gain concurrency.  Replace dedicated xen_pcibk_wq with the
use of system_wq.

Unlike a dedicated per-cpu workqueue created with create_workqueue(),
system_wq allows multiple work items to overlap executions even on
the same CPU; however, a per-cpu workqueue doesn't have any CPU
locality or global ordering guarantees unless the target CPU is
explicitly specified and thus the increase of local concurrency shouldn't
make any difference.

Since the work items could be pending, flush_work() has been used in
xen_pcibk_disconnect(). xen_pcibk_xenbus_remove() calls free_pdev()
which in turn calls xen_pcibk_disconnect() for every pdev to ensure that
there is no pending task while disconnecting the driver.
