MIPS: KVM: Fix pre-r6 ll/sc instructions on r6

The atomic KVM register access macros in kvm_host.h (for the guest Cause
register with KVM in trap & emulate mode) use ll/sc instructions,
however they still .set mips3, which causes pre-MIPSr6 instruction
encodings to be emitted, even for a MIPSr6 build.

Fix it to use MIPS_ISA_ARCH_LEVEL as other parts of arch/mips already
do.
