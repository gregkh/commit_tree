tty: serial: samsung: add byte-order aware bit functions

This driver makes use of the __set_bit() and __clear_bit() functions.
When running under big-endian, these functions don't convert the bit
indexes when working with peripheral registers, leading to the
incorrect bits being set and cleared when running big-endian.

Add two new driver functions for setting and clearing bits that are
byte-order aware.
