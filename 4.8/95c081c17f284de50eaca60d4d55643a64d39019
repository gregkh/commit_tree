drm: Move master pointer from drm_minor to drm_device

There can only be one current master, and it's for the overall device.
Render/control minors don't support master-based auth at all.

This simplifies the master logic a lot, at least in my eyes: All these
additional pointer chases are just confusing.

While doing the conversion I spotted some locking fail:
- drm_lock/drm_auth check dev->master without holding the
  master_mutex. This is fallout from

      drm: Protect the master management with a drm_device::master_mutex v3

  but I honestly don't care one bit about those old legacy drivers
  using this.

- debugfs name info should just grab master_mutex.

- And the fbdev helper looked at it to figure out whether someone is
  using KMS. We just need a consistent value, so READ_ONCE. Aside: We
  should probably check if anyone has opened a control node too, but I
  guess current userspace doesn't really do that yet.

v2: Balance locking, reported by Julia.

v3: Rebase on top of Chris' oops fixes.
