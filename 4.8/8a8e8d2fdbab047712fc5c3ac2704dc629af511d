ubi: Only read necessary size when reading the VID header

When reading the vid hdr from the device UBI always reads a whole
page. Instead, read only the data we actually need and speed up
attachment of UBI devices by potentially making use of reading
subpages if the NAND driver supports it.

Since the VID header may be at offset vid_hdr_shift in the page and
we can only read from the beginning of a page we have to add that
offset to the read size.
