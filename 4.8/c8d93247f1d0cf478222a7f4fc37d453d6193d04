bcache: use op_is_write instead of checking for REQ_WRITE

We currently set REQ_WRITE/WRITE for all non READ IOs
like discard, flush, writesame, etc. In the next patches where we
no longer set up the op as a bitmap, we will not be able to
detect a operation direction like writesame by testing if REQ_WRITE is
set.

This has bcache use the op_is_write helper which will do the right
thing.
