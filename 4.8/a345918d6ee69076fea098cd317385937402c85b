vga_switcheroo: Support deferred probing of audio clients

Daniel Vetter pointed out that vga_switcheroo_client_probe_defer() could
be needed by audio clients as well. To avoid mistakes when someone adds
conditions for these in the future, constrain the single existing
condition to VGA clients by checking for PCI_BASE_CLASS_DISPLAY. This
encompasses both PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_VGA as well as PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_3D,
which is used by some Nvidia Optimus GPUs.

Any future checks for audio clients should then be constrained to
PCI_BASE_CLASS_MULTIMEDIA.

v6: Spun out from commit introducing vga_switcheroo_client_probe_defer()
    to keep it a pure refactoring change. (Emil Velikov, Jani Nikula)
