net/sched: cls_flower: Introduce support in SKIP SW flag

In order to make a filter processed only by hardware, skip_sw flag
should be supplied. This is an addition to the already existing skip_hw
flag (filter will be processed by software only). If no flag is
specified, filter will be processed by both software and hardware.

If only hardware offloaded filters exist, fl_classify() will return
without doing anything.

A following userspace patch will be sent once kernel patch is accepted.

Example:

tc filter add dev enp0s9 protocol ip prio 20 parent ffff: \
	flower \
		ip_proto 6 \
		indev enp0s9 \
		skip_sw \
	action skbedit mark 0x1234
