btrfs: fix one bug that process may endlessly wait for ticket in wait_reserve_ticket()

If can_overcommit() in btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size() returns true,
btrfs_async_reclaim_metadata_space() will not reclaim metadata space, just
return directly and also forget to wake up process which are waiting for
their tickets, so these processes will wait endlessly.

Fstests case generic/172 with mount option "-o compress=lzo" have revealed
this bug in my test machine. Here if we have tickets to handle, we must
handle them first.
