drm/i915/overlay: Replace i915_gem_obj_ggtt_offset() with the known flip_addr

When setting up the overlay page, we pin it into the GGTT (when using
virtual addresses) and store the offset as overlay->flip_addr. Rather
than doing a lookup of the GGTT address everytime, we can use the known
address instead.
