i40e: Clean up MSIX IRQs before suspend

The i40e_suspend() function calls another function that preps the device
for the power save and resume by freeing all the Tx/Rx resources and
interrupts but that function does not free the "other" causes interrupt
vector and IRQ. It also fails to call synchronize_irq() before freeing
the IRQ vectors.  This sometimes may result in some AER errors on those
systems with that PCIe error reporting feature enabled.

Call synchronize_irq() before freeing IRQ vectors and explicitly free
the other causes interrupt resources and shut down that MSIX interrupt.
