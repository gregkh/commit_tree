libata-scsi: set correct VERSION field for ZAC devices

Commit 856c46639309 ("libata: support device-managed ZAC devices")
had the line that "bumps" the VERSION field in standard INQUIRY data
removed. Add it back and claim SPC-5 version compatibility, which
matches with the current version descriptor "SPC-5 (no version claimed)"
that is used for ZAC devices.
