[media] v4l: vsp1: Group DRM RPF parameters in a structure

The vsp1_du_atomic_update_ext() function takes 7 RPF configuration
parameters, and more will likely be added later. This makes the code
difficult to read and error-prone as multiple parameters have the same
type.

Make the API safer and easier to extend in the future by grouping all
parameters in a structure. Use macro magic to ease the transition to the
new function by allowing the old and new functions to be called using
the same name. The macros and static inline wrapper will be removed as
soon as the caller is updated.
