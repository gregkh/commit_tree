arm64: kprobes: Fix overflow when saving stack

The MIN_STACK_SIZE macro tries evaluate how much stack space needs
to be saved in the jprobes_stack array, sized at 128 bytes.

When using the IRQ stack, said macro can happily return up to
IRQ_STACK_SIZE, which is 16kB. Mayhem follows.

This patch fixes things by getting rid of the crazy macro and
limiting the copy to be at most the size of the jprobes_stack
array, no matter which stack we're on.
