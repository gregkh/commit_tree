[media] af9035: I2C combined write + read transaction fix

This patch will modify the af9035 driver to use the register address
fields of the I2C read command for the combined write/read transaction
case.  Without this change, the firmware issues just a I2C read
transaction without the preceding write transaction to select the
register.
