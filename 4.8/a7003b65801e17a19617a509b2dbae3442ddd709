i2c: core: Cleanup I2C ACPI namespace

I2C ACPI enumeration was originally implemented in another module under
drivers/acpi/ but was later moved into i2c-core with added support for
I2C ACPI operation region.

Rename these acpi_i2c_ prefixed functions, structures and defines in
i2c-core to i2c_acpi_ in order to have more consistent name space.
