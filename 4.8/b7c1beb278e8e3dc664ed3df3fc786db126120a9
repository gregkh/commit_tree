bus: arm-ccn: Do not attempt to configure XPs for cycle counter

Fuzzing the CCN perf driver revealed a small but definitely dangerous
mistake in the event setup code. When a cycle counter is requested, the
driver should not reconfigure the events bus at all, otherwise it will
corrupt (in most but the simplest cases) its configuration and may end
up accessing XP array out of its bounds and corrupting control
registers.
