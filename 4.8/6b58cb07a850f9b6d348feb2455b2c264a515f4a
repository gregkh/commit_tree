usb: dwc2: gadget: Fix transfer stop programming for out endpoint

According DWC-OTG databook, "GOUTNakEff" is read only and can be
cleared only by "DCTL.CGOUTNak", but here we do not need to clear
it because DWC-OTG programming guide says that before disabling
any OUT endpoint, the application must enable Global OUT NAK mode,
so if this mode is enabled we can continue without this step.
