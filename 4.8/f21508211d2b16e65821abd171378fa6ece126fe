block: add REQ_OP definitions and helpers

The following patches separate the operation (WRITE, READ, DISCARD,
etc) from the rq_flag_bits flags. This patch adds definitions for
request/bio operations (REQ_OPs) and adds request/bio accessors to
get/set the op.

In this patch the REQ_OPs match the REQ rq_flag_bits ones
for compat reasons while all the code is converted to use the
op accessors in the set. In the last patches the op will become a
number and the accessors and helpers in this patch will be dropped
or updated.
