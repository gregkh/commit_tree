HID: i2c_hid: enable i2c-hid devices to suspend/resume asynchronously

i2c-hid devices' suspend/resume are usually time-consuming process.
For example, the touch controller(i2c-ATML1000:00) on ASUS T100 tablet
takes about 160ms for suspending and 120ms for resuming. This patch
enables i2c-hid devices to suspend/resume asynchronously. This will
take advantage of multicore and speed up system suspend/resume process.
