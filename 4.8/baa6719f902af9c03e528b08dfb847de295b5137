libfc: Update rport reference counting

Originally libfc would just be initializing the refcount to '1', and
using the disc_mutex to synchronize if and when the final put should be
happening.  This has a race condition as the mutex might be delayed,
causing other threads to access an invalid structure.  This patch
updates the rport reference counting to increase the reference every
time 'rport_lookup' is called, and decreases the reference
correspondingly.  This removes the need to hold 'disc_mutex' when
removing the structure, and avoids the above race condition.
