net/faraday: Support NCSI mode

This makes ftgmac100 driver support NCSI mode. The NCSI is enabled
on the interface if property "use-nc-si" or "use-ncsi" is found from
the device node in device tree.

   * No PHY device is used when NCSI mode is enabled.
   * The NCSI device (struct ncsi_dev) is created when probing the
     device while it's enabled/started when the interface is brought
     up.
   * Hardware IP checksum dosn't work when NCSI mode is enabled. It
     is disabled on enabled NCSI.
