MIPS: KVM: Don't indirect KVM functions

Several KVM module functions are indirected so that they can be accessed
from tlb.c which is statically built into the kernel. This is no longer
necessary as the relevant bits of code have moved into mmu.c which is
part of the KVM module, so drop the indirections.

Note: is_error_pfn() is defined inline in kvm_host.h, so didn't actually
require the KVM module to be loaded for it to work anyway.
