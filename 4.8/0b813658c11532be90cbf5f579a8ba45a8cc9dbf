eeprom: at24: add support for at24mac series

Add a new read function to the at24 driver allowing to retrieve the
factory-programmed mac address embedded in chips from the at24mac
family.

These chips can be instantiated similarily to the at24cs family,
except that there's no way of having access to both the serial number
and the mac address at the same time - the user must instantiate
either an at24cs or at24mac device as both special memory areas are
accessible on the same slave address.
