ARM: 8583/1: mm: fix location of _etext

The _etext position is defined to be the end of the kernel text code,
and should not include any part of the data segments. This interferes
with things that might check memory ranges and expect executable code
up to _etext. Just to be conservative, leave the kernel resource as
it was, using __init_begin instead of _etext as the end mark.
