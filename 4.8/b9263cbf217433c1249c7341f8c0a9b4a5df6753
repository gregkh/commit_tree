be2net: use max-TXQs limit too while provisioning VF queue pairs

When the PF driver provisions resources for VFs, it currently only looks
at max RSS queues available to calculate the number of VF queue pairs.
This logic breaks when there are less number of TX-queues than RSS-queues.
This patch fixes this problem by using the max-TXQs available in the
PF-pool in the calculations. As a part of this change the
be_calculate_vf_qs() routine is renamed as be_calculate_vf_res() and the
code that calculates limits on other related resources is moved here to
contain all resource calculation code inside one routine.
