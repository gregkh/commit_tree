printk: when dumping regs, show the stack, not thread_info

We currently show:

  task: <current> ti: <current_thread_info()> task.ti: <task_thread_info(current)>"

"ti" and "task.ti" are redundant, and neither is actually what we want
to show, which the the base of the thread stack.  Change the display to
show the stack pointer explicitly.
