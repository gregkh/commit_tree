KVM: nVMX: keep preemption timer enabled during L2 execution

Because the vmcs12 preemption timer is emulated through a separate hrtimer,
we can keep on using the preemption timer in the vmcs02 to emulare L1's
TSC deadline timer.

However, the corresponding bit in the pin-based execution control field
must be kept consistent between vmcs01 and vmcs02.  On vmentry we copy
it into the vmcs02; on vmexit the preemption timer must be disabled in
the vmcs01 if a preemption timer vmexit happened while in guest mode.

The preemption timer value in the vmcs02 is set by vmx_vcpu_run, so it
need not be considered in prepare_vmcs02.
