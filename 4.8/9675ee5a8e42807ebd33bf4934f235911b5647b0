[media] lirc_dev: fix variable constant comparisons

When comparing a variable with a constant, the comparison should

written in the human DNA.

Swap the terms of comparisons whenever the constant comes first
and fix the following checkpatch warning:

  WARNING: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
