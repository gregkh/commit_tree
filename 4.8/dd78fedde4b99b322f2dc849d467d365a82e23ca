rmap: support file thp

Naive approach: on mapping/unmapping the page as compound we update
->_mapcount on each 4k page.  That's not efficient, but it's not obvious
how we can optimize this.  We can look into optimization later.

PG_double_map optimization doesn't work for file pages since lifecycle
of file pages is different comparing to anon pages: file page can be
mapped again at any time.
