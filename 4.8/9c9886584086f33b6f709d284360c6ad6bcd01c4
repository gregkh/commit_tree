MIPS: KVM: Drop now unused asm offsets

Now that locore.S is converted to uasm, remove a bunch of the assembly
offset definitions created by asm-offsets.c, including the CPUINFO_ ones
for reading the variable asid mask, and the non FPU/MSA related VCPU_
definitions. KVM's fpu.S and msa.S still use the remaining definitions.
