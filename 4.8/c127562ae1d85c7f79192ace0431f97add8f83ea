powerpc/powernv: Increase PE# capacity

Each PHB maintains an array helping to translate 2-bytes Request
ID (RID) to PE# with the assumption that PE# takes one byte, meaning
that we can't have more than 256 PEs. However, pci_dn->pe_number
already had 4-bytes for the PE#.

This extends the PE# capacity for every PHB. After that, the PE number
is represented by 4-bytes value. Then we can reuse IODA_INVALID_PE to
check the PE# in phb->pe_rmap[] is valid or not.
