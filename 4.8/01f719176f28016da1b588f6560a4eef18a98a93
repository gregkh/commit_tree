s390/mm: don't fault everything in read-write in gmap_pte_op_fixup()

Let's not fault in everything in read-write but limit it to read-only
where possible.

When restricting access rights, we already have the required protection
level in our hands. When reading from guest 2 storage (gmap_read_table),
it is obviously PROT_READ. When shadowing a pte, the required protection
level is given via the guest 2 provided pte.

Based on an initial patch by Martin Schwidefsky.
