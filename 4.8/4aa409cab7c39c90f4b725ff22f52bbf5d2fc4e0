zsmalloc: separate free_zspage from putback_zspage

Currently, putback_zspage does free zspage under class->lock if fullness
become ZS_EMPTY but it makes trouble to implement locking scheme for new
zspage migration.  So, this patch is to separate free_zspage from
putback_zspage and free zspage out of class->lock which is preparation
for zspage migration.
