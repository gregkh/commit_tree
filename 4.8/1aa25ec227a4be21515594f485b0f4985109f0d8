sctp: fix the issue sctp requeue auth chunk incorrectly

sctp needs to queue auth chunk back when we know that we are going
to generate another segment. But commit f1533cce60d1 ("sctp: fix
panic when sending auth chunks") requeues the last chunk processed
which is probably not the auth chunk.

It causes panic when calculating the MAC in sctp_auth_calculate_hmac(),
as the incorrect offset of the auth chunk in skb->data.

This fix is to requeue it by using packet->auth.
