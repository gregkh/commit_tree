ARM: dts: logicpd-somlv: Fix NAND device nodes

This fix was applied to a bunch of omap3 devices including LogicPD
Torpedo, but this got missed since it was new around the same times
the patches were applied.  This makes the GPMC parameters match the
Torpedo since they have the same processor PoP memory.
