mm: remove pointless struct in struct page definition

This patchset implements per kmemcg accounting of page tables
(x86-only), pipe buffers, and unix socket buffers.

Patches 1-3 are just cleanups that are not supposed to introduce any
functional changes.  Patches 4 and 5 move charge/uncharge to generic
page allocator paths for the sake of accounting pipe and unix socket
buffers.  Patches 5-7 make x86 page tables, pipe buffers, and unix
socket buffers accountable.

This patch (of 8):

... to reduce indentation level thus leaving more space for comments.
