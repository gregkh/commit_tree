binfmt_flat: use proper user space accessors with relocs processing code

Relocs are fixed up in place in user space memory.  The appropriate
accessors are required for this code to work with an active MMU.

The architecture specific handlers flat_get_addr_from_rp() and
flat_put_addr_at_rp() for ARM and M68K are adjusted with separate
patches. SuperH and Xtensa are left out as they doesn't implement
__get_user_unaligned() and __put_user_unaligned() yet. The other
architectures that use BFLT don't have any MMU.
