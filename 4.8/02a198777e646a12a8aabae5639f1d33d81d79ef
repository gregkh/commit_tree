net: fixup for tracepoint napi:napi_poll

The recent change to tracepoint napi:napi_poll changed the order of
the parameters that perf scripts sees, the printk was correct.  The
problem was that the new parameters (work and budget) were pushed
in front of dev_name.

The new parameters obviously need to be appended to keep backward
compatible.
