eeprom: at24: split at24_eeprom_write() into specialized functions

Split at24_eeprom_write() into three smaller functions - one for the
i2c operations and two for the smbus extensions (separate routines for
block and byte transfers). Assign them in at24_probe() depending on
the bus capabilities.

Also: in order to avoid duplications move code adjusting the count
argument into a separate function and use it for i2c and smbus block
writes (no need for a roll-over for byte writes as we're always
writing one byte).
