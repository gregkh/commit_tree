audit: add fields to exclude filter by reusing user filter

RFE: add additional fields for use in audit filter exclude rules
https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-kernel/issues/5

Re-factor and combine audit_filter_type() with audit_filter_user() to
use audit_filter_user_rules() to enable the exclude filter to
additionally filter on PID, UID, GID, AUID, LOGINUID_SET, SUBJ_*.

The process of combining the similar audit_filter_user() and
audit_filter_type() functions, required inverting the meaning and
including the ALWAYS action of the latter.

Include audit_filter_user_rules() into audit_filter(), removing
unneeded logic in the process.

Keep the check to quit early if the list is empty.
