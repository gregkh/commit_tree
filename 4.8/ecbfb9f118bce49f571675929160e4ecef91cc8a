dm raid: add raid level takeover support

Add raid level takeover support allowing arbitrary takeovers between
raid levels supported by md personalities (i.e. raid0, raid1/10 and
raid4/5/6):

 - add rs_config_{backup|restore} function to allow for temporary
   storing ctr requested layout changes and restore them for takeover
   conersion decision after the superblocks got loaded and analyzed

 - add members to store layout to 'struct raid_set' (not mandatory
   for takeover but needed for reshape in later patch)

 - add rebuild_disks bitfield to 'struct raid_set' and set bits in ctr
   to use in setting up takeover (base to address a 'rebuild' related
   raid_status() table line bug and needed as well for reshape in future
   patch)

 - add runtime flags and respective manipulation functions to be able to
   control e.g. wrting of superlocks to the preresume function on
   takeover and (later) reshape

 - add functions to detect takeover, check it's valid (mandatory here to
   avoid failing on md_run()), setup for it and use in the ctr; those
   will be likely moved out once reshaping gets added to simplify the
   ctr

 - start raid set readonly in ctr and switch to readwrite, optionally
   updating superblocks, in preresume in order to allow suspend to
   quiesce any active table before (which involves superblock updates);
   this ensures the proper sequence of writing the current and any new
   takeover(/reshape) metadata
