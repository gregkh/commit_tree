dma-buf: propagate errors from dma_buf_describe() on debugfs read

The callback function dma_buf_describe() returns an int not void so the
function pointer cast in dma_buf_show() is wrong. dma_buf_describe() can
also fail when acquiring the mutex gets interrupted so always returning
0 in dma_buf_show() is wrong, too.

Fix both issues by avoiding the indirection via dma_buf_show() and call
dma_buf_describe() directly. Rename it to dma_buf_debug_show() to get it
in line with the other functions.

This type mismatch was caught by the PaX RAP plugin.
