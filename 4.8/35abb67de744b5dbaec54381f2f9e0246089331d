tracing: expose current->comm to [ku]probe events

ftrace is very quick to give up on saving the task command line (see
`trace_save_cmdline()`). The workaround for events which really care
about the command line is to explicitly assign it as part of the entry.
However, this doesn't work for kprobe events, as there's no
straightforward way to get access to current->comm. Add a kprobe/uprobe
event variable $comm which provides exactly that.
