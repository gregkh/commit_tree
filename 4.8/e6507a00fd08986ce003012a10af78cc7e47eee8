Documentation: add watermark_scale_factor to the list of vm systcl file

Commit 795ae7a0de6b ("mm: scale kswapd watermarks in proportion to
memory") properly added the description of the new knob to
Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt, but forgot to add it to the list of files
in /proc/sys/vm. Let's fix that.
