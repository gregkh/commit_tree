netvsc: Use the new in-place consumption APIs in the rx path

Use the new APIs for eliminating a copy on the receive path. These new APIs also
help in minimizing the number of memory barriers we end up issuing (in the
ringbuffer code) since we can better control when we want to expose the ring
state to the host.

The patch is being resent to address earlier email issues.
