ASoC: rt5670: patch reg-0x8a

reg-8a assign the tracking source for each ASRC tracker. The default
value is 0x0000 which means all ASRC trackers will track LRCK1. But
in most case, we wish each ASRC tracker track the corresponding LRCK.
i.e. ASRC1 tracks LRCK1, ASRC2 tracks LRCK2 and so on. So, we rewrite
reg-8a as 0x0123.
