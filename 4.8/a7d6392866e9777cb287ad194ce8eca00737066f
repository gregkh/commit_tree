powerpc/crash: Rearrange loop condition to avoid out of bounds array access

The array crash_shutdown_handles[] has size CRASH_HANDLER_MAX, thus when
we loop over the elements of the list we check crash_shutdown_handles[i]
&& i < CRASH_HANDLER_MAX. However this means that when we increment i to
CRASH_HANDLER_MAX we will perform an out of bound array access checking
the first condition before exiting on the second condition.

To avoid the out of bounds access, simply reorder the loop conditions.
