ASoC: arizona: Add data structure for voice trigger notifier

64-bit builds would generate a warning when we passed the core number as
a pointer through the notifier data:

sound/soc/codecs/cs47l24.c:1091:13: warning: cast to pointer from
integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
             (void *)i);

Rather than just fix this up with more casting add a data structure that
holds information for the notifier chain. This will make it easier to
add additional information in the future as well.
