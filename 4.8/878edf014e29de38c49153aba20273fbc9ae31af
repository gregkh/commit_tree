MIPS: KVM: Restore host EBase from ebase variable

The host kernel's exception vector base address is currently saved in
the VCPU structure at creation time, and restored on a guest exit.
However it doesn't change and can already be easily accessed from the
'ebase' variable (arch/mips/kernel/traps.c), so drop the host_ebase
member of kvm_vcpu_arch, export the 'ebase' variable to modules and load
from there instead.

This does result in a single extra instruction (lui) on the guest exit
path, but simplifies the code a bit and removes the redundant storage of
the host exception base address.

Credit for the idea goes to Cavium's VZ KVM implementation.
