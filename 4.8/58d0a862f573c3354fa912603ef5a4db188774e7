seccomp: add tests for ptrace hole

One problem with seccomp was that ptrace could be used to change a
syscall after seccomp filtering had completed. This was a well documented
limitation, and it was recommended to block ptrace when defining a filter
to avoid this problem. This can be quite a limitation for containers or
other places where ptrace is desired even under seccomp filters.

This adds tests for both SECCOMP_RET_TRACE and PTRACE_SYSCALL manipulations.
