mm/hugetlb: avoid soft lockup in set_max_huge_pages()

In powerpc servers with large memory(32TB), we watched several soft
lockups for hugepage under stress tests.

The call traces are as follows:
1.
get_page_from_freelist+0x2d8/0xd50
__alloc_pages_nodemask+0x180/0xc20
alloc_fresh_huge_page+0xb0/0x190
set_max_huge_pages+0x164/0x3b0

2.
prep_new_huge_page+0x5c/0x100
alloc_fresh_huge_page+0xc8/0x190
set_max_huge_pages+0x164/0x3b0

This patch fixes such soft lockups.  It is safe to call cond_resched()
there because it is out of spin_lock/unlock section.
