staging/lustre/llite: IOC_MDC_GETFILEINFO returns the wrong ino

req_capsule_server_get() through  __req_capsule_get in ll_dir_ioctl()
returns a pointer to a PTLRPC request or reply buffer, which is assigned
to struct mdt_body.

If the command is IOC_MDS_GETFILEINFO then the inode "st.st_ino" should
be assigned from one extracted from mdt_body through cl_fid_build_ino().
