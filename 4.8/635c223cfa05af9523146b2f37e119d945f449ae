rps: flow_dissector: Fix uninitialized flow_keys used in __skb_get_hash possibly

The original codes depend on that the function parameters are evaluated from
left to right. But the parameter's evaluation order is not defined in C
standard actually.

When flow_keys_have_l4(&keys) is invoked before ___skb_get_hash(skb, &keys,
hashrnd) with some compilers or environment, the keys passed to
flow_keys_have_l4 is not initialized.

Fixes: 6db61d79c1e1 ("flow_dissector: Ignore flow dissector return value from ___skb_get_hash")
