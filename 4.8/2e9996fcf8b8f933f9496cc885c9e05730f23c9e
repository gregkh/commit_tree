s390/vmem: align segment and region tables to 16k

Usually segment and region tables are 16k aligned due to the way the
buddy allocator works.  This is not true for the vmem code which only
asks for a 4k alignment. In order to be consistent enforce a 16k
alignment here as well.

This alignment will be assumed and therefore is required by the
pageattr code.
