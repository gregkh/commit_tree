net: fec: align IP header in hardware

The FEC receive accelerator (RACC) supports shifting the data payload of
received packets by 16-bits, which aligns the payload (IP header) on a
4-byte boundary, which is, if not required, at least strongly suggested
by the Linux networking layer.

Without this patch, a huge number of alignment faults will be taken by the
IP stack, as seen in /proc/cpu/alignment:

	~/$ cat /proc/cpu/alignment
	User:		0
	System:		72645 (inet_gro_receive+0x104/0x27c)
	Skipped:	0
	Half:		0
	Word:		0
	DWord:		0
	Multi:		72645
	User faults:	3 (fixup+warn)

This patch was suggested by Andrew Lunn in this message to linux-netdev:
