ARM64: ACPI: Update documentation for latest specification version

The ACPI 6.1 specification was recently released at the end of January
2016, but the arm64 kernel documentation for the use of ACPI was written
for the 5.1 version of the spec.  There were significant additions to the
spec that had not yet been mentioned -- for example, the 6.0 mechanisms
added to make it easier to define processors and low power idle states,
as well as the 6.1 addition allowing regular interrupts (not just from
GPIO) be used to signal ACPI general purpose events.

This patch reflects going back through and examining the specs in detail
and updating content appropriately.  Whilst there, a few odds and ends of
typos were caught as well.  This brings the documentation up to date with
ACPI 6.1 for arm64.
