cpufreq: Handle sorted frequency tables more efficiently

cpufreq drivers aren't required to provide a sorted frequency table
today, and even the ones which provide a sorted table aren't handled
efficiently by cpufreq core.

This patch adds infrastructure to verify if the freq-table provided by
the drivers is sorted or not, and use efficient helpers if they are
sorted.
