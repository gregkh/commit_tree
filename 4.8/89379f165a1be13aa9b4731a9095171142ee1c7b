PCI/hotplug: pnv_php: export symbols and move struct types needed by cxl

The cxl driver will use infrastructure from pnv_php to handle device tree
updates when switching bi-modal CAPI cards into CAPI mode.

To enable this, export pnv_php_find_slot() and
pnv_php_set_slot_power_state(), and add corresponding declarations, as well
as the definition of struct pnv_php_slot, to asm/pnv-pci.h.
