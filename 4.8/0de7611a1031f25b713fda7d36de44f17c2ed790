timers/nohz: Capitalize 'CPU' consistently

While reviewing another patch I noticed that kernel/time/tick-sched.c
had a charmingly (confusingly, annoyingly) rich set of variants for
spelling 'CPU':

  cpu
  cpus
  CPU
  CPUs
  per CPU
  per-CPU
  per cpu

... sometimes these were mixed even within the same comment block!

Compress these variants down to a single consistent set of:

  CPU
  CPUs
  per-CPU
