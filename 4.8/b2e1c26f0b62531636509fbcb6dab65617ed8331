ftrace/recordmcount: Work around for addition of metag magic but not relocations

glibc recently did a sync up (94e73c95d9b5 "elf.h: Sync with the gabi
webpage") that added a #define for EM_METAG but did not add relocations

This triggers build errors:

scripts/recordmcount.c: In function 'do_file':
scripts/recordmcount.c:466:28: error: 'R_METAG_ADDR32' undeclared (first use in this function)
  case EM_METAG:  reltype = R_METAG_ADDR32;
                            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
scripts/recordmcount.c:466:28: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
scripts/recordmcount.c:468:20: error: 'R_METAG_NONE' undeclared (first use in this function)
     rel_type_nop = R_METAG_NONE;
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~

Work around this change with some more #ifdefery for the relocations.
