mmc: core: Allow hosts to specify non-support for MMC commands

Host drivers which needs to valdiate for non-supported MMC

To improve and simplify the behaviour, let's invent MMC_CAP2_NO_MMC
which these host drivers can set to tell the mmc core to skip sending MMC
commands during card initialization.
