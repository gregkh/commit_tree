gfs2: Get rid of gfs2_ilookup

Now that gfs2_lookup_by_inum only takes the inode glock for new inodes
(and not for cached inodes anymore), there no longer is a need to
optimize the cached-inode case in gfs2_get_dentry or delete_work_func,
and gfs2_ilookup can be removed.

In addition, gfs2_get_dentry wasn't checking the GFS2_DIF_SYSTEM flag in
i_diskflags in the gfs2_ilookup case (see gfs2_lookup_by_inum); this
inconsistency goes away as well.
