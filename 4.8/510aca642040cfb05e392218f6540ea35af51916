ARM: i.MX: Do not explicitly call l2x0_of_init()

There's no need to explicitly call l2x0_of_init() since it will be
called as a part of init_IRQ() (see arch/arm/kernel/irq.c for
details). This way we can simplify imx_init_l2cache() and ditch the call
to it on i.MX35 (which does not claim compatibility with
"arm,pl310-cache") alltogether.
