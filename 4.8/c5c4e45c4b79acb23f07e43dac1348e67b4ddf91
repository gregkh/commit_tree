sctp: fix GSO for IPv6

commit 90017accff61 ("sctp: Add GSO support") didn't register SCTP GSO
offloading for IPv6 and yet didn't put any restrictions on generating
GSO packets while in IPv6, which causes all IPv6 GSO'ed packets to be
silently dropped.

The fix is to properly register the offload this time.
