PCI: Add pcibios_setup_bridge()

Currently, PowerPC PowerNV platform utilizes ppc_md.pcibios_fixup(),
which is called for once after PCI probing and resource assignment
are completed, to allocate platform required resources for PCI devices:
PE#, IO and MMIO mapping, DMA address translation (TCE) table etc.
Obviously, it's not hotplug friendly.

This adds weak function pcibios_setup_bridge(), which is called by
pci_setup_bridge(). PowerPC PowerNV platform will reuse the function
to assign above platform required resources to newly plugged PCI devices
during PCI hotplug in subsequent patches.
