mfd: hi655x-pmic: Rename some interrupt macro names

Currently the hi655x-pmic driver has names for interrupt mask
values, but not for the interrupt numbers themselves.

So to allow for interrupt numbers to have sane names, rename
the mask values with the _MASK postfix and use the existing
names as the interrupt name
