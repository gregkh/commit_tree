tpm: use devm_add_action_or_reset

If devm_add_action() fails we are explicitly calling put_device() to
free the resources allocated. Lets use the helper
devm_add_action_or_reset() and return directly in case of error, as we
know that the cleanup function has been already called by the helper if
there was any error.
