cxl: use pcibios_free_controller_deferred() when removing vPHBs

When cxl removes a vPHB, it's possible that the pci_controller may be freed
before all references to the devices on the vPHB have been released. This
in turn causes an invalid memory access when the devices are eventually
released, as pcibios_release_device() attempts to call the phb's
release_device hook.

In cxl_pci_vphb_remove(), remove the existing call to
pcibios_free_controller(). Instead, use
pcibios_free_controller_deferred() to free the pci_controller after all
devices have been released. Export pci_set_host_bridge_release() so we can
do this.
