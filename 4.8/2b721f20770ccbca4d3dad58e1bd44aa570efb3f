drm: Protect fb_defio in drivers with CONFIG_KMS_FBDEV_EMULATION

For reasons that entirely elude me fb.h exposes all the structures,
even when it is not enabled. Except for special stuff like fb_defio.

Which means all the drivers which haven't yet switched over to the
defio support in the helpers and still roll their own, will fail
to compile when fbdev emulation is disabled. Protect just those
bits, as a gnarly reminder that conversion to the core defio helpers
would be good.
