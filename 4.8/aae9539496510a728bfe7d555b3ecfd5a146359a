iio: pressure: bmp280: add support for BMP085 EOC interrupt

The first version of this sensor, BMP085, supports sending an
End-of-Conversion (EOC) interrupt. Add code to support this using
a completion, in a similar vein as drivers/misc/bmp085.c does.

Make sure to check that we are given a rising edge, because the
EOC line goes from low-to-high when the conversion is ready.
