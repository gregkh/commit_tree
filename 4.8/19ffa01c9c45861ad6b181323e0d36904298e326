rxrpc: Use structs to hold connection params and protocol info

Define and use a structure to hold connection parameters.  This makes it
easier to pass multiple connection parameters around.

Define and use a structure to hold protocol information used to hash a
connection for lookup on incoming packet.  Most of these fields will be
disposed of eventually, including the duplicate local pointer.

Whilst we're at it rename "proto" to "family" when referring to a protocol
family.
