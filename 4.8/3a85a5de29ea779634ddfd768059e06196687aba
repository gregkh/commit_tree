nvme-loop: add a NVMe loopback host driver

This patch implements adds nvme-loop which allows to access local devices
exported as NVMe over Fabrics namespaces. This module can be useful for
easy evaluation, testing and also feature experimentation.

To createa nvme-loop device you need to configure the NVMe target to
export a loop port (see the nvmetcli documentaton for that) and then
connect to it using

	nvme connect-all -t loop

which requires the very latest nvme-cli version with Fabrics support.
