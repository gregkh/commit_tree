x86, asm: define CC_SET() and CC_OUT() macros

The CC_SET() and CC_OUT() macros can be used together to take
advantage of the new __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__ feature in gcc 6+ while
remaining backwards compatible.  CC_SET() generates a SET instruction
on older compilers; CC_OUT() makes sure the output is received in the
correct variable.
