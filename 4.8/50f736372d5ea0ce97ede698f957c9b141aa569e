perf auxtrace: Add option to feed branches to the thread stack

In preparation for using the thread stack to print an indent
representing the stack depth in perf script, add an option to tell
decoders to feed branches to the thread stack. Add support for that
option to Intel PT and Intel BTS.

The advantage of using the decoder to feed the thread stack is that it
happens before branch filtering and so can be used with different itrace
options (e.g. it still works when only showing calls, even though the
thread stack needs to see calls and returns). Also it does not conflict
with using the thread stack to get callchains.
