i2c: qup: skip qup_i2c_suspend if the device is already runtime suspended

If the i2c device is already runtime suspended, if qup_i2c_suspend is
executed during suspend-to-idle or suspend-to-ram it will result in the
following splat:

WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 1593 at drivers/clk/clk.c:476 clk_core_unprepare+0x80/0x90

This patch fixes the issue by executing qup_i2c_pm_suspend_runtime
conditionally in qup_i2c_suspend.
