block: add QUEUE_FLAG_DAX for devices to advertise their DAX support

Currently, presence of direct_access() in block_device_operations
indicates support of DAX on its block device.  Because
block_device_operations is instantiated with 'const', this DAX
capablity may not be enabled conditinally.

In preparation for supporting DAX to device-mapper devices, add
QUEUE_FLAG_DAX to request_queue flags to advertise their DAX
support.  This will allow to set the DAX capability based on how
mapped device is composed.
