tools: hv: Add a script to help bonding synthetic and VF NICs

This script helps to create bonding network devices based on synthetic NIC
(the virtual network adapter usually provided by Hyper-V) and the matching
VF NIC (SRIOV virtual function). So the synthetic NIC and VF NIC can
function as one network device, and fail over to the synthetic NIC if VF is
down.

Mayjor distros (RHEL, Ubuntu, SLES) supported by Hyper-V are supported by
this script.
