drm/i915: Always double check for a missed interrupt for new bottom halves

After assigning ourselves as the new bottom-half, we must perform a
cursory check to prevent a missed interrupt.  Either we miss the interrupt
whilst programming the hardware, or if there was a previous waiter (for
a later seqno) they may be woken instead of us (due to the inherent race
in the unlocked read of b->tasklet in the irq handler) and so we miss the
wake up.
