net: Use ns_capable_noaudit() when determining net sysctl permissions

The capability check should not be audited since it is only being used
to determine the inode permissions. A failed check does not indicate a
violation of security policy but, when an LSM is enabled, a denial audit
message was being generated.

The denial audit message caused confusion for some application authors
because root-running Go applications always triggered the denial. To
prevent this confusion, the capability check in net_ctl_permissions() is
switched to the noaudit variant.
