mm: workingset: fix crash in shadow node shrinker caused by replace_page_cache_page()

Antonio reports the following crash when using fuse under memory pressure:

which corresponds to the following sanity check in the shadow node
tracking:

  BUG_ON(node->count & RADIX_TREE_COUNT_MASK);

The workingset code tracks radix tree nodes that exclusively contain
shadow entries of evicted pages in them, and this (somewhat obscure)
line checks whether there are real pages left that would interfere with
reclaim of the radix tree node under memory pressure.

While discussing ways how fuse might sneak pages into the radix tree
past the workingset code, Miklos pointed to replace_page_cache_page(),
and indeed there is a problem there: it properly accounts for the old
page being removed - __delete_from_page_cache() does that - but then
does a raw raw radix_tree_insert(), not accounting for the replacement
page.  Eventually the page count bits in node->count underflow while
leaving the node incorrectly linked to the shadow node LRU.

To address this, make sure replace_page_cache_page() uses the tracked
page insertion code, page_cache_tree_insert().  This fixes the page
accounting and makes sure page-containing nodes are properly unlinked
from the shadow node LRU again.

Also, make the sanity checks a bit less obscure by using the helpers for
checking the number of pages and shadows in a radix tree node.
