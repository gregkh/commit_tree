bonding: Fix bonding crash

Following few steps will crash kernel -

  (a) Create bonding master
      > modprobe bonding miimon=50
  (b) Create macvlan bridge on eth2
      > ip link add link eth2 dev mvl0 address aa:0:0:0:0:01 \
	   type macvlan
  (c) Now try adding eth2 into the bond
      > echo +eth2 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
      <crash>

Bonding does lots of things before checking if the device enslaved is
busy or not.

In this case when the notifier call-chain sends notifications, the
bond_netdev_event() assumes that the rx_handler /rx_handler_data is
registered while the bond_enslave() hasn't progressed far enough to
register rx_handler for the new slave.

This patch adds a rx_handler check that can be performed right at the
beginning of the enslave code to avoid getting into this situation.
