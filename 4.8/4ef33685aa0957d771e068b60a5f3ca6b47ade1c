PCI: Spread interrupt vectors in pci_alloc_irq_vectors()

Set the affinity_mask in the PCI device before allocating vectors so that
the affinity can be propagated through the MSI descriptor structures to the
core IRQ code.  To facilitate this, new __pci_enable_msi_range() and
__pci_enable_msix_range() helpers are factored out of their not prefixed
variants which assigning the new IRQ affinity mask in the PCI device so
that the low-level interrupt code can perform the interrupt affinity
assignment and do node-local allocations.

A new PCI_IRQ_NOAFFINITY flag is added to pci_alloc_irq_vectors() so that
this function can also be used by drivers that don't wish to use the
automatic affinity assignment.
