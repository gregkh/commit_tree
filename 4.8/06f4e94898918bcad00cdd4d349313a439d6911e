cpuset: make sure new tasks conform to the current config of the cpuset

A new task inherits cpus_allowed and mems_allowed masks from its parent,
but if someone changes cpuset's config by writing to cpuset.cpus/cpuset.mems
before this new task is inserted into the cgroup's task list, the new task
won't be updated accordingly.
