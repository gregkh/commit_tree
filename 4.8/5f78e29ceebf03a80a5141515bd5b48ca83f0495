qeth: optimize IP handling in rx_mode callback

In layer3 mode of the qeth driver, multicast IP addresses
from struct net_device and other type of IP addresses
from other sources require mapping to the OSA-card.
This patch simplifies the IP address mapping logic, and changes imple-
mentation of ndo_set_rx_mode callback and ip notifier events.
Addresses are stored in private hashtables instead of lists now.
It allows hardware registration/removal for new/deleted multicast
addresses only.
