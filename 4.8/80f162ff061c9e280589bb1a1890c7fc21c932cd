block: mark 1st parameter of bvec_iter_advance as const

bvec_iter_advance() only writes the parameter of iterator,
so the base address of bvec can be marked as const safely.

Without the change, we can see compiling warning in the
following patch for implementing iterate_bvec(): lib/iov_iter.c
with bvec iterator.
