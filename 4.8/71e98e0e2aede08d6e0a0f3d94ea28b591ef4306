serial: sh-sci: Always set TIOCM_CTS in .get_mctrl() callback

Documentation/serial/driver clearly states:

    If the port does not support CTS, DCD or DSR, the driver should
    indicate that the signal is permanently active.

Hence always set TIOCM_CTS, as we currently don't look at the CTS
hardware line state at all.

FWIW, this fixes the transmit path when hardware-assisted flow control
is enabled, and userspace enables CRTSCTS.
The receive path is still broken, as RTS is never asserted.
