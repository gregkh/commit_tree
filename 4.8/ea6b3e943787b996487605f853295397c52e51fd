ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add DSP firmware manifest parsing

Module params like module_id and loadable flag can be changed
in the DSP Firmware. These are kept in the firmware manifest
and driver should read these values from this manifest.

So, add support to parse the DSP firmware manifest and
read these module params.
