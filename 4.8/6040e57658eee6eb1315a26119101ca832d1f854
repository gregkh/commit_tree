Make the hardened user-copy code depend on having a hardened allocator

The kernel test robot reported a usercopy failure in the new hardened
sanity checks, due to a page-crossing copy of the FPU state into the
task structure.

This happened because the kernel test robot was testing with SLOB, which
doesn't actually do the required book-keeping for slab allocations, and
as a result the hardening code didn't realize that the task struct
allocation was one single allocation - and the sanity checks fail.

Since SLOB doesn't even claim to support hardening (and you really
shouldn't use it), the straightforward solution is to just make the
usercopy hardening code depend on the allocator supporting it.
