s390/mm: prepare for EDAT1/EDAT2 support in gmap shadow

In preparation for EDAT1/EDAT2 support for gmap shadows, we have to store
the requested edat level in the gmap shadow.

The edat level used during shadow translation is a property of the gmap
shadow. Depending on that level, the gmap shadow will look differently for
the same guest tables. We have to store it internally in order to support
it later.
