xfs: introduce rmap extent operation stubs

Originally-From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Add the stubs into the extent allocation and freeing paths that the
rmap btree implementation will hook into. While doing this, add the
trace points that will be used to track rmap btree extent
manipulations.

[darrick.wong@oracle.com: Extend the stubs to take full owner info.]
