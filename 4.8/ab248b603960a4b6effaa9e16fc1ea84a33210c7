pwm: lpss: Prevent on_time_div overflow on lower frequencies

If duty_ns is large enough multiplying it by 255 overflows and results
wrong duty cycle value being programmed. For example with 10ms duty when
period is 20ms (50%) we get

  255 * 10000000 / 20000000 = -87

because 255 * 10000000 overlows int. Whereas correct value should be

  255 * 10000000 / 20000000 = 127

Fix this by using unsigned long long as type for on_time_div and changing
integer literals to use proper type annotation.
