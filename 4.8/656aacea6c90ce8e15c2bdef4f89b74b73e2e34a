IB/cxgb4: Make _free_qp static to silence build warning

We get 1 warning when build kernel with W=1:
drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb4/qp.c:686:6: warning: no previous prototype for '_free_qp' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, this function is only used in the file in which it is declared
and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks it 'static'.
