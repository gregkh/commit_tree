powerpc/32: Fix early access to cpu_spec relocation

Commit 9402c6846131 ("powerpc: Factor do_feature_fixup calls")
introduced a subtle bug on 32-bit. When reading the cpu spec from the
global, we not only need to do a pointer relocation on the global
address but also on the pointer we read from it.

This fixes crashes reported on MPC5200 based machines.
