integrity: add measured_pcrs field to integrity cache

To keep track of which measurements have been extended to which PCRs, this
patch defines a new integrity_iint_cache field named measured_pcrs. This
field is a bitmask of the PCRs measured. Each bit corresponds to a PCR
index. For example, bit 10 corresponds to PCR 10.
