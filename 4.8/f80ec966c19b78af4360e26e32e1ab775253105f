nvme: Limit command retries

Many controller implementations will return errors to commands that will
not succeed, but without the DNR bit set. The driver previously retried
these commands an unlimited number of times until the command timeout
has exceeded, which takes an unnecessarilly long period of time.

This patch limits the number of retries a command can have, defaulting
to 5, but is user tunable at load or runtime.

The struct request's 'retries' field is used to track the number of
retries attempted. This is in contrast with scsi's use of this field,
which indicates how many retries are allowed.
