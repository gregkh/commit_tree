soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: Improve SYSC interrupt config in legacy wrapper

Align SYSC interrupt configuration in the legacy wrapper with the DT
version:
  - Mask SYSC interrupt sources before enabling them (doesn't matter
    much as they're disabled at the GIC level anyway),
  - Make sure not to clear reserved SYSCIMR bits that were set before.
