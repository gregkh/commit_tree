ext4: short-cut orphan cleanup on error

If we encounter a filesystem error during orphan cleanup, we should stop.
Otherwise, we may end up in an infinite loop where the same inode is
processed again and again.

    EXT4-fs (loop0): warning: checktime reached, running e2fsck is recommended
    EXT4-fs error (device loop0): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:758: group 2, block bitmap and bg descriptor inconsistent: 6117 vs 0 free clusters
    Aborting journal on device loop0-8.
