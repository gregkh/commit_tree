net-next: mediatek: add IRQ locking

The code that enables and disables IRQs is missing proper locking. After
adding the IRQ grouping patch and routing the RX and TX IRQs to different
cores we experienced IRQ stalls. Fix this by adding proper locking.
We use a dedicated lock to reduce the latency if the IRQ code.
