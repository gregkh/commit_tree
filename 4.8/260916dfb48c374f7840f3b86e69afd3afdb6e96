macvlan: Fix potential use-after free for broadcasts

When we postpone a broadcast packet we save the source port in
the skb if it is local.  However, the source port can disappear
before we get a chance to process the packet.

This patch fixes this by holding a ref count on the netdev.

It also delays the skb->cb modification until after we allocate
the new skb as you should not modify shared skbs.
