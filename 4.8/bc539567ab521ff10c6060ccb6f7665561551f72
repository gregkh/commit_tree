ACPI / EC: Remove wrong ECDT correction quirks

Our Windows probe result shows that EC._REG is evaluated after evaluating
all _INI/_STA control methods.

With boot EC always switched in acpi_ec_dsdt_probe(), we can see that as
long as there is no EC opregion accesses in the MLC (module level code, AML
code out of any control methods) and in _INI/_STA, there is no need to make
sure that ECDT must be correct.

Bugs of 9399/12461 were reported against an order issue that BAT0/1._STA
evaluations contain EC accesses while the ECDT setting is wrong.

>From the acpidump output posted on bug 9399, we can see that it is actually
a different issue. In this table, if EC._REG is not executed, EC accesses
will be done in a platform specific manner. As we've already ensured not to
execute EC._REG during the eary stage, we can remove the quirks for bug
9399.

From the acpidump output posted on bug 12461, we can see that it still
needs the quirk. In this table, EC._REG flags a named object whose default
value is One, thus BAT1._STA surely should invoke EC accesses whatever we
invoke EC._REG or not. We have to keep the quirk for it before we can root
cause the issue.
