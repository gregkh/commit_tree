KVM: don't use anon_inode_getfd() before possible failures

Once anon_inode_getfd() has succeeded, it's impossible to undo
in a clean way and no, sys_close() is not usable in such cases.
Use anon_inode_getfile() and get_unused_fd_flags() to get struct file
and descriptor and do *not* install the file into the descriptor table
until after the last possible failure exit.
