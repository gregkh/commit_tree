MIPS: uprobes: fix incorrect uprobe brk handling

When a uprobe-replacement breakpoint instruction is handled, a notifier
is called with DIE_UPROBE argument, but a corresponding exception notify
handler for MIPS attempts to handle DIE_BREAK instead. As a result
the breakpoint instruction isn't handled by the uprobe code and the probed
application terminates with SIGTRAP.
Fix this by changing arch_uprobe_exception_notify code to handle
DIE_UPROBE as a pre-singlestep condition instead of DIE_BREAK.
