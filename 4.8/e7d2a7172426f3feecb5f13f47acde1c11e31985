drm/i915: Unduplicate CHV pre-encoder enabling phy logic

The only difference between the DP and HDMI versions was the lane count.
Since lane_count is now set appropriately for HDMI too, get rid of the
duplication and move this to intel_dpio_phy.c

v2: Don't move comments about 2nd common lane staying alive. (Ville)
