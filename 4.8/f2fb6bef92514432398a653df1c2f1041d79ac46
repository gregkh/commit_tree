perf/core: Optimize side-band event delivery

The perf_event_aux() function iterates all PMUs and all events in
their respective per-CPU contexts to find the events to deliver
side-band records to.

For example, the brk test case in lkp triggers many mmap() operations,
which, if we're also running perf, results in many perf_event_aux()
invocations.

If we enable uncore PMU support (even when uncore events are not used),
dozens of uncore PMUs will be iterated, which can significantly
decrease brk_test's throughput.

For example, the brk throughput:

  without uncore PMUs: 2647573 ops_per_sec
  with    uncore PMUs: 1768444 ops_per_sec

... a 33% reduction.

To get at the per-CPU events that need side-band records, this patch
puts these events on a per-CPU list, this avoids iterating the PMUs
and any events that do not need side-band records.

Per task events are unchanged to avoid extra overhead on the context
switch paths.
