iommu/rockchip: Fix devm_{request,free}_irq parameter

Even though the IOMMU shares IRQ with its master, the struct device
passed to {request,free}_irq is supposed to represent the device that is
signalling the interrupt. This patch makes the driver use IOMMU device
instead of master's device to make things clear.
