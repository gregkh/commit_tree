efi / ACPI: load SSTDs from EFI variables

This patch allows SSDTs to be loaded from EFI variables. It works by
specifying the EFI variable name containing the SSDT to be loaded. All
variables with the same name (regardless of the vendor GUID) will be
loaded.

Note that we can't use acpi_install_table and we must rely on the
dynamic ACPI table loading and bus re-scanning mechanisms. That is
because I2C/SPI controllers are initialized earlier then the EFI
subsystems and all I2C/SPI ACPI devices are enumerated when the
I2C/SPI controllers are initialized.
