drm/i915/gen9: Drop invalid WARN() during data rate calculation

It's possible to have a non-zero plane mask and still wind up with a
total data rate of zero.  There are two cases where this can happen:

 * planes are active (from the KMS point of view), but are
   all fully clipped (positioned offscreen)
 * the only active plane on a CRTC is the cursor (which is handled
   independently and not counted into the general data rate computations

These are both valid display setups (although unusual), so we need to
drop the WARN().
