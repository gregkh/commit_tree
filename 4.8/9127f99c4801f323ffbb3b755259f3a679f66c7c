drm/rockchip: Finish initialization before registering DRM device

Currently the driver calls drm_dev_register() directly after allocating
the DRM device and then continues with further initialization. This is
incorrect, because drm_dev_register() is supposed to be called after all
initialization is done. This problem was masked by the fact that
drm_dev_register() did not use to do anything special before, but
recently it started to call drm_connector_register_all(), which leads to
a crash if the driver is not fully initialized.

This patch fixes the problem by moving the call to drm_dev_register() to
the end of the initialization sequence and also removing the, now
unnecessary, call to drm_connector_register_all() from driver code.
