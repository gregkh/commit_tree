procfs: avoid 32-bit time_t in /proc/*/stat

/proc/stat shows (among lots of other things) the current boottime (i.e.
number of seconds since boot).  While a 32-bit number is sufficient for
this particular case, we want to get rid of the 'struct timespec'
suffers from a 32-bit overflow in 2038.

This changes the code to use a struct timespec64, which is known to be
safe in all cases.
