mlxsw: spectrum: Add missing flood to router port

In case we have a layer 3 interface on top of a bridge (VLAN / FID RIF),
then we should flood the following packet types to the router:

* Broadcast: If DIP is the broadcast address of the interface, then we
need to be able to get it to CPU by trapping it following route lookup.

* Reserved IP multicast (224.0.0.X): Some control packets (e.g. OSPF)
use this range and are trapped in the router block.
