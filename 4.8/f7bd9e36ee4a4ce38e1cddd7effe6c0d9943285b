bpf: reject wrong sized filters earlier

Add a bpf_check_basics_ok() and reject filters that are of invalid
size much earlier, so we don't do any useless work such as invoking
bpf_prog_alloc(). Currently, rejection happens in bpf_check_classic()
only, but it's really unnecessarily late and they should be rejected
at earliest point. While at it, also clean up one bpf_prog_size() to
make it consistent with the remaining invocations.
