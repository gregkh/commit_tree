perf tools: Sync copy of syscall_64.tbl with the kernel

Noticed by the build system, that emitted this warning:

  Warning: x86_64's syscall_64.tbl differs from kernel

This was due to the wiring up of the recently added preadv2 & pwritev2
syscalls to the compat code, which hadn't been done by the patch
introducing those syscalls: 4babf2c5efb7 ("x86: wire up preadv2 and
pwritev2").

The patch doing the compat wiring was:

  482dd2ef1244 ("x86/syscalls: Wire up compat readv2/writev2 syscalls")

This just silences the perf build warning, as compat syscalls still
can't be supported in 'perf traceÂ´ due to limitations in the
raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit} tracepoints it relies on.
