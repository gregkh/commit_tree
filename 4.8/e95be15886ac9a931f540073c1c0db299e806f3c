[media] dvb: use ktime_t for internal timeout

The dvb demuxer code uses a 'struct timespec' to pass a timeout
as absolute time. This will cause problems on 32-bit architectures
in 2038 when time_t overflows, and it is racy with a concurrent
settimeofday() call.

This patch changes the code to use ktime_get() instead, using
the monotonic time base to avoid both the race and the overflow.
