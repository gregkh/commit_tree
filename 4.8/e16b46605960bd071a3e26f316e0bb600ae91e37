PCI: Allow additional bus numbers for hotplug bridges

A user may hot add a switch requiring more than one bus to enumerate.  This
previously required a system reboot if BIOS did not sufficiently pad the
bus resource, which they frequently don't do.

Add a kernel parameter so a user can specify the minimum number of bus
numbers to reserve for a hotplug bridge's subordinate buses so rebooting
won't be necessary.

The default is 1, which is equivalent to previous behavior.
