perf/x86/intel: Don't disable "intel_bts" around "intel" event batching

At the moment, intel_bts events get disabled from intel PMU's disable
callback, which includes event scheduling transactions of said PMU,
which have nothing to do with intel_bts events.

We do want to keep intel_bts events off inside the PMI handler to
avoid filling up their buffer too soon.

This patch moves intel_bts enabling/disabling directly to the PMI
handler.
