Revert "af_unix: Fix splice-bind deadlock"

This reverts commit c845acb324aa85a39650a14e7696982ceea75dc1.

It turns out that it just replaces one deadlock with another one: we can
still get the wrong lock ordering with the readlock due to overlayfs
calling back into the filesystem layer and still taking the vfs locks
after the readlock.

The proper solution ends up being to just split the readlock into two
pieces: the bind lock (taken *outside* the vfs locks) and the IO lock
(taken *inside* the filesystem locks).  The two locks are independent
anyway.
