KVM: s390: vsie: initial support for nested virtualization

This patch adds basic support for nested virtualization on s390x, called
VSIE (virtual SIE) and allows it to be used by the guest if the necessary
facilities are supported by the hardware and enabled for the guest.

In order to make this work, we have to shadow the sie control block
provided by guest 2. In order to gain some performance, we have to
reuse the same shadow blocks as good as possible. For now, we allow
as many shadow blocks as we have VCPUs (that way, every VCPU can run the
VSIE concurrently).

We have to watch out for the prefix getting unmapped out of our shadow
gmap and properly get the VCPU out of VSIE in that case, to fault the
prefix pages back in. We use the PROG_REQUEST bit for that purpose.

This patch is based on an initial prototype by Tobias Elpelt.
