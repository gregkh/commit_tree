staging: wilc1000: Remove semaphore close_exit_sync

The semaphore 'close_exit_sync' does not serve any purpose other
than delaying the deregistration of the device which it is trying
to protect from shared access. 'up' is called only when a subdevice
is closed and not when it is opened. So, the semaphore count only
goes up when the device is used.
