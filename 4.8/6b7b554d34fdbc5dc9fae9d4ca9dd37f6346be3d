ARM: dts: Remove use of skeleton.dtsi from bcm283x.dtsi

This file is included from DTS files under arch/arm64 too (via
broadcom/bcm2837-rpi-3-b.dts and broadcom/bcm2837.dtsi). There is a desire
not to have skeleton.dtsi for ARM64. See commit 3ebee5a2e141 ("arm64: dts:
kill skeleton.dtsi") for rationale for its removal.

As well as the addition of #*-cells also requires adding the device_type to
the rpi memory node explicitly.

Note that this change results in the removal of an empty /aliases node from
bcm2835-rpi-a.dtb and bcm2835-rpi-a-plus.dtb. I have no hardware to check
if this is a problem or not.

It also results in some reordering of the nodes in the DTBs (the /aliases
and /memory nodes come later). This isn't supposed to matter but, again,
I've no hardware to check if it is true in this particular case.
