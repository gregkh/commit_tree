benet: Replace ndo_add/del_vxlan_port with ndo_add/del_udp_enc_port

This change replaces the network device operations for adding or removing a
VXLAN port with operations that are more generically defined to be used for
any UDP offload port but provide a type.  As such by just adding a line to
verify that the offload type if VXLAN we can maintain the same
functionality.

I have also gone though and removed the BE2NET_VXLAN config option since it
no longer relies on the VXLAN code anyway.
