KVM: VMX: validate individual bits of guest MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL

KVM currently does not check the value written to guest
MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL, though bits corresponding to disabled features
may be set. This patch makes KVM to validate individual bits written to
guest MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL according to enabled features.
