topology/sysfs: provide drawer id and siblings attributes

The s390 cpu topology gained another hierarchy level. The top level is
now called drawer and contains several books. A book used to be the
top level.

In order to expose the cpu topology to user space allow to create new
sysfs attributes dependent on CONFIG_SCHED_DRAWER which an
architecture may define and select.

These additional attributes will be available:

/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/drawer_id
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/drawer_siblings
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/drawer_siblings_list
