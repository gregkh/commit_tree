kmemleak: don't hang if user disables scanning early

If the user tries to disable automatic scanning early in the boot
process using e.g.:

  echo scan=off > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak

then this command will hang until SECS_FIRST_SCAN (= 60) seconds have
elapsed, even though the system is fully initialised.

We can fix this using interruptible sleep and checking if we're supposed
to stop whenever we wake up (like the rest of the code does).
