We should change HS400 mode selection timing to meet JEDEC
specification. The JEDEC 5.1 said that change the frequency to <= 52MHZ
after HS_TIMING switch. Refer to section 6.6.2.3 "HS400" timing mode
selection:
Set the "Timing Interface" parameter in the HS_TIMING[185] field of the
Extended CSD register to 0x1 to switch to High Speed mode and then set
the clock frequency to a value not greater than 52MHZ.
