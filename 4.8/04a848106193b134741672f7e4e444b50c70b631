arm64: mm: avoid fdt_check_header() before the FDT is fully mapped

As reported by Zijun, the fdt_check_header() call in __fixmap_remap_fdt()
is not safe since it is not guaranteed that the FDT header is mapped
completely. Due to the minimum alignment of 8 bytes, the only fields we
can assume to be mapped are 'magic' and 'totalsize'.

Since the OF layer is in charge of validating the FDT image, and we are
only interested in making reasonably sure that the size field contains
a meaningful value, replace the fdt_check_header() call with an explicit
comparison of the magic field's value against the expected value.
