clk: tegra: remove TEGRA_PLL_USE_LOCK for PLLD/PLLD2

Tegra114 has a HW bug that the PLLD/PLLD2 lock bit cannot be asserted when
the DIS power domain is during up-powergating process but the clamp to this
domain is not removed yet. That causes a timeout and aborts the power
sequence, although the PLLD/PLLD2 has already locked. To remove the false
alarm, we don't use the lock for PLLD/PLLD2. Just wait 1ms and treat the
clocks as locked.
