NVMe: Expose ns wwid through single sysfs entry

The method to uniquely identify a namespace depends on the controller's
specification revision level and implemented capabilities. This patch
has the driver figure this out and exports the unique string through a
single 'wwid' attribute so the user doesn't have this burden.

The longest namespace unique identifier is used if available. If not
available, the driver will concat the controller's vendor, serial,
and model with the namespace ID. The specification provides this as a
unique indentifier.
