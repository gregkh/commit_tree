clk: sunxi: factors: Support custom formulas

Some clocks cannot be modelled using the standard factors clk formula,
such as clocks with special pre-dividers on one parent, or clocks
with all power-of-two dividers.

Add support for a custom .recalc callback for factors clk. Also pass
the current parent index to the .get_factor and .recalc callbacks.
