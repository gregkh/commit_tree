rtc: ds1307: add support for the DT property 'wakeup-source'

For RTC chips with no IRQ directly connected to the SoC, the RTC chip
can be forced as a wakeup source by stating that explicitly in
the device's .dts file using the "wakeup-source" boolean property.
This will guarantee the 'wakealarm' sysfs entry is available on the
device, if supported by the RTC.

With these changes to the driver rtc-ds1307 and the necessary entries
in the .dts file, I get an working ds1337 RTC on the Witty Pi extension
board by UUGear for the Raspberry Pi.

An example for the entry in the .dts file:

	rtc: ds1337@68 {
		compatible = "dallas,ds1337";
		reg = <0x68>;
		wakeup-source;

If the "wakeup-source" property is set, do not request an IRQ.
Set also UIE mode to unsupported, to get a working 'hwclock' binary.
