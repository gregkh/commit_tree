[media] soc_camera/omap1: move to staging in preparation for removal

This driver is deprecated: it needs to be converted to vb2 and
it should become a stand-alone driver instead of using the
soc-camera framework.

Unless someone is willing to take this on (unlikely with such
ancient hardware) it is going to be removed from the kernel
soon.
