perf build: Fix feature-dump checks, we need to test all features

I see problem with test-all case speedup, because it does not
comprise checks for 32bits compilations, fix it.

The problem could be noticed by calling:

  make -C tools/perf feature-dump

That would end up misdetecting the feature-compile-x32, that, building
using 'gcc -mx32' needs stub headers not present in a fedora 23 devel
machine and thus fail to compile, but ended up appearing as detected,
i.e. present in tools/perf/FEATURE-DUMP as 'feature-compile-x32=1'.

With this fix it correctly appears as 'feature-compile-x32=0' and if we
uninstall the libc devel files for 32 bits (glibc-devel.i686), then the
relevant variable is flipped from 'feature-compile-32=1' to
'feature-compile-32=0'.

The same things happened for bionic and libbabeltrace, that were
misdetected because the are no tested in test-all.c
