coresight: etm3x: adding operation mode for etm_enable()

Adding a new mode to source API enable() in order to
distinguish where the request comes from.  That way it is
possible to perform different operations based on where
the request was issued from.

The ETM4x driver is also modified to keep in sync with the
new interface.
