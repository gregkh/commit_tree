MIPS: ath79: Fix the ar724x clock calculation

According to the AR7242 datasheet section 2.8, AR724X CPUs use a 40MHz
input clock as the REF_CLK instead of 5MHz.

The correct CPU PLL calculation procedure is as follows:
CPU_PLL = (FB * REF_CLK) / REF_DIV / 2.

This patch is compatible with the current calculation procedure with
default FB and REF_DIV values.

Tested on AR7240, AR7241 and AR7242.
