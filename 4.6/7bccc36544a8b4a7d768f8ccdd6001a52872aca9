n_tty: Fix stuck write wakeup

If signal-driven i/o is disabled while write wakeup is pending (ie.,
n_tty_write() has set TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP but then signal-driven i/o
is disabled), the TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP bit will never be cleared and
will cause tty_wakeup() to always call n_tty_write_wakeup.

Unconditionally clear the write wakeup, and since kill_fasync()
already checks if the fasync ptr is null, call kill_fasync()
unconditionally as well.
