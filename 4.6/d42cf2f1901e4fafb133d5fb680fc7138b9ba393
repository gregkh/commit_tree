crypto: sahara - fill the statesize field

Currently the sahara driver fails to probe:

sahara: probe of 63ff8000.crypto failed with error -22

This happens since commit 8996eafdcbad ("crypto: ahash - ensure statesize
is non-zero"), which requires statesize to be filled.

Pass the statesize members for sha1 and sha256, so we can probe
the driver successfully again.
