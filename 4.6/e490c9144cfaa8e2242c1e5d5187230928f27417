tty: Add software emulated RS485 support for 8250

Implementation of software emulation of RS485 direction handling is based
on omap_serial driver.
Before and after transmission RTS is set to the appropriate value.

Note that before calling serial8250_em485_init() the caller has to
ensure that UART will interrupt when shift register empty. Otherwise,
emultaion cannot be used.

Both serial8250_em485_init() and serial8250_em485_destroy() are
idempotent functions.
