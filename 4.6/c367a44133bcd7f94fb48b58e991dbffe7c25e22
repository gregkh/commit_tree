powerpc/mm: add _PAGE_HASHPTE similar to 4K hash

We don't need to update linux page table entry with _PAGE_HASHPTE early
in hash pte fault. A parallel pte update will loop via _PAGE_BUSY
and look at _PAGE_HASHPTE for a required hpte flush only if
_PAGE_BUSY is cleared. That ensures a pte update will wait for a
parallel hpte insert to finish before looking at _PAGE_HASHPTE bit.

To avoid further confusion drop setting _PAGE_HASHPTE in cmpxchg in __hash_page_4K.

commit 41743a4e34f0 ("powerpc: Free a PTE bit on ppc64 with 64K pages")
did similar change for 64K config
