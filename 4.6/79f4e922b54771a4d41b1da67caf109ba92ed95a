ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Create widget/route based on nodes enumerated

In skylake, HDMI codec enumerates 3 pins and 3 cvts. Stream can
be routed from any cvt to any pin based on the connection list
queried from the pin.

This patch removes the static modelling of widget/route and
creates it dynamically based on the codec widgets enumerated.

Mux widgets are added to represent the map between a cvt and pin.
Ideally the mux widgets should be created based on the connection
list queried from the pin widget. But due to HW behavior, if an
external display is not connected on a port, querying the
connection list returns zero. So create mux widgets to map all
the cvt to all pins. At runtime, playback support on a pin can be
verified based on the connection list query.

Few function in driver have additional arguments now to support
this.
