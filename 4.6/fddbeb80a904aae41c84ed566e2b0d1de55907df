scsi: mvumi: use __maybe_unused to hide pm functions

The mvumi scsi hides the references to its suspend/resume functions in
an #ifdef but does not hide the implementation the same way:

drivers/scsi/mvumi.c:2632:12: error: 'mvumi_suspend' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
drivers/scsi/mvumi.c:2651:12: error: 'mvumi_resume' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

This adds __maybe_unused annotations so the compiler knows it can
silently drop them instead of warning, while avoiding the addition of
another #ifdef.
