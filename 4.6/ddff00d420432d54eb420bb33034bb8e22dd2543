net: Move skb_has_shared_frag check out of GRE code and into segmentation

The call skb_has_shared_frag is used in the GRE path and skb_checksum_help
to verify that no frags can be modified by an external entity.  This check
really doesn't belong in the GRE path but in the skb_segment function
itself.  This way any protocol that might be segmented will be performing
this check before attempting to offload a checksum to software.
