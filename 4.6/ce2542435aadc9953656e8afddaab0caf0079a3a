rtlwifi: pass struct rtl_stats by reference as it is more efficient

passing rtl_stats by value is inefficient; the structure is over 300
bytes in size and generally just one field (packet_report_type)
is being accessed, so the pass by value is a relatively large overhead.
This change just affects just the rx_command_packet calls.
