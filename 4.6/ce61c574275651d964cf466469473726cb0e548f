mpt3sas: Used IEEE SGL instead of MPI SGL while framing a SMP Passthrough request message.

As driver was using MPI SGL while framing the SMP Passthrough request
message due to which firmware unable to post the Reply Data in the host
memory and timeout is observed for this SMP Passthrough request message
and so unable to perform phy disable operation.
