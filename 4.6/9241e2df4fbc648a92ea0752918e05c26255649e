vlan: pull on __vlan_insert_tag error path and fix csum correction

When __vlan_insert_tag() fails from skb_vlan_push() path due to the
skb_cow_head(), we need to undo the __skb_push() in the error path
as well that was done earlier to move skb->data pointer to mac header.

Moreover, I noticed that when in the non-error path the __skb_pull()
is done and the original offset to mac header was non-zero, we fixup
from a wrong skb->data offset in the checksum complete processing.

So the skb_postpush_rcsum() really needs to be done before __skb_pull()
where skb->data still points to the mac header start and thus operates
under the same conditions as in __vlan_insert_tag().
