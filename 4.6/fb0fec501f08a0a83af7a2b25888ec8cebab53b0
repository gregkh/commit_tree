mm: Export nr_swap_pages

Some modules, like i915.ko, use swappable objects and may try to swap
them out under memory pressure (via the shrinker). Before doing so, they
want to check using get_nr_swap_pages() to see if any swap space is
available as otherwise they will waste time purging the object from the
device without recovering any memory for the system. This requires the
nr_swap_pages counter to be exported to the modules.
