ASoC: Intel: common: filter ACPI devices with _STA return value

BIOS vendors typically list multiple audio codecs in the DSDT
table and enable the relevant one by changing the return value
of the _STA method.

With the current code, all devices are reported by
acpi_dev_present(), regardless of the _STA return values. This
causes errors on probe with the wrong machine driver being loaded.

This patch essentially reverts 'commit 6f08cbdaac5a
("ASoC: Intel: Use acpi_dev_present()")' and adds code to
force the evaluation of the _STA method.

A better solution might be to make sure the ACPI subsystem only
reports devices with a _STA value of 0xf but apparently it's
problematic so dealing with this in the audio subsystem directly.
