crypto: ccp - memset request context to zero during import

Since a crypto_ahash_import() can be called against a request context
that has not had a crypto_ahash_init() performed, the request context
needs to be cleared to insure there is no random data present. If not,
the random data can result in a kernel oops during crypto_ahash_update().
