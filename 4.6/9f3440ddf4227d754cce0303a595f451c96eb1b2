ARM: dts: vf610-colibri: relicense vf*colibri* under GPLv2/X11

GPLv2-only devicetrees make reuse difficult for software components
licensed under a different license.

The consensus is that a GPL/X11 dual-license should allow all necessary
uses, so relicense the vf*colibri* files to this combination.

CCs were acquired using:
git shortlog -sne --no-merges arch/arm/boot/dts/vf*colibri*
