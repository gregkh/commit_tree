drm/i915/bios: have get_blocksize() support MIPI sequence block v3+

Have get_blocksize() support the special case of MIPI sequence block v3+
which has a separate field for size. Provide and use abstractions for
getting the blocksize given a pointer to the block "envelope",
i.e. pointer to the block id, and given a pointer to the block payload
data.
