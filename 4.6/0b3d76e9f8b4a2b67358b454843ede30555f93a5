ath10k: rename Mesh related service names

WMI_10_4_SERVICE_MESH bit is for non IEEE802.11s Mesh.
Hence rename it to WMI_10_4_SERVICE_MESH_NON_11S.
Also add _11S as post-fix to each of WMI_SERVICE_MESH and
WMI_VDEV_SUBTYPE_MESH specifying the service is for 11s Mesh.
This will help users to distinguish 11s Mesh from non 11s Mesh.
