lwtunnel: autoload of lwt modules

The lwt implementations using net devices can autoload using the
existing mechanism using IFLA_INFO_KIND. However, there's no mechanism
that lwt modules not using net devices can use.

Therefore, add the ability to autoload modules registering lwt
operations for lwt implementations not using a net device so that
users don't have to manually load the modules.

Only users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can cause modules to be
loaded, which is ensured by rtnetlink_rcv_msg rejecting non-RTM_GETxxx
messages for users without this capability, and by
lwtunnel_build_state not being called in response to RTM_GETxxx
messages.
