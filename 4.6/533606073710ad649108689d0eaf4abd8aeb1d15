staging: fsl-mc: Avoid section mismatch

The fsl_mc_allocator_driver_exit() function is marked __exit, but is
called by the error handling code in fsl_mc_allocator_driver_init().
This results in a section mismatch, which in turn could lead to
executing random code.

Remove the __exit annotation to fix this.
