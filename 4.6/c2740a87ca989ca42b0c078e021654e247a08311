perf thread: Rename perf_event__preprocess_sample_addr to thread__resolve

Since none of the perf_event fields are used anymore, just the
perf_sample ones, and since this resolves to (map, symbol) from data
structures within struct thread, rename it to thread__resolve and make
the argument ordering similar to the one in machine__resolve().
