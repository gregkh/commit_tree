arm64: pgtable: implement static [pte|pmd|pud]_offset variants

The page table accessors pte_offset(), pud_offset() and pmd_offset()
rely on __va translations, so they can only be used after the linear
mapping has been installed. For the early fixmap and kasan init routines,
whose page tables are allocated statically in the kernel image, these
functions will return bogus values. So implement pte_offset_kimg(),
pmd_offset_kimg() and pud_offset_kimg(), which can be used instead
before any page tables have been allocated dynamically.
