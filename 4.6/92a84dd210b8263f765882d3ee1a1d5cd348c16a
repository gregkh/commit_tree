documentation: Subsequent writes ordered by rcu_dereference()

The current memory-barriers.txt does not address the possibility of
a write to a dereferenced pointer.  This should be rare, but when it
happens, we need that write -not- to be clobbered by the initialization.
This commit therefore adds an example showing a data dependency ordering
a later data-dependent write.
