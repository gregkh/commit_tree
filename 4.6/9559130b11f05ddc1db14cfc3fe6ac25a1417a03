ACPICA: ACPICA: Tune _REG evaluations order in the initialization steps

ACPICA commit 77e0c7a482ac30ef857cf3c33d075e5fe5b5e449

This patch tunes _REG evaluations to be later than all table loading
facilities:
1. acpi_load_tables(): _REG is currently invoked after this function.
2. acpi_ns_exec_module_code_list(): this executes module level code, the
   execution should be a part of the table loading while we currently
   support this in a deferred way.
3. acpi_ns_initialize_objects(): this parses Region/Field/Buffer/Package where
   pkg_length primitive can be seen in the grammar, the parsing should be a
   part of the table loading while we currently support this in a deferred
   way.
Control method evaluation should happen after loading the tables. So this
patch changes the order of _REG evaluation when
acpi_gbl_group_module_level_code experiment is enabled. Lv Zheng.
