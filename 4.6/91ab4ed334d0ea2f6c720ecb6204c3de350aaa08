staging/rdma/hfi1: Implement LED beaconing for maintenance

This patch implements LED beaconing for maintenance. A MAD packet with
the LEDInfo attribute set to 1 will enable LED beaconing with a duty
cycle of 2s on and 1.5s off. A MAD packet with the LEDInfo attribute
set to 0 will disable beaconing and return the LED to normal operation.
