staging/rdma/hfi1: Correctly set RcvCtxtCtrl register

The RcvCtxtCtrl register was being incorrectly set upon context
initialization and clean up resulting, in many cases, of contexts using
settings from previous contexts' initialization. This resulted in bad
and unexpected behavior. This was especially important for the TailUpd
bit, which requires special handling and if set incorrectly could lead
to severely degraded performance.

This patch fixes the handling of the RcvCtxtCtrl register, ensuring that
each context gets initialized with settings applicable only for that
context. It also ensures the proper setting for the TailUpd bit by
setting it to either 0 or 1 (as needed by the context's configuration)
explicitly.
