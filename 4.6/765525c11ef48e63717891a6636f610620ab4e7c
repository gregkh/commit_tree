IB/rdmavt: Add query and modify port stubs

This patch adds the query and modify port stubs. The query will mostly
entail the driver returning everything in the ib_port_attr which will get
handed back to the verbs layer. The modify will need some API helpers in
the driver. The send_trap and post_mad_send are still issues to address.
