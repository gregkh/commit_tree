hrtimer: Revert CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW support

Revert commits:
a6e707ddbdf1: KVM: arm/arm64: timer: Switch to CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
9006a01829a5: hrtimer: Catch illegal clockids
9c808765e88e: hrtimer: Add support for CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW

Marc found out, that there are fundamental issues with that patch series
because __hrtimer_get_next_event() and hrtimer_forward() need support for
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW. Nothing which is easily fixed, so revert the whole lot.
