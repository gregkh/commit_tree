perf tools: Use readdir() instead of deprecated readdir_r()

The readdir() function is thread safe as long as just one thread uses a
DIR, which is the case when parsing tracepoint event definitions, to
avoid breaking the build with glibc-2.23.90 (upcoming 2.24), use it
instead of readdir_r().

See: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readdir.3.html

"However, in modern implementations (including the glibc implementation),
concurrent calls to readdir() that specify different directory streams
are thread-safe.  In cases where multiple threads must read from the
same directory stream, using readdir() with external synchronization is
still preferable to the use of the deprecated readdir_r(3) function."

Noticed while building on a Fedora Rawhide docker container.
