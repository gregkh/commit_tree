libnvdimm, nfit: centralize command status translation

The return value from an 'ndctl_fn' reports the command execution
status, i.e. was the command properly formatted and was it successfully
submitted to the bus provider.  The new 'cmd_rc' parameter allows the bus
provider to communicate command specific results, translated into
common error codes.

Convert the ARS commands to this scheme to:

1/ Consolidate status reporting

2/ Prepare for for expanding ars unit test cases

3/ Make the implementation more generic
