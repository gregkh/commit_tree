perf tools: Dont stop PMU parsing on alias parse error

When an error happens during alias parsing currently the complete
parsing of all attributes of the PMU is stopped. This is breaks old perf
on a newer kernel that may have not-yet-know alias attributes (such as
.scale or .per-pkg).

Continue when some attribute is unparseable.

This is IMHO a stable candidate and should be backported to older
versions to avoid problems with newer kernels.

v2: Print warnings when something goes wrong.
v3: Change warning to debug output
