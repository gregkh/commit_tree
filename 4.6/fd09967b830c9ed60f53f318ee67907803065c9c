Hi Herbert,

Yeah I just realized that the call to crypto_shash_init() isn't necessary
here. What it does is overwritten by crypto_ahash_import(). But this desc
still needs to be initialized here because it's newly allocated by
ahash_request_alloc(). We eventually calls the shash version of import()
which needs desc as an argument. The real context to be imported is then
derived from shash_desc_ctx(desc).

desc is a sub-field of struct mcryptd_hash_request_ctx, which is again a
sub-field of the bigger blob allocated by ahash_request_alloc(). The entire
blob's size is set in sha1_mb_async_init_tfm(). So a better version is as
follows:

(just removed the call to crypto_shash_init())

Subject: [PATCH v2 1/4] crypto x86/sha1_mb: Fix load failure

modprobe sha1_mb fails with the following message:

modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'sha1_mb': No such device

It is because it needs to set its statesize and implement its
import() and export() interface.

v2: remove redundant call to crypto_shash_init()
