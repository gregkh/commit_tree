x86/entry/compat: Keep TS_COMPAT set during signal delivery

Signal delivery needs to know the sign of an interrupted syscall's
return value in order to detect -ERESTART variants.  Normally this
works independently of bitness because syscalls internally return
long.  Under ptrace, however, this can break, and syscall_get_error
is supposed to sign-extend regs->ax if needed.

We were clearing TS_COMPAT too early, though, and this prevented
sign extension, which subtly broke syscall restart under ptrace.
