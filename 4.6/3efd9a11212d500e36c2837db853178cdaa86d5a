IB/mlx5: Modify MAD reading counters method to use counter registers

Modify mlx5_ib_process_mad to use PPCNT and query_vport commands
instead of MAD_IFC, as MAD_IFC is deprecated on new firmware
versions (and doesn't support RoCE anyway).

Traffic counters exist in both 32-bit and 64-bit forms.
Declaring support of extended coutners results in traffic counters
to be read in their 64-bit form only via the query_vport command.
Error counters exist only in 32-bit form and read via PPCNT command.

This commit also adds counters support in RoCE.
