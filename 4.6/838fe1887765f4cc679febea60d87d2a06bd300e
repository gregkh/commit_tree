btrfs: cleaner_kthread() doesn't need explicit freeze

cleaner_kthread() is not marked freezable, and therefore calling
try_to_freeze() in its context is a pointless no-op.

In addition to that, as has been clearly demonstrated by 80ad623edd2d
("Revert "btrfs: clear PF_NOFREEZE in cleaner_kthread()"), it's perfectly
valid / legal for cleaner_kthread() to stay scheduled out in an arbitrary
place during suspend (in that particular example that was waiting for
reading of extent pages), so there is no need to leave any traces of
freezer in this kthread.
