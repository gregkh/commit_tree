cgroup: explicitly track whether a cgroup_subsys_state is visible to userland

Currently, whether a css (cgroup_subsys_state) has its interface files
created is not tracked and assumed to change together with the owning
cgroup's lifecycle.  cgroup directory and interface creation is being
separated out from internal object creation to help refactoring and
eventually allow cgroups which are not visible through cgroupfs.

This patch adds CSS_VISIBLE to track whether a css has its interface
files created and perform management operations only when necessary
which helps decoupling interface file handling from internal object
lifecycle.  After this patch, all css interface file management
functions can be called regardless of the current state and will
achieve the expected result.
