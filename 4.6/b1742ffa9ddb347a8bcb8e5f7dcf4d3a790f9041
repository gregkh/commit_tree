  - (ENG) http://www.buffalotech.com/products/network-storage/linkstation/linkstation-pro

This device tree is based on the board file:
  arch/arm/mach-orion5x/kurobox_pro-setup.c
However, that board file also support Kurobox Pro, which is not supported by
device tree yet. So the board file is not removed.
