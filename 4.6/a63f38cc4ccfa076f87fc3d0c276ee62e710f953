locking/lockdep: Convert hash tables to hlists

Mike said:

: CONFIG_UBSAN_ALIGNMENT breaks x86-64 kernel with lockdep enabled, i.e.
: kernel with CONFIG_UBSAN_ALIGNMENT=y fails to load without even any error
: message.
:
: The problem is that ubsan callbacks use spinlocks and might be called
: before lockdep is initialized.  Particularly this line in the
: reserve_ebda_region function causes problem:
:
: lowmem = *(unsigned short *)__va(BIOS_LOWMEM_KILOBYTES);
:
: If i put lockdep_init() before reserve_ebda_region call in
: x86_64_start_reservations kernel loads well.

Fix this ordering issue permanently: change lockdep so that it uses hlists
for the hash tables.  Unlike a list_head, an hlist_head is in its
initialized state when it is all-zeroes, so lockdep is ready for operation
immediately upon boot - lockdep_init() need not have run.

The patch will also save some memory.

Probably lockdep_init() and lockdep_initialized can be done away with now.
