scsi_dh: force modular build if SCSI is a module

When the scsi_dh core was moved into the scsi core module,
CONFIG_SCSI_DH became a 'bool' option, and now anything depending on it
can be built-in even when CONFIG_SCSI=m. This of course cannot link
successfully:

drivers/scsi/built-in.o: In function `rdac_init':
scsi_dh_alua.c:(.init.text+0x14): undefined reference to `scsi_register_device_handler'
scsi_dh_alua.c:(.init.text+0x64): undefined reference to `scsi_unregister_device_handler'
drivers/scsi/built-in.o: In function `alua_init':
scsi_dh_alua.c:(.init.text+0xb0): undefined reference to `scsi_register_device_handler'

As a workaround, this adds an extra dependency on CONFIG_SCSI, so
Kconfig can figure out whether built-in is allowed or not.
