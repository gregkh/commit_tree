xfs: fix computation of inode btree maxlevels

Commit 88740da18[1] introduced a function to compute the maximum
height of the inode btree back in 1994.  Back then, apparently, the
freespace and inode btrees shared the same geometry; however, it has
long since been the case that the inode and freespace btrees have
different record and key sizes.  Therefore, we must use m_inobt_mnr if
we want a correct calculation/log reservation/etc.

(Yes, this bug has been around for 21 years and ten months.)

(Yes, I was in middle school when this bug was committed.)
