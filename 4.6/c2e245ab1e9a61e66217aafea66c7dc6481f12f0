i40e/i40evf: try again after failure

This is the "Don't Give Up" patch.  Previously the
driver could fail an allocation, and then possibly stall
a queue forever, by never coming back to continue receiving
or allocating buffers.

With this patch, the driver will keep polling trying to allocate
receive buffers until it succeeds.  This should keep all receive
queues running even in the face of memory pressure.

Also update copyright year in file header.
