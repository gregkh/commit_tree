ASoC: Intel: common: add translation from HID to codec-name

BIOS vendors sometimes declare multiple devices in the DSDT
table that all refer to the same HID. This is not very smart
but not illegal as long as only one device reports present with
the _STA method. The ACPI subsystem tracks each device with an
extension, e.g. 10EC5640:00 and 10EC5640:01

In the ASoC machine driver, the DAI codec name needs to refer to the
ACPI device that reported present, e.g. "i2c-10EC5640:01". The
extension will vary depending on how the BIOS is written and which
ACPI device is activated.

This patch adds a translation function that provides the codec
name from the ACPI HID to avoid any hard-coded values in the
machine driver.
