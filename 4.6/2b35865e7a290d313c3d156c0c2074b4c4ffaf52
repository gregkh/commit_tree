scsi_dh_alua: Recheck state on unit attention

When we receive a unit attention code of 'ALUA state changed'
we should recheck the state, as it might be due to an implicit
ALUA state transition. This allows us to return NEEDS_RETRY
instead of ADD_TO_MLQUEUE, allowing to terminate the retries
after a certain time.
At the same time a workqueue item might already be queued, which
should be started immediately to avoid any delays.
