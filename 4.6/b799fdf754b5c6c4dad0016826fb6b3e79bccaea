scsi: ufs: add device quirk delay before putting UFS rails in LPM

We put the UFS device in sleep state & UFS link in hibern8 state during
runtime suspend. After this we put all the UFS rails in low power
modes immediately but it seems some devices may still draw more than
sleep current from UFS rails (especially from VCCQ rail) at-least for
500us.
To avoid this situation, this change adds 2ms delay before putting
these UFS rails in LPM mode.
