serial: atmel: Use atmel_port consistently

In all functions other than atmel_serial_probe_fifos,
atmel_serial_probe, and atmel_console_init, the name "port" is used to
refer to an instance of struct uart_port. In many of these functions,
"atmel_port" is used to refer to an instance of struct atmel_uart_port.

We make the use of the name "port" consistent by making
atmel_serial_probe_fifos, atmel_serial_probe, and atmel_console_init
use "atmel_port" to refer to an instance of struct atmel_uart_port
instead of the previous name of "port".
