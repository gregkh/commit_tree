[media] dvb_frontend: pass the props cache to get_frontend() as arg

Instead of using the DTV properties cache directly, pass the get
frontend data as an argument. For now, everything should remain
the same, but the next patch will prevent get_frontend to
affect the global cache.

This is needed because several drivers don't care enough to only
change the properties if locked. Due to that, calling
G_PROPERTY before locking on those drivers will make them to
never lock. Ok, those drivers are crap and should never be
merged like that, but the core should not rely that the drivers
would be doing the right thing.
