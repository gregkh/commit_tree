mac80211: expose txq queue depth and size to drivers

This will allow drivers to make more educated
decisions whether to defer transmission or not.

Relying on wake_tx_queue() call count implicitly
was not possible because it could be called
without queued frame count actually changing on
software tx aggregation start/stop code paths.

It was also not possible to know how long
byte-wise queue was without dequeueing.
