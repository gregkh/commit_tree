cpufreq: Always update current frequency before startig governor

Make policy->cur match the current frequency returned by the driver's
->get() callback before starting the governor in case they went out of
sync in the meantime and drop the piece of code attempting to
resync policy->cur with the real frequency of the boot CPU from
cpufreq_resume() as it serves no purpose any more (and it's racy and
super-ugly anyway).
