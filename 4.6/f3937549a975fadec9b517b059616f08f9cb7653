rtc: max77686: move initialisation of rtc regmap, irq chip locally

To make RTC block of MAX77686/MAX77802 as independent driver,
move the registration of i2c device, regmap for register access
and irq_chip for interrupt support inside the RTC driver.
Removed the same initialisation from MFD driver.

Having this change will allow to reuse this driver for different
PMIC/devices from Maxim Semiconductor if they kept same RTC IP on
different PMIC. Some of examples as PMIC MAX77620, MAX20024 where
same RTC IP used and hence driver for these chips will use this
driver only for RTC support.
