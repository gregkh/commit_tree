lib/mpi: avoid assembler warning

A wrapper around the umull assembly instruction might reuse
the input register as an output, which is undefined on
some ARM machines, as pointed out by this assembler warning:

  CC      lib/mpi/generic_mpih-mul1.o
/tmp/ccxJuxIy.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/ccxJuxIy.s:53: rdhi, rdlo and rm must all be different
  CC      lib/mpi/generic_mpih-mul2.o
/tmp/ccI0scAD.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/ccI0scAD.s:53: rdhi, rdlo and rm must all be different
  CC      lib/mpi/generic_mpih-mul3.o
/tmp/ccMvVQcp.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/ccMvVQcp.s:53: rdhi, rdlo and rm must all be different

This changes the constraints to force different registers to
be used as output.
