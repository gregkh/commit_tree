serial: earlycon: Fixup earlycon console name and index

Properly initialize the struct console 'name' and 'index' fields for
the registering earlycon. For earlycons w/o trailing numerals, the
index is set to 0; otherwise, the index is set to the value of the
trailing numeral. For example, the 'exynos4210' earlycon name == "exynos"
and index == 4210. Earlycons with embedded numerals will have all
non-trailing numerals as part of the name; for example, the 's3c2412'
earlycon name == "s3c" and index == 2412.

This ackward scheme was initially added for the uart8250 earlycon;
adopt this scheme for the other earlycon "drivers".

Introduce earlycon_init() which performs the string scanning and
initializes the name and index fields; encapsulate the other console
field initializations within.
