qed: Prevent MF link notifications

When device is configured for Multi-function mode, some older management
firmware might incorrectly notify interfaces of link changes while they
haven't requested the physical link configuration to be set.
This can create bizzare race conditions where unloading interfaces are
getting notified that the link is up.

Let the driver compensate - store the logical requested state of the link
and don't propagate notifications after protocol driver explicitly
requires the link to be unset.
