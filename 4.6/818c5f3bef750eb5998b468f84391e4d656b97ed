dm: fix a couple locking issues with use of block interfaces

old_stop_queue() was checking blk_queue_stopped() without holding the
q->queue_lock.

dm_requeue_original_request() needed to check blk_queue_stopped(), with
q->queue_lock held, before calling blk_mq_kick_requeue_list().  And a
side-effect of that change is start_queue() must also call
blk_mq_kick_requeue_list().
