usb: host: ehci-sched: refactor scan_isoc function

This patch removes an infinite 'for' loop and makes use of the already
existing 'restart' tag instead, reducing one leading tab.

The comments and code were corrected conforming file coding style.

Tested by compilation only.
Caught by checkpatch:
 WARNING: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
