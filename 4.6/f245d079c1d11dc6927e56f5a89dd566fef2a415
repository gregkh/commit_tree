net: Allow tunnels to use inner checksum offloads with outer checksums needed

This patch enables us to use inner checksum offloads if provided by
hardware with outer checksums computed by software.

It basically reduces encap_hdr_csum to an advisory flag for now, but based
on the fact that SCTP may be getting segmentation support before long I
thought we may want to keep it as it is possible we may need to support
CRC32c and 1's compliment checksum in the same packet at some point in the
future.
