Revert "sched/fair: Fix fairness issue on migration"

Mike reported that this recent commit:

  3a47d5124a95 ("sched/fair: Fix fairness issue on migration")

... broke interactivity and the signal starvation test.

We have a proper fix series in the works but ran out of time for
v4.6, so revert the commit.
