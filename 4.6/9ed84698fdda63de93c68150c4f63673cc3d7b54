dm cache: make the 'mq' policy an alias for 'smq'

smq seems to be performing better than the old mq policy in all
situations, as well as using a quarter of the memory.

Make 'mq' an alias for 'smq' when choosing a cache policy.  The tunables
that were present for the old mq are faked, and have no effect.  mq
should be considered deprecated now.
