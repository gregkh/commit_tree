staging/rdma/hfi1: Insure last cursor is updated prior to complete

This patch is a prerequisite for adding a separate lock
for post send.

The timing of updating s_last needs to be before returning
any send completion to avoid a race between a poll cq seeing
a completion and the post send checking for a full queue.
