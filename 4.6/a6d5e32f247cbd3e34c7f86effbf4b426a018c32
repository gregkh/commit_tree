iwlwifi: mvm: send large SKBs to the transport

Now that PCIe knows how to create A-MSDUs, use this
capability and prepare SKBs that are large enough to
build an A-MSDU.
Advertise TSO support towards the network stack and
segment the packet with gso_size set to be the maximal
A-MSDU length (after having taken the headers to be added
into account) to make sure that the skb that is passed
down to the transport are not longer than the maximal
A-MSDU allowed.
