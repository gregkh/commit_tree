gpio: present the consumer of a line to userspace

I named the field representing the current user of GPIO line as
"label" but this is too vague and ambiguous. Before anyone gets
confused, rename it to "consumer" and indicate clearly in the
documentation that this is a string set by the user of the line.

Also clean up leftovers in the documentation.
