i40e/i40evf: Fix RSS rx-flow-hash configuration through ethtool

This patch fixes the Hash PCTYPE enable for X722 since it supports
a broader selection of PCTYPES for TCP and UDP.

This patch also fixes a bug in XL710, X710, X722 support for RSS,
as of now we cannot reduce the (4)tuple for RSS for TCP/IPv4/IPV6 or
UDP/IPv4/IPv6 packets since this requires a product feature change
that comes in a later release.

A VF should never be allowed to change the tuples for RSS for any
PCTYPE since that's a global setting for the device in case of i40e
devices.
