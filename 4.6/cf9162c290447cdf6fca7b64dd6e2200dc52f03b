tools build: Check basic headers for test-compile feature checker

An i386 binary can be linked correctly even without correct headers.
Which causes problem. For exmaple:

 $ mv /tmp/oxygen_root/usr/include/gnu/stubs-32.h{,.bak}
 $ make tools/perf
 Auto-detecting system features:
 ...                         dwarf: [ on  ]
 [SNIP]
   GEN      common-cmds.h
   CC       perf-read-vdso32
 In file included from /tmp/oxygen_root/usr/include/features.h:388:0,
                  from /tmp/oxygen_root/usr/include/stdio.h:27,
                  from perf-read-vdso.c:1:
 /tmp/oxygen_root/usr/include/gnu/stubs.h:7:27: fatal error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or directory
  # include <gnu/stubs-32.h>
                           ^
 compilation terminated.
 ...

In this patch we checks not only compiler and linker, but also basic
headers in test-compile test case, make it fail on a platform
lacking correct headers.
