USB: bcma: make helper creating platform dev more generic

Having "bool ohci" argument in bcma_hcd_create_pdev function limited it
to support two cases only (OHCI and EHCI) and put too much logic in it.
Lets make caller pass all required data. This adds few extra arguments
to the function call but will allow us to reuse this code and handle
more cases in the future (e.g. add XHCI support).
