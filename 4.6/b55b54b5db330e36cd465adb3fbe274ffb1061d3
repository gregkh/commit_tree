staging/android: remove struct sync_pt

struct sync_pt was just wrapping around struct fence and creating an
extra abstraction layer. The only two members of struct sync_pt, child_list
and active_list, were moved to struct fence in an earlier commit. After
removing those two members struct sync_pt is nothing more than struct
fence, so remove it all and use struct fence directly.
