pwm: omap-dmtimer: Add sanity checking for load and match values

Add sanity checking to ensure that we do not program load or match values
that are out of range if a user requests period or duty_cycle values which
are not achievable. The match value cannot be less than the load value (but
can be equal), and neither can be 0xffffffff. This means that there must be
at least one fclk cycle between load and match, and another between match
and overflow.
