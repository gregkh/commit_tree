PM / Domains: Restore alignment of slaves in debugfs output

The slave domains are no longer aligned with the table header in the
/sys/kernel/debug/pm_genpd/pm_genpd_summary output. Worse, the alignment
differs depending on the actual name of the state.

Format the state name and index into a buffer, and print that like
before to restore alignment.

Use "%u" for unsigned int while we're at it.
