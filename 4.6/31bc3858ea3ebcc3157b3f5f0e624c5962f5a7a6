memory-hotplug: add automatic onlining policy for the newly added memory

Currently, all newly added memory blocks remain in 'offline' state
unless someone onlines them, some linux distributions carry special udev
rules like:

  SUBSYSTEM=="memory", ACTION=="add", ATTR{state}=="offline", ATTR{state}="online"

to make this happen automatically.  This is not a great solution for
virtual machines where memory hotplug is being used to address high
memory pressure situations as such onlining is slow and a userspace
process doing this (udev) has a chance of being killed by the OOM killer
as it will probably require to allocate some memory.

Introduce default policy for the newly added memory blocks in
/sys/devices/system/memory/auto_online_blocks file with two possible
values: "offline" which preserves the current behavior and "online"
which causes all newly added memory blocks to go online as soon as
they're added.  The default is "offline".
