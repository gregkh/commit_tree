cls_bpf: reset class and reuse major in da

There are two issues with the current code. First one is that we need
to set res->class to 0 in case we use non-default classid matching.

This is important for the case where cls_bpf was initially set up with
an optional binding to a default class with tcf_bind_filter(), where
the underlying qdisc implements bind_tcf() that fills res->class and
tests for it later on when doing the classification. Convention for
these cases is that after tc_classify() was called, such qdiscs (atm,
drr, qfq, cbq, hfsc, htb) first test class, and if 0, then they lookup
based on classid.

Second, there's a bug with da mode, where res->classid is only assigned
a 16 bit minor, but it needs to expand to the full 32 bit major/minor
combination instead, therefore we need to expand with the bound major.
This is fine as classes belonging to a classful qdisc must share the
same major.
