ARM: dts: dm3730-torpedo-devkit: Add "Wireless" to model

LogicPD has two main Torpedo styles, a version with wireless and a version
without wireless.  This version has Bluetooth and WiFi, but there really
isn't an easy way to identify them automatically.  This simply adds
"Wireless" to the model to distinguish it from the 'base' model that will
come soon.
