qede: prevent chip hang when increasing channels

qede requires qed to provide enough resources to accommodate 16 combined
channels, but that upper-bound isn't actually being enforced by it.
Instead, qed inform back to qede how many channels can be opened based on
available resources - but that calculation doesn't really take into account
the resources requested by qede; Instead it considers other FW/HW available
resources.

As a result, if a user would increase the number of channels to more than
16 [e.g., using ethtool] the chip would hang.

This change increments the resources requested by qede to 64 combined
channels instead of 16; This value is an upper bound on the possible
available channels [due to other FW/HW resources].
