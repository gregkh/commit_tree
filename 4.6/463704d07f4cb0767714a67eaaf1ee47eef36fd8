drm/i915/guc: Add GuC ADS - scheduler policies

GuC supports different scheduling policies for its four internal
queues. Currently these have been set to the same default values
as KMD_NORMAL queue.

Particularly POLICY_MAX_NUM_WI is set to 15 to match GuC internal
maximum submit queue numbers to avoid an out-of-space problem.
This value indicates max number of work items allowed to be queued
for one DPC process. A smaller value will let GuC schedule more
frequently while a larger number may increase chances to optimize
cmds (such as collapse cmds from same lrc) with risks that keeps
CS idle.
