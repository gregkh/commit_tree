vfio/pci: Add infrastructure for additional device specific regions

Add support for additional regions with indexes started after the
already defined fixed regions.  Device specific code can register
these regions with the new vfio_pci_register_dev_region() function.
The ops structure per region currently only includes read/write
access and a release function, allowing automatic cleanup when the
device is closed.  mmap support is only missing here because it's
not needed by the first user queued for this support.
