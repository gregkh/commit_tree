resource: Export insert_resource and remove_resource

insert_resource() and remove_resouce() are called by producers
of resources, such as FW modules and bus drivers.  These modules
may be implemented as loadable modules.

Export insert_resource() and remove_resouce() so that they can
be called from such modules.
