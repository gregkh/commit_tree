pinctrl: mediatek: mt8* make driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for these drivers are currently:

config PINCTRL_MT8127
        bool "Mediatek MT8127 pin control" if COMPILE_TEST && !MACH_MT8127

config PINCTRL_MT8135
        bool "Mediatek MT8135 pin control" if COMPILE_TEST && !MACH_MT8135

config PINCTRL_MT8173
        bool "Mediatek MT8173 pin control"

...meaning that they are currently not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

A recent commit moved these from module_init to arch_initcall already, so
the init ordering remains untouched with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.
