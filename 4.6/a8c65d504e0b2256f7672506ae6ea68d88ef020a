mtd: nand: simplify nand_bch_init() usage

nand_bch_init() requires several arguments which could directly be deduced
from the mtd device. Get rid of those useless parameters.

nand_bch_init() is also requiring the caller to provide a proper eccbytes
value, while this value could be deduced from the ecc.size and
ecc.strength value. Fallback to eccbytes calculation when it is set to 0.
