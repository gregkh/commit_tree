dcache.c: new helper: __d_add()

d_add() with inode->i_lock already held; common to d_add() and
d_splice_alias().  All ->lookup() instances that end up hashing
the dentry they are given will hash it here.

This almost completes the preparations to parallel lookups
proper - the only remaining bit is taking security_d_instantiate()
past d_rehash() and doing rehashing without dropping ->d_lock.
