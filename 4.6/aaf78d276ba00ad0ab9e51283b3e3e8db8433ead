drm/i915/fbc: introduce struct intel_fbc_state_cache

Per the new atomic locking rules, we need to cache the CRTC, plane and
FB state structures we use so we can access them later without needing
more locks. So do this.

Notice that there are some pieces of the FBC code that look at things
that are only computed during the modeset, so we can't just can't
precompute whether FBC can be activated during the update_state_cache
stage. We may be able to do this later.
