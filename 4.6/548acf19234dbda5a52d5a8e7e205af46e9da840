x86/mm: Expand the exception table logic to allow new handling options

Huge amounts of help from  Andy Lutomirski and Borislav Petkov to
produce this. Andy provided the inspiration to add classes to the
exception table with a clever bit-squeezing trick, Boris pointed
out how much cleaner it would all be if we just had a new field.

Linus Torvalds blessed the expansion with:

  ' I'd rather not be clever in order to save just a tiny amount of space
    in the exception table, which isn't really criticial for anybody. '

The third field is another relative function pointer, this one to a
handler that executes the actions.

We start out with three handlers:

 1: Legacy - just jumps the to fixup IP
 2: Fault - provide the trap number in %ax to the fixup code
 3: Cleaned up legacy for the uaccess error hack
