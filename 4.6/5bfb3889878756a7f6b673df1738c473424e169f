arm64: Broadcom Vulcan support

Add a configuration option and a device tree for Broadcom's Vulcan
ARM64 processor. vulcan.dtsi has the on-chip blocks like the PCIe
controller, GICv3 with ITS, PMU, system timer and the pl011 UART.
vulcan-eval.dts has definitions for a basic evaluation board.

Vulcan's processor cores support the ARMv8.1 instruction set and
will use "brcm,vulcan" as the compatible property. The firmware
has PSCI 0.2 support for cpu wakeup.
