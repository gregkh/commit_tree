HID: multitouch: force retrieving of Win8 signature blob

The Synaptics 0x11e5 over I2C found in the Asus T100-CHI requires to
fetch the signature blob to actually start sending events.

With this patch, we should be close enough to the Windows driver which
checks the content of the blob at plugin to validate or not the
touchscreen.
