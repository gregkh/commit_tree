perf tools: Fix locale handling in pmu parsing

Ingo reported regression on display format of big numbers, which is
missing separators (in default perf stat output).

 triton:~/tip> perf stat -a sleep 1
         ...
         127008602      cycles                    #    0.011 GHz
         279538533      stalled-cycles-frontend   #  220.09% frontend cycles idle
         119213269      instructions              #    0.94  insn per cycle

This is caused by recent change:

  perf stat: Check existence of frontend/backed stalled cycles

that added call to pmu_have_event, that subsequently calls
perf_pmu__parse_scale, which has a bug in locale handling.

The lc string returned from setlocale, that we use to store old locale
value, may be allocated in static storage. Getting a dynamic copy to
make it survive another setlocale call.

  $ perf stat ls
         ...
         2,360,602      cycles                    #    3.080 GHz
         2,703,090      instructions              #    1.15  insn per cycle
           546,031      branches                  #  712.511 M/sec

Committer note:

Since the patch introducing the regression didn't made to perf/core,
move it to just before where the regression was introduced, so that we
don't break bisection for this feature.
