arm64: dts: juno/vexpress: fix node name unit-address presence warnings

Commit fa38a82096a1 ("scripts/dtc: Update to upstream version
53bf130b1cdd") added warnings on node name unit-address presence/absence
mismatch in device trees.

This patch fixes those warning on all the juno/vexpress platforms where
unit-address is present in node name while the reg/ranges property is
not present. It also adds unit-address to all smb bus node.
