efi/arm: Check for LPAE support before booting a LPAE kernel

A kernel built with support for LPAE cannot boot to a state where it
can inform the user about if it has to fail due to missing LPAE support
in the hardware.

If we happen to be booting via UEFI, we can fail gracefully so check
for LPAE support in the hardware on CONFIG_ARM_LPAE builds before
entering the kernel proper.
