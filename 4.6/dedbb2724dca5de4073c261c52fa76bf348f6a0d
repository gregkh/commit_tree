clk: s2mps11: remove redundant code

The definition of s2mps11_name is meant to resolve the name of a
given clock. Remove it because the clocks have the same name we
can get it directly from the s2mps11_clks_init structure.

While in the probe function the s2mps11_clks is used only to
iterate through the s2mps11_clks. The naming itself brings
confusion and the readability does not improve much.
