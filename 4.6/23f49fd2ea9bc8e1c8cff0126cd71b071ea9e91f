dmaengine: edma: Remove dynamic TPTC power management feature

The dynamic or on demand pm_runtime does not work correctly on am335x and
am437x due to interference with hwmod.
Fall back using the pm_runtime usage as it was in the old driver stack,
meaning that at probe time call pm_runtime_enable() and
pm_runtime_get_sync() for the TPTCs as well.
