btrfs: fix build warning

We were getting build warning about:
fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:7021:34: warning: ‘used_bg’ may be used
	uninitialized in this function

It is not a valid warning as used_bg is never used uninitilized since
locked is initially false so we can never be in the section where
'used_bg' is used. But gcc is not able to understand that and we can
initialize it while declaring to silence the warning.
