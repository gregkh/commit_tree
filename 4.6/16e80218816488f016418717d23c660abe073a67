usb: dwc2: host: Avoid use of chan->qh after qh freed

When poking around with USB devices with slub_debug enabled, I found
another obvious use after free.  Turns out that in dwc2_hc_n_intr() I
was in a state when the contents of chan->qh was filled with 0x6b,
indicating that chan->qh was freed but chan still had a reference to
it.

Let's make sure that whenever we free qh we also make sure we remove a
reference from its channel.

The bug fixed here doesn't appear to be new--I believe I just got lucky
and happened to see it while stress testing.
