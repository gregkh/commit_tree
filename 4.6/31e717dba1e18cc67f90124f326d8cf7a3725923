[media] Revert "[media] tvp5150: document input connectors DT bindings"

This reverts commit 82c2ffeb217a ("[media] tvp5150: document input
connectors DT bindings") since the DT binding is too device driver
specific and should instead be more generic and use the bindings
in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/connector/ and linked
to the tvp5150 using the OF graph port and endpoints.

There are still ongoing discussions about how the input connectors
will be supported by the Media Controller framework so until that
is settled, it is better to revert the connectors portion of the
bindings to avoid known to be broken bindings docs to hit mainline.
