VSOCK: Detach QP check should filter out non matching QPs.

The check in vmci_transport_peer_detach_cb should only allow a
detach when the qp handle of the transport matches the one in
the detach message.

Testing: Before this change, a detach from a peer on a different
socket would cause an active stream socket to register a detach.
