cpufreq: governor: No need to manage state machine now

The cpufreq core now guarantees that policy->rwsem won't be dropped
while running the ->governor callback for the CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_EXIT
event and will be held acquired until the complete sequence of governor
state changes has finished.

This allows governor state machine checks to be dropped from multiple
functions in cpufreq_governor.c.

This also means that policy_dbs->policy can be initialized upfront, so
the entire initialization of struct policy_dbs can be carried out in
one place.
