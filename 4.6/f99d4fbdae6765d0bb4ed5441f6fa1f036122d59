nfsd: add SCSI layout support

This is a simple extension to the block layout driver to use SCSI
persistent reservations for access control and fencing, as well as
SCSI VPD pages for device identification.

For this we need to pass the nfs4_client to the proc_getdeviceinfo method
to generate the reservation key, and add a new fence_client method
to allow for fence actions in the layout driver.
