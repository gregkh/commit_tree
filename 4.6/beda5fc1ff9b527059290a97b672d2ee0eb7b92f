PM / Domains: Fix removal of a subdomain

Commit 30e7a65b3fdb (PM / Domains: Ensure subdomain is not in use
before removing) added a test to ensure that a subdomain is not a
master to another subdomain or if any devices are using the subdomain
before removing. This change incorrectly used the "slave_links" list to
determine if the subdomain is a master to another subdomain, where it
should have been using the "master_links" list instead. The
"slave_links" list will never be empty for a subdomain and so a
subdomain can never be removed. Fix this by testing if the
"master_links" list is empty instead.
