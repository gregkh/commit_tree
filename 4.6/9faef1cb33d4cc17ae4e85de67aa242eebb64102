tty: serial: 8250: Correct conversion specifiers

This patch fixes compiler warnings about wrong conversion specifiers used
in a debug output in 8250_pnp.c. The precise warning is:

drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pnp.c: In function ‘serial_pnp_probe’:
include/linux/dynamic_debug.h:64:16: warning: format ‘%x’ expects argument
of [...]

drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pnp.c:467:2: note: in expansion of macro
‘dev_dbg’
  dev_dbg(&dev->dev,
  ^
include/linux/dynamic_debug.h:64:16: warning: format ‘%lx’ expects argument
of [...]

drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pnp.c:467:2: note: in expansion of macro
‘dev_dbg’
  dev_dbg(&dev->dev,
  ^

Those warnings never got triggered, because the command was nested
in an #ifdef, which is removed by a patch of this series.
