xfs: don't overflow quota ID when initializing dqblk

Quota IDs are unsigned, and so we can pass in values up
to 2^32-1.  But if we try to initialize a block containing
values over MAX_INT, curid will overflow and assert.

curid holds a quota ID, so give it the proper
xfs_dqid_t type (and remove the now-impossible ASSERT).
