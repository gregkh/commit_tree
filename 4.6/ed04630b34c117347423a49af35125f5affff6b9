firmware: simplify dev_*() print messages for generic helpers

Simplify a few of the *generic* shared dev_warn() and dev_dbg()
print messages for three reasons:

0) Historically firmware_class code was added to help
   get device driver firmware binaries but these days
   request_firmware*() helpers are being repurposed for
   general *system data* needed by the kernel.

1) This will also help generalize shared code as much as possible
   later in the future in consideration for a new extensible firmware
   API which will enable to separate usermode helper code out as much
   as possible.

2) Kees Cook pointed out the the prints already have the device
   associated as dev_*() helpers are used, that should help identify
   the user and case in which the helpers are used. That should provide
   enough context and simplifies the messages further.

v4: generalize debug/warn messages even further as suggested by
    Kees Cook.
