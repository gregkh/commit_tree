mm: workingset: per-cgroup cache thrash detection

Cache thrash detection (see a528910e12ec "mm: thrash detection-based
file cache sizing" for details) currently only works on the system
level, not inside cgroups.  Worse, as the refaults are compared to the
global number of active cache, cgroups might wrongfully get all their
refaults activated when their pages are hotter than those of others.

Move the refault machinery from the zone to the lruvec, and then tag
eviction entries with the memcg ID.  This makes the thrash detection
work correctly inside cgroups.
