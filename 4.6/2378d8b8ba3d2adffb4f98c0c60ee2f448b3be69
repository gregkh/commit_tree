cgroup: re-hash init_css_set after subsystems are initialized

css_sets are hashed by their subsys[] contents and in cgroup_init()
init_css_set is hashed early, before subsystem inits, when all entries
in its subsys[] are NULL, so that cgroup_dfl_root initialization can
find and link to it.  As subsystems are initialized,
init_css_set.subsys[] is filled up but the hashing is never updated
making init_css_set hashed in the wrong place.  While incorrect, this
doesn't cause a critical failure as css_set management code would
create an identical css_set dynamically.

Fix it by rehashing init_css_set after subsystems are initialized.
While at it, drop unnecessary @key local variable.
