wil6210: handle multiple connect/disconnect events

In the current solution wil6210 configures the vring in a worker
and holds only one pending CID. This implementation may lead to
race conditions between connect and disconnect events of multiple
stations or fast connect/disconnect events of the same station.

In order to allow the removal of the connect worker and handling of
WMI_VRING_CFG_DONE_EVENTID in the connect event, the WMI replies
that provide the reply in a given buffer needs to be handled
immediately in the WMI event interrupt thread.
To prevent deadlocks, WMI replies that requires additional
handling are still handled via the events list.
