ALSA: dice: ensure phase lock before starting streaming

In former commits, probing process has no need to set sampling transfer
frequency. Although it's OK to drop a function to change the frequency
from this module, some models require it before streaming. This seems to
be due to phase lock of clock source.

This commit moves the function from transaction layer to stream layer, and
rename it according to the purpose.
