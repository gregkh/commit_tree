of/unittest: fix infinite loop in of_unittest_destroy_tracked_overlays()

of_overlay_destroy() can return `-ENODEV' error code once it
failed to find the requested overlay in `ov_idr'. However,
of_unittest_destroy_tracked_overlays() does not handle this
error code correctly and continues to call of_overlay_destroy()
on the 'missing' overlay over and over again. This results in
a printk flood

which is not really good due to printk design, and can lead to soft
lockups, hard lockups, etc. (depending on the context console_unlock()
is being called from). The problem has bee observed in real life
and reported by Ying Huang.

This patch does not address the root cause of missing overlay in
`ov_idr', it fixes the endless loop only.
