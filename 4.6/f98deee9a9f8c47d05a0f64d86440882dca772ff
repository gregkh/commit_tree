arm64: move brk immediate argument definitions to separate header

Instead of reversing the header dependency between asm/bug.h and
asm/debug-monitors.h, split off the brk instruction immediate value
defines into a new header asm/brk-imm.h, and include it from both.

This solves the circular dependency issue that prevents BUG() from
being used in some header files, and keeps the definitions together.
