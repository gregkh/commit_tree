block: Add blk_set_runtime_active()

If block device is left runtime suspended during system suspend, resume
hook of the driver typically corrects runtime PM status of the device back
to "active" after it is resumed. However, this is not enough as queue's
runtime PM status is still "suspended". As long as it is in this state
blk_pm_peek_request() returns NULL and thus prevents new requests to be
processed.

Add new function blk_set_runtime_active() that can be used to force the
queue status back to "active" as needed.
