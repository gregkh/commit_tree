mtd: nand: remove EXPORT_SYMBOL of nand_scan_bbt()

Since commit 17799359e7b3fa6ef4f2bf926cd6821cf7903ecf ("mtd: nand_bbt:
make nand_scan_bbt() static"), the nand_scan_bbt() function is marked
as static but is still exported using EXPORT_SYMBOL(), which doesn't
make much sense.

This commit gets rid of the useless EXPORT_SYMBOL.
