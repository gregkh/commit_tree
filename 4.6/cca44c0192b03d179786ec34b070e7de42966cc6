cxl: Define process problem state area at attach time only

CXL kernel API was defining the process problem state area during
context initialization, making it possible to map the problem state
area before attaching the context. This won't work on a powerVM
guest. So force the logical behavior, like in userspace: attach first,
then map the problem state area.
Remove calls to cxl_assign_psn_space during init. The function is
already called on the attach paths.
