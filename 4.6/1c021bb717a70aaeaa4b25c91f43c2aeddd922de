net: fec: only clear a queue's work bit if the queue was emptied

In the receive path a queue's work bit was cleared unconditionally even
if fec_enet_rx_queue only read out a part of the available packets from
the hardware. This resulted in not reading any packets in the next napi
turn and so packets were delayed or lost.

The obvious fix is to only clear a queue's bit when the queue was
emptied.
