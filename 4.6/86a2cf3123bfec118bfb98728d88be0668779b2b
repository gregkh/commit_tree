perf stat: Making several helper functions static

There's no need for the following functions to be global:

  perf_evsel__reset_stat_priv
  perf_evsel__alloc_stat_priv
  perf_evsel__free_stat_priv
  perf_evsel__alloc_prev_raw_counts
  perf_evsel__free_prev_raw_counts
  perf_evsel__alloc_stats

They all ended up in util/stat.c, and they no longer need to be called
from outside this object.
