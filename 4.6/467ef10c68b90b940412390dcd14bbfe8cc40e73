perf hists browser: Fix percentage update on key press

Currently 'perf top --tui' decrements percentage of all entries on any
key press.  This is because it adds total period as new samples are
added to hists.  As perf-top does it currently but added samples are not
passed to the display thread, the percentages are decresing
continuously.

So separate total period stat into a different variable so that it
cannot affect the output total period.  This new total period stats are
used only for calcualating callchain percent limit.
