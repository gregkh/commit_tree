iwlwifi: mvm: add duplicate packet detection per rx queue

Next hardware will direct TCP/UDP streams to different cores.
Packets belonging to the same stream will be directed to the same
core.
The result is that duplicates will be always directed to the same
rx queue were the first packet was received.
This enabled parallelizing the duplicate packet detection across
the different cores, without sharing data between the rx queues.
