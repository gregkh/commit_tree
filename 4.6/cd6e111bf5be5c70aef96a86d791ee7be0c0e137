kcm: Add statistics and proc interfaces

This patch adds various counters for KCM. These include counters for
messages and bytes received or sent, as well as counters for number of
attached/unattached TCP sockets and other error or edge events.

The statistics are exposed via a proc interface. /proc/net/kcm provides
statistics per KCM socket and per psock (attached TCP sockets).
/proc/net/kcm_stats provides aggregate statistics.
