cxl: IRQ allocation for guests

The PSL interrupt cannot be multiplexed in a guest, as it is not
supported by the hypervisor. So an interrupt will be allocated
for it for each context. It will still be the first interrupt found in
the first interrupt range, but is treated almost like any other AFU
interrupt when creating/deleting the context. Only the handler is
different. Rework the code so that the range 0 is treated like the
other ranges.
