staging: rtl8712: Remove the unnecessary parantheses

The unnecessary parantheses on the right side of assignments were removed,
as in most cases (expect for ==, >=, <=, !=), they are futile.

This was done using Coccinelle, the semantic patch being:

@@
expression E1,E2,E3;
binary operator bin_op = {==,>=,<=,!=};
@@

E1 =
(
  (
   E2 bin_op E3
  )
|
-(
E2
-)
)
;
