udp: Use uh->len instead of skb->len to compute checksum in segmentation

The segmentation code was having to do a bunch of work to pull the
skb->len and strip the udp header offset before the value could be used to
adjust the checksum.  Instead of doing all this work we can just use the
value that goes into uh->len since that is the correct value with the
correct byte order that we need anyway.  By using this value we can save
ourselves a bunch of pain as there is no need to do multiple byte swaps.
