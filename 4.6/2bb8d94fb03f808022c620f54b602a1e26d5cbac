cpufreq: governor: Use common mutex for dbs_data protection

Every governor relying on the common code in cpufreq_governor.c
has to provide its own mutex in struct common_dbs_data.  However,
there actually is no need to have a separate mutex per governor
for this purpose, they may be using the same global mutex just
fine.  Accordingly, introduce a single common mutex for that and
drop the mutex field from struct common_dbs_data.

That at least will ensure that the mutex is always present and
initialized regardless of what the particular governors do.

Another benefit is that the common code does not need a pointer to
a governor-related structure to get to the mutex which sometimes
helps.

Finally, it makes the code generally easier to follow.
