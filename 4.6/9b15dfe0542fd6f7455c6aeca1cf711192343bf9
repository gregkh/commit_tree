[media] media: s3c-camif: fix deadlock on driver probe()

Commit 0c426c472b5585ed6e59160359c979506d45ae49 ("[media] media: Always
keep a graph walk large enough around") changed
media_device_register_entity() function to take mdev->graph_mutex. This
causes deadlock in driver probe, which calls (indirectly) this function
with ->graph_mutex taken. This patch removes taking ->graph_mutex in
driver probe to avoid deadlock. Other drivers don't take ->graph_mutex
for entity registration, so this change should be safe.
