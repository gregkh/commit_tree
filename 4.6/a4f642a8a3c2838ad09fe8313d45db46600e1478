tty: nozomi: avoid a harmless gcc warning

The nozomi wireless data driver has its own helper function to
transfer data from a FIFO, doing an extra byte swap on big-endian
architectures, presumably to bring the data back into byte-serial
order after readw() or readl() perform their implicit byteswap.

This helper function is used in the receive_data() function to
first read the length into a 32-bit variable, which causes
a compile-time warning:

drivers/tty/nozomi.c: In function 'receive_data':
drivers/tty/nozomi.c:857:9: warning: 'size' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

The problem is that gcc is unsure whether the data was actually
read or not. We know that it is at this point, so we can replace
it with a single readl() to shut up that warning.

I am leaving the byteswap in there, to preserve the existing
behavior, even though this seems fishy: Reading the length of
the data into a cpu-endian variable should normally not use
a second byteswap on big-endian systems, unless the hardware
is aware of the CPU endianess.

There appears to be a lot more confusion about endianess in this
driver, so it probably has not worked on big-endian systems in
a long time, if ever, and I have no way to test it. It's well
possible that this driver has not been used by anyone in a while,
the last patch that looks like it was tested on the hardware is
from 2008.
