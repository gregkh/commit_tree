openvswitch: use flow protocol when recalculating ipv6 checksums

When using masked actions the ipv6_proto field of an action
to set IPv6 fields may be zero rather than the prevailing protocol
which will result in skipping checksum recalculation.

This patch resolves the problem by relying on the protocol
in the flow key rather than that in the set field action.
