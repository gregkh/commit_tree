xhci: Add SuperSpeedPlus high bandwidth isoc support to xhci endpoints

SuperSpeedPlus doubled the number of transactions per service interval
the isoc endpoints supports.

To support this, xhci 1.1 added Large ESIT Capability (LEC), which
takes into use new bits in the endpoint context to fit the parameters.

If xhci supports LEC, and the device has a SuperSpeedPlus Isoc companion
descriptor then take into use the high bits of max esit payload, and
skip calculating the Mult field as it wouldn't fit. LEC capable
host will calculate the Mult based on other paramenters.
