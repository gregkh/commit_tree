usb: f_fs: fix memory leak when ep changes during transfer

In the ffs_epfile_io function, data buffer is allocated for non-halt
requests.  Later, after grabing a mutex, the function checks that
epfile->ep is still ep and if it’s not, it set ret to -ESHUTDOWN and
follow a path including spin_unlock_irq (just after ‘ret = -ESHUTDOWN’),
mutex_unlock (after if-else-if-else chain) and returns ret.  Noticeably,
this does not include freeing of the data buffer.

Fix by introducing a goto which moves control flow to the the end of the
function where spin_unlock_irq, mutex_unlock and kfree are all called.
