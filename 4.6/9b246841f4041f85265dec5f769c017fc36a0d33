Make DST_CACHE a silent config option

commit 911362c70d ("net: add dst_cache support") added a new
kconfig option that gets selected by other networking options.
It seems the intent wasn't to offer this as a user-selectable
option given the lack of help text, so this patch converts it
to a silent option.
