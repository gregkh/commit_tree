KVM: PPC: Rework H_PUT_TCE/H_GET_TCE handlers

This reworks the existing H_PUT_TCE/H_GET_TCE handlers to have following
patches applied nicer.

This moves the ioba boundaries check to a helper and adds a check for
least bits which have to be zeros.

The patch is pretty mechanical (only check for least ioba bits is added)
so no change in behaviour is expected.
