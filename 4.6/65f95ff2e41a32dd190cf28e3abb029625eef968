documentation: Clarify compiler store-fusion example

The compiler store-fusion example in memory-barriers.txt uses a C
comment to represent arbitrary code that does not update a given
variable.  Unfortunately, someone could reasonably interpret the
comment as instead referring to the following line of code.  This
commit therefore replaces the comment with a string that more
clearly represents the arbitrary code.
