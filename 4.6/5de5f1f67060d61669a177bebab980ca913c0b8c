ibmvscsi: Correct values for several viosrp_crq_format enums

The enum values for VIOSRP_LINUX_FORMAT and VIOSRP_INLINE_FORMAT are off
by one. They are currently defined as 0x06 and 0x07 respetively.  These
values are defined in PAPR correctly as 0x05 and 0x06. This
inconsistency has gone unnoticed as neither enum is currently used.  The
possible future support of PING messages between the VIOS and client
adapter relies on VIOSRP_INLINE_FORMAT crq messages.  Corrected these
enum values to match PAPR definitions.
