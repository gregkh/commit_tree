[media] soc_camera/mx3_camera.c: move to staging in preparation, for removal

This driver is deprecated: it should become a stand-alone driver
instead of using the soc-camera framework.

Unless someone is willing to take this on (unlikely with such
ancient hardware) it is going to be removed from the kernel
soon.
