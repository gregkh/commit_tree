drm/i915: GEM operations need to be done under the big lock

VMA creation and GEM list management need the big lock.

v2:

Mutex unlock ended on the wrong path somehow. (0-day, Julia Lawall)

Not to mention drm_gem_object_unreference was there in existing
code with no mutex held.

v3:

Some callers of i915_gem_object_create_stolen_for_preallocated
already hold the lock so move the mutex into the other caller
as well.

v4:

Changed to lockdep_assert_held. (Chris Wilson)
