ARM: 8535/1: mm: DEBUG_RODATA makes no sense with XIP_KERNEL

When CONFIG_DEBUG_ALIGN_RODATA is set, we get a link error:

arch/arm/mm/built-in.o:(.data+0x4bc): undefined reference to `__start_rodata_section_aligned'

However, this combination is useless, as XIP_KERNEL implies that all the
RODATA is already marked readonly, so both CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA and
CONFIG_DEBUG_ALIGN_RODATA (which depends on the other) are not
needed with XIP_KERNEL, and this patches enforces that using a Kconfig
dependency.
