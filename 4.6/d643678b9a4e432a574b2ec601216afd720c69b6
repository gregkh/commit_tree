ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix for unloading module only when it is loaded

Module needs to be unloaded only when it is loaded successfully.
To fix this, first correct the module state sequence and set module
state to LOADED if module is loaded successfully.
When unloading the module check if module state is not in UNINIT,
then unload it.
