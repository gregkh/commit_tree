x86/topology: Fix logical package mapping

That first branch testing pkg against __max_logical_packages is wrong,
because if the first pkg id is larger, then the find_first_zero will
find us logical package id 0. However, if the second pkg id is indeed
0, we'll again claim it without testing if it was already taken.

Also, it fails to print the mapping.
