android: binder: Sanity check at binder ioctl

Sanity check at binder ioctl function,
Only allow the shared mm_struct to use the same binder-object
to do binder operate.

And add proc->vma_vm_mm = current->mm at the open function.
The libbinder do ioctl before mmap called.

V2: Fix compile error for error commit
V3: Change the condition to proc->vma_vm_mm
