mm: memcontrol: zap memcg_kmem_online helper

As kmem accounting is now either enabled for all cgroups or disabled
system-wide, there's no point in having memcg_kmem_online() helper -
instead one can use memcg_kmem_enabled() and mem_cgroup_online(), as
shrink_slab() now does.

There are only two places left where this helper is used -
__memcg_kmem_charge() and memcg_create_kmem_cache().  The former can
only be called if memcg_kmem_enabled() returned true.  Since the cgroup
it operates on is online, mem_cgroup_is_root() check will be enough.

memcg_create_kmem_cache() can't use mem_cgroup_online() helper instead
of memcg_kmem_online(), because it relies on the fact that in
memcg_offline_kmem() memcg->kmem_state is changed before
memcg_deactivate_kmem_caches() is called, but there we can just
open-code the check.
