intel_pstate: Do not skip samples partially

If the current value of MPERF or the current value of TSC is the
same as the previous one, respectively, intel_pstate_sample() bails
out early and skips the sample.

However, intel_pstate_adjust_busy_pstate() is still called in that
case which is not correct, so modify intel_pstate_sample() to
return a bool value indicating whether or not the sample has been
taken and use it to decide whether or not to call
intel_pstate_adjust_busy_pstate().

While at it, remove redundant parentheses from the MPERF/TSC
check in intel_pstate_sample().
