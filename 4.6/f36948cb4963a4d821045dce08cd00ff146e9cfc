ibmvscsi: Add endian conversions to sysfs attribute show functions

The values returned by the show functions for the host os_type,
mad_version, and partition_number attributes get their values directly
from the madapter_info struct whose associated fields are __be32
typed. Added endian conversion to ensure these values are sane on LE
platforms.
