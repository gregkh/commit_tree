i40e: fix write-back-on-itr to work with legacy itr

We were not doing write-back on interrupt throttle for Legacy case in X722.
This patch fixes that, so we do WB_ON_ITR for Legacy as well. Plus the issue
that we should still be setting NO_ITR if we are touching the DYN_CTLN register
since we do not want to change ITR setting here.
