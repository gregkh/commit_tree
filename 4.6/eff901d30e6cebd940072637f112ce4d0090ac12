IB/mlx5: Implement callbacks for manipulating VFs

Implement the IB defined callbacks used to manipulate the policy for the
link state, set GUIDs or get statistics information. This functionality
is added into a new file that will be used to add any SRIOV related
functionality to the mlx5 IB layer.

The following callbacks have been added:

mlx5_ib_get_vf_config
mlx5_ib_set_vf_link_state
mlx5_ib_get_vf_stats
mlx5_ib_set_vf_guid

In addition, publish whether this device is based on a virtual function.

In mlx5 supported devices, virtual functions are implemented as vHCAs.
vHCAs have their own QP number space so it is possible that two vHCAs
will use a QP with the same number at the same time.
