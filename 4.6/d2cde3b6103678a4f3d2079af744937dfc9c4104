ARM: dts: gose: enable sound DMA support via SRC in device tree

Enable DMA transfer to/from SRC in r8a7793/gose device tree.

     DMA      DMApp
[MEM] -> [SRC] -> [SSIU] -> [SSI]

     DMA      DMApp
[MEM] <- [SRC] <- [SSIU] <- [SSI]

Current sound driver is supporting
SSI/SRC random connection.
So, this patch is tring
SSI0 -> SRC2
SSI1 <- SRC3

Based on similar work for the r8a7791/koeslch by Kuninori Morimoto.
