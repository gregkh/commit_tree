drm/nouveau/fifo/gk104: kick channel upon removal

A channel may still be processed by the PBDMA even after removal, unless
it is properly kicked. Some chips are more sensible to this than others,
with GM20B triggering the issue very easily (the PBDMA will try to fetch
methods from the previously-removed channel after a new one is added).

Make sure this cannot happen by kicking the channel right after it is
disabled, and before the new runlist is submitted.
