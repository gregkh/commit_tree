KVM, pkeys: save/restore PKRU when guest/host switches

Currently XSAVE state of host is not restored after VM-exit and PKRU
is managed by XSAVE so the PKRU from guest is still controlling the
memory access even if the CPU is running the code of host. This is
not safe as KVM needs to access the memory of userspace (e,g QEMU) to
do some emulation.

So we save/restore PKRU when guest/host switches.
