NFC: Close a race condition in llcp_sock_getname()

llcp_sock_getname() checks llcp_sock->dev to make sure
llcp_sock is already connected or bound, however, we could
be in the middle of llcp_sock_bind() where llcp_sock->dev
is bound and llcp_sock->service_name_len is set,
but llcp_sock->service_name is not, in this case we would
lead to copy some bytes from a NULL pointer.

Just lock the sock since this is not a hot path anyway.
