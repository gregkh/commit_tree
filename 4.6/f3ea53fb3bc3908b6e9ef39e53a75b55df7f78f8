svcrdma: Use correct XID in error replies

When constructing an error reply, svc_rdma_xdr_encode_error()
needs to view the client's request message so it can get the
failing request's XID.

svc_rdma_xdr_decode_req() is supposed to return a pointer to the
client's request header. But if it fails to decode the client's
message (and thus an error reply is needed) it does not return the
pointer. The server then sends a bogus XID in the error reply.

Instead, unconditionally generate the pointer to the client's header
in svc_rdma_recvfrom(), and pass that pointer to both functions.
