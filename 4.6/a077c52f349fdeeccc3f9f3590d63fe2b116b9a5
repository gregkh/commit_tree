arm-cci: Refactor CCI PMU enable/disable methods

This patch refactors the CCI PMU driver code a little bit to
make it easier share the code for enabling/disabling the CCI
PMU. This will be used by the hooks to work around the special cases
where writing to a counter is not always that easy(e.g, CCI-500)

No functional changes.
