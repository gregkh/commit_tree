dm: fix sparse "unexpected unlock" warnings in ioctl code

Rename dm_get_live_table_for_ioctl to dm_grab_bdev_for_ioctl and have it
do the dm_{get,put}_live_table() rather than split those operations.

The dm_grab_bdev_for_ioctl() callers only care about the block_device
associated with a singleton DM device so there isn't any need to retain
a reference to the live DM table.  It is sufficient to:
1) dm_get_live_table()
2) bdgrab() the bdev associated with the singleton table's target
3) dm_put_live_table()
4) bdput() the bdev
