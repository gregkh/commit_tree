staging: lustre: remove uses of IS_ERR_VALUE()

Remove most uses of IS_ERR_VALUE(). This macro was often given an int
argument coming from PTR_ERR(). This invokes implementation defined
behavior since the long value gotten by applying PTR_ERR() to a kernel
pointer will usually not be representable as an int. Moreover it may
be just plain wrong to do this since the expressions IS_ERR(p) and
IS_ERR_VALUE((int) PTR_ERR(p)) are not equivalent for a general
pointer p.
