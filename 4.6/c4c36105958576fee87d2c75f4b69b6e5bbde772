KEYS: Reserve an extra certificate symbol for inserting without recompiling

Place a system_extra_cert buffer of configurable size, right after the
system_certificate_list, so that inserted keys can be readily processed by
the existing mechanism. Added script takes a key file and a kernel image
and inserts its contents to the reserved area. The
system_certificate_list_size is also adjusted accordingly.

Call the script as:

    scripts/insert-sys-cert -b <vmlinux> -c <certfile>

If vmlinux has no symbol table, supply System.map file with -s flag.
Subsequent runs replace the previously inserted key, instead of appending
the new one.
