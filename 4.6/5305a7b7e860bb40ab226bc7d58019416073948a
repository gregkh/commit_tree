pinctrl: at91-pio4: fix pull-up/down logic

The default configuration of a pin is often with a value in the
pull-up/down field at chip reset. So, even if the internal logic of the
controller prevents writing a configuration with pull-up and pull-down at
the same time, we must ensure explicitly this condition before writing the
register.

This was leading to a pull-down condition not taken into account for
instance.
