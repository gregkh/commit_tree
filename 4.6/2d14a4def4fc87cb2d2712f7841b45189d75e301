tcp: make congestion control more robust against reordering

This change enables congestion control to update cwnd based on
not only packet cumulatively acked but also packets delivered
out-of-order. This makes congestion control robust against packet
reordering because it may raise cwnd as long as packets are being
delivered once reordering has been detected (i.e., it only cares
the amount of packets delivered, not the ordering among them).
