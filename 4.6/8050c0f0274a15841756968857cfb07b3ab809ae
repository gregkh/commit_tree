bpf: allow bpf_csum_diff to feed bpf_l3_csum_replace as well

Commit 7d672345ed29 ("bpf: add generic bpf_csum_diff helper") added a
generic checksum diff helper that can feed bpf_l4_csum_replace() with
a target __wsum diff that is to be applied to the L4 checksum. This
facility is very flexible, can be cascaded, allows for adding, removing,
or diffing data, or for calculating the pseudo header checksum from
scratch, but it can also be reused for working with the IPv4 header
checksum.

Thus, analogous to bpf_l4_csum_replace(), add a case for header field
value of 0 to change the checksum at a given offset through a new helper
csum_replace_by_diff(). Also, in addition to that, this provides an
easy to use interface for feeding precalculated diffs f.e. coming from
a map. It nicely complements bpf_l3_csum_replace() that currently allows
only for csum updates of 2 and 4 byte diffs.
