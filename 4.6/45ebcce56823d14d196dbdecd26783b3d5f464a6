bridge: mdb: Marking port-group as offloaded

There is a race-condition when updating the mdb offload flag without using
the mulicast_lock. This reverts commit 9e8430f8d60d98 ("bridge: mdb:
Passing the port-group pointer to br_mdb module").

This patch marks offloaded MDB entry as "offload" by changing the port-
group flags and marks it as MDB_PG_FLAGS_OFFLOAD.

When switchdev PORT_MDB succeeded and adds a multicast group, a completion
callback is been invoked "br_mdb_complete". The completion function
locks the multicast_lock and finds the right net_bridge_port_group and
marks it as offloaded.
