KVM: MMU: cleanup __kvm_sync_page and its callers

Calling kvm_unlink_unsync_page in the middle of __kvm_sync_page makes
things unnecessarily tricky.  If kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page is called,
it will call kvm_unlink_unsync_page too.  So kvm_unlink_unsync_page can
be called just as well at the beginning or the end of __kvm_sync_page...
which means that we might do it in kvm_sync_page too and remove the
parameter.

kvm_sync_page ends up being the same code that kvm_sync_pages used
to have before the previous patch.
