staging: dgnc: cleanup properly

dgnc_cleanup_module() was called when the module unloaded to do a total
cleanup and it was also called if pci_register_driver() fails. But
dgnc_cleanup_module() will try dgnc_remove_driver_sysfiles() but the
sysfiles will be created only if pci_register_driver() succeeds.
So if pci_register_driver() fails and we try dgnc_cleanup_module() then we
were getting:

[  942.001479] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000018
[  942.001482] IP: [<c122c7a8>] sysfs_remove_file_ns+0x8/0x20

with part of the call trace as:

[  942.001544] Call Trace:

Lets have a separate cleanup function which will execute
dgnc_remove_driver_sysfiles() depending on the argument passed to it.
