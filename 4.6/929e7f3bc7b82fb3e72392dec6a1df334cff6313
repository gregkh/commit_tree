clk: Make of_clk_get_parent_count() return unsigned ints

Russell King recently pointed out a bug in the clk-gpio code
where it fails to register the clk if of_clk_get_parent_count()
returns an error because the "clocks" property isn't present in
the DT node. If we're trying to count parents from DT we'd like
to know the count, not if there is a "clocks" property or not.
Furthermore, some drivers are assigning the return value to their
clk_init_data::num_parents member which is unsigned, leading to
potentially large numbers of parents when the property isn't
present.

Let's change the API to return an unsigned int instead of an int.
All the callers just want to know the count anyway, and this
avoids the bug that was in the clk-gpio driver.
