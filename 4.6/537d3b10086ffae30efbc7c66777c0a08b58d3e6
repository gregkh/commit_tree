drm/i915: Adjust size of PIPE_CONTROL used for gen8 render seqno write

We started to use PIPE_CONTROL to write render ring seqno in order to
combat seqno write vs interrupt generation problems. This was introduced
by commit 7c17d377374d ("drm/i915: Use ordered seqno write interrupt
generation on gen8+ execlists").

On gen8+ size of PIPE_CONTROL with Post Sync Operation should be
6 dwords. When we're using older 5-dword variant it's possible to
observe inconsistent values written by PIPE_CONTROL with Post
Sync Operation from user batches, resulting in rendering corruptions.

v2: Fix BAT failures
v3: Comments on alignment and thrashing high dword of seqno (Chris)
v4: Updated commit msg (Mika)
