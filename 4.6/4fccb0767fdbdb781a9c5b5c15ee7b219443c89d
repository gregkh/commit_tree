usb: renesas_usbhs: fix to avoid using a disabled ep in usbhsg_queue_done()

This patch fixes an issue that usbhsg_queue_done() may cause kernel
panic when dma callback is running and usb_ep_disable() is called
by interrupt handler. (Especially, we can reproduce this issue using
g_audio with usb-dmac driver.)

For example of a flow:
 usbhsf_dma_complete (on tasklet)
  --> usbhsf_pkt_handler (on tasklet)
   --> usbhsg_queue_done (on tasklet)
    *** interrupt happened and usb_ep_disable() is called ***
    --> usbhsg_queue_pop (on tasklet)
     Then, oops happened.
