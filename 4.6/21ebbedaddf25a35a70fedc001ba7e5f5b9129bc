KVM: page track: add the framework of guest page tracking

The array, gfn_track[mode][gfn], is introduced in memory slot for every
guest page, this is the tracking count for the gust page on different
modes. If the page is tracked then the count is increased, the page is
not tracked after the count reaches zero

We use 'unsigned short' as the tracking count which should be enough as
shadow page table only can use 2^14 (2^3 for level, 2^1 for cr4_pae, 2^2
for quadrant, 2^3 for access, 2^1 for nxe, 2^1 for cr0_wp, 2^1 for
smep_andnot_wp, 2^1 for smap_andnot_wp, and 2^1 for smm) at most, there
is enough room for other trackers

Two callbacks, kvm_page_track_create_memslot() and
kvm_page_track_free_memslot() are implemented in this patch, they are
internally used to initialize and reclaim the memory of the array

Currently, only write track mode is supported
