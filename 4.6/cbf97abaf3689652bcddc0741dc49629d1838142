tools/power turbostat: Intel Xeon x200: fix turbo-ratio decoding

Following changes have been made:
- changed MSR_NHM_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT to MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT in debug print
  for consistency with Developer Manual
- updated definition of bitfields in MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT and appropriate
  parsing code
- added x200 to list of architectures that do not support Nahlem compatible
  definition of MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT register (x200 has the register but
  bits definition is custom)
- fixed typo in code that parses MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT
  (logical instead of bitwise operator)
- changed MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT parsing algorithm so the print out had the
  same order as implementations for other platforms
