arm/arm64: Add new is_kernel_in_hyp_mode predicate

With ARMv8.1 VHE extension, it will be possible to run the kernel
at EL2 (aka HYP mode). In order for the kernel to easily find out
where it is running, add a new predicate that returns whether or
not the kernel is in HYP mode.

For completeness, the 32bit code also get such a predicate (always
returning false) so that code common to both architecture (timers,
KVM) can use it transparently.
