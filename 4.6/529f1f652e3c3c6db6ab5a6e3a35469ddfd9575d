i40e/i40evf: Add exception handling for Tx checksum

Add exception handling to the Tx checksum path so that we can handle cases
of TSO where the frame is bad, or Tx checksum where we didn't recognize a
protocol

Drop I40E_TX_FLAGS_CSUM as it is unused, move the CHECKSUM_PARTIAL check
into the function itself so that we can decrease indent.
