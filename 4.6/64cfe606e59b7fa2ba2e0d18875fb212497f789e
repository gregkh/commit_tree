Staging: rts5208: rtsx_transport.c: Cleanup comments

This patch fixes all multiline comments to conform to the coding style,
which states that multiline comments should start with "/*" and end
with "*/" on a separate line.

Also cleans up some comments to make them more clear and/or reflect what
the code is doing.
