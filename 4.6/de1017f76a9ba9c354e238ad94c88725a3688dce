i40e: add netdev info to VSI dump

Add a few more bits of netdev data into the debugfs output for dump VSI.
For now, we'll add the features, hw_features, vlan_features, and flags
bitflags and the state. More could be added later if needed.

Also, tweak a couple nearby output lines for output readability.
