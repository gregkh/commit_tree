tools lib traceevent: Do not reassign parg after collapse_tree()

At the end of process_filter(), collapse_tree() was changed to update
the parg parameter, but the reassignment after the call wasn't removed.

What happens is that the "current_op" gets modified and freed and parg
is assigned to the new allocated argument. But after the call to
collapse_tree(), parg is assigned again to the just freed "current_op",
and this causes the tool to crash.

The current_op variable must also be assigned to NULL in case of error,
otherwise it will cause it to be free()ed twice.
