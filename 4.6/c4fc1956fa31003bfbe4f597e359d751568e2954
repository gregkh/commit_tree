EDAC: i7core, sb_edac: Don't return NOTIFY_BAD from mce_decoder callback

Both of these drivers can return NOTIFY_BAD, but this terminates
processing other callbacks that were registered later on the chain.
Since the driver did nothing to log the error it seems wrong to prevent
other interested parties from seeing it. E.g. neither of them had even
bothered to check the type of the error to see if it was a memory error
before the return NOTIFY_BAD.
