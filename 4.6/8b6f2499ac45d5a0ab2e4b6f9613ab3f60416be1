ARM: 8511/1: ARM64: kernel: PSCI: move PSCI idle management code to drivers/firmware

ARM64 PSCI kernel interfaces that initialize idle states and implement
the suspend API to enter them are generic and can be shared with the
ARM architecture.

To achieve that goal, this patch moves ARM64 PSCI idle management
code to drivers/firmware, so that the interface to initialize and
enter idle states can actually be shared by ARM and ARM64 arches
back-ends.

The ARM generic CPUidle implementation also requires the definition of
a cpuidle_ops section entry for the kernel to initialize the CPUidle
operations at boot based on the enable-method (ie ARM64 has the
statically initialized cpu_ops counterparts for that purpose); therefore
this patch also adds the required section entry on CONFIG_ARM for PSCI so
that the kernel can initialize the PSCI CPUidle back-end when PSCI is
the probed enable-method.

On ARM64 this patch provides no functional change.
