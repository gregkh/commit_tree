staging: lustre: Handle nodemask on UMP machines

For UMP and SMP machines the struct cfs_cpt_table are
defined differently. In the case handled by this patch
nodemask is defined as a integer for the UMP case and
as a pointer for the SMP case. This will cause a problem
for ost_setup which reads the nodemask directly. Instead
we create a UMP version of cfs_cpt_nodemask and use that
in ost_setup.

Starting in 3.14 kernels nodemask_t was changed from a
a unsigned long to a linux bitmap so more than 32 cores
could be supported. Using set_bit in cfs_cpt_table_alloc
no longer compiles so this patch backports bits of the
node management function that use a linux bitmap back
end. Cleaned up libcfs bitmap.h to use the libcfs layers
memory allocation function. This was pulling in lustre
related code that was not defined.
