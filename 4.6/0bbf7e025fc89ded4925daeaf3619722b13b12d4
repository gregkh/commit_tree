ALSA: mts64: fix NULL pointer dereference

While registering pardev, the irq_func was also registered. As a
result when we tried to probe for the card, an interrupt was generated
and in the ISR we tried to dereference private_data. But private_data
is still NULL as we have not yet done snd_mts64_create(). Lets probe
for the card after mts64 is created.
