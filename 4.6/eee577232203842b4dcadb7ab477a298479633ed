net: bcmgenet: fix dma api length mismatch

When un-mapping skb->data in __bcmgenet_tx_reclaim(),
we must use the length that was used in original dma_map_single(),
instead of skb->len that might be bigger (includes the frags)

We simply can store skb_len into tx_cb_ptr->dma_len and use it
at unmap time.
