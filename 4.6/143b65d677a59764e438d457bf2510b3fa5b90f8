gpio: create an API to detect open drain/source on lines

My left hand merges code to privatize the descriptor handling
while my right hand merges drivers that poke around and
disrespect with the same gpiolib internals.

So let's expose the proper APIs for drivers to ask the gpiolib
core if a line is marked as open drain or open source and
get some order around things so this driver compiles again.
