drm/amd/powerplay: add powerplay valid check to avoid null point.

In case CONFIG_DRM_AMD_POWERPLAY is defined and amdgpu.powerplay=0.
some functions in powrplay can also be called by DAL. and the input parameter is *adev.
if just check point not NULL was not enough and will lead to NULL point error.
