cpufreq: intel_pstate: fix inconsistency in setting policy limits

When user sets performance policy using cpufreq interface, it is possible
that because of policy->max limits, the actual performance is still
limited. But the current implementation will silently switch the
policy to powersave and start using powersave limits. If user modifies
any limits using intel_pstate sysfs, this is actually changing powersave
limits.

The current implementation tracks limits under powersave and performance
policy using two different variables. When policy->max is less than
policy->cpuinfo.max_freq, only powersave limit variable is used.

This fix causes the performance limits variable to be used always when
the policy is performance.
