cpufreq: Merge cpufreq_offline_prepare/finish routines

Commit 1aee40ac9c86 (cpufreq: Invoke __cpufreq_remove_dev_finish()
after releasing cpu_hotplug.lock) split the cpufreq's CPU offline
routine in two pieces, one of them to be run with CPU offline/online
locked and the other to be called later.  The reason for that split
was a possible deadlock scenario involving cpufreq sysfs attributes
and CPU offline.

However, the handling of CPU offline in cpufreq has changed since
then.  Policy sysfs attributes are never removed during CPU offline,
so there's no need to worry about accessing them during CPU offline,
because that can't lead to any deadlocks now.  Governor sysfs
attributes are still removed in __cpufreq_governor(_EXIT), but
there is a new kobject type for them now and its show/store
callbacks don't lock CPU offline/online (they don't need to do
that).

This means that the CPU offline code in cpufreq doesn't need to
be split any more, so combine cpufreq_offline_prepare() with
cpufreq_offline_finish().
