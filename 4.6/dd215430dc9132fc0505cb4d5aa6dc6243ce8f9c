NFC: pn544: Drop two useless checks in ACPI probe path

When pn544_hci_i2c_acpi_request_resources() gets called we
already know that the entries in ->acpi_match_table have
matched ACPI ID of the device.
In addition I2C client pointer cannot be NULL in any case
(otherwise I2C core would not call ->probe() for the driver
in the first place).

Drop the two useless checks from the driver.
