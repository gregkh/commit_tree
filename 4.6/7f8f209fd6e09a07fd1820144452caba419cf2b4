dmaengine: add Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA management driver

The Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA device has been designed to support
virtualization technology. The driver has been divided into two to follow
the hardware design.

1. HIDMA Management driver
2. HIDMA Channel driver

Each HIDMA HW consists of multiple channels. These channels share some set
of common parameters. These parameters are initialized by the management
driver during power up. Same management driver is used for monitoring the
execution of the channels. Management driver can change the performance
behavior dynamically such as bandwidth allocation and prioritization.

The management driver is executed in host context and is the main
management entity for all channels provided by the device.
