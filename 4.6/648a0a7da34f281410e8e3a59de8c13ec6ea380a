scsi: sim710: fix build warning

We are getting build warning about:
 "Section mismatch in reference from the variable sim710_eisa_driver to
 the function .init.text:sim710_eisa_probe()
 The variable sim710_eisa_driver references the function __init
 sim710_eisa_probe()"

sim710_eisa_probe() was having __init but that was being referenced from
sim710_eisa_driver.
