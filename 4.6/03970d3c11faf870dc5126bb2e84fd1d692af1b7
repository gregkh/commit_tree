cgroup: use cgroup_apply_enable_control() in cgroup creation path

cgroup_create() manually updates control masks and creates child csses
which cgroup_mkdir() then manually populates.  Both can be simplified
by using cgroup_apply_enable_control() and friends.  The only catch is
that it calls css_populate_dir() with NULL cgroup->kn during
cgroup_create().  This is worked around by making the function noop on
NULL kn.
