irqchip/armada-370-xp: Use shorter names for irq_chip

In order to make the output of /proc/interrupts, use shorter names for
the irq_chip registered by the irq-armada-370-xp driver. Using capital
letters also matches better what is done for the GIC driver, which
uses just "GIC" as the irq_chip->name.
