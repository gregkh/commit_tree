jffs2: Improve post-mount CRC scan efficiency

We need to finish doing the CRC checks before we can allow writes to
happen, and we currently process the inodes in order. This means a call
to jffs2_get_ino_cache() for each possible inode# up to c->highest_ino.

There may be a lot of lookups which fail, if the inode# space is used
sparsely. And the inode# space is *often* used sparsely, if a file
system contains a lot of stuff that was put there in the original
image, followed by lots of creation and deletion of new files.

Instead of processing them numerically with a lookup each time, just
walk the hash buckets instead.
