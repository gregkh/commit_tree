perf hists: Introduce hist_entry__filter()

The hist_entry__filter() function is to filter hist entries using sort
key related info.  This is needed to support hierarchy mode since each
hist entry will be associated with a hpp fmt which has a sort key.  So
each entry should compare to only matching type of filters.

To do that, add the ->se_filter callback field to struct sort_entry.
This callback takes 'type' argument which determines whether it's
matching sort key or not.  It returns -1 for non-matching type, 0 for
filtered entry and 1 for not filtered entries.
