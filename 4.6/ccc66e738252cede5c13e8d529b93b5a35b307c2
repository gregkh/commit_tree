ARM: 8508/2: videobuf2-dc: Let drivers specify DMA attrs

DMA allocations might be subject to certain requirements specific to the
hardware using the buffers, such as availability of kernel mapping (for
contents fix-ups in the driver). The only entity that knows them is the
driver, so it must share this knowledge with vb2-dc.

This patch extends the alloc_ctx initialization interface to let the
driver specify DMA attrs, which are then stored inside the allocation
context and will be used for all allocations with that context.

As a side effect, all dma_*_coherent() calls are turned into
dma_*_attrs() calls, because the attributes need to be carried over
through all DMA operations.
