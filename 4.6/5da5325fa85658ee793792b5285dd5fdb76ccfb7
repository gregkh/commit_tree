coresight: moving PM runtime operations to core framework

Moving PM runtime operations in Coresight devices enable() and
disable() API to the framework core when a path is setup.  That
way the runtime core doesn't have to be involved everytime a
path is enabled.  It also avoids calling runtime PM operations
in IRQ context.
