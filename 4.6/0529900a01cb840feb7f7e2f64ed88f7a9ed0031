crypto: omap-aes - Support crypto engine framework

Integrate with the newly added crypto engine to make the crypto hardware
engine underutilized as each block needs to be processed before the crypto
hardware can start working on the next block.

The requests from dm-crypt will be listed into engine queue and processed
by engine automatically, so remove the 'queue' and 'queue_task' things in
omap aes driver.
