net: vrf: Fix dst reference counting

Vivek reported a kernel exception deleting a VRF with an active
connection through it. The root cause is that the socket has a cached
reference to a dst that is destroyed. Converting the dst_destroy to
dst_release and letting proper reference counting kick in does not
work as the dst has a reference to the device which needs to be released
as well.

I talked to Hannes about this at netdev and he pointed out the ipv4 and
ipv6 dst handling has dst_ifdown for just this scenario. Rather than
continuing with the reinvented dst wheel in VRF just remove it and
leverage the ipv4 and ipv6 versions.

Fixes: 193125dbd8eb2 ("net: Introduce VRF device driver")
Fixes: 35402e3136634 ("net: Add IPv6 support to VRF device")
