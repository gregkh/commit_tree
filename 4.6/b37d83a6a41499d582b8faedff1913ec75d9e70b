usb: Parse the new USB 3.1 SuperSpeedPlus Isoc endpoint companion descriptor

USB 3.1 devices can return a new SuperSpeedPlus isoc endpoint companion
descriptor for a isochronous endpoint that requires more than 48K bytes
per Service Interval.

The new descriptor immediately follows the old USB 3.0 SuperSpeed Endpoint
Companion and will provide a new BytesPerInterval value.

It is parsed and stored in struct usb_host_endpoint with the other endpoint
related descriptors, and should be used by USB3.1 capable hosts to reserve
bus time in the schedule.
