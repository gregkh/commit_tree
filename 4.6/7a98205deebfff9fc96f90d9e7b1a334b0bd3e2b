KVM: MMU: fix permission_fault()

kvm-unit-tests complained about the PFEC is not set properly, e.g,:
test pte.rw pte.d pte.nx pde.p pde.rw pde.pse user fetch: FAIL: error code 15
expected 5
Dump mapping: address: 0x123400000000
------L4: 3e95007
------L3: 3e96007
------L2: 2000083

It's caused by the reason that PFEC returned to guest is copied from the
PFEC triggered by shadow page table

This patch fixes it and makes the logic of updating errcode more clean
