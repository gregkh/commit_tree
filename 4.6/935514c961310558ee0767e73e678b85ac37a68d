regulator: vexpress: rename vexpress regulator implementation

The vexpress regulator implementation is currently just called vexpress.
This is a problem because it clashes with another module with the same
name in hardware monitors.

This patch renames the vexpress regulator implementation to
vexpress-regulator so that there will be no clash in the module namespace.
