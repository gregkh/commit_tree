cpufreq: Introduce cpufreq_start_governor()

Starting a governor in cpufreq always follows the same pattern
involving two calls to cpufreq_governor(), one with the event
argument set to CPUFREQ_GOV_START and one with that argument set to
CPUFREQ_GOV_LIMITS.

Introduce cpufreq_start_governor() that will carry out those two
operations and make all places where governors are started use it.

That slightly modifies the behavior of cpufreq_set_policy() which
now also will go back to the old governor if the second call to
cpufreq_governor() (the one with event equal to CPUFREQ_GOV_LIMITS)
fails, but that really is how it should work in the first place.

Also cpufreq_resume() will now pring an error message if the
CPUFREQ_GOV_LIMITS call to cpufreq_governor() fails, but that
makes it follow cpufreq_add_policy_cpu() and cpufreq_offline()
in that respect.
