rtc: ds1307: Use irq when available for wakeup-source device

With commit 8bc2a40730ec ("rtc: ds1307: add support for the
DT property 'wakeup-source'") we lost the ability for rtc irq
functionality for devices that are actually hooked on a real IRQ
line and have capability to wakeup as well. This is not an expected
behavior. So, instead of just not requesting IRQ, skip the IRQ
requirement only if interrupts are not defined for the device.
