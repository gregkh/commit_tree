drm/i915: Handle PipeC fused off on IVB/HSW/BDW

Some Gen7/8 production parts may have the Display Pipe C fused off.
In this case, the display hardware will prevent the enable bit in
PIPE_CONF register (for Pipe C) from being set to 1.

Fixed by adjusting pipe_count to reflect this.

v2: Rename HSW_PIPE_C_DISABLE to IVB_PIPE_C_DISABLE as it already exists
    on ivybridge (Ville)
v3: Remove unnecessary MMIO read, correct the description (Damien)
v4: Be more specific in description (Patrick)
