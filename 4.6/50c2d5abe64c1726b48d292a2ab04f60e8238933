btrfs: introduce key type for persistent permanent items

The number of distinct key types is not that big that we could waste one
for something new we want to store in the tree.

Similar to the temporary items, we'll introduce a new name for an
existing key value and use the objectid for further extension.  The
victim is the BTRFS_DEV_STATS_KEY (248).

The device stats are an example of a permanent item.
