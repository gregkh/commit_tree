documentation:  Add alternative release-acquire outcome

The memory-barriers.txt discussion of local transitivity and
release-acquire chains leaves out discussion of the outcome of
the read from "u".  This commit therefore adds an outcome showing
that you can get a "1" from this read even if the release-acquire
pairs don't line up.
