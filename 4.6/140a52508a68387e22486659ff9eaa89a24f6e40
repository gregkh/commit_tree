ext4: factor out determining of hole size

ext4_ext_put_gap_in_cache() determines hole size in the extent tree,
then trims this with possible delayed allocated blocks, and inserts the
result into the extent status tree. Factor out determination of the size
of the hole in the extent tree as we will need this information in
ext4_ext_map_blocks() as well.
