arm64: KVM: VHE: Split save/restore of registers shared between guest and host

A handful of system registers are still shared between host and guest,
even while using VHE (tpidr*_el[01] and actlr_el1).

Also, some of the vcpu state (sp_el0, PC and PSTATE) must be
save/restored on entry/exit, as they are used on the host as well.

In order to facilitate the introduction of a VHE-specific sysreg
save/restore, make move the access to these registers to their
own save/restore functions.

No functional change.
