irqchip/gic/realview: Support more RealView DCC variants

In the add-on file for the GIC dealing with the RealView family
we currently only handle the PB11MPCore, let's extend this to
manage the RealView EB ARM11MPCore as well. The Revision B of the
ARM11MPCore core tile is a bit special and needs special handling
as it moves a system control register around at random.
