IB/rdmavt, staging/rdma/hfi1: use qps to dynamically scale timeout value

A busy_jiffies variable is maintained and updated when rc qps are
created and deleted. busy_jiffies is a scaled value of the number
of rc qps in the device. busy_jiffies is incremented every rc qp
scaling interval. busy_jiffies is added to the rc timeout
in add_retry_timer and mod_retry_timer. The rc qp scaling interval
is selected based on extensive performance evaluation of targeted
workloads.
