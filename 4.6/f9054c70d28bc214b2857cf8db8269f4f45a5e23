mm, mempool: only set __GFP_NOMEMALLOC if there are free elements

If an oom killed thread calls mempool_alloc(), it is possible that it'll
loop forever if there are no elements on the freelist since
__GFP_NOMEMALLOC prevents it from accessing needed memory reserves in
oom conditions.

Only set __GFP_NOMEMALLOC if there are elements on the freelist.  If
there are no free elements, allow allocations without the bit set so
that memory reserves can be accessed if needed.

Additionally, using mempool_alloc() with __GFP_NOMEMALLOC is not
supported since the implementation can loop forever without accessing
memory reserves when needed.
