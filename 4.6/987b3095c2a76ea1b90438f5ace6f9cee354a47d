mm: meminit: initialise more memory for inode/dentry hash tables in early boot

Upstream has supported page parallel initialisation for X86 and the boot
time is improved greately.  Some tests have been done for Power.

Here is the result I have done with different memory size.

* 4GB memory:
    boot time is as the following:
    with patch vs without patch: 10.4s vs 24.5s
    boot time is improved 57%
* 200GB memory:
    boot time looks the same with and without patches.
    boot time is about 38s
* 32TB memory:
    boot time looks the same with and without patches
    boot time is about 160s.
    The boot time is much shorter than X86 with 24TB memory.
    From community discussion, it costs about 694s for X86 24T system.

Parallel initialisation improves the performance by deferring memory
initilisation to kswap with N kthreads, it should improve the performance
therotically.

In testing on X86, performance is improved greatly with huge memory.  But
on Power platform, it is improved greatly with less than 100GB memory.
For huge memory, it is not improved greatly.  But it saves the time with
several threads at least, as the following information shows(32TB system
log):

It saves the time about 550*16 ms at least, although it can be ignore to
compare the boot time about 160 seconds.  What's more, the boot time is
much shorter on Power even without patches than x86 for huge memory
machine.

So this patchset is still necessary to be enabled for Power.

This patch (of 2):

This patch is based on Mel Gorman's old patch in the mailing list,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/5/280 which is discussed but it is fixed with
a completion to wait for all memory initialised in page_alloc_init_late().
It is to fix the OOM problem on X86 with 24TB memory which allocates
memory in late initialisation.  But for Power platform with 32TB memory,
it causes a call trace in vfs_caches_init->inode_init() and inode hash
table needs more memory.  So this patch allocates 1GB for 0.25TB/node for
large system as it is mentioned in https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/1/627

This call trace is found on Power with 32TB memory, 1024CPUs, 16nodes.
Currently, it only allocates 2GB*16=32GB for early initialisation.  But
Dentry cache hash table needes 16GB and Inode cache hash table needs 16GB.
So the system have no enough memory for it.  The log from dmesg as the
following:

  Dentry cache hash table entries: 2147483648 (order: 18,17179869184 bytes)
