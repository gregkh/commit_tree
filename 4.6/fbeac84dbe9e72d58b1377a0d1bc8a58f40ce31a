ALSA: dice: old firmware optimization for Dice notification

As long as I tested, Dice-based models produced by TC Electronic with
factory-configured settings transfer no notification within
ensure_phase_lock(). On the other hand, with upgraded firmwares, it
starts to transfer the notification. This seems to be a quirk of earlier
firmwares.

This commit ensures phase lock by reading a register after waiting for
the notification. Even if it's timed-out, ensure_phase_lock() return
success as long as the register has expected clock status.
