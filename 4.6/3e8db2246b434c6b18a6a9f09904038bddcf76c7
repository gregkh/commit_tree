x86/topology: Use total_cpus not nr_cpu_ids for logical packages

nr_cpu_ids can be limited on the command line via nr_cpus=. That can break the
logical package management because it results in a smaller number of packages,
but the cpus to online are occupying the full package space as the hyper
threads are enumerated after the physical cores typically.

total_cpus is the real possible cpu space not limited by nr_cpus command line
and gives us the proper number of packages.
