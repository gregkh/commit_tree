drm/i915/fbc: choose the new FBC CRTC during atomic check

This opens the possibility of implementing nicer schemes to choose the
CRTC, such as checking the amount of stolen memory available, or
choosing the best pipe on platforms that don't die FBC to pipe or
plane A.

This code was written for another refactor that I ended up discarding,
so I don't actually need it, but I figured this patch would be an
improvement on its own so I kept it on the series.
