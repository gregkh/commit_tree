drm/i915: don't deactivate FBC at skylake_disable_primary_plane

FBC is already deactivated at this point.

Besides, nothing should be calling these lower-level function
pointers. A few months ago, the only caller of
dev_priv->fbc.deactivate was intel_pipe_set_base_atomic(), which was
the kgdboc function. But the following commit added it to the SKL
function:
