rapidio/rionet: add mport removal handling

Add handling of a local mport device removal.

RIONET driver registers itself as class interface that supports only
removal notification, 'add_device' callback is not provided because
RIONET network device can be initialized only after enumeration is
completed and the existing method (using remote peer addition) satisfies
this condition.
