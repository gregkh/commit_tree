perf trace: Check and discard not only 'nr' but also '__syscall_nr'

Format fields of a syscall have the first variable '__syscall_nr' or
'nr' that mean the syscall number.  But it isn't relevant here so drop
it.

'nr' among fields of syscall was renamed '__syscall_nr'.  So add
exception handling to drop '__syscall_nr' and modify the comment for
this excpetion handling.
