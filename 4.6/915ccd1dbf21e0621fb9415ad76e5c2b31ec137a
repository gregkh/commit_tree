arm64: KVM: VHE: Introduce unified system register accessors

VHE brings its own bag of new system registers, or rather system
register accessors, as it define new ways to access both guest
and host system registers. For example, from the host:

- The host TCR_EL2 register is accessed using the TCR_EL1 accessor
- The guest TCR_EL1 register is accessed using the TCR_EL12 accessor

Obviously, this is confusing. A way to somehow reduce the complexity
of writing code for both ARMv8 and ARMv8.1 is to use a set of unified
accessors that will generate the right sysreg, depending on the mode
the CPU is running in. For example:

- read_sysreg_el1(tcr) will use TCR_EL1 on ARMv8, and TCR_EL12 on
  ARMv8.1 with VHE.
- read_sysreg_el2(tcr) will use TCR_EL2 on ARMv8, and TCR_EL1 on
  ARMv8.1 with VHE.

We end up with three sets of accessors ({read,write}_sysreg_el[012])
that can be directly used from C code. We take this opportunity to
also add the definition for the new VHE sysregs.
