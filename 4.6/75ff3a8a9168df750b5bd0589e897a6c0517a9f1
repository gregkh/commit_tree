Drivers: hv: vmbus: avoid wait_for_completion() on crash

wait_for_completion() may sleep, it enables interrupts and this
is something we really want to avoid on crashes because interrupt
handlers can cause other crashes. Switch to the recently introduced
vmbus_wait_for_unload() doing busy wait instead.
