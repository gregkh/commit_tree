drm/exynos: use arch independent types in uapi header

User API structs should not use types which size/alignment/padding depends
on architecture. The patch fixes it for all structures except
drm_exynos_g2d_userptr, as g2d related stuff seems to be more complicated
and will be reviewed/adjusted later.
