staging/rdma/hfi1: Add active and optical cable support

This patch qualifies and tunes active and optical cables for optimal
bit error rate and signal integrity settings. These settings are
fetched from the platform configuration data.

Based on attributes of the QSFP cable as read from the SFF-8636
compliant memory map, we select the appropriate settings from the
platform configuration data (examples: TX/RX equalization, enabling
cable high power, enabling TX/RX clock data recovery mechanisms, and RX
amplitude control) and apply them to the SERDES and QSFP cable.

The platform configuration data also contains system parameters such
as maximum power dissipation supported, and the cables are qualified
based on these parameters. As part of qualifying the cables, the
correct OfflineDisabledReasons are set for the appropriate scenarios.
