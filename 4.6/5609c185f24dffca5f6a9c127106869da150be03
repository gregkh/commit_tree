6lowpan: iphc: add support for stateful compression

This patch introduce support for IPHC stateful address compression. It
will offer the context table via one debugfs entry.
This debugfs has and directory for each cid entry for the context table.
Inside each cid directory there exists the following files:

 - "active": If the entry is added or deleted. The context table is
   original a list implementation, this flag will indicate if the
   context is part of list or not.
 - "prefix": The ipv6 prefix.
 - "prefix_length": The prefix length for the prefix.
 - "compression": The compression flag according RFC6775.

This part should be moved into sysfs after some testing time.

Also the debugfs entry contains a "show" file which is a pretty-printout
for the current context table information.
