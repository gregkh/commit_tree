ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix updating of sysconfig register

Commit 127500ccb766f ("ARM: OMAP2+: Only write the sysconfig on idle
when necessary") talks about verification of sysconfig cache value before
updating it, only during idle path. But the patch is adding the
verification in the enable path. So, adding the check in a proper place
as per the commit description.

Not keeping this check during enable path as there is a chance of losing
context and it is safe to do on idle as the context of the register will
never be lost while the device is active.
