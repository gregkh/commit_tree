batman-adv: remove unused BATADV_BONDING_TQ_THRESHOLD constant

BATADV_BONDING_TQ_THRESHOLD is not used anymore since the implementation
of the bat_neigh_is_similar_or_better() API function.
Such function uses the more generic BATADV_TQ_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD
constant.

Therefore, remove definition of the unused BATADV_BONDING_TQ_THRESHOLD
constant.
