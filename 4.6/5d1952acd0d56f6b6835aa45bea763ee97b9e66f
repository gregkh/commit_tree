cxlflash: Reorder user context initialization

In order to support cxlflash in the PowerVM environment, underlying
hypervisor APIs have imposed a kernel API ordering change.

For the superpipe access to LUN, user applications need a context.
The cxlflash module creates this context by making a sequence of
cxl calls. In the current code, a context is initialized via
cxl_dev_context_init() followed by cxl_process_element(), a function
that obtains the process element id. Finally, cxl_start_work()
is called to attach the process element.

In the PowerVM environment, a process element id cannot be obtained
from the hypervisor until the process element is attached. The
cxlflash module is unable to create contexts without a valid
process element id.

To fix this problem, cxl_start_work() is called before obtaining
the process element id.
