ARM: dts: r8a7791: Don't disable referenced optional clocks

clk_get on a disabled clock node will return EPROBE_DEFER, which can
cause drivers to be deferred forever if such clocks are referenced in
their clocks property.

Update the various disabled external clock nodes to default to a
frequency of 0, but don't disable them to prevent this.
