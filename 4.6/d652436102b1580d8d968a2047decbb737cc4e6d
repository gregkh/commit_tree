mtd: onenand: unexport onenand_default_bbt()

The onenand_default_bbt() function is only used by the OneNAND core
and not by drivers, so there is no real need to export
it. Additionally, the corresponding nand_default_bbt() for regular
NANDs is not exported either, so for consistency reasons, this commit
removes the EXPORT_SYMBOL on onenand_default_bbt().
