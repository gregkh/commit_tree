vfio/pci: Enable virtual register in PCI config space

Typically config space for a device is mapped out into capability
specific handlers and unassigned space.  The latter allows direct
read/write access to config space.  Sometimes we know about registers
living in this void space and would like an easy way to virtualize
them, similar to how BAR registers are managed.  To do this, create
one more pseudo (fake) PCI capability to be handled as purely virtual
space.  Reads and writes are serviced entirely from virtual config
space.
