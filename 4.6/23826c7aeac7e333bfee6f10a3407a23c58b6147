xprtrdma: Serialize credit accounting again

Commit fe97b47cd623 ("xprtrdma: Use workqueue to process RPC/RDMA
replies") replaced the reply tasklet with a workqueue that allows
RPC replies to be processed in parallel. Thus the credit values in
RPC-over-RDMA replies can be applied in a different order than in
which the server sent them.

To fix this, revert commit eba8ff660b2d ("xprtrdma: Move credit
update to RPC reply handler"). Reverting is done by hand to
accommodate code changes that have occurred since then.
