netfilter: nf_conntrack_tcp: Fix stack out of bounds when parsing TCP options

Baozeng Ding reported a KASAN stack out of bounds issue - it uncovered that
the TCP option parsing routines in netfilter TCP connection tracking could
read one byte out of the buffer of the TCP options.  Therefore in the patch
we check that the available data length is large enough to parse both TCP
option code and size.
