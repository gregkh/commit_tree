staging: sm750fb: Use pcim_enable_device()

Devm_ functions allocate memory that is released when a driver
detaches.
Replace pci_enable_device with the managed pcim_enable_device
and remove corresponding pci_disable_device from probe and
suspend functions of a pci_dev.

Also, an unnecessary label has been removed by replacing it
with a direct return statement.
