IB/qib: Remove ibport and use rdmavt version

Remove several ibport members from qib and use the rdmavt version. rc_acks,
rc_qacks, and rc_delayed_comp are defined as per CPU variables in rdmavt.
Add support for these rdmavt per CPU variables which were not per cpu
variables in qib ibport structure.
