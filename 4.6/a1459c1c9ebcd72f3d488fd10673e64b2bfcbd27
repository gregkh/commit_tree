net: phy: spi_ks8895: Don't leak references to SPI devices

The ks8895 driver is using spi_dev_get() apparently just to take a copy
of the SPI device used to instantiate it but never calls spi_dev_put()
to free it.  Since the device is guaranteed to exist between probe() and
remove() there should be no need for the driver to take an extra
reference to it so fix the leak by just using a straight assignment.
