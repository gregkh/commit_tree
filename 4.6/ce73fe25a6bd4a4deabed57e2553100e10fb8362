IB/rdmavt: Remove RVT_FLAGs

While hfi1 and qib were still supporting bits and pieces of core verbs
components there needed to be a way to convey if rdmavt should handle
allocation and initialize of resources like the queue pair table. Now
that all of this is moved into rdmavt there is no need for these flags.
They are no longer used in the drivers.
