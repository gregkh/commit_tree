drm/i915: Apply broader WaRsDisableCoarsePowerGating for guc also

commit 344df9809f45 ("drm/i915/skl: Disable coarse power gating up until F0")
failed to take into account that the same workaround is used in guc
when forcewake is sampled.

Wrap the condition check inside a macro and use it in both places
to fix the guc side scope.
