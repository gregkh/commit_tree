xfs: S_DAX is only for regular files

Only regular files can use DAX for data operations, so we should
restrict setting it on the VFS inode to regular files. Setting it on
metadata inodes may cause the VFS to do the wrong thing for such
inodes, so avoid potential problems by restricting the scope of the
flag to what we know is supported.
