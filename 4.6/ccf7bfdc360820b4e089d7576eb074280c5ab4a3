mmc: core: enable mmc host device to suspend/resume asynchronously

This patch enables mmc hosts to suspend/resume asynchronously.
This will improve system suspend/resume speed. After applying
this patch and enabling all mmc hosts' child devices to
suspend/resume asynchronously on ASUS T100TA, the system
suspend-to-idle time is reduced from 1645ms to 1107ms, and the
system resume time is reduced from 940ms to 914ms.
