mmc: tmio_dma: remove debug messages with little information

When compiling the driver with CONFIG_MMC_DEBUG set, I got build
warnings. They have been 'fixed' meanwhile. However, because these debug
messages look random anyhow (some duplicate information printed etc),
let's just drop them and rather re-add something consistent if that
should ever be needed.
