ARM: 8563/1: fix demoting HWCAP_SWP

Commit b8c9592 "ARM: 8318/1: treat CPU feature register fields as signed
quantities" accidentally altered cpuid register used to demote
HWCAP_SWP.
ARM ARM says that SyncPrim_instrs bits in ID_ISAR3 should be used with
SynchPrim_instrs_frac from ID_ISAR4. So, follow this rule.
