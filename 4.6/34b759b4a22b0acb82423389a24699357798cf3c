ceph: kill ceph_empty_snapc

ceph_empty_snapc->num_snaps == 0 at all times.  Passing such a snapc to
ceph_osdc_alloc_request() (possibly through ceph_osdc_new_request()) is
equivalent to passing NULL, as ceph_osdc_alloc_request() uses it only
for sizing the request message.

Further, in all four cases the subsequent ceph_osdc_build_request() is
passed NULL for snapc, meaning that 0 is encoded for seq and num_snaps
and making ceph_empty_snapc entirely useless.  The two cases where it
actually mattered were removed in commits 860560904962 ("ceph: avoid
sending unnessesary FLUSHSNAP message") and 23078637e054 ("ceph: fix
queuing inode to mdsdir's snaprealm").
