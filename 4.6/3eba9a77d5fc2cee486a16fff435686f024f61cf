Drivers: hv: vmbus: Eliminate the spin lock on the read path

The function hv_ringbuffer_read() is called always on a pre-assigned
CPU. Each chnnel is bound to a specific CPU and this function is
always called on the CPU the channel is bound. There is no need to
acquire the spin lock; get rid of this overhead.
