bpf: introduce BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY map

Primary use case is a histogram array of latency
where bpf program computes the latency of block requests or other
events and stores histogram of latency into array of 64 elements.
All cpus are constantly running, so normal increment is not accurate,
bpf_xadd causes cache ping-pong and this per-cpu approach allows
fastest collision-free counters.
