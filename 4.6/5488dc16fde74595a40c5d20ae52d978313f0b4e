drm: introduce pipe color correction properties

Patch based on a previous series by Shashank Sharma.

This introduces optional properties to enable color correction at the
pipe level. It relies on 3 transformations applied to every pixels
displayed. First a lookup into a degamma table, then a multiplication
of the rgb components by a 3x3 matrix and finally another lookup into
a gamma table.

The following properties can be added to a pipe :
  - DEGAMMA_LUT : blob containing degamma LUT
  - DEGAMMA_LUT_SIZE : number of elements in DEGAMMA_LUT
  - CTM : transformation matrix applied after the degamma LUT
  - GAMMA_LUT : blob containing gamma LUT
  - GAMMA_LUT_SIZE : number of elements in GAMMA_LUT

DEGAMMA_LUT_SIZE and GAMMA_LUT_SIZE are read only properties, set by
the driver to tell userspace applications what sizes should be the
lookup tables in DEGAMMA_LUT and GAMMA_LUT.

A helper is also provided so legacy gamma correction is redirected
through these new properties.

v2: Register LUT size properties as range

v3: Fix round in drm_color_lut_get_value() helper
    More docs on how degamma/gamma properties are used

v4: Update contributors

v5: Rename CTM_MATRIX property to CTM (Doh!)
    Add legacy gamma_set atomic helper
    Describe CTM/LUT acronyms in the kernel doc

v6: Fix missing blob unref in drm_atomic_helper_crtc_reset
