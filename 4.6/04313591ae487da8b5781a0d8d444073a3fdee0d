cgroup: allocate 2x cgrp_cset_links when setting up a new root

During prep, cgroup_setup_root() allocates cgrp_cset_links matching
the number of existing css_sets to later link the new root.  This is
fine for now as the only operation which can happen inbetween is
rebind_subsystems() and rebinding of empty subsystems doesn't create
new css_sets.

However, while not yet allowed, with the recent reimplementation,
rebind_subsystems() can rebind subsystems with descendant csses and
thus can create new css_sets.  This patch makes cgroup_setup_root()
allocate 2x of the existing css_sets so that later use of live
subsystem rebinding doesn't blow up.
