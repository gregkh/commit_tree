Revert "x86: remove the kernel code/data/bss resources from /proc/iomem"

This reverts commit c4004b02f8e5b9ce357a0bb1641756cc86962664.

Sadly, my hope that nobody would actually use the special kernel entries
in /proc/iomem were dashed by kexec.  Which reads /proc/iomem explicitly
to find the kernel base address.  Nasty.

Anyway, that means we can't do the sane and simple thing and just remove
the entries, and we'll instead have to mask them out based on permissions.
