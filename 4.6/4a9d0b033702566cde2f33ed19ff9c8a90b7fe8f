ARM: dts: rockchip: add the sdio power sequence for kylin board

This patch adds the sdio power sequence for kylin board.
The WLAN attached to a SDIO interface, wifi/bluetooth have
reset and power been needed to enable.

AFAIK, the simple power sequence provider sets a value for multiple GPIOs.
So the reset and power of WlAN chip can be handled in mmc power sequence.
On the module itself this is one of these, that should can be handled
by reset GPIOs in simple mmc power sequence.

The Bluetooth host wake is high active from bootup, this patch is also
set pinctrl bias as the default to enable the pull up in soc internal.
