brcmfmac: Configure country code using device specific settings

Country code configuration in a device is a device specific
operation. For this the country code as specified by reg notifier
(iso3166 alpha2) needs to be translated to a device specific
country locale and revision number. This patch adds this
translation and puts a placeholder in the device specific settings
where the translation table can be stored. Additional patches will
be needed to read these tables from for example device platform
data.
