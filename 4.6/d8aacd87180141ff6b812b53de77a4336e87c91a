netfilter: ipset: Check IPSET_ATTR_ETHER netlink attribute length

Julia Lawall pointed out that IPSET_ATTR_ETHER netlink attribute length
was not checked explicitly, just for the maximum possible size. Malicious
netlink clients could send shorter attribute and thus resulting a kernel
read after the buffer.

The patch adds the explicit length checkings.
