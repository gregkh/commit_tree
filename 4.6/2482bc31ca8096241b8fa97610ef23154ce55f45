cpufreq: st: enable selective initialization based on the platform

The sti-cpufreq does unconditional registration of the cpufreq-dt driver
which causes issue on an multi-platform build. For example, on Vexpress
TC2 platform, we get the following error on boot:

cpu cpu0: OPP-v2 not supported
cpu cpu0: Not doing voltage scaling
cpu: dev_pm_opp_of_cpumask_add_table: couldn't find opp table
	for cpu:0, -19
cpu cpu0: dev_pm_opp_get_max_volt_latency: Invalid regulator (-6)
...
arm_big_little: bL_cpufreq_register: Failed registering platform driver:
		vexpress-spc, err: -17

The actual driver fails to initialise as cpufreq-dt is probed
successfully, which is incorrect. This issue can happen to any platform
not using cpufreq-dt in a multi-platform build.

This patch adds a check to do selective initialization of the driver.
