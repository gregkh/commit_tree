KVM: x86: rewrite handling of scaled TSC for kvmclock

This is the same as before:

    kvm_scale_tsc(tgt_tsc_khz)
        = tgt_tsc_khz * ratio
        = tgt_tsc_khz * user_tsc_khz / tsc_khz   (see set_tsc_khz)
        = user_tsc_khz                           (see kvm_guest_time_update)
        = vcpu->arch.virtual_tsc_khz             (see kvm_set_tsc_khz)

However, computing it through kvm_scale_tsc will make it possible
to include the NTP correction in tgt_tsc_khz.
