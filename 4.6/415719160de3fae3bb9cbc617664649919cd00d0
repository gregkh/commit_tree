Drivers: hv: vmbus: avoid scheduling in interrupt context in vmbus_initiate_unload()

We have to call vmbus_initiate_unload() on crash to make kdump work but
the crash can also be happening in interrupt (e.g. Sysrq + c results in
such) where we can't schedule or the following will happen:

[  314.905786] bad: scheduling from the idle thread!

Just skipping the wait (and even adding some random wait here) won't help:
to make host-side magic working we're supposed to receive CHANNELMSG_UNLOAD
(and actually confirm the fact that we received it) but we can't use
interrupt-base path (vmbus_isr()-> vmbus_on_msg_dpc()). Implement a simple
busy wait ignoring all the other messages and use it if we're in an
interrupt context.
