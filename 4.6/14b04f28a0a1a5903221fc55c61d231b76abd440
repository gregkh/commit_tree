clk: gpio: Make into a platform driver

clk_get() for DT based clks already returns EPROBE_DEFER when the
OF clk provider is not present. So having all this code in the
clk provider to return EPROBE_DEFER when the gpio isn't ready yet
can be replaced with a platform driver that doesn't add the clk
provider until the gpio can be requested. Get rid of the
OF_CLK_DECLARE and convert this to a platform driver instead.
