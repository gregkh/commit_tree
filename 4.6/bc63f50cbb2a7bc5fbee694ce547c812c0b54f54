staging: wilc1000: Removed unused variables

Variables pcgroup_encrypt_val,pccipher_group,pcwpa_version,
hold different values at different stages of the execution of
connect(), however they are not being used anywhere.
Hence, the unused variables have been removed.

This was done using Coccinelle.
