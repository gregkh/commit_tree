[media] tc358743: Use local array with fixed size in i2c write

i2c_wr() is called from ops and the interrupt service routine, while
state->wr_data is shared and unprotected, and could be overwritten.

This shared buffer is therefore replaced with a local array with fixed
size. The array has the size of one EDID block (128 bytes) + 2 bytes
i2c address, and the EDID is written block by block (up to 8 blocks).
