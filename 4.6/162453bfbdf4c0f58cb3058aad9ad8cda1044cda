mm: workingset: separate shadow unpacking and refault calculation

Per-cgroup thrash detection will need to derive a live memcg from the
eviction cookie, and doing that inside unpack_shadow() will get nasty
with the reference handling spread over two functions.

In preparation, make unpack_shadow() clearly about extracting static
data, and let workingset_refault() do all the higher-level handling.
