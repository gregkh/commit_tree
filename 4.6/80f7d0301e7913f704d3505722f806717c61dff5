vhost: rename vhost_init_used()

Looking at how callers use this, maybe we should just rename init_used
to vhost_vq_init_access. The _used suffix was a hint that we
access the vq used ring. But maybe what callers care about is
that it must be called after access_ok.

Also, this function manipulates the vq->is_le field which isn't related
to the vq used ring.

This patch simply renames vhost_init_used() to vhost_vq_init_access() as
suggested by Michael.

No behaviour change.
