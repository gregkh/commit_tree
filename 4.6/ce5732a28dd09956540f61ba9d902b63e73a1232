powerpc/powernv: Create separate subcores CPU feature bit

Subcores isn't really part of the 2.07 architecture but currently we
turn it on using the 2.07 feature bit.  Subcores is really a POWER8
specific feature.

This adds a new CPU_FTR bit just for subcores and moves the subcore
init code over to use this.
