PCI: Update VPD definitions

The 'end' tag is actually 0x0f; it's the representation as a small resource
data type tag that's 0x78 (i.e., shifted by 3).  Correct PCI_VPD_STIN_END
and PCI_VPD_SRDT_END accordingly.

Also, add helper functions to extract the resource data type tags for both
large and small resource data types.
