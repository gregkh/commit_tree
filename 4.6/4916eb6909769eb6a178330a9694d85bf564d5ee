i2c: iproc: Support larger TX transfer

The current iProc I2C driver only allows each TX transfer up to 63
bytes (the TX FIFO has a size of 64 bytes, and one byte is reserved
for slave address). This patch enhances the driver to support TX
transfer in each I2C message for up to 65535 bytes (a practical
maximum, since member 'max_write_len' of 'struct i2c_adapter_quirks is
of type 'u16')

This works by loading up the I2C TX FIFO and enabling the TX underrun
interrupt for each burst. After each burst of TX data is finished,
i.e., when the TX FIFO becomes empty, the TX underrun interrupt will be
triggered and another burst of TX data can be loaded into the TX FIFO.
This repeats until all TX data are finished
