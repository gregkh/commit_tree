pinctrl: sunxi: Remove non existing irq's

While I was testing irq's on the cubietruck I found a couple of
not working irq pins. Further diving into the problem it opened
up a mess called "manual".

This so called manual (A20 user manual v1.3 dated 2014-10-10) says:

Pin overview:
    Page 233:       EINT12 is on pin PC19 mux6.
    Page 236:       EINT12 is on pin PH12 mux6.

Now, it is a bit strange to have the same IRQ on 2 different pins,
but I guess this could still be possible hardware wise. But then:

Pin registers:
    Page 253:       EINT12 is *not* on pin PC19.
    Page 281:       EINT12 is on pin PH12.

The manual is so contradicting that further tests had to be made
to see which of the 2 statements where correct.

This patch is based on actual outcome of these tests and not what
the manual says.

Test procedure used:

Connect a 1 pulse per second (GPS) line to the pin.

echo pin### > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo in > /sys/class/gpio/gpio###/direction
echo rising > /sys/class/gpio/gpio###/edge

Check /proc/interrupts if a irq was attached and if irq's where
received.
