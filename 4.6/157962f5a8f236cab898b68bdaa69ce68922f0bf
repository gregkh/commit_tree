arm64: decouple early fixmap init from linear mapping

Since the early fixmap page tables are populated using pages that are
part of the static footprint of the kernel, they are covered by the
initial kernel mapping, and we can refer to them without using __va/__pa
translations, which are tied to the linear mapping.

Since the fixmap page tables are disjoint from the kernel mapping up
to the top level pgd entry, we can refer to bm_pte[] directly, and there
is no need to walk the page tables and perform __pa()/__va() translations
at each step.
