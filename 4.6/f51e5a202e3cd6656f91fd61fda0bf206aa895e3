staging: lustre: osc: osc_request: Declare local function and structure as static

Declare osc_cleanup() function and osc_obd_ops structure as static
since they are defined and called only in this file.

Removed osc_cleanup() function prototype since it wasn't required.

This fixes the following sparse warnings:
drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/osc/osc_request.c:3210:5: warning:
symbol 'osc_cleanup' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/osc/osc_request.c:3259:16: warning:
symbol 'osc_obd_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
