arm64: consistently use p?d_set_huge

Commit 324420bf91f60582 ("arm64: add support for ioremap() block
mappings") added new p?d_set_huge functions which do the hard work to
generate and set a correct block entry.

These differ from open-coded huge page creation in the early page table
code by explicitly setting the P?D_TYPE_SECT bits (which are implicitly
retained by mk_sect_prot() for any valid prot), but are otherwise
identical (and cannot fail on arm64).

For simplicity and consistency, make use of these in the initial page
table creation code.
