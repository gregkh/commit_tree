KVM: MMU: use kvm_sync_page in kvm_sync_pages

If the last argument is true, kvm_unlink_unsync_page is called anyway in
__kvm_sync_page (either by kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page or by __kvm_sync_page
itself).  Therefore, kvm_sync_pages can just call kvm_sync_page, instead
of going through kvm_unlink_unsync_page+__kvm_sync_page.
