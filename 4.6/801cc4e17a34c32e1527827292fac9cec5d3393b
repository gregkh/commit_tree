xfs: debug mode forced buffered write failure

Add a DEBUG mode-only sysfs knob to enable forced buffered write
failure. An additional side effect of this mode is brute force killing
of delayed allocation blocks in the range of the write. The latter is
the prime motiviation behind this patch, as userspace test
infrastructure requires a reliable mechanism to create and split
delalloc extents without causing extent conversion.

Certain fallocate operations (i.e., zero range) were used for this in
the past, but the implementations have changed such that delalloc
extents are flushed and converted to real blocks, rendering the test
useless.
