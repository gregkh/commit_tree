xfs: wire up Q_XGETNEXTQUOTA / get_nextdqblk

Add code to allow the Q_XGETNEXTQUOTA quotactl to quickly find
all active quotas by examining the quota inode, and skipping
over unallocated or uninitialized regions.

Userspace can then use this interface rather than i.e. a
getpwent() loop when asked to report all active quotas.
