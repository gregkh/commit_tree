btrfs: Reset IO error counters before start of device replacing

If device replace entry was found on disk at mounting and its num_write_errors
stats counter has non-NULL value, then replace operation will never be
finished and -EIO error will be reported by btrfs_scrub_dev() because
this counter is never reset.

 # mount -o degraded /media/a4fb5c0a-21c5-4fe7-8d0e-fdd87d5f71ee/
 # btrfs replace status /media/a4fb5c0a-21c5-4fe7-8d0e-fdd87d5f71ee/

 # btrfs replace start -B 4 /dev/sdg /media/a4fb5c0a-21c5-4fe7-8d0e-fdd87d5f71ee/
 ERROR: ioctl(DEV_REPLACE_START) failed on "/media/a4fb5c0a-21c5-4fe7-8d0e-fdd87d5f71ee/": Input/output error, no error

Reset num_write_errors and num_uncorrectable_read_errors counters in the
dev_replace structure before start of replacing.
