x86/nmi: Mark 'ignore_nmis' as __read_mostly

ignore_nmis is used in two distinct places:

 1. modified through {stop,restart}_nmi by alternative_instructions
 2. read by do_nmi to determine if default_do_nmi should be called or not

thus the access pattern conforms to __read_mostly and do_nmi() is a fastpath.
