ath9k: fix buffer overrun for ar9287

Code that was added back in 2.6.38 has an obvious overflow
when accessing a static array, and at the time it was added
only a code comment was put in front of it as a reminder
to have it reviewed properly.

This has not happened, but gcc-6 now points to the specific
overflow:

drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/eeprom.c: In function 'ath9k_hw_get_gain_boundaries_pdadcs':
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/eeprom.c:483:44: error: array subscript is above array bounds [-Werror=array-bounds]
     maxPwrT4[i] = data_9287[idxL].pwrPdg[i][4];
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~

It turns out that the correct array length exists in the local
'intercepts' variable of this function, so we can just use that
instead of hardcoding '4', so this patch changes all three
instances to use that variable. The other two instances were
already correct, but it's more consistent this way.
