dell-wmi: Stop storing pointers to DMI tables

The dmi_walk function maps the DMI table, walks it, and unmaps it.
This means that the dell_bios_hotkey_table that find_hk_type stores
points to unmapped memory by the time it gets read.

I've been able to trigger crashes caused by the stale pointer a
couple of times, but never on a stock kernel.

Fix it by generating the keymap in the dmi_walk callback instead of
storing a pointer.
