samples/bpf: offwaketime example

This is simplified version of Brendan Gregg's offwaketime:
This program shows kernel stack traces and task names that were blocked and
"off-CPU", along with the stack traces and task names for the threads that woke
them, and the total elapsed time from when they blocked to when they were woken
up. The combined stacks, task names, and total time is summarized in kernel
context for efficiency.

Example:
$ sudo ./offwaketime | flamegraph.pl > demo.svg
Open demo.svg in the browser as FlameGraph visualization.
