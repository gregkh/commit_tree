apple-gmux: Fix build breakage if !CONFIG_ACPI

The DRM drivers i915, nouveau and radeon may be compiled with
CONFIG_ACPI not set, in which case acpi_dev_present() is undefined.

Add a no-op stub for apple_gmux_present() which is used if
CONFIG_APPLE_GMUX is not enabled to avoid build breakage.
(CONFIG_APPLE_GMUX depends on CONFIG_ACPI.)
