libceph: monc hunt rate is 3s with backoff up to 30s

Unless we are in the process of setting up a client (i.e. connecting to
the monitor cluster for the first time), apply a backoff: every time we
want to reopen a session, increase our timeout by a multiple (currently
2); when we complete the connection, reduce that multipler by 50%.

Mirrors ceph.git commit 794c86fd289bd62a35ed14368fa096c46736e9a2.
