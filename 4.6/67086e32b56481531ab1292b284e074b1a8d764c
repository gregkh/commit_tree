powerpc/eeh: powerpc/eeh: Support error recovery for VF PE

PFs are enumerated on PCI bus, while VFs are created by PF's driver.

In EEH recovery, it has two cases:
1. Device and driver is EEH aware, error handlers are called.
2. Device and driver is not EEH aware, un-plug the device and plug it again
by enumerating it.

The special thing happens on the second case. For a PF, we could use the
original pci core to enumerate the bus, while for VF we need to record the
VFs which aer un-plugged then plug it again.

Also The patch caches the VF index in pci_dn, which can be used to
calculate VF's bus, device and function number. Those information helps to
locate the VF's PCI device instance when doing hotplug during EEH recovery
if necessary.
