nvmem: core: return error for non word aligned access

nvmem providers have restrictions on register strides, so return error
when users attempt to read/write buffers with sizes which are less
than word size.

Without this patch the userspace would continue to try as it does not
get any error from the nvmem core, resulting in a hang or endless loop
in userspace.
