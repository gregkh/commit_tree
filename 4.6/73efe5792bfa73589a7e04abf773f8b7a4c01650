soc: mediatek: PMIC wrap: Clear the vldclr if state machine stay on FSM_VLDCLR state.

Sometimes PMIC is too busy to send data in time to cause pmic wrap timeout,
because pmic wrap is waiting for FSM_VLDCLR after finishing WACS2_CMD. It
just return error when issue happened, so the state machine will stay on
FSM_VLDCLR state when data send back later by PMIC and timeout again in next
time because pmic wrap waiting for FSM_IDLE state at the beginning of the
read/write function.

Clear the vldclr when timeout if state machine stay on FSM_VLDCLR.
