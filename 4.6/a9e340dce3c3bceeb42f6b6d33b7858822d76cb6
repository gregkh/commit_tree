Input: rotary_encoder - move away from platform data structure

Drop support for platform data passed via a C-structure and switch to
device properties instead, which should make the driver compatible with all
platforms: OF, ACPI and static boards. Static boards should use property
sets to communicate device parameters to the driver.
