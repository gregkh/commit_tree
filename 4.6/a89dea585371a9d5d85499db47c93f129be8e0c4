arm64: defer __va translation of initrd_start and initrd_end

Before deferring the assignment of memstart_addr in a subsequent patch, to
the moment where all memory has been discovered and possibly clipped based
on the size of the linear region and the presence of a mem= command line
parameter, we need to ensure that memstart_addr is not used to perform __va
translations before it is assigned.

One such use is in the generic early DT discovery of the initrd location,
which is recorded as a virtual address in the globals initrd_start and
initrd_end. So wire up the generic support to declare the initrd addresses,
and implement it without __va() translations, and perform the translation
after memstart_addr has been assigned.
