earlycon: Use common framework for earlycon declarations

Use a single common table of struct earlycon_id for both command line
and devicetree. Re-define OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE() macro to instance a
unique earlycon declaration (the declaration is only guaranteed to be
unique within a compilation unit; separate compilation units must still
use unique earlycon names).

The semantics of OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE() is different; it declares an
earlycon which can matched either on the command line or by devicetree.
EARLYCON_DECLARE() is semantically unchanged; it declares an earlycon
which is matched by command line only. Remove redundant instances of
EARLYCON_DECLARE().

This enables all earlycons to properly initialize struct console
with the appropriate name and index, which improves diagnostics and
enables direct earlycon-to-console handoff.
