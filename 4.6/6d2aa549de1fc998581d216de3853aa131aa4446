arm64: mm: check at build time that PAGE_OFFSET divides the VA space evenly

Commit 8439e62a1561 ("arm64: mm: use bit ops rather than arithmetic in
pa/va translations") changed the boundary check against PAGE_OFFSET from
an arithmetic comparison to a bit test. This means we now silently assume
that PAGE_OFFSET is a power of 2 that divides the kernel virtual address
space into two equal halves. So make that assumption explicit.
