block: loop: fix filesystem corruption in case of aio/dio

Starting from commit e36f620428(block: split bios to max possible length),
block core starts to split bio in the middle of bvec.

Unfortunately loop dio/aio doesn't consider this situation, and
always treat 'iter.iov_offset' as zero. Then filesystem corruption
is observed.

This patch figures out the offset of the base bvevc via
'bio->bi_iter.bi_bvec_done' and fixes the issue by passing the offset
to iov iterator.
