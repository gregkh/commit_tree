fbdev: da8xx-fb: fix videomodes of lcd panels

Commit 028cd86b794f4a ("video: da8xx-fb: fix the polarities of the
hsync/vsync pulse") fixes polarities of HSYNC/VSYNC pulse but
forgot to update known_lcd_panels[] which had sync values
according to old logic. This breaks LCD at least on DA850 EVM.

This patch fixes this issue and I have tested this for panel
"Sharp_LK043T1DG01" using DA850 EVM board.
