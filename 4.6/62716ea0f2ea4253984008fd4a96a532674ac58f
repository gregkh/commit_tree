cgroup: use ->subtree_control when testing no internal process rule

No internal process rule is enforced by cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst()
during process migration.  It tests whether the target cgroup's
->child_subsys_mask is zero which is different from "subtree_control"
write path which tests ->subtree_control.  This hasn't mattered
because up until now, both ->child_subsys_mask and ->subtree_control
are zero or non-zero at the same time.  However, with the planned
addition of implicit controllers, this will no longer be true.

This patch prepares for the change by making
cgorup_migrate_prepare_dst() test ->subtree_control instead.
