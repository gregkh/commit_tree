arm64: move kernel image to base of vmalloc area

This moves the module area to right before the vmalloc area, and moves
the kernel image to the base of the vmalloc area. This is an intermediate
step towards implementing KASLR, which allows the kernel image to be
located anywhere in the vmalloc area.

Since other subsystems such as hibernate may still need to refer to the
kernel text or data segments via their linears addresses, both are mapped
in the linear region as well. The linear alias of the text region is
mapped read-only/non-executable to prevent inadvertent modification or
execution.
