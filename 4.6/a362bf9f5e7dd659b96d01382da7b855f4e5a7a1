x86/cpufeature: Get rid of the non-asm goto variant

I can simply quote hpa from the mail:

  "Get rid of the non-asm goto variant and just fall back to
   dynamic if asm goto is unavailable. It doesn't make any sense,
   really, if it is supposed to be safe, and by now the asm
   goto-capable gcc is in more wide use. (Originally the gcc 3.x
   fallback to pure dynamic didn't exist, either.)"

Booy, am I lazy.

Cleanup the whole CC_HAVE_ASM_GOTO ifdeffery too, while at it.
