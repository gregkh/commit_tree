staging: lustre: missed a few cases of using NULL instead of 0

It is preferable to use NULL instead of 0 for pointers. This fixes sparse
warnings such as:

lustre/fld/fld_request.c:126:17: warning: Using plain integer as NULL pointer

The second parameter of class_match_param() was changed to a const, to
be able to remove a cast in one user, to prevent splitting a long
line. No other code change.
