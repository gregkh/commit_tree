Staging: rts5208: rtsx_transport.c: Align to open parenthesis

This patch fixes the alignment issue reported by checkpatch.pl:

CHECK: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Add a unsigned char *sgbuffer in rtsx_stor_access_xfer_buffer to make the
following memcpy logic easier to read.

Add a struct scatterlist *sg in the use_sg branch of
rtsx_transfer_data_partial to make the parameters of the
rtsx_transfer_sglist_adma_partial call fit in 80 character lines after
aligning them to the open parenthesis.

Refactor memcpy logic in rtsx_stor_access_xfer_buf to make it more legible.
