x86/mce: Check for faults tagged in EXTABLE_CLASS_FAULT exception table entries

Extend the severity checking code to add a new context IN_KERN_RECOV
which is used to indicate that the machine check was triggered by code
in the kernel tagged with _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() so that the ex_handler_fault()
handler will provide the fixup code with the trap number.

Major re-work to the tail code in do_machine_check() to make all this
readable/maintainable. One functional change is that tolerant=3 no longer
stops recovery actions. Revert to only skipping sending SIGBUS to the
current process.
