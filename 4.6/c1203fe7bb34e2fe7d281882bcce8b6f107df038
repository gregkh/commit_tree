net: hns: bug fix about getting hilink status for HNS v2

The hilink status reg in HNS V2 is different from HNS v1. In HNS V2, It
distinguishes differnt lane status according to the bit-field of the reg.
As is shown below:
[0:0] ---> lane0
[1:1] ---> lane1
...

But the current driver reads the reg to get the hilink status ONLY
concidering HNS V1 situation. Here is a patch to support both of them.
