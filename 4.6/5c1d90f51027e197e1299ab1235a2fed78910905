x86/mm/pkeys: Add PTE bits for storing protection key

Previous documentation has referred to these 4 bits as "ignored".
That means that software could have made use of them.  But, as
far as I know, the kernel never used them.

They are still ignored when protection keys is not enabled, so
they could theoretically still get used for software purposes.

We also implement "empty" versions so that code that references
to them can be optimized away by the compiler when the config
option is not enabled.
