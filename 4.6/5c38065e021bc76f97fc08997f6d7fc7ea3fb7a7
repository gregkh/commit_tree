seccomp: check in_compat_syscall, not is_compat_task, in strict mode

Seccomp wants to know the syscall bitness, not the caller task bitness,
when it selects the syscall whitelist.

As far as I know, this makes no difference on any architecture, so it's
not a security problem.  (It generates identical code everywhere except
sparc, and, on sparc, the syscall numbering is the same for both ABIs.)
