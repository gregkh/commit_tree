drivers/firmware/broadcom/bcm47xx_nvram.c: fix incorrect __ioread32_copy

Commit 1f330c327900 ("drivers/firmware/broadcom/bcm47xx_nvram.c: use
__ioread32_copy() instead of open-coding") switched to use a generic
copy function, but failed to notice that the header pointer is updated
between the two copies, resulting in bogus data being copied in the
latter one.  Fix by keeping the old header pointer.

The patch fixes totally broken networking on WRT54GL router (both LAN and
WLAN interfaces fail to probe).
