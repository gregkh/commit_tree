arm64: KVM: Add access handler for event counter register

These kind of registers include PMEVCNTRn, PMCCNTR and PMXEVCNTR which
is mapped to PMEVCNTRn.

The access handler translates all aarch32 register offsets to aarch64
ones and uses vcpu_sys_reg() to access their values to avoid taking care
of big endian.

When reading these registers, return the sum of register value and the
value perf event counts.
