mm/zsmalloc: add `freeable' column to pool stat

Add a new column to pool stats, which will tell how many pages ideally
can be freed by class compaction, so it will be easier to analyze
zsmalloc fragmentation.

At the moment, we have only numbers of FULL and ALMOST_EMPTY classes,
but they don't tell us how badly the class is fragmented internally.

The new /sys/kernel/debug/zsmalloc/zramX/classes output look as follows:

 class  size almost_full almost_empty obj_allocated   obj_used pages_used pages_per_zspage freeable

    57   944           0            0             0          0          0                3        0
[..]
 Total                26          131         12709      10994       1071                       134

For example, from this particular output we can easily conclude that
class-896 is heavily fragmented -- it occupies 26 pages, 12 can be freed
by compaction.
