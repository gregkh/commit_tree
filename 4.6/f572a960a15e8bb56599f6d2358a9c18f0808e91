vfio/pci: Intel IGD host and LCP bridge config space access

Provide read-only access to PCI config space of the PCI host bridge
and LPC bridge through device specific regions.  This may be used to
configure a VM with matching register contents to satisfy driver
requirements.  Providing this through the vfio file descriptor removes
an additional userspace requirement for access through pci-sysfs and
removes the CAP_SYS_ADMIN requirement that doesn't appear to apply to
the specific devices we're accessing.
