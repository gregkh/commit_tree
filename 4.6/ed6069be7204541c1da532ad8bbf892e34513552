xen/apic: Provide Xen-specific version of cpu_present_to_apicid APIC op

Currently Xen uses default_cpu_present_to_apicid() which will always
report BAD_APICID for PV guests since x86_bios_cpu_apic_id is initialised
to that value and is never updated.

With commit 1f12e32f4cd5 ("x86/topology: Create logical package id"), this
op is now called by smp_init_package_map() when deciding whether to call
topology_update_package_map() which sets cpu_data(cpu).logical_proc_id.
The latter (as topology_logical_package_id(cpu)) may be used, for example,
by cpu_to_rapl_pmu() as an array index. Since uninitialized
logical_package_id is set to -1, the index will become 64K which is
obviously problematic.

While RAPL code (and any other users of logical_package_id) should be
careful in their assumptions about id's validity, Xen's
cpu_present_to_apicid op should still provide value consistent with its
own xen_apic_read(APIC_ID).
