clk: sunxi: don't mark sun6i_ar100_data __initconst

The clk-sun6i-ar100 clk driver is a platform driver that may use
deferred probing, so its probe function must not access
__init symbols. Kbuild warns about this:

WARNING: drivers/clk/sunxi/built-in.o(.text+0x15f0): Section mismatch in reference from the function sun6i_a31_ar100_clk_probe() to the (unknown reference) .init.rodata:(unknown)
The function sun6i_a31_ar100_clk_probe() references
the (unknown reference) __initconst (unknown).
This is often because sun6i_a31_ar100_clk_probe lacks a __initconst
annotation or the annotation of (unknown) is wrong.

Removing the __initconst annotation avoids the warning and makes
deferred probing work.
