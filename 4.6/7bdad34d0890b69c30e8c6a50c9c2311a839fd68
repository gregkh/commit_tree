cpufreq: governor: Rename some data types and variables

The ondemand and conservative governors are represented by
struct common_dbs_data whose name doesn't reflect the purpose it
is used for, so rename it to struct dbs_governor and rename
variables of that type accordingly.

No functional changes.
