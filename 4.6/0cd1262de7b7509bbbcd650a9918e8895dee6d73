drm/i915: Handle error paths during watermark sanitization properly (v3)

sanitize_watermarks() does not properly handle errors returned by
drm_atomic_helper_duplicate_state().  Make failures drop locks before
returning.  We also change the lock of connection_mutex to a
drm_modeset_lock_all_ctx() to make sure any EDEADLK's are handled
earlier.

v2: Change call to lock connetion_mutex with a call to
    drm_modeset_lock_all_ctx().  This ensures that any lock contention
    is handled earlier and drm_atomic_helper_duplicate_state() won't
    return EDEADLK. (Maarten)

v3: Drop locks properly in more error paths. (Maarten)
