PCI: Include pci/pcie/Kconfig directly from pci/Kconfig

Include pci/pcie/Kconfig directly from pci/Kconfig, so arches don't
have to source both pci/Kconfig and pci/pcie/Kconfig.

Note that this effectively adds pci/pcie/Kconfig to the following
arches, because they already sourced drivers/pci/Kconfig but they
previously did not source drivers/pci/pcie/Kconfig:

  alpha
  avr32
  blackfin
  frv
  m32r
  m68k
  microblaze
  mn10300
  parisc
  sparc
  unicore32
  xtensa

[bhelgaas: changelog, source pci/pcie/Kconfig at top of pci/Kconfig, whitespace]
