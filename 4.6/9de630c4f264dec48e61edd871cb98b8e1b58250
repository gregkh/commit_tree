rcu: Document unique-name limitation for DEFINE_STATIC_SRCU()

SRCU uses per-CPU variables, and DEFINE_STATIC_SRCU() uses a static
per-CPU variable.  However, per-CPU variables have significant
restrictions, for example, names of per-CPU variables must be globally
unique, even if declared static.  These restrictions carry over to
DEFINE_STATIC_SRCU(), and this commit therefore documents these
restrictions.
