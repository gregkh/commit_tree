drm/i915/guc: Move GuC wq_check_space to alloc_request_extras

Split GuC work queue space checking from submission and move it to
ring_alloc_request_extras. The reason is that failure in later
i915_add_request() won't be handled. In the case timeout happens,
driver can return early in order to handle the error.

v1: Move wq_reserve_space to ring_reserve_space
v2: Move wq_reserve_space to alloc_request_extras (Chris Wilson)
v3: The work queue head pointer is cached by driver now. So we can
    quickly return if space is available.
    s/reserve/check/g (Dave Gordon)
v4: Update cached wq head after ring doorbell; check wq space before
    ring doorbell in case unexpected error happens; call wq space
    check only when GuC submission is enabled. (Dave Gordon)
