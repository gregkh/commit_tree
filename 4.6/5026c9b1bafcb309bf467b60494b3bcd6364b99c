net sched: vlan action fix late binding

Late vlan action binding was broken and is fixed with this patch.

//add a vlan action to pop and give it an instance id of 1
sudo tc actions add action vlan pop index 1
//create filter which binds to vlan action id 1
sudo tc filter add dev $DEV parent ffff: protocol ip prio 1 u32 \
match ip dst 17.0.0.1/32 flowid 1:1 action vlan index 1

current message(before bug fix) was:
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
We have an error talking to the kernel
