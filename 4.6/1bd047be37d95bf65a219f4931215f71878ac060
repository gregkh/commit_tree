tpm_crb: Use devm_ioremap_resource

To support the force mode in tpm_tis we need to use resource locking
in tpm_crb as well, via devm_ioremap_resource.

The light restructuring better aligns crb and tis and makes it easier
to see the that new changes make sense.

The control area and its associated buffers do not always fall in the
range of the iomem resource given by the ACPI object. This patch fixes
the issue by mapping the buffers if this is the case.
