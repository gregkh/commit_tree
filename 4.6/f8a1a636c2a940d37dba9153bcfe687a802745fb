net: hns: fixed portid bug in sending manage pkt

In chip V2, the default value of port id in tx BD is Zero. If it is not
configurated to the other value, all management packets will be sent out
from port0. So port_id in the tx BD needs to be updated when sending a
management packet.

In V2 chip, when sending mamagement packets, the driver should
config the port id to BD descs.
