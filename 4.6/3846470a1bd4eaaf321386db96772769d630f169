scsi: Export function scsi_scan.c:sanitize_inquiry_string

The hpsa driver uses this function to cleanup inquiry data. Our new pqi
driver will also use this function. This function was copied into both
drivers.

This patch exports sanitize_inquiry_string so the hpsa and the pqi
drivers can use this function directly.
