compiler-gcc: require gcc 4.8 for powerpc __builtin_bswap16()

gcc support for __builtin_bswap16() was supposedly added for powerpc in
gcc 4.6, and was then later added for other architectures in gcc 4.8.

However, Stephen Rothwell reported that attempting to use it on powerpc
in gcc 4.6 fails with:

  lib/vsprintf.c:160:2: error: initializer element is not constant
  lib/vsprintf.c:160:2: error: (near initialization for 'decpair[0]')
  lib/vsprintf.c:160:2: error: initializer element is not constant
  lib/vsprintf.c:160:2: error: (near initialization for 'decpair[1]')
  ...

I'm not entirely sure what those errors mean, but I don't see them on
gcc 4.8.  So let's consider gcc 4.8 to be the official starting point
for __builtin_bswap16().

Arnd Bergmann adds:
 "I found the commit in gcc-4.8 that replaced the powerpc-specific
  implementation of __builtin_bswap16 with an architecture-independent
  one.  Apparently the powerpc version (gcc-4.6 and 4.7) just mapped to
  the lhbrx/sthbrx instructions, so it ended up not being a constant,
  though the intent of the patch was mainly to add support for the
  builtin to x86:

    https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52624

  has the patch that went into gcc-4.8 and more information."
