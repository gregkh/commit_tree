PCI: designware: Add generic dw_pcie_wait_for_link()

Several DesignWare-based drivers (dra7xx, exynos, imx6, keystone, qcom, and
spear13xx) had similar loops waiting for the link to come up.

Add a generic dw_pcie_wait_for_link() for use by all these drivers so the
waiting is done consistently, e.g., always using usleep_range() rather than
mdelay() and using similar timeouts and retry counts.

Note that this changes the Keystone link training/wait for link strategy,
so we initiate link training, then wait longer for the link to come up
before re-initiating link training.
