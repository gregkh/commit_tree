objtool: Mark non-standard object files and directories

Code which runs outside the kernel's normal mode of operation often does
unusual things which can cause a static analysis tool like objtool to
emit false positive warnings:

 - boot image
 - vdso image
 - relocation
 - realmode
 - efi
 - head
 - purgatory
 - modpost

Set OBJECT_FILES_NON_STANDARD for their related files and directories,
which will tell objtool to skip checking them.  It's ok to skip them
because they don't affect runtime stack traces.

Also skip the following code which does the right thing with respect to
frame pointers, but is too "special" to be validated by a tool:

 - entry
 - mcount

Also skip the test_nx module because it modifies its exception handling
table at runtime, which objtool can't understand.  Fortunately it's
just a test module so it doesn't matter much.

Currently objtool is the only user of OBJECT_FILES_NON_STANDARD, but it
might eventually be useful for other tools.
