Btrfs: btrfs_ioctl_clone: Truncate complete page after performing clone operation

In subpagesize-blocksize scenario, the "destination offset" argument passed to
the btrfs_ioctl_clone() can be aligned to sectorsize but may not be
necessarily aligned to the machine's page size. In such cases,
truncate_inode_pages_range() ends up zeroing out the partial page and future
read operations will return incorrect data. Hence this commit explicitly
rounds down the "destination offset" to the machine's page size.
