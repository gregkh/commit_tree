tipc: fix link attribute propagation bug

Changing certain link attributes (link tolerance and link priority)
from the TIPC management tool is supposed to automatically take
effect at both endpoints of the affected link.

Currently the media address is not instantiated for the link and is
used uninstantiated when crafting protocol messages designated for the
peer endpoint. This means that changing a link property currently
results in the property being changed on the local machine but the
protocol message designated for the peer gets lost. Resulting in
property discrepancy between the endpoints.

In this patch we resolve this by using the media address from the
link entry and using the bearer transmit function to send it. Hence,
we can now eliminate the redundant function tipc_link_prot_xmit() and
the redundant field tipc_link::media_addr.
