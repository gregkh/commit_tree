btrfs: do not write corrupted metadata blocks to disk

csum_dirty_buffer was issuing a warning in case the extent buffer
did not look alright, but was still returning success.
Let's return error in this case, and also add an additional sanity
check on the extent buffer header.
The caller up the chain may BUG_ON on this, for example flush_epd_write_bio will,
but it is better than to have a silent metadata corruption on disk.
