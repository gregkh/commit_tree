orangefs: Remove ``aligned'' upcall and downcall length macros.

There was previously MAX_ALIGNED_DEV_REQ_(UP|DOWN)SIZE macros which
evaluated to MAX_DEV_REQ_(UP|DOWN)SIZE+8. As it is unclear what this is
for, other than creating a situation where we accept more data than we
can parse, it is removed.
