nvmem: core: fix error path in nvmem_add_cells()

The current code fails to nvmem_cell_drop(cells[0]) - even worse, if
the loop above fails already at i==0, we'll enter an essentially
infinite loop doing nvmem_cell_drop on cells[-1], cells[-2], ... which
is unlikely to end well.

Also, we're not freeing the temporary backing array cells on the error
path.
