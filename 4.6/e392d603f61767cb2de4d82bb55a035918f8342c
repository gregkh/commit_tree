clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Enable and verify MMIO access

So far, we have been blindly assuming that having access to a
memory-mapped timer frame implies that the individual elements of that
frame frame are already enabled. Whilst it's the firmware's job to give
us non-secure access to frames in the first place, we should not rely
on implementations always being generous enough to also configure CNTACR
for those non-secure frames (e.g. [1]).

Explicitly enable feature-level access per-frame, and verify that the
access we want is really implemented before trying to make use of it.
