cpufreq: governor: Rename cpu_common_dbs_info to policy_dbs_info

The struct cpu_common_dbs_info structure represents the per-policy
part of the governor data (for the ondemand and conservative
governors), but its name doesn't reflect its purpose.

Rename it to struct policy_dbs_info and rename variables related to
it accordingly.

No functional changes.
