vfio/pci: Fix unsigned comparison overflow

Signed versus unsigned comparisons are implicitly cast to unsigned,
which result in a couple possible overflows.  For instance (start +
count) might overflow and wrap, getting through our validation test.
Also when unwinding setup, -1 being compared as unsigned doesn't
produce the intended stop condition.  Fix both of these and also fix
vfio_msi_set_vector_signal() to validate parameters before using the
vector index, though none of the callers should pass bad indexes
anymore.
