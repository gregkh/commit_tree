sctp: fix copying more bytes than expected in sctp_add_bind_addr

Dmitry reported that sctp_add_bind_addr may read more bytes than
expected in case the parameter is a IPv4 addr supplied by the user
through calls such as sctp_bindx_add(), because it always copies
sizeof(union sctp_addr) while the buffer may be just a struct
sockaddr_in, which is smaller.

This patch then fixes it by limiting the memcpy to the min between the
union size and a (new parameter) provided addr size. Where possible this
parameter still is the size of that union, except for reading from
user-provided buffers, which then it accounts for protocol type.
