drm/i915: Cleanup some of the CSB handling

I think this patch is a worthwhile cleanup even if it might look only marginally
useful. It gets more useful in upcoming patches and for handling of future GEN
platforms.

The only non-mechanical part of this is the removal of the extra & operation on
the ring->next_context_status_buffer. This is safe because right above this, we
already did a modulus operation.
