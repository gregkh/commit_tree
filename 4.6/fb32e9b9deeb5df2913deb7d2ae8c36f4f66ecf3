watchdog: Make set_timeout function optional

For some watchdogs, the watchdog driver handles timeout changes without
explicitly setting any registers. In this situation, the watchdog driver
might only set the 'timeout' variable but do nothing else.
This can as well be handled by the infrastructure, so make the set_timeout
callback optional. If WDIOF_SETTIMEOUT is configured but the .set_timeout
callback is not available, update the timeout variable in the
infrastructure code.
