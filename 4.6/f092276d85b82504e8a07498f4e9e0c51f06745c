net: Add MSG_BATCH flag

Add a new msg flag called MSG_BATCH. This flag is used in sendmsg to
indicate that more messages will follow (i.e. a batch of messages is
being sent). This is similar to MSG_MORE except that the following
messages are not merged into one packet, they are sent individually.
sendmmsg is updated so that each contained message except for the
last one is marked as MSG_BATCH.

MSG_BATCH is a performance optimization in cases where a socket
implementation can benefit by transmitting packets in a batch.
