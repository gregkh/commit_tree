net: Optimize local checksum offload

This patch takes advantage of several assumptions we can make about the
headers of the frame in order to reduce overall processing overhead for
computing the outer header checksum.

First we can assume the entire header is in the region pointed to by
skb->head as this is what csum_start is based on.

Second, as a result of our first assumption, we can just call csum_partial
instead of making a call to skb_checksum which would end up having to
configure things so that we could walk through the frags list.
