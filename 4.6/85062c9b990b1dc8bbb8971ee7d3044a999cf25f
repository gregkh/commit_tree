rtc: rv8803: workaround i2c HW issue

The rv8803 has a 60Âµs window where it will not answer on the i2c bus.
It also means there will be no ack for the communication. Make sure
communication is tried multiple times when this happens (the i2c subsystem
mandates -ENXIO is that case but the number of retries is host specific).
The critical parts are the probe function and the alarm callback so make
sure we handle the failure there.
