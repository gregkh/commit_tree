of: earlycon: Initialize port fields from DT properties

Read the optional "reg-offset", "reg-shift", "reg-io-width" and endianness
properties and initialize the respective struct uart_port field if found.

NB: These bindings are common to several drivers and the values merely
indicate the default value; the registering earlycon setup() method can
simply override the values if required.
