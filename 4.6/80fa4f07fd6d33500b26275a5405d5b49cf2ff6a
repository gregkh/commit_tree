[media] usbtv: discard redundant video fields

There are many dropped fields with some sources, leading to many
redundant fields without counterparts. When this redundant field
is odd, a new frame is pushed containing this odd field interleaved
with whatever was left in the buffer, causing video artifacts.

Do not push a new frame after processing every odd field, but do it
only after those which come after an even field.
