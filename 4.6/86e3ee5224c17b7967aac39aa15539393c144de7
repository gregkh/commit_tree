perf tools: Remove nr_sort_keys field

The nr_sort_keys field is to carry the number of sort entries in a
hpp_list or hists to determine the depth of indentation of a hist entry.
As it's only used in hierarchy mode and now we have used nr_hpp_node for
this reason, there's no need to keep it anymore.  Let's get rid of it.
