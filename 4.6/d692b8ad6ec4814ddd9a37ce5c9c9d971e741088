arm64: KVM: Add access handler for PMUSERENR register

This register resets as unknown in 64bit mode while it resets as zero
in 32bit mode. Here we choose to reset it as zero for consistency.

PMUSERENR_EL0 holds some bits which decide whether PMU registers can be
accessed from EL0. Add some check helpers to handle the access from EL0.

When these bits are zero, only reading PMUSERENR will trap to EL2 and
writing PMUSERENR or reading/writing other PMU registers will trap to
EL1 other than EL2 when HCR.TGE==0. To current KVM configuration
(HCR.TGE==0) there is no way to get these traps. Here we write 0xf to
physical PMUSERENR register on VM entry, so that it will trap PMU access
from EL0 to EL2. Within the register access handler we check the real
value of guest PMUSERENR register to decide whether this access is
allowed. If not allowed, return false to inject UND to guest.
