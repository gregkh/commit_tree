ACPICA: Namespace: Ensure \_SB._INI executed before any _REG

ACPICA commit 8ae25b8d128b6b8509010be321ff6bf2760f3807

There is BIOS code relying on the fact that \_SB._INI should get evaluated
before any other control methods. This may implies a gap in ACPICA/Linux
initialization/enumeration process.

Before revealing Windows true behavior by more validations, this patch only
ensures \_SB._INI evaluated before any _REG control methods. This can help
to make progress to other initialization order fixes. Lv Zheng.
