xtensa: make fake NMI configurable

Do not always use fake NMI when safe, provide Kconfig option instead.
Print a warning if fake NMI is chosen in unsafe configuration, but allow
it, because it may work if the user knows that interrupts with
priorities at or above PMM IRQ are not used. Add a check to NMI handler
that BUGs if any of these IRQs fire.
