staging: lustre: lnet: config: Use list_for_each_entry_safe

Doubly linked lists which are  iterated  using list_empty
and list_entry macros have been replaced with list_for_each_entry_safe
macro.
This makes the iteration simpler and more readable.

This patch replaces the while loop containing list_empty and list_entry
with list_for_each_entry_safe.

This was done with Coccinelle.
