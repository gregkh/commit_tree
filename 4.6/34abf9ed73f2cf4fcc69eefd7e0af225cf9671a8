i40iw: Replace the obsolete crypto hash interface with shash

This patch replaces the obsolete crypto hash interface with shash
and resolves a build failure after merge of the rdma tree
which is caused by the removal of crypto hash interface

Removing CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC from crypto_alloc_shash(),
because it is by definition sync only
