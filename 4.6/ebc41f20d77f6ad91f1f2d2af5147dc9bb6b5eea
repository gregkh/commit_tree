panic: change nmi_panic from macro to function

Commit 1717f2096b54 ("panic, x86: Fix re-entrance problem due to panic
on NMI") and commit 58c5661f2144 ("panic, x86: Allow CPUs to save
registers even if looping in NMI context") introduced nmi_panic() which
prevents concurrent/recursive execution of panic().  It also saves
registers for the crash dump on x86.

However, there are some cases where NMI handlers still use panic().
This patch set partially replaces them with nmi_panic() in those cases.

Even this patchset is applied, some NMI or similar handlers (e.g.  MCE
handler) continue to use panic().  This is because I can't test them
well and actual problems won't happen.  For example, the possibility
that normal panic and panic on MCE happen simultaneously is very low.

This patch (of 3):

Convert nmi_panic() to a proper function and export it instead of
exporting internal implementation details to modules, for obvious
reasons.
