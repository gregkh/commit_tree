powerpc32: move xxxxx_dcache_range() functions inline

flush/clean/invalidate _dcache_range() functions are all very
similar and are quite short. They are mainly used in __dma_sync()
perf_event locate them in the top 3 consumming functions during
heavy ethernet activity

They are good candidate for inlining, as __dma_sync() does
almost nothing but calling them
