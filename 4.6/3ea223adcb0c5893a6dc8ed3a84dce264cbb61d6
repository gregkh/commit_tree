perf tools: Add missing initialization of perf_sample.cpumode in synthesized samples

In 473398a21d28 ("perf tools: Add cpumode to struct perf_sample"), I
missed some places where perf_sample fields are directly initialized in
addition to what is done in perf_evsel__parse_sample(), namely when
synthesizing PERF_RECORD_{MMAP*,COMM,FORK,EXIT} for pre-existing threads
and also in intel_pt and intel_bts when synthesizing events from
processor trace, the jitdump code also was affected, fix it.

The problem was noticed with running:

  # perf record -e intel_pt//u true
  # perf script

Where the samples wouldn't get resolved because perf_sample.cpumode
would be left as zero, i.e. PERF_RECORD_MISC_CPUMODE_UNKNOWN, not
resolving as kernel, hypervisor or user cpu modes.
