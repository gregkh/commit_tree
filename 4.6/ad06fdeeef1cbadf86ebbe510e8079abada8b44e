pwm: fsl-ftm: Use flat regmap cache

Use flat regmap cache to avoid lockdep warning at probe:

[    0.697285] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:2755 lockdep_trace_alloc+0x15c/0x160()
[    0.697449] DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(irqs_disabled_flags(flags))

The RB-tree regmap cache needs to allocate new space on first writes.
However, allocations in an atomic context (e.g. when a spinlock is held)
are not allowed. The function regmap_write calls map->lock, which
acquires a spinlock in the fast_io case. Since the pwm-fsl-ftm driver
uses MMIO, the regmap bus of type regmap_mmio is being used which has
fast_io set to true.

The MMIO space of the pwm-fsl-ftm driver is reasonable condense, hence
using the much faster flat regmap cache is anyway the better choice.
