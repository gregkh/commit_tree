pwm: omap-dmtimer: Round load and match values rather than truncate

When converting period and duty_cycle from nanoseconds to fclk cycles,
the error introduced by the integer division can be appreciable, especially
in the case of slow fclk or short period. Use DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL() so
that the error is kept to +/- 0.5 clock cycles.
