svcrdma: Hook up the logic to return ERR_CHUNK

RFC 5666 Section 4.2 states:

> When the peer detects an RPC-over-RDMA header version that it does
> not support (currently this document defines only version 1), it
> replies with an error code of ERR_VERS, and provides the low and
> high inclusive version numbers it does, in fact, support.

And:

> When other decoding errors are detected in the header or chunks,
> either an RPC decode error MAY be returned or the RPC/RDMA error
> code ERR_CHUNK MUST be returned.

The Linux NFS server does throw ERR_VERS when a client sends it
a request whose rdma_version is not "one." But it does not return
ERR_CHUNK when a header decoding error occurs. It just drops the
request.

To improve protocol extensibility, it should reject invalid values
in the rdma_proc field instead of treating them all like RDMA_MSG.
Otherwise clients can't detect when the server doesn't support
new rdma_proc values.
