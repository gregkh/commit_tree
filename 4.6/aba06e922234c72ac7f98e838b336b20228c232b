serial: samsung: optimize UART rx fifo access routine

This patch optimizes UART rx fifo access routine by reading UART SFR
when necessary. At first, the "fifocnt" variable will be initialized
as Rx FIFO count. So we don't need to access UFSTAT(FIFO status) register
every time to check FIFO count because we know that count with "fifocnt".
After all data were read out from Rx FIFO, the "fifocnt" will be set as 0.
Lastly, UFSTAT will be accessed again to check whether the data remains
by any chance.
