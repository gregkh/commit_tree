spi: omap2-mcspi: Undo broken fix for dma transfer of vmalloced buffer

This reverts commit 3525e0aac91c4de5d20b1f22a6c6e2b39db3cc96.

The DMA transfer for RX buffer was not handled correctly in this change.

The actual transfer length for DMA RX can be less than xfer->len in the
specific condition and the last words will be filled after the DMA
completion, but the commit doesn't consider it and the dmaengine is
started with rx_sg mapped by spi core.

The solution for this at least requires more lines than this commit
has inserted.  So revert it for now.
