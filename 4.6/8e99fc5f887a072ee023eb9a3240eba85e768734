stmmac: do not poll phy handler when attach a switch

This patch avoids to call the stmmac_adjust_link when
the driver is connected to a switch by using the FIXED_PHY
support. Prior this patch the phydev->irq was set as PHY_POLL
so periodically the phy handler was invoked spending useless
time because the link cannot actually change.
Note that the stmmac_adjust_link will be called just one
time and this guarantees that the ST glue logic will be
setup according to the mode and speed fixed.
