Input: pmic8xxx-pwrkey - fix algorithm for converting trigger delay

The trigger delay algorithm that converts from microseconds to
the register value looks incorrect. According to most of the PMIC
documentation, the equation is

	delay (Seconds) = (1 / 1024) * 2 ^ (x + 4)

except for one case where the documentation looks to have a
formatting issue and the equation looks like

	delay (Seconds) = (1 / 1024) * 2 x + 4

Most likely this driver was written with the improper
documentation to begin with. According to the downstream sources
the valid delays are from 2 seconds to 1/64 second, and the
latter equation just doesn't make sense for that. Let's fix the
algorithm and the range check to match the documentation and the
downstream sources.
