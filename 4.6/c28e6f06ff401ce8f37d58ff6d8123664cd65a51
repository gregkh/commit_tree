ath10k: fix sanity check on enabling btcoex via debugfs

First check for the device state before enabling / disabling
btcoex, also return a proper error value. Enabling / disabling
btcoex ideally does a f/w + ath10k_core_restart so the checks
that are applicable for 'simulate_fw_crash' shall be applicable
for this as well
