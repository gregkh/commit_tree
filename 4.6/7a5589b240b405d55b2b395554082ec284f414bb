virtio_pci: Use the DMA API if enabled

This switches to vring_create_virtqueue, simplifying the driver and
adding DMA API support.

This fixes virtio-pci on platforms and busses that have IOMMUs.  This
will break the experimental QEMU Q35 IOMMU support until QEMU is
fixed.  In exchange, it fixes physical virtio hardware as well as
virtio-pci running under Xen.
