ASoC: rsnd: Parent SSI attach is not needed if not clock master

Parent SSI is needed if it is PIN sharing and clock master,
otherwise, not needed. But, whether clockk master is judged on
.set_fmt, thus, it can't call rsnd_ssi_parent_attach() on .probe.

Now, .pcm_new will be called after .set_fmt, so this patch reuses it
at this point.
