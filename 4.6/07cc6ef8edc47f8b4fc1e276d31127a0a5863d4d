bcache: fix race of writeback thread starting before complete initialization

The bch_writeback_thread might BUG_ON in read_dirty() if
dc->sb==BDEV_STATE_DIRTY and bch_sectors_dirty_init has not yet completed
its related initialization.  This patch downs the dc->writeback_lock until
after initialization is complete, thus preventing bch_writeback_thread
from proceeding prematurely.
