ARM: 8532/1: uncompress: mark putc as inline

When CONFIG_DEBUG_ICEDCC is set, we don't use the platform
specific putc() function, but use icedcc_putc() instead, so
putc is unused and causes a compile time warning:

In file included from ../arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:28:0:
arch/arm/mach-rpc/include/mach/uncompress.h:79:13: warning: 'putc' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
arch/arm/mach-w90x900/include/mach/uncompress.h:30:13: warning: 'putc' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

On most platforms, this does not happen, because putc is defined
as 'static inline' so the compiler will automatically drop it
when it's unused.

This changes the remaining seven platforms to behave the same way.
