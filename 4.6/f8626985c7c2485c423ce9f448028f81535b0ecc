KVM: PPC: Account TCE-containing pages in locked_vm

At the moment pages used for TCE tables (in addition to pages addressed
by TCEs) are not counted in locked_vm counter so a malicious userspace
tool can call ioctl(KVM_CREATE_SPAPR_TCE) as many times as
RLIMIT_NOFILE and lock a lot of memory.

This adds counting for pages used for TCE tables.

This counts the number of pages required for a table plus pages for
the kvmppc_spapr_tce_table struct (TCE table descriptor) itself.

This changes release_spapr_tce_table() to store @npages on stack to
avoid calling kvmppc_stt_npages() in the loop (tiny optimization,
probably).

This does not change the amount of used memory.
