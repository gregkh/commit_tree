hrtimer: Catch illegal clockids

It is way too easy to take any random clockid and feed it to
the hrtimer subsystem. At best, it gets mapped to a monotonic
base, but it would be better to just catch illegal values as
early as possible.

This patch does exactly that, mapping illegal clockids to an
illegal base index, and panicing when we detect the illegal
condition.
