drm/i915: Consolidate unclaimed mmio detection

Access the unclaimed reg detection register through
one helper which also does cleanup. Note that we now access
the register only if the platform has the actual non claimed
access bit. This prevents reading the register with gens that
doesn't have the register or the unclaimed bit,
when debug_mmio > 0.

Note that we post after clearing the bit. This makes sure
that the next unclaimed write access would get detected
also if it happened right after clearing, and not fold
into the previous detection.
