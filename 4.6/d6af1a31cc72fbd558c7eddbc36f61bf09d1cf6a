vti: Add pmtu handling to vti_xmit.

We currently rely on the PMTU discovery of xfrm.
However if a packet is locally sent, the PMTU mechanism
of xfrm tries to do local socket notification what
might not work for applications like ping that don't
check for this. So add pmtu handling to vti_xmit to
report MTU changes immediately.
