xfs: cull unnecessary icdinode fields

Now that the struct xfs_icdinode is not directly related to the
on-disk format, we can cull things in it we really don't need to
store:

	- magic number never changes
	- padding is not necessary
	- next_unlinked is never used
	- inode number is redundant
	- uuid is redundant
	- lsn is accessed directly from dinode
	- inode CRC is only accessed directly from dinode

Hence we can remove these from the struct xfs_icdinode and redirect
the code that uses them to the xfs_dinode appripriately.  This
reduces the size of the struct icdinode from 152 bytes to 88 bytes,
and removes a fair chunk of unnecessary code, too.
