virtio_net: add ethtool support for set and get of settings

This patch allows the user to set and retrieve speed and duplex of the
virtio_net device via ethtool. Having this functionality is very helpful
for simulating different environments and also enables the virtio_net
device to participate in operations where proper speed and duplex are
required (e.g. currently bonding lacp mode requires full duplex). Custom
speed and duplex are not allowed, the user-supplied settings are validated
before applying.

Example:
$ ethtool eth1
Settings for eth1:
...
	Speed: Unknown!
	Duplex: Unknown! (255)
$ ethtool -s eth1 speed 1000 duplex full
$ ethtool eth1
Settings for eth1:
...
	Speed: 1000Mb/s
	Duplex: Full
