tty: Fix GPF in flush_to_ldisc(), part 2

commit 9ce119f318ba ("tty: Fix GPF in flush_to_ldisc()") fixed a
GPF caused by a line discipline which does not define a receive_buf()
method.

However, the vt driver (and speakup driver also) pushes selection
data directly to the line discipline receive_buf() method via
tty_ldisc_receive_buf(). Fix the same problem in tty_ldisc_receive_buf().
