ncr5380: Call scsi_eh_prep_cmnd() and scsi_eh_restore_cmnd() as and when appropriate

This bug causes the wrong command to have its sense pointer overwritten,
which sometimes leads to a NULL pointer deref. Fix this by checking which
command is being requeued before restoring the scsi_eh_save data.

It turns out that some targets will disconnect a REQUEST SENSE command.
The autosense algorithm doesn't anticipate this. Hence multiple commands
can end up undergoing autosense simultaneously, and they will all try to
use the same scsi_eh_save struct, which won't work. Defer autosense when
the scsi_eh_save storage is in use by another command.
