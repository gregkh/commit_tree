spi: imx: drop fallback to PIO

At the moment the driver decides to fallback to PIO mode the buffers
are already mapped for DMA. It's a bug to access them with the CPU
afterwards, so we cannot just fallback to PIO mode.
It should not be necessary anyway, since we only use DMA when we
verified that it's possible in the fist place, so when prep_slave_sg
fails it's a bug, either in the SDMA driver or in the can_dma
implementation.
