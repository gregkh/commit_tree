vfs: pass a flags argument to vfs_readv/vfs_writev

This way we can set kiocb flags also from the sync read/write path for
the read_iter/write_iter operations.  For now there is no way to pass
flags to plain read/write operations as there is no real need for that,
and all flags passed are explicitly rejected for these files.
