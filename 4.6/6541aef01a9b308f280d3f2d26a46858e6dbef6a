cpufreq: Drop unnecessary checks from show() and store()

The show() and store() routines in the cpufreq core don't need to
check if the struct freq_attr they want to use really provides the
callbacks they need as expected (if that's not the case, it means
a bug in the code anyway), so change them to avoid doing that.
