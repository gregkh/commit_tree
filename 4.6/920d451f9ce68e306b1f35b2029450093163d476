lkdtm: Add read/write after free tests for buddy memory

The current tests for read/write after free work on slab
allocated memory. Memory straight from the buddy allocator
may behave slightly differently and have a different set
of parameters to test. Add tests for those cases as well.

On a basic x86 boot:

 # echo WRITE_BUDDY_AFTER_FREE > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
[   22.291950] lkdtm: Performing direct entry WRITE_BUDDY_AFTER_FREE
[   22.292983] lkdtm: Writing to the buddy page before free
[   22.293950] lkdtm: Attempting bad write to the buddy page after free

 # echo READ_BUDDY_AFTER_FREE > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
[   32.375601] lkdtm: Performing direct entry READ_BUDDY_AFTER_FREE
[   32.379896] lkdtm: Value in memory before free: 12345678
[   32.383854] lkdtm: Attempting to read from freed memory
[   32.389309] lkdtm: Buddy page was not poisoned

On x86 with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and debug_pagealloc=on:

 # echo WRITE_BUDDY_AFTER_FREE > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
[   17.475533] lkdtm: Performing direct entry WRITE_BUDDY_AFTER_FREE
[   17.477360] lkdtm: Writing to the buddy page before free
[   17.479089] lkdtm: Attempting bad write to the buddy page after free
[   17.480904] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at
ffff88000ebd8000

 # echo READ_BUDDY_AFTER_FREE > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
[   14.606433] lkdtm: Performing direct entry READ_BUDDY_AFTER_FREE
[   14.607447] lkdtm: Value in memory before free: 12345678
[   14.608161] lkdtm: Attempting to read from freed memory
[   14.608860] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at
ffff88000eba3000

Note that arches without ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC may not
produce the same crash.
