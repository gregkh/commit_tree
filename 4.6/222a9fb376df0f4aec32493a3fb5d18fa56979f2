aacraid: Created new mutex for ioctl path

aac_mutex was used to create protect the ioctl path for only the compat
path, it would be make more sense to place mutex in aac_do_ioctl, which
is the main ioctl function call that handles all ioctl commands.

Created new mutex ioctl_mutex in struct aac_dev to protect switch case
in aac_do_ioctl and removed aac_mutex from aac_cfg_ioctl and
aac_compat_do_ioctl
