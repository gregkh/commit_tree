igb: Unpair the queues when changing the number of queues

By the commit 72ddef0506da ("igb: Fix oops caused by missing queue
pairing"), the IGB_FLAG_QUEUE_PAIRS flag can now be set when changing the
number of queues by "ethtool -L", but it is never cleared unless the igb
driver is reloaded.
This patch clears it if queue pairing becomes unnecessary as a result of
"ethtool -L".
