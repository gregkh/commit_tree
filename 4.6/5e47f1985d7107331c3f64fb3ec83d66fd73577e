target: Fix target_release_cmd_kref shutdown comp leak

This patch fixes an active I/O shutdown bug for fabric
drivers using target_wait_for_sess_cmds(), where se_cmd
descriptor shutdown would result in hung tasks waiting
indefinitely for se_cmd->cmd_wait_comp to complete().

To address this bug, drop the incorrect list_del_init()
usage in target_wait_for_sess_cmds() and always complete()
during se_cmd target_release_cmd_kref() put, in order to
let caller invoke the final fabric release callback
into se_cmd->se_tfo->release_cmd() code.
