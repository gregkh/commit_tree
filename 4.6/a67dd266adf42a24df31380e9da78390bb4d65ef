netfilter: xtables: prepare for on-demand hook register

This change prepares for upcoming on-demand xtables hook registration.

We change the protoypes of the register/unregister functions.
A followup patch will then add nf_hook_register/unregister calls
to the iptables one.

Once a hook is registered packets will be picked up, so all assignments
of the form

net->ipv4.iptable_$table = new_table

have to be moved to ip(6)t_register_table, else we can see NULL
net->ipv4.iptable_$table later.

This patch doesn't change functionality; without this the actual change
simply gets too big.
