xfs: remove timestamps from incore inode

The struct xfs_inode has two copies of the current timestamps in it,
one in the vfs inode and one in the struct xfs_icdinode. Now that we
no longer log the struct xfs_icdinode directly, we don't need to
keep the timestamps in this structure. instead we can copy them
straight out of the VFS inode when formatting the inode log item or
the on-disk inode.

This reduces the struct xfs_inode in size by 24 bytes.
