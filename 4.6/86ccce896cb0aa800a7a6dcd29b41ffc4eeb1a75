arm64: unmap idmap earlier

During boot we leave the idmap in place until paging_init, as we
previously had to wait for the zero page to become allocated and
accessible.

Now that we have a statically-allocated zero page, we can uninstall the
idmap much earlier in the boot process, making it far easier to spot
accidental use of physical addresses. This also brings the cold boot
path in line with the secondary boot path.
