powerpc: atomic: Implement acquire/release/relaxed variants for xchg

Implement xchg{,64}_relaxed and atomic{,64}_xchg_relaxed, based on these
_relaxed variants, release/acquire variants and fully ordered versions
can be built.

Note that xchg{,64}_relaxed and atomic_{,64}_xchg_relaxed are not
compiler barriers.
