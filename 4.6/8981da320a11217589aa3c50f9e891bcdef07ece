Drivers: hv: vmbus: add a hvsock flag in struct hv_driver

Only the coming hv_sock driver has a "true" value for this flag.

We treat the hvsock offers/channels as special VMBus devices.
Since the hv_sock driver handles all the hvsock offers/channels, we need to
tweak vmbus_match() for hv_sock driver, so we introduce this flag.
