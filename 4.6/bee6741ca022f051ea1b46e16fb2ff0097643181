tty, n_tty: Remove fasync() ldisc notification

Only the N_TTY line discipline implements the signal-driven i/o
notification enabled/disabled by fcntl(F_SETFL, O_ASYNC). The ldisc
fasync() notification is sent to the ldisc when the enable state has
changed (the tty core is notified via the fasync() VFS file operation).

The N_TTY line discipline used the enable state to change the wakeup
condition (minimum_to_wake = 1) for notifying the signal handler i/o is
available. However, just the presence of data is sufficient and necessary
to signal i/o is available, so changing minimum_to_wake is unnecessary
(and creates a race condition with read() and poll() which may be
concurrently updating minimum_to_wake).

Furthermore, since the kill_fasync() VFS helper performs no action if
the fasync list is empty, calling unconditionally is preferred; if
signal driven i/o just has been disabled, no signal will be sent by
kill_fasync() anyway so notification of the change via the ldisc
fasync() method is superfluous.
