PM / Domains: Propagate start and restore errors during runtime resume

During runtime resume the return values of the start and restore steps
are ignored. As a result drivers are not notified of runtime resume
failures and can't propagate them up. Fix it by returning an error if
either the start or restore step fails, and clean up properly in the
error path.
