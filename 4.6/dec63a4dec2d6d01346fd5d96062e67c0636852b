paride: make 'verbose' parameter an 'int' again

gcc-6.0 found an ancient bug in the paride driver, which had a
"module_param(verbose, bool, 0);" since before 2.6.12, but actually uses
it to accept '0', '1' or '2' as arguments:

  drivers/block/paride/pd.c: In function 'pd_init_dev_parms':
  drivers/block/paride/pd.c:298:29: warning: comparison of constant '1' with boolean expression is always false [-Wbool-compare]
   #define DBMSG(msg) ((verbose>1)?(msg):NULL)

In 2012, Rusty did a cleanup patch that also changed the type of the
variable to 'bool', which introduced what is now a gcc warning.

This changes the type back to 'int' and adapts the module_param() line
instead, so it should work as documented in case anyone ever cares about
running the ancient driver with debugging.
