Btrfs: fix truncate_space_check

truncate_space_check is using btrfs_csum_bytes_to_leaves() but forgetting to
multiply by nodesize so we get an actual byte count.  We need a tracepoint here
so that we have the matching reserve for the release that will come later.  Also
add a comment to make clear what the intent of truncate_space_check is.
