Btrfs: btrfs_submit_direct_hook: Handle map_length < bio vector length

In subpagesize-blocksize scenario, map_length can be less than the length of a
bio vector. Such a condition may cause btrfs_submit_direct_hook() to submit a
zero length bio. Fix this by comparing map_length against block size rather
than with bv_len.
