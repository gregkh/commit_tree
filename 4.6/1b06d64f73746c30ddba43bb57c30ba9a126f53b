gpio: Add GPIO support for the ACCES 104-DIO-48E

The ACCES 104-DIO-48E device provides 48 lines digital I/O via two
Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI) chips of type 82C55. Bit C3 at
each 24-bit Group can be used as an external interrupt, triggered by a
rising edge.

This driver provides GPIO and IRQ support for these 48 channels of
digital I/O. The base port address for the device may be configured via
the dio_48e_base module parameter. The interrupt line number for the
device may be configured via the dio_48e_irq module parameter.
