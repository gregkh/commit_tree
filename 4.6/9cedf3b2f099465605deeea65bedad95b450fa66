i2c: qup: Add bam dma capabilities

QUP cores can be attached to a BAM module, which acts as
a dma engine for the QUP core. When DMA with BAM is enabled,
the BAM consumer pipe transmitted data is written to the
output FIFO and the BAM producer pipe received data is read
from the input FIFO.

With BAM capabilities, qup-i2c core can transfer more than
256 bytes, without a 'stop' which is not possible otherwise.
