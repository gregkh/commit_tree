arm64: KVM: Add access handler for PMOVSSET and PMOVSCLR register

Since the reset value of PMOVSSET and PMOVSCLR is UNKNOWN, use
reset_unknown for its reset handler. Add a handler to emulate writing
PMOVSSET or PMOVSCLR register.

When writing non-zero value to PMOVSSET, the counter and its interrupt
is enabled, kick this vcpu to sync PMU interrupt.
