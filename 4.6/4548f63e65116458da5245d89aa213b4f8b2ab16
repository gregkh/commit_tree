x86/kvm: Add stack frame dependency to fastop() inline asm

The kbuild test robot reported this objtool warning [1]:

  arch/x86/kvm/emulate.o: warning: objtool: fastop()+0x69: call without frame pointer save/setup

The issue seems to be caused by CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES.  With that
option, for some reason gcc decides not to create a stack frame in
fastop() before doing the inline asm call, which can result in a bad
stack trace.

Force a stack frame to be created if CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is enabled by
listing the stack pointer as an output operand for the inline asm
statement.

This change has no effect for !CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES.
