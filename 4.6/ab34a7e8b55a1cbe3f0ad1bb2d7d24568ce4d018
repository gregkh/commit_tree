drm/i915/fbc: replace frequent dev_priv->fbc.x with fbc->x

We say "dev_priv->fbc.something" way too many times in our code while
we could be saying just "fbc->something" with a previous declaration
of fbc. This has been bothering me for a while but I didn't want to
patch it since I wanted to fix the real problems first. But as I add
more code I keep thinking about it, especially since it makes the code
easier to read and it can make us fit 80 columns easier, so let's just
do the change now.

While at it, also rename from i915_fbc to intel_fbc because the whole
FBC code uses intel_fbc.

v2: Rebase after the work_fn changes.
