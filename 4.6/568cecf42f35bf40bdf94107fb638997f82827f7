ASoC: qcom: fix build error

While building m32r allmodconfig the build failed with:
ERROR: "bad_dma_ops" [sound/soc/qcom/snd-soc-lpass-platform.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "dma_common_mmap" [sound/soc/qcom/snd-soc-lpass-platform.ko] undefined!

To satisfy the dependency CONFIG_SND_SOC_LPASS_PLATFORM should depend
on HAS_DMA.
Some other configs also needs the dependency on HAS_DMA as they are
directly or indirectly selecting SND_SOC_LPASS_PLATFORM.
