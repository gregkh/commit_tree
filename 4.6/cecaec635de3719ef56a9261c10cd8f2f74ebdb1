perf tools: Update srcline/file if needed

Normally the hist entry's srcline and/or srcfile is set during sorting.
However sometime it's possible to a hist entry's srcline is not set yet
after the sorting.  This is because the entry is so unique and other
sort keys already make it distinct.  Then the srcline/file sort didn't
have a chance to be called during the sorting.  In that case it has NULL
srcline/srcfile field and shows nothing.

Before:

  $ perf report -s comm,sym,srcline
  ...
