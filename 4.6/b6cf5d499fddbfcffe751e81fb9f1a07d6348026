batman-adv: B.A.T.M.A.N V - make sure iface is reactivated upon NETDEV_UP event

At the moment there is no explicit reactivation of an hard-interface
upon NETDEV_UP event. In case of B.A.T.M.A.N. IV the interface is
reactivated as soon as the next OGM is scheduled for sending, but this
mechanism does not work with B.A.T.M.A.N. V. The latter does not rely
on the same scheduling mechanism as its predecessor and for this reason
the hard-interface remains deactivated forever after being brought down
once.

This patch fixes the reactivation mechanism by adding a new routing API
which explicitly allows each algorithm to perform any needed operation
upon interface re-activation.

Such API is optional and is implemented by B.A.T.M.A.N. V only and it
just takes care of setting the iface status to ACTIVE
