drm: Create drm_send_event helpers

Use them in the core vblank code and exynos/vmwgfx drivers.

Note that the difference between wake_up_all and _interruptible in
vmwgfx doesn't matter since the only waiter is the core code in
drm_fops.c. And that is interruptible.

v2: Adjust existing kerneldoc too.
