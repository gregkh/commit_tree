RDS: Drop stale iWARP RDMA transport

RDS iWarp support code has become stale and non testable. As
indicated earlier, am dropping the support for it.

If new iWarp user(s) shows up in future, we can adapat the RDS IB
transprt for the special RDMA READ sink case. iWarp needs an MR
for the RDMA READ sink.
