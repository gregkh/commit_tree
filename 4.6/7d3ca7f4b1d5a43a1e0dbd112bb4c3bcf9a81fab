iwlwifi: mvm: adapt the firmware assert log to new firmware

Newer firmware versions put different data in the memory
which is read by the driver upon firmware crash. Just
change the variable names in the code and the name of the
data in the log that we print withouth any functional
change.
On older firmware, there will be a mismatch between the
names that are printed and the content itself, but that's
harmless.
