x86/PCI: Mark Broadwell-EP Home Agent & PCU as having non-compliant BARs

The Home Agent and PCU PCI devices in Broadwell-EP have a non-BAR register
where a BAR should be.  We don't know what the side effects of sizing the
"BAR" would be, and we don't know what address space the "BAR" might appear
to describe.

Mark these devices as having non-compliant BARs so the PCI core doesn't
touch them.
