tty: audit: Remove false memory optimization

The tty audit buffer is allocated at first use and not freed until
the process exits. If tty audit is turned off after the audit buffer
has been allocated, no effort is made to release the buffer.
So re-checking if tty audit has just been turned off when tty audit
was just on is false optimization; the likelihood of triggering this
condition is exceedingly small.
