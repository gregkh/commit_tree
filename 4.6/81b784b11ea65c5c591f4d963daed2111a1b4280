Orangefs: Swap order of include files

spinlock_types.h requires types from linux/types.h.
Including spinlock_types.h first may result in the following build errors,
as seen with arm:allmodconfig.

arch/arm/include/asm/spinlock_types.h:12:3: error: unknown type name 'u32'
arch/arm/include/asm/spinlock_types.h:16:4: error: unknown type name 'u16'
