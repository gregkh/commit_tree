PCI: Restore inclusion of pci/hotplug Kconfig

Commit e7e127e3c767 ("PCI: Include pci/hotplug Kconfig directly from
pci/Kconfig") added one line to pci/Kconfig.  However, for some mysterious
reason it isn't there now, even though there are no traces of removing it
in the git log.

I detected this issue when 'make oldconfig' removed all the options that
depended on HOTPLUG_PCI.

[bhelgaas: I botched the cfeb8139a1fb ("Merge branch 'pci/host-hv' into
next") merge.  "git diff cfeb8139a1fb^ cfeb8139a1fb" shows a conflict in
drivers/pci/Kconfig, and I mistakenly dropped the hotplug/Kconfig piece.]
