perf jitdump: DWARF is also needed

While building on a Docker container for ubuntu and installing package
by package one ends up with:

    MKDIR    /tmp/build/util/
    CC       /tmp/build/util/genelf.o
  util/genelf.c:22:19: fatal error: dwarf.h: No such file or directory
   #include <dwarf.h>
                   ^
  compilation terminated.
  mv: cannot stat '/tmp/build/util/.genelf.o.tmp': No such file or directory

Because the jitdump code needs the DWARF related development packages to
be installed. So make it dependent on that so that the build can succeed
without jitdump support.
