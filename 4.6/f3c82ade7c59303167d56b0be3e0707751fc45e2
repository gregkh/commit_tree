tpm: fix checks for policy digest existence in tpm2_seal_trusted()

In my original patch sealing with policy was done with dynamically
allocated buffer that I changed later into an array so the checks in
tpm2-cmd.c became invalid. This patch fixes the issue.

Fixes: 5beb0c435bdd ("keys, trusted: seal with a TPM2 authorization policy")
