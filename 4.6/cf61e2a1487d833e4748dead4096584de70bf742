memremap: don't modify flags

These patches implement a MEMREMAP_WC flag for memremap(), which can be
used to obtain writecombine mappings.  This is then used for setting up
dma_coherent_mem regions which use the DMA_MEMORY_MAP flag.

The motivation is to fix an alignment fault on arm64, and the suggestion
to implement MEMREMAP_WC for this case was made at [1].  That particular
issue is handled in patch 4, which makes sure that the appropriate
memset function is used when zeroing allocations mapped as IO memory.

This patch (of 4):

Don't modify the flags input argument to memremap(). MEMREMAP_WB is
already a special case so we can check for it directly instead of
clearing flag bits in each mapper.
