nvme: Log the ctrl device name instead of the underlying pci device name

Having the ctrl name "nvmeX" seems much more friendly than
the underlying device name. Also, with other nvme transports
such as the soon to come nvme-loop we don't have an underlying
device so it doesn't makes sense to make up one.

In order to help matching an instance name to a pci function,
we add a info print in nvme_probe.
