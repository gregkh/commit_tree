IB/qib: Remove most uses of QIB_PERMISSIVE_LID and QIB_MULTICAST_LID_BASE

This patch removes most of the uses of QIB_PERMISSIBVE_LID and
QIB_MULTICAST_LID_BASE in favor of the recently added IB_* versions.
There are still minor uses in AH functions as well as the QIB_* defines
but those will be removed in a follow on patch.
