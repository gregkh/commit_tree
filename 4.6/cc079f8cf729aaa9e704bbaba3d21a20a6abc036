drivers/acpi: make bgrt driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this driver is currently:

config ACPI_BGRT
    bool "Boottime Graphics Resource Table support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove all modular references, so that when reading the driver
there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
