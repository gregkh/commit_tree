drm/i915: Use ordered seqno write interrupt generation on gen8+ execlists

Broadwell and later currently use the same unordered command sequence to
update the seqno in the HWS status page and then assert the user
interrupt. We should apply the w/a from legacy (where we do an mmio
read to delay the seqno read after the interrupt), but this is not
enough to enforce coherent seqno visibilty on Skylake. Rather than
search for the proper post-interrupt seqno barrier, use a strongly
ordered command sequence to write the seqno, then assert the user
interrupt from the ring.

v2: Move around the wa tail dwords to avoid adding duplicate code.

v3: Add references, comments on workarounds and bit5 check.
