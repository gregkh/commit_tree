mm, vmscan: make zone_reclaimable_pages more precise

zone_reclaimable_pages() is used in should_reclaim_retry() which uses it
to calculate the target for the watermark check.  This means that
precise numbers are important for the correct decision.
zone_reclaimable_pages uses zone_page_state which can contain stale data
with per-cpu diffs not synced yet (the last vmstat_update might have run
1s in the past).

Use zone_page_state_snapshot() in zone_reclaimable_pages() instead.
None of the current callers is in a hot path where getting the precise
value (which involves per-cpu iteration) would cause an unreasonable
overhead.
