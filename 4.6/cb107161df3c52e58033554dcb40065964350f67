Convert straggling drivers to new six-argument get_user_pages()

Commit d4edcf0d5695 ("mm/gup: Switch all callers of get_user_pages() to
not pass tsk/mm") switched get_user_pages() callers to the simpler model
where they no longer pass in the thread and mm pointer.  But since then
we've merged changes to a few drivers that re-introduce use of the old
interface.  Let's fix them up.

They continued to work fine (thanks to the truly disgusting macros
introduced in commit cde70140fed8: "mm/gup: Overload get_user_pages()
functions"), but cause unnecessary build noise.
