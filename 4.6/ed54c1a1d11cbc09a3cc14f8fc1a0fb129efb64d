drm/i915: abolish separate per-ring default_context pointers

Now that we've eliminated a lot of uses of ring->default_context,
we can eliminate the pointer itself.

All the engines share the same default intel_context, so we can just
keep a single reference to it in the dev_priv structure rather than one
in each of the engine[] elements. This make refcounting more sensible
too, as we now have a refcount of one for the one pointer, rather than
a refcount of one but multiple pointers.

From an idea by Chris Wilson.

v2:	transform an extra instance of ring->default_context introduced by
    42f1cae8c drm/i915: Restore inhibiting the load of the default context
    That patch's commentary includes:
	v2: Mark the global default context as uninitialized on GPU reset so
	    that the context-local workarounds are reloaded upon re-enabling
    The code implementing that now also benefits from the replacement of
    the multiple (per-ring) pointers to the default context with a single
    pointer to the unique kernel context.

v4:	Rebased, remove underused local (Nick Hoath)
