vfs: define a generic function to read a file from the kernel

For a while it was looked down upon to directly read files from Linux.
These days there exists a few mechanisms in the kernel that do just
this though to load a file into a local buffer.  There are minor but
important checks differences on each.  This patch set is the first
attempt at resolving some of these differences.

This patch introduces a common function for reading files from the kernel
with the corresponding security post-read hook and function.

Changelog v4+:
- export security_kernel_post_read_file() - Fengguang Wu
v3:
- additional bounds checking - Luis
v2:
- To simplify patch review, re-ordered patches
