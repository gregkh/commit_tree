packet: tpacket_snd gso and checksum offload

Support socket option PACKET_VNET_HDR together with PACKET_TX_RING.

When enabled, a struct virtio_net_hdr is expected to precede the data
in the ring. The vnet option must be set before the ring is created.

The implementation reuses the existing skb_copy_bits code that is used
when dev->hard_header_len is non-zero. Move this ll_header check to
before the skb alloc and combine it with a test for vnet_hdr->hdr_len.
Allocate and copy the max of the two.
