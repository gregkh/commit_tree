MIPS: traps: Correct the SIGTRAP debug ABI in `do_watch' and `do_trap_or_bp'

Follow our own rules set in <asm/siginfo.h> for SIGTRAP signals issued
from `do_watch' and `do_trap_or_bp' by setting the signal code to
TRAP_HWBKPT and TRAP_BRKPT respectively, for Watch exceptions and for
those Breakpoint exceptions whose originating BREAK instruction's code
does not have a special meaning.  Keep Trap exceptions unaffected as
these are not debug events.

No existing user software is expected to examine signal codes for these
signals as SI_KERNEL has been always used here.  This change makes the
MIPS port more like other Linux ports, which reduces the complexity and
provides for performance improvement in GDB.
