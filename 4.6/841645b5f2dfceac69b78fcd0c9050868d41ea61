ipv6: Revert optional address flusing on ifdown.

This reverts the following three commits:

70af921db6f8835f4b11c65731116560adb00c14
799977d9aafbf0ca0b9c39b04cbfb16db71302c9
f1705ec197e705b79ea40fe7a2cc5acfa1d3bfac

The feature was ill conceived, has terrible semantics, and has added
nothing but regressions to the already fragile ipv6 stack.

Fixes: f1705ec197e7 ("net: ipv6: Make address flushing on ifdown optional")
