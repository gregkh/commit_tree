usb: devio: Add ioctl to disallow detaching kernel USB drivers.

The new USBDEVFS_DROP_PRIVILEGES ioctl allows a process to voluntarily
relinquish the ability to issue other ioctls that may interfere with
other processes and drivers that have claimed an interface on the
device.

This commit also includes a simple utility to be able to test the
ioctl, located at Documentation/usb/usbdevfs-drop-permissions.c

Example (with qemu-kvm's input device):

    $ lsusb
    ...
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0627:0001 Adomax Technology Co., Ltd

    $ usb-devices
    ...
    C:  #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=a0 MxPwr=100mA
    I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=00 Prot=02 Driver=usbhid

    $ sudo ./usbdevfs-drop-permissions /dev/bus/usb/001/002
    OK: privileges dropped!
    Available options:
    [0] Exit now
    [1] Reset device. Should fail if device is in use
    [2] Claim 4 interfaces. Should succeed where not in use
    [3] Narrow interface permission mask
    Which option shall I run?: 1
    ERROR: USBDEVFS_RESET failed! (1 - Operation not permitted)
    Which test shall I run next?: 2
    ERROR claiming if 0 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    ERROR claiming if 1 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    ERROR claiming if 2 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    ERROR claiming if 3 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    Which test shall I run next?: 0

After unbinding usbhid:

    $ usb-devices
    ...
    I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=00 Prot=02 Driver=(none)

    $ sudo ./usbdevfs-drop-permissions /dev/bus/usb/001/002
    ...
    Which option shall I run?: 2
    OK: claimed if 0
    ERROR claiming if 1 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    ERROR claiming if 2 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    ERROR claiming if 3 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    Which test shall I run next?: 1
    OK: USBDEVFS_RESET succeeded
    Which test shall I run next?: 0

After unbinding usbhid and restricting the mask:

    $ sudo ./usbdevfs-drop-permissions /dev/bus/usb/001/002
    ...
    Which option shall I run?: 3
    Insert new mask: 0
    OK: privileges dropped!
    Which test shall I run next?: 2
    ERROR claiming if 0 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    ERROR claiming if 1 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    ERROR claiming if 2 (1 - Operation not permitted)
    ERROR claiming if 3 (1 - Operation not permitted)
