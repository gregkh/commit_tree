watchdog: don't run proc_watchdog_update if new value is same as old

While working on a script to restore all sysctl params before a series of
tests I found that writing any value into the
/proc/sys/kernel/{nmi_watchdog,soft_watchdog,watchdog,watchdog_thresh}
causes them to call proc_watchdog_update().

  NMI watchdog: enabled on all CPUs, permanently consumes one hw-PMU counter.
  NMI watchdog: enabled on all CPUs, permanently consumes one hw-PMU counter.
  NMI watchdog: enabled on all CPUs, permanently consumes one hw-PMU counter.

There doesn't appear to be a reason for doing this work every time a write
occurs, so only do it when the values change.
