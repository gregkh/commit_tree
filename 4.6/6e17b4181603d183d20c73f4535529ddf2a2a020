clk: sunxi: Add apb0 gates for H3

This patch adds support for APB0 in H3. It seems to be compatible with
earlier SOCs. apb0 gates controls R_ block peripherals (R_PIO, R_IR,
etc).

Since this gates behave just like any Allwinner clock gate, add a generic
compatible that can be reused if we don't have any clock to protect.
