ipv6: add option to drop unsolicited neighbor advertisements

In certain 802.11 wireless deployments, there will be NA proxies
that use knowledge of the network to correctly answer requests.
To prevent unsolicitd advertisements on the shared medium from
being a problem, on such deployments wireless needs to drop them.

Enable this by providing an option called "drop_unsolicited_na".
