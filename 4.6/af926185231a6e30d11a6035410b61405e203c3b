cpufreq: governor: Put governor structure into common_dbs_data

For the ondemand and conservative governors (generally, governors
that use the common code in cpufreq_governor.c), there are two static
data structures representing the governor, the struct governor
structure (the interface to the cpufreq core) and the struct
common_dbs_data one (the interface to the cpufreq_governor.c code).

There's no fundamental reason why those two structures have to be
separate.  Moreover, if the struct governor one is included into
struct common_dbs_data, it will be possible to reach the latter from
the policy via its policy->governor pointer, so it won't be necessary
to pass a separate pointer to it around.  For this reason, embed
struct governor in struct common_dbs_data.
