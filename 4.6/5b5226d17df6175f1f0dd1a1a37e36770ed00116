clk: sunxi: Make clocks setup functions take const pointer

All the data structure that we pass to the clocks setup functions are
declared const, while our setup functions expects a regular pointer. This
was hidden by the fact that we cast a void * pointer back to these
structures, which made it go unnoticed.

Fix the functions prototype.
