drm/i915: s/intel_gen4_compute_page_offset/intel_compute_tile_offset/

Since intel_gen4_compute_page_offset() can now handle tiling formats
all the way down to gen2, rename it to intel_compute_tile_offset().
Not that we actually use it on gen2/3 since there's no DSPSURF etc.
registers which would take a page aligned address.
