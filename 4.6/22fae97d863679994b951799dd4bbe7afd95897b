xen-netback: implement dynamic multicast control

My recent patch to the Xen Project documents a protocol for 'dynamic
multicast control' in netif.h. This extends the previous multicast control
protocol to not require a shared ring reconnection to turn the feature off.
Instead the backend watches the "request-multicast-control" key in xenstore
and turns the feature off if the key value is written to zero.

This patch adds support for dynamic multicast control in xen-netback.
