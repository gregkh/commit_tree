GRE: Disable segmentation offloads w/ CSUM and we are encapsulated via FOU

This patch fixes an issue I found in which we were dropping frames if we
had enabled checksums on GRE headers that were encapsulated by either FOU
or GUE.  Without this patch I was barely able to get 1 Gb/s of throughput.
With this patch applied I am now at least getting around 6 Gb/s.

The issue is due to the fact that with FOU or GUE applied we do not provide
a transport offset pointing to the GRE header, nor do we offload it in
software as the GRE header is completely skipped by GSO and treated like a
VXLAN or GENEVE type header.  As such we need to prevent the stack from
generating it and also prevent GRE from generating it via any interface we
create.
