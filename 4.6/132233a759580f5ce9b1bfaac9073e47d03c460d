arm64: Drop alloc function from create_mapping

create_mapping is only used in fixmap_remap_fdt. All the create_mapping
calls need to happen on existing translation table pages without
additional allocations. Rather than have an alloc function be called
and fail, just set it to NULL and catch its use. Also change
the name to create_mapping_noalloc to better capture what exactly is
going on.
