watchdog: Introduce WDOG_HW_RUNNING flag

The WDOG_HW_RUNNING flag is expected to be set by watchdog drivers if
the hardware watchdog is running. If the flag is set, the watchdog
subsystem will ping the watchdog even if the watchdog device is closed.

The watchdog driver stop function is now optional and may be omitted
if the watchdog can not be stopped. If stopping the watchdog is not
possible but the driver implements a stop function, it is responsible
to set the WDOG_HW_RUNNING flag in its stop function.
