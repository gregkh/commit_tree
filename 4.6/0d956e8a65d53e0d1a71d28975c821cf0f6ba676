qed: Add support for HW attentions

HW is capable of generating attentnions for a multitude of reasons,
but current driver is enabling attention generation only for management
firmware [required for link notifications].

This patch enables almost all of the possible reasons for HW attentions,
logging the HW block generating the attention and preventing further
attentions from that source [to prevent possible attention flood].
It also lays the infrastructure for additional exploration of the various
attentions.
