x86/platform: Make platform/geode/geos.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

  arch/x86/Kconfig:config GEOS
  arch/x86/Kconfig:       bool "Traverse Technologies GEOS System Support (LEDS, GPIO, etc)"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity, so that when reading
the code there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
