drm/msm/dsi: Remove incorrect warning on host attach

With the implementation of of_graph parsing, it isn't any longer
necessary for msm_host->device node to be same as dsi->dev.of_node. This
only holds true when the connected device is also a child of the dsi_host.

In the case of external bridge chips belonging to a different control
bus, these are guaranteed to be different.
