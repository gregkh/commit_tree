tipc: remove pre-allocated message header in link struct

Until now, we have kept a pre-allocated protocol message header
aggregated into struct tipc_link. Apart from adding unnecessary
footprint to the link instances, this requires extra code both to
initialize and re-initialize it.

We now remove this sub-optimization. This change also makes it
possible to clean up the function tipc_build_proto_msg() and remove
a couple of small functions that were accessing the mentioned header.
In particular, we can replace all occurrences of the local function
call link_own_addr(link) with the generic tipc_own_addr(net).
