ocfs2: return the physical address in ocfs2_write_cluster

To support direct io in ocfs2_write_begin_nolock & ocfs2_write_end_nolock.

Direct io needs to get the physical address from write_begin, to map the
user page.  This patch is to change the arg 'phys' of
ocfs2_write_cluster to a pointer, so it can be retrieved to write_begin.
And we can retrieve it to the direct io procedure.
