rtc: rx8025: round up to nearest minute for a minute accuracy alarm

The alarm for rx8025 only has a minute accuracy, so round up to nearest
minute when setting alarm.  Without doing this, rtctest blocks one day
after setting alarm to 5 seconds later.

pcf8563 and hym8563 also have similar handling.
