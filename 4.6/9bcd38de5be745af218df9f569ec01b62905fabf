drm/nouveau/bo: consider DMA buffers on x86 only

The DMA API has different semantics on different architectures.
Currently on arm64, it can only provide memory from a small pool which
dries up quickly if we attempt to allocate big buffers from it.

Do not consider that option when running on non-x86, since regular TTM
buffers are the (current) best-fit for ARM platforms.
