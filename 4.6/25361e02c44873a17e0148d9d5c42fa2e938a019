IB/mlx5: Generate completions in software

The GSI QP emulation requires also emulating completions for transmitted
MADs. The CQ on which these completions are generated can also be used by
the hardware, and the MAD layer is free to use any CQ of the device for the
GSI QP.

Add a method for generating software completions to each mlx5 CQ. Software
completions are polled first, and generate calls to the completion handler
callback if necessary.
