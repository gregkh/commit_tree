orangefs: Remove useless inline qualifier from bufmap functions.

All callers were outside of the file these functions were declared in,
so nothing was ever inlined anyway.

Further this happens before I/O and any speedup by not having to do a
call will be dwarfed by the time it takes to talk to the server.
