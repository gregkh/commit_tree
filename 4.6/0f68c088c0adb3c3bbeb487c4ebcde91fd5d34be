x86/cpufeature: Create a new synthetic cpu capability for machine check recovery

The Intel Software Developer Manual describes bit 24 in the MCG_CAP
MSR:

   MCG_SER_P (software error recovery support present) flag,
   bit 24 â€” Indicates (when set) that the processor supports
   software error recovery

But only some models with this capability bit set will actually
generate recoverable machine checks.

Check the model name and set a synthetic capability bit. Provide
a command line option to set this bit anyway in case the kernel
doesn't recognise the model name.
