arm64: enable CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA by default

In spite of its name, CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA is an important hardening feature
for production kernels, and distros all enable it by default in their
kernel configs. However, since enabling it used to result in more granular,
and thus less efficient kernel mappings, it is not enabled by default for
performance reasons.

However, since commit 2f39b5f91eb4 ("arm64: mm: Mark .rodata as RO"), the
various kernel segments (.text, .rodata, .init and .data) are already
mapped individually, and the only effect of setting CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA is
that the existing .text and .rodata mappings are updated late in the boot
sequence to have their read-only attributes set, which means that any
performance concerns related to enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA are no longer
valid.

So from now on, make CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA default to 'y'
