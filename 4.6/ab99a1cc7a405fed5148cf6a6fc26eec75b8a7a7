KVM: s390: do not take mmap_sem on dirty log query

Dirty log query can take a long time for huge guests.
Holding the mmap_sem for very long times  can cause some unwanted
latencies.
Turns out that we do not need to hold the mmap semaphore.
We hold the slots_lock for gfn->hva translation and walk the page
tables with that address, so no need to look at the VMAs. KVM also
holds a reference to the mm, which should prevent other things
going away. During the walk we take the necessary ptl locks.
