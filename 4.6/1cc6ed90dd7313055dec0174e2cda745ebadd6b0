arm64: make mrs_s prefixing implicit in read_cpuid

Commit 0f54b14e76f5302a ("arm64: cpufeature: Change read_cpuid() to use
sysreg's mrs_s macro") changed read_cpuid to require a SYS_ prefix on
register names, to allow manual assembly of registers unknown by the
toolchain, using tables in sysreg.h.

This interacts poorly with commit 42b55734030c1f72 ("efi/arm64: Check
for h/w support before booting a >4 KB granular kernel"), which is
curretly queued via the tip tree, and uses read_cpuid without a SYS_
prefix. Due to this, a build of next-20160304 fails if EFI and 64K pages
are selected.

To avoid this issue when trees are merged, move the required SYS_
prefixing into read_cpuid, and revert all of the updated callsites to
pass plain register names. This effectively reverts the bulk of commit
0f54b14e76f5302a.
