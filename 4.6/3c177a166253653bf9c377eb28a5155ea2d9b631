pinctrl: single: Use a separate lockdep class

The single pinmux controller can be cascaded to the other interrupt
controllers. Hence when propagating wake-up settings to its parent
interrupt controller, there's possiblity of detecting possible recursive
locking and getting lockdep warning.

This patch avoids this false positive by using a separate lockdep class
for this single pinctrl interrupts.
