net: phy: at803x: only the AT8030 needs a hardware reset on link change

Commit 13a56b44 ("at803x: Add support for hardware reset") added a
work-around for a hardware bug on the AT8030.  However, the work-around
was being called for all 803x PHYs, even those that don't need it.
Function at803x_link_change_notify() checks to make sure that it only
resets the PHY on the 8030, but it makes more sense to not call that
function at all if it isn't needed.
