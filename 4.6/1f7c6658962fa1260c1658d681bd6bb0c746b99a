ALSA: hda - Fix unconditional GPIO toggle via automute

Cirrus HD-audio driver may adjust GPIO pins for EAPD dynamically
depending on the jack plug state.  This works fine for the auto-mute
mode where the speaker gets muted upon the HP jack plug.   OTOH, when
the auto-mute mode is off, this turns off the EAPD unexpectedly
depending on the jack state, which results in the silent speaker
output.

This patch fixes the silent speaker output issue by setting GPIO bits
constantly when the auto-mute mode is off.
