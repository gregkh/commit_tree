perf/x86/intel/rapl: Convert it to a per package facility

RAPL is a per package facility and we already have a mechanism for a dedicated
per package reader. So there is no point to have multiple CPUs doing the
same. The current implementation actually starts two timers on two CPUs if one
does:

	perf stat -C1,2 -e -e power/energy-pkg ....

which makes the whole concept of 1 reader per package moot.

What's worse is that the above returns the double of the actual energy
consumption, but that's a different problem to address and cannot be solved by
removing the pointless per cpuness of that mechanism.
