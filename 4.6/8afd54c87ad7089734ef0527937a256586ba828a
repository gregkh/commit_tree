bpf: add flags to bpf_skb_store_bytes for clearing hash

When overwriting parts of the packet with bpf_skb_store_bytes() that
were fed previously into skb->hash calculation, we should clear the
current hash with skb_clear_hash(), so that a next skb_get_hash() call
can determine the correct hash related to this skb.
