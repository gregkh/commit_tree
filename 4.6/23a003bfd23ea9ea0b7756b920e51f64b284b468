mm/madvise: pass return code of memory_failure() to userspace

Currently the return value of memory_failure() is not passed to
userspace when madvise(MADV_HWPOISON) is used.  This is inconvenient for
test programs that want to know the result of error handling.  So let's
return it to the caller as we already do in the MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE case.
