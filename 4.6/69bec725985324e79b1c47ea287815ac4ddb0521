USB: core: let USB device know device node

Although most of USB devices are hot-plug's, there are still some devices
are hard wired on the board, eg, for HSIC and SSIC interface USB devices.
If these kinds of USB devices are multiple functions, and they can supply
other interfaces like i2c, gpios for other devices, we may need to
describe these at device tree.

In this commit, it uses "reg" in dts as physical port number to match
the phyiscal port number decided by USB core, if they are the same,
then the device node is for the device we are creating for USB core.
