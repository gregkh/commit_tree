cred/userns: define current_user_ns() as a function

The current_user_ns() macro currently returns &init_user_ns when user
namespaces are disabled, and that causes several warnings when building
with gcc-6.0 in code that compares the result of the macro to
&init_user_ns itself:

  fs/xfs/xfs_ioctl.c: In function 'xfs_ioctl_setattr_check_projid':
  fs/xfs/xfs_ioctl.c:1249:22: error: self-comparison always evaluates to true [-Werror=tautological-compare]
    if (current_user_ns() == &init_user_ns)

This is a legitimate warning in principle, but here it isn't really
helpful, so I'm reprasing the definition in a way that shuts up the
warning.  Apparently gcc only warns when comparing identical literals,
but it can figure out that the result of an inline function can be
identical to a constant expression in order to optimize a condition yet
not warn about the fact that the condition is known at compile time.
This is exactly what we want here, and it looks reasonable because we
generally prefer inline functions over macros anyway.
