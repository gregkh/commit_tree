Revert "[media] tvp5150: Fix breakage for serial usage"

This patch were a workaround for a regression at tvp5150, but
it causes troubles on devices with omap3+tvp5151 when working
in non-parallel bus mode.

Now that em28xx was fixed, we can get rid of that.

This reverts commit 47de9bf8931e6bf9c92fdba9867925d1ce482ab1.
