cpufreq: Add mechanism for registering utilization update callbacks

Introduce a mechanism by which parts of the cpufreq subsystem
("setpolicy" drivers or the core) can register callbacks to be
executed from cpufreq_update_util() which is invoked by the
scheduler's update_load_avg() on CPU utilization changes.

This allows the "setpolicy" drivers to dispense with their timers
and do all of the computations they need and frequency/voltage
adjustments in the update_load_avg() code path, among other things.

The update_load_avg() changes were suggested by Peter Zijlstra.
