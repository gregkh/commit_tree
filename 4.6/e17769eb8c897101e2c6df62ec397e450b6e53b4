KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Send IPI to host core to wake VCPU

This patch adds support to real-mode KVM to search for a core
running in the host partition and send it an IPI message with
VCPU to be woken. This avoids having to switch to the host
partition to complete an H_IPI hypercall when the VCPU which
is the target of the the H_IPI is not loaded (is not running
in the guest).

The patch also includes the support in the IPI handler running
in the host to do the wakeup by calling kvmppc_xics_ipi_action
for the PPC_MSG_RM_HOST_ACTION message.

When a guest is being destroyed, we need to ensure that there
are no pending IPIs waiting to wake up a VCPU before we free
the VCPUs of the guest. This is accomplished by:
- Forces a PPC_MSG_CALL_FUNCTION IPI to be completed by all CPUs
  before freeing any VCPUs in kvm_arch_destroy_vm().
- Any PPC_MSG_RM_HOST_ACTION messages must be executed first
  before any other PPC_MSG_CALL_FUNCTION messages.
