s390: add DEBUG_RODATA support

git commit d2aa1acad22f ("mm/init: Add 'rodata=off' boot cmdline
parameter to disable read-only kernel mappings") adds a bogus warning
to the console which states that s390 does not support kernel memory
protection.

This however is not true. We do support that since a couple of years
however in a different way than the author of the above named patch
expected.

To get rid of the misleading message implement the mark_rodata_ro
function and emit a message which states the amount of memory which
was write protected already earlier.

This is the same what parisc currently does.

We currently do not support the kernel parameter "rodata=off" which
would allow to write to the rodata section again. However since we
have this feature since years without any problems there is no reason
to add support for this.
