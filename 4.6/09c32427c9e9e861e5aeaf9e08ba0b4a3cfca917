clk: renesas: Rename header file renesas.h

This is part of an ongoing process to migrate from ARCH_SHMOBILE to
ARCH_RENESAS the motivation for which being that RENESAS seems to be a more
appropriate name than SHMOBILE for the majority of Renesas ARM based SoCs.

Along with the above mentioned Kconfig changes it seems appropriate
to also rename files.
