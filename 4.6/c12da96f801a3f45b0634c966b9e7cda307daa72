tty: Use 'disc' for line discipline index name

tty->ldisc is a ptr to struct tty_ldisc, but unfortunately 'ldisc' is
also used as a parameter or local name to refer to the line discipline
index value (ie, N_TTY, N_GSM, etc.); instead prefer the name used
by the line discipline registration/ref counting functions.
