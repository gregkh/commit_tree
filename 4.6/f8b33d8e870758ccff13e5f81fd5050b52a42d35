net_sched: dsmark: use qdisc_dequeue_peeked()

This fix is for dsmark similar to commit 3557619f0f6f7496ed453d4825e249
("net_sched: prio: use qdisc_dequeue_peeked")
and makes use of qdisc_dequeue_peeked() instead of direct dequeue() call.

First time, wrr peeks dsmark, which will then peek into sfq.
sfq dequeues an skb and it's stored in sch->gso_skb.
Next time, wrr tries to dequeue from dsmark, which will call sfq dequeue
directly. This results skipping the previously peeked skb.

So changed dsmark dequeue to call qdisc_dequeue_peeked() instead to use
peeked skb if exists.
