perf/x86/intel: Fix PEBS data source interpretation on Nehalem/Westmere

Jiri reported some time ago that some entries in the PEBS data source table
in perf do not agree with the SDM. We investigated and the bits
changed for Sandy Bridge, but the SDM was not updated.

perf already implements the bits correctly for Sandy Bridge
and later. This patch patches it up for Nehalem and Westmere.
