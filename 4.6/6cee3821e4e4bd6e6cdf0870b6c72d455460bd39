gpio/pinctrl: sunxi: stop poking around in private vars

This kind of hacks disturbs the refactoring of the gpiolib.

The descriptor table belongs to the gpiolib, if we want to know
something about something in it, use or define the proper accessor
functions. Let's add this gpiochip_lins_is_irq() to do what the
sunxi driver is trying at so we can privatize the descriptors
properly.
