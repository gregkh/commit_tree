uprobes: __create_xol_area() must nullify xol_mapping.fault

As Jiri pointed out, this recent commit:

 f872f5400cc0 ("mm: Add a vm_special_mapping.fault() method")

breaks uprobes: __create_xol_area() doesn't initialize the new ->fault()
method and this obviously leads to kernel crash when the application
tries to execute the probed insn after bp hit.

We probably want to add uprobes_special_mapping_fault(), this allows to
turn xol_area->xol_mapping into a single instance of vm_special_mapping.
But we need a simple fix, so lets change __create_xol() to nullify the
new member as Jiri suggests.
