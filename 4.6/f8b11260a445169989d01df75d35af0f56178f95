bcache: fix cache_set_flush() NULL pointer dereference on OOM

When bch_cache_set_alloc() fails to kzalloc the cache_set, the
asyncronous closure handling tries to dereference a cache_set that
hadn't yet been allocated inside of cache_set_flush() which is called
by __cache_set_unregister() during cleanup.  This appears to happen only
during an OOM condition on bcache_register.
