[media] v4l2-ctrls: add V4L2_CID_DV_RX/TX_IT_CONTENT_TYPE controls

HDMI and DisplayPort both support IT Content Type information that
tells the receiver what type of material the video is, graphics such
as from a PC desktop, Photo, Cinema or Game (low-latency).

This patch adds controls for receivers and transmitters to get/set
this information.
