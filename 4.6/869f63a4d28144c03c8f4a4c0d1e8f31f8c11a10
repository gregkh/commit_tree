mlxsw: spectrum: Check requested ageing time is valid

Commit c62987bbd8a1 ("bridge: push bridge setting ageing_time down to
switchdev") added a check for minimum and maximum ageing time, but this
breaks existing behaviour where one can set ageing time to 0 for a
non-learning bridge.

Push this check down to the driver and allow the check in the bridge
layer to be removed. Currently ageing time 0 is refused by the driver,
but we can later add support for this functionality.
