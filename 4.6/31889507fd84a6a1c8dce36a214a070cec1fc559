ASoC: wm5110: Add support for audio trace firmware

Mainly this adds DAI links for the audio trace, however, it is also
necessary to update the data IRQ handler to check more cores. We have
the handler check every core so it should not be necessary to update
this function if more compressed firmwares are added in the future.
