slub: relax CMPXCHG consistency restrictions

When debug options are enabled, cmpxchg on the page is disabled.  This
is because the page must be locked to ensure there are no false
positives when performing consistency checks.  Some debug options such
as poisoning and red zoning only act on the object itself.  There is no
need to protect other CPUs from modification on only the object.  Allow
cmpxchg to happen with poisoning and red zoning are set on a slab.
