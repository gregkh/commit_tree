rtc: max77686: Use a driver data struct instead hard-coded values

The driver has some hard-coded values such as the minimum delay needed
before a RTC update or the mask used for the sec/min/hour/etc registers.

Use a data structure that contains these values and pass as driver data
using the platform device ID table for each device.

This allows to make the driver's ops callbacks more generic so other RTC
that are similar but don't have the same values can also be supported.
