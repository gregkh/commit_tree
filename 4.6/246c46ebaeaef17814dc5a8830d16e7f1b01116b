firmware: create directory hierarchy for sysfs fw_cfg entries

Each fw_cfg entry of type "file" has an associated 56-char,
nul-terminated ASCII string which represents its name. While
the fw_cfg device doesn't itself impose any specific naming
convention, QEMU developers have traditionally used path name
semantics (i.e. "etc/acpi/rsdp") to descriptively name the
various fw_cfg "blobs" passed into the guest.

This patch attempts, on a best effort basis, to create a
directory hierarchy representing the content of fw_cfg file
names, under /sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg/by_name.

Upon successful creation of all directories representing the
"dirname" portion of a fw_cfg file, a symlink will be created
to represent the "basename", pointing at the appropriate
/sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg/by_key entry. If a file name is not
suitable for this procedure (e.g., if its basename or dirname
components collide with an already existing dirname component
or basename, respectively) the corresponding fw_cfg blob is
skipped and will remain available in sysfs only by its selector
key value.
