arm64: lib: patch in prfm for copy_page if requested

On ThunderX T88 pass 1 and pass 2, there is no hardware prefetching so
we need to patch in explicit software prefetching instructions

Prefetching improves this code by 60% over the original code and 2x
over the code without prefetching for the affected hardware using the
benchmark code at https://github.com/apinski-cavium/copy_page_benchmark
