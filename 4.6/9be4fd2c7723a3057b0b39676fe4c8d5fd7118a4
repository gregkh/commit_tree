cpufreq: governor: Replace timers with utilization update callbacks

Instead of using a per-CPU deferrable timer for queuing up governor
work items, register a utilization update callback that will be
invoked from the scheduler on utilization changes.

The sampling rate is still the same as what was used for the
deferrable timers and the added irq_work overhead should be offset by
the eliminated timers overhead, so in theory the functional impact of
this patch should not be significant.
