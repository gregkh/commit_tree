virtio_balloon: export 'available' memory to balloon statistics

Add a new field, VIRTIO_BALLOON_S_AVAIL, to virtio_balloon memory
statistics protocol, corresponding to 'Available' in /proc/meminfo.

It indicates to the hypervisor how big the balloon can be inflated
without pushing the guest system to swap.
