pinctrl: sh-pfc: make explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig / Makefile currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_PINCTRL_SH_PFC)    += sh-pfc.o
drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/Makefile:sh-pfc-objs                     = core.o pinctrl.o

drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/Kconfig:config PINCTRL_SH_PFC
drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/Kconfig: def_bool y

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init already wasn't being used in this code, the init
ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
