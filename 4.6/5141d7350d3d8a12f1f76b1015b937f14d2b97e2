perf data: Fix releasing event_class

A new patch in libbabeltrace [1] reveals a object leak problem in
'perf data' CTF support: perf code never releases the event_class
which is allocated in add_event() and stored in evsel's private field.

If libbabeltrace has the above patch applied, leaking event_class
prevents the writer from being destroyed and flushing metadata. For
example:

  $ perf record ls
  perf.data
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.012 MB perf.data (12 samples) ]
  $ perf data convert --to-ctf ./out.ctf
  [ perf data convert: Converted 'perf.data' into CTF data './out.ctf' ]
  [ perf data convert: Converted and wrote 0.000 MB (12 samples) ]
  $ cat ./out.ctf/metadata
  $ ls -l  ./out.ctf/metadata
  -rw-r----- 1 w00229757 mm 0 Jan 27 10:49 ./out.ctf/metadata

The correct result should be:
  ...
  $ cat ./out.ctf/metadata
  /* CTF 1.8 */

  trace {
  [SNIP]

  $ ls -l  ./out.ctf/metadata
  -rw-r----- 1 w00229757 mm 2446 Jan 27 10:52 ./out.ctf/metadata

The full story is:

Patch [1] of babeltrace redesigns its reference counting scheme. In that
patch:

 * writer <- trace (bt_ctf_writer_create)
 * trace <- stream_class (bt_ctf_trace_add_stream_class)
 * stream_class <- event_class (bt_ctf_stream_class_add_event_class)
 ('<-' means 'is a parent of')

Holding of event_class causes reference count of corresponding 'writer'
to increase through parent chain. Perf expects that 'writer' is released
(so metadata is flushed) through bt_ctf_writer_put() in
ctf_writer__cleanup(). However, since it never releases event_class, the
reference of 'writer' won't be dropped, so bt_ctf_writer_put() won't
lead to the release of writer.

Before this CTF patch, !(writer <- trace). Even with event_class leaking,
the writer ends up being released.
