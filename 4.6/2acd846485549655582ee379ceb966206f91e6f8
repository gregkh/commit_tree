rtlwifi: fix gcc-6 indentation warning

The rtl8821ae_dm_txpower_tracking_callback_thermalmeter function
contains a call to RT_TRACE() that is indented in a misleading
way, as pointed out by a gcc-6 warning:

drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl8821ae/dm.c: In function 'rtl8821ae_dm_txpower_tracking_callback_thermalmeter':
drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl8821ae/dm.c:2491:4: error: statement is indented as if it were guarded by...
    RT_TRACE(rtlpriv, COMP_POWER_TRACKING, DBG_LOUD,
    ^~~~~~~~
drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl8821ae/dm.c:2488:3: note: ...this 'for' clause, but it is not
   for (p = RF90_PATH_A; p < MAX_PATH_NUM_8821A; p++)
   ^~~

It is clear from the context that the call was not meant to be
part of the loop and only the indentation is wrong, so this
removes the extra tabs.
