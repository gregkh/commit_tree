[media] vivid: fix broken Bayer text rendering

Sometimes when a Bayer pixelformat is selected the rendering of the OSD text
by vivid was all wrong: every other line of the text was shifted by half the width
or more.

It turned out that to render Bayer formats the interleaved boolean is set to true
in the tpg. This mode indicates a semi-biplanar mode where two interleaved planes
are used to render the frame. From outside the tpg it looks like a single plane,
but internally it is two planes.

However, in the tpg_s_bytesperline() function the interleaved bool wasn't checked
and only the bytesperline value for plane 0 was updated. But for the interleaved
mode the same value has to be copied to bytesperline[1] as well.

The effect was that whatever old value was left in bytesperline[1] was used, which
caused all sorts of weird and seemingly unpredictable shifts.
