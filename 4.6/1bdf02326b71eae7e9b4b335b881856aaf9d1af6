clk: at91: make use of syscon/regmap internally

Use the regmap coming from syscon to access the registers instead of using
pmc_read/pmc_write. This allows to avoid passing the at91_pmc structure to
the child nodes of the PMC.

The final benefit is to have each clock register itself instead of having
to iterate over the children.
