drm/radeon/mst: fix regression in lane/link handling.

The function this used changed in
    092c96a8ab9d1bd60ada2ed385cc364ce084180e
    drm/radeon: fix dp link rate selection (v2)

However for MST we should just always train to the
max link/rate. Though we probably need to limit this
for future hw, in theory radeon won't support it.

This fixes my 30" monitor with MST enabled.
