arm64: KVM: Turn kvm_ksym_ref into a NOP on VHE

When running with VHE, there is no need to translate kernel pointers
to the EL2 memory space, since we're already there (and we have a much
saner memory map to start with).

Unfortunately, kvm_ksym_ref is getting in the way, and the first
call into the "hypervisor" section is going to end up in fireworks,
since we're now branching into nowhereland. Meh.

A potential solution is to test if VHE is engaged or not, and only
perform the translation in the negative case. With this in place,
VHE is able to run again.
