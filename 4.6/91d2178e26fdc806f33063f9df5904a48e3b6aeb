ALSA: timer: fix gparams ioctl compatibility for different architectures

'struct snd_timer_gparams' includes some members with 'unsigned long',
therefore its size differs depending on data models of architecture. As
a result, x86/x32 applications fail to execute ioctl(2) with
SNDRV_TIMER_GPARAMS command on x86_64 machine.

This commit fixes this bug by adding a pair of structure and ioctl
command for the compatibility.
