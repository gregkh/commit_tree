drm/i915/fbc: wait for a vblank instead of 50ms when enabling

Instead of waiting for 50ms, just wait until the next vblank, since
it's the minimum requirement. The whole infrastructure of FBC is based
on vblanks, so waiting for X vblanks instead of X milliseconds sounds
like the correct way to go. Besides, 50ms may be less than a vblank on
super slow modes that may or may not exist.

There are some small improvements in PC state residency (due to the
fact that we're now using 16ms for the common modes instead of 50ms),
but the biggest advantage is still the correctness of being
vblank-based instead of time-based.

v2:
  - Rebase after changing the patch order.
  - Update the commit message.
v3:
  - Fix bogus vblank_get() instead of vblank_count() (Ville).
  - Don't forget to call drm_crtc_vblank_{get,put} (Chris, Ville)
  - Adjust the performance details on the commit message.
v4:
  - Don't grab the FBC mutex just to grab the vblank (Maarten)
