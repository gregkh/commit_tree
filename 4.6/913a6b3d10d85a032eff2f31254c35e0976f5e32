powerpc/8xx: Save r3 all the time in DTLB miss handler

We are spending between 40 and 160 cycles with a mean of 65 cycles in
the DTLB handling routine (measured with mftbl) so make it more
simple althought it adds one instruction.
With this modification, we get three registers available at all time,
which will help with following patch.
