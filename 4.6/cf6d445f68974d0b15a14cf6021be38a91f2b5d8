perf/x86/uncore: Track packages, not per CPU data

Uncore is a per package facility, but the code tries to mimick a per CPU
facility with completely convoluted constructs.

Simplify the whole machinery by tracking per package information. While at it,
avoid the kfree/alloc dance when a CPU goes offline and online again. There is
no point in freeing the box after it was allocated. We just keep proper
refcounting and the first CPU which comes online in a package does the
initialization/activation of the box.
