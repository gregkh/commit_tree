drm/i915: Add PSR main link standby support back

Link standby support has been deprecated with 'commit 89251b177
("drm/i915: PSR: deprecate link_standby support for core platforms.")'

The reason for that is that main link in full off offers more power
savings and on HSW and BDW implementations on source side had known
bugs with link standby.

However that same HSD report only mentions BDW and HSW and tells that
a fix was going to new platforms. Since on Skylake link standby
didn't cause the bad blank flickering screens seen on HSW and BDW
let's respect VBT again for this and future platforms.
