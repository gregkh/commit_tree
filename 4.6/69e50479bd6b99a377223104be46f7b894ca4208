remoteproc: debugfs: Add ability to boot remote processor using debugfs

This functionality is especially useful during the testing phase.  When
used in conjunction with Mailbox's Test Framework we can trivially conduct
end-to-end testing i.e. boot co-processor, send and receive messages to
the co-processor, then shut it down again (repeat as required).
