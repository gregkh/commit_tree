locking/qspinlock: Move __ARCH_SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED to qspinlock_types.h

Move the __ARCH_SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED definition from qspinlock.h into
qspinlock_types.h.

The definition of __ARCH_SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED comes from the build arch's
include files; but on x86 when CONFIG_QUEUED_SPINLOCKS=y, it just
it's defined in asm-generic/qspinlock.h.  In most cases, this doesn't
matter because linux/spinlock.h includes asm/spinlock.h, which for x86
includes asm-generic/qspinlock.h.  However, any code that only includes
linux/mutex.h will break, because it only includes asm/spinlock_types.h.

For example, this breaks systemtap, which only includes mutex.h.
