iwlwifi: mvm: Disable beacon storing in  D3 when WOWLAN configured

Currently when entering D3 with WOWLAN configured, we enable in the
configuration flags beacon storing, and do not disable beacon
filtering, and do not wake up from a magic packet.

Having both enabled is wrong (should not have both enabled),
and causes problems in the RX queues in the FW, causing
the FW not to recognize the magic packet when it comes.

Disable beacon storing in wowlan configuration.
