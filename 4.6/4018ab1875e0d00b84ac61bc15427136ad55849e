bpf: support flow label for bpf_skb_{set, get}_tunnel_key

This patch extends bpf_tunnel_key with a tunnel_label member, that maps
to ip_tunnel_key's label so underlying backends like vxlan and geneve
can propagate the label to udp_tunnel6_xmit_skb(), where it's being set
in the IPv6 header. It allows for having 20 more bits to encode/decode
flow related meta information programmatically. Tested with vxlan and
geneve.
