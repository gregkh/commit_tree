ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Enable playback on all enumerated ports

Last patch added infrastructure to render over all the ports,
PCM<->cvt<- pin mapping and user selection of controls. But we
still have restriction of playback on the default port alone, so
remove that.

This patch removes the hardcoding of cvt<->pin map from the dai.
Cvt and pin for a dai are now derived from the already stored pcm
list of device opened.  We query connection list of a pin from
codec to validate the cvt<->pin map.

If connection list returns zero, then monitor is not connected so
fail playback.
