powerpc/process: Fix altivec SPR not being saved

In save_sprs() in process.c contains the following test:

	if (cpu_has_feature(cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_ALTIVEC)))
		t->vrsave = mfspr(SPRN_VRSAVE);

CPU feature with the mask 0x1 is CPU_FTR_COHERENT_ICACHE so the test
is equivilent to:

	if (cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_ALTIVEC) &&
		cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_COHERENT_ICACHE))

On CPUs without support for both (i.e G5) this results in vrsave not
being saved between context switches. The vector register save/restore
code doesn't use VRSAVE to determine which registers to save/restore,
but the value of VRSAVE is used to determine if altivec is being used
in several code paths.
