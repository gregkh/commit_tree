batman-adv: Rename batadv_dat_entry *_free_ref function to *_put

The batman-adv source code is the only place in the kernel which uses the
*_free_ref naming scheme for the *_put functions. Changing it to *_put
makes it more consistent and makes it easier to understand the connection
to the *_get functions.
