lightnvm: specify target's logical address area

We can create more than one target on a lightnvm
device by specifying its begin lun and end lun.

But only specify the physical address area is not
enough, we need to get the corresponding non-
intersection logical address area division from
the backend device's logcial address space.
Otherwise the targets on the device might use
the same logical addresses cause incorrect
information in the device's l2p table.
