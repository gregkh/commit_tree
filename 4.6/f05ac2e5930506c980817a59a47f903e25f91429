scsi: ufs: avoid exception event handler racing with PM callbacks

If device raises the exception event in the response to the commands
sent during the runtime/system PM callbacks, exception event handler
might run in parallel with PM callbacks and may see unclocked register
accesses. This change fixes this issue by not scheduling the exception
event handler while PM callbacks are running.
