IB/rdmavt: Add support for tracing events

This patch adds support of tracing events using the kernels built-in event
tracing infrastructure. This can be extended to provide a wide range of
trace and debug capabilities which have a negligible impact on performance
when enabled. These should be preferred over the use of the rvt_pr*
functions.
