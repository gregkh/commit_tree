dm mpath: remove repeat_count support from multipath core

Preparation for making __multipath_map() avoid taking the m->lock
spinlock -- in favor of using RCU locking.

repeat_count was primarily for bio-based DM multipath's benefit.  There
is really no need for it anymore now that DM multipath is request-based.
As such, repeat_count > 1 is no longer honored and a warning is
displayed if the user attempts to use a value > 1.  This is a temporary
change for the round-robin path-selector (as a later commit will restore
its support for repeat_count > 1).
