phy: fixed: Fix removal of phys.

The fixed phys delete function simply removed the fixed phy from the
internal linked list and freed the memory. It however did not
unregister the associated phy device. This meant it was still possible
to find the phy device on the mdio bus.

Make fixed_phy_del() an internal function and add a
fixed_phy_unregister() to unregisters the phy device and then uses
fixed_phy_del() to free resources.

Modify DSA to use this new API function, so we don't leak phys.
