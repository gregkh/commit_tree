mm, tracing: unify mm flags handling in tracepoints and printk

In tracepoints, it's possible to print gfp flags in a human-friendly
format through a macro show_gfp_flags(), which defines a translation
array and passes is to __print_flags().  Since the following patch will
introduce support for gfp flags printing in printk(), it would be nice
to reuse the array.  This is not straightforward, since __print_flags()
can't simply reference an array defined in a .c file such as mm/debug.c
- it has to be a macro to allow the macro magic to communicate the
format to userspace tools such as trace-cmd.

The solution is to create a macro __def_gfpflag_names which is used both
in show_gfp_flags(), and to define the gfpflag_names[] array in
mm/debug.c.

On the other hand, mm/debug.c also defines translation tables for page
flags and vma flags, and desire was expressed (but not implemented in
this series) to use these also from tracepoints.  Thus, this patch also
renames the events/gfpflags.h file to events/mmflags.h and moves the
table definitions there, using the same macro approach as for gfpflags.
This allows translating all three kinds of mm-specific flags both in
tracepoints and printk.
