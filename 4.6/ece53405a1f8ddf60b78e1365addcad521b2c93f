tty: Reset c_line from driver's init_termios

After the ldisc is released, but before the tty is destroyed, the termios
is saved (in tty_free_termios()); this termios is restored if a new
tty is created on next open(). However, the line discipline is always
reset, which is not obvious in the current method. Instead, reset
as part of the restore.

Restore the original line discipline, which may not have been N_TTY.
