openvswitch: allow management from inside user namespaces

Operations with the GENL_ADMIN_PERM flag fail permissions checks because
this flag means we call netlink_capable, which uses the init user ns.

Instead, let's introduce a new flag, GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM for operations
which should be allowed inside a user namespace.

The motivation for this is to be able to run openvswitch in unprivileged
containers. I've tested this and it seems to work, but I really have no
idea about the security consequences of this patch, so thoughts would be
much appreciated.

v2: use the GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM flag instead of a check in each function
v3: use separate ifs for UNS_ADMIN_PERM and ADMIN_PERM, instead of one
    massive one
