mailbox: Stop using ENOSYS for anything other than unimplemented syscalls

In accordance with e15f431fe2d5 ("errno.h: Improve ENOSYS's comment") and
91c9afaf97ee ("checkpatch.pl: new instances of ENOSYS are errors") we're
converting from the old meaning of: ENOSYS "Function not implemented" to
a more standard EINVAL.
