virtio/s390: size of SET_IND payload

SET_IND takes as a payload the _address_ of the indicators, meaning
that we have one of the rare cases where kmalloc(sizeof(&...)) is
actually correct. Let's clarify that with a comment.

The count for the ccw, however, was only correct because the
indicators are 64 bit. Let's use the correct value.
