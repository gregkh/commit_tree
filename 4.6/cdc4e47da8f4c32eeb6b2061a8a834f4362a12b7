bpf: avoid copying junk bytes in bpf_get_current_comm()

Lots of places in the kernel use memcpy(buf, comm, TASK_COMM_LEN); but
the result is typically passed to print("%s", buf) and extra bytes
after zero don't cause any harm.
In bpf the result of bpf_get_current_comm() is used as the part of
map key and was causing spurious hash map mismatches.
Use strlcpy() to guarantee zero-terminated string.
bpf verifier checks that output buffer is zero-initialized,
so even for short task names the output buffer don't have junk bytes.
Note it's not a security concern, since kprobe+bpf is root only.
