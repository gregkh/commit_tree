tty: Remove chars_in_buffer() line discipline method

The chars_in_buffer() line discipline method serves no functional
purpose, other than as a (dubious) debugging aid for mostly bit-rotting
drivers. Despite being documented as an optional method, every caller
is unconditionally executed (although conditionally compiled).
Furthermore, direct tty->ldisc access without an ldisc ref is unsafe.
Lastly, N_TTY's chars_in_buffer() has warned of removal since 3.12.
