orangefs: fix orangefs_superblock locking

* switch orangefs_remount() to taking ORANGEFS_SB(sb) instead of sb
* remove from the list _before_ orangefs_unmount() - request_mutex
in the latter will make sure that nothing observed in the loop in
ORANGEFS_DEV_REMOUNT_ALL handling will get freed until the end
of loop
* on removal, keep the forward pointer and zero the back one.  That
way we can drop and regain the spinlock in the loop body (again,
ORANGEFS_DEV_REMOUNT_ALL one) and still be able to get to the
rest of the list.
