powerpc/powernv: use one M64 BAR in Single PE mode for one VF BAR

In current implementation, when VF BAR is bigger than 64MB, it uses 4 M64
BARs in Single PE mode to cover the number of VFs required to be enabled.
By doing so, several VFs would be in one VF Group and leads to interference
between VFs in the same group.

And in this patch, m64_wins is renamed to m64_map, which means index number
of the M64 BAR used to map the VF BAR. Based on Gavin's comments. Also
makes sure the VF BAR size is bigger than 32MB when M64 BAR is used in
Single PE mode.

This patch changes the design by using one M64 BAR in Single PE mode for
one VF BAR. This gives absolute isolation for VFs.
