rcu: Make rcu/tiny_plugin.h explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

init/Kconfig:config TINY_RCU
init/Kconfig:   bool

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the code there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.  We could
consider moving this to an earlier initcall (subsys?) if desired.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
