scsi_dh_alua: Send TEST UNIT READY to poll for transitioning

Sending a 'REPORT TARGET PORT GROUP' command is a costly operation,
as the array has to gather information about all ports.
So instead of using RTPG to poll for a status update when a port
is in transitioning we should be sending a TEST UNIT READY, and
wait for the sense code to report success.
