spi: spi-pxa2xx-pci: Add ID and driver type for WildcatPoint PCH

WildcatPoint PCH as seen on MacBook 12-inch (Early 2015) has a PCI enabled
SPI controller. Enable it by adding its ID to the corresponding driver.
The ACPI enumerated name for this SPI controller (found in spi-pxa2xx.c) is INT33C1.
Therefore, we associate the SPI controller with the corresponding type of LPSS_LPT_SSP.
