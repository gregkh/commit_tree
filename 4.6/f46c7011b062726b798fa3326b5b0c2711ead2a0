sctp: move rcu_read_lock from __sctp_lookup_association to sctp_lookup_association

__sctp_lookup_association() is only invoked by sctp_v4_err() and
sctp_rcv(), both which run on the rx BH, and it has been protected
by rcu_read_lock [see ip_local_deliver_finish() / ipv6_rcv()].

So we can move it to sctp_lookup_association, only let
sctp_lookup_association use rcu_read_lock.
