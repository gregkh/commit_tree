mlxsw: spectrum: Store local port to module mapping during init

The port netdevs are each associated with a different local port number
in the device. These local ports are grouped into groups of 4 (e.g.
(1-4), (5-8)) called clusters. The cluster constitutes the one of two
possible modules they can be mapped to. This mapping is board-specific
and done by the device's firmware during init.

When splitting a port by 4, the device requires us to first unmap all
the ports in the cluster and then map each to a single lane in the module
associated with the port netdev used as the handle for the operation.
This means that two port netdevs will disappear, as only 100Gb/s (4
lanes) ports can be split and we are guaranteed to have two of these
((1, 3), (5, 7) etc.) in a cluster.

When unsplit occurs we need to reinstantiate the two original 100Gb/s
ports and map each to its origianl module. Therefore, during driver init
store the initial local port to module mapping, so it can be used later
during unsplitting.

Note that a by 2 split doesn't require us to store the mapping, as we
only need to reinstantiate one port whose module is known.
