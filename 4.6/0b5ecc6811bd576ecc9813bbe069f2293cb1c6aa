batman-adv: add throughput override attribute to hard_ifaces

This attribute is exported to user space to disable the link
throughput auto-detection by setting a fixed value.
The throughput override value is used when batman-adv is
computing the link throughput towards a neighbour.

If the value is set to 0 then batman-adv will try to detect
the throughput by itself.
