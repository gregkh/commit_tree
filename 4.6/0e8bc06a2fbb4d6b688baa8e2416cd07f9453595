KVM: s390: PSW forwarding / rewinding / ilc rework

We have some confusion about ilc vs. ilen in our current code. So let's
correctly use the term ilen when dealing with (ilc << 1).

Program irq injection didn't take care of the correct ilc in case of
irqs triggered by EXECUTE functions, let's provide one function
kvm_s390_get_ilen() to take care of all that.

Also, manually specifying in intercept handlers the size of the
instruction (and sometimes overwriting that value for EXECUTE internally)
doesn't make too much sense. So also provide the functions:
- kvm_s390_retry_instr to retry the currently intercepted instruction
- kvm_s390_rewind_psw to rewind the PSW without internal overwrites
- kvm_s390_forward_psw to forward the PSW
