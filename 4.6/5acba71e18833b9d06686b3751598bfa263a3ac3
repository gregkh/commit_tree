locking/atomic: Introduce atomic_fetch_or()

This is deemed to replace the type generic fetch_or() which brings a lot
of issues such as macro induced block variable aliasing and sloppy types.
Not to mention fetch_or() doesn't refer to any namespace, adding even
more confusion.

So lets provide an atomic_t version. Current and next users of fetch_or()
are thus encouraged to use atomic_t.
