RAID5: check_reshape() shouldn't call mddev_suspend

check_reshape() is called from raid5d thread. raid5d thread shouldn't
call mddev_suspend(), because mddev_suspend() waits for all IO finish
but IO is handled in raid5d thread, we could easily deadlock here.

This issue is introduced by
738a273 ("md/raid5: fix allocation of 'scribble' array.")
