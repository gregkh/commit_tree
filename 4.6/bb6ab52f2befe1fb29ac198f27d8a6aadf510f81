intel_pstate: Do not set utilization update hook too early

The utilization update hook in the intel_pstate driver is set too
early, as it only should be set after the policy has been fully
initialized by the core.  That may cause intel_pstate_update_util()
to use incorrect data and put the CPUs into incorrect P-states as
a result.

To prevent that from happening, make intel_pstate_set_policy() set
the utilization update hook instead of intel_pstate_init_cpu() so
intel_pstate_update_util() only runs when all things have been
initialized as appropriate.
