[media] Revert "[media] media: au0828 change to use Managed Media Controller API"

Extending the lifetime of the media_device struct is not handled well
by the core, as it will erase some data from the struct, when
media_device_cleanup() is called after unregistering it.

While we have a fixup patch for it already, the usage of those new
functions are needed only when we share data with other drivers.

So, better to revert the changes.

This reverts commit 182dde7c5d4c ("[media] media: au0828 change
to use Managed Media Controller API")
