ARM: make virt_to_idmap() return unsigned long

Make virt_to_idmap() return an unsigned long rather than phys_addr_t.

Returning phys_addr_t here makes no sense, because the definition of
virt_to_idmap() is that it shall return a physical address which maps
identically with the virtual address.  Since virtual addresses are
limited to 32-bit, identity mapped physical addresses are as well.

Almost all users already had an implicit narrowing cast to unsigned long
so let's make this official and part of this interface.
