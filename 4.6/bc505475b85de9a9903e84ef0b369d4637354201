cpufreq: governor: Rearrange governor data structures

The struct policy_dbs_info objects representing per-policy governor
data are not accessible directly from the corresponding policy
objects.  To access them, one has to get a pointer to the
struct cpu_dbs_info of policy->cpu and use the policy_dbs field of
that which isn't really straightforward.

To address that rearrange the governor data structures so the
governor_data pointer in struct cpufreq_policy will point to
struct policy_dbs_info (instead of struct dbs_data) and that will
contain a pointer to struct dbs_data.
