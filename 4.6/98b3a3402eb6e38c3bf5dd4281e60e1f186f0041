drm/nouveau: Defer probe if gmux is present but its driver isn't

gmux is a microcontroller built into dual GPU MacBook Pros.
On pre-retina MBPs, if we're the inactive GPU, we need apple-gmux
to temporarily switch DDC so that we can probe the panel's EDID.

The checks for CONFIG_VGA_ARB and CONFIG_VGA_SWITCHEROO are necessary
because if either of them is disabled but gmux is present, the driver
would never load, even if we're the active GPU. (vga_default_device()
would evaluate to NULL and vga_switcheroo_handler_flags() would
evaluate to 0.)
