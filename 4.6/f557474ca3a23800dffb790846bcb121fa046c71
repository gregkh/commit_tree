tty: Add fasync() hung up file operation

VFS uses a two-stage check-and-call method for invoking file_operations
methods, without explicitly snapshotting either the file_operations ptr
or the function ptr. Since the tty core is one of the few VFS users that
changes the f_op file_operations ptr of the file descriptor (when the
tty has been hung up), and since the likelihood of the compiler generating
a reload of either f_op or the function ptr is basically nil, just define
a hung up fasync() file operation that returns an error.
