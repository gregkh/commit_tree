modules: split part of complete_formation() into prepare_coming_module()

Put all actions in complete_formation() that are performed after
module->state is set to MODULE_STATE_COMING into a separate function
prepare_coming_module(). This split prepares for the removal of the
livepatch module notifiers in favor of hard-coding function calls to
klp_module_{coming,going} in the module loader.

The complete_formation -> prepare_coming_module split will also make error
handling easier since we can jump to the appropriate error label to do any
module GOING cleanup after all the COMING-actions have completed.
