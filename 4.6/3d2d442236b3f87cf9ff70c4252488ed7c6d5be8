iwlwifi: support ucode with d0 unified image - regular and usniffer

Till today, the ucode consisted of two d0 images - regular,
in which the usniffer wasn't enabled, and usniffer, in which the
usniffer logs were enabled.
Lately, the two images were unified, so there is only one d0 image,
in which the usniffer logs are enabled.

Add new TLV capability for supporting the consolidated images
(set 2, bit 13).
