printk: add clear_idx symbol to vmcoreinfo

This allows us to extract from the vmcore only the messages emitted
since the last time the ring buffer was cleared.  We just have to make
sure its value is always up-to-date, when old messages are discarded to
free space in log_make_free_space() for example.
