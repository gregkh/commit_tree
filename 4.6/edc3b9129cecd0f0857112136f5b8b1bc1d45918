x86/mm/pat: Ensure cpa->pfn only contains page frame numbers

The x86 pageattr code is confused about the data that is stored
in cpa->pfn, sometimes it's treated as a page frame number,
sometimes it's treated as an unshifted physical address, and in
one place it's treated as a pte.

The result of this is that the mapping functions do not map the
intended physical address.

This isn't a problem in practice because most of the addresses
we're mapping in the EFI code paths are already mapped in
'trampoline_pgd' and so the pageattr mapping functions don't
actually do anything in this case. But when we move to using a
separate page table for the EFI runtime this will be an issue.
