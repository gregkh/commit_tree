clk: simplify __clk_init_parent()

The translation from the index into clk_core is done by
clk_core_get_parent_by_index().  The if-block for num_parents == 1
case is duplicating the code in the clk_core_get_parent_by_index().

Drop the "if (num_parents == 1)" from the special case.  Instead,
set the index to zero if .get_parent() is missing.
