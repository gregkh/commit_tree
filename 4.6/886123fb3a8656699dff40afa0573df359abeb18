x86/tsc: Read all ratio bits from MSR_PLATFORM_INFO

Currently we read the tsc radio: ratio = (MSR_PLATFORM_INFO >> 8) & 0x1f;

Thus we get bit 8-12 of MSR_PLATFORM_INFO, however according to the SDM
(35.5), the ratio bits are bit 8-15.

Ignoring the upper bits can result in an incorrect tsc ratio, which causes the
TSC calibration and the Local APIC timer frequency to be incorrect.

Fix this problem by masking 0xff instead.
