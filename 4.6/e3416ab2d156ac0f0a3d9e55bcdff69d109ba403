iser-target: Kill the ->isert_cmd back pointer in struct iser_tx_desc

We only use the pointer when processing regular iSER commands, and it then
always points to the struct iser_cmd that contains the TX descriptor.

Remove it and rely on container_of to save a little space and avoid a
pointer that is updated multiple times per processed command.
