tpm_crb: Use the common ACPI definition of struct acpi_tpm2

include/acpi/actbl2.h is the proper place for these definitions
and the needed TPM2 ones have been there since
commit 413d4a6defe0 ("ACPICA: Update TPM2 ACPI table")

This also drops a couple of le32_to_cpu's for members of this table,
the existing swapping was not done consistently, and the standard
used by other Linux callers of acpi_get_table is unswapped.
