usb: dwc2: host: Set host_rx_fifo_size to 525 for rk3066

As documented in dwc2_calculate_dynamic_fifo(), host_rx_fifo_size should
really be:
 2 * ((Largest Packet size / 4) + 1 + 1) + n
 with n = number of host channel.

We have 9 host channels, so
 2 * ((1024/4) + 2) + 9 = 516 + 9 = 525

We've got 960 / 972 total_fifo_size on rk3288 (and presumably on
rk3066) and 525 + 128 + 256 = 909 so we're still under on both ports
even when we increment by 5.

In the future, it would be nice if dwc2_calculate_dynamic_fifo() could
handle the "too small" FIFO case and come up with something more
dynamically.  When we do that we can figure out how to allocate the
extra 48 / 60 bytes of FIFO that we're currently wasting.

NOTE: no known bugs are fixed by this patch, but it seems like a simple
fix and ought to fix someone.
