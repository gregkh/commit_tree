xfs: RT bitmap and summary buffers need verifiers

Buffers without verifiers issue runtime warnings on XFS. We don't
have anything we can actually verify in the RT buffers (no CRCs, not
magic numbers, etc), but we still need verifiers to avoid the
warnings.

Add a set of dummy verifier operations for the realtime buffers and
apply them in the appropriate places.
