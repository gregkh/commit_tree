scripts/gdb: add version command

lx-version Report the Linux Version of the current kernel.

Add a command to identify the version specified by the banner in the
debugged kernel.

This lets the user identify the kernel of the running kernel, and will
let later scripts compare the banner of the attached kernel against the
banner in the vmlinux symbols files to verify that the files are
correct.
