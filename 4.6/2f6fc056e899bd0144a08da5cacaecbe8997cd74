nfsd: fix deadlock secinfo+readdir compound

nfsd_lookup_dentry exits with the parent filehandle locked.  fh_put also
unlocks if necessary (nfsd filehandle locking is probably too lenient),
so it gets unlocked eventually, but if the following op in the compound
needs to lock it again, we can deadlock.

A fuzzer ran into this; normal clients don't send a secinfo followed by
a readdir in the same compound.
