Orangefs: Clean up pvfs2_devreq_read.

* Kick invalid arguments out early, so handling them does not clutter
  the code.
* Avoid possibility of race by not releasing lock until completely done.
* Do not leak ops (memory) in certain error condition.
* Check for more error conditions.
* Put module name in all error and debug logs.
* Document behavior.
