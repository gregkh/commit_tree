samples/bpf: add bpf map stress test

this test calls bpf programs from different contexts:
from inside of slub, from rcu, from pretty much everywhere,
since it kprobes all spin_lock functions.
It stresses the bpf hash and percpu map pre-allocation,
deallocation logic and call_rcu mechanisms.
User space part adding more stress by walking and deleting map elements.

Note that due to nature bpf_load.c the earlier kprobe+bpf programs are
already active while loader loads new programs, creates new kprobes and
attaches them.
