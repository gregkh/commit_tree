kcm: Add receive message timeout

This patch adds receive timeout for message assembly on the attached TCP
sockets. The timeout is set when a new messages is started and the whole
message has not been received by TCP (not in the receive queue). If the
completely message is subsequently received the timer is cancelled, if the
timer expires the RX side is aborted.

The timeout value is taken from the socket timeout (SO_RCVTIMEO) that is
set on a TCP socket (i.e. set by get sockopt before attaching a TCP socket
to KCM.
