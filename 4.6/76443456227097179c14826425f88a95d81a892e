net: Move GSO csum into SKB_GSO_CB

This patch moves the checksum maintained by GSO out of skb->csum and into
the GSO context block in order to allow for us to work on outer checksums
while maintaining the inner checksum offsets in the case of the inner
checksum being offloaded, while the outer checksums will be computed.

While updating the code I also did a minor cleanu-up on gso_make_checksum.
The change is mostly to make it so that we store the values and compute the
checksum instead of computing the checksum and then storing the values we
needed to update.
