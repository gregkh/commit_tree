ARM: OMAP: Correct interrupt type for ARM TWD

The ARM TWD interrupt is a private peripheral interrupt (PPI) and per
the ARM GIC documentation, whether the type for PPIs can be set is
IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. For OMAP4 devices the PPI type cannot be set and
so when we attempt to set the type for the ARM TWD interrupt it fails.
This has done unnoticed because it fails silently and because we cannot
re-configure the type it has had no impact. Nevertheless fix the type
for the TWD interrupt so that it matches the hardware configuration.
