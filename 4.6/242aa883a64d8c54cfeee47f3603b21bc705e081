cpufreq: Remove 'policy->governor_enabled'

The entire sequence of events (like INIT/START or STOP/EXIT) for which
cpufreq_governor() is called, is guaranteed to be protected by
policy->rwsem now.

The additional checks that were added earlier (as we were forced to drop
policy->rwsem before calling cpufreq_governor() for EXIT event), aren't
required anymore.

Over that, they weren't sufficient really. They just take care of
START/STOP events, but not INIT/EXIT and the state machine was never
maintained properly by them.

Kill the unnecessary checks and policy->governor_enabled field.
