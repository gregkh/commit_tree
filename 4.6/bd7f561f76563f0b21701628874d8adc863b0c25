powerpc/smp: Support more IPI messages

This patch increases the number of demuxed messages for a
controller with a single ipi to 8 for 64-bit systems.

This is required because we want to use the IPI mechanism
to send messages from a CPU running in KVM real mode in a
guest to a CPU in the host to take some action. Currently,
we only support 4 messages and all 4 are already taken.

Define a fifth message PPC_MSG_RM_HOST_ACTION for this
purpose.
