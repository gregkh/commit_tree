device property: fix for a case of use-after-free

In device_remove_property_set(), the secondary fwnode needs
to be cleared before the pset is freed. This fixes a
use-after-free when a property set is providing the primary
fwnode.

As a result of the fix, the primary fwnode may end up
containing ERR_PTR(-ENODEV), so also adding checks for it to
the property handling code.
