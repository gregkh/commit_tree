intel_idle: Fix dangling registration on error path.

In the module_init() method, if the per-CPU allocation fails, then the
active cpuidle registration is not cleaned up.  This patch fixes the
issue by attempting the allocation before registration, and then
cleaning it up again on registration failure.
