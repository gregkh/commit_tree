mtip32xx: Fix for rmmod crash when drive is in FTL rebuild

When FTL rebuild is in progress, alloc_disk() initializes the disk
but device node will be created by add_disk() only after successful
completion of FTL rebuild. So, skip deletion of device node in
removal path when FTL rebuild is in progress.
