x86/vdso: Track each mm's loaded vDSO image as well as its base

As we start to do more intelligent things with the vDSO at
runtime (as opposed to just at mm initialization time), we'll
need to know which vDSO is in use.

In principle, we could guess based on the mm type, but that's
over-complicated and error-prone.  Instead, just track it in the
mmu context.
