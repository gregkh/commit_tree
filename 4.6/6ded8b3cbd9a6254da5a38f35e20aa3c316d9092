cxlflash: Unmap problem state area before detaching master context

When operating in the PowerVM environment, the cxlflash module can
receive an error from the hypervisor indicating that there are
existing mappings in the page table for the process MMIO space.

This issue exists because term_afu() currently invokes term_mc()
before stop_afu(), allowing for the master context to be detached
first and the problem state area to be unmapped second.

To resolve this issue, stop_afu() should be called before term_mc().
