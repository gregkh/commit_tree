mm/page_poisoning.c: allow for zero poisoning

By default, page poisoning uses a poison value (0xaa) on free.  If this
is changed to 0, the page is not only sanitized but zeroing on alloc
with __GFP_ZERO can be skipped as well.  The tradeoff is that detecting
corruption from the poisoning is harder to detect.  This feature also
cannot be used with hibernation since pages are not guaranteed to be
zeroed after hibernation.
