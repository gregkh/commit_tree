btrfs: reada: ignore creating reada_extent for a non-existent device

For a non-existent device, old code bypasses adding it in dev's reada
queue.

And to solve problem of unfinished waitting in raid5/6,
commit 5fbc7c59fd22 ("Btrfs: fix unfinished readahead thread for
raid5/6 degraded mounting")
adding an exception for the first stripe, in short, the first
stripe will always be processed whether the device exists or not.

Actually we have a better way for the above request: just bypass
creation of the reada_extent for non-existent device, it will make
code simple and effective.
