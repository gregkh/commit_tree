net: thunderx: Adjust nicvf structure to reduce cache misses

Adjusted nicvf structure such that all elements used in hot
path like napi, xmit e.t.c fall into same cache line. This reduced
no of cache misses and resulted in ~2% increase in no of packets
handled on a core.

Also modified elements with :1 notation to boolean, to be
consistent with other element definitions.
