i40e/i40evf: Do not write to descriptor unless we complete

This patch defers writing to the Tx descriptor bits until we know we have
successfully completed a given operation.  So for example we defer updating
the tunnelling portion of the context descriptor until we have fully
identified the type.

The advantage to this approach is that we can assemble values as we go
instead of having to try and kludge everything together all at once.  As a
result we can significantly clean up the tunneling configuration for
instance as we can just do a pointer walk and do the math for the distance
between each set of points.
