selftests/powerpc: Fix out of bounds access in TM signal test

Gcc helpfully points out that we're accessing past the end of the gprs
array:

  tm-signal-msr-resv.c: In function 'signal_usr1':
  tm-signal-msr-resv.c:43:37: error: array subscript is above array bounds [-Werror=array-bounds]
    ucp->uc_mcontext.regs->gpr[PT_MSR] |= (7ULL);

We haven't noticed previously because -flto was hiding it somehow.

The code is confused, PT_MSR isn't a gpr, instead it's in
uc_regs->gregs, so fix it.
