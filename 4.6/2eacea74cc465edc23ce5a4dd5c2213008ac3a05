orangefs: strncpy -> strscpy

It would have been possible for a rogue client-core to send in a symlink
target which is not NUL terminated. This returns EIO if the client-core
gives us corrupt data.

Leave debugfs and superblock code as is for now.

Other dcache.c and namei.c strncpy instances are safe because
ORANGEFS_NAME_MAX = NAME_MAX + 1; there is always enough space for a
name plus a NUL byte.
