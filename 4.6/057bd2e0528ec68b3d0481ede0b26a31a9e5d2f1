PCI: Add pci_ops.{add,remove}_bus() callbacks

Add pci_ops.{add,remove}_bus() callbacks, which will be called on every
newly created bus and when a bus is being removed, respectively.  This can
be used by drivers to implement driver-specific initialization and teardown
of the bus, in addition to the architecture-specifics implemented by the
pcibios_add_bus() and the pcibios_remove_bus() functions.
