arm64: kvm: deal with kernel symbols outside of linear mapping

KVM on arm64 uses a fixed offset between the linear mapping at EL1 and
the HYP mapping at EL2. Before we can move the kernel virtual mapping
out of the linear mapping, we have to make sure that references to kernel
symbols that are accessed via the HYP mapping are translated to their
linear equivalent.
