drm: Add functions to setup/tear down drm_events.

An attempt at not spreading out the file_priv->event_space stuff out
quite so far and wide.  And I think fixes something in ipp_get_event()
that is broken (or if they are doing something more weird/subtle, then
breaks it in a fun way).

Based upon a patch from Rob Clark, rebased and polished.

v2: Spelling fixes (Alex).
