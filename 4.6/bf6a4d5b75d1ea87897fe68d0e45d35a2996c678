powerpc: Add the ability to save VSX without giving it up

This patch adds the ability to be able to save the VSX registers to the
thread struct without giving up (disabling the facility) next time the
process returns to userspace.

This patch builds on a previous optimisation for the FPU and VEC registers
in the thread copy path to avoid a possibly pointless reload of VSX state.
