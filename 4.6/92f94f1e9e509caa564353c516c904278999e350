KVM: MMU: rename has_wrprotected_page to mmu_gfn_lpage_is_disallowed

kvm_lpage_info->write_count is used to detect if the large page mapping
for the gfn on the specified level is allowed, rename it to disallow_lpage
to reflect its purpose, also we rename has_wrprotected_page() to
mmu_gfn_lpage_is_disallowed() to make the code more clearer

Later we will extend this mechanism for page tracking: if the gfn is
tracked then large mapping for that gfn on any level is not allowed.
The new name is more straightforward
