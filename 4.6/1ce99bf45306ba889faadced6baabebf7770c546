arm64/vmlinux.lds.S: Handle .init.rodata.xxx and .init.bss sections

The EFI stub is typically built into the decompressor (x86, ARM) so none
of its symbols are annotated as __init. However, on arm64, the stub is
linked into the kernel proper, and the code is __init annotated at the
section level by prepending all names of SHF_ALLOC sections with '.init'.

This results in section names like .init.rodata.str1.8 (for string literals)
and .init.bss (which is tiny), both of which can be moved into the .init.data
output section.
