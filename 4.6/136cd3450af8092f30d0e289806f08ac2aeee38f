powerpc/module: Only try to generate the ftrace_caller() stub once

Currently we generate the module stub for ftrace_caller() at the bottom
of apply_relocate_add(). However apply_relocate_add() is potentially
called more than once per module, which means we will try to generate
the ftrace_caller() stub multiple times.

Although the current code deals with that correctly, ie. it only
generates a stub the first time, it would be clearer to only try to
generate the stub once.

Note also on first reading it may appear that we generate a different
stub for each section that requires relocation, but that is not the
case. The code in stub_for_addr() that searches for an existing stub
uses sechdrs[me->arch.stubs_section], ie. the single stub section for
this module.

A cleaner approach is to only generate the ftrace_caller() stub once,
from module_finalize(). Although the original code didn't check to see
if the stub was actually generated correctly, it seems prudent to add a
check, so do that. And an additional benefit is we can clean the ifdefs
up a little.

Finally we must propagate the const'ness of some of the pointers passed
to module_finalize(), but that is also an improvement.
