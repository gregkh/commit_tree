PCI: imx6: Move link up check into imx6_pcie_wait_for_link()

imx6_pcie_link_up() previously used usleep_range() to wait for the link to
come up.  Since it may be called while holding the config spinlock, the
sleep causes a "BUG: scheduling while atomic" error.

Instead of waiting for the link to come up in imx6_pcie_link_up(), do the
waiting in imx6_pcie_wait_for_link(), where we're not holding a lock and
sleeping is allowed.
