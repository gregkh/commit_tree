staging: lustre: make LNet use lprocfs_call_handler

Sometime ago a patch was submitted to duplicate the
proc_call_handler code in the LNet layer. This was
due to the thinking libcfs was not used by the LNet
layer. This was a wrong assumption so lets make LNet
use the lprocfs_call_handler from the libcfs layer.
