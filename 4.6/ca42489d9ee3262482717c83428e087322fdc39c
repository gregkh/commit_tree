intel_idle: Avoid a double free of the per-CPU data.

The helper function, intel_idle_cpuidle_devices_uninit, frees the
globally allocated per-CPU data.  However, this function is invoked
from the hot plug notifier callback at a time when freeing that data
is not safe.

If the call to cpuidle_register_driver() should fail (say, due to lack
of memory), then the driver will free its per-CPU region.  On the
*next* CPU_ONLINE event, the driver will happily use the region again
and even free it again if the failure repeats.

This patch fixes the issue by moving the call to free_percpu() outside
of the helper function at the two call sites that actually need to
free the per-CPU data.
