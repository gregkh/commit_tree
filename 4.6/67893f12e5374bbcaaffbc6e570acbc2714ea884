gfs2: avoid uninitialized variable warning

We get a bogus warning about a potential uninitialized variable
use in gfs2, because the compiler does not figure out that we
never use the leaf number if get_leaf_nr() returns an error:

fs/gfs2/dir.c: In function 'get_first_leaf':
fs/gfs2/dir.c:802:9: warning: 'leaf_no' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
fs/gfs2/dir.c: In function 'dir_split_leaf':
fs/gfs2/dir.c:1021:8: warning: 'leaf_no' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Changing the 'if (!error)' to 'if (!IS_ERR_VALUE(error))' is
sufficient to let gcc understand that this is exactly the same
condition as in IS_ERR() so it can optimize the code path enough
to understand it.
