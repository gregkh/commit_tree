arm64: KVM: vgic-v3: Only wipe LRs on vcpu exit

So far, we're always writing all possible LRs, setting the empty
ones with a zero value. This is obvious doing a low of work for
nothing, and we're better off clearing those we've actually
dirtied on the exit path (it is very rare to inject more than one
interrupt at a time anyway).
