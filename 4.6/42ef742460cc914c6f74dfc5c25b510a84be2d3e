ARM: imx_v6_v7_defconfig: enable useful configurations for Vybrid

Enable configuration options useful for Vybrid:
- NFC NAND driver
- USB dual-role controller support
- FTM PWM driver
- DSPI SPI driver
- Colibri VF50 Touchscreen support.

Beside that, enable useful configurations such as IIO hwmon support
(used in i.MX 23/28, patch pending for Vybrid), PWM LED support and
CPU idle support.

Regenerated config using savedefconfig (which removes some configs
which are now enabled by default).
