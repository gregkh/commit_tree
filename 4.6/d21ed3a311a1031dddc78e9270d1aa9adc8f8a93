net/mlx4_en: Split SW RX dropped counter per RX ring

Count SW packet drops per RX ring instead of a global counter. This
will allow monitoring the number of rx drops per ring.

In addition, SW rx_dropped counter was overwritten by HW rx_dropped
counter, sum both of them instead to show the accurate value.
