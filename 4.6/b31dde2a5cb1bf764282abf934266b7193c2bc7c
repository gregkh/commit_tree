crypto: ccp - Don't assume export/import areas are aligned

Use a local variable for the exported and imported state so that
alignment is not an issue. On export, set a local variable from the
request context and then memcpy the contents of the local variable to
the export memory area. On import, memcpy the import memory area into
a local variable and then use the local variable to set the request
context.
