vxlan: fix populating tclass in vxlan6_get_route

Jiri mentioned that flowi6_tos of struct flowi6 is never used/read
anywhere. In fact, rest of the kernel uses the flowi6's flowlabel,
where the traffic class _and_ the flowlabel (aka flowinfo) is encoded.

For example, for policy routing, fib6_rule_match() uses ip6_tclass()
that is applied on the flowlabel member for matching on tclass. Similar
fix is needed for geneve, where flowi6_tos is set as well. Installing
a v6 blackhole rule that f.e. matches on tos is now working with vxlan.
