mmc: sdhci-acpi: Reduce Baytrail eMMC/SD/SDIO hangs

Baytrail eMMC/SD/SDIO host controllers have been known to
hang.  A change to a hardware setting has been found to
reduce the occurrence of such hangs.  This patch ensures
the correct setting.

This patch applies cleanly to v4.4+.  It could go to
earlier kernels also, so I will send backports to the
stable list in due course.
