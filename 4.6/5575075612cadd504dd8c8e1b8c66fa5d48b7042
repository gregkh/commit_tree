mtd: atmel_nand: Support PMECC on SAMA5D2

Starting with the SAMA5D2, there is a new revision of the Atmel PMECC
controller that can correct 32 bits in each sector. This controller is
not 100% compatible with the previous revision that corrected a maximum
of 24 bits by sector, as some register addresses overlap.

Using information from the device tree, we can configure the driver to
work with both versions.
