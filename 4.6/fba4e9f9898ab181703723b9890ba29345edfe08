powerpc/fsl/dts: Add "jedec,spi-nor" flash compatible

Starting with commit <8947e396a829> ("Documentation: dt: mtd:
replace "nor-jedec" binding with "jedec, spi-nor"") we have
"jedec,spi-nor" binding indicating support for JEDEC identification.

Use it for all flashes that are supposed to support READ ID op
according to the datasheets.
