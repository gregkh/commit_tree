firewire: ohci: propagate return code from soft_reset to probe and resume

software_reset() may fail
  - due to unresponsive chip with -EBUSY (-16), or
  - due to ejected or unseated card with -ENODEV (-19).
Let the PCI probe and resume routines log the actual error code instead
of hardwired -EBUSY.
