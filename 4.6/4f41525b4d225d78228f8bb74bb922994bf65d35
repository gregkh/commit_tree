ARM: dts: vf-colibri: remove regulator container node

Drop the fake simple-bus container 'regulators' and put the
regulators directly under the root node. This also makes the
artificial 'reg' properties superfluous. While at it, remove
the unnecessary regulator-always-on property and name the
regulators according to schematics.
