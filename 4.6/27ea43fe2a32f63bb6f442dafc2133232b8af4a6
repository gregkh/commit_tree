nbd: Fix debugfs error handling

Static checker complains about the implemented error handling. It is
indeed wrong. We don't care about the return values of created debugfs
files.

We only have to check the return values of created dirs for NULL
pointer. If we use a null pointer as parent directory for files, this
may lead to debugfs files in wrong places.
