cgroup: separate out interface file creation from css creation

Currently, interface files are created when a css is created depending
on whether @visible is set.  This patch separates out the two into
separate steps to help code refactoring and eventually allow cgroups
which aren't visible through cgroup fs.

Move css_populate_dir() out of create_css() and drop @visible.  While
at it, rename the function to css_create() for consistency.
