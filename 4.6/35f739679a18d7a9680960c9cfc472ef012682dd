iio: dac: mcp4725: Add basic support for MCP4726

MCP4726 is a single channel 12-bit DAC.  We can support MCP4726 with
a little changes to mcp4725 driver.  In power-down mode, they have
different selection of VOUT pull-down registers.

MCP4726 also has features:
 - Output gain options: 1x, 2x
 - Voltage reference selection: VDD, VREF (Unbuffered or Buffered)

But these are not supported in this change. (1x gain, VDD is selected)
