ARM: 8503/1: clk_register_clkdev: remove format string interface

Many callers either use NULL or const strings for the third argument of
clk_register_clkdev. For those that do not and use a non-const string,
this is a risk for format strings being accidentally processed (for
example in device names). As this interface is already used as if it
weren't a format string (prints nothing when NULL), and there are zero
users of the format strings, remove the format string interface to make
sure format strings will not leak into the clkdev.

$ git grep '\bclk_register_clkdev\b' | grep % | wc -l
0

Unfortunately, all the internals expect a va_list even though they treat
a NULL format string as special. To deal with this, we must pass either
(..., "%s", string) or (..., NULL) so that a the va_list will be created
correctly (passing the name as an argument, not as a format string).
