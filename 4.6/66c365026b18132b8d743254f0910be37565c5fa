staging: comedi: COMEDI_BUFINFO: force bytes_read or bytes_written to 0

The `COMEDI_BUFINFO` ioctl is used to advance the current position in
the buffer by a specified amount (which can be 0) and get the new
position.  On input, the `bytes_read` member of `struct comedi_bufinfo`
specifies the amount to advance the "read" position for an asynchronous
command in the "read" direction, and the `bytes_written` member
specifies the amount to advance the "write" position for a command in
the "write" direction.  The handler `do_bufinfo_ioctl()` may adjust
these by the amount the position is actually advanced before copying
them back to the user.  Currently, it ignores the specified `bytes_read`
value for a command in the "write" direction, and ignores the specified
`bytes_written` for a command in the "read" direction, so the values
copied back to the user are unchanged.  Change it to force the ignored
value to 0 before copying the values back to the user.
