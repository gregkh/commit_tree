staging/rdma/hfi1: Fix missing firmware NULL dereference

The gen3 bump code must mark a firmware download failure as fatal.
Otherwise a later load attempt will fail with a NULL dereference.

Also:
o Only do a firmware back-off for RTL.  There are no alternates for
  FPGA or simulation.
o Rearrange OS firmware request order to match what is actually
  loaded.  This results in more coherent informational messages
  in the case of missing firmware.
