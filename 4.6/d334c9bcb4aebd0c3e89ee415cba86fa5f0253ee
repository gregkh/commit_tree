mm: memcontrol: cleanup css_reset callback

- Do not take memcg_limit_mutex for resetting limits - the cgroup cannot
  be altered from userspace anymore, so no need to protect them.

- Use plain page_counter_limit() for resetting ->memory and ->memsw
  limits instead of mem_cgrouop_resize_* helpers - we enlarge the limits,
  so no need in special handling.

- Reset ->swap and ->tcpmem limits as well.
