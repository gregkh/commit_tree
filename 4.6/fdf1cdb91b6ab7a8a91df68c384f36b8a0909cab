mm: remove unnecessary uses of lock_page_memcg()

There are several users that nest lock_page_memcg() inside lock_page()
to prevent page->mem_cgroup from changing.  But the page lock prevents
pages from moving between cgroups, so that is unnecessary overhead.

Remove lock_page_memcg() in contexts with locked contexts and fix the
debug code in the page stat functions to be okay with the page lock.
