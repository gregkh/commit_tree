driver-core: platform: probe of-devices only using list of compatibles

There are several indications that make a platform device match a
platform driver. For devices that are instantiated by a device tree
matching by name, id table or acpi mechanisms doesn't make sense and
might result in surprising effects. So limit matching to use the
driver's of_match_table for these.
