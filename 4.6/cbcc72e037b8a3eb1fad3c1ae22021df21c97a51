drivers/perf: arm-pmu: fix RCU usage on pmu resume from low-power

Commit da4e4f18afe0 ("drivers/perf: arm_pmu: implement CPU_PM notifier")
added code in the arm perf infrastructure that allows the kernel to
save/restore perf counters whenever the CPU enters a low-power
state. The kernel saves/restores the counters for each active event
through the armpmu_{stop/start} ARM pmu API, so that the low-power state
enter/exit cycle is emulated through pmu start/stop operations for each
event in use.

However, calling armpmu_start() for each active event on power up
executes code that requires RCU locking (perf_event_update_userpage())
to be functional, so, given that the core may call the CPU_PM notifiers
while running the idle thread in an quiescent RCU state this is not
allowed as detected through the following splat when kernel is run with
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING enabled:

This patch wraps the armpmu_start() call (that indirectly calls
perf_event_update_userpage()) on CPU_PM notifier power state exit (or
failed entry) within the RCU_NONIDLE() macro so that the RCU subsystem
is made aware the calling cpu is not idle from an RCU perspective for
the armpmu_start() call duration, therefore fixing the issue.
