mm: exclude ZONE_DEVICE from GFP_ZONE_TABLE

ZONE_DEVICE (merged in 4.3) and ZONE_CMA (proposed) are examples of new
mm zones that are bumping up against the current maximum limit of 4
zones, i.e.  2 bits in page->flags for the GFP_ZONE_TABLE.

The GFP_ZONE_TABLE poses an interesting constraint since
include/linux/gfp.h gets included by the 32-bit portion of a 64-bit
build.  We need to be careful to only build the table for zones that
have a corresponding gfp_t flag.  GFP_ZONES_SHIFT is introduced for this
purpose.  This patch does not attempt to solve the problem of adding a
new zone that also has a corresponding GFP_ flag.

Vlastimil points out that ZONE_DEVICE, by depending on x86_64 and
SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP implies that SECTIONS_WIDTH is zero.  In other words
even though ZONE_DEVICE does not fit in GFP_ZONE_TABLE it is free to
consume another bit in page->flags (expand ZONES_WIDTH) with room to
spare.
