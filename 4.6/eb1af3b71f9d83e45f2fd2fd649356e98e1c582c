EDAC/sb_edac: Fix computation of channel address

Large memory Haswell-EX systems with multiple DIMMs per channel were
sometimes reporting the wrong DIMM.

Found three problems:

 1) Debug printouts for socket and channel interleave were not interpreting
    the register fields correctly. The socket interleave field is a 2^X
    value (0=1, 1=2, 2=4, 3=8). The channel interleave is X+1 (0=1, 1=2,
    2=3. 3=4).

 2) Actual use of the socket interleave value didn't interpret as 2^X

 3) Conversion of address to channel address was complicated, and wrong.
