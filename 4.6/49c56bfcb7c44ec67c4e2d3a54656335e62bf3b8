Revert "drivers/tty/serial: make 8250/8250_ingenic.c explicitly non-modular"

This reverts commit cafe1ac64023  ("drivers/tty: make serial
8250_ingenic.c explicitly non-modular"), which attempted to remove dead
code but did not have the desired effect when the main 8250 driver was
a loadable module itself.

This would normally result in a link error, but as the entire
drivers/tty/serial/8250/ directory is only entered when CONFIG_SERIAL_8250
is set, we never notice that the driver does not get built in this
configuration.
