VSOCK: do not disconnect socket when peer has shutdown SEND only

The peer may be expecting a reply having sent a request and then done a
shutdown(SHUT_WR), so tearing down the whole socket at this point seems
wrong and breaks for me with a client which does a SHUT_WR.

Looking at other socket family's stream_recvmsg callbacks doing a shutdown
here does not seem to be the norm and removing it does not seem to have
had any adverse effects that I can see.

I'm using Stefan's RFC virtio transport patches, I'm unsure of the impact
on the vmci transport.
