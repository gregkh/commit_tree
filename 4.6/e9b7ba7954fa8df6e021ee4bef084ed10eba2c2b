mfd: as3711: Set regmap config reg counts properly

Regmap config max_register field should contain number of
device last register, however num_reg_defaults_raw field
should be set to register count instead
(usually one register more than max_register).

as3711 driver had both of these fields set to the same value,
fix this by introducing separate defines for max register
number and total count of registers.
