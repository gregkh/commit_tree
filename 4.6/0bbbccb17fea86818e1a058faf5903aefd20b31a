btrfs: introduce key type for persistent temporary items

The number of distinct key types is not that big that we could waste one
for something new we want to store in the tree. We'll introduce a new
name for an existing key value and use the objectid for further
extension.  The victim is the BTRFS_BALANCE_ITEM_KEY (248).

The nature of the balance status item is a good example of the temporary
item. It exists from beginning of the balance, keeps the status until it
finishes.
