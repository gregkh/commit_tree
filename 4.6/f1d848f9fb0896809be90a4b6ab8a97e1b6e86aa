ahci: Convert driver to use modern PM hooks

In order to add support for runtime PM to the ahci driver we first need to
convert the driver to use modern non-legacy system suspend hooks. There
should be no functional changes.

tj: Updated .driver.pm init for older compilers as suggested by Andy
    and Chrsitoph.
