perf hists: Fix determination of a callchain node's childlessness

The 4b3a3212233a ("perf hists browser: Support flat callchains") commit
over-aggressively tried to optimize callchain_node__init_have_children().

That lead to --tui mode not allowing to expand call chain elements if a
call chain element had only one parent. That's why --inverted callgraphs
looked halfway sane, but plain ones didn't.

Revert that individual optimization, it wasn't really related to the
rest of the commit.
