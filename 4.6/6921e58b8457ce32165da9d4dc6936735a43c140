ARM: dts: dra7: Use "syscon-phy-power" and "syscon-pcs" in PCIe PHY node

Add "syscon-phy-power" property and "syscon-pcs" property which can
be used to perform the control module initializations and remove
the deprecated "ctrl-module" property from PCIe PHY dt nodes.

Phandle to "sysclk" clock node is also added to the PCIe PHY node
since some of the syscon initializations is based on system clock
frequency.

Since "omap_control_pcie1phy" and "omap_control_pcie2phy" devicetree
nodes are no longer used, remove it.
