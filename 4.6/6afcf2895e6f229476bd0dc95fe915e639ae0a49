mm,oom: make oom_killer_disable() killable

While oom_killer_disable() is called by freeze_processes() after all
user threads except the current thread are frozen, it is possible that
kernel threads invoke the OOM killer and sends SIGKILL to the current
thread due to sharing the thawed victim's memory.  Therefore, checking
for SIGKILL is preferable than TIF_MEMDIE.
