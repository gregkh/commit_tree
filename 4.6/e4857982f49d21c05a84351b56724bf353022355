cgroup: use css_set->mg_dst_cgrp for the migration target cgroup

Migration can be multi-target on the default hierarchy when a
controller is enabled - processes belonging to each child cgroup have
to be moved to the child cgroup itself to refresh css association.

This isn't a problem for cgroup_migrate_add_src() as each source
css_set still maps to single source and target cgroups; however,
cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst() is called once after all source css_sets
are added and thus might not have a single destination cgroup.  This
is currently worked around by specifying NULL for @dst_cgrp and using
the source's default cgroup as destination as the only multi-target
migration in use is self-targetting.  While this works, it's subtle
and clunky.

As all taget cgroups are already specified while preparing the source
css_sets, this clunkiness can easily be removed by recording the
target cgroup in each source css_set.  This patch adds
css_set->mg_dst_cgrp which is recorded on cgroup_migrate_src() and
used by cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst().  This also makes migration code
ready for arbitrary multi-target migration.
