ncr5380: Forget aborted commands

The list structures and related logic used in the NCR5380 driver mean that
a command cannot be queued twice (i.e. can't appear on more than one queue
and can't appear on the same queue more than once).

The abort handler must forget the command so that the mid-layer can re-use
it. E.g. the ML may send it back to the LLD via via scsi_eh_get_sense().

Fix this and also fix two error paths, so that commands get forgotten iff
completed.
