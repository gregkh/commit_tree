ALSA: hda - Fix regression of monitor_present flag in eld proc file

The commit [bd48128539ab: ALSA: hda - Fix forgotten HDMI
monitor_present update] covered the missing update of monitor_present
flag, but this caused a regression for devices without the i915 eld
notifier.  Since the old code supposed that pin_eld->monitor_present
was updated by the caller side, the hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs()
doesn't update the temporary eld->monitor_present but only
pin_eld->monitor_present, which is now overridden in update_eld().

The fix is to update pin_eld->monitor_present as well before calling
update_eld().

Note that this may still leave monitor_present flag in an inconsistent
state when the driver repolls, but this is at least the old behavior.
More proper fix will follow in the later patch.
