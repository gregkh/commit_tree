i2c: qup: Add V2 tags support

QUP from version 2.1.1 onwards, supports a new format of
i2c command tags. Tag codes instructs the controller to
perform a operation like read/write. This new tagging version
supports bam dma and transfers of more than 256 bytes without 'stop'
in between. Adding the support for the same.

For each block a data_write/read tag and data_len tag is added to
the output fifo. For the final block of data write_stop/read_stop
tag is used.
