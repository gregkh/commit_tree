mm: Add vm_insert_pfn_prot()

The x86 vvar vma contains pages with differing cacheability
flags.  x86 currently implements this by manually inserting all
the ptes using (io_)remap_pfn_range when the vma is set up.

x86 wants to move to using .fault with VM_FAULT_NOPAGE to set up
the mappings as needed.  The correct API to use to insert a pfn
in .fault is vm_insert_pfn(), but vm_insert_pfn() can't override the
vma's cache mode, and the HPET page in particular needs to be
uncached despite the fact that the rest of the VMA is cached.

Add vm_insert_pfn_prot() to support varying cacheability within
the same non-COW VMA in a more sane manner.

x86 could alternatively use multiple VMAs, but that's messy,
would break CRIU, and would create unnecessary VMAs that would
waste memory.
