clk: bcm2835: fix check of error code returned by devm_ioremap_resource()

The change fixes potential oops while accessing iomem on invalid
address, if devm_ioremap_resource() fails due to some reason.

The devm_ioremap_resource() function returns ERR_PTR() and never
returns NULL, which makes useless a following check for NULL.
