mac80211: remove ieee80211_get_key_tx_seq/ieee80211_set_key_tx_seq

Since the PNs of all the tx keys are now tracked in the public
part of the key struct (with atomic counter), we no longer
need these functions.

dvm and vt665{5,6} are currently the only users of these functions,
so update them accordingly.
