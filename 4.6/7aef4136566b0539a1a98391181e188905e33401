powerpc32: rewrite csum_partial_copy_generic() based on copy_tofrom_user()

csum_partial_copy_generic() does the same as copy_tofrom_user and also
calculates the checksum during the copy. Unlike copy_tofrom_user(),
the existing version of csum_partial_copy_generic() doesn't take
benefit of the cache.

This patch is a rewrite of csum_partial_copy_generic() based on
copy_tofrom_user().
The previous version of csum_partial_copy_generic() was handling
errors. Now we have the checksum wrapper functions to handle the error
case like in powerpc64 so we can make the error case simple:
just return -EFAULT.
copy_tofrom_user() only has r12 available => we use it for the
checksum r7 and r8 which contains pointers to error feedback are used,
so we stack them.

On a TCP benchmark using socklib on the loopback interface on which
checksum offload and scatter/gather have been deactivated, we get
about 20% performance increase.
