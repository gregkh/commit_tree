cpufreq: governor: Drop unnecessary checks from show() and store()

The show() and store() routines in the cpufreq-governor core don't need
to check if the struct governor_attr they want to use really provides
the callbacks they need as expected (if that's not the case, it means a
bug in the code anyway), so change them to avoid doing that.

Also change the error value to -EBUSY, if the governor is getting
removed and we aren't allowed to store any more changes.
