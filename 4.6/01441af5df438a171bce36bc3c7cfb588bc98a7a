perf hists: Factor output_resort from hists__output_resort

Currently hists__output_resort() depends on hists based on hists_evsel
struct, but we need to be able to sort common hists as well.

Cutting out the sorting base sorting code into output_resort
function, so it can be reused in following patch.
