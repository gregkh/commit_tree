ubsan: fix tree-wide -Wmaybe-uninitialized false positives

-fsanitize=* options makes GCC less smart than usual and increase number
of 'maybe-uninitialized' false-positives. So this patch does two things:

 * Add -Wno-maybe-uninitialized to CFLAGS_UBSAN which will disable all
   such warnings for instrumented files.

 * Remove CONFIG_UBSAN_SANITIZE_ALL from all[yes|mod]config builds. So
   the all[yes|mod]config build goes without -fsanitize=* and still with
   -Wmaybe-uninitialized.
