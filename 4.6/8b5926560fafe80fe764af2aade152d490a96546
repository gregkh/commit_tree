mm: memcontrol: clarify the uncharge_list() loop

uncharge_list() does an unusual list walk because the function can take
regular lists with dedicated list_heads as well as singleton lists where
a single page is passed via the page->lru list node.

This can sometimes lead to confusion as well as suggestions to replace
the loop with a list_for_each_entry(), which wouldn't work.
