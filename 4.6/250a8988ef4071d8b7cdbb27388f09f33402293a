lkdtm: Update WRITE_AFTER_FREE test

The SLUB allocator may use the first word of a freed block to store the
freelist information. This may make it harder to test poisoning
features. Change the WRITE_AFTER_FREE test to better match what
the READ_AFTER_FREE test does and also print out a big more information.
