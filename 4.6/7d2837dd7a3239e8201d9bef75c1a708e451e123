bnxt_en: Setup multicast properly after resetting device.

The multicast/all-multicast internal flags are not properly restored
after device reset.  This could lead to unreliable multicast operations
after an ethtool configuration change for example.

Call bnxt_mc_list_updated() and setup the vnic->mask in bnxt_init_chip()
to fix the issue.
