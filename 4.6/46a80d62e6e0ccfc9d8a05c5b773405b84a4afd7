IB/qib, staging/rdma/hfi1: add s_hlock for use in post send

This patch adds an additional lock to reduce contention on the s_lock.

This lock is used in post_send() so that the post_send is not
serialized with the send engine and other send related processing.

To do this the s_next_psn is now maintained on post_send() while
post_send() related fields are moved to a new cache line.  There is
an s_avail maintained for the post_send() to mitigate trading cache
lines with the send engine.  The lock is released/acquired around
releasing the just built packet to the egress mechanism.
