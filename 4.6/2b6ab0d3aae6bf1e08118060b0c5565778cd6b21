net: cls_u32: move TC offload feature bit into cls_u32 offload logic

In the original series drivers would get offload requests for cls_u32
rules even if the feature bit is disabled. This meant the driver had
to do a boiler plate check on the feature bit before adding/deleting
the rule.

This patch lifts the check into the core code and removes it from the
driver specific case.
