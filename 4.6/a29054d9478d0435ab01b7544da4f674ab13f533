tracing: Fix crash from reading trace_pipe with sendfile

If tracing contains data and the trace_pipe file is read with sendfile(),
then it can trigger a NULL pointer dereference and various BUG_ON within the
VM code.

There's a patch to fix this in the splice_to_pipe() code, but it's also a
good idea to not let that happen from trace_pipe either.
