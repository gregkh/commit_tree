gianfar: Map head TxBD first

Move the mapping of the head BD before the mapping of fragments.
The TOE (h/w offload) decision logic block can be also moved up
(as the TOE flag belongs to the head BD), resulting in more
localized code (TOE logic vs BD mapping code blocks).
Note that, for this h/w, the R (status) bit for the head BD of a S/G
frame needs to be written last for a reliable transmission.
For the fragmented skb case, a local variable is used to temporarily
store the status info of the first BD, replacing a BD status read.
A merge of 2 "if(do_tstamp)" blocks was also possible.
