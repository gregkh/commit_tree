qed: Handle possible race in SB config

Due to HW design, some of the memories are wide-bus and access to those
needs to be sequentialized on a per-HW-block level; Read/write to a
given HW-block might break other read/write to wide-bus memory done at
~same time.

Status blocks initialization in CAU is done into such a wide-bus memory.
This moves the initialization into using DMAE which is guaranteed to be
safe to use on such memories.
