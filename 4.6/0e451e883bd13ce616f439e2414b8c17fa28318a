IB/mlx4: Add support for the don't trap rule

Add support for receiving multicast/unicast traffic with
the don't trap rule.

Sniffing these packets requires a flow steering rule of type NORMAL
at priority 0 with flag IB_FLOW_ATTR_FLAGS_DONT_TRAP set.
Choosing between multicast or unicast is done via ethernet L2 dest_mac
mask and value:
- If mask is all zeros - unicast and multicast are set.
- If mask non zero - only mask with multicast bit 1 and rest 0 is
                     supported, the mac value will choose if it is
                     multicast or unicast rule.

If the mask multicast bit is on and some other bits are on too, it means
a request for specific multicast or unicast, this is not supported,
either receive all multicast or all unicast.

Only when limitations are met registered QP will receive requested type
but other QPs can receive same traffic if registered for it.
Otherwise, if limitations are not met, an error will be returned.

Limitations:
- Rule must be with priority 0.
- A0 mode is not supported.
- Sniffer QP cannot appear in any other flow steering rule.
