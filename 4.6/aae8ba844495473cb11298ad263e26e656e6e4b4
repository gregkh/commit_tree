drm/i915: Make sure pipe interrupts are processed before turning off power well on BDW+

Starting from BDW the DE_PIPE interrupts for pipe B and C belong to the
relevant display power well. So we should make sure we've finished
processing them before turning off the power well.

The pipe interrupts shouldn't really happen at this point anymore since
we've already shut down the planes/pipes/whatnot, but being a bit
paranoid shouldn't hurt.
