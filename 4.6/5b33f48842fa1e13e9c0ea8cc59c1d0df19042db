net/flower: Introduce hardware offload support

This patch is based on a patch made by John Fastabend.
It adds support for offloading cls_flower.
when NETIF_F_HW_TC is on:
  flags = 0       => Rule will be processed twice - by hardware, and if
                     still relevant, by software.
  flags = SKIP_HW => Rull will be processed by software only

If hardware fail/not capabale to apply the rule, operation will NOT
fail. Filter will be processed by SW only.
