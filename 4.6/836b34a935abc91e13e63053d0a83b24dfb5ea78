ALSA: usb-audio: Fix double-free in error paths after snd_usb_add_audio_stream() call

create_fixed_stream_quirk(), snd_usb_parse_audio_interface() and
create_uaxx_quirk() functions allocate the audioformat object by themselves
and free it upon error before returning. However, once the object is linked
to a stream, it's freed again in snd_usb_audio_pcm_free(), thus it'll be
double-freed, eventually resulting in a memory corruption.

This patch fixes these failures in the error paths by unlinking the audioformat
object before freeing it.

Based on a patch by Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

[Note for stable backports:
 this patch requires the commit 902eb7fd1e4a ('ALSA: usb-audio: Minor
 code cleanup in create_fixed_stream_quirk()')]
