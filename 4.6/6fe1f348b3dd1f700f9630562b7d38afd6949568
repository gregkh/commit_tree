sched/cgroup: Fix cgroup entity load tracking tear-down

When a cgroup's CPU runqueue is destroyed, it should remove its
remaining load accounting from its parent cgroup.

The current site for doing so it unsuited because its far too late and
unordered against other cgroup removal (->css_free() will be, but we're also
in an RCU callback).

Put it in the ->css_offline() callback, which is the start of cgroup
destruction, right after the group has been made unavailable to
userspace. The ->css_offline() callbacks are called in hierarchical order
after the following v4.4 commit:

  aa226ff4a1ce ("cgroup: make sure a parent css isn't offlined before its children")
