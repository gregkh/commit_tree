arm64: prefetch: add alternative pattern for CPUs without a prefetcher

Most CPUs have a hardware prefetcher which generally performs better
without explicit prefetch instructions issued by software, however
some CPUs (e.g. Cavium ThunderX) rely solely on explicit prefetch
instructions.

This patch adds an alternative pattern (ARM64_HAS_NO_HW_PREFETCH) to
allow our library code to make use of explicit prefetch instructions
during things like copy routines only when the CPU does not have the
capability to perform the prefetching itself.
