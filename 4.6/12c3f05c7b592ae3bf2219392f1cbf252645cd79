xfs: fix up inode32/64 (re)mount handling

inode32/inode64 allocator behavior with respect to mount, remount
and growfs is a little tricky.

The inode32 mount option should only enable the inode32 allocator
heuristics if the filesystem is large enough for 64-bit inodes to
exist.  Today, it has this behavior on the initial mount, but a
remount with inode32 unconditionally changes the allocation
heuristics, even for a small fs.

Also, an inode32 mounted small filesystem should transition to the
inode32 allocator if the filesystem is subsequently grown to a
sufficient size.  Today that does not happen.

This patch consolidates xfs_set_inode32 and xfs_set_inode64 into a
single new function, and moves the "is the maximum inode number big
enough to matter" test into that function, so it doesn't rely on the
caller to get it right - which remount did not do, previously.
