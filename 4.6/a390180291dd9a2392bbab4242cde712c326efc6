libnvdimm, pfn: fix nvdimm_namespace_add_poison() vs section alignment

When section alignment padding is in effect we need to shift / truncate
the range that is queried for poison by the 'start_pad' or 'end_trunc'
reservations.

It's easiest if we just pass in an adjusted resource range rather than
deriving it from the passed in namespace.  With the resource range
resolution pushed out to the caller we can also push the
namespace-to-region lookup to the caller and drop the implicit pmem-type
assumption about the passed in namespace object.
