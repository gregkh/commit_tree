ocfs2: solve a problem of crossing the boundary in updating backups

In update_backups() there exists a problem of crossing the boundary as
follows:

we assume that lun will be resized to 1TB(cluster_size is 32kb), it will
include 0~33554431 cluster, in update_backups func, it will backup super
block in location of 1TB which is the 33554432th cluster, so the
phenomenon of crossing the boundary happens.
