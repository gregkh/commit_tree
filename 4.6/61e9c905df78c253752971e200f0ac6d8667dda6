misc: mic: Enable VOP host side functionality

This patch moves virtio functionality from the MIC host driver into a
separate hardware independent Virtio Over PCIe (VOP) driver. This
functionality was introduced in commit f69bcbf3b4c4 ("Intel MIC Host
Driver Changes for Virtio Devices.") in
drivers/misc/mic/host/mic_virtio.c. Apart from being moved into a
separate driver the functionality is essentially unchanged. See the
above mentioned commit for a description of this functionality.
