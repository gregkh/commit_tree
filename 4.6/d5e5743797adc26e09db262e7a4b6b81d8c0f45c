arm64: kaslr: use callee saved register to preserve SCTLR across C call

The KASLR code incorrectly expects the contents of x18 to be preserved
across a call into C code, and uses it to stash the contents of SCTLR_EL1
before enabling the MMU. If the MMU needs to be disabled again to create
the randomized kernel mapping, x18 is written back to SCTLR_EL1, which is
likely to crash the system if x18 has been clobbered by kasan_early_init()
or kaslr_early_init(). So use x22 instead, which is not in use so far in
head.S
