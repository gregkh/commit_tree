[media] media.h: always start with 1 for the audio entities

Start the audio defines with BASE + 0x03001 instead of 0x03000. This is consistent
with the other defines, and I think it is good practice not to start with 0, just in
case we want to do something like (id & 0xfff) in the future and treat the value 0
as a special case.
