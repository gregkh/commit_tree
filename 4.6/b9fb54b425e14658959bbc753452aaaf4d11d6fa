aacraid: Fix character device re-initialization

During EEH PCI hotplug activity kernel unloads and loads the driver,
causing character device to be unregistered(aac_remove_one).When the
driver is loaded back using aac_probe_one the character device needs
to be registered again for the AIF management tools to work.

Fixed by adding code to register character device in aac_probe_one if
it is unregistered in aac_remove_one.
