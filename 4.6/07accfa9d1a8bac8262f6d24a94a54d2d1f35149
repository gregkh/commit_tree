libnvdimm: Fix security issue with DSM IOCTL.

Code attempts to prevent certain IOCTL DSM from being called
when device is opened read only.  This security feature can
be trivially overcome by changing the size portion of the
ioctl_command which isn't used.

Check only the _IOC_NR (i.e. the command).
