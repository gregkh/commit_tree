s390/dasd: Refactor dasd format functions

Prepare for new format checking function by renaming functions and
moving reusable code to separate functions:

- Move sanity checks into a new function and make it reusable.
- Move common format code to a new function called
  dasd_eckd_format_process_data.
- Create the generic function dasd_eckd_format_build_ccw_req, which
  itself will then decide what ccw request is being built according to
  the input data. (with upcoming functionality).
