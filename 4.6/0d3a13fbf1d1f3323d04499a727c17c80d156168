cxl: Remove cxl_get_phys_dev() kernel API

The cxl_get_phys_dev() API returns a struct device pointer which could
belong to either a struct pci_dev (bare-metal) or platform_device
(powerVM). To avoid potential problems in drivers, remove that API. It
was introduced to allow drivers to read the VPD of the adapter, but
the cxl driver now provides the cxl_pci_read_adapter_vpd() API for
that purpose.
