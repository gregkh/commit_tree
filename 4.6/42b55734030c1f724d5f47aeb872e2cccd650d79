efi/arm64: Check for h/w support before booting a >4 KB granular kernel

A kernel built with support for a page size that is not supported by the
hardware it runs on cannot boot to a state where it can inform the user
about the failure.

If we happen to be booting via UEFI, we can fail gracefully so check
if the currently configured page size is supported by the hardware before
entering the kernel proper. Note that UEFI mandates support for 4 KB pages,
so in that case, no check is needed.
