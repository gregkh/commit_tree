nbd: Create size change events for userspace

The userspace needs to know when nbd devices are ready for use.
Currently no events are created for the userspace which doesn't work for
systemd.

See the discussion here: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/358

This patch uses a central point to setup the nbd-internal sizes. A ioctl
to set a size does not lead to a visible size change. The size of the
block device will be kept at 0 until nbd is connected. As soon as it
connects, the size will be changed to the real value and a uevent is
created. When disconnecting, the blockdevice is set to 0 size and
another uevent is generated.
