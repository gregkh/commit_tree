IB/rdmavt: Clean up comments and add more documentation

Add, remove, and otherwise clean up existing comments that are leftover
from the initial code postings of rdmavt. Many of the comments were added
to provide an idea on the direction we were thinking of going. Now that the
design is solidified make a pass over and clean everything up. Also add
details where lacking.

Ensure all non static functions have nano comments.
