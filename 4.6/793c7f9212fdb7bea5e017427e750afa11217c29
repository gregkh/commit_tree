spi: imx: only do necessary changes to ECSPIx_CONFIGREG

If the SPI chip select (CS) for a dedicated channel is done manually by
the used higher device driver, the CS may be active while writing to
ECSPIx_CONFIGREG. To prevent unwanted clock edges when selecting
the clock mode,  only do the necessary changes to the i.MX SPI
configuration register and leave not selected channels untouched.

To prevent unwanted clock edges on first use, an empty dummy
transmission shall be done by the initialization procedure of the device
driver of this channel. This will set the clock mode to the correct state.
