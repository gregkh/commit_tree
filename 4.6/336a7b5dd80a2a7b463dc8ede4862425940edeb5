powerpc/module: Create a special stub for ftrace_caller()

In order to support the new -mprofile-kernel ABI, we need to be able to
call from the module back to ftrace_caller() (in the kernel) without
using the module's r2. That is because the function in this module which
is calling ftrace_caller() may not have setup r2, if it doesn't
otherwise need it (ie. it accesses no globals).

To make that work we add a new stub which is used for calling
ftrace_caller(), which uses the kernel toc instead of the module toc.
