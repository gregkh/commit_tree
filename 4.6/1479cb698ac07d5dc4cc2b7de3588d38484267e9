usb: dwc2: host: If using uframe scheduler, end splits better

The microframe scheduler figured out exactly how many transfers we need
for a split transaction.  Let's use this knowledge to know when to end
things.

Without this I found that certain devices would just keep responding
with tons of NYET resonses on their INT_IN endpoint.  These would just
keep going and going and eventually we'd decide to terminate the
transfer (because the whole frame changed), but by that time the
scheduler would decide that we "missed" the start of the next transfer.
I can also imagine that if we blow past the end of our scheduled time we
may mess up other things that were scheduled to happen.

No known test cases are improved by this patch except that the scheduler
code doesn't yell about MISSES constantly anymore.
