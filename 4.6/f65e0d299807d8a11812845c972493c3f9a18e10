ALSA: timer: Call notifier in the same spinlock

snd_timer_notify1() is called outside the spinlock and it retakes the
lock after the unlock.  This is rather racy, and it's safer to move
snd_timer_notify() call inside the main spinlock.

The patch also contains a slight refactoring / cleanup of the code.
Now all start/stop/continue/pause look more symmetric and a bit better
readable.
