staging/ion: Add support to get ion handle from dma buf

Currently we can only import dma buf fd's to get ion_handle.
Adding support to import dma buf handles to support kernel
specific use cases.

An example use case is in linux platforms such as Tizen, in which
DRM-GEM is used for buffer management for graphics. It has gem_handle
corresponding to a buffer and uses gem_name for sharing the buffer
with other processes. However,it also uses dma_buf fd for 3d operations.
For wayland, there are multiple calls for gem_handle to dma_buf fd
conversion. So, we store dma_buf associated with buffer. But, there is
no api for getting ion_handle from dma_buf. This patch exposes api to
retrieve the ion handle from dma_buf for similar use cases. With this
patch, we can integrate ION within DRM-GEM for buffer management and
dma_buf sharing.
