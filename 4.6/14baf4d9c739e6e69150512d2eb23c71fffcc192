cxl: Add guest-specific code

The new of.c file contains code to parse the device tree to find out
about cxl adapters and AFUs.

guest.c implements the guest-specific callbacks for the backend API.

The process element ID is not known until the context is attached, so
we have to separate the context ID assigned by the cxl driver from the
process element ID visible to the user applications. In bare-metal,
the 2 IDs match.
