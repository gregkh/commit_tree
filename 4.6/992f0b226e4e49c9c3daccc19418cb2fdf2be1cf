staging: lustre: take extra refcount in kiblnd_connreq_done

refcount taken by cmid is not reliable after kiblnd_connreq_done
released the glock because this connection is visible to other
threads, another thread can find and close this connection right
after kiblnd_connreq_done released the glock, if kiblnd_cm_callback
for RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED is called, it can release the
connection refcount taken by cmid. It means the connection could be
destroyed before kiblnd_connreq_done() finish operations on it.
