mac80211: add API to allow filtering frames in BA sessions

If any frames are dropped that are part of a BA session, the reorder
buffer will "indefinitely" (until the timeout) wait for them to come
in (or a BAR moving the window) and won't release frames after them.
This means it isn't possible to filter frames within a BA session in
firmware.

Introduce an API function that allows such filtering. Calling this
function will move the BA window forward to the new SSN, and allows
marking frames after the SSN as having been filtered, so any future
reordering activity will release frames while skipping the holes.
