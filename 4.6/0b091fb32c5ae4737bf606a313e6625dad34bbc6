staging/hfi1: Enable TID caching feature

This commit "flips the switch" on the TID caching feature
implemented in this patch series.

As well as enabling the new feature by tying the new function
with the PSM API, it also cleans up the old unneeded code,
data structure members, and variables.

Due to difference in operation and information, the tracing
functions related to expected receives had to be changed. This
patch include these changes.

The tracing function changes could not be split into a separate
commit without including both tracing variants at the same time.
This would have caused other complications and ugliness.
