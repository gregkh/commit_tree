x86/mce/AMD: Reduce number of blocks scanned per bank

From Fam17h onwards, the number of extended MCx_MISC register blocks is
reduced to 4. It is an architectural change from what we had on
earlier processors.

Although theoritically the total number of extended MCx_MISC
registers was 8 in earlier processor families, in practice we
only had to use the extra registers for MC4. And only 2 of those
were used. So this change does not affect older processors.
Tested on Fam10h and Fam15h systems.
