ahci: Add functions to manage runtime PM of AHCI ports

Add new functions ahci_rpm_get_port()/ahci_rpm_put_port() that change
runtime PM status of AHCI ports. Depending if the AHCI host has runtime PM
enabled or disabled calling these may trigger runtime suspend/resume of the
host controller.

We also call these functions in appropriate places to make sure host
controller registers are available before using them.
