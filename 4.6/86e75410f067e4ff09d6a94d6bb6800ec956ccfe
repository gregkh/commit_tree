PNP / ACPI: add ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_SERIAL_BUS as a valid type

An error message is printed for resources of type 19, which is a valid
supported resource type.  The Firmware Test Suite tool (fwts) reports
this as a test failure.  This change fixes the false test failures
for ASL that use type 19 (ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_SERIAL_BUS) resources.
