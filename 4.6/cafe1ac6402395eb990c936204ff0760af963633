drivers/tty: make serial 8250_ingenic.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/tty/serial/8250/Kconfig:config SERIAL_8250_INGENIC
drivers/tty/serial/8250/Kconfig:        bool "Support for Ingenic SoC serial ports"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
