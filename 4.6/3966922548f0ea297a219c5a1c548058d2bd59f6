ALSA: hda - Fix regression on ATI HDMI audio

The HDMI/DP audio output on ATI/AMD chips got broken due to the recent
restructuring of chmap.  Fortunately, Daniel Exner could bisect, and
pointed the culprit commit [739ffee97ed5: ALSA: hda - Add hdmi chmap
verb programming ops to chmap object].

This commit moved some ops from hdmi_ops to chmap_ops, and reassigned
the ops in the embedded chmap object in hdmi_spec instead.
Unfortunately, the reassignment of these ops in patch_atihdmi() were
moved into an if block that is performed only for old chips.  Thus, on
newer chips, the generic ops is still used, which doesn't work for
such ATI/AMD chips.

This patch addresses the regression, simply by moving the assignment
of chmap ops to the right place.
