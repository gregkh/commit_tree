tty: Refactor tty_ldisc_reinit() for reuse

At tty hangup, the line discipline instance is reinitialized by
closing the current ldisc instance and opening a new instance.
This operation is complicated by error recovery: if the attempt
to reinit the current line discipline fails, the line discipline
is reset to N_TTY (which should not but can fail).

Re-purpose tty_ldisc_reinit() to return a valid, open line discipline
instance, or otherwise, an error.
