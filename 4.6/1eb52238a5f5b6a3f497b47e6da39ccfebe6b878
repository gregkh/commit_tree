drm/i915/fbc: fix the FBC state checking code

We'll now call intel_fbc_pre_update instead of intel_fbc_deactivate
during atomic commits. This will continue to guarantee that we
deactivate FBC and it will also update the state checking structures
at the correct time. Then, later, at the point where we were calling
intel_fbc_update, we'll only need to call intel_fbc_post_update.

Also add the proper warnings in case we don't have the appropriate
locks. Daniel mentioned the warnings will have to be removed for async
commits, but let's keep them here while we can.
