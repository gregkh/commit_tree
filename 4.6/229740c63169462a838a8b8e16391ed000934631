udp_offload: Set encapsulation before inner completes.

UDP tunnel segmentation code relies on the inner offsets being set for
an UDP tunnel GSO packet, but the inner *_complete() functions will
set the inner offsets only if 'encapsulation' is set before calling
them.  Currently, udp_gro_complete() sets 'encapsulation' only after
the inner *_complete() functions are done.  This causes the inner
offsets having invalid values after udp_gro_complete() returns, which
in turn will make it impossible to properly segment the packet in case
it needs to be forwarded, which would be visible to the user either as
invalid packets being sent or as packet loss.

This patch fixes this by setting skb's 'encapsulation' in
udp_gro_complete() before calling into the inner complete functions,
and by making each possible UDP tunnel gro_complete() callback set the
inner_mac_header to the beginning of the tunnel payload.
