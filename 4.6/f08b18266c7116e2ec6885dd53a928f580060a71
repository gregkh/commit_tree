stm class: Prevent user-controllable allocations

Currently, the character device write method allocates a temporary buffer
for user's data, but the user's data size is not sanitized and can cause
arbitrarily large allocations via kzalloc() or an integer overflow that
will then result in overwriting kernel memory.

This patch trims the input buffer size to avoid these issues.
