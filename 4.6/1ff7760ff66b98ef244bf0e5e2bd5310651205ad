spi: spi-ti-qspi: Handle truncated frames properly

We clamp frame_len_words to a maximum of 4096, but do not actually
limit the number of words written or read through the DATA registers
or the length added to spi_message::actual_length.  This results in
silent data corruption for commands longer than this maximum.

Recalculate the length of each transfer, taking frame_len_words into
account.  Use this length in qspi_{read,write}_msg(), and to increment
spi_message::actual_length.
