cxl: Move bare-metal specific code to specialized files

Move a few functions around to better separate code specific to
bare-metal environment from code which will be commonly used between
guest and bare-metal.

Code specific to bare-metal is meant to be in native.c or pci.c
only. It's basically anything which touches the card p1 registers,
some p2 registers not needed from a guest and the PCI interface.
