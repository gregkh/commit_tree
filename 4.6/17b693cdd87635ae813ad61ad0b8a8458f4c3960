net: l3mdev: prefer VRF master for source address selection

When selecting an address in context of a VRF, the vrf master should be
preferred for address selection.  If it isn't, the user has a hard time
getting the system to select to their preference - the code will pick
the address off the first in-VRF interface it can find, which on a
router could well be a non-routable address.
