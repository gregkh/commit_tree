HID: sony: Add nyko core controller support

This adds rumble and LED support for nyko core controllers
using the sino lite chip vendor:1345 product:3008, for PS3.

Setting operational mode and output reports are the same as
sixaxis but the input report has a different format since the
PS3 accepts HID usb devices. For it to work, an exception is
needed to skip overriding the report descriptor and use the
original one.
