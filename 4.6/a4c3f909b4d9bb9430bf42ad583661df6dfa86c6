powerpc: Fix BUG_ON() reporting in real mode

I ran into this issue while debugging an early boot problem. The system
hit a BUG_ON() but report bug failed to print the line number and file
name. The reason being that the system was running in real mode and
report_bug() searches for addresses in the PAGE_OFFSET+ region.
