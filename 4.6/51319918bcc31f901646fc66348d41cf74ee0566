intel_idle: Fix deallocation order on the driver exit path.

In the module_exit() method, this driver first frees its per-CPU
pointer, then unregisters a callback making use of the pointer.
Furthermore, the function, intel_idle_cpuidle_devices_uninit, is racy
against CPU hot plugging as it calls for_each_online_cpu().

This patch corrects the issues by unregistering first on the exit path
while holding the hot plug lock.
