batman-adv: OGMv2 - add basic infrastructure

This is the initial implementation of the new OGM protocol
(version 2). It has been designed to work on top of the
newly added ELP.

In the previous version the OGM protocol was used to both
measure link qualities and flood the network with the metric
information. In this version the protocol is in charge of
the latter task only, leaving the former to ELP.

This means being able to decouple the interval used by the
neighbor discovery from the OGM broadcasting, which revealed
to be costly in dense networks and needed to be relaxed so
leading to a less responsive routing protocol.
