scsi: ufs: add retries to dme_peer get and set attribute

The dme_peer get/set attribute commands are prone to errors, therefore
we add three retries for the UIC command sending.  Error code returned
from ufshcd_send_uic_cmd() is checked, and unless it was successful or
the retries have finished, another command will be sent.
