dell-wmi: enable receiving WMI events on Dell Vostro V131

On some laptop models (e.g. Dell Vostro V131), WMI events are not
generated until a specific SMBIOS request is issued to register an event
listener [1].  As there seems to be no ACPI method or SMBIOS request to
determine without possible side effects whether a given machine needs to
issue this SMBIOS request in order to receive WMI events, DMI matching
is used to whitelist the models which need it.
