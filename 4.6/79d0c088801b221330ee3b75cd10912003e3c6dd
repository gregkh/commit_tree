staging/rdma/hfi1: Fix memory leaks

Fix 3 memory leaks reported by the LeakCheck tool in the KEDR framework.

The following resources were allocated memory during their respective
initializations but not freed during cleanup:
1. SDMA map elements
2. PIO map elements
3. HW send context to SW index map

This patch fixes the memory leaks by freeing the allocated memory in the
cleanup path.
