dm: fix rq_end_stats() NULL pointer in dm_requeue_original_request()

An "old" (.request_fn) DM 'struct request' stores a pointer to the
associated 'struct dm_rq_target_io' in rq->special.

dm_requeue_original_request(), previously named
dm_requeue_unmapped_original_request(), called dm_unprep_request() to
reset rq->special to NULL.  But rq_end_stats() would go on to hit a NULL
pointer deference because its call to tio_from_request() returned NULL.

Fix this by calling rq_end_stats() _before_ dm_unprep_request()
