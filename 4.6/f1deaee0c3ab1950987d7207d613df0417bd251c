can: ifi: Fix TX DLC configuration

The TX DLC, the transmission length information, was not written
into the transmit configuration register. When using the CAN core
with different CAN controller, the receiving CAN controller will
receive only the ID part of the CAN frame, but no data at all.

This patch adds the TX DLC into the register to fix this issue.
