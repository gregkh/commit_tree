ocfs2: fix disk file size and memory file size mismatch

When doing append direct write in an already allocated cluster, and fast
path in ocfs2_dio_get_block() is triggered, function
ocfs2_dio_end_io_write() will be skipped as there is no context
allocated.

As a result, the disk file size will not be changed as it should be.
The solution is to skip fast path when we are about to change file size.
