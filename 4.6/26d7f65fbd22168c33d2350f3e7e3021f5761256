x86/efi: Preface all print statements with efi* tag

The pr_*() calls in the x86 EFI code may or may not include a
subsystem tag, which makes it difficult to grep the kernel log for all
relevant EFI messages and leads users to miss important information.

Recently, a bug reporter provided all the EFI print messages from the
kernel log when trying to diagnose an issue but missed the following
statement because it wasn't prefixed with anything indicating it was
related to EFI,

  pr_err("Error ident-mapping new memmap (0x%lx)!\n", pa_memmap);
