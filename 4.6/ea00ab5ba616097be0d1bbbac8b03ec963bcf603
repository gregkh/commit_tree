ARM: omap2plus_defconfig: Enable ISP support and dependencies

The OMAP3 SoC has a Image Signal Processor (ISP) that's used to accelerate
camera images processing. The ISP driver implements V4L2, Media Controller
and V4L2 sub-dev interfaces so enable support for the driver and all these
dependencies to allow video capture to be tested using this HW IP block.

Also, disable the I2C ancillary drivers auto-select option since the media
driver does not auto-select the ancillary devices that are attached to the
bridge because this depends on what's present in the supported OMAP boards.
