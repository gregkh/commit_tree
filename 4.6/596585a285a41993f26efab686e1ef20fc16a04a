scsi: ufs: verify hba controller hce reg value

Sometimes due to hw issues it takes some time to the
host controller register to update. In order to verify the register
has updated, a polling is done until its value is set.

In addition the functions ufshcd_hba_stop() and
ufshcd_wait_for_register() was updated with an additional input
parameter, indicating the timeout between reads will
be done by sleeping or spinning the cpu.
