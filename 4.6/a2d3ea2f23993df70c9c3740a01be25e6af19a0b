serial: 8250/uniphier: fix modular build

The newly added uniphier serial port driver fails to build as
a loadable module when the base 8250 driver is built-in and
its console support enabled:

ERROR: "early_serial8250_setup" [drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_uniphier.ko] undefined!

This changes the driver to only provide the early console support
if it is built-in itself as well.
