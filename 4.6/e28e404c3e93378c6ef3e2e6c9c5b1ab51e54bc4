drm/i915: tidy up a few leftovers

There are a few bits of code which the transformations implemented by
the previous patch reveal to be suboptimal, once the notion of a per-
ring default context has gone away. So this tidies up the leftovers.

It could have been squashed into the previous patch, but that would have
made that patch less clearly a simple transformation. In particular, any
change which alters the code block structure or indentation has been
deferred into this separate patch, because such things tend to make
diffs more difficult to read.

v4:	Rebased
