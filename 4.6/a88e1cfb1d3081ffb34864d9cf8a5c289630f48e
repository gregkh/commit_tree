tracing: Add an unreg_all() callback to trigger commands

Add a new unreg_all() callback that can be used to remove all
command-specific triggers from an event and arrange to have it called
whenever a trigger file is opened with O_TRUNC set.

Commands that don't want truncate semantics, or existing commands that
don't implement this function simply do nothing and their triggers
remain intact.
