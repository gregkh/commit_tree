ocfs2: extend enough credits for freeing one truncate record while replaying truncate records

Now function ocfs2_replay_truncate_records() first modifies tl_used,
then calls ocfs2_extend_trans() to extend transactions for gd and alloc
inode used for freeing clusters.  jbd2_journal_restart() may be called
and it may happen that tl_used in truncate log is decreased but the
clusters are not freed, which means these clusters are lost.  So we
should avoid extending transactions in these two operations.
