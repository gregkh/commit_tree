ALSA: dice: change notification mask to detect lock status change

With former patchset, ALSA dice driver doesn't change clock parameters
anymore, while the driver still touch clock configuration for phase lock.

Although the locking status is in Dice notification, the driver doesn't
detect it. Usually, this causes no issues because in most case
NOTIFY_LOCK_CHG notification transfers after NOTIFY_CLOCK_ACCEPTED
notification, while it's better to detect locking status.

This commit changes notification mask just to detect lock status change.
