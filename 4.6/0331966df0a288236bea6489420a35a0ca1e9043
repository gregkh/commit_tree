arm: boot: beaglex15: pass correct interrupt

According to latest schematics [1], GPIO_1/VBUSDET
on TPS659038 is tied to AM57x GPIO4_21. We can use
that as a VBUS interrupt, instead of relying on
PMIC's VBUS interrupts which don't seem to be firing
on x15 at all.

A follow up patch will add support for using this
GPIO-based interrupt mechanism for notifying about
VBUS.
