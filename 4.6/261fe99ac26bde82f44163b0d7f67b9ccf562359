drm/i915/fbc: don't flush for operations on the wrong frontbuffer

If frontbuffer_bits doesn't match the current frontbuffer, there's no
reason to recompress or update FBC.

There was a plan to make the FBC test suite catch this type of
problem, but it never got implemented due to being low priority.

While at it, also implement Ville's suggestion and use
plane->frontbuffer_bit instead of INTEL_FRONTBUFFER_PRIMARY.
