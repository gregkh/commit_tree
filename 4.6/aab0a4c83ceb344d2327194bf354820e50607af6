ARM: dts: at91: sam9x5: Fix the memory range assigned to the PMC

The memory range assigned to the PMC (Power Management Controller) was
not including the PMC_PCR register which are used to control peripheral
clocks.

This was working fine thanks to the page granularity of ioremap(), but
started to fail when we switched to syscon/regmap, because regmap is
making sure that all accesses are falling into the reserved range.
