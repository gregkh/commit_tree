rapidio/rionet: fix deadlock on SMP

Fix deadlocking during concurrent receive and transmit operations on SMP
platforms caused by the use of incorrect lock: on transmit 'tx_lock'
spinlock should be used instead of 'lock' which is used for receive
operation.

This fix is applicable to kernel versions starting from v2.15.
