blk-mq: Use proper cpumask iterator

queue_for_each_ctx() iterates over per_cpu variables under the assumption that
the possible cpu mask cannot have holes. That's wrong as all cpumasks can have
holes. In case there are holes the iteration ends up accessing uninitialized
memory and crashing as a result.

Replace the macro by a proper for_each_possible_cpu() loop and drop the unused
macro blk_ctx_sum() which references queue_for_each_ctx().
