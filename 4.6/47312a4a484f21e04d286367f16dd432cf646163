drivers/misc: make arm-charlcd.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/misc/Kconfig:config ARM_CHARLCD
drivers/misc/Kconfig:   bool "ARM Ltd. Character LCD Driver"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and this driver did not have a ".remove"
function coded for non-modular drivers either.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
