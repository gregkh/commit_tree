powerpc/perf: Remove PME_ prefix for power7 events

We used the PME_ prefix earlier to avoid some macro/variable name
collisions.  We have since changed the way we define/use the event
macros so we no longer need the prefix.

By dropping the prefix, we keep the the event macros consistent with
their official names.
