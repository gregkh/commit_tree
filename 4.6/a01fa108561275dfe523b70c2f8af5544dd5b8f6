staging: lustre: make ko2iblnd connect parameters persistent

Store map-on-demand and peertx credits in the peer, since the peer
is persistent. Also made sure that when assigning the parameters
received on the connection to the peer structure through create,
that if another peer is added before grabbing the lock we assign
these parameters to it as well.
