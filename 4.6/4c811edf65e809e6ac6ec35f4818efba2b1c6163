arm64: dts: r8a7795: Add GIC-400 virtual interfaces

Besides the distributor and the CPU interface the GIC-400 additionally
supports the virtual interface control blocks and the virtual CPU interfaces.

Add the physical base addresses and size for these.

See

http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0471b/index.html
-> 3.2. GIC-400 register map

and Linux kernel's

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm,gic.txt

for more details.

For the at GICH Virtual interface control blocks at 0xf1040000 cover the
whole 128kB (0x20000) range. This is done based on the advice from Marc
Zyngier http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg483139.html
