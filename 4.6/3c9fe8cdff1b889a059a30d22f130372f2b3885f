vfs: add lookup_hash() helper

Overlayfs needs lookup without inode_permission() and already has the name
hash (in form of dentry->d_name on overlayfs dentry).  It also doesn't
support filesystems with d_op->d_hash() so basically it only needs
the actual hashed lookup from lookup_one_len_unlocked()

So add a new helper that does unlocked lookup of a hashed name.
