amd-xgbe: Do traffic class setup when called through dcbnl

Currently the netdev traffic class setup is only performed when invoked
through the ndo_setup_tc interface. However, the same setup should be
performed when the dcbnl interface (ieee_setets) is invoked. Rework the
netdev traffic class setup to be invokable through either interface and
also provide the priority to traffic class mapping if available.
