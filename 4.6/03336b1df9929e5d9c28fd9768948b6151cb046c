arm64: prevent potential circular header dependencies in asm/bug.h

Currently, using BUG_ON() in header files is cumbersome, due to the fact
that asm/bug.h transitively includes a lot of other header files, resulting
in the actual BUG_ON() invocation appearing before its definition in the
preprocessor input. So let's reverse the #include dependency between
asm/bug.h and asm/debug-monitors.h, by moving the definition of BUG_BRK_IMM
from the latter to the former. Also fix up one user of asm/debug-monitors.h
which relied on a transitive include.
