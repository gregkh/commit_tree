cpufreq: conservative: Update sample_delay_ns immediately

The ondemand governor already updates sample_delay_ns immediately on
updates to the sampling rate, but conservative doesn't do that.

It was left out earlier as the code was really too complex to get
that done easily.  Things are sorted out very well now, however, and
the conservative governor can be modified to follow ondemand in that
respect.

Moreover, since the code needed to implement that in the
conservative governor would be identical to the corresponding
ondemand governor's code, make that code common and change both
governors to use it.
