scsi_dh_alua: switch to scsi_execute_req_flags()

All commands are issued synchronously, so no need to open-code
scsi_execute_req_flags() anymore. And we can get rid of the
static sense code structure element. scsi_execute_req_flags()
will be setting REQ_QUIET and REQ_PREEMPT, but that is
perfectly fine as we're evaluating and logging any errors
ourselves and we really need to send the command even if
the device is quiesced.
