perf/x86/pebs: Add proper PEBS constraints for Broadwell

This patch adds a Broadwell specific PEBS event constraint table.

Broadwell has a fix for the HT corruption bug erratum HSD29 on
Haswell. Therefore, there is no need to mark events 0xd0, 0xd1, 0xd2,
0xd3 has requiring the exclusive mode across both sibling HT threads.
This holds true for regular counting and sampling (see core.c) and
PEBS (ds.c) which we fix in this patch.

In doing so, we relax evnt scheduling for these events, they can now
be programmed on any 4 counters without impacting what is measured on
the sibling thread.
