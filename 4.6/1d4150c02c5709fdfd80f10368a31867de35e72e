net_sched: prepare tcf_hashinfo_destroy() for netns support

We only release the memory of the hashtable itself, not its
entries inside. This is not a problem yet since we only call
it in module release path, and module is refcount'ed by
actions. This would be a problem after we move the per module
hinfo into per netns in the latter patch.
