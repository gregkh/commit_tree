pci-sysfs: use proper file capability helper function

The PCI config access checked the file capabilities correctly, but used
the itnernal security capability check rather than the helper function
that is actually meant for that.

The security_capable() has unusual return values and is not meant to be
used elsewhere (the only other use is in the capability checking
functions that we actually intend people to use, and this odd PCI usage
really stood out when looking around the capability code.
