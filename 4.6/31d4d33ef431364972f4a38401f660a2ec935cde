rtc: pcf85063: fix time/date setting

When setting a new time/date the RTC's clock must be stopped first, in
order to write the time/date registers in an atomic manner.
So, this change stops the clock first and then writes the time/date
registers and the clock control register (to re-enable the clock) in one
turn.
