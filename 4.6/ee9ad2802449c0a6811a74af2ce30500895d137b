be2net: SRIOV Queue distribution should factor in EQ-count of VFs

The SRIOV resource distribution logic for RX/TX queue counts is not optimal
when a small number of VFs are enabled. It does not take into account the
VF's EQ count while computing the queue counts. Because of this, the VF
gets a large number of queues, though it doesn't have sufficient EQs,
resulting in wasted queue resources. And the PF gets a smaller share of
queues though it has more EQs. Fix this by capping the VF queue count at
its EQ count.
