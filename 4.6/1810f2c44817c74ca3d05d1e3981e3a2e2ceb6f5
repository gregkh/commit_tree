stm class: Fix unlocking braino in the error path

If an illegal attempt is made to unlink stm source device from an
stm device, the stm device's link spinlock mistakenly remains locked.
While this really shouldn't happen (there's a warning in place), the
locking should remain in order so that we can still recover from this
situation if it indeed does happen.

This patch unifies the unlocking in the exit path of
__stm_source_link_drop() to fix this.
