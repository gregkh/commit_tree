ipv6: Pass proto to csum_ipv6_magic as __u8 instead of unsigned short

This patch updates csum_ipv6_magic so that it correctly recognizes that
protocol is a unsigned 8 bit value.

This will allow us to better understand what limitations may or may not be
present in how we handle the data.  For example there are a number of
places that call htonl on the protocol value.  This is likely not necessary
and can be replaced with a multiplication by ntohl(1) which will be
converted to a shift by the compiler.
