libnvdimm, pfn: fix uuid validation

If we detect a namespace has a stale info block in the init path, we
should overwrite with the latest configuration.  In fact, we already
return -ENODEV when the parent uuid is invalid, the same should be done
for the 'self' uuid.  Otherwise we can get into a condition where
userspace is unable to reconfigure the pfn-device without directly /
manually invalidating the info block.
