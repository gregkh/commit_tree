stm class: Fix master deallocation in device unregistering

The device unregister path uses wrong master index range when it tries
to free the allocated masters, it should, as does the rest of the stm
class code, use real master IDs.

This patch fixes the device unregister path to use real master IDs to
avoid memory leaks after unloading the stm driver.
