staging/rdma/hfi1: Split last 8 bytes of copy to user buffer

Copy the last 8 bytes of user mode RC WRITE_ONLY and WRITE_LAST
opcodes separately from the rest of the data.

It is a de-facto standard for some MPI implementations to use a
poll on the last few bytes of a verbs message to indicate that
the message has been received rather than follow the required
function method.  The driver uses the kernel memcpy routine, which
becomes "rep movsb" on modern machines.  This copy, while very
fast, does not guarantee in-order copy completion and the result
is an occasional perceived corrupted packet.  Avoid the issue by
splitting the last 8 bytes to copy from the verbs opcodes where it
matters and performing an in-order byte copy.
