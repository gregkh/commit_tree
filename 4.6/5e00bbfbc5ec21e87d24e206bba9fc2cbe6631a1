tty: Fix merge of "tty: Refactor tty_open()"

Commit e9036d066236 ("tty: Drop krefs for interrupted tty lock")
fixed a tty reference counting problem introduced in
commit 0bfd464d3fdd ("tty: Wait interruptibly for tty lock on reopen"),
so v4.5.0 is correct.

However, commit d6203d0c7b73 ("tty: Refactor tty_open()") moved the
relevant code for 4.6-rc1; correct the merge.
