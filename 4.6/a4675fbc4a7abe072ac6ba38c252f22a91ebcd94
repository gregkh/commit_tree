cpufreq: intel_pstate: Replace timers with utilization update callbacks

Instead of using a per-CPU deferrable timer for utilization sampling
and P-states adjustments, register a utilization update callback that
will be invoked from the scheduler on utilization changes.

The sampling rate is still the same as what was used for the deferrable
timers, so the functional impact of this patch should not be significant.

Based on an earlier patch from Srinivas Pandruvada.
