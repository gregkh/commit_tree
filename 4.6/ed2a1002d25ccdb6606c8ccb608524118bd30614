irqchip/mbigen: Handle multiple device nodes in a mbigen module

Each mbigen device is represented as a independent platform device. If the
devices belong to the same mbigen hardware module, then the register space for
these devices is the same. That leads to a resource conflict.

The solution for this is to represent the mbigen module as a platform device
and make the mbigen devices subdevices of that. The register space is
associated to the mbigen module and therefor the resource conflict is avoided.

[ tglx: Massaged changelog, cleaned up the code and removed the silly printk ]
