spi: imx: drop bogus tests for rx/tx bufs in DMA transfer

The driver tries to be clever by only setting up DMA channels when
the corresponding sg tables are non NULL. The sg tables are embedded
structs in struct spi_transfer, so they are guaranteed to be non NULL
which makes the if(tx)/if(rx) tests completely bogus. The driver even
sets the SPI_MASTER_MUST_RX / SPI_MASTER_MUST_TX flags which makes sure
the sg tables are not only present but also non empty.
Drop the tests and make the DMA path easier to follow.
