ARM: exynos_defconfig: Enable NEON, accelerated crypto and cpufreq stats

Enable the kernel NEON mode and asm/NEON accelerated crypto algorithms
which should bring performance benefits on Exynos SoCs. Enable these as
modules because they are optional, not essential anyhow for platform
booting nor related directly to Exynos Soc. All accelerated algorithms
pass booting self-tests on Odroid XU4 (Exynos5422) and Trats2 (Exynos4412).

Additionally enable cpufreq statistics as they are useful for debugging.
