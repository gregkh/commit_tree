IB/srpt: Fix srpt_write_pending()

The only allowed return values for the write_pending() callback
function are 0, -EAGAIN and -ENOMEM. Since attempting to perform
RDMA over a disconnecting channel will result in an IB error
completion anyway, remove the code that checks the channel state
from srpt_write_pending().
