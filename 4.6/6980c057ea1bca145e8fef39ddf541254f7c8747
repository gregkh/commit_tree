ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add i915 enabling in skl probe

The SKL also supports HDMI output so in probe we need to enable
the HDMI using common i915 APIs to ensure it gets probed on the

After S3 during the controller resequencing the codec domain need
to be kept ON for successful reconfiguration of Codec. Once
configured it will be turned OFF in codec driver.
