staging: unisys: clean up initiate_chipset_device_pause_resume()

Simplify this function by removing the goto in favor of handling errors
immediately. Eliminate the vaguely-named variable x, and remove the
unneeded initialization of rc. Lastly, provide meaningful error values
to the callback function instead of just passing back a -1 for failure.
