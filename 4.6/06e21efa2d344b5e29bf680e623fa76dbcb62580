usb-misc: sisusbvga: Fix coding style: vertical whitespace changes

This patch fixes whitespace coding style issues that can't be fixed
without adding newlines. This patch fixes the following checkpatch
warnings:
 - 20 ERROR: trailing statements should be on next line
 - 15 WARNING: line over 80 characters
 - 03 WARNING: Missing a blank line after declarations
 - 01 ERROR: space required after that ','

Five lines over 80 characters are left. The first three wont change as
the fix would require split the cast and variable name in different
lines which makes the code less readable. The last two will be fixed by
other patch in the series.
