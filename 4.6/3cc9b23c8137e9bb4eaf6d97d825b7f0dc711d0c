kernfs: kernfs_sop_show_path: don't return 0 after seq_dentry call

Our caller expects 0 on success, not >0.

This fixes a bug in the patch

	cgroup, kernfs: make mountinfo show properly scoped path for cgroup namespaces

where /sys does not show up in mountinfo, breaking criu.

Thanks for catching this, Andrei.
