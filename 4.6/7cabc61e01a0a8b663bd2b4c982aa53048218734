fuse: do not use iocb after it may have been freed

There's a race in fuse_direct_IO(), whereby is_sync_kiocb() is called on an
iocb that could have been freed if async io has already completed.  The fix
in this case is simple and obvious: cache the result before starting io.

It was discovered by KASan:
