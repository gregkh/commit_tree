dlm: config: Fix ENOMEM failures in make_cluster()

Commit 1ae1602de0 "configfs: switch ->default groups to a linked list"
left the NULL gps pointer behind after removing the kcalloc() call which
made it non-NULL. It also left the !gps check in place so make_cluster()
now fails with ENOMEM. Remove the remaining uses of the gps variable to
fix that.
