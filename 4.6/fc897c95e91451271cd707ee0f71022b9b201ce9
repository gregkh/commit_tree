s390/mm: handle PTE-mapped tail pages in fast gup

With the THP refcounting rework it is possible to see THP compound tail
pages mapped with PTEs during a THP split. This needs to be considered
when using page_cache_get_speculative(), which will always fail on tail
pages because ->_count is always zero. commit 7aef4172 "mm: handle
PTE-mapped tail pages in gerneric fast gup implementaiton" fixed it for
the generic fast gup code by using compound_head(page) instead of page,
but not for s390.

This patch is a 1:1 adaption of commit 7aef4172 for the s390 fast gup
code. Without this fix, gup will fall back to the slow path or fail
in the unlikely scenario that we hit a THP under splitting in-between
the page table split and the compound page split.
