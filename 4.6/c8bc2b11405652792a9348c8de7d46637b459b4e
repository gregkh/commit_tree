arm-cci: write_counter: Remove redundant check

pmu_write_counter() is now only called from pmu_write_counters(),
which does so for each set index in the given mask, bounded by
cci_pmu->num_cntrs. So, there is no need for an extra check to
make sure the given counter is valid inside pmu_write_counter.
This patch gets rid of that.
