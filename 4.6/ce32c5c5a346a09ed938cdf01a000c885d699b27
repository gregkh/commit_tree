ARM: davinci: DA8xx+DMx combined kernels need PATCH_PHYS_VIRT

We already forbid that combination when AUTO_ZRELADDR is disabled,
for the same reason that the two have their RAM at different
physical addresses as seen from the CPU.

This does the same change for PATCH_PHYS_VIRT: if you disable
either of the options, Kconfig now enforces that you have to
pick one or the other SoC family.
