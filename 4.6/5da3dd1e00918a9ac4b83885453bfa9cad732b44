cpufreq: governor: Avoid passing dbs_data pointers around unnecessarily

Do not pass struct dbs_data pointers to the family of functions
implementing governor operations in cpufreq_governor.c as they can
take that pointer from policy->governor by themselves.

The cpufreq_governor_init() case is slightly more complicated, since
policy->governor may be NULL when it is invoked, but then it can reach
the pointer in question via its cdata argument just fine.

While at it, rework cpufreq_governor_dbs() to avoid a pointless
policy_governor check in the CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_INIT case.
