KVM: s390: wake up when the VCPU cpu timer expires

When the VCPU cpu timer expires, we have to wake up just like when the ckc
triggers. For now, setting up a cpu timer in the guest and going into
enabled wait will never lead to a wakeup. This patch fixes this problem.
Just as for the ckc, we have to take care of waking up too early. We
have to recalculate the sleep time and go back to sleep.

Please note that the timer callback calls kvm_s390_get_cpu_timer() from
interrupt context. As the timer is canceled when leaving handle_wait(),
and we don't do any VCPU cpu timer writes/updates in that function, we can
be sure that we will never try to read the VCPU cpu timer from the same cpu
that is currentyl updating the timer (deadlock).
