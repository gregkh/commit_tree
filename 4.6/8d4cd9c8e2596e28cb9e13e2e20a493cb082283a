staging: mt29f_spinand: Replacing pr_info with dev_info after the call to devm_kzalloc

The function devm_kzalloc has a first argument of type struct device *.
This is the type of argument required by printing functions such as
dev_info, dev_err, etc. Thus, functions like pr_info should not normally
be used after a call to devm_kzalloc. Thus, all pr_info occurances are
replaced with dev_info function calls.

This was done using Coccinelle, the patch being:
@@
expression E1,E2;
expression list args;
@@

E1 = devm_kzalloc(E2, ...);
<...
- pr_info(
+ dev_info(E2,
args);
...>
