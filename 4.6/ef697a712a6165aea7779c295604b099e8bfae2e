KVM: VMX: fix nested vpid for old KVM guests

Old KVM guests invoke single-context invvpid without actually checking
whether it is supported.  This was fixed by commit 518c8ae ("KVM: VMX:
Make sure single type invvpid is supported before issuing invvpid
instruction", 2010-08-01) and the patch after, but pre-2.6.36
kernels lack it including RHEL 6.
