staging: lustre: kg_sem semaphore handling is incorrectly

During the removal of the cfs wrappers the kg_sem semaphore
was handled incorrectly. We need to take a write lock when
writing data to the kkuc_groups. The libcfs_kkuc_group_foreach
needs to only take a read lock. This makes use match the
OpenSFS development branch.
