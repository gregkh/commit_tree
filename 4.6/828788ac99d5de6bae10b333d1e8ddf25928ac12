vxlan: restructure vxlan.h definitions

RCO and GBP are VXLAN extensions, not specified in RFC 7348. Because of
that, they need to be explicitly enabled when creating vxlan interface. By
default, those extensions are not used and plain VXLAN header is sent and
received.

Reflect this in vxlan.h: first, the plain VXLAN header is defined. Following
it, RCO is documented and defined, and likewise for GBP.
