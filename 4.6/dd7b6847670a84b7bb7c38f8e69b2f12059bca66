x86/mm: Honour passed pgprot in track_pfn_insert() and track_pfn_remap()

track_pfn_insert() overwrites the pgprot that is passed in with a value
based on the VMA's page_prot.  This is a problem for people trying to
do clever things with the new vm_insert_pfn_prot() as it will simply
overwrite the passed protection flags.  If we use the current value of
the pgprot as the base, then it will behave as people are expecting.

Also fix track_pfn_remap() in the same way.
