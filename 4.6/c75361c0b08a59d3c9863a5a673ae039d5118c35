cpufreq: Make cpufreq_quick_get() safe to call

The function, cpufreq_quick_get, accesses the global 'cpufreq_driver' and
its fields without taking the associated lock, cpufreq_driver_lock.

Without the locking, nothing guarantees that 'cpufreq_driver' remains
consistent during the call.  This patch fixes the issue by taking the lock
before accessing the data structure.
