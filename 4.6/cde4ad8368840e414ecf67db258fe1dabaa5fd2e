stm class: Guard output assignment against concurrency

It is possible to concurrently assign the same output (a character
device writer or an stm_source device) to different stm devices,
which sets off a strategically placed warning in stm_output_assign().

To avoid this, use a spinlock to serialize (un)assignments between
outputs and stm devices.
