[media] timblogiw: move to staging in preparation for removal

The Timberdale FPGA video driver has not seen any real development
since 2011 (and very little before that).

One of the problems with the timblogiw driver is that it uses videobuf
instead of the newer vb2 framework. The long term goal is to either
convert or remove any driver still using videobuf. Since none of the
core v4l developers has the hardware, we cannot convert it ourselves.

As far as I can tell it was only used in an Intel demo board in 2009
using Meego:

which has since been superseded.

Moving this driver to staging is the first step towards removal. After 2 or
3 kernel cycles it will be removed altogether unless someone steps up to
clean up this driver.
