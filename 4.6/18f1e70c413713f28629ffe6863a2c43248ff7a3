mlxsw: spectrum: Introduce port splitting

Allow a user to split or unsplit a port using the newly introduced
devlink ops.

Once split, the original netdev is destroyed and 2 or 4 others are
created, according to user configuration. The new ports are like any
other port, with the sole difference of supporting a lower maximum
speed. When unsplit, the reverse process takes place.
