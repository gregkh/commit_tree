dm cache metadata: fix READ_LOCK macros and cleanup WRITE_LOCK macros

The READ_LOCK macro was incorrectly returning -EINVAL if
dm_bm_is_read_only() was true -- it will always be true once the cache
metadata transitions to read-only by dm_cache_metadata_set_read_only().

Wrap READ_LOCK and WRITE_LOCK multi-statement macros in do {} while(0).
Also, all accesses of the 'cmd' argument passed to these related macros
are now encapsulated in parenthesis.

A follow-up patch can be developed to eliminate the use of macros in
favor of pure C code.  Avoiding that now given that this needs to apply
to stable@.
