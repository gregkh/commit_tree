cpufreq: Select IRQ_WORK if CPU_FREQ_GOV_COMMON is set

Commit 0eb463be3436 (cpufreq: governor: Replace timers with utilization
update callbacks) made CPU_FREQ select IRQ_WORK, but that's not
necessary, as it is sufficient for IRQ_WORK to be selected by
CPU_FREQ_GOV_COMMON, so modify the cpufreq Kconfig to that effect.
