f2fs: reconstruct the code to free an extent_node

There are three steps to free an extent node:
1) list_del_init, 2)__detach_extent_node, 3) kmem_cache_free

In path f2fs_destroy_extent_tree, 1->2->3 to free a node,
But in path f2fs_update_extent_tree_range, it is 2->1->3.

This patch makes all the order to be: 1->2->3
It makes sense, since in the next patch, we import a victim list in the
path shrink_extent_tree, we could check if the extent_node is in the victim
list by checking the list_empty(). So it is necessary to put 1) first.
