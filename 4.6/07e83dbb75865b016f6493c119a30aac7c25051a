efi/efistub: Prevent __init annotations from being used

__init annotations should not be used in the EFI stub, since the code is
either included in the decompressor (x86, ARM) where they have no effect,
or the whole stub is __init annotated at the section level (arm64), by
renaming the sections.

In the second case the __init annotations will be redundant, and will
result in section names like .init.init.text, and our linker script does
not expect that.

So un-#define __init so that its inadvertent use will force a build error.
