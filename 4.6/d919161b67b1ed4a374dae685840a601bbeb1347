drm/i915: Pass the correct encoder to intel_ddi_clk_select() with MST

We're supposed to pass the primary DP encoder to intel_ddi_clk_select(),
not the fake MST encoder. Do so.

There's no real bug here though, since intel_ddi_clk_select() only
checks if the encoder type is EDP (which it isn't for either the
primary DP encoder or the fake MST encoder), and it gets the DDI port
via intel_ddi_get_encoder_port() (which knows how to do the
fake->primary->port dance itself).
