IB/core: Add subnet prefix to port info

The subnet prefix is a part of the port_info MAD returned and should be
available at the ib_port_attr struct. We define it here and provide a
default implementation in case the hardware driver does not provide one.
The subnet prefix is required when creating the address vector to access
the SA in networks where GRH must be used.
