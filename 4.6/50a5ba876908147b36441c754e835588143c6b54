i2c: mux: demux-pinctrl: add driver

This driver allows an I2C bus to switch between multiple masters. This
is not hot-switching because connected I2C slaves will be
re-instantiated. It is meant to select the best I2C core at runtime once
the task is known. Example: Prefer i2c-gpio over another I2C core
because of HW errata affecting your use case.
