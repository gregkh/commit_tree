rtc: s5m: De-inline large functions to save space

Few functions were marked inline even though they were relatively large
and sometimes used in multiple places. De-inline them to let the
compiler decide whether optimization makes sense. This fixes inline_hunt
report:
drivers/rtc/rtc-s5m.c: Deinline s5m8767_rtc_set_alarm_reg, save 704 bytes
drivers/rtc/rtc-s5m.c: Deinline s5m8767_wait_for_udr_update, save 192 bytes
