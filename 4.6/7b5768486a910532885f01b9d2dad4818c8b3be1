rtc: pcf85063: simplify code to read the current time

By using i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data() the code is now much simpler.

While at it: when reading the RTC's seconds register, all time/date registers
are frozen until the RTC's year register is read. So it is important to read
all time/date registers in one turn to not lose a second event. Make it more
clear why the read must happen in this way.
