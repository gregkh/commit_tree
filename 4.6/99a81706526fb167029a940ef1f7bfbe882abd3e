clk: at91: remove IRQ handling and use polling

The AT91 clock drivers make use of IRQs to avoid polling when waiting for
some clocks to be enabled. Unfortunately, this leads to a crash when those
IRQs are threaded (which happens when using preempt-rt) because they are
registered before thread creation is possible.

Use polling on those clocks instead to avoid the problem.
