intel_th: sth: Sanitize packet callback's return values

According to the stm class interface, the packet callback should return
an error if it is asked to generate packets that it doesn't support.
When it succeeds, it should return number of bytes consumed from its
payload. Currently, for FLAG packet it mistakenly returns 1.

This patch addresses these issues.
