KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add tunable to control H_IPI redirection

Redirecting the wakeup of a VCPU from the H_IPI hypercall to
a core running in the host is usually a good idea, most workloads
seemed to benefit. However, in one heavily interrupt-driven SMT1
workload, some regression was observed. This patch adds a kvm_hv
module parameter called h_ipi_redirect to control this feature.

The default value for this tunable is 1 - that is enable the feature.
