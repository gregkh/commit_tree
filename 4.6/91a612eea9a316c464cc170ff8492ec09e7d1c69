perf/core: Fix dynamic interrupt throttle

There were two problems with the dynamic interrupt throttle mechanism,
both triggered by the same action.

When you (or perf_fuzzer) write a huge value into
/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate the computed
perf_sample_allowed_ns becomes 0. This effectively disables the whole
dynamic throttle.

This is fixed by ensuring update_perf_cpu_limits() never sets the
value to 0. However, we allow disabling of the dynamic throttle by
writing 100 to /proc/sys/kernel/perf_cpu_time_max_percent. This will
generate a warning in dmesg.

The second problem is that by setting the max_sample_rate to a huge
number, the adaptive process can take a few tries, since it halfs the
limit each time. Change that to directly compute a new value based on
the observed duration.
