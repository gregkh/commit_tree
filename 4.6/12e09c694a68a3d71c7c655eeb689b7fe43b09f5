qed: Support B0 instead of A0

BB_A0 is a development model that is will not reach actual clients.
In fact, future firmware would simply fail to initialize such chip.

This changes the configuration into B0 instead of A0, and adds a safeguard
against the slim chance someone would actually try this with an A0 adapter
in which case probe would gracefully fail.
