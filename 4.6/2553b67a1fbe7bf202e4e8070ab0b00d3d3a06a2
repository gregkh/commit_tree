lib/bug.c: use common WARN helper

The traceoff_on_warning option doesn't have any effect on s390, powerpc,
arm64, parisc, and sh because there are two different types of WARN
implementations:

1) The above mentioned architectures treat WARN() as a special case of a
   BUG() exception.  They handle warnings in report_bug() in lib/bug.c.

2) All other architectures just call warn_slowpath_*() directly.  Their
   warnings are handled in warn_slowpath_common() in kernel/panic.c.

Support traceoff_on_warning on all architectures and prevent any future
divergence by using a single common function to emit the warning.

Also remove the '()' from '%pS()', because the parentheses look funky:

  [   45.607629] WARNING: at /root/warn_mod/warn_mod.c:17 .init_dummy+0x20/0x40 [warn_mod]()
