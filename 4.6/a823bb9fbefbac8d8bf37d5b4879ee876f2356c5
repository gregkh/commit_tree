clk: qcom: gdsc: Add support for votable gdscs

Some gdscs might be controlled via voting registers and might not
really disable when the kernel intends to disable them (due to other
votes keeping them enabled)
Mark these gdscs with a flag for we do not check/wait on a disable
status for these gdscs within the kernel disable callback.

Also at boot, if these GDSCs are found to be ON, we make sure we
vote for them before we inform the genpd framework about their
status. If genpd gets no users, it then disables (removes the vote)
them as part of genpd_poweroff_unused()
