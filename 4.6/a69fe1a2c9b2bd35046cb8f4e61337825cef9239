ARC: build: Turn off -Wmaybe-uninitialized for ARC gcc 4.8

linux-next has been reporting gazillion warnings for ARC build and
I finally decided to take a bite:

http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/buildresult/12638735/

Most of the them are due to -Wmaybe-uninitialized

| ../kernel/sysctl.c: In function '__do_proc_doulongvec_minmax':
| ../kernel/sysctl.c:1928:12: warning: 'p' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
|   ret = tmp - *buf;
|            ^
| ../kernel/sysctl.c:2342:29: note: 'p' was declared here
|  char *kbuf = NULL, *p;
|                     ^
| ...
| ...

Cursory look at code seemed fine and a definite gcc false positive in say
kernel/sysctl.c

Mystery was why only for ARC (and not with ARM linaro toolchain based
off same gcc 4.8). Turns out that -O3 (default for ARC) triggers these
and if I enable -O3 for ARM kernel build, I see the same splat.

I initially wanted to disable this only for gcc 4.8, but Arnd reported
it is seen even on gcc 6.0 for ARM with -O3. Thus better to disable
this independent of gcc version.
