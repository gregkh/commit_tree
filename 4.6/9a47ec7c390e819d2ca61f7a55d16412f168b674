scsi: ufs: make error handling bit faster

UFS driver's error handler forcefully tries to clear all the pending
requests. For each pending request in the queue, it waits 1 sec for it
to get cleared. If we have multiple requests in the queue then it's
possible that we might end up waiting for those many seconds before
resetting the host. But note that resetting host would any way clear
all the pending requests from the hardware. Hence this change skips
the forceful clear of the pending requests if we are anyway going to
reset the host (for fatal errors).
