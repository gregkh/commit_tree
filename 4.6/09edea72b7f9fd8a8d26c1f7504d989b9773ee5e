KVM: i8254: pass struct kvm_pit instead of kvm in PIT

This patch passes struct kvm_pit into internal PIT functions.
Those functions used to get PIT through kvm->arch.vpit, even though most
of them never used *kvm for other purposes.  Another benefit is that we
don't need to set kvm->arch.vpit during initialization.
