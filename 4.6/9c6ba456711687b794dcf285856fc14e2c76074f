Input: powermate - fix oops with malicious USB descriptors

The powermate driver expects at least one valid USB endpoint in its
probe function.  If given malicious descriptors that specify 0 for
the number of endpoints, it will crash.  Validate the number of
endpoints on the interface before using them.
