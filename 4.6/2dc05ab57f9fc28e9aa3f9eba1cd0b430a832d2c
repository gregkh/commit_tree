IB/qib: Begin to use rdmavt for verbs

This patch begins to make use of rdmavt by registering with it and
providing access to the header files. This is just the beginning of
rdmavt support in qib.

Most functionality is still being done in the driver, set flags so that
rdmavt will let qib continue to handle mr, qp, and cq init.
