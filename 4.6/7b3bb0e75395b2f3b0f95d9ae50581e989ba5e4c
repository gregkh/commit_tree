stm class: Fix an off-by-one in master array allocation

Since both sw_start and sw_end are master indices, the size of array
that holds them is sw_end - sw_start + 1, which the current code gets
wrong, allocating one item less than required.

This patch corrects the allocation size, avoiding potential slab
corruption.
