clk: sunxi: factors: Consolidate get_factors parameters into a struct

The .get_factors callback of factors_clk has 6 parameters. To extend
factors_clk in any way that requires adding parameters to .get_factors
would make that list even longer, not to mention changing all the
function declarations.

Do this once now and consolidate all the parameters into a struct.
Also drop the space before function pointer arguments, since checkpatch
complains.
