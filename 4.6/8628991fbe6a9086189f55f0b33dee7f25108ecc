IB/srpt: Use a mutex to protect the channel list

In a later patch a function that can block will be called while
iterating over the rch_list. Hence protect that list with a
mutex instead of a spinlock. And since it is not allowed to sleep
while the task state != TASK_RUNNING, convert the list test in
srpt_ch_list_empty() into a lockless test.
