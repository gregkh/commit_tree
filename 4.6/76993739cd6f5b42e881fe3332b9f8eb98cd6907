arm64: KVM: Add helper to handle PMCR register bits

According to ARMv8 spec, when writing 1 to PMCR.E, all counters are
enabled by PMCNTENSET, while writing 0 to PMCR.E, all counters are
disabled. When writing 1 to PMCR.P, reset all event counters, not
including PMCCNTR, to zero. When writing 1 to PMCR.C, reset PMCCNTR to
zero.
