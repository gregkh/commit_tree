net: smc911x: convert pxa dma to dmaengine

Convert the dma transfers to be dmaengine based, now pxa has a dmaengine
slave driver. This makes this driver a bit more PXA agnostic.

The driver was only compile tested. The risk is quite small as no
current PXA platform I'm aware of is using smc911x driver.
