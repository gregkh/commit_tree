PM / sleep: Clear pm_suspend_global_flags upon hibernate

When suspending to RAM, waking up and later suspending to disk,
we gratuitously runtime resume devices after the thaw phase.
This does not occur if we always suspend to RAM or always to disk.

pm_complete_with_resume_check(), which gets called from
pci_pm_complete() among others, schedules a runtime resume
if PM_SUSPEND_FLAG_FW_RESUME is set. The flag is set during
a suspend-to-RAM cycle. It is cleared at the beginning of
the suspend-to-RAM cycle but not afterwards and it is not
cleared during a suspend-to-disk cycle at all. Fix it.
