ACPICA / Interpreter: Fix a regression triggered because of wrong Linux ECDT support

It is reported that the following commit triggers regressions:
 Linux commit: efaed9be998b5ae0afb7458e057e5f4402b43fa0
 ACPICA commit: 31178590dde82368fdb0f6b0e466b6c0add96c57
 Subject: ACPICA: Events: Enhance acpi_ev_execute_reg_method() to
          ensure no _REG evaluations can happen during OS early boot
          stages

This is because that the ECDT support is not corrected in Linux, and Linux
requires to execute _REG for ECDT (though this sounds so wrong), we need to
ensure acpi_gbl_namespace_initialized is set before ECDT probing in order
for _REG to be executed. Since we have to move
"acpi_gbl_namespace_initialized = TRUE" to the initialization step
happening before ECDT probing, acpi_load_tables() is the best candidate for
now. Thus this patch fixes the regression by doing so.

But if the ECDT support is fixed, Linux will not execute _REG for ECDT, and
ECDT probing will happen before acpi_load_tables(). At that time, we still
want to ensure acpi_gbl_namespace_initialized is set after executing
acpi_ns_initialize_objects() (under the condition of
acpi_gbl_group_module_level_code = FALSE), this patch also moves
acpi_ns_initialize_objects() to acpi_load_tables() accordingly.

Since acpi_ns_initialize_objects() doesn't seem to be skippable, this
patch also removes ACPI_NO_OBJECT_INIT for the one invoked in
acpi_load_tables(). And since the default region handlers should always be
installed before loading the tables, this patch also removes useless
acpi_gbl_group_module_level_code check accordingly. Reported by Chris
Bainbridge, Fixed by Lv Zheng.
