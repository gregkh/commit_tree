xfs: xfs_cluster_write is redundant

xfs_cluster_write() is not necessary now that xfs_vm_writepages()
aggregates writepage calls across a single mapping. This means we no
longer need to do page lookups in xfs_cluster_write, so writeback
only needs to look up th epage cache once per page being written.
This also removes a large amount of mostly duplicate code between
xfs_do_writepage() and xfs_convert_page().
