i40e: Removal of code which relies on BASE VEB SEID

Fixed mapping of SEID is removed from specification. Hence
this patch removes code which was using hard coded base VEB SEID.

Changed FCoE code to use "hw->pf_id" to obtain correct "idx"
and verified.

Removed defines for BASE VSI/VEB SEID and BASE_PF_SEID since it
is not used anymore.
