ext4: allow readdir()'s of large empty directories to be interrupted

If a directory has a large number of empty blocks, iterating over all
of them can take a long time, leading to scheduler warnings and users
getting irritated when they can't kill a process in the middle of one
of these long-running readdir operations.  Fix this by adding checks to
ext4_readdir() and ext4_htree_fill_tree().
