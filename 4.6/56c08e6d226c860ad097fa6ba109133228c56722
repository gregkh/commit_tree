powerpc: atomic: Implement acquire/release/relaxed variants for cmpxchg

Implement cmpxchg{,64}_relaxed and atomic{,64}_cmpxchg_relaxed, based on
which _release variants can be built.

To avoid superfluous barriers in _acquire variants, we implement these
operations with assembly code rather use __atomic_op_acquire() to build
them automatically.

For the same reason, we keep the assembly implementation of fully
ordered cmpxchg operations.

However, we don't do the similar for _release, because that will require
putting barriers in the middle of ll/sc loops, which is probably a bad
idea.

Note cmpxchg{,64}_relaxed and atomic{,64}_cmpxchg_relaxed are not
compiler barriers.
