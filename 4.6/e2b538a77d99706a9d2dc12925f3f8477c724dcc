dmaengine: xilinx_vdma: Fix issues with non-parking mode

This patch fixes issues with the Non-parking mode(Cirular mode).
With the  existing driver in cirular mode if we submit frames less than h/w
configured we simply end-up having misconfigured vdma h/w.
This patch fixes this issue by configuring the frame count register.
