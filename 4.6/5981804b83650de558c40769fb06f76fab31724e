rtc: max77686: Use usleep_range() instead of msleep()

Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt suggest to use usleep_range()
instead of msleep() for small msec (1ms - 20ms) since msleep() will
often sleep for 20ms for any value in that range.

This is fine in this case since 16ms is the _minimum_ delay required
by max77686 for an RTC update but by using usleep_range() instead of
msleep(), the driver can support other RTC IP blocks with a shorter
minimum delay (i.e: in the range of usecs instead of msecs).
