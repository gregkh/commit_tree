net: bridge: fix old ioctl unlocked net device walk

get_bridge_ifindices() is used from the old "deviceless" bridge ioctl
calls which aren't called with rtnl held. The comment above says that it is
called with rtnl but that is not really the case.
Here's a sample output from a test ASSERT_RTNL() which I put in
get_bridge_ifindices and executed "brctl show":

Since it only reads bridge ifindices, we can use rcu to safely walk the net
device list. Also remove the wrong rtnl comment above.
