spi: imx: set MX51_ECSPI_CTRL_SMC bit in setup function

Now that the config function knows whether we are doing DMA or not we
can do the necessary register setup in the config function and no longer
have to do this in the trigger function. With this the trigger function
becomes a no-op for DMA, so instead of testing if we are doing DMA or
not in the trigger function we simply no longer call it in the DMA case.
