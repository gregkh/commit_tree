regulator: axp20x: Fix axp22x ldo_io registration error on cold boot

The maximum supported voltage for ldo_io# is 3.3V, but on cold
boot the selector comes up at 0x1f, which maps to 3.8V.

This causes _regulator_get_voltage() to fail with -EINVAL which
causes regulator registration to fail when constrains are used:

[    1.467788] vcc-touchscreen: failed to get the current voltage(-22)
[    1.474209] axp20x-regulator axp20x-regulator: Failed to register ldo_io1
[    1.483363] axp20x-regulator: probe of axp20x-regulator failed with error -22

This commits makes the axp20x regulator driver accept the 0x1f register
value, fixing this.

The datasheet does not guarantee reliable operation above 3.3V, so on
boards where this regulator is used the regulator-max-microvolt setting
must be 3.3V or less.
