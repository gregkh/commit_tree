net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Clear the PDOWN bit on setup

Some of the vendor-specific bootloaders set up this part
of the initialization for us, so this was never added.
However, since upstream bootloaders don't initialize the
chip specifically, they leave the fiber MII's PDOWN flag
set, which means that the CPU port doesn't connect.

This patch checks whether this flag has been clear prior
by something else, and if not make us clear it.
