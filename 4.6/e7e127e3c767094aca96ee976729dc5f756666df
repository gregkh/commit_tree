PCI: Include pci/hotplug Kconfig directly from pci/Kconfig

Include pci/hotplug/Kconfig directly from pci/Kconfig, so arches don't
have to source both pci/Kconfig and pci/hotplug/Kconfig.

Note that this effectively adds pci/hotplug/Kconfig to the following
arches, because they already sourced drivers/pci/Kconfig but they
previously did not source drivers/pci/hotplug/Kconfig:

  alpha
  arm
  avr32
  frv
  m68k
  microblaze
  mn10300
  sparc
  unicore32
