rfkill: Remove obsolete "claim" sysfs interface

This was scheduled to be removed in 2012 by:

 commit 69c86373c6ea1149aa559e6088362d58d8ec8835
 Author: florian@mickler.org <florian@mickler.org>
 Date:   Wed Feb 24 12:05:16 2010 +0100

     Document the rfkill sysfs ABI

     This moves sysfs ABI info from Documentation/rfkill.txt to the
     ABI subfolder and reformats it.

     This also schedules the deprecated sysfs parts to be removed in
     2012 (claim file) and 2014 (state file).
