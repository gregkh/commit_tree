drm/msm/hdmi: Make HDMI core get its PHY

Make HDMI core get its PHY by parsing the "phys" phandle. The core will use
this PHY reference to enable/disable PHY. The driver defers probe until PHY
isn't available.

The DT bindings used here is the same as the one used for PHYs using the
common PHY framework bindings.
