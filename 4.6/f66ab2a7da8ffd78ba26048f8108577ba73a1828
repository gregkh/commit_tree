brcmfmac: add support for 14e4:4365 PCI ID with BCM4366 chipset

On Broadcom ARM routers BCM4366 cards are available with 14e4:4365 ID.
Unfortunately this ID was already used by Broadcom for cards with
BCM43142, a totally different chipset requiring SoftMAC driver. To avoid
a conflict between brcmfmac and bcma use more specific ID entry with
subvendor and subdevice specified.
