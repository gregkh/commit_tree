xfs: reinitialise recycled VFS inode correctly

We are going to keep certain on-disk information in the VFS inode
rather than in a separate XFS specific stucture, so we have to be
careful of the VFS code clearing that information when we
re-initialise reclaimable cached inodes during lookup. If we don't
do this, then we lose critical information from the inode and that
results in corruption being detected.
