kvm/x86: Pass return code of kvm_emulate_hypercall

Pass the return code from kvm_emulate_hypercall on to the caller,
in order to allow it to indicate to the userspace that
the hypercall has to be handled there.

Also adjust all the existing code paths to return 1 to make sure the
hypercall isn't passed to the userspace without setting kvm_run
appropriately.
