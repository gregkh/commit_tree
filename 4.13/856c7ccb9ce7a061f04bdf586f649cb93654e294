bus: brcmstb_gisb: Use register offsets with writes too

This commit corrects the bug introduced in commit f80835875d3d
("bus: brcmstb_gisb: Look up register offsets in a table") such
that gisb_write() translates the register enumeration into an
offset from the base address for writes as well as reads.
