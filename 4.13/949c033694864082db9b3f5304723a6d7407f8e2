KVM: s390: Fix KVM_S390_GET_CMMA_BITS ioctl definition

In case of KVM_S390_GET_CMMA_BITS, the kernel does not only read struct
kvm_s390_cmma_log passed from userspace (which constitutes _IOC_WRITE),
it also writes back a return value (which constitutes _IOC_READ) making
this an _IOWR ioctl instead of _IOW.
