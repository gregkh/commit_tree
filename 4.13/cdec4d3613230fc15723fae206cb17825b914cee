drm/vc4: Expose dma-buf fences for V3D rendering.

This is needed for proper synchronization with display on another DRM
device (pl111 or tinydrm) with buffers produced by vc4 V3D.  Fixes the
new igt vc4_dmabuf_poll testcase, and rendering of one of the glmark2
desktop tests on pl111+vc4.

This doesn't yet introduce waits on another device's fences before
vc4's rendering/display, because I don't have testcases for them.

v2: Reuse dma_fence_free(), retitle commit message to clarify that
    it's not a full dma-buf fencing implementation yet.
