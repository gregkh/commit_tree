drm/i915: Use engine->context_pin() to report the intel_ring

Since unifying ringbuffer/execlist submission to use
engine->pin_context, we ensure that the intel_ring is available before
we start constructing the request. We can therefore move the assignment
of the request->ring to the central i915_gem_request_alloc() and not
require it in every engine->request_alloc() callback. Another small step
towards simplification (of the core, but at a cost of handling error
pointers in less important callers of engine->pin_context).

v2: Rearrange a few branches to reduce impact of PTR_ERR() on gcc's code
generation.
