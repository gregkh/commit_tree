bnxt_en: Do not setup MAC address in bnxt_hwrm_func_qcaps().

bnxt_hwrm_func_qcaps() is called during probe to get all device
resources and it also sets up the factory MAC address.  The same function
is called when SRIOV is disabled to reclaim all resources.  If
the MAC address has been overridden by a user administered MAC
address, calling this function will overwrite it.

Separate the logic that sets up the default MAC address into a new
function bnxt_init_mac_addr() that is only called during probe time.
