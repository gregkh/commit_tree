libnvdimm, label: honor the lba size specified in v1.2 labels

Previously we only honored the lba size for blk-aperture mode
namespaces. For pmem namespaces the lba size was just assumed to be 512.
With the new v1.2 label definition and compatibility with other
operating environments, the ->lbasize property is now respected for pmem
namespaces.
