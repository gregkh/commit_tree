drm/i915: Fix scaling check for 90/270 degree plane rotation

Starting from commit b63a16f6cd89 ("drm/i915: Compute display surface
offset in the plane check hook for SKL+") we've already rotated the src
coordinates by 270 degrees by the time we check if a scaler is needed
or not, so we must not account for the rotation a second time.
Previously we did these steps in the opposite order and hence the
scaler check had to deal with rotation itself. The double rotation
handling causes us to enable a scaler pretty much every time 90/270
degree plane rotation is requested, leading to fuzzier fonts and whatnot.

v2: s/unsigned/unsigned int/ to appease checkpatch
v3: s/DRM_ROTATE_0/DRM_MODE_ROTATE_0/
