drm/vc4: Turn the V3D clock on at runtime.

For the Raspberry Pi's bindings, the power domain also implicitly
turns on the clock and deasserts reset, but for the new Cygnus port we
start representing the clock in the devicetree.

v2: Document the clock-names property, check for -ENOENT for no clock
    in DT.
v3: Drop NULL checks around clk calls which embed NULL checks.
v4: Drop clk-names (feedback by Rob Herring)
