powerpc/mm: Ensure cpumask update is ordered

There is no guarantee that the various isync's involved with
the context switch will order the update of the CPU mask with
the first TLB entry for the new context being loaded by the HW.

Be safe here and add a memory barrier to order any subsequent
load/store which may bring entries into the TLB.

The corresponding barrier on the other side already exists as
pte updates use pte_xchg() which uses __cmpxchg_u64 which has
a sync after the atomic operation.
