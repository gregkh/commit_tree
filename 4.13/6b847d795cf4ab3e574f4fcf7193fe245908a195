powerpc/time: Fix tracing in time.c

Since trace_clock is in a different file and already marked with notrace,
enable tracing in time.c by removing it from the disabled list in Makefile.
Also annotate clocksource read functions and sched_clock with notrace.

Testing: Timer and ftrace selftests run with different trace clocks.
