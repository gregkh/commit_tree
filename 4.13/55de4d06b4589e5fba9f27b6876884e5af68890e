clk: mvebu: ap806: do not depend anymore of the *-clock-output-names

As it was done for the cp110, this patch modifies the way the clock names
are created. The name of each clock is now created by using its physical
address as a prefix (as it was done for the platform device
names). Thanks to this we have an automatic way to compute a unique name.
