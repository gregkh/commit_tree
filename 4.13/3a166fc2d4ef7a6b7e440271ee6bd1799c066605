kbuild: handle libs-y archives separately from built-in.o archives

The thin archives build currently puts all lib.a and built-in.o
files together and links them with --whole-archive.

This works because thin archives can recursively refer to thin
archives. However some architectures include libgcc.a, which may
not be a thin archive, or it may not be constructed with the "P"
option, in which case its contents do not get linked correctly.

So don't pull .a libs into the root built-in.o archive. These
libs should already have symbol tables and indexes built, so they
can be direct linker inputs. Move them out of the --whole-archive
option, which restore the conditional linking behaviour of lib.a
to thin archives builds.
