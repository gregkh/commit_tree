cisco: enic: Fic an error handling path in 'vnic_dev_init_devcmd2()'

if 'ioread32()' returns 0xFFFFFFF, we have to go through the error
handling path as done everywhere else in this function.

Move the 'err_free_wq' label to better match its name and its location
and add a new label 'err_disable_wq'.
Update the code accordingly.
