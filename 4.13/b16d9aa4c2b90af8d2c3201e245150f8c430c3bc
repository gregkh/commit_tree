bpf: Add BPF_PROG_GET_FD_BY_ID

Add BPF_PROG_GET_FD_BY_ID command to allow user to get a fd
from a bpf_prog's ID.

bpf_prog_inc_not_zero() is added and is called with prog_idr_lock
held.

__bpf_prog_put() is also added which has the 'bool do_idr_lock'
param to decide if the prog_idr_lock should be acquired when
freeing the prog->id.

In the error path of bpf_prog_inc_not_zero(), it may have to
call __bpf_prog_put(map, false) which does not need
to take the prog_idr_lock when freeing the prog->id.

It is currently limited to CAP_SYS_ADMIN which we can
consider to lift it in followup patches.
