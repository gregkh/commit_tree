cifs: return ENAMETOOLONG for overlong names in cifs_open()/cifs_lookup()

Add checking for the path component length and verify it is <= the maximum
that the server advertizes via FileFsAttributeInformation.

With this patch cifs.ko will now return ENAMETOOLONG instead of ENOENT
when users to access an overlong path.

To test this, try to cd into a (non-existing) directory on a CIFS share
that has a too long name:
cd /mnt/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

and it now should show a good error message from the shell:
bash: cd: /mnt/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...aaaaaa: File name too long
