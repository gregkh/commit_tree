ibmvnic: Remove VNIC_CLOSING check from pending_scrq

Fix a kernel panic resulting from data access of a NULL
pointer during device close. The pending_scrq routine is
meant to determine whether there is a valid sub-CRQ message
awaiting processing. When the device is closing, however,
there is a possibility that NULL messages can be processed
because pending_scrq will always return 1 even if there
no valid message in the queue.

It's not clear what this closing state check was originally
meant to accomplish, so just remove it.
