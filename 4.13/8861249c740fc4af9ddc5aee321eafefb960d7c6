crypto: x86/sha1 - Fix reads beyond the number of blocks passed

It was reported that the sha1 AVX2 function(sha1_transform_avx2) is
reading ahead beyond its intended data, and causing a crash if the next
block is beyond page boundary:

This patch makes sure that there is no overflow for any buffer length.

It passes the tests written by Jan Stancek that revealed this problem:

I have re-enabled sha1-avx2 by reverting commit
