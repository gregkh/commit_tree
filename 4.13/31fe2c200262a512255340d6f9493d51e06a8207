drm/nouveau/disp/g84-: Extend NVKM HDMI power control method to set InfoFrames

The nouveau driver, in the Linux 3.7 days, used to try and set the
AVI InfoFrame based on the selected display mode.  These days, it
uses a fixed set of InfoFrames.  Start to correct that, by
providing a mechanism whereby InfoFrame data may be passed to the
NVKM functions that do the actual configuration.

At this point, only establish the new parameters and their parsing,
don't actually use the data anywhere yet (since it's not supplied
anywhere).
