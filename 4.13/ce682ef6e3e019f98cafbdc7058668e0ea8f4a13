tcp: fix TCP_SYNCNT flakes

After the mentioned commit, some of our packetdrill tests became flaky.

TCP_SYNCNT socket option can limit the number of SYN retransmits.

retransmits_timed_out() has to compare times computations based on
local_clock() while timers are based on jiffies. With NTP adjustments
and roundings we can observe 999 ms delay for 1000 ms timers.
We end up sending one extra SYN packet.

Gimmick added in commit 6fa12c850314 ("Revert Backoff [v3]: Calculate
TCP's connection close threshold as a time value") makes no
real sense for TCP_SYN_SENT sockets where no RTO backoff can happen at
all.

Lets use a simpler logic for TCP_SYN_SENT sockets and remove @syn_set
parameter from retransmits_timed_out()
