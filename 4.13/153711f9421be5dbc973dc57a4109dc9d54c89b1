rtnetlink: allocate more memory for dev_set_mac_address()

virtnet_set_mac_address() interprets mac address as struct
sockaddr, but upper layer only allocates dev->addr_len
which is ETH_ALEN + sizeof(sa_family_t) in this case.

We lack a unified definition for mac address, so just fix
the upper layer, this also allows drivers to interpret it
to struct sockaddr freely.
