NFS: Use raw NFS access mask in nfs4_opendata_access()

Commit bd8b2441742b ("NFS: Store the raw NFS access mask in the inode's
access cache") changed how the access results are stored after an
access() call.  An NFS v4 OPEN might have access bits returned with the
opendata, so we should use the NFS4_ACCESS values when determining the
return value in nfs4_opendata_access().

access cache")
