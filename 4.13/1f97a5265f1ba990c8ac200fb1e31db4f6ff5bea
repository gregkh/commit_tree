net/mlx5e: Relocate the TC match on ip tos offload code section

The code section for offloading matches on ip tos (L3) should come
before and not after the one that deals with tcp/udp (L4) matches.

Otherwise, we might come up with wrong min-inline requirement, when
one attempts to match on both L3 and L4.
