drm/amdgpu: add sched sync for amdgpu job v2

this is an improvement for previous patch, the sched_sync is to store fence
that could be skipped as scheduled, when job is executed, we didn't need
pipeline_sync if all fences in sched_sync are signalled, otherwise insert
pipeline_sync still.

v2: handle error when adding fence to sync failed.
