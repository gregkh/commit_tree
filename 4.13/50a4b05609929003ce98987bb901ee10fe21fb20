arm64: add missing conversion to __wsum in ip_fast_csum()

ARM64 implementation of ip_fast_csum() do most of the work
in 128 or 64 bit and call csum_fold() to finalize. csum_fold()
itself take a __wsum argument, to insure that this value is
always a 32bit native-order value.

Fix this by adding the sadly needed '__force' to cast the native
'sum' to the type '__wsum'.
