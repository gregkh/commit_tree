ALSA: hda/realtek - change the location for one of two front microphones

On this Lenovo machine, there are two front mics, and both of them are
assigned the same name "Mic", but pulseaudio can't support two mics
with the same name, as a workaround, we change the location for one of
them, then the driver will assign "Front Mic" and "Mic" for them.
