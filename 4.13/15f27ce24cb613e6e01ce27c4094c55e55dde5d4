alarmtimer: Move copyout and freeze handling into alarmtimer_do_nsleep()

The alarmtimer nanosleep() implementation can be simplified by moving the
copy out of the remaining time to alarmtimer_do_nsleep() which is shared
between the real nanosleep function and the restart function.

The pointer to the timespec64 which is updated has to be stored in the
restart block anyway. Instead of storing it only in the restart case, store
it before calling alarmtimer_do_nsleep() and copy the remaining time in the
signal exit path.
