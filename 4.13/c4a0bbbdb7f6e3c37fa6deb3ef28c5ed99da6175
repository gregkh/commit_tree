usb: chipidea: properly handle host or gadget initialization failure

If ci_hdrc_host_init() or ci_hdrc_gadget_init() returns error and the
error != -ENXIO, as Peter pointed out, "it stands for initialization
for host or gadget has failed", so we'd better return failure rather
continue.

And before destroying the otg, i.e ci_hdrc_otg_destroy(ci), we should
also check ci->roles[CI_ROLE_GADGET].
