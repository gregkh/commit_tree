xen/pv: Fix OOPS on restore for a PV, !SMP domain

If CONFIG_SMP is disabled, xen_setup_vcpu_info_placement() is called from
xen_setup_shared_info(). This is fine as far as boot goes, but it means
that we also call it in the restore path. This results in an OOPS
because we assign to pv_mmu_ops.read_cr2 which is __ro_after_init.

Also, though less problematically, this means we call xen_vcpu_setup()
twice at restore -- once from the vcpu info placement call and the
second time from xen_vcpu_restore().

Fix by calling xen_setup_vcpu_info_placement() at boot only.
