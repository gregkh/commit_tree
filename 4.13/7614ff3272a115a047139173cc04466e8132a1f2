powerpc/mm/radix: Implement STRICT_RWX/mark_rodata_ro() for Radix

The Radix linear mapping code (create_physical_mapping()) tries to use
the largest page size it can at each step. Currently the only reason
it steps down to a smaller page size is if the start addr is
unaligned (never happens in practice), or the end of memory is not
aligned to a huge page boundary.

To support STRICT_RWX we need to break the mapping at __init_begin,
so that the text and rodata prior to that can be marked R_X and the
regular pages after can be marked RW.

Having done that we can now implement mark_rodata_ro() for Radix,
knowing that we won't need to split any mappings.
