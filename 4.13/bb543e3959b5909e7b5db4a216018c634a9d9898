integrity: Small code improvements

These changes are too small to warrant their own patches:

The keyid and sig_size members of struct signature_v2_hdr are in BE format,
so use a type that makes this assumption explicit. Also, use beXX_to_cpu
instead of __beXX_to_cpu to read them.

Change integrity_kernel_read to take a void * buffer instead of char *
buffer, so that callers don't have to use a cast if they provide a buffer
that isn't a char *.

Add missing #endif comment in ima.h pointing out which macro it refers to.

Add missing fall through comment in ima_appraise.c.

Constify mask_tokens and func_tokens arrays.
