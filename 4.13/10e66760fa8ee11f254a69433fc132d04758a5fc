x86/smpboot: Unbreak CPU0 hotplug

A hang on CPU0 onlining after a preceding offlining is observed. Trace
shows that CPU0 is stuck in check_tsc_sync_target() waiting for source
CPU to run check_tsc_sync_source() but this never happens. Source CPU,
in its turn, is stuck on synchronize_sched() which is called from
native_cpu_up() -> do_boot_cpu() -> unregister_nmi_handler().

So it's a classic ABBA deadlock, due to the use of synchronize_sched() in
unregister_nmi_handler().

Fix the bug by moving unregister_nmi_handler() from do_boot_cpu() to
native_cpu_up() after cpu onlining is done.
