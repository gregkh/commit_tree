bpf: Add support for changing congestion control

Added support for changing congestion control for SOCK_OPS bpf
programs through the setsockopt bpf helper function. It also adds
a new SOCK_OPS op, BPF_SOCK_OPS_NEEDS_ECN, that is needed for
congestion controls, like dctcp, that need to enable ECN in the
SYN packets.
