iio: multiplexer: new iio category and iio-mux driver

When a multiplexer changes how an iio device behaves (for example
by feeding different signals to an ADC), this driver can be used
to create one virtual iio channel for each multiplexer state.

Depends on the generic multiplexer subsystem.

Cache any ext_info values from the parent iio channel, creating a private
copy of the ext_info attributes for each multiplexer state/channel.
