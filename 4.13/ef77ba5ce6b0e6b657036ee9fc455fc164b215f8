mm, hugetlb, soft_offline: use new_page_nodemask for soft offline migration

new_page is yet another duplication of the migration callback which has
to handle hugetlb migration specially.  We can safely use the generic
new_page_nodemask for the same purpose.

Please note that gigantic hugetlb pages do not need any special handling
because alloc_huge_page_nodemask will make sure to check pages in all
per node pools.  The reason this was done previously was that
alloc_huge_page_node treated NO_NUMA_NODE and a specific node
differently and so alloc_huge_page_node(nid) would check on this
specific node.
