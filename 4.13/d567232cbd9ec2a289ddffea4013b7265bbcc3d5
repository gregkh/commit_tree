drm/i915: use vma->size for appgtt allocate_va_range

For the aliasing ppgtt we clear the va range up to vma->size, but seem
to allocate up to vma->node.size, which is a little inconsistent given
that vma->node.size >= vma->size. Not that is really matters all that
much since we preallocate anyway, but for consistency just use
vma->size.
