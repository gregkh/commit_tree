PCI: Add devm_pci_alloc_host_bridge() interface

Struct pci_host_bridge can be allocated by PCI host bridge drivers which
usually allocate and map memory through devm managed interfaces.

Add a devm version for the pci_alloc_host_bridge() interface to simplify
PCI host controller driver porting and simplify the driver failure paths.
