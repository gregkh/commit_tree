ASoC: hdmi-codec: add .get_dai_id support

ALSA SoC needs to know connected DAI ID for probing.
It is not a big problem if device/driver was only for sound,
but getting DAI ID will be difficult if device includes both
Video/Sound, like HDMI.
To solve this issue, this patch adds new .get_dai_id callback
on hdmi_codec_ops
