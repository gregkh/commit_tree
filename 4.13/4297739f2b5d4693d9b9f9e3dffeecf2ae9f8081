tee.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different format. Some
doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- adjust identation of titles;
- mark ascii artwork as a literal block;
- adjust references.
