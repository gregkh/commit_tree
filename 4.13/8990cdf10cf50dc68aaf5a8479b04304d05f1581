libnvdimm, label: switch to using v1.2 labels by default

The rules for which version of the label specification are in effect at
any given point in time are as follows:

1/ If a DIMM has an existing / valid index block then the version
   specified is used regardless if it is a previous version.

2/ By default when the kernel is initializing new index blocks the
   latest specification version (v1.2 at time of writing) is used.

3/ An environment that wants to force create v1.1 label-sets must
   arrange for userspace to disable all active regions / namespaces /
   dimms and write a valid set of v1.1 index blocks to the dimms.
