ovl: introduce the inodes index dir feature

Create the index dir on mount. The index dir will contain hardlinks to
upper inodes, named after the hex representation of their origin lower
inodes.

The index dir is going to be used to prevent breaking lower hardlinks
on copy up and to implement overlayfs NFS export.

Because the feature is not fully backward compat, enabling the feature
is opt-in by config/module/mount option.
