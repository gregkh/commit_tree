KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add capability to report possible virtual SMT modes

Now that userspace can set the virtual SMT mode by enabling the
KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT capability, it is useful for userspace to be able
to query the set of possible virtual SMT modes.  This provides a
new capability, KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT_POSSIBLE, to provide this
information.  The return value is a bitmap of possible modes, with
bit N set if virtual SMT mode 2^N is available.  That is, 1 indicates
SMT1 is available, 2 indicates that SMT2 is available, 3 indicates
that both SMT1 and SMT2 are available, and so on.
