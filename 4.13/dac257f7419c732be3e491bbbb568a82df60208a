fs: check for writeback errors after syncing out buffers in generic_file_fsync

ext2 currently does a test+clear of the AS_EIO flag, which is
is problematic for some coming changes.

What we really need to do instead is call filemap_check_errors
in __generic_file_fsync after syncing out the buffers. That
will be sufficient for this case, and help other callers detect
these errors properly as well.

With that, we don't need to twiddle it in ext2.
