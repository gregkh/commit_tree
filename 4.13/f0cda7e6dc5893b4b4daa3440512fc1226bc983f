arm64: fix endianness annotation in acpi_parking_protocol.c

Here both variables 'cpu_id' and 'entry_point' are read via
read[lq]_relaxed(), from a little-endian annotated pointer
and then used as a native endian value.

This is correct since the read[lq]() family of function
internally do a little-to-native endian conversion.

But in this case, it is wrong to declare these variable as
little-endian since there are native ones.

Fix this by changing the declaration of these variables
as 'u32' or 'u64' instead of '__le32' / '__le64'.
