Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Add active_low irq polarity quirk for Asus T100CHI

Just like the T100TA the host-wake irq on the Asus T100CHI is
active low. Having a quirk for this is actually extra important on the
T100CHI as it ships with a bluetooth keyboard dock, which does not
work properly without this quirk.
