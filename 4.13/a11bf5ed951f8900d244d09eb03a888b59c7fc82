mtd: nand: Fix timing setup for NANDs that do not support SET FEATURES

Some ONFI NANDs do not support the SET/GET FEATURES commands, which,
according to the spec, is perfectly valid.

On these NANDs we can't set a specific timing mode using the "timing
mode" feature, and we should assume the NAND does not require any setup
to enter a specific timing mode.
