ext4: restructure ext4_expand_extra_isize

Current ext4_expand_extra_isize just tries to expand extra isize, if
someone is holding xattr lock or some check fails, it will give up.
So rename its name to ext4_try_to_expand_extra_isize.

Besides that, we clean up unnecessary check and move some relative checks
into it.
