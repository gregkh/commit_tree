genirq/cpuhotplug: Use effective affinity mask

If the architecture supports the effective affinity mask, migrating
interrupts away which are not targeted by the effective mask is
pointless.

They can stay in the user or system supplied affinity mask, but won't be
targetted at any given point as the affinity setter functions need to
validate against the online cpu mask anyway.
