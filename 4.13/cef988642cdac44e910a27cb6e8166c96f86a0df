staging: comedi: comedi_fops: do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING

Comedi's read and write file operation handlers (`comedi_read()` and
`comedi_write()`) currently call `copy_to_user()` or `copy_from_user()`
whilst in the `TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE` state, which falls foul of the
`might_fault()` checks when enabled.  Fix it by setting the current task
state back to `TASK_RUNNING` a bit earlier before calling these
functions.
