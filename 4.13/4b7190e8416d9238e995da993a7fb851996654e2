samples/bpf: Fix tracex5 to work with MIPS syscalls.

There are two problems:

1) In MIPS the __NR_* macros expand to an expression, this causes the
   sections of the object file to be named like:

  .
  .
  .
  [ 5] kprobe/(5000 + 1) PROGBITS        0000000000000000 000160 ...
  [ 6] kprobe/(5000 + 0) PROGBITS        0000000000000000 000258 ...
  [ 7] kprobe/(5000 + 9) PROGBITS        0000000000000000 000348 ...
  .
  .
  .

The fix here is to use the "asm_offsets" trick to evaluate the macros
in the C compiler and generate a header file with a usable form of the
macros.

2) MIPS syscall numbers start at 5000, so we need a bigger map to hold
the sub-programs.
