drm/i915/perf: better pipeline aged/aging tail updates

This updates the tail pointer race workaround handling to updating the
'aged' pointer before looking to start aging a new one. There's the
possibility that there is already new data available and so we can
immediately start aging a new pointer without having to first wait for a
later hrtimer callback (and then another to age).
