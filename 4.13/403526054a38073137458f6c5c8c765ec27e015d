kvm: nVMX: Check memory operand to INVVPID

The memory operand fetched for INVVPID is 128 bits. Bits 63:16 are
reserved and must be zero.  Otherwise, the instruction fails with
VMfail(Invalid operand to INVEPT/INVVPID).  If the INVVPID_TYPE is 0
(individual address invalidation), then bits 127:64 must be in
canonical form, or the instruction fails with VMfail(Invalid operand
to INVEPT/INVVPID).
