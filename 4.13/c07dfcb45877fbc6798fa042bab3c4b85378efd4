mbcache: make mbcache naming more generic

Make names more generic so that mbcache usage is not limited to
block sharing. In a subsequent patch in the series
("ext4: xattr inode deduplication"), we start using the mbcache code
for sharing xattr inodes. With that patch, old mb_cache_entry.e_block
field could be holding either a block number or an inode number.
