sched/wait: Standardize wait_bit_queue naming

So wait-bit-queue head variables are often named:

	struct wait_bit_queue *q

... which is a bit ambiguous and super confusing, because
they clearly suggest wait-queue head semantics and behavior
(they rhyme with the old wait_queue_t *q naming), while they
are extended wait-queue _entries_, not heads!

They are misnomers in two ways:

 - the 'wait_bit_queue' leaves open the question of whether
   it's an entry or a head

 - the 'q' parameter and local variable naming falsely implies
   that it's a 'queue' - while it's an entry.

This resulted in sometimes confusing cases such as:

	finish_wait(wq, &q->wait);

where the 'q' is not a wait-queue head, but a wait-bit-queue entry.

So improve this all by standardizing wait-bit-queue nomenclature
similar to wait-queue head naming:

	struct wait_bit_queue   => struct wait_bit_queue_entry
	q			=> wbq_entry

Which makes it all a much clearer:

	struct wait_bit_queue_entry *wbq_entry

... and turns the former confusing piece of code into:

	finish_wait(wq_head, &wbq_entry->wq_entry;

which IMHO makes it apparently clear what we are doing,
without having to analyze the context of the code: we are
adding a wait-queue entry to a regular wait-queue head,
which entry is embedded in a wait-bit-queue entry.

I'm not a big fan of acronyms, but repeating wait_bit_queue_entry
in field and local variable names is too long, so Hopefully it's
clear enough that 'wq_' prefixes stand for wait-queues, while
'wbq_' prefixes stand for wait-bit-queues.
