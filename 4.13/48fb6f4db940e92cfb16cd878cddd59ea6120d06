futex: Remove unnecessary warning from get_futex_key

Commit 65d8fc777f6d ("futex: Remove requirement for lock_page() in
get_futex_key()") removed an unnecessary lock_page() with the
side-effect that page->mapping needed to be treated very carefully.

Two defensive warnings were added in case any assumption was missed and
the first warning assumed a correct application would not alter a
mapping backing a futex key.  Since merging, it has not triggered for
any unexpected case but Mark Rutland reported the following bug
triggering due to the first warning.

The fact that it's a bug instead of a warning was due to an unrelated
arm64 problem, but the warning itself triggered because the underlying
mapping changed.

This is an application issue but from a kernel perspective it's a
recoverable situation and the warning is unnecessary so this patch
removes the warning.  The warning may potentially be triggered with the
following test program from Mark although it may be necessary to adjust
NR_FUTEX_THREADS to be a value smaller than the number of CPUs in the
system.

    {
        syscall(SYS_futex, uaddr, op, val, timeout, uaddr2, val3);
    }

    void *poll_futex(void *unused)
    {
        for (;;) {
            futex_wrapper(mem, FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI, 1, NULL, mem + 4, 1);
        }
    }

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        int i;

        mem = mmap(NULL, MEM_SIZE, MEM_PROT,
               MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);

        printf("Mapping @ %p\n", mem);

        printf("Creating futex threads...\n");

        for (i = 0; i < NR_FUTEX_THREADS; i++)
            pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, poll_futex, NULL);

        printf("Flipping mapping...\n");
        for (;;) {
            mmap(mem, MEM_SIZE, MEM_PROT,
                 MAP_FIXED | MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
        }

        return 0;
    }
