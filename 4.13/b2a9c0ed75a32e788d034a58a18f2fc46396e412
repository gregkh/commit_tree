net: remove DST_NOGC flag

Now that all the components have been changed to release dst based on
refcnt only and not depend on dst gc anymore, we can remove the
temporary flag DST_NOGC.

Note that we also need to remove the DST_NOCACHE check in dst_release()
and dst_hold_safe() because now all the dst are released based on refcnt
and behaves as DST_NOCACHE.
