dm: don't return errnos from ->map

Instead use the special DM_MAPIO_KILL return value to return -EIO just
like we do for the request based path.  Note that dm-log-writes returned
-ENOMEM in a few places, which now becomes -EIO instead.  No consumer
treats -ENOMEM special so this shouldn't be an issue (and it should
use a mempool to start with to make guaranteed progress).
