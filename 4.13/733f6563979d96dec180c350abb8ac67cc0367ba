i2c: designware: Remove needless pm_runtime_put_noidle() call

I guess pm_runtime_put_noidle() call in i2c_dw_probe_slave() was copied
by accident from similar master mode adapter registration code. It is
unbalanced due missing pm_runtime_get_noresume() but harmless since it
doesn't decrease dev->power.usage_count below zero.

In theory we can hit similar needless runtime suspend/resume cycle
during slave mode adapter registration that was happening when
registering the master mode adapter. See commit cd998ded5c12 ("i2c:
designware: Prevent runtime suspend during adapter registration").

However, since we are slave, we can consider it as a wrong configuration
if we have other slaves attached under this adapter and can omit the
pm_runtime_get_noresume()/pm_runtime_put_noidle() calls for simplicity.
