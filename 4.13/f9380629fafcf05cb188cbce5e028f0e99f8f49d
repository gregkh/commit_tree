nfp: advertise support for NFD ABI 0.5

NFD ABI 0.5 is equivalent to NFD ABI 3.0 but requires that the
driver checks the APP id symbol and makes sure it can support
given app.  Most advanced apps will likely require control vNIC
(ability to exchange control messages between the driver and
app FW).  Detailed app version checking and capability exchange
is left to app-specific code.
