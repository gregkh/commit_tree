crypto: caam - properly set IV after {en,de}crypt

Certain cipher modes like CTS expect the IV (req->info) of
ablkcipher_request (or equivalently req->iv of skcipher_request) to
contain the last ciphertext block when the {en,de}crypt operation is done.
This is currently not the case for the CAAM driver which in turn breaks
e.g. cts(cbc(aes)) when the CAAM driver is enabled.

This patch fixes the CAAM driver to properly set the IV after the
{en,de}crypt operation of ablkcipher finishes.

This issue was revealed by the changes in the SW CTS mode in commit
0605c41cc53ca ("crypto: cts - Convert to skcipher")
