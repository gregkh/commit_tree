net/mlx5: Fix arm SRQ command for ISSI version 0

Support for ISSI version 0 was recently broken as the arm_srq_cmd
command, which is used only for ISSI version 0, was given the opcode
for ISSI version 1 instead of ISSI version 0.

Change arm_srq_cmd to use the correct command opcode for ISSI version
0.
