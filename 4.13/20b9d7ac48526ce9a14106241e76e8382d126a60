bpf: avoid excessive stack usage for perf_sample_data

perf_sample_data consumes 386 bytes on stack, reduce excessive stack
usage and move it to per cpu buffer. It's allowed due to preemption
being disabled for tracing, xdp and tc programs, thus at all times
only one program can run on a specific CPU and programs cannot run
from interrupt. We similarly also handle bpf_pt_regs.
