cpuset: Fix incorrect memory_pressure control file mapping

The memory_pressure control file was incorrectly set up without
a private value (0, by default). As a result, this control
file was treated like memory_migrate on read. By adding back the
FILE_MEMORY_PRESSURE private value, the correct memory pressure value
will be returned.
