tty: define tty_open_by_driver when CONFIG_TTY is not defined

This patch adds definition of tty_open_by_driver when CONFIG_TTY is not
defined. This was supposed to have been included in commit
12e84c71b7d4ee38d51377fd494ac748ee4e6912 ("tty: export
tty_open_by_driver"). The patch follows convention for other such
functions and returns NULL.
