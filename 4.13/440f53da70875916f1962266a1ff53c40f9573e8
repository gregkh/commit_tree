ACPI / EC: Fix media keys not working problem on some Asus laptops

Some Asus laptops (verified on X550VXK/FX502VD/FX502VE) get no
interrupts when pressing media keys thus the corresponding functions
are not invoked. It's due to the _GPE defines in DSDT for EC returns
differnt value compared to the GPE Number in ECDT. Confirmed with Asus
that the vale in ECDT is the correct one. This commit uses DMI quirks
to prevent calling _GPE when doing ec_parse_device() and keep the ECDT
GPE number setting for the EC device.

With previous commit, it is ensured that if there is an ECDT, it can
always be kept as boot_ec, this patch thus can implement a quirk on
top of the determined ECDT boot_ec.
