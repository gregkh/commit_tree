drm/atomic: Handle -EDEADLK with out-fences correctly

complete_crtc_signaling is freeing fence_state, but when retrying
num_fences and fence_state are not zero'd. This caused duplicate
fd's in the fence_state array, followed by a BUG_ON in fs/file.c
because we reallocate freed memory, and installing over an existing
fd, or potential other fun.

Zero fence_state and num_fences correctly in the retry loop, which
allows kms_atomic_transition to pass.
