regulator: da9061: BUCK and LDO regulator driver

Regulator support for the DA9061 is added into the DA9062 regulator driver.

The regulators for DA9061 differ from those of DA9062.
A new DA9061 enumeration list for the LDOs and Bucks supported by this
device is added. Regulator information added: the old regulator
information for DA9062 is renamed from local_regulator_info[] to
local_da9062_regulator_info[] and a new array is added to support
local_da9061_regulator_info[].

The probe() function switches on the da9062_compatible_types enumeration
and configures the correct da9062_regulator_info array and number of
regulator entries.

Kconfig is updated to reflect support for DA9061 and DA9062 regulators.
