platform/x86: intel_cht_int33fe: Set supplied-from property on max17047 dev

Devices with the intel_cht_int33fe ACPI device use a max17047 fuel-gauge
combined with a bq24272i charger, in order for the fuel-gauge driver to
correctly display charging / discharging status it needs to know which
charger is supplying the battery.

This commit sets the supplied-from device property to the name of the
bq24272i charger for this.
