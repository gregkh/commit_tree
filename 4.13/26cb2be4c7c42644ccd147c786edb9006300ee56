mmc: sunxi: Keep default timing phase settings for new timing mode

The register for the "new timing mode" also has bit fields for setting
output and sample timing phases. According to comments in Allwinner's
BSP kernel, the default values are good enough.

Keep the default values already in the hardware when setting new timing
mode, instead of overwriting the whole register.

controllers")
