ASoC: da7213: Update driver to use device_property* FW functions

The driver now supports ACPI based initialisation as well as DT
and old pdata methods. However the FW data handling still uses
DT specific calls to read firmware data (of_property*) so for
ACPI based initialisation the FW data will only be set to default
values. This patch updates the FW handling to use device_property*
calls instead so that both ACPI and DT are handled as expected.
