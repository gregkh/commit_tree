ASoC: sun4i-codec: Add support for V3s codec

The codec in the V3s is similar to the one found on the A31. One key
difference is the analog path controls are routed through the PRCM
block. This is supported by the sun8i-codec-analog driver, and tied
into this codec driver with the audio card's aux_dev.

In addition, the V3s does not have LINEIN, LINEOUT, MBIAS and MIC2,
MIC3, and the FIFO related registers are like H3.
