crypto: caam - fix gfp allocation flags (part I)

Changes in the SW cts (ciphertext stealing) code in
commit 0605c41cc53ca ("crypto: cts - Convert to skcipher")
revealed a problem in the CAAM driver:
when cts(cbc(aes)) is executed and cts runs in SW,
cbc(aes) is offloaded in CAAM; cts encrypts the last block
in atomic context and CAAM incorrectly decides to use GFP_KERNEL
for memory allocation.

Fix this by allowing GFP_KERNEL (sleeping) only when MAY_SLEEP flag is
set, i.e. remove MAY_BACKLOG flag.

We split the fix in two parts - first is sent to -stable, while the
second is not (since there is no known failure case).
