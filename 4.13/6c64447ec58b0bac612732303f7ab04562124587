x86/xen/efi: Initialize only the EFI struct members used by Xen

The current approach, which is the wholesale efi struct initialization from
a 'efi_xen' local template is not robust. Usually if new member is defined
then it is properly initialized in drivers/firmware/efi/efi.c, but not in
arch/x86/xen/efi.c.

The effect is that the Xen initialization clears any fields the generic code
might have set and the Xen code does not know about yet.

I saw this happen a few times, so let's initialize only the EFI struct members
used by Xen and maintain no local duplicate, to avoid such issues in the future.
