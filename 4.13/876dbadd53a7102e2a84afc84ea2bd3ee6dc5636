net: bcmgenet: Fix unmapping of fragments in bcmgenet_xmit()

In case we fail to map a single fragment, we would be leaving the
transmit ring populated with stale entries.

This commit introduces the helper function bcmgenet_put_txcb()
which takes care of rewinding the per-ring write pointer back to
where we left.

It also consolidates the functionality of bcmgenet_xmit_single()
and bcmgenet_xmit_frag() into the bcmgenet_xmit() function to
make the unmapping of control blocks cleaner.
