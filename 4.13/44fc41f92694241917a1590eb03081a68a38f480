ARM: s3c64xx: Do not select ARM_AMBA from S3C64XX_PL080

While trying a fix a build warning unrelated to s3c64xx, I ran into
a circular dependency:

drivers/i2c/Kconfig:7: symbol I2C is selected by FB_DDC
drivers/video/fbdev/Kconfig:63: symbol FB_DDC is selected by FB_CYBER2000_DDC
drivers/video/fbdev/Kconfig:381: symbol FB_CYBER2000_DDC depends on FB_CYBER2000
drivers/video/fbdev/Kconfig:369: symbol FB_CYBER2000 depends on FB
drivers/video/fbdev/Kconfig:5: symbol FB is selected by DRM_KMS_FB_HELPER
drivers/gpu/drm/Kconfig:72: symbol DRM_KMS_FB_HELPER is selected by DRM_KMS_CMA_HELPER
drivers/gpu/drm/Kconfig:137: symbol DRM_KMS_CMA_HELPER is selected by DRM_PL111
drivers/gpu/drm/pl111/Kconfig:1: symbol DRM_PL111 depends on ARM_AMBA
drivers/amba/Kconfig:1: symbol ARM_AMBA is selected by S3C64XX_PL080
arch/arm/mach-s3c64xx/Kconfig:42: symbol S3C64XX_PL080 default value contains DMADEVICES
drivers/dma/Kconfig:5: symbol DMADEVICES is selected by SND_SOC_SH4_SIU
sound/soc/sh/Kconfig:29: symbol SND_SOC_SH4_SIU is selected by SND_SIU_MIGOR
sound/soc/sh/Kconfig:59: symbol SND_SIU_MIGOR depends on I2C

The I2C and FB dependencies are hard to untangle, but I notice that
S3C64XX_PL080 selecting ARM_AMBA is one piece of the puzzle that
can easily be avoided, as ARCH_S3C64XX already select ARM_AMBA.
Removing the redundant 'select' now can help us in the future if we
run into a variation of the same dependency.
