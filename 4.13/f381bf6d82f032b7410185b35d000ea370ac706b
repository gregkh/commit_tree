MIPS: Add support for eBPF JIT.

Since the eBPF machine has 64-bit registers, we only support this in
64-bit kernels.  As of the writing of this commit log test-bpf is showing:

  test_bpf: Summary: 316 PASSED, 0 FAILED, [308/308 JIT'ed]

All current test cases are successfully compiled.

Many examples in samples/bpf are usable, specifically tracex5 which
uses tail calls works.
