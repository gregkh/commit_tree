PCI: imx6: Add regulator support

Some boards might require to control a regulator to power the PCIe port.

Add support for an optional regulator defined in Device Tree linked in the
PCIe controller under `vpcie-supply`.  If present, the regulator will be
disabled and then enabled as part of the PCIe host initialization process
and will be disabled when shutting down.
