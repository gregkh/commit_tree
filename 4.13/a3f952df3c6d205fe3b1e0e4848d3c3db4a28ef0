powerpc: Tweak copy selection parameter in __copy_tofrom_user_power7()

Experiments with the netperf benchmark indicated that the size selecting
VMX-based copies in __copy_tofrom_user_power7() was suboptimal on POWER8.
Measurements showed that parity was in the neighbourhood of 3328 bytes,
rather than greater than 4096. The change gives a 1.5-2.0% improvement in
performance for 4096-byte buffers, reducing the relative time spent in
__copy_tofrom_user_power7() from approximately 7% to approximately 5% in
the TCP_RR benchmark.
