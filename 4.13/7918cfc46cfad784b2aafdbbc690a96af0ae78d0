firmware: google: memconsole: Make memconsole interface more flexible

This patch redesigns the interface between the generic memconsole driver
and its implementations to become more flexible than a flat memory
buffer with unchanging bounds. This allows memconsoles like coreboot's
to include lines that were added by runtime firmware after the driver
was initialized. Since the console log size is thus no longer static,
this means that the /sys/firmware/log file has to become unseekable.
