usb: gadget: add f_uac1 variant based on a new u_audio api

This patch adds a new function 'f_uac1'
(f_uac1 with virtual "ALSA card") that
uses recently created u_audio API. Comparing
to legacy f_uac1 function implementation it
doesn't require any real Audio codec to be
present on the device. In f_uac1 audio
streams are simply sinked to and sourced
from a virtual ALSA sound card created
using u_audio API.

Legacy f_uac1 approach is to write audio
samples directly to existing ALSA sound
card

f_uac1 approach is more generic/flexible
one - create an ALSA sound card that
represents USB Audio function and allows to
be used by userspace application that
may choose to do whatever it wants with the
data received from the USB Host and choose
to provide whatever it wants as audio data
to the USB Host.

f_uac1 also has capture support (gadget->host)
thanks to easy implementation via u_audio.
By default, capture interface has 48000kHz/2ch
configuration, same as playback channel has.

f_uac1 descriptors naming convention
uses f_uac2 driver naming convention that
makes it more common and meaningful.

Comparing to f_uac1_legacy, the f_uac1 doesn't
have volume/mute functionality. This is because
the f_uac1 volume/mute feature unit was dummy
implementation since that driver creation (2009)
and never had any real volume control or mute
functionality, so there is no any difference
here.

Since f_uac1 functionality, exposed
interface to userspace (virtual ALSA card),
input parameters are so different comparing
to f_uac1_legacy, that there is no any
reason to keep them in the same file/module,
and separate function was created.

g_audio can be built using one of existing
UAC functions (f_uac1, f_uac1_legacy or f_uac2)
