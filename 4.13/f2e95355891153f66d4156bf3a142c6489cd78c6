udf: Fix deadlock between writeback and udf_setsize()

udf_setsize() called truncate_setsize() with i_data_sem held. Thus
truncate_pagecache() called from truncate_setsize() could lock a page
under i_data_sem which can deadlock as page lock ranks below
i_data_sem - e. g. writeback can hold page lock and try to acquire
i_data_sem to map a block.

Fix the problem by moving truncate_setsize() calls from under
i_data_sem. It is safe for us to change i_size without holding
i_data_sem as all the places that depend on i_size being stable already
hold inode_lock.
