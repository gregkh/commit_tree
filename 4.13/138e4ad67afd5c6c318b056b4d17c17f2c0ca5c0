epoll: fix race between ep_poll_callback(POLLFREE) and ep_free()/ep_remove()

The race was introduced by me in commit 971316f0503a ("epoll:
ep_unregister_pollwait() can use the freed pwq->whead").  I did not
realize that nothing can protect eventpoll after ep_poll_callback() sets
->whead = NULL, only whead->lock can save us from the race with
ep_free() or ep_remove().

Move ->whead = NULL to the end of ep_poll_callback() and add the
necessary barriers.

TODO: cleanup the ewake/EPOLLEXCLUSIVE logic, it was confusing even
before this patch.

Hopefully this explains use-after-free reported by syzcaller:

	BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in debug_spin_lock_before

	 _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x4a/0x60 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:159
	 ep_poll_callback+0x29f/0xff0 fs/eventpoll.c:1148

this is spin_lock(eventpoll->lock),
