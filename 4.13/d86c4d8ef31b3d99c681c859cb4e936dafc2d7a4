nvme: move reset workqueue handling to common code

This moves the nvme_reset function from the PCIe driver to common code,
renaming it to nvme_reset_ctrl in the process.  Additionally a new
helper nvme_reset_ctrl_sync is added for the case where we want to
wait for the reset.  To facilitate that the reset_work work structure is
move to the common nvme_ctrl structure and the ->reset_ctrl method is
removed.  For now the drivers initialize the reset_work with their own
callback, but longer term we should move to callouts for specific
parts of the reset process and move even more code to the core.
