nvme-rdma: remove race conditions from IB signalling

This patch improves the way the RDMA IB signalling is done by using atomic
operations for the signalling variable. This avoids race conditions on
sig_count.

The signalling interval changes slightly and is now the largest power of
two not larger than queue depth / 2.

ilog() usage idea by Bart Van Assche.
