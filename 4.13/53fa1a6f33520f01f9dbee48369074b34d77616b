hv_netvsc: Fix the carrier state error when data path is off

When the VF NIC is opened, the synthetic NIC's carrier state is set to
off. This tells the host to transitions data path to the VF device. But
if startup script or user manipulates the admin state of the netvsc
device directly for example:
        # ifconfig eth0 down
	# ifconfig eth0 up
Then the carrier state of the synthetic NIC would be on, even though the
data path was still over the VF NIC. This patch sets the carrier state
of synthetic NIC with consideration of the related VF state.
