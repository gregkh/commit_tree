Make statfs properly return read-only state after emergency remount

Emergency remount (sysrq-u) sets MS_RDONLY to the superblock but doesn't set
MNT_READONLY to the mount point.

Once calculate_f_flags() only check for the mount point read only state,
when setting kstatfs flags, after an emergency remount, statfs does not
report the filesystem as read-only, even though it is.

Enable flags_by_sb() to also check for superblock read only state, so the
kstatfs and consequently statfs can properly show the read-only state of
the filesystem.
