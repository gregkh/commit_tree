Input: add support for the STMicroelectronics FingerTip touchscreen

The stmfts (ST-Microelectronics FingerTip S) touchscreen device is a
capacitive multi-touch controller mainly for mobile use.  It's connected
through i2c bus at the address 0x49 and it interfaces with userspace
through input event interface.

At the current state it provides a touchscreen multitouch functionality up
to 10 fingers. Each finger is enumerated with a distinctive id (from 0 to
9).

If enabled the device can support single "touch" hovering, by providing
three coordinates, x, y and distance.

It is possible to select the touchkey functionality which provides a basic
two keys interface for "home" and "back" menu, typical in mobile phones.
