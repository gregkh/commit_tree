NFC: Add sockaddr length checks before accessing sa_family in bind handlers

Verify that the caller-provided sockaddr structure is large enough to
contain the sa_family field, before accessing it in bind() handlers of the
AF_NFC socket. Since the syscall doesn't enforce a minimum size of the
corresponding memory region, very short sockaddrs (zero or one byte long)
result in operating on uninitialized memory while referencing .sa_family.
