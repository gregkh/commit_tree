perf intel-pt: Ensure never to set 'last_ip' when packet 'count' is zero

Intel PT uses IP compression based on the last IP. For decoding purposes,
'last IP' is not updated when a branch target has been suppressed, which is
indicated by IPBytes == 0. IPBytes is stored in the packet 'count', so
ensure never to set 'last_ip' when packet 'count' is zero.
