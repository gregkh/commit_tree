serial: Delete dead code for CIR serial ports

Commit e4fda3a04275 ("serial: don't register CIR serial ports") adds a
check for PORT_8250_CIR to serial8250_register_8250_port(). But the code
isn't needed as the function never takes the branch when the port is CIR
serial port.

This patch deletes the dead code.
