bpf: extend bpf_trace_printk to support %i

Currently, bpf_trace_printk does not support common formatting
symbol '%i' however vsprintf does and is what eventually gets
called by bpf helper. If users are used to '%i' and currently
make use of it, then bpf_trace_printk will just return with
error without dumping anything to the trace pipe, so just add
support for '%i' to the helper.
