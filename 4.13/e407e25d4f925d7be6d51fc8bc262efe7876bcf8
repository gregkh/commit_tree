ARM: sun8i: a83t: Drop leading zeroes from device node addresses

Kbuild now complains about leading zeroes in the address portion of
device node names.

Get rid of them all, except for the uart device node. U-boot currently
hard codes the device node path. We can remove the leading zero for
the uart once we teach U-boot to use the aliases or stdout-path
property.
