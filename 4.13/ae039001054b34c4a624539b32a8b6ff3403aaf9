xen/vcpu: Handle xen_vcpu_setup() failure at boot

On PVH, PVHVM, at failure in the VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info hypercall
we limit the number of cpus to to MAX_VIRT_CPUS. However, if this
failure had occurred for a cpu beyond MAX_VIRT_CPUS, we continue
to function with > MAX_VIRT_CPUS.

This leads to problems at the next save/restore cycle when there
are > MAX_VIRT_CPUS threads going into stop_machine() but coming
back up there's valid state for only the first MAX_VIRT_CPUS.

This patch pulls the excess CPUs down via cpu_down().
