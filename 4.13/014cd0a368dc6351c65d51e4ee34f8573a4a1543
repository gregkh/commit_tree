bpf: Update sysctl documentation to list all supported architectures

The sysctl documentation states that the JIT is only available on
x86_64, which is no longer correct.

Update the list, and break it out to indicate which architectures
support the cBPF JIT (via HAVE_CBPF_JIT) or the eBPF JIT
(HAVE_EBPF_JIT).
