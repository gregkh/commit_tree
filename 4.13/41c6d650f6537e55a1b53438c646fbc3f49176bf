net: convert sock.sk_refcnt from atomic_t to refcount_t

refcount_t type and corresponding API should be
used instead of atomic_t when the variable is used as
a reference counter. This allows to avoid accidental
refcounter overflows that might lead to use-after-free
situations.

This patch uses refcount_inc_not_zero() instead of
atomic_inc_not_zero_hint() due to absense of a _hint()
version of refcount API. If the hint() version must
be used, we might need to revisit API.
