s390: rename struct psw_bits members

Rename a couple of the struct psw_bits members so it is more obvious
for what they are good. Initially I thought using the single character
names from the PoP would be sufficient and obvious, but admittedly
that is not true.

The current implementation is not easy to use, if one has to look into
the source file to figure out which member represents the 'per' bit
(which is the 'r' member).

Therefore rename the members to sane names that are identical to the
uapi psw mask defines:

r -> per
i -> io
e -> ext
t -> dat
m -> mcheck
w -> wait
p -> pstate
