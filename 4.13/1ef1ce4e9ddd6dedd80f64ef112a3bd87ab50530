spmi: pmic-arb: fix inconsistent use of apid and chan

The driver currently uses "apid" and "chan" to mean apid. Remove
the use of chan and use only apid.

On a SPMI bus there is allocation to manage up to 4K peripherals.
However, in practice only few peripherals are instantiated
and only few among the instantiated ones actually interrupt.

APID is CPU's way of keeping track of peripherals that could interrupt.
There is a table that maps the 256 interrupting peripherals to
a number between 0 and 255. This number is called APID. Information about
that interrupting peripheral is stored in registers offset by its
corresponding apid.
