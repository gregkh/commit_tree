ALSA: pcm: Apply power lock globally to common ioctls

All PCM common ioctls should run only in the powered up state, but
currently only a few ioctls do the proper snd_power_lock() and
snd_power_wait() invocations.  Instead of adding to each place, do it
commonly in the caller side, so that all these ioctls are assured to
be operated at the power up state.
