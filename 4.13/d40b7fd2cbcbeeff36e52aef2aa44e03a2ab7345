PCI: Mark Intel XXV710 NIC INTx masking as broken

Just like the other XL710 and X710 variants, the XXV710 device IDs appear
to have the same hardware bug, the status register doesn't report pending
interrupts resulting in "irq xx: nobody cared..." errors from the spurious
interrupt handler when we try to use it with device assignment.
