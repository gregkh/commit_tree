powerpc/64: Avoid restore_math call if possible in syscall exit

The syscall exit code that branches to restore_math is quite heavy on
Book3S, consisting of 2 mtmsr instructions. Threads that don't use both
FP and vector can get caught here if the kernel ever uses FP or vector.
Lazy-FP/vec context switching also trips this case.

So check for lazy FP and vector before switching RI for restore_math.
Move most of this case out of line.

For threads that do want to restore math registers, the MSR switches are
still suboptimal. Future direction may be to use a soft-RI bit to avoid
MSR switches in kernel (similar to soft-EE), but for now at least the
no-restore

POWER9 context switch rate increases by about 5% due to sched_yield(2)
return performance. I haven't constructed a test to measure the syscall
cost.
