perf intel-pt: Add default config for pass-through branch enable

Branch tracing is enabled by default, so a fake config bit called 'pt'
(pass-through) was added to allow the 'branch enable' bit to have affect.
Add default config 'pt,branch' which will allow users to disable branch
tracing using 'branch=0' instead of having to specify 'pt,branch=0'.
