cdrom: Check SCSI passthrough support before reading audio

The CDROMREADAUDIO ioctl uses SCSI passthrough when the .disk
pointer has been set in struct cdrom_device_info. Hence check
whether SCSI passthrough is supported before submitting a SCSI
command. Note: both the ide-cd and sr drivers set the disk
pointer in struct cdrom_device_info but neither the pcd nor
the gdrom driver sets that pointer.
