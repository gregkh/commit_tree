net: phy: dp83867: add workaround for incorrect RX_CTRL pin strap

The data manual for DP83867IR/CR, SNLS484E[1], revised march 2017,
advises that strapping RX_DV/RX_CTRL pin in mode 1 and 2 is not
supported (see note below Table 5 (4-Level Strap Pins)).

There are some boards which have the pin strapped this way and need
software workaround suggested by the data manual. Bit[7] of
Configuration Register 4 (address 0x0031) must be cleared to 0. This
ensures proper operation of the PHY.

Implement driver support for device-tree property meant to advertise
the wrong strapping.
