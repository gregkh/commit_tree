iio: hid-sensor-rotation: Add relative orientation sensor hid support

Relative orientation(AG) sensor is a 6dof orientation sensor,
it depends on acceleration and gyroscope sensor data. It gives
a quaternion describing the orientation of the device relative
to an initial orientation. It is a standard HID sensor.

More information can be found in:
http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/HUTRR59_-_Usages_for_Wearables.pdf

Relative orientation(AG) sensor and dev rotation sensor have same
channels and share channel usage id. So the most of the code for
relative orientation sensor can be reused.
