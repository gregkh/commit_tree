mm, shmem: fix handling /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled

/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled controls if we want
to allocate huge pages when allocate pages for private in-kernel shmem
mount.

Unfortunately, as Dan noticed, I've screwed it up and the only way to
make kernel allocate huge page for the mount is to use "force" there.
All other values will be effectively ignored.
