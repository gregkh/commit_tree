bpf: Sample bpf program to set sndcwnd clamp

Sample BPF program, tcp_clamp_kern.c, to demostrate the use
of setting the sndcwnd clamp. This program assumes that if the
first 5.5 bytes of the host's IPv6 addresses are the same, then
the hosts are in the same datacenter and sets sndcwnd clamp to
100 packets, SYN and SYN-ACK RTOs to 10ms and send/receive buffer
sizes to 150KB.
