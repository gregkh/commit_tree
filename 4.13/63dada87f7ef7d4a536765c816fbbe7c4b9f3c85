platform/x86: Add driver for ACPI INT0002 Virtual GPIO device

Some peripherals on Bay Trail and Cherry Trail platforms signal a
Power Management Event (PME) to the Power Management Controller (PMC)
to wakeup the system. When this happens software needs to explicitly
clear the PME bus 0 status bit in the GPE0a_STS register to avoid an
IRQ storm on IRQ 9.

This is modelled in ACPI through the INT0002 ACPI device, which is
called a "Virtual GPIO controller" in ACPI because it defines the
event handler to call when the PME triggers through _AEI and _L02
methods as would be done for a real GPIO interrupt in ACPI.

This commit adds a driver which registers the Virtual GPIOs expected
by the DSDT on these devices, letting gpiolib-acpi claim the
virtual GPIO and install a GPIO-interrupt handler which call the _L02
handler as it would for a real GPIO controller.
