arm64: dts: uniphier: add input-delay properties to Cadence eMMC node

Since commit a89c472d8b55 ("mmc: sdhci-cadence: Update PHY delay
configuration"), PHY parameters must be specified by DT.

The hard-coded settings have been converted as follows:
- SDHCI_CDNS_PHY_DLY_SD_DEFAULT -> cdns,phy-input-delay-legacy
- SDHCI_CDNS_PHY_DLY_EMMC_SDR   -> cdns,phy-input-delay-mmc-highspeed
- SDHCI_CDNS_PHY_DLY_EMMC_DDR   -> cdns,phy-input-delay-mmc-ddr

The following have not been moved:
- SDHCI_CDNS_PHY_DLY_SD_HS
   this is unneeded in the eMMC configuration
- SDHCI_CDNS_PHY_DLY_EMMC_LEGACY
   this is never enabled by the driver as it is covered by
   SDHCI_CDNS_PHY_DLY_SD_DEFAULT
