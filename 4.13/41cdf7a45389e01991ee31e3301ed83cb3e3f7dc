crypto: authencesn - Fix digest_null crash

When authencesn is used together with digest_null a crash will
occur on the decrypt path.  This is because normally we perform
a special setup to preserve the ESN, but this is skipped if there
is no authentication.  However, on the post-authentication path
it always expects the preservation to be in place, thus causing
a crash when digest_null is used.

This patch fixes this by also skipping the post-processing when
there is no authentication.
