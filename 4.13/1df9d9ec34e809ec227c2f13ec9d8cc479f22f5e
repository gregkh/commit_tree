usb: musb: tusb6010_omap: Create new struct for DMA data/parameters

For the DMA we have ch (channel), dmareq and sync_dev parameters both
within the tusb_omap_dma_ch and tusb_omap_dma struct.
By creating a common struct the code can be simplified when selecting
between the shared or multichannel DMA parameters.
