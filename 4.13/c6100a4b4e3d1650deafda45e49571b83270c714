Btrfs: replace tree->mapping with tree->private_data

For extent_io tree's we have carried the address_mapping of the inode
around in the io tree in order to pull the inode back out for calling
into various tree ops hooks.  This works fine when everything that has
an extent_io_tree has an inode.  But we are going to remove the
btree_inode, so we need to change this.  Instead just have a generic
void * for private data that we can initialize with, and have all the
tree ops use that instead.  This had a lot of cascading changes but
should be relatively straightforward.
