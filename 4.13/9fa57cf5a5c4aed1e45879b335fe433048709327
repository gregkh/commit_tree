sched/cputime: Always set tsk->vtime_snap_whence after accounting vtime

Even though it doesn't have functional consequences, setting
the task's new context state after we actually accounted the pending
vtime from the old context state makes more sense from a review
perspective.

vtime_user_exit() is the only function that doesn't follow that rule
and that can bug the reviewer for a little while until he realizes there
is no reason for this special case.
