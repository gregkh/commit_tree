rcu: Remove *_SLOW_* Kconfig options

The RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_PREINIT, RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_PREINIT_DELAY,
RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_PREINIT_DELAY, RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_INIT,
RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_INIT_DELAY, RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_CLEANUP,
and RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_CLEANUP_DELAY Kconfig options are only
useful for torture testing, and there are the rcutree.gp_cleanup_delay,
rcutree.gp_init_delay, and rcutree.gp_preinit_delay kernel boot parameters
that rcutorture can use instead.  The effect of these parameters is to
artificially slow down grace period initialization and cleanup in order
to make some types of race conditions happen more often.

This commit therefore simplifies Tree RCU a bit by removing the Kconfig
options and adding the corresponding kernel parameters to rcutorture's
.boot files instead.  However, this commit also leaves out the kernel
parameters for TREE02, TREE04, and TREE07 in order to have about the
same number of tests slowed as not slowed.  TREE01, TREE03, TREE05,
and TREE06 are slowed, and the rest are not slowed.
