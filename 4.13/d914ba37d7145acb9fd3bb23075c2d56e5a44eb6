tracing: Add support for recording tgid of tasks

Inorder to support recording of tgid, the following changes are made:

* Introduce a new API (tracing_record_taskinfo) to additionally record the tgid
  along with the task's comm at the same time. This has has the benefit of not
  setting trace_cmdline_save before all the information for a task is saved.
* Add a new API tracing_record_taskinfo_sched_switch to record task information
  for 2 tasks at a time (previous and next) and use it from sched_switch probe.
* Preserve the old API (tracing_record_cmdline) and create it as a wrapper
  around the new one so that existing callers aren't affected.
* Reuse the existing sched_switch and sched_wakeup probes to record tgid
  information and add a new option 'record-tgid' to enable recording of tgid

When record-tgid option isn't enabled to being with, we take care to make sure
that there's isn't memory or runtime overhead.
