drm/i915/cnp: Add PCI ID for Cannonpoint LP PCH

The first two bytes of PCI ID for CNP_LP PCH are the same as that of
SPT_LP. We should really be looking at the first 9 bits instead of the
first 8 to identify platforms, although this seems to have not caused any
problems on earlier platforms. Introduce a 9 bit extended mask for SPT and
CNP while not touching the code for any of the other platforms.

v2: (Rodrigo) Make platform agnostic and fix commit message.
