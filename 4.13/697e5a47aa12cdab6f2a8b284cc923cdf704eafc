rtc: add generic nvmem support

Many RTCs have an on board non volatile storage. It can be battery backed
RAM or an EEPROM. Use the nvmem subsystem to export it to both userspace
and in-kernel consumers.

This stays compatible with the previous (non documented) ABI that was using
/sys/class/rtc/rtcx/device/nvram to export that memory. But will warn about
the deprecation.
