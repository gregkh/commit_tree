powerpc/mm: Only call store_updates_sp() on stores in do_page_fault()

Function store_updates_sp() checks whether the faulting
instruction is a store updating r1. Therefore we can limit its calls
to store exceptions.

This patch is an improvement of commit a7a9dcd882a67 ("powerpc: Avoid
taking a data miss on every userspace instruction miss")

With the same microbenchmark app, run with 500 as argument, on an
MPC885 we get:

Before this patch: 152000 DTLB misses
After this patch:  147000 DTLB misses
