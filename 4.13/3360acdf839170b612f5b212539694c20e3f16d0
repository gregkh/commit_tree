nvmem: core: fix leaks on registration errors

Make sure to deregister and release the nvmem device and underlying
memory on registration errors.

Note that the private data must be freed using put_device() once the
struct device has been initialised.

Also note that there's a related reference leak in the deregistration
function as reported by Mika Westerberg which is being fixed separately.

Fixes: eace75cfdcf7 ("nvmem: Add a simple NVMEM framework for nvmem providers")
