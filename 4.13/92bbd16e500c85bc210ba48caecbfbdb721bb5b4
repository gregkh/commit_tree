arm64: mmu: Place guard page after mapping of kernel image

The vast majority of virtual allocations in the vmalloc region are followed
by a guard page, which can help to avoid overruning on vma into another,
which may map a read-sensitive device.

This patch adds a guard page to the end of the kernel image mapping (i.e.
following the data/bss segments).
