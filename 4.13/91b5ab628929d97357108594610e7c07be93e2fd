cfg80211: support 4-way handshake offloading for WPA/WPA2-PSK

Let drivers advertise support for station-mode 4-way handshake
offloading with a new NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_4WAY_HANDSHAKE_STA_PSK flag.

Extend use of NL80211_ATTR_PMK attribute indicating it might be passed
as part of NL80211_CMD_CONNECT command, and contain the PSK (which is
the PMK, hence the name.)

The driver/device is assumed to handle the 4-way handshake by
itself in this case (including key derivations, etc.), instead
of relying on the supplicant.

This patch is somewhat based on this one (by Vladimir Kondratiev):
