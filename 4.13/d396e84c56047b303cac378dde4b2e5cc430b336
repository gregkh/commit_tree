mdio_bus: handle only single PHY reset GPIO

Commit 4c5e7a2c0501 ("dt-bindings: mdio: Clarify binding document")
declared that a MDIO reset GPIO property should have only a single GPIO
reference/specifier, however the supporting code was left intact, still
burdening the kernel with now apparently useless loops -- get rid of them.
