xfs: don't crash on unexpected holes in dir/attr btrees

In quite a few places we call xfs_da_read_buf with a mappedbno that we
don't control, then assume that the function passes back either an error
code or a buffer pointer.  Unfortunately, if mappedbno == -2 and bno
maps to a hole, we get a return code of zero and a NULL buffer, which
means that we crash if we actually try to use that buffer pointer.  This
happens immediately when we set the buffer type for transaction context.

Therefore, check that we have no error code and a non-NULL bp before
trying to use bp.  This patch is a follow-up to an incomplete fix in
96a3aefb8ffde231 ("xfs: don't crash if reading a directory results in an
unexpected hole").
