drm/i915: Micro-optimise hotpath through intel_ring_begin()

Typically, there is space available within the ring and if not we have
to wait (by definition a slow path). Rearrange the code to reduce the
number of branches and stack size for the hotpath, accomodating a slight
growth for the wait.

v2: Fix the new assert that packets are not larger than the actual ring.
v3: Make the parameters unsigned as well to make usage.
