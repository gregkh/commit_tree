tcmu: reconfigure netlink attr changes

1. TCMU_ATTR_TYPE is too generic when it describes only the
reconfiguration type, so rename to TCMU_ATTR_RECONFIG_TYPE.

2. Only return the reconfig type when it is a
TCMU_CMD_RECONFIG_DEVICE command.

3. CONFIG_* type is not needed. We can pass the value along with an
ATTR to userspace, so it does not need to read sysfs/configfs.

4. Fix leak in tcmu_dev_path_store and rename to dev_config to
reflect it is more than just a path that can be changed.

6. Don't update kernel struct value if netlink sending fails.
