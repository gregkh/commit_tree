arm64: allwinner: h5: enable dwmac-sun8i for Orange Pi Prime

Add the required DT parts to enable Ethernet (dwmac-sun8i driver) on
the Orange Pi Prime board. It uses an external Realtek RTL8211E PHY
connected via RGMII to provide GbE network.

This includes the regulator (which is controlled by a GPIO pin) and
the actual Ethernet MAC node, referring the RGMII pins of the device.
