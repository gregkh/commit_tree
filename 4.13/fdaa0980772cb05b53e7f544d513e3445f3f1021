ACPICA: ACPI 6.2: Add support for PinGroup() resource

ACPICA commit 7d928e3174fb19d7dc0066b03c30bea07c001563

ACPI 6.2 introduced a new resource that is used to declare set of pins
belonging to a GPIO controller. This resource is referenced by new
PinGroupFunction() and PinGroupConfig() resources using ResourceSource
and ResourceLabel fields.

The PinGroup() resource looks like this:

  PinGroup (ResourceLabel, ResourceUsage, DescriptorName,
            VendorData) {Pin List}

This resource should be listed in _CRS under the GPIO/pincontroller
device providing these pins.
