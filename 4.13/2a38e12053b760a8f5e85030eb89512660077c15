[SMB3] Remove ifdef since SMB3 (and later) now STRONGLY preferred

Remove the CONFIG_CIFS_SMB2 ifdef and Kconfig option since they
must always be on now.

For various security reasons, SMB3 and later are STRONGLY preferred
over CIFS and older dialects, and SMB3 (and later) will now be
the default dialects so we do not want to allow them to be
ifdeffed out.

In the longer term, we may be able to make older CIFS support
disableable in Kconfig with a new set of #ifdef, but we always
want SMB3 and later support enabled.
