xillybus.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:
- Adjust indentation;
- Mark authorship;
- Comment internal contents table;
- Mark literal blocks;
- Don't use all-upercase titles.
