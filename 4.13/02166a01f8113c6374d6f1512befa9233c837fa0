mmc: block: Tag DRV_OPs with a driver operation type

We will expand the DRV_OP usage, so we need to know which
operation we're performing. Tag the operations with an
enum:ed type and rename the function so it is clear that
it deals with any command and put a switch statement in
it. Currently only ioctls are supported.
