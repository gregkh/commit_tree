kref.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- add a title for the document and section titles;
- move authorship information to the beginning and use
  :Author:
- mark literal blocks as such and ident them if needed.
