gpu: host1x: Initialize firewall class to the job's one

The commands stream is prepended by the jobs class on the CDMA
submission, so that explicitly setting a module class in the commands
stream isn't necessary. The firewall initializes its class to 0 and the
command stream that doesn't explicitly specify the class effectively
bypasses the firewall.
