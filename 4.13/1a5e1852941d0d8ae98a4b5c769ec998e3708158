KVM: SVM: suppress unnecessary NMI singlestep on GIF=0 and nested exit

enable_nmi_window is supposed to be a no-op if we know that we'll see
a VM exit by the time the NMI window opens. This commit adds two more
cases:

* We intercept stgi so we don't need to singlestep on GIF=0.

* We emulate nested vmexit so we don't need to singlestep when nested
  VM exit is required.
