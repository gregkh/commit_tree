mm: drop NULL return check of pte_offset_map_lock()

pte_offset_map_lock() finds and takes ptl, and returns pte.  But some
callers return without unlocking the ptl when pte == NULL, which seems
weird.

Git history said that !pte check in change_pte_range() was introduced in
commit 1ad9f620c3a2 ("mm: numa: recheck for transhuge pages under lock
during protection changes") and still remains after commit 175ad4f1e7a2
("mm: mprotect: use pmd_trans_unstable instead of taking the pmd_lock")
which partially reverts 1ad9f620c3a2.  So I think that it's just dead
code.

Many other caller of pte_offset_map_lock() never check NULL return, so
let's do likewise.
