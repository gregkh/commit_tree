clk: bcm2835: Limit PCM clock to OSC and PLLD_PER

Restrict clock sources for the PCM peripheral to the oscillator and
PLLD_PER because other source may have varying rates or be switched off.
Prevent other sources from being selected by replacing their names in
the list of potential parents with dummy entries (entry index is
significant).
