net: check dev->addr_len for dev_set_mac_address()

Historically, dev_ifsioc() uses struct sockaddr as mac
address definition, this is why dev_set_mac_address()
accepts a struct sockaddr pointer as input but now we
have various types of mac addresse whose lengths
are up to MAX_ADDR_LEN, longer than struct sockaddr,
and saved in dev->addr_len.

It is too late to fix dev_ifsioc() due to API
compatibility, so just reject those larger than
sizeof(struct sockaddr), otherwise we would read
and use some random bytes from kernel stack.

Fortunately, only a few IPv6 tunnel devices have addr_len
larger than sizeof(struct sockaddr) and they don't support
ndo_set_mac_addr(). But with team driver, in lb mode, they
can still be enslaved to a team master and make its mac addr
length as the same.
