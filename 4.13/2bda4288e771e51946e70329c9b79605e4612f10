ASoC: nau8825: make crosstalk function optional

Make crosstalk functoin optional.
The jack detection can speed up without crosstalk detection.
Let the decision of function usage to platform design.

The patch helps the issue concern as follows:
Google issue 35574278: Chell_headphone pop back from S3

There is a concern as follows:
cras getting blocked for 2 seconds (worst-case 3 seconds)
As I understand, ChromeOS expects resume finishes in 1 seconds.
Video/Audio playing after 3 seconds of resume seems against the spec.
If we really have to make the choice I would choose pop noise instead
of waiting for 3 seconds.
