ALSA: pcm/oss: refer to parameters instead of copying to reduce usage of kernel stack

Some functions in compatibility layer for Open Sound System interface has
local variable to copy some parameters in runtime of PCM substream, while
this can be replaced with reference of pointers to parameter itself. This
brings an advantage to reduce usage of kernel stack.

This commit applies this idea.
