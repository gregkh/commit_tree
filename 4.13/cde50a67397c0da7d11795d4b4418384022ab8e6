locking/rtmutex: Don't initialize lockdep when not required

pi_mutex isn't supposed to be tracked by lockdep, but just
passing NULLs for name and key will cause lockdep to spew a
warning and die, which is not what we want it to do.

Skip lockdep initialization if the caller passed NULLs for
name and key, suggesting such initialization isn't desired.
