ALSA: core: Fix unexpected error at replacing user TLV

When user tries to replace the user-defined control TLV, the kernel
checks the change of its content via memcmp().  The problem is that
the kernel passes the return value from memcmp() as is.  memcmp()
gives a non-zero negative value depending on the comparison result,
and this shall be recognized as an error code.

The patch covers that corner-case, return 1 properly for the changed
TLV.
