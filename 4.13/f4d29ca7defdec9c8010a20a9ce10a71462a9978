sparc64: Enhance search for VIO device in MDESC

Enhances search for VIO device in MDESC by leveraging already existing
MDESC APIs. Enhances changes in earlier patch,
"sparc: Machine description indices can vary", by using existing MD
search functions. It also specifies a match function, thereby
enabling device_find_child() to use it for the purpose of matching
device nodes in MDESC.

An API to find VDEV node in MDESC based on its md_node_info is also
added. It is planned to be used by VIO device clients in the future.
