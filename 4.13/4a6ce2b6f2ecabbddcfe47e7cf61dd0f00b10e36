net: introduce a new function dst_dev_put()

This function should be called when removing routes from fib tree after
the dst gc is no longer in use.
We first mark DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD on this dst to make sure next
dst_ops->check() fails and returns NULL.
Secondly, as we no longer keep the gc_list, we need to properly
release dst->dev right at the moment when the dst is removed from
the fib/fib6 tree.
It does the following:
1. change dst->input and output pointers to dst_discard/dst_dscard_out to
   discard all packets
2. replace dst->dev with loopback interface
