drm/i915: Check for allocation failure

The memory allocation for C is not being null checked and hence we
could end up with a null pointer dereference. Fix this with a null
pointer check. (I really should have noticed this when I was fixing an
earlier issue.)

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1436406 ("Dereference null return")
