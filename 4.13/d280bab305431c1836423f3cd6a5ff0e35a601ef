block: Introduce request_queue.initialize_rq_fn()

Several block drivers need to initialize the driver-private request
data after having called blk_get_request() and before .prep_rq_fn()
is called, e.g. when submitting a REQ_OP_SCSI_* request. Avoid that
that initialization code has to be repeated after every
blk_get_request() call by adding new callback functions to struct
request_queue and to struct blk_mq_ops.
