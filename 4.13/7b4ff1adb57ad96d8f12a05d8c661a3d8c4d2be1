mutex, futex: adjust kernel-doc markups to generate ReST

There are a few issues on some kernel-doc markups that was
causing troubles with kernel-doc output on ReST format:

./kernel/futex.c:492: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
./kernel/futex.c:1264: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
./kernel/futex.c:1721: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
./kernel/futex.c:2338: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
./kernel/futex.c:2426: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
./kernel/futex.c:2899: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
./kernel/futex.c:2972: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Fix them.
