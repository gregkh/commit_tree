drm/i915/selftests: Silence compiler warning in igt_ctx_exec

The compiler doesn't always spot the guard that object is allocated on
the first pass, leading to:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/selftests/i915_gem_context.c: warning: 'obj' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]:  => 370:8

v2: Make it more obvious by setting obj to NULL on the first pass and
any later pass where we need to reallocate.
