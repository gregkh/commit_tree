xen-swiotlb: consolidate xen_swiotlb_dma_ops

ARM and x86 had duplicated versions of the dma_ops structure, the
only difference is that x86 hasn't wired up the set_dma_mask,
mmap, and get_sgtable ops yet.  On x86 all of them are identical
to the generic version, so they aren't needed but harmless.

All the symbols used only for xen_swiotlb_dma_ops can now be marked
static as well.
