ipv6: dad: don't remove dynamic addresses if link is down

Currently, when the link for $DEV is down, this command succeeds but the
address is removed immediately by DAD (1):

    ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid_lft 3600 preferred_lft 1800

In the same situation, this will succeed and not remove the address (2):

    ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV
    ip addr change 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid_lft 3600 preferred_lft 1800

The comment in addrconf_dad_begin() when !IF_READY makes it look like
this is the intended behavior, but doesn't explain why:

     * If the device is not ready:
     * - keep it tentative if it is a permanent address.
     * - otherwise, kill it.

We clearly cannot prevent userspace from doing (2), but we can make (1)
work consistently with (2).

addrconf_dad_stop() is only called in two cases: if DAD failed, or to
skip DAD when the link is down. In that second case, the fix is to avoid
deleting the address, like we already do for permanent addresses.
