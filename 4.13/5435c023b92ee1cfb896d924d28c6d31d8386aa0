blk-mq: Warn when attempting to run a hardware queue that is not mapped

A queue must be frozen while the mapped state of a hardware queue
is changed. Additionally, any change of the mapped state is
followed by a call to blk_mq_map_swqueue() (see also
blk_mq_init_allocated_queue() and blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues()).
Since blk_mq_map_swqueue() does not map any unmapped hardware
queue onto any software queue, no attempt will be made to run
an unmapped hardware queue. Hence issue a warning upon attempts
to run an unmapped hardware queue.
