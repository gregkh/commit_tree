qed: Don't inherit RoCE DCBx for V2

Older firmware used by device didn't distinguish between RoCE and RoCE
V2 from DCBx configuration perspective, and as a result we've used to
take a the RoCE-related configuration and apply to it for both.

Since we now support configuring each its own values, there's no reason
to reflect [& configure] that both are using the same.
