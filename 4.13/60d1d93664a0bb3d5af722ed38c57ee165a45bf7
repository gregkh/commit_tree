tipc: reassign pointers after skb reallocation / linearization

In tipc_msg_reverse(), we assign skb attributes to local pointers
in stack at startup. This is followed by skb_linearize() and for
cloned buffers we perform skb relocation using pskb_expand_head().
Both these methods may update the skb attributes and thus making
the pointers incorrect.

In this commit, we fix this error by ensuring that the pointers
are re-assigned after any of these skb operations.

when needed")
