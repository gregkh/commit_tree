libceph: don't call ->reencode_message() more than once per message

Reencoding an already reencoded message is a bad idea.  This could
happen on Policy::stateful_server connections (!CEPH_MSG_CONNECT_LOSSY),
such as MDS sessions.

This didn't pop up in testing because currently only OSD requests are
reencoded and OSD sessions are always lossy.
