mm: avoid taking zone lock in pagetypeinfo_showmixed()

pagetypeinfo_showmixedcount_print is found to take a lot of time to
complete and it does this holding the zone lock and disabling
interrupts.  In some cases it is found to take more than a second (On a
2.4GHz,8Gb RAM,arm64 cpu).

Avoid taking the zone lock similar to what is done by read_page_owner,
which means possibility of inaccurate results.
