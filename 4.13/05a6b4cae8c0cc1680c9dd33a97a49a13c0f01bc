liquidio: fix bug in soft reset failure detection

The code that detects a failed soft reset of Octeon is comparing the wrong
value against the reset value of the Octeon SLI_SCRATCH_1 register,
resulting in an inability to detect a soft reset failure.  Fix it by using
the correct value in the comparison, which is any non-zero value.
