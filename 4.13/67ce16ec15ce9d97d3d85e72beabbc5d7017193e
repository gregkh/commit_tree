arm64: mm: print out correct page table entries

When we take a fault that can't be handled, we print out the page table
entries associated with the faulting address. In some cases we currently
print out the wrong entries. For a faulting TTBR1 address, we sometimes
print out TTBR0 table entries instead, and for a faulting TTBR0 address
we sometimes print out TTBR1 table entries. Fix this by choosing the
tables based on the faulting address.
