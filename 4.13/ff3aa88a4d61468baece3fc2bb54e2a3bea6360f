iio: adc: ina219: Avoid underflow for sleeping time

Proper support for the INA219 lowered the minimum sampling period from
2*140us to 2*84us. Subtracting 200us later leads to an underflow and
an almost infinite udelay later.

Using a signed int for the sampling period provides sufficient range
(at most 2*8640*1024us), but catches the underflow when comparing with
buffer_us.
