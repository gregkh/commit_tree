rcu: Remove the now-obsolete PROVE_RCU_REPEATEDLY Kconfig option

The PROVE_RCU_REPEATEDLY Kconfig option was initially added due to
the volume of messages from PROVE_RCU: Doing just one per boot would
have required excessive numbers of boots to locate them all.  However,
PROVE_RCU messages are now relatively rare, so there is no longer any
reason to need more than one such message per boot.  This commit therefore
removes the PROVE_RCU_REPEATEDLY Kconfig option.
