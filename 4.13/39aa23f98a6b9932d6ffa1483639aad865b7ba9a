scsi: lpfc: make a couple of functions static

functions lpfc_nvmet_cleanup_io_context and lpfc_nvmet_setup_io_context
can be made static as they do not need to be in global scope.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
  "warning: symbol 'lpfc_nvmet_cleanup_io_context' was not declared.
   Should it be static?"
  "warning: symbol 'lpfc_nvmet_setup_io_context' was not declared.
   Should it be static?"
