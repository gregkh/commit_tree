IB/core: Don't resolve IP address to the loopback device

When resolving an IP address that is on the host of the caller the
result from querying the routing table is the loopback device. This is
not a valid response, because it doesn't represent the RDMA device and
the port.

Therefore, callers need to check the resolved device and if it is a
loopback device find an alternative way to resolve it. To avoid this we
make sure that the response from rdma_resolve_ip() will not be the
loopback device.

While that, we fix an static checker warning about dereferencing an
unintitialized pointer using the same solution as in commit abeffce90c7f
("net/mlx5e: Fix a -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning") as a reference.
