arm64: allwinner: a64: Convert CCU raw number references to macros

The A64 device tree file has some remnants of raw number references
to the CCU node, likely from when the CCU bindings and device tree
changes were first merged.

Convert these, and the R_CCU ones, to use the proper defined macros
from their respective device tree binding header files.
