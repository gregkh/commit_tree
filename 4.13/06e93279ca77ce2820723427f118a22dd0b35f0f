tpm: move endianness conversion of TPM_TAG_RQU_COMMAND to tpm_input_header

In the long term, TPM 1.2 functions in the driver interface will be
modified to use tpm_buf_init().

However, tag and ordinals cannot be passed directly to tpm_buf_init(),
because this function performs CPU native to big-endian conversion of these
arguments. Since TPM_TAG_RQU_COMMAND and TPM_ORD_ are already converted,
passing them to the function will undo the previous conversion.

This patch moves the conversion of TPM_TAG_RQU_COMMAND from the tpm.h
header file in the driver directory to the tpm_input_header declarations
in the driver interface and tpm-sysfs.c.
