ARM: sun8i: h3: bananapi-m2-plus: Enable USB OTG

The Bananapi M2 Plus has a USB OTG port that can be used in both
powered host mode and peripheral mode. When in peripheral mode,
the port does not power the board. There is no VBUS sensing on
the port.

This patch adds the regulator controlling VBUS on the OTG port,
the GPIO for the ID detect pin, and enables the USB OTG and host
controllers.
