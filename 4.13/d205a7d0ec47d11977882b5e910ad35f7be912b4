xfs: refactor dir2 leaf readahead shadow buffer cleverness

Currently, the dir2 leaf block getdents function uses a complex state
tracking mechanism to create a shadow copy of the block mappings and
then uses the shadow copy to schedule readahead.  Since the read and
readahead functions are perfectly capable of reading the mappings
themselves, we can tear all that out in favor of a simpler function that
simply keeps pushing the readahead window further out.
