uuid,afs: move struct uuid_v1 back into afs

This essentially is a partial revert of commit ff548773
("afs: Move UUID struct to linux/uuid.h") and moves struct uuid_v1 back into
fs/afs as struct afs_uuid.  It however keeps it as big endian structure
so that we can use the normal uuid generation helpers when casting to/from
struct afs_uuid.

The V1 uuid intrepretation in struct form isn't really useful to the
rest of the kernel, and not really compatible to it either, so move it
back to AFS instead of polluting the global uuid.h.
