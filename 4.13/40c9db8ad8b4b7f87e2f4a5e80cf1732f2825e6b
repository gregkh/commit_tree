ibmvnic: Client-initiated failover

The IBM vNIC protocol provides support for the user to initiate
a failover from the client LPAR in case the current backing infrastructure
is deemed inadequate or in an error state.

Support for two H_VIOCTL sub-commands for vNIC devices are required
to implement this function. These commands are H_GET_SESSION_TOKEN
and H_SESSION_ERR_DETECTED.

"[H_GET_SESSION_TOKEN] is used to obtain a session token from a VNIC client
adapter.  This token is opaque to the caller and is intended to be used in
tandem with the SESSION_ERROR_DETECTED vioctl subfunction."

"[H_SESSION_ERR_DETECTED] is used to report that the currently active
backing device for a VNIC client adapter is behaving poorly, and that
the hypervisor should attempt to fail over to a different backing device,
if one is available."

To provide tools access to this functionality the vNIC driver creates a
sysfs file that, when written to, will send a request to pHyp to failover
to a different backing device.
