audit: make sure we never skip the multicast broadcast

When the auditd connection is reset, either intentionally or due to
a failure, any records that were in the main backlog queue would not
be sent in a multicast broadcast.  This patch fixes this problem by
not flushing the main backlog queue on a connection reset, the main
kauditd_thread() will take care of that normally.
