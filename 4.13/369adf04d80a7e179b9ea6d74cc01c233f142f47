time: Add warning about imminent deprecation of CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME_VSYSCALL_OLD

CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME_VSYSCALL_OLD was introduced five years ago
to allow a transition from the old vsyscall implementations to
the new method (which simplified internal accounting and made
timekeeping more precise).

However, PPC and IA64 have yet to make the transition, despite
in some cases me sending test patches to try to help it along.

http://patches.linaro.org/patch/30501/
http://patches.linaro.org/patch/35412/

If its helpful, my last pass at the patches can be found here:
https://git.linaro.org/people/john.stultz/linux.git dev/oldvsyscall-cleanup

So I think its time to set a deadline and make it clear this
is going away. So this patch adds warnings about this
functionality being dropped. Likely to be in v4.15.
