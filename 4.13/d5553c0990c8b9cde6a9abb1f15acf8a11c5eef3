drm/i915: Move the unclaimed mmio detection into the powerwell for KMS

Replace the large comment about requiring the powerwell for
intel_uncore_arm_unclaimed_mmio_detection() by moving the arming of the
mmio error detection into the powerwell held for modesetting. Thereby
also accomplishing the goal of only arming the mmio detection after a
full modeset.
