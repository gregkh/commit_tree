lightnvm: pblk: set mempool and workqueue params.

Make constants to define sizes for internal mempools and workqueues. In
this process, adjust the values to be more meaningful given the internal
constrains of the FTL. In order to do this for workqueues, separate the
current auxiliary workqueue into two dedicated workqueues to manage
lines being closed and bad blocks.
