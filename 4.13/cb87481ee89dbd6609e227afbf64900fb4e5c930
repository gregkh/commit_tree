kbuild: linker script do not match C names unless LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION is configured

The .data and .bss sections were modified in the generic linker script to
pull in sections named .data.<C identifier>, which are generated by gcc with
-ffunction-sections and -fdata-sections options.

The problem with this pattern is it can also match section names that Linux
defines explicitly, e.g., .data.unlikely. This can cause Linux sections to
get moved into the wrong place.

The way to avoid this is to use ".." separators for explicit section names
(the dot character is valid in a section name but not a C identifier).
However currently there are sections which don't follow this rule, so for
now just disable the wild card by default.
