objtool, x86: Add several functions and files to the objtool whitelist

In preparation for an objtool rewrite which will have broader checks,
whitelist functions and files which cause problems because they do
unusual things with the stack.

These whitelists serve as a TODO list for which functions and files
don't yet have undwarf unwinder coverage.  Eventually most of the
whitelists can be removed in favor of manual CFI hint annotations or
objtool improvements.
