pids: make task_tgid_nr_ns() safe

This was reported many times, and this was even mentioned in commit
52ee2dfdd4f5 ("pids: refactor vnr/nr_ns helpers to make them safe") but
somehow nobody bothered to fix the obvious problem: task_tgid_nr_ns() is
not safe because task->group_leader points to nowhere after the exiting
task passes exit_notify(), rcu_read_lock() can not help.

We really need to change __unhash_process() to nullify group_leader,
parent, and real_parent, but this needs some cleanups.  Until then we
can turn task_tgid_nr_ns() into another user of __task_pid_nr_ns() and
fix the problem.
