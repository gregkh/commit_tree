dell_rbu.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx.

Currently, the document is completely unformatted. Add
titles, do indentation, mark literal blocks.
