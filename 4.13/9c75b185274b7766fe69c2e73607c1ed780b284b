drm/i915: reintroduce VLV/CHV PFI programming power domain workaround

There are still cases on these platforms where an attempt is made to
configure the CDCLK while the power domain is off, like when coming back
from a suspend.  So the workaround below is still needed.

This effectively reverts commit 63ff30442519 ("drm/i915: Nuke the
VLV/CHV PFI programming power domain workaround").
