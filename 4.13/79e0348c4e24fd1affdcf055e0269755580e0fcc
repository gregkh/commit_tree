mtd: nand: check ecc->total sanity in nand_scan_tail

Drivers are supposed to set correct ecc->{size,strength,bytes} before
calling nand_scan_tail(), but it does not complain about ecc->total
bigger than oobsize.

In this case, chip->scan_bbt() crashes due to memory corruption, but
it is hard to debug.  It would be kind to fail it earlier with a clear
message.
