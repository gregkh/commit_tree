scsi: cxlflash: Introduce host ioctl support

As staging for supporting various host management functions, add a host
ioctl infrastructure to filter ioctl commands and perform operations that
are common for all host ioctls. Also update the cxlflash documentation to
create a new section for documenting host ioctls.
