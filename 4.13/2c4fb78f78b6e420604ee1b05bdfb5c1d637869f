KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Workaround POWER9 DD1.0 bug causing IPB bit loss

This adds a workaround for a bug in POWER9 DD1 chips where changing
the CPPR (Current Processor Priority Register) can cause bits in the
IPB (Interrupt Pending Buffer) to get lost.  Thankfully it only
happens when manually manipulating CPPR which is quite rare.  When it
does happen it can cause interrupts to be delayed or lost.
