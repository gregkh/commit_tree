drm/amdgpu: add limitation for dedicated vm number v4

Limit reserved vmids to 1 to avoid taking too many
out of commission and starving the system.

v2: move #define to amdgpu_vm.h
v3: move reserved vmid counter to id_manager,
and increase counter before allocating vmid
v4: rename to reserved_vmid_num
