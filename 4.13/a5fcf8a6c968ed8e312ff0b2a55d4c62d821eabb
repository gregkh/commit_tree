net: propagate tc filter chain index down the ndo_setup_tc call

We need to push the chain index down to the drivers, so they have the
information to which chain the rule belongs. For now, no driver supports
multichain offload, so only chain 0 is supported. This is needed to
prevent chain squashes during offload for now. Later this will be used
to implement multichain offload.
