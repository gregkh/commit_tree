sched/wait: Rename wait_queue_t => wait_queue_entry_t

Rename:

	wait_queue_t		=>	wait_queue_entry_t

'wait_queue_t' was always a slight misnomer: its name implies that it's a "queue",
but in reality it's a queue *entry*. The 'real' queue is the wait queue head,
which had to carry the name.

Start sorting this out by renaming it to 'wait_queue_entry_t'.

This also allows the real structure name 'struct __wait_queue' to
lose its double underscore and become 'struct wait_queue_entry',
which is the more canonical nomenclature for such data types.
