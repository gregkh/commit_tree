bpf: Remove duplicate tcp_filter hook in ipv6

There are two tcp_filter hooks in tcp_ipv6 ingress path currently.
One is at tcp_v6_rcv and another is in tcp_v6_do_rcv. It seems the
tcp_filter() call inside tcp_v6_do_rcv is redundent and some packet
will be filtered twice in this situation. This will cause trouble
when using eBPF filters to account traffic data.
