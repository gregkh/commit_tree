mm/zsmalloc: simplify zs_max_alloc_size handling

Commit 40f9fb8cffc6 ("mm/zsmalloc: support allocating obj with size of
ZS_MAX_ALLOC_SIZE") fixes a size calculation error that prevented
zsmalloc to allocate an object of the maximal size (ZS_MAX_ALLOC_SIZE).
I think however the fix is unneededly complicated.

This patch replaces the dynamic calculation of zs_size_classes at init
time by a compile time calculation that uses the DIV_ROUND_UP() macro
already used in get_size_class_index().
