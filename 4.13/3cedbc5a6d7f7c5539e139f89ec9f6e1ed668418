intel_pstate: use updated msr-index.h HWP.EPP values

intel_pstate exports sysfs attributes for setting and observing HWP.EPP.
These attributes use strings to describe 4 operating states, and
inside the driver, these strings are mapped to numerical register
values.

The authorative mapping between the strings and numerical HWP.EPP values
are now globally defined in msr-index.h, replacing the out-dated
mapping that were open-coded into intel_pstate.c

new old string
--- --- ------
  0   0 performance
128  64 balance_performance
192 128 balance_power
255 192 power

Note that the HW and BIOS default value on most system is 128,
which intel_pstate will now call "balance_performance"
while it used to call it "balance_power".
