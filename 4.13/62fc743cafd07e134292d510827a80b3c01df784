platform/x86: acer-wmi: Using zero as first WMI instance number

Pali Rohár found that there have some wmi query/evaluation
code that they used 'one' as the first WMI instance number.
But the number is indexed from zero that it's must less than
the instance_count in _WDG.

This patch changes those instance number from one to zero.
