SPARC64: Fix sun4v DMA panic

64bit DMA only supported on sun4v equipped with ATU IOMMU HW.
'Commit b02c2b0bfd7ae ("sparc: remove arch specific dma_supported
implementations")' introduced a code that incorrectly allow
dma_supported() to succeed for 64bit dma mask even if system doesn't
have ATU IOMMU. This results into panic.

Fix it.
