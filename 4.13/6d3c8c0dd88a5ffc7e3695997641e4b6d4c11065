net: dsa: Remove master_netdev and use dst->cpu_dp->netdev

In preparation for supporting multiple CPU ports, remove
dst->master_netdev and ds->master_netdev and replace them with only one
instance of the common object we have for a port: struct
dsa_port::netdev. ds->master_netdev is currently write only and would be
helpful in the case where we have two switches, both with CPU ports, and
also connected within each other, which the multi-CPU port patch series
would address.

While at it, introduce a helper function used in net/dsa/slave.c to
immediately get a reference on the master network device called
dsa_master_netdev().
