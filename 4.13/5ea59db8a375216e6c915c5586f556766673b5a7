brcmfmac: Fix glom_skb leak in brcmf_sdiod_recv_chain

An earlier change to this function (3bdae810721b) fixed a leak in the
case of an unsuccessful call to brcmf_sdiod_buffrw(). However, the
glom_skb buffer, used for emulating a scattering read, is never used
or referenced after its contents are copied into the destination
buffers, and therefore always needs to be freed by the end of the
function.
