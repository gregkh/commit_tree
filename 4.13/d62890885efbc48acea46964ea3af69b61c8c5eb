batman-adv: Accept only filled wifi station info

The wifi driver can decide to not provide parts of the station info. For
example, the expected throughput of the station can be omitted when the
used rate control doesn't provide this kind of information.

The B.A.T.M.A.N. V implementation must therefore check the filled bitfield
before it tries to access the expected_throughput of the returned
station_info.
