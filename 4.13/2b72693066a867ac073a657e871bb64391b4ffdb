ACPICA: ACPI 6.2: Add support for PinFunction() resource

ACPICA commit 6bbc6357f7061f1243601adde0ea45f7a89274e0

ACPI 6.2 introduced a new resource that is used to describe how certain
pins are muxed for a device. The ASL syntax of this new resource looks
like below:

  PinFunction(Shared, PinConfig, FunctionNumber, ResourceSource,
              ResourceSourceIndex, ResourceUsage, DescriptorName,
              VendorData) {Pin List}

Which is pretty similar to GpioIo()/GpioInt() resources.

Teach ACPICA about this new resource.
