ALSA: pcm: add a helper function to apply parameter rules

Application of rules to parameters of PCM substream is done in a call of
snd_pcm_hw_refine(), while the function includes much codes and is not
enough friendly to readers.

This commit splits the codes to a separated function so that readers can
get it easily. I leave desicion into compilers to merge the function into
its callee.
