ACPI / PM: Run wakeup notify handlers synchronously

The work functions provided by the users of acpi_add_pm_notifier()
should be run synchronously before re-enabling the wakeup GPE in
case they are used to clear the status and/or disable the wakeup
signaling at the source.  Otherwise, which is the case currently in
the PCI bus type code, the same wakeup event may be signaled for
multiple times while the execution of the work function in response
to it has already been queued up.

Fortunately, acpi_add_pm_notifier() is only used by PCI and by
ACPI device PM code internally, so the change is relatively
straightforward to make.
