iwlwifi: pcie: don't report RF-kill enabled while shutting down

When toggling the RF-kill pin quickly in succession, the driver can
get rather confused because it might be in the process of shutting
down, expecting all commands to go through quickly due to rfkill,
but the transport already thinks the device is accessible again,
even though it previously shut it down. This leads to bugs, and I
even observed a kernel panic.

Avoid this by making the PCIe code only report that the radio is
enabled again after the higher layers actually decided to shut it
off.

This also pulls out this common RF-kill checking code into a common
function called by both transport generations and also moves it to
the direct method - in the internal helper we don't really care
about the RF-kill status anymore since we won't report it up until
the stop anyway.
