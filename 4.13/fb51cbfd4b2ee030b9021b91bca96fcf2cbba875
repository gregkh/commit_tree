drm/arcgpu: Drop drm_vblank_cleanup

CRTC don't seem to get shut down in a controlled fashion, but no one
bothers to stop interrupts either so this races no matter what. Might
as well remove it. A call to drm_atomic_helper_shutdown would be
pretty sweet somewhere (and maybe getting rid of the load/unload
callbacks while at it).
