scsi: qla2xxx: Add FC-NVMe port discovery and PRLI handling

Added logic to change the login process into an optional PRIL step for
FC-NVMe ports as a separate operation, such that we can change type to
0x28 (NVMe).

Currently, the driver performs the PLOGI/PRLI together as one operation,
but if the discovered port is an NVMe port then we first issue the PLOGI
and then we issue the PRLI. Also, the fabric discovery logic was changed
to mark each discovered FC NVMe port, so that we can register them with
the FC-NVMe transport later.
