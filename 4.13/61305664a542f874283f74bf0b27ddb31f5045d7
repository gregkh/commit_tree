iio: hi8435: cleanup reset gpio

Reset GPIO is active low.

Currently driver uses gpiod_set_value(1) to clean reset, which depends
on device tree to contain GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH - that does not match reality.

This fixes driver to use _raw version of gpiod_set_value() to enforce
active-low semantics despite of what's written in device tree. Allowing
device tree to override that only opens possibility for errors and does
not add any value.

Additionally, use _cansleep version to make things work with i2c-gpio
and other sleeping gpio drivers.
