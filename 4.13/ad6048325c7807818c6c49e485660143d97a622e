scsi: hisi_sas: define hisi_sas_device.device_id as int

Currently hisi_sas_device.device_id is a u64. This can create a problem
in selecting the queue for a device, in that this code does a 64b
division on device id. For some 32b systems, 64b division is slow and
the lib reference must be explicitly included.

The device id does not need to be 64b in size, so, as a solution, just
make as an int.

Also, struct hisi_sas_device elements are re-ordered to improve packing
efficiency.
