net: phy: Relax error checking on sysfs_create_link()

Some Ethernet drivers will attach/connect to a PHY device before calling
register_netdevice() which is responsible for calling netdev_register_kobject()
which would do the network device's kobject initialization. In such a case,
sysfs_create_link() would return -ENOENT because the network device's kobject
is not ready yet, and we would fail to connect to the PHY device.

In order to keep things simple and symetrical, we just take the success path as
indicative of the ability to access the network device's kobject, and create
the second link if that's the case.
