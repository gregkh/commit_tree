xen/blkfront: always allocate grants first from per-queue persistent grants

This patch partially reverts 3df0e50 ("xen/blkfront: pseudo support for
multi hardware queues/rings"). The xen-blkfront queue/ring might hang due
to grants allocation failure in the situation when gnttab_free_head is
almost empty while many persistent grants are reserved for this queue/ring.

As persistent grants management was per-queue since 73716df ("xen/blkfront:
make persistent grants pool per-queue"), we should always allocate from
persistent grants first.
