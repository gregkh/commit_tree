srcu: Use rnp->lock wrappers to replace explicit memory barriers

This commit uses TREE RCU's rnp->lock wrappers to replace a few explicit
memory barriers.  This change also has the advantage of making SRCU's
memory-ordering properties be implemented in roughly the same way as they
are in Tree RCU.
