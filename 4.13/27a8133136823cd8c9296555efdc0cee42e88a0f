ARM: dts: OMAP5: uevm: add µSD card detect

If we have Linux installed in eMMC we can boot without
µSD card, but inserting one is not recognised.

The reason is that the card detect gpio (gpio5_152)
is not configured and attached to the mmc1 interface
driver and the mmc driver does not poll by default.

Hence we add pinmux and gpio setup for the SDCARD_NCD
signal.
