block: disable runtime-pm for blk-mq

The blk-mq code lacks support for looking at the rpm_status field, tracking
active requests and the RQF_PM flag.

Due to the default switch to blk-mq for scsi people start to run into
suspend / resume issue due to this fact, so make sure we disable the runtime
PM functionality until it is properly implemented.
