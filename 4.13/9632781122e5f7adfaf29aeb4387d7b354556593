phy: rockchip-inno-usb2: add one phy comprises with two host-ports support

At the current rockchip-inno-usb2 phy driver framework, it can
only support usb2-phy which comprises with one otg-port and one
host-port.

However, some Rockchip SoCs' (e.g RK3228, RK3229) usb2-phy comprises
with two host-ports, so we use index of otg id for one host-port
configuration, and make it work the same as otg-port host mode.
