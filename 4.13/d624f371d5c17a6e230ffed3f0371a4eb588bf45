lightnvm: pblk: generalize erase path

Erase I/Os are scheduled with the following goals in mind: (i) minimize
LUNs collisions with write I/Os, and (ii) even out the price of erasing
on every write, instead of putting all the burden on when garbage
collection runs. This works well on the current design, but is specific
to the default mapping algorithm.

This patch generalizes the erase path so that other mapping algorithms
can select an arbitrary line to be erased instead. It also gets rid of
the erase semaphore since it creates jittering for user writes.
