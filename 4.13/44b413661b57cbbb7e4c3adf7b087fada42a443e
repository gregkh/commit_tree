hwmon: (aspeed-pwm-tacho) Poll with short sleeps.

The reference driver polled but mentioned it was possible to sleep
for a computed period to know when it's ready to read.  However, polling
with minimal sleeps is quick and works.  This also improves responsiveness
from the driver.

Testing: tested on ast2400 on quanta-q71l
