perf/x86: Add sysfs entry to freeze counters on SMI

Currently, the SMIs are visible to all performance counters, because
many users want to measure everything including SMIs. But in some
cases, the SMI cycles should not be counted - for example, to calculate
the cost of an SMI itself. So a knob is needed.

When setting FREEZE_WHILE_SMM bit in IA32_DEBUGCTL, all performance
counters will be effected. There is no way to do per-counter freeze
on SMI. So it should not use the per-event interface (e.g. ioctl or
event attribute) to set FREEZE_WHILE_SMM bit.

Adds sysfs entry /sys/device/cpu/freeze_on_smi to set FREEZE_WHILE_SMM
bit in IA32_DEBUGCTL. When set, freezes perfmon and trace messages
while in SMM.

Value has to be 0 or 1. It will be applied to all processors.

Also serialize the entire setting so we don't get multiple concurrent
threads trying to update to different values.
