pinctrl: mvebu: add driver for Armada CP110 pinctrl

This commit adds a pinctrl driver for the CP110 part of the Marvell
Armada 7K and 8K SoCs. The Armada 7K has a single CP110, where almost all
the MPP pins are available. On the other side, the Armada 8K has two
CP110, and the available MPPs are split between the master CP110 (MPPs 32
to 62) and the slave CP110 (MPPs 0 to 31).

The register interface to control the MPPs is however the same as all
other mvebu SoCs, so we can reuse the common pinctrl-mvebu.c logic.
