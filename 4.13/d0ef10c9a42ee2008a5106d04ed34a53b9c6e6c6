scsi: hisi_sas: redefine hisi_sas_phy.phy_type as u32

Element phy_type is a bitmask and it only ever has 2 bits possibly set,
and it is overkill to define as a u64, so redefine as a u32.

This change resolves static code check complaint that "phy->phy_type &=
~PORT_TYPE_SAS;" would unintentionally clear the high 32 bits as well.

Structure hisi_sas_phy is also reordered to ensure packing efficiency.
