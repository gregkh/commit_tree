ovl: get exclusive ownership on upper/work dirs

Bad things can happen if several concurrent overlay mounts try to
use the same upperdir/workdir path.

Try to get the 'inuse' advisory lock on upperdir and workdir.
Fail mount if another overlay mount instance or another user
holds the 'inuse' lock on these directories.

Note that this provides no protection for concurrent overlay
mount that use overlapping (i.e. descendant) upper/work dirs.
