drm/i915: Lift timeline ordering to await_dma_fence

Currently we filter out repeated use of the same timeline in the low
level i915_gem_request_await_request(), after having added the
dependency on the old request. However, we can lift this to
i915_gem_request_await_dma_fence() (before the dependency is added)
using the observation that requests along the same timeline are
explicitly ordered via i915_add_request (along with the dependencies).
