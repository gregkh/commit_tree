Bluetooth: hci_ll: Add compatible values for more WL chips

Add compatible values for WiLink chips from 128x and 180x series.
Also the DT binding already contained compatible values for the 127x
series, but the driver did not. This brings the list on par with
the list from wlcore (the wifi driver).
