libnvdimm, label: update 'nlabel' and 'position' handling for local namespaces

The v1.2 namespace label specification requires 'nlabel' and 'position'
to be valid for the first ("lowest dpa") label in the set. It also
requires all non-first labels to set those fields to 0xff.

Linux does not much care if these values are correct, because we can
just trust the count of labels with the matching uuid like the v1.1
case. However, we set them correctly in case other environments care.
