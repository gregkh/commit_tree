Input: xpad - sync supported devices with XBCD

XBCD [0][1] is an OpenSource driver for Xbox controllers on Windows.
Later it also started supporting Xbox360 controllers (presumably before
the official Windows driver was released).

It contains a couple device IDs unknown to the Linux driver, so I extracted
those from xbcd.inf and added them to our list.

It has a special type for Wheels and I have the feeling they might need
some extra handling. They all have 'Wheel' in their name, so that
information is available for future improvements.
