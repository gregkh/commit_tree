mm: drop "wait" parameter from write_one_page()

The callers all set it to 1.

Also, make it clear that this function will not set any sort of AS_*
error, and that the caller must do so if necessary.  No existing caller
uses this on normal files, so none of them need it.

Also, add __must_check here since, in general, the callers need to handle
an error here in some fashion.
