KVM: SVM: don't NMI singlestep over event injection

Singlestepping is enabled by setting the TF flag and care must be
taken to not let the guest see (and reuse at an inconvenient time)
the modified rflag value. One such case is event injection, as part
of which flags are pushed on the stack and restored later on iret.

This commit disables singlestepping when we're about to inject an
event and forces an immediate exit for us to re-evaluate the NMI
related state.
