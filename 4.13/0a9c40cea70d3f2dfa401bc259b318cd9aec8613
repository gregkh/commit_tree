test_kmod: fix kmod.sh by making it executable

We had just forgotten to do this. Without this if we run the
following we get a permission denied:

sudo make -C tools/testing/selftests/kmod/ run_tests
make: Entering directory '/home/mcgrof/linux-next/tools/testing/selftests/kmod'
/bin/sh: ./kmod.sh: Permission denied
selftests:  kmod.sh [FAIL]
/home/mcgrof/linux-next/tools/testing/selftests/kmod
make: Leaving directory '/home/mcgrof/linux-next/tools/testing/selftests/kmod
