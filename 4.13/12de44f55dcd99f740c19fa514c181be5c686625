ARM: dts: imx: Fix Ethernet PHY reset polarity

The FEC driver ignores the GPIO polarity from 'phy-reset-gpios' and
considers that the Ethernet PHY is active low, unless the
property 'phy-reset-active-high' is present.

Fix the device tree description by explicitly passing the
'GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW' flag to the 'phy-reset-gpios' property.
