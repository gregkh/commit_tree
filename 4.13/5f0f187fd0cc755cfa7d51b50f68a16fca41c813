tty: add compat_ioctl callbacks

In order to avoid future diversions between fs/compat_ioctl.c and
drivers/tty/pty.c, define .compat_ioctl callbacks for the relevant
tty_operations structs. Since both pty_unix98_ioctl() and
pty_bsd_ioctl() are compatible between 32-bit and 64-bit userspace no
special translation is required.
