KVM: nVMX: do not fill vm_exit_intr_error_code in prepare_vmcs12

Do this in the caller of nested_vmx_vmexit instead.

nested_vmx_check_exception was doing a vmwrite to the vmcs02's
VM_EXIT_INTR_ERROR_CODE field, so that prepare_vmcs12 would move
the field to vmcs12->vm_exit_intr_error_code.  However that isn't
possible on pre-Haswell machines.  Moving the vmcs12 write to the
callers fixes it.
