ARM: dts: imx6-sabreauto: add the ADV7180 video decoder

Enables the ADV7180 decoder sensor. The ADV7180 connects to the
parallel-bus mux input on ipu1_csi0_mux.

The ADV7180 power pin is via max7310_b port expander.

Changes from Tim Harvey:
- Use IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW instead of 0x8 for interrupt type for clarity.
- For 8-bit parallel IPU1-CSI0 bus connection only data[12-19] are used.
