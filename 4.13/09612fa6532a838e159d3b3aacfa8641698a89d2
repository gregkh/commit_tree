mm: hugetlb: return immediately for hugetlb page in __delete_from_page_cache()

We avoid calling __mod_node_page_state(NR_FILE_PAGES) for hugetlb page
now, but it's not enough because later code doesn't handle hugetlb
properly.  Actually in our testing, WARN_ON_ONCE(PageDirty(page)) at the
end of this function fires for hugetlb, which makes no sense.  So we
should return immediately for hugetlb pages.
