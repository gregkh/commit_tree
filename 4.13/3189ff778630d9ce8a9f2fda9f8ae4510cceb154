btrfs: btrfs_wait_tree_block_writeback can be void return

Nothing checks its return value.

Is it safe to skip checking return value of btrfs_wait_tree_block_writeback?

Liu Bo: I think yes, it's used in walk_log_tree which is called in two
places, free_log_tree and log replay.  For free_log_tree, it waits for
any running writeback of the extent buffer under freeing to finish in
case we need to access the eb pointer from page->private, and it's OK to
not check the return value, while for log replay, it's doesn't wait
because wc->wait is not set. So neither cares about the writeback error.
