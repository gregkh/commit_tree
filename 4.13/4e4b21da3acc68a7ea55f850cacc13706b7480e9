l2tp: hold tunnel while handling genl TUNNEL_GET commands

Use l2tp_tunnel_get() instead of l2tp_tunnel_find() so that we get
a reference on the tunnel, preventing l2tp_tunnel_destruct() from
freeing it from under us.

Also move l2tp_tunnel_get() below nlmsg_new() so that we only take
the reference when needed.
