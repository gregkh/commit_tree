provide linux/set_memory.h

Currently code that wants to use set_memory_ro() etc, needs to include
asm/set_memory.h, which doesn't exist on all arches.  Some code knows it
only builds on arches which have the header, other code guards the
inclusion with an #ifdef, neither is ideal.

So create linux/set_memory.h.  This always exists, so users don't need
an #ifdef just to include the header.

When CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY=y it includes asm/set_memory.h,
otherwise it provides empty non-failing implementations.
