ACPICA: disassembler: improve Switch support

ACPICA commit 3c36625deffdfb034378b1793e2ead9c8fdd767e

Changes the resource descriptor parse tree walk to a general
preprocessing walk and calls the Switch conversion code from here.
Move Switch code to new dmswitch.c file. Also improves algorithm to
handle multiple levels of Switch statements and perform legacy
disassembly for older or otherwise non-spec compliant Switch
implementations.
