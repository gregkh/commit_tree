HID: multitouch: do not blindly set EV_KEY or EV_ABS bits

Now that input core insists on having dev->absinfo when device claims to
generate EV_ABS in its dev->evbit, we should not be blindly setting that
bit.

The code in question might have been needed before input_set_abs_params()
started setting EV_ABS in device's evbit, but not anymore, and is now
breaking devices such as SMART SPNL-6075 Touchscreen.
