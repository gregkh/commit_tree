ARCv2: PAE40: set MSB even if !CONFIG_ARC_HAS_PAE40 but PAE exists in SoC

PAE40 confiuration in hardware extends some of the address registers
for TLB/cache ops to 2 words.

So far kernel was NOT setting the higher word if feature was not enabled
in software which is wrong. Those need to be set to 0 in such case.

Normally this would be done in the cache flush / tlb ops, however since
these registers only exist conditionally, this would have to be
conditional to a flag being set on boot which is expensive/ugly -
specially for the more common case of PAE exists but not in use.
Optimize that by zero'ing them once at boot - nobody will write to
them afterwards
