mm/hugetlb: clean up ARCH_HAS_GIGANTIC_PAGE

This moves the #ifdef in C code to a Kconfig dependency.  Also we move
the gigantic_page_supported() function to be arch specific.

This allows architectures to conditionally enable runtime allocation of
gigantic huge page.  Architectures like ppc64 supports different
gigantic huge page size (16G and 1G) based on the translation mode
selected.  This provides an opportunity for ppc64 to enable runtime
allocation only w.r.t 1G hugepage.

No functional change in this patch.
