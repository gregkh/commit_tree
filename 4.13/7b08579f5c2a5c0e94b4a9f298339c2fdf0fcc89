tty: drop unused alt_speed from tty_struct

Drop the now unused alt_speed field from struct tty_struct.

Setting an alt_speed using the ASYNC_SPD flags has been deprecated since
v2.1.69, and has been broken for all tty drivers but serial-core since
v3.10 and commit 6865ff222cca ("TTY: do not warn about setting speed via
SPD_*") without anyone noticing.

Note that serial-core still supports changing speed using TIOCSSERIAL
and SPD flags (including "alt-speeds"), but also warns about it being
deprecated since pre-git.
