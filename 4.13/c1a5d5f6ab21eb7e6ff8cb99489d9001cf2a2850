ext4: improve journal credit handling in set xattr paths

Both ext4_set_acl() and ext4_set_context() need to be made aware of
ea_inode feature when it comes to credits calculation.

Also add a sufficient credits check in ext4_xattr_set_handle() right
after xattr write lock is grabbed. Original credits calculation is done
outside the lock so there is a possiblity that the initially calculated
credits are not sufficient anymore.
