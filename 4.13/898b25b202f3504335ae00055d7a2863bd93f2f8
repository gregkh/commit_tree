KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Simplify dynamic micro-threading code

Since commit b009031f74da ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Take out virtual
core piggybacking code", 2016-09-15), we only have at most one
vcore per subcore.  Previously, the fact that there might be more
than one vcore per subcore meant that we had the notion of a
"master vcore", which was the vcore that controlled thread 0 of
the subcore.  We also needed a list per subcore in the core_info
struct to record which vcores belonged to each subcore.  Now that
there can only be one vcore in the subcore, we can replace the
list with a simple pointer and get rid of the notion of the
master vcore (and in fact treat every vcore as a master vcore).

We can also get rid of the subcore_vm[] field in the core_info
struct since it is never read.
