btrfs: remove root usage from can_overcommit

can_overcommit using the root to determine the allocation profile
is the only use of a root in the call graph below reserve_metadata_bytes.

It turns out that we only need to know whether the allocation is for
the chunk root or not -- and we can pass that around as a bool instead.

This allows us to pull root usage out of the reservation path all the
way up to reserve_metadata_bytes itself, which uses it only to compare
against fs_info->chunk_root to set the bool.  In turn, this eliminates
a bunch of races where we use a particular root too early in the mount
process.
