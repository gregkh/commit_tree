btrfs: add quota override flag to enable quota override for CAP_SYS_RESOURCE

This patch introduces the quota override flag to btrfs_fs_info, and a
change to quota limit checking code to temporarily allow for quota to be
overridden for processes with CAP_SYS_RESOURCE.

It's useful for administrative programs, such as log rotation, that may
need to temporarily use more disk space in order to free up a greater
amount of overall disk space without yielding more disk space to the
rest of userland.

Eventually, we may want to add the idea of an operator-specific quota,
operator reserved space, or something else to allow for administrative
override, but this is perhaps the simplest solution.
