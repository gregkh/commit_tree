bcache.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Add a title for the document;
- Use a list for the listed URLs;
- mark literal blocks;
- adjust whitespaces;
- Don't capitalize section titles.
