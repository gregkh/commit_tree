mtd: nand: add generic helpers to check, match, maximize ECC settings

Driver are responsible for setting up ECC parameters correctly.
Those include:
  - Check if ECC parameters specified (usually by DT) are valid
  - Meet the chip's ECC requirement
  - Maximize ECC strength if NAND_ECC_MAXIMIZE flag is set

The logic can be generalized by factoring out common code.

This commit adds 3 helpers to the NAND framework:
nand_check_ecc_caps - Check if preset step_size and strength are valid
nand_match_ecc_req - Match the chip's requirement
nand_maximize_ecc - Maximize the ECC strength

To use the helpers above, a driver needs to provide:
  - Data array of supported ECC step size and strength
  - A hook that calculates ECC bytes from the combination of
    step_size and strength.

By using those helpers, code duplication among drivers will be
reduced.
