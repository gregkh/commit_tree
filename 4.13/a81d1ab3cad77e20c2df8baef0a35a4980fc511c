Revert "NFC: trf7970a: Handle extra byte in response to Type 5 RMB commands"

This reverts commit ab714817d7e891608d31f6996b1e4c43cf2bf342.

The original commit was designed to handle a bug in the trf7970a NFC
controller where an extra byte was returned in Read Multiple Blocks (RMB)
command responses.  However, it has become less clear whether it is a bug
in the trf7970a or in the tag.  In addition, it was assumed that the extra
byte was always returned but it turns out that is not always the case. The
result is that a byte of good data is trimmed off when the extra byte is
not present ultimately causing the neard deamon to fail the read.

Since the trf7970a driver does not have the context to know when to trim
the byte or not, remove the code from the trf7970a driver all together
(and move it up to the neard daemon).  This has the added benefit of
simplifying the kernel driver and putting the extra complexity into
userspace.
