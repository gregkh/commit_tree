printk-formats.txt: Better describe the difference between %pS and %pF

Sometimes people seems unclear when to use the %pS or %pF printk format.
For example, see commit 51d96dc2e2dc ("random: fix warning message on ia64
and parisc") which fixed such a wrong format string.

The documentation should be more clear about the difference.
