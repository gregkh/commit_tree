genetlink: remove ops_list from genetlink header.

commit d91824c08fbc ("genetlink: register family ops as array") removed the
ops_list member from both genl_family and genl_ops; while the
documentation of genl_family was updated accordingly by this patch,
ops_list remained in the documentation of the genl_ops object.
This patch fixes it by removing ops_list from genl_ops documentation.
