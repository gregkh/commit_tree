um: Use os_warn to print out pre-boot warning/error messages

Use os_warn() instead of printf/fprintf to print out
pre-boot warning/error messages to stderr.
Note that the help message and version message are
kept to print out to stdout, because user explicitly
specifies those options to get such information.
