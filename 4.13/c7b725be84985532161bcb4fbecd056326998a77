net: igmp: Use ingress interface rather than vrf device

Anuradha reported that statically added groups for interfaces enslaved
to a VRF device were not persisting. The problem is that igmp queries
and reports need to use the data in the in_dev for the real ingress
device rather than the VRF device. Update igmp_rcv accordingly.
