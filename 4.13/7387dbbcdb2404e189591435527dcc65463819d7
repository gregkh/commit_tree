mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix use-after-free in route replace

While working on IPv6 route replace I realized we can have a
use-after-free in IPv4 in case the replaced route is offloaded and the
only one using its FIB info.

The problem is that fib_table_insert() drops the reference on the FIB
info of the replaced routes which is eventually freed via call_rcu().
Since the driver doesn't hold a reference on this FIB info it can cause
a use-after-free when it tries to clear the RTNH_F_OFFLOAD flag stored
in fi->fib_flags.

After running the following commands in a loop for enough time with a
KASAN enabled kernel I finally got the below trace.

$ ip route add 192.168.50.0/24 via 192.168.200.1 dev enp3s0np3
$ ip route replace 192.168.50.0/24 dev enp3s0np5
$ ip route del 192.168.50.0/24 dev enp3s0np5

Fix this by taking a reference on the FIB info when creating the nexthop
group it represents and drop it when the group is destroyed.
