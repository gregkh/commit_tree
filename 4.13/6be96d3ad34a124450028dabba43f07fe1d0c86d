fs: return if direct I/O will trigger writeback

Find out if the I/O will trigger a wait due to writeback. If yes,
return -EAGAIN.

Return -EINVAL for buffered AIO: there are multiple causes of
delay such as page locks, dirty throttling logic, page loading
from disk etc. which cannot be taken care of.
