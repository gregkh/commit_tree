arm64: fix endianness annotation for reloc_insn_movw() & reloc_insn_imm()

Here the functions reloc_insn_movw() & reloc_insn_imm() are used
to read, modify and write back ARM instructions, which are always
stored in memory in little-endian order. These values are thus
correctly converted to/from native order but the pointers used to
hold their addresses are declared as for native order values.

Fix this by declaring the pointers as __le32* and remove the
casts that are now unneeded.
