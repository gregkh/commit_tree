platform/x86: wmi: Track wmi devices per ACPI device

Currently we free all devices when we detach from any ACPI node.
Instead, keep track of which node WMI devices are attached to and
free them only as needed. While we are at it, match up notifications
with the device they came from correctly.

This will make our behavior more straightforward on systems with
more than one WMI node in the ACPI tables (e.g. the Dell XPS 13
9350).

This also adds a warning when GUIDs are not unique.

NB: The guid_string parameter in guid_already_parsed was a
little-endian binary GUID, not a string.
