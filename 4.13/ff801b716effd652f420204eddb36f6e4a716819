sched/numa: Hide numa_wake_affine() from UP build

Stephen reported the following build warning in UP:

kernel/sched/fair.c:2657:9: warning: 'struct sched_domain' declared inside
parameter list
         ^
/home/sfr/next/next/kernel/sched/fair.c:2657:9: warning: its scope is only this
definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want

Hide the numa_wake_affine() inline stub on UP builds to get rid of it.

Fixes: 3fed382b46ba ("sched/numa: Implement NUMA node level wake_affine()")
