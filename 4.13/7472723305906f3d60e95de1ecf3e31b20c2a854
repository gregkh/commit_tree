kobject.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Add markups for titles;
- mark literal blocks as such;
- add needed whitespace/blank lines;
- use :Author: and :Last updated: for authorship.
