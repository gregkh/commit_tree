iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Add workaround for Cavium ThunderX2 erratum #74

Cavium ThunderX2 SMMU implementation doesn't support page 1 register space
and PAGE0_REGS_ONLY option is enabled as an errata workaround.
This option when turned on, replaces all page 1 offsets used for
EVTQ_PROD/CONS, PRIQ_PROD/CONS register access with page 0 offsets.

SMMU resource size checks are now based on SMMU option PAGE0_REGS_ONLY,
since resource size can be either 64k/128k.
For this, arm_smmu_device_dt_probe/acpi_probe has been moved before
platform_get_resource call, so that SMMU options are set beforehand.
