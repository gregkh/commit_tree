Bonding: Convert multiple netdev_info messages to netdev_dbg

The bond_options.c file contains multiple netdev_info statements that clutter kernel output.
This patch replaces all netdev_info with netdev_dbg and adds a netdev_dbg statement for the
packets per slave parameter. Also fixes misalignment at line 467.
