[media] cx18: Fix a sleep-in-atomic bug in snd_cx18_pcm_hw_free

The driver may sleep under a spin lock, and the function call path is:
snd_cx18_pcm_hw_free (acquire the lock by spin_lock_irqsave)
  vfree --> may sleep

To fix it, the "substream->runtime->dma_area" is passed to a temporary
value, and mark it NULL when holding the lock. The memory is freed by
vfree through the temporary value outside the lock holding.
