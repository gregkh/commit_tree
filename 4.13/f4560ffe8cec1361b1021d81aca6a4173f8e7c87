blk-mq: use QUEUE_FLAG_QUIESCED to quiesce queue

It is required that no dispatch can happen any more once
blk_mq_quiesce_queue() returns, and we don't have such requirement
on APIs of stopping queue.

But blk_mq_quiesce_queue() still may not block/drain dispatch in the
the case of BLK_MQ_S_START_ON_RUN, so use the new introduced flag of
QUEUE_FLAG_QUIESCED and evaluate it inside RCU read-side critical
sections for fixing this issue.

Also blk_mq_quiesce_queue() is implemented via stopping queue, which
limits its uses, and easy to cause race, because any queue restart in
other paths may break blk_mq_quiesce_queue(). With the introduced
flag of QUEUE_FLAG_QUIESCED, we don't need to depend on stopping queue
for quiescing any more.
