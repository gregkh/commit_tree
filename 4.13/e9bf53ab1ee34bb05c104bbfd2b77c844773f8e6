brcmfmac: feature check for multi-scheduled scan fails on bcm4343x devices

The firmware feature check introduced for multi-scheduled scan turned out
to be failing for bcm4343{0,1,8} devices resulting in a firmware crash.
The reason for this crash has not yet been root cause so this patch avoids
the feature check for those device as a short-term fix.
