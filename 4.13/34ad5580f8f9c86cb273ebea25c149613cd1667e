bpf: Add BPF_(PROG|MAP)_GET_NEXT_ID command

This patch adds BPF_PROG_GET_NEXT_ID and BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_ID
to allow userspace to iterate all bpf_prog IDs and bpf_map IDs.

The API is trying to be consistent with the existing
BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY.

It is currently limited to CAP_SYS_ADMIN which we can
consider to lift it in followup patches.
