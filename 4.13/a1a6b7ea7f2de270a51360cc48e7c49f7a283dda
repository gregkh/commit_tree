net: dsa: add cross-chip multicast support

Similarly to how cross-chip VLAN works, define a bitmap of multicast
group members for a switch, now including its DSA ports, so that
multicast traffic can be sent to all switches of the fabric.

A switch may drop the frames if no user port is a member.

This brings support for multicast in a multi-chip environment.
As of now, all switches of the fabric must support the multicast
operations in order to program a single fabric port.
