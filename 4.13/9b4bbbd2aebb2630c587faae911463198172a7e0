platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Add a comment about 0 in module_param_call()

As per discussion [1] there are only few users of module_param_call() in
kernel which prevent to read module parameters back.

It thinkpad_acpi driver there is even no method do so. Thus, for now,
add just a comment to explain why 0 is used as permissions in
module_param_call().
