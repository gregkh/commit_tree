dcb: enforce minimum length on IEEE_APPS attribute

Found by reviewing the warning about unused policy table.
The code implies that it meant to check for size, but since
it unrolled the loop for attribute validation that is never used.
Instead do explicit check for attribute.

Compile tested only. Needs review by original author.
