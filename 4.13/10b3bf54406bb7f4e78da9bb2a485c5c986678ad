sctp: fix an array overflow when all ext chunks are set

Marcelo noticed an array overflow caused by commit c28445c3cb07
("sctp: add reconf_enable in asoc ep and netns"), in which sctp
would add SCTP_CID_RECONF into extensions when reconf_enable is
set in sctp_make_init and sctp_make_init_ack.

Then now when all ext chunks are set, 4 ext chunk ids can be put
into extensions array while extensions array size is 3. It would
cause a kernel panic because of this overflow.

This patch is to fix it by defining extensions array size is 4 in
both sctp_make_init and sctp_make_init_ack.
