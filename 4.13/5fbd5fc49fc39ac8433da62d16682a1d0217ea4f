arm64: ptrace: Fix incorrect get_user() use in compat_vfp_set()

Now that compat_vfp_get() uses the regset API to copy the FPSCR
value out to userspace, compat_vfp_set() looks inconsistent.  In
particular, compat_vfp_set() will fail if called with kbuf != NULL
&& ubuf == NULL (which is valid usage according to the regset API).

This patch fixes compat_vfp_set() to use user_regset_copyin(),
similarly to compat_vfp_get().

This also squashes a sparse warning triggered by the cast that
drops __user when calling get_user().
