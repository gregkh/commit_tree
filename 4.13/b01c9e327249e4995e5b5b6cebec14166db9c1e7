ath9k: check ah->curchan when updating tx power

When driver fail to reset card ah->curchan value stay NULL. When
later driver try to update tx power it oops by using ah->curchan
(calltrace is shown below).

This problem were reported at various places and for some it was
fixed by making ath9k_hw_chip_reset() do not fail. I have this bug
report on some oldish RHEL kernel with AR9285, however it's hard to
debug where reset fail when kernel OOPS, so I think this patch
should be applied. Hopefully ah->curchan is not used unconditionally
on other places until is initialized on ath9k_config().
