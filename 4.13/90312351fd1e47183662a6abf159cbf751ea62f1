i2c: designware: MASTER mode as separated driver

- The functions related to I2C master mode of operation were transformed
  in a single driver.
- Common definitions were moved to i2c-designware-core.h
- The i2c-designware-core is now only a library file, the functions
  associated are in a source file called i2c-designware-common and
  are used by both i2c-designware-master and i2c-designware-slave.
- To decrease noise in namespace common i2c_dw_*() functions are
  now using ops to keep them private.
- Designware PCI driver had to be changed to match the previous ops
  functions implementation.

Almost all of the "core" source is now part of the "master" source. The
difference is the functions used by both modes and they are in the
"common" source file.
