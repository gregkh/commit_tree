rtc: introduce new registration method

Introduce rtc_register_device() to register an already allocated and
initialized struct rtc_device. It automatically sets up the owner and the
two steps allocation/registration will allow to remove race conditions in
the IRQ handling of some driver. It also allows to properly extend the core
without adding more arguments to rtc_device_register().
