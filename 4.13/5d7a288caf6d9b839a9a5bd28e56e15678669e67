ata-sff: always map page before data transfer

The XPFO [1] patchset may unmap pages from physmap if they happened to be
destined for userspace. If such a page is unmapped, it needs to be
remapped. Rather than test if a page is in the highmem/xpfo unmapped state,
Christoph suggested [2] that we simply always map the page.

v2: * drop comment about bounce buffer
    * don't save IRQs before kmap/unmap
    * formatting
