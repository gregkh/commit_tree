dt-bindings: phy: dp83867: provide a workaround for incorrect RX_CTRL pin strap

The data manual for DP83867IR/CR, SNLS484E[1], revised march 2017,
advises that strapping RX_DV/RX_CTRL pin in mode 1 and 2 is not
supported (see note below Table 5 (4-Level Strap Pins)).

It further advises that if a board has this pin strapped in mode 1 and
mode 2, then to ensure proper operation of the PHY, a software workaround
must be implemented.

Since it is not possible to detect in software if RX_DV/RX_CTRL pin is
incorrectly strapped, add a device-tree property for the board to
advertise this and allow corrective action in software.
