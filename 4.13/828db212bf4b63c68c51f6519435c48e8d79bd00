MIPS: Traced negative syscalls should return -ENOSYS

If a negative system call number is used when system call tracing is
enabled, syscall_trace_enter() will return that negative system call
number without having written the return value and error flag into the
pt_regs.

The caller then treats it as a cancelled system call and assumes that
the return value and error flag are already written, leaving the
negative system call number in the return register ($v0), and the 4th
system call argument in the error register ($a3).

Add a special case to detect this at the end of syscall_trace_enter(),
to set the return value to error -ENOSYS when this happens.
