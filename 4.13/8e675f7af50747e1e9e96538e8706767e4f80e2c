mm/oom_kill: count global and memory cgroup oom kills

Show count of oom killer invocations in /proc/vmstat and count of
processes killed in memory cgroup in knob "memory.events" (in
memory.oom_control for v1 cgroup).

Also describe difference between "oom" and "oom_kill" in memory cgroup
documentation.  Currently oom in memory cgroup kills tasks iff shortage
has happened inside page fault.

These counters helps in monitoring oom kills - for now the only way is
grepping for magic words in kernel log.
