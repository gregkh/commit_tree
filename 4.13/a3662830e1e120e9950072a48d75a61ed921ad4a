drm/i915/guc: Fix sleep under spinlock during reset

Looks like intel_guc_reset had the ability to sleep under the
uncore spinlock since forever but it wasn't detected until the
recent changes annotated the wait for register with might_sleep.

I have fixed it by removing holding of the uncore spinlock over
the call to gen6_hw_domain_reset, since I do not see that is
really needed. But there is always a possibility I am missing
some nasty detail so please double check.
