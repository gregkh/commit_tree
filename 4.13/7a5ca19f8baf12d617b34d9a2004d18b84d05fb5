drm/i915: Convert intel_hdmi connector properties to atomic

intel_hdmi supports 3 properties, force_audio, broadcast rgb and
scaling mode. The last one is only created for eDP, so the is_eDP
in set_property is not required.

panel fitting and broadcast rgb are straightforward and only requires
changing compute_config.

force_audio is also used to force DVI mode, which means changes to
compute_config and mode_valid. mode_valid is called with
connection_mutex held, so it can safely dereference connector->state.
