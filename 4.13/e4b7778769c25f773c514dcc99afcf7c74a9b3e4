net: dsa: assign default CPU port to all ports

The current code only assigns the default cpu_dp to all user ports of
the switch to which the CPU port belongs. The user ports of the other
switches of the fabric thus don't have a default CPU port.

This patch fixes this by assigning the cpu_dp of all user ports of all
switches of the fabric when the tree is fully parsed.
