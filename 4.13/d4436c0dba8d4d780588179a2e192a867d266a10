cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix ratio setting for min_perf_pct

When the minimum performance limit percentage is set to the power-up
default, it is possible that minimum performance ratio is off by one.

In the set_policy() callback the minimum ratio is calculated by
applying global.min_perf_pct to turbo_ratio and rounding up, but the
power-up default global.min_perf_pct is already rounded up to the
next percent in min_perf_pct_min().  That results in two round up
operations, so for the default min_perf_pct one of them is not
required.

It is better to remove rounding up in min_perf_pct_min() as this
matches the displayed min_perf_pct prior to commit c5a2ee7dde89
(cpufreq: intel_pstate: Active mode P-state limits rework) in 4.12.

For example on a platform with max turbo ratio of 37 and minimum
ratio of 10, the min_perf_pct resulted in 28 with the above commit.
Before this commit it was 27 and it will be the same after this
change.
