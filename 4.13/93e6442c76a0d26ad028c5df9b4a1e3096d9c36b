dm: add basic support for using the select or poll function

Add the ability to poll on the /dev/mapper/control device.  The select
or poll function waits until any event happens on any dm device since
opening the /dev/mapper/control device.  When select or poll returns the
device as readable, we must close and reopen the device to wait for new
dm events.

Usage:
1. open the /dev/mapper/control device
2. scan the event numbers of all devices we are interested in and process
   them
3. call select, poll or epoll on the handle (it waits until some new event
   happens since opening the device)
4. close the /dev/mapper/control handle
5. go to step 1

The next commit allows to re-arm the polling without closing and
reopening the device.
