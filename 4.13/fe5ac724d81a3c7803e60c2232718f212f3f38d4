rcu: Remove nohz_full full-system-idle state machine

The NO_HZ_FULL_SYSIDLE full-system-idle capability was added in 2013
by commit 0edd1b1784cb ("nohz_full: Add full-system-idle state machine"),
but has not been used.  This commit therefore removes it.

If it turns out to be needed later, this commit can always be reverted.
