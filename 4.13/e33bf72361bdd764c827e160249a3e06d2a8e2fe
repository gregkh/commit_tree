Btrfs: fix dir item validation when replaying xattr deletes

We were passing an incorrect slot number to the function that validates
directory items when we are replaying xattr deletes from a log tree. The
correct slot is stored at variable 'i' and not at 'path->slots[0]', so
the call to the validation function was only correct for the first
iteration of the loop, when 'i == path->slots[0]'.
After this fix, the fstest generic/066 passes again.
