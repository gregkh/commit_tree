PCI / PM: Restore PME Enable after config space restoration

Commit dc15e71eefc7 (PCI / PM: Restore PME Enable if skipping wakeup
setup) introduced a mechanism by which the PME Enable bit can be
restored by pci_enable_wake() if dev->wakeup_prepared is set in
case it has been overwritten by PCI config space restoration.

However, that commit overlooked the fact that on some systems (Dell
XPS13 9360 in particular) the AML handling wakeup events checks PME
Status and PME Enable and it won't trigger a Notify() for devices
where those bits are not set while it is running.

That happens during resume from suspend-to-idle when pci_restore_state()
invoked by pci_pm_default_resume_early() clears PME Enable before the
wakeup events are processed by AML, effectively causing those wakeup
events to be ignored.

Fix this issue by restoring the PME Enable configuration right after
pci_restore_state() has been called instead of doing that in
pci_enable_wake().
