powerpc/64: Drop reservation-clearing ldarx in context switch

There is no need to explicitly break the reservation in _switch,
because we are guaranteed that the context switch path will include a
larx/stcx.

Comment the guarantee and remove the reservation clear from _switch.

This is worth 1-2% in context switch performance.
