drm/i915/gvt: remove redundant -Wall

This flag is already set in the top level Makefile of the kernel.

Also, by having set CONFIG_DRM_I915_GVT, thereby appending -Wall to
ccflags, you undo all the -Wno-* cflags previously set in the Make
variable KBUILD_CFLAGS.

For example:

cc foo.c -Wall -Wno-format -Wall

resets -Wformat.
