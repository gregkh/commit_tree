[media] pxa_camera: Add remaining Bayer 8 formats

This patch adds Bayer 8 GBRG and RGGB support and move GRBG definition
close to BGGR (so all Bayer 8 variants are together). No other changes are
needed as the driver handles them as RAW data stream.

The RGGB variant was tested in a modified OV9640 driver.
