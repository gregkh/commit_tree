ubifs: allow userspace to map mounts to volumes

There currently appears to be no way for userspace to find out the
underlying volume number for a mounted ubifs file system, since ubifs
uses anonymous block devices.  The volume name is present in
/proc/mounts but UBI volumes can be renamed after the volume has been
mounted.

To remedy this, show the UBI number and UBI volume number as part of the
options visible under /proc/mounts.

Also, accept and ignore the ubi= vol= options if they are used mounting
(patch from Richard Weinberger).

 # mount -t ubifs ubi:baz x
 # mount
 ubi:baz on /root/x type ubifs (rw,relatime,ubi=0,vol=2)
 # ubirename /dev/ubi0 baz bazz
 # mount
 ubi:baz on /root/x type ubifs (rw,relatime,ubi=0,vol=2)
 # ubinfo -d 0 -n 2
 Volume ID:   2 (on ubi0)
