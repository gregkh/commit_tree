KVM: arm/arm64: timer: remove request-less vcpu kick

The timer work is only scheduled for a VCPU when that VCPU is
blocked. This means we only need to wake it up, not kick (IPI)
it. While calling kvm_vcpu_kick() would just do the wake up,
and not kick, anyway, let's change this to avoid request-less
vcpu kicks, as they're generally not a good idea (see
"Request-less VCPU Kicks" in
Documentation/virtual/kvm/vcpu-requests.rst)
