srcu: Shrink srcu.h by moving docbook and private function

The call_srcu() docbook entry is currently in include/linux/srcu.h,
which causes needless processing for each include point.  This commit
therefore moves this entry to kernel/rcu/srcutree.c, which the compiler
reads only once.  In addition, the srcu_batches_completed() function is
used only within RCU and its torture-test suites.  This commit therefore
also moves this function's declaration from include/linux/srcutiny.h,
include/linux/srcutree.h, and include/linux/srcuclassic.h to
kernel/rcu/rcu.h.
