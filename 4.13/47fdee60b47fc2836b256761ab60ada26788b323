ima: use ima_parse_buf() to parse measurements headers

The binary_hdr_v1 and binary_data_v1 structures defined in
ima_restore_measurement_list() have been replaced with an array of four
ima_field_data structures where pcr, digest, template name and
template data lengths and pointers are stored.

The length of pcr and digest in the ima_field_data array and the bits
in the bitmap are set before ima_parse_buf() is called. The ENFORCE_FIELDS
bit is set for all entries except the last one (there is still data to
parse), and ENFORCE_BUFEND is set only for the last entry.
