cdc_ncm: Set NTB format again after altsetting switch for Huawei devices

Some firmwares in Huawei E3372H devices have been observed to switch back
to NTB 32-bit format after altsetting switch.
This patch implements a driver flag to check for the device settings and
set NTB format to 16-bit again if needed.
The flag has been activated for devices controlled by the huawei_cdc_ncm.c
driver.

V1->V2:
- fixed broken error checks
- some corrections to the commit message
V2->V3:
- variable name changes, to clarify what's happening
- check (and possibly set) the NTB format later in the common bind code path
