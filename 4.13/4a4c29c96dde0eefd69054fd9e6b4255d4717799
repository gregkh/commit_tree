xen: add sysfs node for guest type

Currently there is no reliable user interface inside a Xen guest to
determine its type (e.g. HVM, PV or PVH). Instead of letting user mode
try to determine this by various rather hacky mechanisms (parsing of
boot messages before they are gone, trying to make use of known subtle
differences in behavior of some instructions), add a sysfs node
/sys/hypervisor/guest_type to explicitly deliver this information as
it is known to the kernel.
