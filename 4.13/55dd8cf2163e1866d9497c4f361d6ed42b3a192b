Revert "qla2xxx: Fix incorrect tcm_qla2xxx_free_cmd use during TMR ABORT"

This reverts commit 5f572526a18418258bfa137e3353656c25439500.

As reported by Pascal here:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/target-devel/msg15808.html

there still appears to be another issue related to this change
to drop the original bogus tcm_qla2xxx_free_cmd() usage from
tcm_qla2xxx_handle_data_work() and tcm_qla2xxx_aborted_task().

So revert this for now, until Pascal can verify with further
debug in place to understand what's going on.
