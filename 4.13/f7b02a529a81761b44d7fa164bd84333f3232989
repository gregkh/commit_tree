drm/i915: Skip waking the signaler when enabling before request submission

If we are enabling the breadcrumbs signaling prior to submitting the
request, we know that we cannot have missed the interrupt and can
therefore skip immediately waking the signaler to check.

This reduces a significant chunk of the __i915_gem_request_submit()
overhead for inter-engine synchronisation, for example in gem_exec_whisper.
