powerpc/mm/hash: Refactor hash__mark_rodata_ro()

Move the core logic into a helper, so we can use it for changing other
permissions.

We also change the logic to align start down, and end up. This means
calling the function with a range will expand that range to be at
least 1 mmu_linear_psize page in size. We need that so we can use it
on __init_begin ...  __init_end which is not a full page in size.

This should always work for _stext/__init_begin, because we align
__init_begin to _stext + 16M in the linker script.
