vhost/vsock: use static minor number

Vhost-vsock is a software device so there is no probe call that causes
the driver to register its misc char device node.  This creates a
chicken and egg problem: userspace applications must open
/dev/vhost-vsock to use the driver but the file doesn't exist until the
kernel module has been loaded.

Use the devname modalias mechanism so that /dev/vhost-vsock is created
at boot.  The vhost_vsock kernel module is automatically loaded when the
first application opens /dev/host-vsock.

Note that the "reserved for local use" range in
Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt is incorrect.  The userio driver
already occupies part of that range.  I've updated the documentation
accordingly.
