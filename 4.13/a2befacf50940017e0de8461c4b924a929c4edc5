KVM: arm64: Allow creating the PMU without the in-kernel GIC

Since we got support for devices in userspace which allows reporting the
PMU overflow output status to userspace, we should actually allow
creating the PMU on systems without an in-kernel irqchip, which in turn
requires us to slightly clarify error codes for the ABI and move things
around for the initialization phase.
