target: use idr for se_device dev index

In the next patches we will add tcmu netlink support that allows
userspace to send commands to target_core_user. To execute operations
on a se_device/tcmu_dev we need to be able to look up a dev by any old
id. This patch replaces the se_device->dev_index with a idr created
id.

The next patches will also remove the g_device_list and replace it with
the idr.
