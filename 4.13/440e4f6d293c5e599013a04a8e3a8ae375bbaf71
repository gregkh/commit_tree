hw_random.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- use proper markups for titles;
- adjust section identation;
- use proper markup for notes and fix it to properly show the
  numbered list.
