mm/hugetlb.c: __get_user_pages ignores certain follow_hugetlb_page errors

Commit 9a291a7c9428 ("mm/hugetlb: report -EHWPOISON not -EFAULT when
FOLL_HWPOISON is specified") causes __get_user_pages to ignore certain
errors from follow_hugetlb_page.  After such error, __get_user_pages
subsequently calls faultin_page on the same VMA and start address that
follow_hugetlb_page failed on instead of returning the error immediately
as it should.

In follow_hugetlb_page, when hugetlb_fault returns a value covered under
VM_FAULT_ERROR, follow_hugetlb_page returns it without setting nr_pages
to 0 as __get_user_pages expects in this case, which causes the
following to happen in __get_user_pages: the "while (nr_pages)" check
succeeds, we skip the "if (!vma..." check because we got a VMA the last
time around, we find no page with follow_page_mask, and we call
faultin_page, which calls hugetlb_fault for the second time.

This issue also slightly changes how __get_user_pages works.  Before, it
only returned error if it had made no progress (i = 0).  But now,
follow_hugetlb_page can clobber "i" with an error code since its new
return path doesn't check for progress.  So if "i" is nonzero before a
failing call to follow_hugetlb_page, that indication of progress is lost
and __get_user_pages can return error even if some pages were
successfully pinned.

To fix this, change follow_hugetlb_page so that it updates nr_pages,
allowing __get_user_pages to fail immediately and restoring the "error
only if no progress" behavior to __get_user_pages.

Tested that __get_user_pages returns when expected on error from
hugetlb_fault in follow_hugetlb_page.
