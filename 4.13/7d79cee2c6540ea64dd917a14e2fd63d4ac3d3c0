ARCv2: PAE40: Explicitly set MSB counterpart of SLC region ops addresses

It is necessary to explicitly set both SLC_AUX_RGN_START1 and SLC_AUX_RGN_END1
which hold MSB bits of the physical address correspondingly of region start
and end otherwise SLC region operation is executed in unpredictable manner

Without this patch, SLC flushes on HSDK (IOC disabled) were taking
seconds.
