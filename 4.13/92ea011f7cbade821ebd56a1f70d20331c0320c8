SUNRPC: Make slot allocation more reliable

In xprt_alloc_slot(), the spin lock is only needed to provide atomicity
between the atomic_add_unless() failure and the call to xprt_add_backlog().
We do not actually need to hold it across the memory allocation itself.

By dropping the lock, we can use a more resilient GFP_NOFS allocation,
just as we now do in the rest of the RPC client code.
