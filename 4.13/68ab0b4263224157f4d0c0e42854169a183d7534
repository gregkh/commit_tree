rcu: Make synchronize_rcu_mult() check for duplicates

Currently, doing synchronize_rcu_mult(call_rcu, call_rcu) might
(or might not) wait for two RCU grace periods.  One approach is
of course "don't do that!", but in CONFIG_PREEMPT=n kernels,
synchronize_rcu_mult(call_rcu, call_rcu_sched) does exactly that.
This results in an ugly #ifdef in sched_cpu_deactivate().

This commit therefore makes __wait_rcu_gp() check for duplicates,
which in turn allows duplicates to be passed to synchronize_rcu_mult()
without risk of waiting twice on the same type of grace period.
