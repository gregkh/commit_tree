IB/ipoib: Clean error paths in add port

Refactor error paths in ipoib_add_port() function. The code flow
ensures that the function terminates on every error flow and it makes
redundant all "else" cases.

The functions are called during the flow are returning "result < 0", in
case of error, so there is no need to check it explicitly.
