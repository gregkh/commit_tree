fault-inject: parse as natural 1-based value for fail-nth write interface

The value written to fail-nth file is parsed as 0-based.  Parsing as
one-based is more natural to understand and it enables to cancel the
previous setup by simply writing '0'.

This change also converts task->fail_nth from signed to unsigned int.
