Revert "iommu/io-pgtable: Avoid redundant TLB syncs"

The tlb_sync_pending flag was necessary for correctness in the Mediatek
M4U driver, but since it offered a small theoretical optimisation for
all io-pgtable users it was implemented as a high-level thing. However,
now that some users may not be using a synchronising lock, there are
several ways this flag can go wrong for them, and at worst it could
result in incorrect behaviour.

Since we've addressed the correctness issue within the Mediatek driver
itself, and fixing the optimisation aspect to be concurrency-safe would
be quite a headache (and impose extra overhead on every operation for
the sake of slightly helping one case which will virtually never happen
in typical usage), let's just retire it.

This reverts commit 88492a4700360a086e55d8874ad786105a5e8b0f.
