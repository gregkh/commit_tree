pnp.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Use a markup for document title;
- use :Author: and :Last updated: for authorship;
- adjust whitespaces where needed;
- mark literal blocks;
- fix a few subtitle markups.
