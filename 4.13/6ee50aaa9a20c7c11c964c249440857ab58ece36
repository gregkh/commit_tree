platform/x86: wmi: Instantiate all devices before adding them

At some point, we will want sub-drivers to get references to other
devices on the same WMI bus. This change is needed to avoid races.

This ends up simplifying the setup code and fixing some leaks, too.

This is based on the original work of Andy Lutomirski <luto@kernel.org>,
but includes several modifications, many in response to review from
Michał Kępień <kernel@kempniu.pl>:
