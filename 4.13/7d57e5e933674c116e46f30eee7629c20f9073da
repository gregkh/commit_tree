vfio/pci: Add Intel XXV710 to hidden INTx devices

XXV710 has the same broken INTx behavior as the rest of the X/XL710
series, the interrupt status register is not wired to report pending
INTx interrupts, thus we never associate the interrupt to the device.
Extend the device IDs to include these so that we hide that the
device supports INTx at all to the user.
