bnxt_en: Fix SRIOV on big-endian architecture.

The PF driver sets up a list of firmware commands from the VF driver that
needs to be forwarded to the PF for approval.  This list is a 256-bit
bitmap.  The code that sets up the bitmap falls apart on big-endian
architecture.  __set_bit() does not work because it operates on long types
whereas the firmware interface is defined in u32 types, causing bits in
the wrong 32-bit word to be set.

Fix it by setting the proper bits on an array of u32.

Fixes: de68f5de5651 ("bnxt_en: Fix bitmap declaration to work on 32-bit arches.")
