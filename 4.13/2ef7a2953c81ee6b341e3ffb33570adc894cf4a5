arm, arm64: factorize common cpu capacity default code

arm and arm64 share lot of code relative to parsing CPU capacity
information from DT, using that information for appropriate scaling and
exposing a sysfs interface for chaging such values at runtime.

Factorize such code in a common place (driver/base/arch_topology.c) in
preparation for further additions.
