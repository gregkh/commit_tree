IB/{rdmavt, qib, hfi1}: Remove gfp flags argument

The caller to the driver marks GFP_NOIO allocations with help
of memalloc_noio-* calls now. This makes redundant to pass down
to the driver gfp flags, which can be GFP_KERNEL only.

The patch removes the gfp flags argument and updates all driver paths.
