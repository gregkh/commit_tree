DMA-API-HOWTO.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Mark titles;
- Mark literal blocks;
- Mark some literals that would otherwise produce warnings;
- Mark authorship.
