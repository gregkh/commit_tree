efi/arm: Enable DMI/SMBIOS

Wire up the existing arm64 support for SMBIOS tables (aka DMI) for ARM as
well, by moving the arm64 init code to drivers/firmware/efi/arm-runtime.c
(which is shared between ARM and arm64), and adding a asm/dmi.h header to
ARM that defines the mapping routines for the firmware tables.

This allows userspace to access these tables to discover system information
exposed by the firmware. It also sets the hardware name used in crash
dumps, e.g.:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
  pgd = ed3c0000
  [00000000] *pgd=bf1f3835
  Internal error: Oops: 817 [#1] SMP THUMB2
  Modules linked in:
  CPU: 0 PID: 759 Comm: bash Not tainted 4.10.0-09601-g0e8f38792120-dirty #112
  Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015
  ^^^

NOTE: This does *NOT* enable or encourage the use of DMI quirks, i.e., the
      the practice of identifying the platform via DMI to decide whether
      certain workarounds for buggy hardware and/or firmware need to be
      enabled. This would require the DMI subsystem to be enabled much
      earlier than we do on ARM, which is non-trivial.
