Revert "PM / Domains: Handle safely genpd_syscore_switch() call on non-genpd device"

Revert commit 8b55e55ee443 (PM / Domains: Handle safely
genpd_syscore_switch() call on non-genpd device) which was misguided
(the change made by it was not necessary) and it introduced a call to
a function that may sleep into an atomic context code path.
