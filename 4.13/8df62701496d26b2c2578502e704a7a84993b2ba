pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7791: Add R8A7743 support

Renesas RZ/G1M (R8A7743) is pin compatible with R-Car M2-W/N (R8A7791/3),
however it doesn't have several automotive specific peripherals.  Annotate
all the items that only exist on the R-Car SoCs and only supply the pin
groups/functions existing on a given SoC...
