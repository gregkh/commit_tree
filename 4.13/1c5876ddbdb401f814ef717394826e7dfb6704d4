sunrpc: move p_count out of struct rpc_procinfo

p_count is the only writeable memeber of struct rpc_procinfo, which is
a good candidate to be const-ified as it contains function pointers.

This patch moves it into out out struct rpc_procinfo, and into a
separate writable array that is pointed to by struct rpc_version and
indexed by p_statidx.
