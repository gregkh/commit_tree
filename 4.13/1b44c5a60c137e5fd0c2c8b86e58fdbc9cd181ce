crypto: inside-secure - add SafeXcel EIP197 crypto engine driver

Add support for Inside Secure SafeXcel EIP197 cryptographic engine,
which can be found on Marvell Armada 7k and 8k boards. This driver
currently implements: ecb(aes), cbc(aes), sha1, sha224, sha256 and
hmac(sah1) algorithms.

Two firmwares are needed for this engine to work. Their are mostly used
for more advanced operations than the ones supported (as of now), but we
still need them to pass the data to the internal cryptographic engine.
