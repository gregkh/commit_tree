ARM: NOMMU: Set ARM_DMA_MEM_BUFFERABLE for M-class cpus

Now, we have dedicated non-cacheable region for consistent DMA
operations. However, that region can still be marked as bufferable by
MPU, so it'd be safer to have barriers by default. M-class machines
that didn't need it until now also likely won't need it in the future,
therefore, we offer this as an option.
