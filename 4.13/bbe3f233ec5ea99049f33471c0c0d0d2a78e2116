qed: Assign a unique per-queue index to queue-cid

When a queue-cid is allocated, assign an index inside that's
CID's queue-zone.

For PFs and VFS, this number is going to be unique and derive
from a per-queue-zone bitmap, while for PF's VFs queues the
number is currently going to constant; Later, we'd add the
capability of a VF to communicate such an index to its PF.
