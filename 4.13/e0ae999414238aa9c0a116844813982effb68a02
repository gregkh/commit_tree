btrfs: preallocate device flush bio

For devices that support flushing, we allocate a bio, submit, wait for
it and then free it. The bio allocation does not fail so ENOMEM is not a
problem but we still may unnecessarily stress the allocation subsystem.

Instead, we can allocate the bio at the same time we allocate the device
and reuse it each time we need to flush the barriers. The bio is reset
before each use. Reference counting is simplified to just device
allocation (get) and freeing (put).

The bio used to be submitted through the integrity checker which will
find out that bio has no data attached and call submit_bio.

Status of the bio in flight needs to be tracked separately in case the
device caches get switched off between write and wait.
