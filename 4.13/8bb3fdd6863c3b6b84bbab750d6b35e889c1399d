s390: rename psw_bits enums

The address space enums that must be used when modifying the address
space part of a psw with the psw_bits() macro can easily be confused
with the psw defines that are used to mask and compare directly the
mask part of a psw.
We have e.g. PSW_AS_PRIMARY vs PSW_ASC_PRIMARY.

To avoid confusion rename the PSW_AS_* enums to PSW_BITS_AS_*.

In addition also rename the PSW_AMODE_* enums, so they also follow the
same naming scheme: PSW_BITS_AMODE_*.
