drm/vc4: Adjust modes in DSI to work around the integer PLL divider.

BCM2835's PLLD_DSI1 divider doesn't give us many choices for our pixel
clocks, so to support panels on the Raspberry Pi we need to set a
higher pixel clock rate than requested and adjust the mode we program
to extend out the HFP so that the refresh rate matches.
