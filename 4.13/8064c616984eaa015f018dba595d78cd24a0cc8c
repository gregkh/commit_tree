i2c: cadance: fix ctrl/addr reg write order

The driver was clearing the hold bit in the control register before
writing to the address register which resulted in a stop condition
being generated rather than a repeated start.

This issue was only observed when a system was running much
slower than a normal processor would execute.  The IP data sheet
mentions a ordering of writing to the address register before
clearing the hold.
