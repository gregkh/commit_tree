drm/i915/dp: use the sink rates array for max sink rates

Looking at DPCD DP_MAX_LINK_RATE may be completely bogus for eDP 1.4
which is allowed to use link rate select method and have 0 in max link
rate. With this change, it makes sense to store the max rate as the
actual rate rather than as a bw code.
