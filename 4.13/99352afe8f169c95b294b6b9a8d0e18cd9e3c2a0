mtd: extract TRX parser out of bcm47xxpart into a separated module

This makes TRX parsing code reusable with other platforms and parsers.

Please note this patch doesn't really change anything in the existing
code, just moves it. There is still some place for improvement (e.g.
working on non-hacky method of checking rootfs format) but it's not
really a subject of this change.
