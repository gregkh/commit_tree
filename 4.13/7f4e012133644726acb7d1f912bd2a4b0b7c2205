btmrvl.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Use the right notation for titles;
- Use a list for image names;
- Use literal blocks where needed;
- Whitespace fixes.
