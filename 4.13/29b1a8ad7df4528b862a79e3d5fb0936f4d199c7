tracing: Attempt to record other information even if some fail

In recent patches where we record comm and tgid at the same time, we skip
continuing to record if any fail. Fix that by trying to record as many things
as we can even if some couldn't be recorded. If any information isn't recorded,
then we don't set trace_taskinfo_save as before.
