crypto: inside-secure - fix invalidation check in hmac_sha1_setkey

The safexcel_hmac_sha1_setkey function checks if an invalidation command
should be issued, i.e. when the context ipad/opad change. This checks is
done after filling the ipad/opad which and it can't be true. The patch
fixes this by moving the check before the ipad/opad memcpy operations.
