NFC: trf7970a: fix check of clock frequencies, use && instead of ||

The "or" condition (clk_freq != TRF7970A_27MHZ_CLOCK_FREQUENCY) ||
(clk_freq != TRF7970A_13MHZ_CLOCK_FREQUE) will always be true because
clk_freq cannot be equal to two different values at the same time. Use
the  && operator instead of || to fix this.
