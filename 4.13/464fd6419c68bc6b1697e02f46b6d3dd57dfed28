ibmvscsis: Enable Logical Partition Migration Support

Changes to support a new mechanism from phyp to better synchronize the
logical partition migration (LPM) of the client partition.
This includes a new VIOCTL to register that we support this new
functionality, and 2 new Transport Event types, and finally another
new VIOCTL to let phyp know once we're ready for the Suspend.
