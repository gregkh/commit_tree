net: dsa: include dsa.h only once

The public include/net/dsa.h file is meant for DSA drivers, while all
DSA core files share a common private header net/dsa/dsa_priv.h file.

Ensure that dsa_priv.h is the only DSA core file to include net/dsa.h,
and add a new line to separate absolute and relative headers at the same
time.
