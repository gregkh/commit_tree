btrfs: Manually implement device_total_bytes getter/setter

The device->total_bytes member needs to always be rounded down to sectorsize
so that it corresponds to the value of super->total_bytes. However, there are
multiple places where the setter is fed a value which is not rounded which
can cause a fs to be unmountable due to the check introduced in
99e3ecfcb9f4 ("Btrfs: add more validation checks for superblock"). This patch
implements the getter/setter manually so that in a later patch I can add
necessary code to catch offenders.
