arm64: allwinner: a64: bananapi-m64: add missing ethernet0 alias

The EMAC Ethernet controller was enabled, but an accompanying alias
was not added. This results in unstable numbering if other Ethernet
devices, such as a USB dongle, are present. Also, the bootloader uses
the alias to assign a generated stable MAC address to the device node.
