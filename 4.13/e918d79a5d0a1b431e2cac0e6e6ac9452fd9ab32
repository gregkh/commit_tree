drm/i915/cnl: Add Cannonlake PCI IDs for U-skus.

Platform enabling and its power-on are organized in different
skus (U x Y x S x H, etc). So instead of organizing it in
GT1 x GT2 x GT3 let's also use the platform sku.

This is also the new Spec style what makes the review much
more easy and straightforward.

v2: Really include the PCI IDs to the picidlist[];
v3: Remove PCI IDs not present in spec.
v4: Rebase.
