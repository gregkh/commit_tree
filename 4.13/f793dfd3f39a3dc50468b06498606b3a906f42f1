blk-mq: expose write hints through debugfs

Useful to verify that things are working the way they should.
Reading the file will return number of kb written with each
write hint. Writing the file will reset the statistics. No care
is taken to ensure that we don't race on updates.

Drivers will write to q->write_hints[] if they handle a given
write hint.
