bpf: Remove the capability check for cgroup skb eBPF program

Currently loading a cgroup skb eBPF program require a CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability while attaching the program to a cgroup only requires the
user have CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege. We can escape the capability
check when load the program just like socket filter program to make
the capability requirement consistent.

Change since v1:
Change the code style in order to be compliant with checkpatch.pl
preference
