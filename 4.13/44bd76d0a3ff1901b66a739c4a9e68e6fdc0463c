platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: constify attribute_group structures.

attribute_groups are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with attribute_groups provided by <linux/sysfs.h> work
with const attribute_group. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  26360	   1072	     24	  27456	   6b40	drivers/platform/x86/toshiba_acpi.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  26424	   1008	     24	  27456	   6b40	drivers/platform/x86/toshiba_acpi.o
