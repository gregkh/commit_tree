dt-bindings: qoriq-clock: Add coreclk

ls1012a has separate input root clocks for core PLLs versus the platform
PLL, with the latter described as sysclk in the hw docs.
Update the qoriq-clock binding to allow a second input clock, named
"coreclk".  If present, this clock will be used for the core PLLs.
