ALSA: pcm: tracepoints for refining PCM parameters

When working for devices which support configurable modes for its data
transmission or which consists of several components, developers are
likely to use rules of parameters of PCM substream. However, there's no
infrastructure to assist their work.

In old days, ALSA PCM core got a local 'RULES_DEBUG' macro to debug
refinement of parameters for PCM substream. Although this is merely a
makeshift. With some modifications, we get the infrastructure.

This commit is for the purpose. Refinement of mask/interval type of
PCM parameters is probed as tracepoint events as 'hw_mask_param' and
'hw_interval_param' on existent 'snd_pcm' subsystem.
