ext4: cleanup transaction restarts during inode deletion

During inode deletion, the number of journal credits that will be
needed is hard to determine.  For that reason we have journal
extend/restart calls in several places.  Whenever a transaction is
restarted, filesystem must be in a consistent state because there is
no atomicity guarantee beyond a restart call.

Add ext4_xattr_ensure_credits() helper function which takes care of
journal extend/restart logic.  It also handles getting jbd2 write
access and dirty metadata calls.  This function is called at every
iteration of handling an ea_inode reference.
