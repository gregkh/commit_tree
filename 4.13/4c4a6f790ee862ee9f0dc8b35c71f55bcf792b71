KVM: nVMX: track NMI blocking state separately for each VMCS

vmx_recover_nmi_blocking is using a cached value of the guest
interruptibility info, which is stored in vmx->nmi_known_unmasked.
vmx_recover_nmi_blocking is run for both normal and nested guests,
so the cached value must be per-VMCS.

This fixes eventinj.flat in a nested non-EPT environment.  With EPT it
works, because the EPT violation handler doesn't have the
vmx->nmi_known_unmasked optimization (it is unnecessary because, unlike
vmx_recover_nmi_blocking, it can just look at the exit qualification).

Thanks to Wanpeng Li for debugging the testcase and providing an initial
patch.
