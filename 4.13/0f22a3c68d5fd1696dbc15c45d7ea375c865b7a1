vxlan: check valid combinations of address scopes

* Multicast addresses are never valid as local address
* Link-local IPv6 unicast addresses may only be used as remote when the
  local address is link-local as well
* Don't allow link-local IPv6 local/remote addresses without interface

We also store in the flags field if link-local addresses are used for the
follow-up patches that actually make VXLAN over link-local IPv6 work.
