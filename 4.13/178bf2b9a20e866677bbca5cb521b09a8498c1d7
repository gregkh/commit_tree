sparc64: optimize loads in clock_sched()

In clock sched we now have three loads:
	- Function pointer
	- quotient for multiplication
	- offset

However, it is possible to improve performance substantially, by
guaranteeing that all three loads are from the same cacheline.

By moving these three values first in sparc64_tick_ops, and by having
tick_operations 64-byte aligned we guarantee this.
