staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Update number of netdev queues

Currently, the netdevice is allocated with a default number of Rx/Tx
queues equal to CONFIG_NR_CPUS, meaning the maximum number of cores
supported by the current kernel. The actual number of queues is
reflected by the DPNI object attribute, so update the netdevice
configuration based on that.
