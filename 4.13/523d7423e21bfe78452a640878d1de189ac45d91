iommu/arm-smmu: Remove io-pgtable spinlock

With the io-pgtable code now robust against (valid) races, we no longer
need to serialise all operations with a lock. This might make broken
callers who issue concurrent operations on overlapping addresses go even
more wrong than before, but hey, they already had little hope of useful
or deterministic results.

We do however still have to keep a lock around to serialise the ATS1*
translation ops, as parallel iova_to_phys() calls could lead to
unpredictable hardware behaviour otherwise.
