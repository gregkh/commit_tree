bio-integrity: fix interface for bio_integrity_trim

bio_integrity_trim inherent it's interface from bio_trim and accept
offset and size, but this API is error prone because data offset
must always be insync with bio's data offset. That is why we have
integrity update hook in bio_advance()

So only meaningful values are: offset == 0, sectors == bio_sectors(bio)
Let's just remove them completely.
