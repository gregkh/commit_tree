net: sched: set xt_tgchk_param par.nft_compat as 0 in ipt_init_target

Commit 55917a21d0cc ("netfilter: x_tables: add context to know if
extension runs from nft_compat") introduced a member nft_compat to
xt_tgchk_param structure.

But it didn't set it's value for ipt_init_target. With unexpected
value in par.nft_compat, it may return unexpected result in some
target's checkentry.

This patch is to set all it's fields as 0 and only initialize the
non-zero fields in ipt_init_target.

v1->v2:
  As Wang Cong's suggestion, fix it by setting all it's fields as
  0 and only initializing the non-zero fields.
