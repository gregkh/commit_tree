asm-generic/bug.h: declare struct pt_regs; before function prototype

This series of patches splits BUILD_BUG related macros out of
"include/linux/bug.h" into new file "include/linux/build_bug.h" (patch
5), and changes the pointer type checking in the `container_of()` macro
to deal with pointers of array type better (patch 6).  Patches 1 to 4
are prerequisites.

Patches 2, 3, 4, and 5 have been inserted since the previous version of
this patch series.  Patch 6 here corresponds to v3 and v4's patch 2.

Patch 1 was a prerequisite in v3 of this series to avoid a lot of
warnings when <linux/bug.h> was included by <linux/kernel.h>.  That is
no longer relevant for v5 of the series, but I left it in because it was
acked by a Arnd Bergmann and Michal Nazarewicz.

Patches 2, 3, and 4 are some checkpatch clean-ups on
"include/linux/bug.h" before splitting out the BUILD_BUG stuff in patch
5.

Patch 5 splits the BUILD_BUG related macros out of "include/linux/bug.h"
into new file "include/linux/build_bug.h" because including
<linux/bug.h> in "include/linux/kernel.h" would result in build failures
due to circular dependencies.

Patch 6 changes the pointer type checking by `container_of()` to avoid
some incompatible pointer warnings when the dereferenced pointer has
array type.

1) asm-generic/bug.h: declare struct pt_regs; before function prototype
2) linux/bug.h: correct formatting of block comment
3) linux/bug.h: correct "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
4) linux/bug.h: correct "space required before that '-'"
5) bug: split BUILD_BUG stuff out into <linux/build_bug.h>
6) kernel.h: handle pointers to arrays better in container_of()

This patch (of 6):

The declaration of `__warn()` has `struct pt_regs *regs` as one of its
parameters.  This can result in compiler warnings if `struct regs` is not
already declared.  Add an empty declaration of `struct pt_regs` to avoid
the warnings.
