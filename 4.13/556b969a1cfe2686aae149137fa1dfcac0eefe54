PM/hibernate: touch NMI watchdog when creating snapshot

There is a problem that when counting the pages for creating the
hibernation snapshot will take significant amount of time, especially on
system with large memory.  Since the counting job is performed with irq
disabled, this might lead to NMI lockup.  The following warning were
found on a system with 1.5TB DRAM:

  Freezing user space processes ... (elapsed 0.002 seconds) done.
  OOM killer disabled.
  PM: Preallocating image memory...

It has taken nearly 20 seconds(2.10GHz CPU) thus the NMI lockup was
triggered.  In case the timeout of the NMI watch dog has been set to 1
second, a safe interval should be 6590003/20 = 320k pages in theory.
However there might also be some platforms running at a lower frequency,
so feed the watchdog every 100k pages.
