mm: remove return value from init_currently_empty_zone

Patch series "mm: make movable onlining suck less", v4.

Movable onlining is a real hack with many downsides - mainly
reintroduction of lowmem/highmem issues we used to have on 32b systems -
but it is the only way to make the memory hotremove more reliable which
is something that people are asking for.

The current semantic of memory movable onlinening is really cumbersome,
however.  The main reason for this is that the udev driven approach is
basically unusable because udev races with the memory probing while only
the last memory block or the one adjacent to the existing zone_movable
are allowed to be onlined movable.  In short the criterion for the
successful online_movable changes under udev's feet.  A reliable udev
approach would require a 2 phase approach where the first successful
movable online would have to check all the previous blocks and online
them in descending order.  This is hard to be considered sane.

This patchset aims at making the onlining semantic more usable.  First
of all it allows to online memory movable as long as it doesn't clash
with the existing ZONE_NORMAL.  That means that ZONE_NORMAL and
ZONE_MOVABLE cannot overlap.  Currently I preserve the original ordering
semantic so the zone always precedes the movable zone but I have plans
to remove this restriction in future because it is not really necessary.

First 3 patches are cleanups which should be ready to be merged right
away (unless I have missed something subtle of course).

Patch 4 deals with ZONE_DEVICE dependencies down the __add_pages path.

Patch 5 deals with implicit assumptions of register_one_node on pgdat
initialization.

Patches 6-10 deal with offline holes in the zone for pfn walkers.  I
hope I got all of them right but people familiar with compaction should
double check this.

Patch 11 is the core of the change.  In order to make it easier to
review I have tried it to be as minimalistic as possible and the large
code removal is moved to patch 14.

Patch 12 is a trivial follow up cleanup.  Patch 13 fixes sparse warnings
and finally patch 14 removes the unused code.

I have tested the patches in kvm:
  # qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -monitor pty -m 2G,slots=4,maxmem=4G -numa node,mem=1G -numa node,mem=1G ...

and then probed the additional memory by
  (qemu) object_add memory-backend-ram,id=mem1,size=1G
  (qemu) device_add pc-dimm,id=dimm1,memdev=mem1

Then I have used this simple script to probe the memory block by hand
  # cat probe_memblock.sh
  #!/bin/sh

  BLOCK_NR=$1

  # echo $((0x100000000+$BLOCK_NR*(128<<20))) > /sys/devices/system/memory/probe

  # for i in $(seq 10); do sh probe_memblock.sh $i; done
  # grep . /sys/devices/system/memory/memory3?/valid_zones 2>/dev/null
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory33/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory35/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory36/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory37/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory38/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory39/valid_zones:Normal Movable

The main difference to the original implementation is that all new
memblocks can be both online_kernel and online_movable initially because
there is no clash obviously.  For the comparison the original
implementation would have

  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory33/valid_zones:Normal
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/valid_zones:Normal
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory35/valid_zones:Normal
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory36/valid_zones:Normal
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory37/valid_zones:Normal
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory38/valid_zones:Normal
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory39/valid_zones:Normal Movable

Now
  # echo online_movable > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/state
  # grep . /sys/devices/system/memory/memory3?/valid_zones 2>/dev/null
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory33/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/valid_zones:Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory35/valid_zones:Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory36/valid_zones:Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory37/valid_zones:Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory38/valid_zones:Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory39/valid_zones:Movable

Block 33 can still be online both kernel and movable while all
the remaining can be only movable.

/proc/zonelist says
  Node 0, zone   Normal
    pages free     0
          min      0
          low      0
          high     0
          spanned  0
          present  0
  --
  Node 0, zone  Movable
    pages free     32753
          min      85
          low      117
          high     149
          spanned  32768
          present  32768

A new memblock at a lower address will result in a new memblock (32)
which will still allow both Normal and Movable.

  # sh probe_memblock.sh 0
  # grep . /sys/devices/system/memory/memory3[2-5]/valid_zones 2>/dev/null
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory32/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory33/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/valid_zones:Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory35/valid_zones:Movable

and online_kernel will convert it to the zone normal properly
while 33 can be still onlined both ways.

  # echo online_kernel > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory32/state
  # grep . /sys/devices/system/memory/memory3[2-5]/valid_zones 2>/dev/null
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory32/valid_zones:Normal
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory33/valid_zones:Normal Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/valid_zones:Movable
  /sys/devices/system/memory/memory35/valid_zones:Movable

/proc/zoneinfo will now tell
  Node 0, zone   Normal
    pages free     65441
          min      165
          low      230
          high     295
          spanned  65536
          present  65536
  --
  Node 0, zone  Movable
    pages free     32740
          min      82
          low      114
          high     146
          spanned  32768
          present  32768

so both zones have one memblock spanned and present.

Onlining 39 should associate this block to the movable zone

  # echo online > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory39/state

/proc/zoneinfo will now tell
  Node 0, zone   Normal
    pages free     32765
          min      80
          low      112
          high     144
          spanned  32768
          present  32768
  --
  Node 0, zone  Movable
    pages free     65501
          min      160
          low      225
          high     290
          spanned  196608
          present  65536

so we will have a movable zone which spans 6 memblocks, 2 present and 4
representing a hole.

Offlining both movable blocks will lead to the zone with no present
pages which is the expected behavior I believe.

  # echo offline > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory39/state
  # echo offline > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/state
  # grep -A6 "Movable\|Normal" /proc/zoneinfo
  Node 0, zone   Normal
    pages free     32735
          min      90
          low      122
          high     154
          spanned  32768
          present  32768
  --
  Node 0, zone  Movable
    pages free     0
          min      0
          low      0
          high     0
          spanned  196608
          present  0

As a bonus we will get a nice cleanup in the memory hotplug codebase.

This patch (of 16):

init_currently_empty_zone doesn't have any error to return yet it is
still an int and callers try to be defensive and try to handle potential
error.  Remove this nonsense and simplify all callers.

This patch shouldn't have any visible effect
