mtd: nand: denali: propagate page to helpers via function argument

This driver stores the currently addressed page into denali->page,
which is later read out by helper functions.  While I am tackling on
this driver, I often missed to insert "denali->page = page;" where
needed.  This makes page_read/write callbacks to get access to a
wrong page, which is a bug hard to figure out.

Instead, I'd rather pass the page via function argument because the
compiler's prototype checks will help to detect bugs.

For the same reason, propagate dma_addr to the DMA helpers instead
of denali->buf.dma_buf .
