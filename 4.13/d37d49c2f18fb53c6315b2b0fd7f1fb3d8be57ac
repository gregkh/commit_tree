wireless: Only join DFS channels in mesh mode if userspace flags support

When joining a mesh network it is not guaranteed that userspace has a
daemon listening for radar events. This is however required for channels
requiring DFS. To flag that userspace will handle radar events, it needs
to set NL80211_ATTR_HANDLE_DFS.

This matches the current mechanism used for IBSS mode.
