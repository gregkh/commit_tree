tty: add function to convert device name to number

The function converts strings like ttyS0 and ttyUSB0 to dev_t like
(4, 64) and (188, 0). It does this by scanning tty_drivers list for
corresponding device name and index. If the driver is not registered,
this function returns -ENODEV. It also acquires tty_mutex.
