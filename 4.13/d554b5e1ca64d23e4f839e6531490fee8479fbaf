nvme: Quirks for PM1725 controllers

PM1725 controllers have a couple of quirks that need to be handled in
the driver:

 - I/O queue depth must be limited to 64 entries on controllers that do
   not report MQES.

 - The host interface registers go offline briefly while resetting the
   chip. Thus a delay is needed before checking whether the controller
   is ready.

Note that the admin queue depth is also limited to 64 on older versions
of this board. Since our NVME_AQ_DEPTH is now 32 that is no longer an
issue.
