drm/i915: Remove unused members from intel_tv.c

They have been unused since 2010, after the code for
intel_tv_save/restore was removed in the below commit:

    drm/i915: Remove dead KMS encoder save/restore code.

    This was brought over from UMS, and used for a while until we decided
    that drm_helper_resume_force_mode was easier and more reliable, since
    it didn't require duplicating all the code deleted here.  We just
    forgot to delete all that junk for a while.
