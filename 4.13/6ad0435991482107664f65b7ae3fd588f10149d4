iwlwifi: mvm: don't warn in queue sync on RF-kill

If we happen to be in or get into the queue sync when RF-kill
is asserted, we return from there and warn since there are
still queue sync notifications outstanding. These can't ever
come though, because we're in RF-kill, so don't WARN then.

While at it, also move the warning to the appropriate place,
if the request is not synchronous then we shouldn't warn, but
currently always will.

To make it fast, also trigger the waitq when on rfkill assert.
