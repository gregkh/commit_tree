mm, gup: remove broken VM_BUG_ON_PAGE compound check for hugepages

When operating on hugepages with DEBUG_VM enabled, the GUP code checks
the compound head for each tail page prior to calling
page_cache_add_speculative.  This is broken, because on the fast-GUP
path (where we don't hold any page table locks) we can be racing with a
concurrent invocation of split_huge_page_to_list.

split_huge_page_to_list deals with this race by using page_ref_freeze to
freeze the page and force concurrent GUPs to fail whilst the component
pages are modified.  This modification includes clearing the
compound_head field for the tail pages, so checking this prior to a
successful call to page_cache_add_speculative can lead to false
positives: In fact, page_cache_add_speculative *already* has this check
once the page refcount has been successfully updated, so we can simply
remove the broken calls to VM_BUG_ON_PAGE.
