dma-buf: avoid scheduling on fence status query v2

When a timeout of zero is specified, the caller is only interested in
the fence status.

In the current implementation, dma_fence_default_wait will always call
schedule_timeout() at least once for an unsignaled fence. This adds a
significant overhead to a fence status query.

Avoid this overhead by returning early if a zero timeout is specified.

v2: move early return after enable_signaling
