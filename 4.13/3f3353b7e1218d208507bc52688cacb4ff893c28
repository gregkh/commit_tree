drm/dp: Introduce MST topology state to track available link bandwidth

Link bandwidth is shared between multiple display streams in DP MST
configurations. The DP MST topology manager structure maintains the
shared link bandwidth for a primary link directly connected to the GPU. For
atomic modesetting drivers, checking if there is sufficient link bandwidth
for a mode needs to be done during the atomic_check phase to avoid failed
modesets. Let's encapsulate the available link bw information in a
private state structure so that bw can be allocated and released atomically
for each of the ports sharing the primary link.

v3: WARN_ON() if connection_mutex is not held (Archit)
v2: Included kernel doc, moved state initialization and switched to
kmemdup() for allocation (Daniel)
