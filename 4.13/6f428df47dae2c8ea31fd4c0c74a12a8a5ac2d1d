libceph: pg_upmap[_items] infrastructure

pg_temp and pg_upmap encodings are the same (PG -> array of osds),
except for the incremental remove: it's an empty mapping in new_pg_temp
for pg_temp and a separate old_pg_upmap set for pg_upmap.  (This isn't
to allow for empty pg_upmap mappings -- apparently, pg_temp just wasn't
looked at as an example for pg_upmap encoding.)

Reuse __decode_pg_temp() for decoding pg_upmap and new_pg_upmap.
__decode_pg_temp() stores into pg_temp union member, but since pg_upmap
union member is identical, reading through pg_upmap later is OK.
