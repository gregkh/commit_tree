scsi: fnic: changing queue command to return result DID_IMM_RETRY when rport is init

Currently the queue command returns DID_NO_CONNECT anytime the rport is
not in RPORT_ST_READY state. Changing it to return DID_NO_CONNECT only
when the rport is in RPORT_ST_DELETE state. When the rport is in one of
the init states retruning DID_IMM_RETRY.
