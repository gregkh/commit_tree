block: remove bio_clone() and all references.

bio_clone() is no longer used.
Only bio_clone_bioset() or bio_clone_fast().
This is for the best, as bio_clone() used fs_bio_set,
and filesystems are unlikely to want to use bio_clone().

So remove bio_clone() and all references.
This includes a fix to some incorrect documentation.
