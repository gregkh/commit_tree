mm: per-cgroup memory reclaim stats

Track the following reclaim counters for every memory cgroup: PGREFILL,
PGSCAN, PGSTEAL, PGACTIVATE, PGDEACTIVATE, PGLAZYFREE and PGLAZYFREED.

These values are exposed using the memory.stats interface of cgroup v2.

The meaning of each value is the same as for global counters, available
using /proc/vmstat.

Also, for consistency, rename mem_cgroup_count_vm_event() to
count_memcg_event_mm().
