ASoC: audio-graph-scu-card: tidyup asoc_simple_card_canonicalize_cpu() parameter

asoc_simple_card_canonicalize_cpu() 2nd param is asking CPU component's
DAI links, not Card links.
This patch fixup it. Otherwise, audio-graph-card can't handle CPU
component correctly if CPU has mult-DAIs and Card uses only one of them
