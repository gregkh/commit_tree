test_sysctl: add dedicated proc sysctl test driver

The existing tools/testing/selftests/sysctl/ tests include two test
cases, but these use existing production kernel sysctl interfaces.  We
want to expand test coverage but we can't just be looking for random
safe production values to poke at, that's just insane!

Instead just dedicate a test driver for debugging purposes and port the
existing scripts to use it.  This will make it easier for further tests
to be added.

Subsequent patches will extend our test coverage for sysctl.

The stress test driver uses a new license (GPL on Linux, copyleft-next
outside of Linux).  Linus was fine with this [0] and later due to Ted's
and Alans's request ironed out an "or" language clause to use [1] which
is already present upstream.
