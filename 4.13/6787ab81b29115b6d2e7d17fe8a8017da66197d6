iscsi: ensure RNG is seeded before use

It's not safe to use weak random data here, especially for the challenge
response randomness. Since we're always in process context, it's safe to
simply wait until we have enough randomness to carry out the
authentication correctly.

While we're at it, we clean up a small memleak during an error
condition.
