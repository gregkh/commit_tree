arm64: defconfig: enable Qualcomm Technologies EMAC and some PHY drivers

The EMAC is present on Qualcomm Technologies' server and some mobile
chips, and is used as the primary Ethernet interface.

Systems that have these SOCs typically have an Atheros 803x or
Marvell 88e1111 PHY in them, so enable those drivers too.
