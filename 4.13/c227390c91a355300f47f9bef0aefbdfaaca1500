jfs should use MAX_LFS_FILESIZE when calculating s_maxbytes

jfs had previously avoided the use of MAX_LFS_FILESIZE because it hadn't
accounted for the whole 32-bit index range on 32-bit systems.  That has
been fixed by commit 0cc3b0ec23ce ("Clarify (and fix) MAX_LFS_FILESIZE
macros"), so we can simplify the code now.
