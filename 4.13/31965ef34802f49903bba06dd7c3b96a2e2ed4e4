xfs: make errortag a per-mountpoint structure

Remove the xfs_etest structure in favor of a per-mountpoint structure.
This will give us the flexibility to set as many error injection points
as we want, and later enable us to set up sysfs knobs to set the trigger
frequency as we wish.  This comes at a cost of higher memory use, but
unti we hit 1024 injection points (we're at 29) or a lot of mounts this
shouldn't be a huge issue.
