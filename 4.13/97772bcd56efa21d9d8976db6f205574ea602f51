netfilter: nat: fix src map lookup

When doing initial conversion to rhashtable I replaced the bucket
walk with a single rhashtable_lookup_fast().

When moving to rhlist I failed to properly walk the list of identical
tuples, but that is what is needed for this to work correctly.
The table contains the original tuples, so the reply tuples are all
distinct.

We currently decide that mapping is (not) in range only based on the
first entry, but in case its not we need to try the reply tuple of the
next entry until we either find an in-range mapping or we checked
all the entries.

This bug makes nat core attempt collision resolution while it might be
able to use the mapping as-is.
