ARM: davinci: da8xx: Add DSP internal RAM memories as IOMEM resources

The DSP subsystem on DA8xx has various internal RAM memories that can
accessed from the ARM side. These memories can be configured to be
used as either RAM or Cache. Add these memories as IOMEM resources
to the DSP device so that the driver can support loading of images
into internal memories.
