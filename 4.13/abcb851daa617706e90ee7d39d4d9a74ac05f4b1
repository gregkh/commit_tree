KVM: arm/arm64: Check if irq lines to the GIC are already used

We check if other in-kernel devices have already been connected to the
GIC for a particular interrupt line when possible.

For the PMU, we can do this whenever setting the PMU interrupt number
from userspace.

For the timers, we have to wait until we try to enable the timer,
because we have a concept of default IRQ numbers that userspace
shouldn't have to work around in the initialization phase.
