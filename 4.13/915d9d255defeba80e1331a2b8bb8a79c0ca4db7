ima: Log the same audit cause whenever a file has no signature

If the file doesn't have an xattr, ima_appraise_measurement sets cause to
"missing-hash" while if there's an xattr but it's a digest instead of a
signature it sets cause to "IMA-signature-required".

Fix it by setting cause to "IMA-signature-required" in both cases.
