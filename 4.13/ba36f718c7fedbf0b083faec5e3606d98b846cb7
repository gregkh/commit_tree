qed: Diffrentiate adapter-specific attentions

There are 4 attention bits in AEU that have different meaning
for QL45xxx and QL41xxx adapters.

Instead of doing a massive infrastructure change in favor of these
bits, we implement a point fix where only those four would change
meaning dependent on the adapter involved.
