udp: avoid a cache miss on dequeue

Since UDP no more uses sk->destructor, we can clear completely
the skb head state before enqueuing. Amend and use
skb_release_head_state() for that.

All head states share a single cacheline, which is not
normally used/accesses on dequeue. We can avoid entirely accessing
such cacheline implementing and using in the UDP code a specialized
skb free helper which ignores the skb head state.

This saves a cacheline miss at skb deallocation time.

v1 -> v2:
  replaced secpath_reset() with skb_release_head_state()
