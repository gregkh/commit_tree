cpufreq: intel_pstate: Clean up after performance governor changes

After commit 82b4e03e01bc (intel_pstate: skip scheduler hook when in
"performance" mode) get_target_pstate_use_performance() and
get_target_pstate_use_cpu_load() are never called if scaling_governor
is "performance", so drop the CPUFREQ_POLICY_PERFORMANCE checks from
them as they will never trigger anyway.

Moreover, the documentation needs to be updated to reflect the change
made by the above commit, so do that too.
