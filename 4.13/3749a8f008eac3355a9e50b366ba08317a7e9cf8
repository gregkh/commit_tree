mm: zero hash tables in allocator

Add a new flag HASH_ZERO which when provided grantees that the hash
table that is returned by alloc_large_system_hash() is zeroed.  In most
cases that is what is needed by the caller.  Use page level allocator's
__GFP_ZERO flags to zero the memory.  It is using memset() which is
efficient method to zero memory and is optimized for most platforms.
