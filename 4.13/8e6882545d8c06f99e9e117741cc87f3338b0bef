scsi: Avoid that scsi_exit_rq() triggers a use-after-free

Dereferencing shost from scsi_exit_rq() is not safe because the SCSI
host may already have been freed when scsi_exit_rq() is called.
Increasing the shost reference count in scsi_init_rq() and dropping that
reference in scsi_exit_rq() is nontrivial since scsi_host_dev_release()
may sleep and since scsi_exit_rq() may be called from interrupt
context. Since scsi_exit_rq() only needs a single bit from shost, copy
that bit into struct scsi_cmnd.
