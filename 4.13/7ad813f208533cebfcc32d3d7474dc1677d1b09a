net: phy: Correctly process PHY_HALTED in phy_stop_machine()

Marc reported that he was not getting the PHY library adjust_link()
callback function to run when calling phy_stop() + phy_disconnect()
which does not indeed happen because we set the state machine to
PHY_HALTED but we don't get to run it to process this state past that
point.

Fix this with a synchronous call to phy_state_machine() in order to have
the state machine actually act on PHY_HALTED, set the PHY device's link
down, turn the network device's carrier off and finally call the
adjust_link() function.
