netfilter: nf_tables: Fix nft limit burst handling

Current implementation treats the burst configuration the same as
rate configuration. This can cause the per packet cost to be lower
than configured. In effect, this bug causes the token bucket to be
refilled at a higher rate than what user has specified.

This patch changes the implementation so that the token bucket size
is controlled by "rate + burst", while maintain the token bucket
refill rate the same as user specified.
