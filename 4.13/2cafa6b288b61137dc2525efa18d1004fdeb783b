[media] dvb-frontends/stv0367: add defaults for use w/DD-branded devices

Digital Devices uses defaults tables in their stv0367dd demod driver
variant which differ in a few registers, at least enough that no stable
operation can be provided with the tables already present in the driver
(init succeeds and DVB reception works but at least when the driver is
reloaded using rmmod/modprobe, the demod goes into a crashed state in a
way it doesn't react on any I2C command anymore, while even more
side-effects may occur), so there's a good reason to better have another
set of defaults.

Defaults originating from the stv0367dd driver. Permission to reuse them
was formally granted by Ralph Metzler <rjkm@metzlerbros.de>.
