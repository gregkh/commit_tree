PNP / ACPI: add support for GpioInt resource type

The PNP ACPI driver parses ACPI interrupt resource but not
GpioInt resource. When the firmware passes GpioInt resource
for IRQ the PNP ACPI driver ignores it and hence the interrupt for
the particular driver will not work.
One such example is 8042 keyboard which uses PNP driver for obtaining
the interrupt resource. On Intel Braswell project GpioInt is used
instead of interrupt resource and the keyboard driver fails to
register interrupt.
Fix the issue by parsing GpioInt resource type.
