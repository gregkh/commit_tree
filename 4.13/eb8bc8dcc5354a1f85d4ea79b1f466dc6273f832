    drm/i915: Disable all crtcs during driver unload, v2.

made sure that all crtc's are disabled on driver unload, but only the
following commit made sure all fb's are cleaned up correctly:

    drm/atomic: Make disable_all helper fully disable the crtc.

Finally remove this and add a WARN_ON when vma is set. It should
have been removed by intel_cleanup_plane_fb().
