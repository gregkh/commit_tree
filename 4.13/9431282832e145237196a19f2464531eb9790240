drm/i915: Mark up clflushes as belonging to an unordered timeline

2 clflushes on two different objects are not ordered, and so do not
belong to the same timeline (context). Either we use a unique context
for each, or we reserve a special global context to mean unordered.
Ideally, we would reserve 0 to mean unordered (DMA_FENCE_NO_CONTEXT) to
have the same semantics everywhere.
