drm/i915: Clean up the LPE audio platform data

Split the LPE audio platform data into a port specific
chunk and device specific chunk. Eventually we'll have
a port specific chunk for each port, but for now we'll
stick to just one.

We'll also get rid of the intel_hdmi_lpe_audio_eld structure
which doesn't seem to have any real reason to exist.

v2: Organize per port instead of per pipe
