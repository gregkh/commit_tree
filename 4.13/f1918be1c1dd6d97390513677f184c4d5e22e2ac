HID: ite: Add hid-ite driver

The ITE8595 keyboard uses the HID_GD_RFKILL_BTN usage code
from the Wireless Radio Controls Application Collection Microsoft
has defined for Windows 8 and later.

However it has a quirk, when the rfkill hotkey is pressed it does
generate a report for the collection, but the reported value is
always 0. Luckily it is the only button in this collection / report,
and it sends a report on release only, so receiving a report means the
button was pressed.

This commit adds a hid-ite driver which watches for the Wireless Radio
Controls Application Collection report and then reports a KEY_RFKILL event,
ignoring the value, making the rfkill on this keyboard work.
