bpf: add bpf_skb_adjust_room helper

This work adds a helper that can be used to adjust net room of an
skb. The helper is generic and can be further extended in future.
Main use case is for having a programmatic way to add/remove room to
v4/v6 header options along with cls_bpf on egress and ingress hook
of the data path. It reuses most of the infrastructure that we added
for the bpf_skb_change_type() helper which can be used in nat64
translations. Similarly, the helper only takes care of adjusting the
room so that related data is populated and csum adapted out of the
BPF program using it.
