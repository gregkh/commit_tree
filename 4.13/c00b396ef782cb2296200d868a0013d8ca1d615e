libnvdimm, pmem: fix persistence warning

The pmem driver assumes if platform firmware describes the memory
devices associated with a persistent memory range and
CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PMEM_API=y that it has all the mechanism necessary to
flush data to a power-fail safe zone. We warn if the firmware does not
describe memory devices, but we also need to warn if the architecture
does not claim pmem support.
