ioc3-eth: store pointer to net_device for priviate area

Computing the alignment manually for going from priv to pub is probably
not such a good idea, and in general the assumption that going from priv
to pub is possible trivially could change, so rather than relying on
that, we change things to just store a pointer to pub. This was sugested
by DaveM in [1].
