ARM: dts: uniphier: use SPDX-License-Identifier

Follow the recent trend for the license description, and fix the wrongly
stated X11 to MIT.

The X11 license text [1] is explicitly for the X Consortium and has a
couple of extra clauses.  The MIT license text [2] is actually what the
current DT files claim.
