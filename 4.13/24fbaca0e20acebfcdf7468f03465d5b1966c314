drm: omapdrm: Fix incorrect usage of the term 'cache coherency'

The is_cache_coherent() function currently returns true when the mapping
is not cache-coherent. This isn't a bug as such as the callers interpret
cache-coherent as meaning that the driver has to handle the coherency
manually, but it is nonetheless very confusing. Fix it and add a bit
more documentation to explain how cached buffers are handled.
