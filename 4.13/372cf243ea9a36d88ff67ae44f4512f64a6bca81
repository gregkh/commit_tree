block: convert to errseq_t based writeback error tracking

This is a very minimal conversion to errseq_t based error tracking
for raw block device access. Just have it use the standard
file_write_and_wait_range call.

Note that there are internal callers that call sync_blockdev
and the like that are not affected by this. They'll continue
to use the AS_EIO/AS_ENOSPC flags for error reporting like
they always have for now.
