x86/boot: Remove unused copy_*_gs() functions

copy_from_gs() and copy_to_gs() are unused in the boot code. They have
actually never been used -- they were always commented out since their
addition in 2007:

  5be865661516 ("String-handling functions for the new x86 setup code.")

So remove them -- they can be restored from history if needed.
