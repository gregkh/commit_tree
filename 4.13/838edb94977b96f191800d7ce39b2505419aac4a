NFSv4.1: Use seqid returned by EXCHANGE_ID after state migration

Transparent State Migration copies a client's lease state from the
server where a filesystem used to reside to the server where it now
resides. When an NFSv4.1 client first contacts that destination
server, it uses EXCHANGE_ID to detect trunking relationships.

The lease that was copied there is returned to that client, but the
destination server sets EXCHGID4_FLAG_CONFIRMED_R when replying to
the client. This is because the lease was confirmed on the source
server (before it was copied).

When CONFIRMED_R is set, the client throws away the sequence ID
returned by the server. During a Transparent State Migration, however
there's no other way for the client to know what sequence ID to use
with a lease that's been migrated.

Therefore, the client must save and use the contrived slot sequence
value returned by the destination server even when CONFIRMED_R is
set.

Note that some servers always return a seqid of 1 after a migration.
