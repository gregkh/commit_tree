power: supply: bq27xxx: Add power_supply_battery_info support

Previously there was no way to configure these chips in the event that the
defaults didn't match the battery in question.

For chips with RAM data memory (and also those with flash/NVM data memory
if CONFIG_BATTERY_BQ27XXX_DT_UPDATES_NVM is defined and the user has not
set module param dt_monitored_battery_updates_nvm=0) we now call
power_supply_get_battery_info(), check its values, and write battery
properties to chip data memory if there is a dm_regs table for the chip.
