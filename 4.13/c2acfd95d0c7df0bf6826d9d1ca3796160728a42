libceph: set -EINVAL in one place in crush_decode()

No sooner than Dan had fixed this issue in commit 293dffaad8d5
("libceph: NULL deref on crush_decode() error path"), I brought it
back.  Add a new label and set -EINVAL once, right before failing.

Fixes: 278b1d709c6a ("libceph: ceph_decode_skip_* helpers")
