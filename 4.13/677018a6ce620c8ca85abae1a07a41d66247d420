afs: Implement show_options

Implement the show_options superblock op for afs as part of a bid to get
rid of s_options and generic_show_options() to make it easier to implement
a context-based mount where the mount options can be passed individually
over a file descriptor.

Also implement the show_devname op to display the correct device name and thus
avoid the need to display the cell= and volume= options.
