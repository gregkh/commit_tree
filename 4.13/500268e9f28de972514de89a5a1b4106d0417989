net: thunderx: Fix BGX transmit stall due to underflow

For SGMII/RGMII/QSGMII interfaces when physical link goes down
while traffic is high is resulting in underflow condition being set
on that specific BGX's LMAC. Which assets a backpresure and VNIC stops
transmitting packets.

This is due to BGX being disabled in link status change callback while
packet is in transit. This patch fixes this issue by not disabling BGX
but instead just disables packet Rx and Tx.
