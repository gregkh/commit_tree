mux: gpio: add mux controller driver for gpio based multiplexers

The driver builds a single multiplexer controller using a number
of gpio pins. For N pins, there will be 2^N possible multiplexer
states. The GPIO pins can be connected (by the hardware) to several
multiplexers, which in that case will be operated in parallel.
