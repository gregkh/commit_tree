drm/i915: The shrinker already acquires struct_mutex, so call it unlocked

The shrinker is prepared to be called unlocked (and at other times with
struct_mutex held for DIRECT_RECLAIM) so we can skip acquiring the
struct_mutex prior to calling the shrinker during freeze. This improves
our ability to shrink as we can be more aggressive when we know the
caller isn't holding struct_mutex.
