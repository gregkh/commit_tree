MIPS: Send SIGILL for BPOSGE32 in `__compute_return_epc_for_insn'

Fix commit e50c0a8fa60d ("Support the MIPS32 / MIPS64 DSP ASE.") and
send SIGILL rather than SIGBUS whenever an unimplemented BPOSGE32 DSP
ASE instruction has been encountered in `__compute_return_epc_for_insn'
as our Reserved Instruction exception handler would in response to an
attempt to actually execute the instruction.  Sending SIGBUS only makes
sense for the unaligned PC case, since moved to `__compute_return_epc'.
Adjust function documentation accordingly, correct formatting and use
`pr_info' rather than `printk' as the other exit path already does.
