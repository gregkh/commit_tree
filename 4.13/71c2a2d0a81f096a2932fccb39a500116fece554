x86/hyperv: Read TSC frequency from a synthetic MSR

It was found that SMI_TRESHOLD of 50000 is not enough for Hyper-V
guests in nested environment and falling back to counting jiffies
is not an option for Gen2 guests as they don't have PIT. As Hyper-V
provides TSC frequency in a synthetic MSR we can just use this information
instead of doing a error prone calibration.
