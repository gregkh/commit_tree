iio: adc: cpcap: Fix die temperature

It seems that "MC13783 Power Management and Audio Ciruit User's Guide"
MC1378UG.pdf documents several similar components as in the CPCAP PMIC.

Chapter "9.5.5 Die Temperature and UID" says that the die temperature
value is 282 at 25C with LSB of -1.14C. Converting CPCAP PMIC channel3
values with following seems to produce values that make sense for a
PMIC die:

temperature = 25000 + ((regval - 282) * 114)

As we don't have any other documentation, let's assume the die
temperature is unconfigured in the Motorola mapphone Linux kernel
and the current temperature conversion table should be only used
for the battery thermistor and not for the die temperature.
