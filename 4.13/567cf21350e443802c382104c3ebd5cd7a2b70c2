ARM: dts: Qualcomm APQ8060 DragonBoard ALS sensor

This adds the Capella CM3605 ambient light and proximity sensor
to the APQ8060 DragonBoard device tree. Notice that we also set
up pin config for the AOUT line and GPIO lines, and that we set
the default trigger on the infrared LED to associate with the
"cm3605" trigger so the IR LED is controlled by this the CM3605
driver.
