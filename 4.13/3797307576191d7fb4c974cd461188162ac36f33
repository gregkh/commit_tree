perf intel-pt: Synthesize new power and "ptwrite" events

Synthesize new power and ptwrite events.

Power events report changes to C-state but I have also added support
for the existing CBR (core-to-bus ratio) packet and included that
when outputting power events.

The PTWRITE packet is associated with the new "ptwrite" instruction,
which is essentially just a way to stuff a 32 or 64 bit value into the
PT trace.

More details can be found in the patches that add documentation and in
the Intel SDM.
