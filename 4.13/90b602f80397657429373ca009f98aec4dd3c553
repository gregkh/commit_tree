net: add function to retrieve original skb device using NAPI ID

Since commit b68581778cd0 ("net: Make skb->skb_iif always track
skb->dev") skbs don't have the original index of the interface which
received the packet. This information is now needed for a new control
message related to hardware timestamping.

Instead of adding a new field to skb, we can find the device by the NAPI
ID if it is available, i.e. CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL is enabled and the
driver is using NAPI. Add dev_get_by_napi_id() and also skb_napi_id() to
hide the CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL ifdef.
