media: lirc: LIRC_GET_REC_RESOLUTION should return microseconds

Since commit e8f4818895b3 ("[media] lirc: advertise
LIRC_CAN_GET_REC_RESOLUTION and improve") lircd uses the ioctl
LIRC_GET_REC_RESOLUTION to determine the shortest pulse or space that
the hardware can detect. This breaks decoding in lirc because lircd
expects the answer in microseconds, but nanoseconds is returned.
