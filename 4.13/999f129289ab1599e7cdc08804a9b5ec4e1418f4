net: ethernet: ti: cpts: convert to use ptp auxiliary worker

There could be significant delay in CPTS work schedule under high system
load and on -RT which could cause CPTS misbehavior due to internal counter
overflow. Usage of own kthread_worker allows to avoid such kind of issues
and makes it possible to tune priority of CPTS kthread_worker thread on -RT
(thread name "cpts").

Hence, the CPTS driver is converted to use PTP auxiliary worker as PHC
subsystem implements such functionality in a generic way now.
