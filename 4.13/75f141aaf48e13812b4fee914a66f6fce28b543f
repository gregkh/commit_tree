target/tcm_loop: Use target_submit_tmr() instead of open-coding this function

Use target_submit_tmr() instead of open-coding this function. The
only functional change is that TMFs are now added to sess_cmd_list,
something the current code does not do. This behavior change is a
bug fix because it makes LUN RESETs wait for other TMFs that are in
progress for the same LUN.
