qed: Hold a single array for SBs

A PF today holds 2 different arrays - one holding information
about the HW configuration and one holding information about
the SBs that are used by the protocol drivers.
These arrays aren't really connected - e.g., protocol driver
initializing a given SB would not mark the same SB as occupied
in the HW shadow array.

Move into a single array [at least for PFs] - hold the mapping
of the driver-protocol SBs on the HW entry which they configure.
