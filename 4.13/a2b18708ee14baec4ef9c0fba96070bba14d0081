Revert "android: binder: Sanity check at binder ioctl"

This reverts commit a906d6931f3ccaf7de805643190765ddd7378e27.

The patch introduced a race in the binder driver. An attempt to fix the
race was submitted in "[PATCH v2] android: binder: fix dangling pointer
comparison", however the conclusion in the discussion for that patch
was that the original patch should be reverted.

The reversion is being done as part of the fine-grained locking
patchset since the patch would need to be refactored when
proc->vmm_vm_mm is removed from struct binder_proc and added
in the binder allocator.
