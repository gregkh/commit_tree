qed: Add bitmaps for VF CIDs

Each PF has a bitmap for its own ranges of CIDs, to allow easy grabbing
of an available CID when such is needed. But VFs are not using the same
mechanism, instead relying on hard-coded CIDs [ queue-index == cid ].

As an infrastructure step toward increasing number of CIDs of VFs,
the PF is going to maintain bitmaps for the VF CIDs as well -
the bitmaps would be per-VF and the ranges would be the same [in HW all
VFs of a given PF have the same mapping of CIDs, and the HW is capable
of distinguishing between those according to the VF index]
