target/iblock: Convert WRITE_SAME to blkdev_issue_zeroout

The people who are actively using iblock_execute_write_same_direct() are
doing so in the context of ESX VAAI BlockZero, together with
EXTENDED_COPY and COMPARE_AND_WRITE primitives.

In practice though I've not seen any users of IBLOCK WRITE_SAME for
anything other than VAAI BlockZero, so just using blkdev_issue_zeroout()
when available, and falling back to iblock_execute_write_same() if the
WRITE_SAME buffer contains anything other than zeros should be OK.

(Hook up max_write_zeroes_sectors to signal LBPRZ feature bit in
 target_configure_unmap_from_queue - nab)
