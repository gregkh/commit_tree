ACPI / PM: Clean up device wakeup enable/disable code

The wakeup.flags.enabled flag in struct acpi_device is not used
consistently, as there is no reason why it should only apply
to the enabling/disabling of the wakeup GPE, so put the invocation
of acpi_enable_wakeup_device_power() under it too.

Moreover, it is not necessary to call
acpi_enable_wakeup_devices() and acpi_disable_wakeup_devices() for
suspend-to-idle, so don't do that.
