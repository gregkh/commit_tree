posix-timers: Fix inverted SIGEV_NONE logic in common_timer_get()

The refactoring of the posix-timer core to allow better code sharing
introduced inverted logic vs. SIGEV_NONE timers in common_timer_get().

That causes hrtimer_forward() to be called on active timers, which
rightfully triggers the warning hrtimer_forward().

Make sig_none what it says: signal mode == SIGEV_NONE.
