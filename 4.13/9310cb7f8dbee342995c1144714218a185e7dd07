drm/i915: Remove kref from i915_sw_fence

My original intention was for i915_sw_fence to be the base class and
provide the reference count for the container. This was from starting
with a design to handle async_work. In practice, for i915 we embed
fences into structs which have their own independent reference counting,
making the i915_sw_fence.kref duplicitous. If we remove the kref, we
remove the i915_sw_fence's ability to free itself and its independence,
it can only exist within a container and must be supplied with a
callback to handle its release.
