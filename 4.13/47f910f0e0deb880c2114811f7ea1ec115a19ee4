[media] v4l: subdev: tolerate null in media_entity_to_v4l2_subdev

Return NULL, if a null entity is parsed for it's v4l2_subdev

Currently, the callers of media_entity_to_v4l2_subdev() need to
make sure that the subdev is non-NULL, for example, when it is
obtained from media_entity_remote_pad().

As this is a recurring pattern, add the check at the macro in order
to avoid additional checks at the callers.
