i2c: pca-platform: correctly set algo_data.reset_chip

When device tree support was added the setting of algo_data.reset_chip
was moved. There were two problems with this. The first being that
i2c_pca_pf_resetchip was only used if platform data was provided. The
second that it was unconditionally overridden with
i2c_pca_pf_dummyreset. Ensure that however the reset gpio is defined the
correct reset_chip function is used.

Fixes: commit 4cc7229daa46 ("i2c: pca-platform: switch to struct gpio_desc")
