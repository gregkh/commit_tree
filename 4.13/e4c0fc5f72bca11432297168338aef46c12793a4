powerpc/64s: Leave interrupts hard enabled in context switch for radix

Commit 4387e9ff25 ("[POWERPC] Fix PMU + soft interrupt disable bug")
hard disabled interrupts over the low level context switch, because
the SLB management can't cope with a PMU interrupt accesing the stack
in that window.

Radix based kernel mapping does not use the SLB so it does not require
interrupts hard disabled here.

This is worth 1-2% in context switch performance on POWER9.
