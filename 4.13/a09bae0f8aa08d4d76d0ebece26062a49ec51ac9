x86/boot/e820: Rename the e820_table_firmware to e820_table_kexec

Currently the e820_table_firmware[] table is mainly used by the kexec,
and it is not what it's supposed to be - despite its name it might be
modified by the kernel.

So change its name to e820_table_kexec[]. In the next patch we will
introduce the real e820_table_firmware[] table.

No functional change.
