NFC: trf7970a: Only check 'en2-rf-quirk' if EN2 is specified

The quirk indicated by the 'en2-rf-quirk' device tree property
is only relevant when there is a GPIO connected to the EN2 pin
of the trf7970a. This means we should only check for 'en2-rf-quirk'
when EN2 is specified in the 'ti,enable-gpios' property of the
device tree.
