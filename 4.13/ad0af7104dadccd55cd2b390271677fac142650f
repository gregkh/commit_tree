vfs: introduce inode 'inuse' lock

Added an i_state flag I_INUSE and helpers to set/clear/test the bit.

The 'inuse' lock is an 'advisory' inode lock, that can be used to extend
exclusive create protection beyond parent->i_mutex lock among cooperating
users.

This is going to be used by overlayfs to get exclusive ownership on upper
and work dirs among overlayfs mounts.
