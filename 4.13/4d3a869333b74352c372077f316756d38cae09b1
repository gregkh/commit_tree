ALSA: seq: Fix CONFIG_SND_SEQ_MIDI dependency

The commit 0181307abc1d ("ALSA: seq: Reorganize kconfig and build")
rewrote the dependency of each sequencer module in a standard way, but
there was one change applied mistakenly: CONFIG_SND_SEQ_MIDI isn't
enabled properly by CONFIG_SND_RAWMIDI.  I seem to have changed the
wrong one instead, CONFIG_SND_SEQ_MIDI_EMUL, which is eventually
reverse-selected by CONFIG_SND_SEQ_MIDI itself.  This ended up the
lack of snd-seq-midi module as reported below.

The fix is to put def_tristate properly to CONFIG_SND_SEQ_MIDI instead
of *_MIDI_EMUL entry.
