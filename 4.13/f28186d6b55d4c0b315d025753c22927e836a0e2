net/mlx4_en: Improve stack xmit function

Several small code and performance improvements in stack TX datapath,
including:
- Compiler branch predictor hints.
- Minimize variables scope.
- Move tx_info non-inline flow handling to a separate function.
- Calculate data_offset in compile time rather than in runtime
  (for !lso_header_size branch).
- Avoid trinary-operator ("?") when value can be preset in a matching
  branch.

Performance tests:
Tested on ConnectX3Pro, Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz

Gain is too small to be measurable, no degradation sensed.
Results are similar for IPv4 and IPv6.
