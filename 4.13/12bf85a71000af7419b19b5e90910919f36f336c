powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Fix passing of catalog version number

H_GET_24X7_CATALOG_PAGE needs to be passed the version number obtained from
the first catalog page obtained previously. This is a 64 bit number, but
create_events_from_catalog truncates it to 32-bit.

This worked on POWER8, but POWER9 actually uses the upper bits so the call
fails with H_P3 because the hypervisor doesn't recognize the version.

This patch also adds the hcall return code to the error message, which is
helpful when debugging the problem.
