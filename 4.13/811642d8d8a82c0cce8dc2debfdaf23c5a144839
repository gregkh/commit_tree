vfio: Fix group release deadlock

If vfio_iommu_group_notifier() acquires a group reference and that
reference becomes the last reference to the group, then vfio_group_put
introduces a deadlock code path where we're trying to unregister from
the iommu notifier chain from within a callout of that chain.  Use a
work_struct to release this reference asynchronously.
