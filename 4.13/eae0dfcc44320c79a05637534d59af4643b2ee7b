powerpc/fadump: avoid holes in boot memory area when fadump is registered

To register fadump, boot memory area - the size of low memory chunk that
is required for a kernel to boot successfully when booted with restricted
memory, is assumed to have no holes. But this memory area is currently
not protected from hot-remove operations. So, fadump could fail to
re-register after a memory hot-remove operation, if memory is removed
from boot memory area. To avoid this, ensure that memory from boot
memory area is not hot-removed when fadump is registered.
