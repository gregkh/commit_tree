drm: zte: add VGA driver support

It adds VGA driver support, which needs to configure corresponding VOU
interface in RGB_888 format, and thus the following changes are needed
on zx_vou.

 - Rename the CSC block of Graphic Layer a bit to make it more specific,
   and add CSC of Channel to support RGB output.
 - Bypass Dither block for RGB output.
