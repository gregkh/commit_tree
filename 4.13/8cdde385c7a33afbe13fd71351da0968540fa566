mm: Adjust system_state check

To enable smp_processor_id() and might_sleep() debug checks earlier, it's
required to add system states between SYSTEM_BOOTING and SYSTEM_RUNNING.

get_nid_for_pfn() checks for system_state == BOOTING to decide whether to
use early_pfn_to_nid() when CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT=y.

That check is dubious, because the switch to state RUNNING happes way after
page_alloc_init_late() has been invoked.

Change the check to less than RUNNING state so it covers the new
intermediate states as well.
