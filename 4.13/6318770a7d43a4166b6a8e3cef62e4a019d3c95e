filesystem-dax: convert to dax_flush()

Filesystem-DAX flushes caches whenever it writes to the address returned
through dax_direct_access() and when writing back dirty radix entries.
That flushing is only required in the pmem case, so the dax_flush()
helper skips cache management work when the underlying driver does not
specify a flush method.

We still do all the dirty tracking since the radix entry will already be
there for locking purposes. However, the work to clean the entry will be
a nop for some dax drivers.
