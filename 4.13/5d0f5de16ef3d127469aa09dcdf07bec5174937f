drm/i915/gvt: refactor function intel_vgpu_submit_execlist

The function intel_vgpu_submit_execlist could be more simpler. It
actually does:
  1) validate the submission. The first context must be valid,
     and all two must be privilege_access.
  2) submit valid contexts. The first one need emulate schedule_in.

We do not need a bitmap, valid desc copy valid_desc. Local variable
emulate_schedule_in also can be optimized out.

v2: dump desc content in err msg (Zhi Wang)
