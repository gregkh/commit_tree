watchdog: core: add option to avoid early handling of watchdog

On some systems its desirable to have watchdog reboot the system
when it does not come up fast enough. This adds a kernel parameter
to disable the auto-update of watchdog before userspace takes over
and a kernel option to set the default. The info messages were
added to shorten error searching on misconfigured systems.
