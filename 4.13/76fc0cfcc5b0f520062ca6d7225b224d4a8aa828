powerpc/64s: Fix hypercall entry clobbering r12 input

A previous optimisation incorrectly assumed the PAPR hcall does
not use r12, and clobbers it upon entry. In fact it is used as
an input. This can result in KVM guests crashing (observed with
PR KVM).

Instead of using r12 to save r13, tihs patch saves r13 in ctr.
This is more costly, but not as slow as using the SPRG.
