memory: atmel-ebi: Allow t_DF timings of zero ns

As reported in [1] and in [2] it's not possible to set the device tree
property 'atmel,smc-tdf-ns' to zero, although the SoC allows a setting
of 0ns for the t_DF time.

Allow this setting by doing the same thing as in the atmel nand
controller driver by setting ncycles to ATMEL_SMC_MODE_TDF_MIN if zero
is set in the dts.
