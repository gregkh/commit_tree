cgroup: Move debug cgroup to its own file

The debug cgroup currently resides within cgroup-v1.c and is enabled
only for v1 cgroup. To enable the debug cgroup also for v2, it makes
sense to put the code into its own file as it will no longer be v1
specific. There is no change to the debug cgroup specific code.
