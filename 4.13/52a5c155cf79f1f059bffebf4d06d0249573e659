KVM: async_pf: Let guest support delivery of async_pf from guest mode

Adds another flag bit (bit 2) to MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_EN. If bit 2 is 1,
async page faults are delivered to L1 as #PF vmexits; if bit 2 is 0,
kvm_can_do_async_pf returns 0 if in guest mode.

This is similar to what svm.c wanted to do all along, but it is only
enabled for Linux as L1 hypervisor.  Foreign hypervisors must never
receive async page faults as vmexits, because they'd probably be very
confused about that.
