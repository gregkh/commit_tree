ARM: s5pv210_defconfig: Bring back lost (but wanted) options

The config was not updated for some time so it needs updates to get the
same options as wanted initially:
 - SYSFS_DEPRECATED is now needed for SYSFS_DEPRECATED_V2;
 - DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP was replaced by DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP;
 - Use proper DEBUG_S3C_UART1 for UART1;
