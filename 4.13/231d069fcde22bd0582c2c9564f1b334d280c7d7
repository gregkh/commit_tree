i2c: designware: Round down ACPI provided clk to nearest supported clk

The Lenovo Miix2 8 DSDT contains an i2c clk / bus speed of 1700000 Hz
for one if its devices, which is not supported.

This is the second DSDT to show up with an unsupported clk in a short
time, remove the hardcoded fix for DSDTs with a 1 MiHz clock and simply
always round down the clk to the nearest supported value.
