include/linux/backing-dev.h: simplify wb_stat_sum

wb_stat_sum() disables interrupts and calls __wb_stat_sum() which
eventually calls __percpu_counter_sum().  However, the percpu routine is
already irq-safe.  Simplify the code a bit by making wb_stat_sum()
directly call percpu_counter_sum_positive() and not disable interrupts.

Also remove the now-uneeded __wb_stat_sum() which was just a wrapper
over percpu_counter_sum_positive().
