perf tools: Do parameter validation earlier on fetch_kernel_version()

While trying to reduce util.[ch] I noticed that fetch_kernel_version()
and fetch_ubuntu_kernel_version() do lots of operations only to check if
they are needed, i.e. it checks if the pointer where to return the
kernel version is NULL only after obtaining the kernel version from
/proc/version_signature or by parsing the results from uname().

Do it earlier not to confuse people reading this code in the future :-)
