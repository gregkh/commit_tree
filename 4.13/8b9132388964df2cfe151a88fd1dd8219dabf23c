mm: unify new_node_page and alloc_migrate_target

Commit 394e31d2ceb4 ("mem-hotplug: alloc new page from a nearest
neighbor node when mem-offline") has duplicated a large part of
alloc_migrate_target with some hotplug specific special casing.

To be more precise it tried to enfore the allocation from a different
node than the original page.  As a result the two function diverged in
their shared logic, e.g.  the hugetlb allocation strategy.

Let's unify the two and express different NUMA requirements by the given
nodemask.  new_node_page will simply exclude the node it doesn't care
about and alloc_migrate_target will use all the available nodes.
alloc_migrate_target will then learn to migrate hugetlb pages more
sanely and use preallocated pool when possible.

Please note that alloc_migrate_target used to call alloc_page resp.
alloc_pages_current so the memory policy of the current context which is
quite strange when we consider that it is used in the context of
alloc_contig_range which just tries to migrate pages which stand in the
way.
