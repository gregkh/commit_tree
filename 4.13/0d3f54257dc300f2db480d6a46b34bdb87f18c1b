genirq: Introduce effective affinity mask

There is currently no way to evaluate the effective affinity mask of a
given interrupt. Many irq chips allow only a single target CPU or a subset
of CPUs in the affinity mask.

Updating the mask at the time of setting the affinity to the subset would
be counterproductive because information for cpu hotplug about assigned
interrupt affinities gets lost. On CPU hotplug it's also pointless to force
migrate an interrupt, which is not targeted at the CPU effectively. But
currently the information is not available.

Provide a seperate mask to be updated by the irq_chip->irq_set_affinity()
implementations. Implement the read only proc files so the user can see the
effective mask as well w/o trying to deduce it from /proc/interrupts.
