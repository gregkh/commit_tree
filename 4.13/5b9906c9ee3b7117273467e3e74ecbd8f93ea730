ARM: dts: r8a73a4: update PFC node name to pin-controller

The device trees for Renesas SoCs use either pfc or pin-controller as the
node name for the PFC device. This patch is intended to take a step towards
unifying the node name used as pin-controller which appears to be the more
generic of the two and thus more in keeping with the DT specs.

My analysis is that this is a user-visible change to the extent that kernel
logs, and sysfs entries change from e6050000.pfc and pfc@e6050000 to
e6050000.pin-controller and pin-controller@e6050000.
