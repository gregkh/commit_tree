net/mlx4_en: Replace TXBB_SIZE multiplications with shift operations

Define LOG_TXBB_SIZE, log of TXBB_SIZE, and use it with a shift
operation instead of a multiplication with TXBB_SIZE.
Operations are equivalent as TXBB_SIZE is a power of two.

Performance tests:
Tested on ConnectX3Pro, Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz

Gain is too small to be measurable, no degradation sensed.
Results are similar for IPv4 and IPv6.
