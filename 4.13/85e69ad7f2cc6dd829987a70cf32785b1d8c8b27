KVM: arm/arm64: Move timer IRQ default init to arch_timer.c

We currently initialize the arch timer IRQ numbers from the reset code,
presumably because we once intended to model multiple CPU or SoC types
from within the kernel and have hard-coded reset values in the reset
code.

As we are moving towards userspace being in charge of more fine-grained
CPU emulation and stitching together the pieces needed to emulate a
particular type of CPU, we should no longer have a tight coupling
between resetting a VCPU and setting IRQ numbers.

Therefore, move the logic to define and use the default IRQ numbers to
the timer code and set the IRQ number immediately when creating the
VCPU.
