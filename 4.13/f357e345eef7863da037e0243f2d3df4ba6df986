zram: rework copy of compressor name in comp_algorithm_store()

comp_algorithm_store() passes the size of the source buffer to strlcpy()
instead of the destination buffer size.  Make it explicit that the two
buffers have the same size and use strcpy() instead of strlcpy().  The
latter can be done safely since the function ensures that the string in
the source buffer is terminated.
