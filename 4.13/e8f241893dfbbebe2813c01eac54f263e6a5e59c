genirq: Restore trigger settings in irq_modify_status()

irq_modify_status starts by clearing the trigger settings from
irq_data before applying the new settings, but doesn't restore them,
leaving them to IRQ_TYPE_NONE.

That's pretty confusing to the potential request_irq() that could
follow. Instead, snapshot the settings before clearing them, and restore
them if the irq_modify_status() invocation was not changing the trigger.
