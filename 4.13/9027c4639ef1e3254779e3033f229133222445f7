ALSA: pcm: Call ack() whenever appl_ptr is updated

Although the ack callback is supposed to be called at each appl_ptr or
hw_ptr update, we missed a few opportunities: namely, forward, rewind
and sync_ptr.

Formerly calling ack at rewind may have leaded to unexpected results
due to the forgotten negative appl_ptr update in indirect-PCM helper,
which is the major user of the PCM ack callback.  But now we fixed
this oversights, thus we can call ack callback safely even at rewind
callback -- of course with the proper handling of the error from the
callback.

This patch adds the calls of ack callback in the places mentioned in
the above.
