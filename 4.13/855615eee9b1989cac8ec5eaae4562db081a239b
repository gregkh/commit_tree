x86/tsc: Remove the TSC_ADJUST clamp

Now that all affected platforms have a microcode update; and we check
this and disable TSC_DEADLINE and print a microcode revision update
error if its too old, we can remove the TSC_ADJUST clamp.

This should help with systems where the second socket runs ahead of
the first socket and needs a negative adjustment. In this case we'd
hit the 0 clamp and give up for not achieving synchronization.
