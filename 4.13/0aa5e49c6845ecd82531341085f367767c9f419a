compiler: Add __designated_init annotation

This allows structure annotations for requiring designated initialization
in GCC 5.1.0 and later:
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html

The structure randomization layout plugin will be using this to help
identify structures that need this form of initialization.
