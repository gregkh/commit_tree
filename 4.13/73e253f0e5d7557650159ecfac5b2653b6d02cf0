nfp: map all queue controllers at once

RX and TX queue controllers are interleaved.  Instead of creating
two mappings which map the same area at slightly different offset,
create only one mapping.  Always map all queue controllers to simplify
the code and allow reusing the mapping for non-data vNICs.
