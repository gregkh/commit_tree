f2fs: don't track newly allocated nat entry in list

We will never persist newly allocated nat entries during checkpoint(), so
we don't need to track such nat entries in nat dirty list in order to
avoid:
- more latency during traversing dirty list;
- sorting nat sets incorrectly due to recording wrong entry_cnt in nat
entry set.
