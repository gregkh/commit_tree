net/mlx5e: Use device ID defines

Use Mellanox device ID definitions in the driver's mlx5 ID table so tools
such as 'grep' and 'cscope' can be used to help find correlated material
(such as INTx Masking quirks: d76d2fe05fd PCI: Convert Mellanox broken
INTx quirks to be for listed devices only).

No functional change intended.
