selftests/bpf: Add test cases to test narrower ctx field loads

Add test cases in test_verifier and test_progs.
Negative tests are added in test_verifier as well.
The test in test_progs will compare the value of narrower ctx field
load result vs. the masked value of normal full-field load result,
and will fail if they are not the same.
