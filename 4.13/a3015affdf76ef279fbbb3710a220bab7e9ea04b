serial: imx-serial - move DMA buffer configuration to DT

The size of the DMA buffer can affect the delta time between data being
produced and data being consumed. Basically the DMA system will move
data to tty buffer when a) DMA buffer is full b) serial line is idle.
The situation is visible when producer generates data continuously and
there is no possibility for idle line. At this point the DMA buffer is
directly affecting the delta time.

The patch will add the possibility to configure the DMA buffers in DT,
which case by case can be configured separately for every driver
instance. The DT configuration is optional and in case missing the
driver will use the 4096 buffer with 4 periods (as before), therefore no
clients are impacted by this change.
