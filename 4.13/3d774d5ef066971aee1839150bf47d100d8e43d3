ALSA: seq: Allow the tristate build of OSS emulation

Currently OSS sequencer emulation is tied with ALSA sequencer core,
both are built in the same level; i.e. when CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER=y,
the OSS sequencer emulation is also always built-in, even though the
functionality can be built as an individual module.

This patch changes the rule and allows users to build snd-seq-oss
module while others are built-in.  Essentially, it's just a few simple
changes in Kconfig and Makefile.  Some driver codes like opl3 need to
convert from the simple ifdef to IS_ENABLED().  But that's all.

You might wonder how about the dependency: right, it can be messy, but
it still works.  Since we rewrote the sequencer binding with the
standard bus, the driver can be bound at any time on demand.  So, the
synthesizer driver module can be loaded individually from the OSS
emulation core before/after it.
