VFS: Don't use save/replace_mount_options if not using generic_show_options

btrfs, debugfs, reiserfs and tracefs call save_mount_options() and reiserfs
calls replace_mount_options(), but they then implement their own
->show_options() methods and don't touch s_options, rendering the saved
options unnecessary.  I'm trying to eliminate s_options to make it easier
to implement a context-based mount where the mount options can be passed
individually over a file descriptor.

Remove the calls to save/replace_mount_options() call in these cases.
