[media] ddbridge: support for Sony CXD28xx C/C2/T/T2 tuner modules

Properly detect and attach Ports and Flex modules with the Sony CXD28xxER
series demods. This makes newer Cine cards and most DuoFlex C/C2/T/T2 (or
any combination of these systems) work, PCI IDs need to be added though.

Note: This utilises the CXD2841ER demod driver, which requires the changes
from this patch series to properly work. Without those changes, it won't
function properly (if at all).
