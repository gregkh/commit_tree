drm/i915/skl+: Fail the flip if ddb min requirement exceeds pipe allocation

DDB minimum requirement of crtc configuration (cumulative of all the
enabled planes in crtc) may exceed the allocated DDB for crtc/pipe.
This patch make changes to fail the flip/ioctl if minimum requirement
for pipe exceeds the total ddb allocated to the pipe.
Previously it succeeded but making alloc_size a negative value. Which
will make subsequent calculations for plane ddb allocation bogus & may
lead to screen corruption or system hang.

Changes from V1:
 - Improve commit message as per Ander's comment
 - Remove extra parentheses (Ander)
