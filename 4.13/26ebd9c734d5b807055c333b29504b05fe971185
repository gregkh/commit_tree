drm/i915/perf: avoid poll, read, EAGAIN busy loops

If the function for checking whether there is OA buffer data available
(during a poll or blocking read) has false positives then we want to
avoid a situation where the subsequent read() returns EAGAIN (after
a more accurate check) followed by a poll() immediately reporting
the same false positive POLLIN event and effectively maintaining a
busy loop until there really is data.

This makes sure that we clear the .pollin event status whenever we
return EAGAIN to userspace which will throttle subsequent POLLIN events
and repeated attempts to read to the 5ms intervals of the hrtimer
callback we have.
