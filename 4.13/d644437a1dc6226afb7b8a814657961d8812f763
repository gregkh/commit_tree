tools/testing/selftests/sysctl: Add pre-check to the value of writes_strict

Sysctl test will fail in some items if the value of /proc/sys/kernel
/sysctrl_writes_strict is 0 as the default value in kernel older than v4.5.

Make this test more robus and compatible with older kernel by checking and
update writes_strict value and restore it when test is done.
