lockup-watchdogs.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx.

This file is almost at ReST format. Just one title needs
to be adjusted, in order to follow the standard.
