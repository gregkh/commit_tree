pinctrl: samsung: Clean up modular vs. non-modular distinctions

Fixups here tend to be more all over the map vs. some of the other
repeated/systematic ones we've seen elsewhere.

We remove module.h from code that isn't doing anything modular at
all;  if they have __init sections, then replace it with init.h

A couple drivers have module_exit() code that is essentially orphaned,
and so we remove that.

There are no module_init replacements, so we have no concerns wrt.
initcall ordering changes as per some of the other cleanups.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
