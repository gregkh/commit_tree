drm/vc4: Enable selection in Kconfig on any 32-bit BCM platform.

With the Cygnus port, we needed to add at least "|| ARCH_BCM_CYGNUS"
to let the module get built on a cygnus-only kernel.  However, I
anticipate having a port for Kona soon, so just present the module on
all of BCM.

v2: Keep allowing selection with ARCH_BCM2835, since ARCH_BCM doesn't
    exist on arm64.
