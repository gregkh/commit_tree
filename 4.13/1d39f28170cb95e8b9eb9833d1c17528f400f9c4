drm/i915: Rename intel_engine_cs.exec_id to uabi_id

We want to refer to the index of the engine consistently throughout the
userspace ABI. We already have such an index through the execbuffer
engine specifier, that needs to be able to refer to each engine
specifically, so rename it the index to uabi_id to reflect its
generality beyond execbuf.
