hwmon: (nct6775) Rework temperature source and label handling

Instead of checking if a temperature source has a label, use a bit mask
to determine if a temperature source is valid for a given chip.
This simplifies the code and, if necessary, lets us support chips with
unknown or incomplete labels.
