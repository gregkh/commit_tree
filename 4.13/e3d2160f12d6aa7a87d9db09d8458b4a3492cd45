pinctrl: tegra: clean up modular vs. non-modular distinctions

None of the Kconfigs for any of these drivers are tristate,
meaning that they currently are not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the drivers there is no doubt they are builtin-only.  All
drivers get similar changes, so they are handled in batch.

We remove module.h from code that isn't doing anything modular at
all;  if they have __init sections, then replace it with init.h.

A couple drivers have module_exit() code that is essentially orphaned,
and so we remove that.

Quite a few bool drivers (hence non-modular) are converted over to
to builtin_platform_driver().

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
