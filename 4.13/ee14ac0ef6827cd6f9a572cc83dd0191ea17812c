perf intel-pt: Fix last_ip usage

Intel PT uses IP compression based on the last IP. For decoding
purposes, 'last IP' is considered to be reset to zero whenever there is
a synchronization packet (PSB). The decoder wasn't doing that, and was
treating the zero value to mean that there was no last IP, whereas
compression can be done against the zero value. Fix by setting last_ip
to zero when a PSB is received and keep track of have_last_ip.
