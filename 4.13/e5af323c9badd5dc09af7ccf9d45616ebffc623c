bitmap: optimise bitmap_set and bitmap_clear of a single bit

We have eight users calling bitmap_clear for a single bit and seventeen
calling bitmap_set for a single bit.  Rather than fix all of them to
call __clear_bit or __set_bit, turn bitmap_clear and bitmap_set into
inline functions and make this special case efficient.
