ext4: add ext4_is_quota_file()

IS_NOQUOTA() indicates whether quota is disabled for an inode. Ext4
also uses it to check whether an inode is for a quota file. The
distinction currently doesn't matter because quota is disabled only
for the quota files. When we start disabling quota for other inodes
in the future, we will want to make the distinction clear.

Replace IS_NOQUOTA() call with ext4_is_quota_file() at places where
we are checking for quota files.
