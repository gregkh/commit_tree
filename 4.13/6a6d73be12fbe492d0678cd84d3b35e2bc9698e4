KVM: arm/arm64: properly use vcpu requests

arm/arm64 already has one VCPU request used when setting pause,
but it doesn't properly check requests in VCPU RUN. Check it
and also make sure we set vcpu->mode at the appropriate time
(before the check) and with the appropriate barriers. See
Documentation/virtual/kvm/vcpu-requests.rst. Also make sure we
don't leave any vcpu requests we don't intend to handle later
set in the request bitmap. If we don't clear them, then
kvm_request_pending() may return true when it shouldn't.

Using VCPU requests properly fixes a small race where pause
could get set just as a VCPU was entering guest mode.
