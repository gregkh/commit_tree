KVM: add kvm_request_pending

A first step in vcpu->requests encapsulation.  Additionally, we now
use READ_ONCE() when accessing vcpu->requests, which ensures we
always load vcpu->requests when it's accessed.  This is important as
other threads can change it any time.  Also, READ_ONCE() documents
that vcpu->requests is used with other threads, likely requiring
memory barriers, which it does.
