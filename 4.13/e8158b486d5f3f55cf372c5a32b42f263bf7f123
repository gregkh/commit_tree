device property: Introduce fwnode_call_bool_op() for ops that return bool

fwnode_call_int_op() isn't suitable for calling ops that return bool
since it effectively causes the result returned to the user to be
true when an op hasn't been defined or the fwnode is NULL.

Address this by introducing fwnode_call_bool_op() for calling ops
that return bool.
