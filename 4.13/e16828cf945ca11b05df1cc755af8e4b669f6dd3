usb: gadget: function: f_fs: Move epfile waitqueue to ffs_data.

There were individual waitqueues for each epfile but eps_enable
would iterate through all of them, resulting in essentially the
same wakeup time.

The waitqueue represents the function being enabled, so a central
waitqueue in ffs_data makes more sense and is less redundant.

Also use wake_up_interruptible to reflect use of
wait_event_interruptible.
