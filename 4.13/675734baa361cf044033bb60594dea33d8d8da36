PCI: Enable ECRC only if device supports it

John reported that an Intel QuickAssist crypto accelerator didn't work in a
Dell PowerEdge R730.  The problem seems to be that we enabled ECRC when the
device doesn't support it:

  85:00.0 Co-processor [0b40]: Intel Corporation DH895XCC Series QAT [8086:0435]
    Capabilities: [100 v1] Advanced Error Reporting
      AERCap: First Error Pointer: 00, GenCap- CGenEn+ ChkCap- ChkEn+

1302fcf0d03e ("PCI: Configure *all* devices, not just hot-added ones")
exposed the problem because it applies settings from the _HPX method to all
devices, not just hot-added ones.  The R730 supplies an _HPX method that
allows the kernel to enable ECRC.

Only enable ECRC if the device advertises support for it.
