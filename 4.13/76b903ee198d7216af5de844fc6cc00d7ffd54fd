selftests: Introduce tc testsuite

Add the beginnings of a testsuite for tc functionality in the kernel.
These are a series of unit tests that use the tc executable and verify
the success of those commands by checking both the exit codes and the
output from tc's 'show' operation.

To run the tests:
  # cd tools/testing/selftests/tc-testing
  # sudo ./tdc.py

You can specify the tc executable to use with the -p argument on the command
line or editing the 'TC' variable in tdc_config.py. Refer to the README for
full details on how to run.

The initial complement of test cases are limited mostly to tc actions. Test
cases are most welcome; see the creating-testcases subdirectory for help
in creating them.
