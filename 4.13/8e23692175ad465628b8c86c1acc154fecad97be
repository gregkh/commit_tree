powerpc/watchdog: Fix final-check recovered case

When the watchdog decides to panic, it takes the lock and double
checks everything (to avoid races with the CPU being unstuck or
panic()ed by something else).

The exit label was misplaced and would result in all-CPUs backtrace
and watchdog panic even in the case that the condition was found to be
resolved.
