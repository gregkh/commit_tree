gpiolib: skip unwanted events, don't convert them to opposite edge

The previous fix for filtering out of unwatched events was not entirely
correct. Instead of skipping the events we don't want, they are now
interpreted as events with opposing edge.

In order to fix it: always read the GPIO line value on interrupt and
only emit the event if it corresponds with the event type we requested.
