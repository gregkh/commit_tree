mm: hwpoison: change PageHWPoison behavior on hugetlb pages

We'd like to narrow down the error region in memory error on hugetlb
pages.  However, currently we set PageHWPoison flags on all subpages in
the error hugepage and add # of subpages to num_hwpoison_pages, which
doesn't fit our purpose.

So this patch changes the behavior and we only set PageHWPoison on the
head page then increase num_hwpoison_pages only by 1.  This is a
preparation for narrow-down part which comes in later patches.
