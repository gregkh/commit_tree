[media] media: imx: csi: add support for bayer formats

Bayer formats must be treated as generic data and passthrough mode must
be used.  Add the correct setup for these formats.

- added check to csi_link_validate() to verify that destination is
  IDMAC output pad when passthrough conditions exist: bayer formats
  and 16-bit parallel buses.
