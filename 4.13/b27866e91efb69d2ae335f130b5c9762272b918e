arm64: defconfig: enable Simple Sound Card support

commit 7fa72cca39a0 ("ASoC: rsnd: add HDMI output support")
exchanged Renesas Sound driver's Kconfig selection
from SND_SIMPLE_CARD to SND_SIMPLE_CARD_UTILS, because of this,
defconfig doesn't select SND_SIMPLE_CARD today.
All Renesas platform needs SND_SIMPLE_CARD, Let's select it.
