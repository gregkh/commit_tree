net/sock: add WARN_ON(parent->sk) in sock_graft()

sock_graft() unilaterally sets up parent->sk based on the
assumption that the existing parent->sk is null. If this
condition is not true, then the existing parent->sk would
be leaked, so add a WARN_ON() to alert callers who may fall
in this category.
