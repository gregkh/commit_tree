rtlwifi: Correct power save capability while init mac80211

Since the driver itself will enter power saving mode dynamically
according to the traffic, we set hw capability SUPPORTS_PS and
SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS in case of fwctrl_lps.

The process IEEE80211_CONF_CHANGE_PS in op_config is used by
SW-LPS only, so we add constraints to avoid errors.
