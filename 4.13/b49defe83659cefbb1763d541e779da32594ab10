kvm: avoid unused variable warning for UP builds

The uniprocessor version of smp_call_function_many does not evaluate
all of its argument, and the compiler emits a warning about "wait"
being unused.  This breaks the build on architectures for which
"-Werror" is enabled by default.

Work around it by moving the invocation of smp_call_function_many to
its own inline function.
