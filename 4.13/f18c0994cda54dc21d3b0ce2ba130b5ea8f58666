clk: rockchip: mark noc and some special clk as critical on rk3228

The jtag/bus/peri/initmem/rom/stimer/phy clks no driver to handle them.
But this clks need enable,so make it as critical.

The ddrupctl/ddrmon/ddrphy clks no driver to handle them,
Chip design requirements for these clock to always on,

The hclk_otg_pmu is Chip design defect, must be always on,
The new document will update the description of this clock.

All these non-noc/non-arbi clocks,IC suggest always on,
Because it's have some order limitation, between the NOC clock switch
and bus IDLE(or pd on/off).

The software is not very good to solve this constraint.
Always on these clocks, has no effect on the system power consumption.
The new document will update the description of these clock.
