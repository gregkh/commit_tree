vt: fix unchecked __put_user() in tioclinux ioctls

Only read access is checked before this call.

Actually, at the moment this is not an issue, as every in-tree arch does
the same manual checks for VERIFY_READ vs VERIFY_WRITE, relying on the MMU
to tell them apart, but this wasn't the case in the past and may happen
again on some odd arch in the future.

If anyone cares about 3.7 and earlier, this is a security hole (untested)
on real 80386 CPUs.
