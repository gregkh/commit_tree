drm/nouveau/hwmon: expose the auto_point and pwm_min/max attrs

This patch creates a special group attributes for attrs like "*auto_point*".
We check if we have support for them, and if we do, we gather them all in
an attribute_group's structure which is the parameter regarding special groups
of hwmon_device_register_with_info
We also do the same for pwm_min/max attrs.
