isdn: hisax: hfc4s8s_l1: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  10512	    536	      4	  11052	   2b2c	drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc4s8s_l1.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  10672	    376	      4	  11052	   2b2c	drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc4s8s_l1.o
