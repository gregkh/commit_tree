kvm: vmx: Properly handle machine check during VM-entry

vmx_complete_atomic_exit should call kvm_machine_check for any
VM-entry failure due to a machine-check event. Such an exit should be
recognized solely by its basic exit reason (i.e. the low 16 bits of
the VMCS exit reason field). None of the other VMCS exit information
fields contain valid information when the VM-exit is due to "VM-entry
failure due to machine-check event".
