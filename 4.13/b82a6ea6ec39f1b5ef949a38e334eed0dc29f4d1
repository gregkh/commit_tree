f2fs: don't bother checking for encryption key in ->mmap()

Since only an open file can be mmap'ed, and we only allow open()ing an
encrypted file when its key is available, there is no need to check for
the key again before permitting each mmap().

This f2fs copy of this code was also broken in that it wouldn't actually
have failed if the key was in fact unavailable.
