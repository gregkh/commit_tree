asix: Add rx->ax_skb = NULL after usbnet_skb_return()

In asix_rx_fixup_internal() there is a risk that rx->ax_skb gets
reused after passing the Ethernet frame into the network stack via
usbnet_skb_return().

The risks include:

a) asynchronously freeing rx->ax_skb after passing the netdev buffer
   to the NAPI layer which might corrupt the backlog queue.

b) erroneously reusing rx->ax_skb such as calling skb_put_data() multiple
   times which causes writing off the end of the netdev buffer.

Therefore add a defensive rx->ax_skb = NULL after usbnet_skb_return()
so that it is not possible to free rx->ax_skb or to apply
skb_put_data() too many times.
