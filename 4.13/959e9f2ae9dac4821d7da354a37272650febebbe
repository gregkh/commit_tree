mtd: nand: denali: remove unneeded find_valid_banks()

The function find_valid_banks() issues the Read ID (0x90) command,
then compares the first byte (Manufacturer ID) of each bank with
the one of bank0.

This is equivalent to what nand_scan_ident() does.  The number of
chips is detected there, so this is unneeded.

What is worse for find_valid_banks() is that, if multiple chips are
connected to INTEL_CE4100 platform, it crashes the kernel by BUG().
This is what we should avoid.  This function is just harmful and
unneeded.
