frv: cmpxchg: implement cmpxchg64()

FRV supports 64-bit cmpxchg, which is provided by the arch code as
__cmpxchg_64 and subsequently used to implement atomic64_cmpxchg.

This patch hooks up the generic cmpxchg64 API using the same function,
which also provides default definitions of the relaxed, acquire and
release variants.  This fixes the build when COMPILE_TEST=y and
IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_LPAE=y.
