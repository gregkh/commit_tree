mm/oom_kill.c: add tracepoints for oom reaper-related events

During the debugging of the problem described in
https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/5/17/542 and fixed by Tetsuo Handa in
https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/5/19/383 , I've found that the existing debug
output is not really useful to understand issues related to the oom
reaper.

So, I assume, that adding some tracepoints might help with debugging of
similar issues.

Trace the following events:
 1) a process is marked as an oom victim,
 2) a process is added to the oom reaper list,
 3) the oom reaper starts reaping process's mm,
 4) the oom reaper finished reaping,
 5) the oom reaper skips reaping.

How it works in practice? Below is an example which show how the problem
mentioned above can be found: one process is added twice to the
oom_reaper list:

  $ cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
  $ echo "oom:mark_victim" > set_event
  $ echo "oom:wake_reaper" >> set_event
  $ echo "oom:skip_task_reaping" >> set_event
  $ echo "oom:start_task_reaping" >> set_event
  $ echo "oom:finish_task_reaping" >> set_event
  $ cat trace_pipe
          allocate-502   [001] ....    91.836405: mark_victim: pid=502
          allocate-502   [001] .N..    91.837356: wake_reaper: pid=502
          allocate-502   [000] .N..    91.871149: wake_reaper: pid=502
        oom_reaper-23    [000] ....    91.871177: start_task_reaping: pid=502
        oom_reaper-23    [000] .N..    91.879511: finish_task_reaping: pid=502
        oom_reaper-23    [000] ....    91.879580: skip_task_reaping: pid=502
