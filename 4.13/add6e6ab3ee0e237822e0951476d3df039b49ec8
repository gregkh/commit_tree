iio: pressure: st_pressure_core: disable multiread by default for LPS22HB

Set multiread variable to false for LPS22HB pressure sensor since
it is already enabled in CTRL_REG2. Previous configuration does not
cause any issue in I2C communication since SUB Msb has no meaning
whereas it breaks register address in SPI communication
