net/mlx5: Clean SRIOV eswitch resources upon VF creation failure

Upon sriov enable, eswitch is always enabled.
Currently, if enable hca failed over all VFs, we would skip eswitch
disable as part of sriov disable, which will lead to resources leak.

Fix it by disabling eswitch if it was enabled (use indication from
eswitch mode).
