qed: Duplicate qed_roce.[ch] to qed_rdma.[ch]

This patch adds files that will contain common code for RoCE/iWARP.
The files are currently identical to qed_roce.c / qed_roce.h and
intentionally not added to the makefile. The next patch in the series
will modify the files so that roce specific code is left in qed_roce
and common roce/iwarp code will be placed in qed_rdma

This patch is the result of a simple
cp qed_rdma.c qed_roce.c
cp qed_rdma.h qed_roce.h
