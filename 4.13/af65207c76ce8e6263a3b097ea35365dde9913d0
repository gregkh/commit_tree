ext4: fix __ext4_new_inode() journal credits calculation

ea_inode feature allows creating extended attributes that are up to
64k in size. Update __ext4_new_inode() to pick increased credit limits.

To avoid overallocating too many journal credits, update
__ext4_xattr_set_credits() to make a distinction between xattr create
vs update. This helps __ext4_new_inode() because all attributes are
known to be new, so we can save credits that are normally needed to
delete old values.

Also, have fscrypt specify its maximum context size so that we don't
end up allocating credits for 64k size.
