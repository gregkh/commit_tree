ipv6: add rcu grace period before freeing fib6_node

We currently keep rt->rt6i_node pointing to the fib6_node for the route.
And some functions make use of this pointer to dereference the fib6_node
from rt structure, e.g. rt6_check(). However, as there is neither
refcount nor rcu taken when dereferencing rt->rt6i_node, it could
potentially cause crashes as rt->rt6i_node could be set to NULL by other
CPUs when doing a route deletion.
This patch introduces an rcu grace period before freeing fib6_node and
makes sure the functions that dereference it takes rcu_read_lock().

Note: there is no "Fixes" tag because this bug was there in a very
early stage.
