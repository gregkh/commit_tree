oom, trace: remove ENUM evaluation of COMPACTION_FEEDBACK

After enabling CONFIG_TRACE_ENUM_MAP_FILE (which will soon be renamed to
CONFIG_TRACE_EVAL_MAP_FILE), I am able to examine the enums that have
been evaluated:

 # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/enum_map

(which will soon be renamed to eval_map)

And it showed some interesting results:

  [..]
  ZONE_MOVABLE 3 (oom)
  ZONE_NORMAL 2 (oom)
  ZONE_DMA32 1 (oom)
  ZONE_DMA 0 (oom)
  3 3 (oom)
  2 2 (oom)
  1 1 (oom)
  COMPACT_PRIO_ASYNC 2 (oom)
  COMPACT_PRIO_SYNC_LIGHT 1 (oom)
  COMPACT_PRIO_SYNC_FULL 0 (oom)
  [..]
  ZONE_DMA 0 (vmscan)
  3 3 (vmscan)
  2 2 (vmscan)
  1 1 (vmscan)
  COMPACT_PRIO_ASYNC 2 (vmscan)
  [..]
  ZONE_DMA 0 (kmem)
  3 3 (kmem)
  2 2 (kmem)
  1 1 (kmem)
  COMPACT_PRIO_ASYNC 2 (kmem)
  [..]
  ZONE_DMA 0 (compaction)
  3 3 (compaction)
  2 2 (compaction)
  1 1 (compaction)
  COMPACT_PRIO_ASYNC 2 (compaction)
  [..]

The name within the parenthesis are the trace systems that the enum/eval
maps are associated with. When there's a number evaluated to another
number, that tells me that the TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM() was used on a #define
and not an enum. As #defines get converted normally, they are not needed
to be evaluated.

Each of the above trace systems with the number to number evaluation
included the file include/trace/events/mmflags.h which has:

 /* High-level compaction status feedback */
 #define COMPACTION_FAILED       1
 #define COMPACTION_WITHDRAWN    2
 #define COMPACTION_PROGRESS     3

[..]

 #define COMPACTION_FEEDBACK             \
        EM(COMPACTION_FAILED,           "failed")       \
        EM(COMPACTION_WITHDRAWN,        "withdrawn")    \
        EMe(COMPACTION_PROGRESS,        "progress")

Which is still needed for the __print_symbolic() usage in the
trace_event.  But it is not needed to be evaluated.

Removing the evaluation part removes the unnecessary evaluations of
numbers to numbers.
