dax: set errors in mapping when writeback fails

Jan Kara's description for this patch is much better than mine, so I'm
quoting it verbatim here:

DAX currently doesn't set errors in the mapping when cache flushing
fails in dax_writeback_mapping_range(). Since this function can get
called only from fsync(2) or sync(2), this is actually as good as it can
currently get since we correctly propagate the error up from
dax_writeback_mapping_range() to filemap_fdatawrite()

However, in the future better writeback error handling will enable us to
properly report these errors on fsync(2) even if there are multiple file
descriptors open against the file or if sync(2) gets called before
fsync(2). So convert DAX to using standard error reporting through the
mapping.
