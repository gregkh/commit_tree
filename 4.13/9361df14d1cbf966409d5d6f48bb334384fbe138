cfg80211: Check if PMKID attribute is of expected size

nla policy checks for only maximum length of the attribute data
when the attribute type is NLA_BINARY. If userspace sends less
data than specified, the wireless drivers may access illegal
memory. When type is NLA_UNSPEC, nla policy check ensures that
userspace sends minimum specified length number of bytes.

Remove type assignment to NLA_BINARY from nla_policy of
NL80211_ATTR_PMKID to make this NLA_UNSPEC and to make sure minimum
WLAN_PMKID_LEN bytes are received from userspace with
NL80211_ATTR_PMKID.
