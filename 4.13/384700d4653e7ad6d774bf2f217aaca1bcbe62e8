remoteproc: Drop VIRTUALIZATION dependency from REMOTEPROC

A dependency to VIRTUALIZATION has been added to REMOTEPROC in v3.10
kernel in commit b9777859ec01 ("remoteproc: fix kconfig dependencies
for VIRTIO") to resolve Kconfig warnings due to the inclusion of the
virtio configuration file from the ARM's KVM config file. The KVM
config was fixed properly in the subsequent release in commit
8bd4ffd6b3a9 ("ARM: kvm: don't include drivers/virtio/Kconfig").
So, drop this unneeded VIRTUALIZATION dependency from REMOTEPROC.
