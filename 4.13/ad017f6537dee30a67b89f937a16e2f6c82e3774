xfs: pass along transaction context when reading xattr block buffers

Teach the extended attribute reading functions to pass along a
transaction context if one was supplied.  The extended attribute scrub
code will use transactions to lock buffers and avoid deadlocking with
itself in the case of loops; since it will already have the inode
locked, also create xattr get/list helpers that don't take locks.
