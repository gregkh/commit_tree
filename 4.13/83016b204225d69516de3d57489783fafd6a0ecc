arm64: mm: print file name of faulting vma

Print out the name of the file associated with the vma that faulted.
This is usually the executable or shared library name. We already print
out the task name, but also printing the library name is useful for
pinpointing bugs to libraries.

Also print the base address and size of the vma, which together with the
PC (printed by __show_regs) gives the offset into the library.

Fault prints now look like:
test[2361]: unhandled level 2 translation fault (11) at 0x00000012, esr 0x92000006, in libfoo.so[ffffa0145000+1000]

This is already done on x86, for more details see commit 03252919b798
("x86: print which shared library/executable faulted in segfault etc.
messages v3").
