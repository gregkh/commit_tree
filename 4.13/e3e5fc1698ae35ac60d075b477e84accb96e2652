xfrm_user: fix info leak in build_expire()

The memory reserved to dump the expired xfrm state includes padding
bytes in struct xfrm_user_expire added by the compiler for alignment. To
prevent the heap info leak, memset(0) the remainder of the struct.
Initializing the whole structure isn't needed as copy_to_user_state()
already takes care of clearing the padding bytes within the 'state'
member.
