fault-inject: make fail-nth read/write interface symmetric

The read interface for fail-nth looks a bit odd.  Read from this file
returns "NYYYY..." or "YYYYY..." (this makes me surprise when cat this
file).  Because there is no EOF condition.  The first character
indicates current->fail_nth is zero or not, and then current->fail_nth
is reset to zero.

Just returning task->fail_nth value is more natural to understand.
