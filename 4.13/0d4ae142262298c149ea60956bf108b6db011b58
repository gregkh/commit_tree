rtlwifi: btcoex: 23b 1ant: adjust wifi duration for bt a2dp

The larger the bt a2dp bit pool is, the more time bt needs to receive
them. If we do not adjust the wifi duration, the voice quality will be
low. Hence we reduce the time that wifi holds, to improve the a2dp
service.

If the bt is slave, it may receive a packet at any time, so we
need to mark them as high priority packets in case of packet loss
