ipv6: do not set sk_destruct in IPV6_ADDRFORM sockopt

ChunYu found a kernel warn_on during syzkaller fuzzing:

The warn_on happned when sk->sk_rmem_alloc wasn't 0 in inet_sock_destruct.
As after commit f970bd9e3a06 ("udp: implement memory accounting helpers"),
udp has changed to use udp_destruct_sock as sk_destruct where it would
udp_rmem_release all rmem.

But IPV6_ADDRFORM sockopt sets sk_destruct with inet_sock_destruct after
changing family to PF_INET. If rmem is not 0 at that time, and there is
no place to release rmem before calling inet_sock_destruct, the warn_on
will be triggered.

This patch is to fix it by not setting sk_destruct in IPV6_ADDRFORM sockopt
any more. As IPV6_ADDRFORM sockopt only works for tcp and udp. TCP sock has
already set it's sk_destruct with inet_sock_destruct and UDP has set with
udp_destruct_sock since they're created.
