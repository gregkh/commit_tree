x86, dax, libnvdimm: remove wb_cache_pmem() indirection

With all handling of the CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PMEM_API case being moved to
libnvdimm and the pmem driver directly we do not need to provide global
wrappers and fallbacks in the CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PMEM_API=n case. The pmem
driver will simply not link to arch_wb_cache_pmem() in that case.  Same
as before, pmem flushing is only defined for x86_64, via
clean_cache_range(), but it is straightforward to add other archs in the
future.

arch_wb_cache_pmem() is an exported function since the pmem module needs
to find it, but it is privately declared in drivers/nvdimm/pmem.h because
there are no consumers outside of the pmem driver.
