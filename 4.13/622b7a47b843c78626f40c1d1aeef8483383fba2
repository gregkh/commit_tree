perf intel-pt: Use FUP always when scanning for an IP

The decoder will try to use branch packets to find an IP to start decoding
or to recover from errors. Currently the FUP packet is used only in the
case of an overflow, however there is no reason for that to be a special
case. So just use FUP always when scanning for an IP.
