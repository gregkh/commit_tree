arm,arm64,drivers: reduce scope of cap_parsing_failed

Reduce the scope of cap_parsing_failed (making it static in
drivers/base/arch_topology.c) by slightly changing {arm,arm64} DT
parsing code.

For arm checking for !cap_parsing_failed before calling normalize_
cpu_capacity() is superfluous, as returning an error from parse_
cpu_capacity() (above) means cap_from _dt is set to false.

For arm64 we can simply check if raw_capacity points to something,
which is not if capacity parsing has failed.
