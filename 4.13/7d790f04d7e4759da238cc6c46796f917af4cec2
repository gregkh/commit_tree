scsi: lpfc: Fix nvme port role handling in sysfs and debugfs handlers.

While debugging Devloss and recovery, debugfs and sysfs were found to
not show the NVME port roles consistently.

The port role FC_PORT_ROLE_NVME_DISCOVERY was added with the devloss
bringup and the other issues were just oversight.

Add NVME Target and DISCSRVC to debugfs nodeinfo and sysfs nvme info
handlers. The full port role was added to the NVME data only not the
generic nodelist.
