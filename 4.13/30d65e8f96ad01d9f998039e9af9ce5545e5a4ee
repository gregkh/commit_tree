net: sched: don't do tcf_chain_flush from tcf_chain_destroy

tcf_chain_flush needs to be called with RTNL. However, on
free_tcf->
 tcf_action_goto_chain_fini->
  tcf_chain_put->
   tcf_chain_destroy->
    tcf_chain_flush
callpath, it is called without RTNL.
This issue was notified by following warning:

[  155.599052] WARNING: suspicious RCU usage
[  155.603165] 4.13.0-rc5jiri+ #54 Not tainted
[  155.607456] -----------------------------
[  155.611561] net/sched/cls_api.c:195 suspicious rcu_dereference_protected() usage!

Since on this callpath, the chain is guaranteed to be already empty
by check in tcf_chain_put, move the tcf_chain_flush call out and call it
only where it is needed - into tcf_block_put.
