mmtimer: Remove the SGI SN2 mmtimer driver

This driver supports direct system clock access on the ancient SGI SN2
IA64 systems, and implement the only non-builtin k_clock instance.
Remove it as any remaining IA64 altix user will be running just as old
distros anyway.

Dimitri Sivanich stated: "Since this is SN2 specific, this can be removed."

Note that this does not affect the never uv_mmtimer driver for x86-based
Altix systems.
