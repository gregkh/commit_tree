scsi: cxlflash: Update TMF command processing

Currently, the SCSI command presented to the device reset handler is used
to send TMFs to the AFU for a device reset. This behavior is incorrect as
the command presented is an actual command and not a special notification.
As such, it should only be used for reference and not be acted upon.

Additionally, the existing TMF transmission routine does not account for
actual errors from the hardware, only reflecting failure when a timeout
occurs. This can lead to a condition where the device reset handler is
presented with a false 'success'.

Update send_tmf() to dynamically allocate a private command for sending
the TMF command and properly reflect failure when the completed command
indicates an error or was aborted. Detect TMF commands during response
processing and avoid scsi_done() for these types of commands. Lastly,
update comments in the TMF processing paths to describe the new behavior.
