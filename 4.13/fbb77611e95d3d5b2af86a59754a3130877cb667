Fix compat_sys_sigpending breakage

The latest change of compat_sys_sigpending in commit 8f13621abced
("sigpending(): move compat to native") has broken it in two ways.

First, it tries to write 4 bytes more than userspace expects:
sizeof(old_sigset_t) == sizeof(long) == 8 instead of
sizeof(compat_old_sigset_t) == sizeof(u32) == 4.

Second, on big endian architectures these bytes are being written in the
wrong order.

This bug was found by strace test suite.
