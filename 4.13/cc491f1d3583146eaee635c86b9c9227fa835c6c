powerpc/64s: Fix stack setup in watchdog soft_nmi_common()

The watchdog soft-NMI exception stack setup loads a stack pointer
twice, which is an obvious error. It ends up using the system reset
interrupt (true-NMI) stack, which is also a bug because the watchdog
could be preempted by a system reset interrupt that overwrites the
NMI stack.

Change the soft-NMI to use the "emergency stack". The current kernel
stack is not used, because of the longer-term goal to prevent
asynchronous stack access using soft-disable.
