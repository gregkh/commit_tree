svcrdma: Improve Write chunk sanity checking

Identify malformed transport headers and unsupported chunk
combinations as early as possible.

- Reject RPC-over-RDMA messages that contain more than one Write
chunk, since this implementation does not support more than one per
message.

- Ensure that segment lengths are not crazy.

- Ensure that the chunk's segment count is not crazy.

With a 1KB inline threshold, the largest number of Write segments
that can be conveyed is about 60 (for a RDMA_NOMSG Reply message).
