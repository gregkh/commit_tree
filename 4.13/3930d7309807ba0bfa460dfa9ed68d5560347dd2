scsi: storvsc: use default I/O timeout handler for FC devices

FC disks issue I/O directly to the host storage port driver, this is
diffirent to VHD disks where I/O is virtualized and timeout is handled
by the host VSP (Virtualization Service Provider).

FC disks are usually setup in a multipath system, and they don't want to
reset timer on I/O timeout. Timeout is detected by multipath as a good
time to failover and recover.
