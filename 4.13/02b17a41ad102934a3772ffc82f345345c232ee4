thunderbolt: Refactor and fix parsing of port drom entries

Currently tb_drom_parse_entry() is only able to parse drom entries of
type TB_DROM_ENTRY_PORT. Rename it to tb_drom_parse_entry_port().
Fold tb_drom_parse_port_entry() into it.

Its return value is currently ignored. Evaluate it and abort parsing on
error.

Change tb_drom_parse_entries() to accommodate for parsing of other entry
types than TB_DROM_ENTRY_PORT.
