regmap: make LZO cache optional

Commit 2cbbb579bcbe3 ("regmap: Add the LZO cache support") added support
for LZO compression in regcache, but there were never any users added
afterwards. Since LZO support itself has its own size, it currently is
rather a deoptimization.

So make it optional by introducing a symbol that can be selected by
drivers wanting to make use of it.

Saves e.g. ~46 kB on MIPS (size of LZO support + regcache LZO code).
