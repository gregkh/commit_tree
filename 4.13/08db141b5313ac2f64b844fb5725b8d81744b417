reiserfs: fix race in prealloc discard

The main loop in __discard_prealloc is protected by the reiserfs write lock
which is dropped across schedules like the BKL it replaced.  The problem is
that it checks the value, calls a routine that schedules, and then adjusts
the state.  As a result, two threads that are calling
reiserfs_prealloc_discard at the same time can race when one calls
reiserfs_free_prealloc_block, the lock is dropped, and the other calls
reiserfs_free_prealloc_block with the same block number.  In the right
circumstances, it can cause the prealloc count to go negative.
