drm/vc4: Add runtime PM support to the HDMI encoder driver

The HDMI driver is currently enabling all clocks at probe time and
keeps the power-domain connected to the HDMI encoder enabled.

Move all activation code to vc4_hdmi_encoder_enable() and make sure
the clks and power domain are released when the HDMI encoder is not used
by adding deactivation steps in vc4_hdmi_encoder_disable().

Note that the sequencing imposed by the IP requires that we move
vc4_hdmi_encoder_mode_set() code into vc4_hdmi_encoder_enable().
