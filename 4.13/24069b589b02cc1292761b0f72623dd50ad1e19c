ASoC: hdmi-codec: remove multi detection support

DesignWare HDMI driver (= dw-hdmi) is supporting HDMI sound, and its
probe function was calling sound binding function multiple times as
same HDMI device different port.

Because of this behavior, commit 9731f82d601 ("ASoC: hdmi-codec: enable
multi probe for ...") was added for multi detection case.
But, this DesignWare HDMI detection/bind code was exchanged/adjusted by
commit 69497eb9234 ("drm: bridge: dw-hdmi: Implement DRM bridge...").
Now, all DesignWare HDMI sound ports are detected as 1 bindng function.

Because of this, hdmi-codec multi detection support is no longer needed.
Thus, this patch removes
commit 9731f82d601 ("ASoC: hdmi-codec: enable multi probe for ..."),
and its related
commit 340327a62c4 ("ASoC: hdmi-codec: Fix hdmi_of_xlate_dai_name...")
commit 8480ac56795 ("ASoC: hdmi-codec: remove HDMI device unregister")
commit 0c343a35bfe ("ASoC: hdmi-codec: fix spelling mistake: ...)
