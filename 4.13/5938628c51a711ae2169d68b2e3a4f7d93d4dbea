drm/radeon: make MacBook Pro d3_delay quirk more generic

The PCI Power Management Spec, r1.2, sec 5.6.1, requires a 10 millisecond
delay when powering on a device, i.e., transitioning from state D3hot to
D0.

Apparently some devices require more time, and d1f9809ed131 ("drm/radeon:
add quirk for d3 delay during switcheroo poweron for apple macbooks") added
an additional delay for the Radeon device in a MacBook Pro.  4807c5a8a0c8
("drm/radeon: add a PX quirk list") made the affected device more explicit.

Add a generic PCI quirk to increase the d3_delay.  This means we will use
the additional delay for *all* wakeups from D3, not just those initiated by
radeon_switcheroo_set_state().
