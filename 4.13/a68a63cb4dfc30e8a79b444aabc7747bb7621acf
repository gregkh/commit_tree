irqchip/irq-mvebu-gicp: Add new driver for Marvell GICP

This commit adds a simple driver for the Marvell GICP, a hardware unit
that converts memory writes into GIC SPI interrupts. The driver provides
a number of functions to the ICU driver to allocate GICP interrupts, and
get the physical addresses that the ICUs should write to to set/clear
interrupts.
