ACPICA: Changing External to a named object

ACPICA commit 0d5dd42fd7d5129835b6d92250378a962eb73cb3

This is done so that the aml parser will build the parse tree of
External Op as a named object. This is done to streamline creation
of external op parse nodes and facilitate namespace resolution of
externals.
