drm/i915: Use fb->pitches[0] in cursor code

The cursor code currently ignores fb->pitches[0] (except when creating
the fb itself), and just uses the cursor_width*4 as the stride. Let's
make sure fb->pitches[0] actually matches what we expect it to be.

We can also relax the stride vs. cursor width relationship on 845/865
since the stride is programmed separately. The only constraint is that
width*cpp doesn't exceed the stride, and that's already been checked
by the core since it makes sure the entire plane fits within the fb.

We can also drop the bo size check as that's already checked when
we create the fb. That is the fb is guaranteed to fit within the bo.

v2: Rebase due to i845_cursor_ctl() and i9xx_cursor_ctl()
