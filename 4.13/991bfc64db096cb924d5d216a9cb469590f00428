drm/i915: Make ptr_unpack_bits() more function-like

ptr_unpack_bits() is a function-like macro, as such it is meant to be
replaceable by a function. In this case, we should be passing in the
out-param as a pointer.

Bizarrely this does affect code generation:

function                                     old     new   delta
i915_gem_object_pin_map                      409     389     -20

An improvement(?) in this case, but one can't help wonder what
strict-aliasing optimisations we are preventing.

The generated code looks identical in using ptr_unpack_bits (no extra
motions to stack, the pointer and bits appear to be kept in registers),
the difference appears to be code ordering and with a reorder it is able
to use smaller forward jumps.
