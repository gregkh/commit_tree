apparmor: add namespace lookup fns()

Currently lookups are restricted to a single ns component in the
path. However when namespaces are allowed to have separate views, and
scopes this will not be sufficient, as it will be possible to have
a multiple component ns path in scope.

Add some ns lookup fns() to allow this and use them.
