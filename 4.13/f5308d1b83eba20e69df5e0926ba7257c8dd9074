Input: xpad - fix PowerA init quirk for some gamepad models

The PowerA gamepad initialization quirk worked with the PowerA
wired gamepad I had around (0x24c6:0x543a), but a user reported [0]
that it didn't work for him, even though our gamepads shared the
same vendor and product IDs.

When I initially implemented the PowerA quirk, I wanted to avoid
actually triggering the rumble action during init. My tests showed
that my gamepad would work correctly even if it received a rumble
of 0 intensity, so that's what I went with.

Unfortunately, this apparently isn't true for all models (perhaps
a firmware difference?). This non-working gamepad seems to require
the real magic rumble packet that the Microsoft driver sends, which
actually vibrates the gamepad. To counteract this effect, I still
send the old zero-rumble PowerA quirk packet which cancels the
rumble effect before the motors can spin up enough to vibrate.
