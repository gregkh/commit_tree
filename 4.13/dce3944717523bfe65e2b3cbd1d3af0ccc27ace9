video: fbdev: intelfb: move inline before return type

Make the code like the rest of the kernel.

But there is an oddity here because the inline should probably be removed.

It's an extern function in intelfb.h and it is used in intelfbdrv.c and
intelfbhw.c.

The inline is kept here as I suppose it's possible for some compiler to
make the uses inline in intelfbdrv and and also create an external
function for intelfbhw.
