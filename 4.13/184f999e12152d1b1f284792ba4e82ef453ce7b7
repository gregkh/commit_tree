btrfs: add helper to initialize the non-bio part of btrfs_io_bio

We use btrfs_bioset for bios and ask to allocate the entire size of
btrfs_io_bio from btrfs bio_alloc_bioset. The member 'bio' is
initialized but the bytes from 0 to offset of 'bio' are left
uninitialized. Although we initialize some of the members in our
helpers, we should initialize the whole structures.
