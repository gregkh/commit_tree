ACPICA: ACPI 6.2: Add support for PinConfig() resource

ACPICA commit a06fdba686cefccd5dd5b93b52fa0f1e3f984906

ACPI 6.2 introduced a new resource that is used to specify fine-grained
configuration of a pin or set of pins used by a device. The ASL syntax of
this new resource looks like:

  PinConfig (Shared/Exclusive, PinConfigType, PinConfigValue,
             ResourceSource, ResourceSourceIndex, ResourceUsage,
             DescriptorName, Vendordata) {Pin List}

PinConfigType is an integer with following accepted values:

  0x00 (Default) - No configuration is applied to the pin
  0x01 (Bias Pull-up) - Pin is pulled up using certain size resistor
  0x02 (Bias Pull-down) - Pin is pulled down using certain size resistor
  0x03 (Bias Default) - Set to default biasing
  0x04 (Bias Disable) - All bias settings will be disabled
  0x05 (Bias High Impedance) - Configure the pin as hi_z
  0x06 (Bias Bus Hold) - Configure the pin in a weak latch state where
                         it drives the last value on a tristate bus
  0x07 (Drive Open Drain) - Configure the pin into open drain state
  0x08 (Drive Open Source) - Configure the pin into open source state
  0x09 (Drive Push Pull) - Configure the pin into push-pull state
  0x0a (Drive Strength) - How much the pin can supply current
  0x0b (Slew Rate) - Configure slew rate of the pin
  0x0c (Input Debounce) - Enable input debouncer for the pin
  0x0d (Input Schmitt Trigger) - Enable schmitt trigger for the pin
  0x0e - 0x7f - Reserved
  0x80 - 0xff - Vendor defined types

The PinConfigValue depends on the type and is expressed as units
suitable for that type (for example bias uses Ohms).
