ext4: add largedir feature

This INCOMPAT_LARGEDIR feature allows larger directories to be created
in ldiskfs, both with directory sizes over 2GB and and a maximum htree
depth of 3 instead of the current limit of 2. These features are needed
in order to exceed the current limit of approximately 10M entries in a
single directory.

This patch was originally written by Yang Sheng to support the Lustre server.
