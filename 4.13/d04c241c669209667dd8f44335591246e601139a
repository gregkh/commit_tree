xfs: Check for m_errortag initialization in xfs_errortag_test

While adding error injection into IO completion, I notice the lack of
initialization check in xfs_errortag_test(), make the error injection
mechanism unable to be used there.

IO completion is executed a few times before the error injection
mechanism is initialized, so to be safer, make xfs_errortag_test() check
if the errortag is properly initialized.
