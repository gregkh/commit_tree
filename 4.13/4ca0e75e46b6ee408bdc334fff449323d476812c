thermal: int340x: check for sensor when PTYP is missing

For INT3403 sensor PTYP field is mandatory. But some platforms didn't
have this field for sensors. This cause load failure for int3403 driver.

This change checks for the presence of _TMP method and if present, then
treats this device as a sensor.
