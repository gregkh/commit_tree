net: bridge: Add support for offloading port attributes

Currently the flood, learning and learning_sync port attributes are
offloaded by setting the SELF flag. Add support for offloading the
flood and learning attribute through the bridge code. In case of
setting an unsupported flag on a offloded port the operation will
fail.

The learning_sync attribute doesn't have any software representation
and cannot be offloaded through the bridge code.
