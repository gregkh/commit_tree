ALSA: pcm: Disable only control mmap for explicit appl_ptr sync

Now that user-space (typically alsa-lib) can specify which protocol
version it supports, we can optimize the kernel code depending on the
reported protocol version.

In this patch, we change the previous hack for enforcing the appl_ptr
sync by disabling status/control mmap.  Instead of forcibly disabling
both mmaps, we disable only the control mmap when user-space declares
the supported protocol version new enough.  For older user-space,
still both PCM status and control mmaps are disabled when requested by
the driver due to the compatibility reason.
