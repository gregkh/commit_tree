scsi: qla2xxx: Protect access to qpair members with qpair->qp_lock

In qla2xx_start_scsi_mq() and qla2xx_dif_start_scsi_mq() we grab the
qpair->qp_lock but do access members of the qpair before having the lock.
Re-order the locking sequence to have all read and write access to qpair
members under the qpair->qp_lock.
