checkpatch: silence perl 5.26.0 unescaped left brace warnings

As of perl 5, version 26, subversion 0 (v5.26.0) some new warnings have
occurred when running checkpatch.

Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in
Perl 5.30), passed through in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/^(.\s*){
<-- HERE \s*/ at scripts/checkpatch.pl line 3544.

Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in
Perl 5.30), passed through in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/^(.\s*){
<-- HERE \s*/ at scripts/checkpatch.pl line 3885.

Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in
Perl 5.30), passed through in regex; marked by <-- HERE in
m/^(\+.*(?:do|\))){ <-- HERE / at scripts/checkpatch.pl line 4374.

It seems perfectly reasonable to do as the warning suggests and simply
escape the left brace in these three locations.
