imx-serial: RX DMA startup latency

18a4208 introduced a change to reduce the RX DMA latency on the first reception
when the serial port was opened for reading. However it was claiming a hardirq
unsafe lock after a hardirq safe lock which is not allowed and causes lockdep
to complain verbosely.

This patch changes the code to always start RX DMA earlier, instead of
relying on the flags used to open the serial port removing the code that
was looking for the serial file flags.
