Revert "mm: numa: defer TLB flush for THP migration as long as possible"

While deferring TLB flushes is a good practice, the reverted patch
caused pending TLB flushes to be checked while the page-table lock is
not taken.  As a result, in architectures with weak memory model (PPC),
Linux may miss a memory-barrier, miss the fact TLB flushes are pending,
and cause (in theory) a memory corruption.

Since the alternative of using smp_mb__after_unlock_lock() was
considered a bit open-coded, and the performance impact is expected to
be small, the previous patch is reverted.

This reverts b0943d61b8fa ("mm: numa: defer TLB flush for THP migration
as long as possible").
