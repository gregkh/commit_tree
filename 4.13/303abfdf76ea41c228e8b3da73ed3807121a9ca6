Commit 30a5b5367ef9 ("percpu: expose statistics about percpu memory via
debugfs") introduces percpu memory statistics. pcpu_stats_chunk_alloc
takes the spin lock and disables/enables irqs on creation of a chunk. Irqs
are not enabled when the first chunk is initialized and thus kernels are
failing to boot with kernel debugging enabled. Fixed by changing _irq to
_irqsave and _irqrestore.
