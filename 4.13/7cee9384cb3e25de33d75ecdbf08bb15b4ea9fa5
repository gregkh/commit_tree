Fix up over-eager 'wait_queue_t' renaming

Commit ac6424b981bc ("sched/wait: Rename wait_queue_t =>
wait_queue_entry_t") had scripted the renaming incorrectly, and didn't
actually check that the 'wait_queue_t' was a full token.

As a result, it also triggered on 'wait_queue_token', and renamed that
to 'wait_queue_entry_token' entry in the autofs4 packet structure
definition too.  That was entirely incorrect, and not intended.

The end result built fine when building just the kernel - because
everything had been renamed consistently there - but caused problems in
user space because the "struct autofs_packet_missing" type is exported
as part of the uapi.

This scripts it all back again:

    git grep -lw wait_queue_entry_token |
        xargs sed -i 's/wait_queue_entry_token/wait_queue_token/g'

and checks the end result.
