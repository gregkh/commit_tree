net/mlx4_core: Fixes missing capability bit in flags2 capability dump

The cited commit introduced the following new enum value in file
include/linux/mlx4/device.h:

    QUERY_DEV_CAP_DIAG_RPRT_PER_PORT

However, it failed to introduce a corresponding entry in function
dump_dev_cap_flags2() for outputting a line in the message log
when this capability bit is set.

The change here fixes that omission.
