mtd: nand: denali: use non-managed kmalloc() for DMA buffer

As Russell and Lars stated in the discussion [1], using
devm_k*alloc() with DMA is not a good idea.

Let's use kmalloc (not kzalloc because no need for zero-out).
Also, allocate the buffer as late as possible because it must be
freed for any error that follows.
