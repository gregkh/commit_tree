mtd: handle partitioning on devices with 0 erasesize

erasesize is meaningful for flash devices but for SRAM there is no
concept of an erase block so erasesize is set to 0. When partitioning
these devices instead of ensuring partitions fall on erasesize
boundaries we ensure they fall on writesize boundaries.
