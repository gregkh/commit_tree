x86/power/64: Use char arrays for asm function names

This switches the hibernate_64.S function names into character arrays
to match other areas of the kernel where this is done (e.g., linker
scripts). Specifically this fixes a compile-time error noticed by the
future CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE routines that complained about PAGE_SIZE
being copied out of the "single byte" core_restore_code variable.

Additionally drops the "acpi_save_state_mem" exern which does not
appear to be used anywhere else in the kernel.
