btrfs: round down size diff when shrinking/growing device

Further testing showed that the fix introduced in 7dfb8be11b5d ("btrfs:
Round down values which are written for total_bytes_size") was
insufficient and it could still lead to discrepancies between the
total_bytes in the super block and the device total bytes. So this patch
also ensures that the difference between old/new sizes when
shrinking/growing is also rounded down. This ensure that we won't be
subtracting/adding a non-sectorsize multiples to the superblock/device
total sizees.
