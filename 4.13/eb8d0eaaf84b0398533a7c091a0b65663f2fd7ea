ALSA: hda: Fix potential race at unregistration and unsol events

When the codec device is unregistered / freed, it may release the
resource while being used in an unsolicited event like the jack
detection work.  This leads to use-after-free.

The fix here is to unregister the device at first, i.e. removing the
codec from the list, then flushing the pending works to assure that
all unsol events are gone.  After this point, we're free from
accessing the codec via unsol events, thus can release the resources
gracefully.

The issue was spotted originally by Intel CI, but it couldn't be
reproduced reliably by its nature.  So let's hope this fix really
addresses the whole issues.
