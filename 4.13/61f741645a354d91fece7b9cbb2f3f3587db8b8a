parse-maintainers: Add section pattern sorting

Section [A-Z]: patterns are not currently in any required sorting order.
Add a specific sorting sequence to MAINTAINERS entries.
Sort F: and X: patterns in alphabetic order.

The preferred section ordering is:

  SECTION HEADER
  M:	Maintainers
  R:	Reviewers
  P:	Named persons without email addresses
  L:	Mailing list addresses
  S:	Status of this section (Supported, Maintained, Orphan, etc...)
  W:	Any relevant URLs
  T:	Source code control type (git, quilt, etc)
  Q:	Patchwork patch acceptance queue site
  B:	Bug tracking URIs
  C:	Chat URIs
  F:	Files with wildcard patterns (alphabetic ordered)
  X:	Excluded files with wildcard patterns (alphabetic ordered)
  N:	Files with regex patterns
  K:	Keyword regexes in source code for maintainership identification

Miscellaneous perl neatening:

 - Rename %map to %hash, map has a different meaning in perl
 - Avoid using \& and local variables for function indirection
 - Use return for a little c like clarity
 - Use c-like function call style instead of &function
