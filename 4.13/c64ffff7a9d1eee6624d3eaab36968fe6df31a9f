i2c: core: Allow empty id_table in ACPI case as well

For now empty ID table is not allowed with ACPI and prevents driver to
be probed.

Add a check to allow empty ID table.

This introduces a helper i2c_acpi_match_device().

Note, we rename some static function in i2c-core-acpi.c to distinguish
with public API.
