cpufreq: intel_pstate: constify attribute_group structures

attribute_groups are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with attribute_groups provided by <linux/sysfs.h> work with const
attribute_group. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  15197	   2552	     40	  17789	   457d	drivers/cpufreq/intel_pstate.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  15261	   2488	     40	  17789	   457d	drivers/cpufreq/intel_pstate.o
