ext4: fix SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA for blocksize < pagesize

ext4_find_unwritten_pgoff() does not properly handle a situation when
starting index is in the middle of a page and blocksize < pagesize. The
following command shows the bug on filesystem with 1k blocksize:

  xfs_io -f -c "falloc 0 4k" \
            -c "pwrite 1k 1k" \
            -c "pwrite 3k 1k" \
            -c "seek -a -r 0" foo

In this example, neither lseek(fd, 1024, SEEK_HOLE) nor lseek(fd, 2048,
SEEK_DATA) will return the correct result.

Fix the problem by neglecting buffers in a page before starting offset.
