scsi: virtio_scsi: let host do exception handling

virtio_scsi tries to do exception handling after the default 30 seconds
timeout expires.  However, it's better to let the host control the
timeout, otherwise with a heavy I/O load it is likely that an abort will
also timeout.  This leads to fatal errors like filesystems going
offline.

Disable the 'sd' timeout and allow the host to do exception handling,
following the precedent of the storvsc driver.

Hannes has a proposal to introduce timeouts in virtio, but this provides
an immediate solution for stable kernels too.
