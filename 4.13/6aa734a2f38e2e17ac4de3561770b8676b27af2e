libnvdimm, region, pmem: fix 'badblocks' sysfs_get_dirent() reference lifetime

We need to hold a reference on the 'dirent' until we are sure there are
no more notifications that will be sent. As noted in the new comments we
take advantage of the fact that the references are taken and dropped
under device_lock() and that nd_device_notify() holds device_lock() over
new badblocks notifications. The notifications that happen when
badblocks are cleared only occur while the device is active.

Also take the opportunity to fix up the error messages to report the
user visible effect of a sysfs_get_dirent() failure.
