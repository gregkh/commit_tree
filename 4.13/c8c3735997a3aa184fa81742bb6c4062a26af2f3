parisc: Enhance detection of synchronous cr16 clocksources

The cr16 clocks of the physical PARISC CPUs are usually nonsynchronous.
Nevertheless, it seems that each CPU socket (which holds two cores) of
PA8800 and PA8900 CPUs (e.g. in a C8000 workstation) is fed by the same
clock source, which makes the cr16 clocks of each CPU socket syncronous.
Let's try to detect such situations and mark the cr16 clocksource stable
on single-socket and single-core machines.
