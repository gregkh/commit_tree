libnvdimm, label: add address abstraction identifiers

Starting with v1.2 labels, 'address abstractions' can be hinted via an
address abstraction id that implies an info-block format. The standard
address abstraction in the specification is the v2 format of the
Block-Translation-Table (BTT). Support for that is saved for a later
patch, for now we add support for the Linux supported address
abstractions BTT (v1), PFN, and DAX.

The new 'holder_class' attribute for namespace devices is added for
tooling to specify the 'abstraction_guid' to store in the namespace label.
For v1.1 labels this field is undefined and any setting of
'holder_class' away from the default 'none' value will only have effect
until the driver is unloaded. Setting 'holder_class' requires that
whatever device tries to claim the namespace must be of the specified
class.
