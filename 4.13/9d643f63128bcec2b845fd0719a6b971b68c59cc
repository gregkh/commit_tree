KVM: x86: avoid large stack allocations in em_fxrstor

em_fxstor previously called fxstor_fixup.  Both created instances of
struct fxregs_state on the stack, which triggered the warning:

arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c:4018:12: warning: stack frame size of 1080 bytes
in function
      'em_fxrstor' [-Wframe-larger-than=]
static int em_fxrstor(struct x86_emulate_ctxt *ctxt)
           ^
with CONFIG_FRAME_WARN set to 1024.

This patch does the fixup in em_fxstor now, avoiding one additional
struct fxregs_state, and now fxstor_fixup can be removed as it has no
other call sites.

Further, the calculation for offsets into xmm_space can be shared
between em_fxstor and em_fxsave.
