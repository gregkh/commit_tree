arm64: use readq() instead of readl() to read 64bit entry_point

Here the entrypoint, declared as a 64 bit integer, is read from
a pointer to 64bit integer but the read is done via readl_relaxed()
which is for 32bit quantities.

All the high bits will thus be lost which change the meaning
of the test against zero done later.

Fix this by using readq_relaxed() instead as it should be for
64bit quantities.
