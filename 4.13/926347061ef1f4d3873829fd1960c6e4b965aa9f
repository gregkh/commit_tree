target: break up free_device callback

With this patch free_device is now used to free what is allocated in the
alloc_device callback and destroy_device tears down the resources that are
setup in the configure_device callback.

This patch will be needed in the next patch where tcmu needs
to be able to look up the device in the destroy callback.
