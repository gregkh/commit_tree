ALSA: pcm: remove SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO internal command

Drivers can implement 'struct snd_pcm_ops.ioctl' to handle some requests
from ALSA PCM core. These requests are internal purpose in kernel land.
Usually common set of operations are used for it.

SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO is one of the requests. According to code comment,
it has been obsoleted in the old days.

We can see old releases in ftp.alsa-project.org. The command was firstly
introduced in v0.5.0 release as SND_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO, to allow drivers to
fill data of 'struct snd_pcm_channel_info' type. In v0.9.0 release,
this was obsoleted by the other commands for ioctl(2) such as
SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_CHANNEL_INFO.

This commit removes the long-abandoned command, bye.
