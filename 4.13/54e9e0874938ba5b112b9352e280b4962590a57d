net/wan/fsl_ucc_hdlc: call qe_setbrg only for loopback mode

We can't assume that we are always in loopback mode if rx and tx clock
have the same clock source. If we want to use HDLC busmode we also have
the same clock source but we are not in loopback mode. So move the
setting of the baudrate generator after the check for property for the
loopback mode.
