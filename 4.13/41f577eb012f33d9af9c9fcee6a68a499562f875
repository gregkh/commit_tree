powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Properly iterate through results

hv-24x7.h has a comment mentioning that result_buffer->results can't be
indexed as a normal array because it may contain results of variable sizes,
so fix the loop in h_24x7_event_commit_txn to take the variation into
account when iterating through results.

Another problem in that loop is that it sets h24x7hw->events[i] to NULL.
This assumes that only the i'th result maps to the i'th request, but that
is not guaranteed to be true. We need to leave the event in the array so
that we don't dereference a NULL pointer in case more than one result maps
to one request.

We still assume that each result has only one result element, so warn if
that assumption is violated.
