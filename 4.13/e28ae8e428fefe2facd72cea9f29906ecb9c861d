iomap: fix integer truncation issues in the zeroing and dirtying helpers

Fix the min_t calls in the zeroing and dirtying helpers to perform the
comparisms on 64-bit types, which prevents them from incorrectly
being truncated, and larger zeroing operations being stuck in a never
ending loop.

Special thanks to Markus Stockhausen for spotting the bug.
