staging: rtl8192e: Remove RX: IEEE802.1X EAPOL frame! warning.

RX will receive countless EAPOL frames over the life of the connection.

A number of conditional calls to rtllib_is_eapol_frame are made in this function.

So this call serves no purpose other than to spam logs with false warning that
it is indeed a EAPOL frame, remove it.
