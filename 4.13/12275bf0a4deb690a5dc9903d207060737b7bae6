iommu/arm-smmu-v3, acpi: Add temporary Cavium SMMU-V3 IORT model number definitions

The model number is already defined in acpica and we are actually
waiting for the acpi maintainers to include it:

 https://github.com/acpica/acpica/commit/d00a4eb86e64

Adding those temporary definitions until the change makes it into
include/acpi/actbl2.h. Once that is done this patch can be reverted.
