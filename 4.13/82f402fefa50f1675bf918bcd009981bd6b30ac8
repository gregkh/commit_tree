null_blk: add support for shared tags

Some storage drivers need to share tag sets between devices. It's
useful to be able to model that with null_blk, to find hangs or
performance issues.

Add a 'shared_tags' bool module parameter that. If that is set to
true and nr_devices is bigger than 1, all devices allocated will
share the same tag set.
