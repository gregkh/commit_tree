soc/tegra: bpmp: Update ABI header

Update the BPMP ABI header to a more recent version. The new version
adds support for a new powergating ABI as well as access to the ring
buffer console, which allows debug messages to be output to the BPMP
debug console.

Some of the previously undocumented fields have been documented and
missing bitmasks have been added. Furthermore the MRQ_RESET request
now has a sub-command that allows to determine the maximum ID which
in turn allows the resets to be enumerated, thereby allowing drivers
to become agnostic of the Tegra generation.
