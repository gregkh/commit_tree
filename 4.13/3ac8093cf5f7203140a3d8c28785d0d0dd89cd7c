arm64: defconfig: enable missing HWSPINLOCK

The hardware spinlock drivers now depend on HWSPINLOCK (instead of
selecting it), so we need to explicitly enable it after commit
35fc8a07d7f9 ("Make HWSPINLOCK a menuconfig to ease disabling")

Without HWSPINLOCK, various drivers are left with unsatisfied
dependencies and Qcom boards using shared memory based communication
to request regulators are failing to boot and mount rootfs.

Fix this by explicitly enabling HWSPINLOCK in defconfig.
