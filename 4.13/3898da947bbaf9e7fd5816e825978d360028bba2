KVM: avoid using rcu_dereference_protected

During teardown, accesses to memslots and buses are using
rcu_dereference_protected with an always-true condition because
these accesses are done outside the usual mutexes.  This
is because the last reference is gone and there cannot be any
concurrent modifications, but rcu_dereference_protected is
ugly and unobvious.

Instead, check the refcount in kvm_get_bus and __kvm_memslots.
