qed: Make VF legacy a bitfield

Until now we used to have a single VF legacy compatibility mode,
one that affected the place of the Rx producers of those VFs [mostly].

As PF would soon support allocating CIDs for VFs instead of having
a static CID<->queue configuration for them, we'll need to have
an additional legacy mode since existing VFs would need to continue
on using the older mode of operation.

Change the infrastrucutre so that the legacy would be able to indicate
which of the legacy behaviors is needed for a given VF.
