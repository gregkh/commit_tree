spi: imx: Revert "spi: imx: dynamic burst length adjust for PIO mode"

This reverts commits 8d4a6cad7adb3ddac32cd52635f20e11de11a658 and
179547e143e773f9f866ad3536275ab627711f3a.

Besides the problems already found with this patch it also modifies
the spi transfer tx_buf in spi_imx_u32_swap_u8() and spi_imx_u32_swap_u16().
This is hidden from the compiler with an explicit cast from const void*
to u32*, so no warning is issued.
