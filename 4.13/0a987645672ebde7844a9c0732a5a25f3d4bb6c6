um: Allow building and running on older hosts

Commit a78ff1112263 ("um: add extended processor state save/restore
support") and b6024b21fec8 ("um: extend fpstate to _xstate to support
YMM registers") forced the use of the x86 FP _xstate and
PTRACE_GETREGSET/SETREGSET. On older hosts, we would neither be able to
build UML nor run it anymore with these two commits applied because we
don't have definitions for struct _xstate nor these two ptrace requests.

We can determine at build time which fp context structure to check
against, just like we can keep using the old i387 fp save/restore if
PTRACE_GETRESET/SETREGSET are not defined.

Fixes: a78ff1112263 ("um: add extended processor state save/restore support")
Fixes: b6024b21fec8 ("um: extend fpstate to _xstate to support YMM registers")
