zorro.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Use right marks for titles;
- Use authorship marks;
- Mark literals and literal blocks;
- Use autonumbered list for references.
