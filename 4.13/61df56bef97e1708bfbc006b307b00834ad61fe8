I've 3 2-in-1 keyboard docks: Dell Venue Pro 11 keyboard dock,
HP pavilion x2 keyboard dock and a PEAQ C1010 keyboard dock which have
a wireless radio toggle hotkey, which uses the 0x000100c6 HUT code
defined in these extensions.

This commit adds a mapping for this key, this makes the rfkill toggle
hotkey work on the Dell Venue Pro 11 and HP Pavilion X2 keyboards,
the PEAQ C1010 keyboard does generate events for the 0x000100c6 HUT
code when pressed, but the reported value is always 0.
