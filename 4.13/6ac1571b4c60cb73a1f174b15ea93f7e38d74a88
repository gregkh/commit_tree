drm/tegra: dc: Avoid reset asserts on Tegra20

Commit 33a8eb8d40ee ("drm/tegra: dc: Implement runtime PM") introduced
HW reset control. It causes a hang on Tegra20 if both display
controllers are utilized (RGB panel and HDMI). The TRM suggests that
each display controller has its own reset control, apparently it is not
correct.
