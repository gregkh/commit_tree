thunderbolt: Add support for DMA configuration based mailbox

The DMA (NHI) port of a switch provides access to the NVM of the host
controller (and devices starting from Intel Alpine Ridge). The NVM
contains also more complete DROM for the root switch including vendor
and device identification strings.

This will look for the DMA port capability for each switch and if found
populates sw->dma_port. We then teach tb_drom_read() to read the DROM
information from NVM if available for the root switch.

The DMA port capability also supports upgrading the NVM for both host
controller and devices which will be added in subsequent patches.

This code is based on the work done by Amir Levy and Michael Jamet.
