btrfs: fix integer overflow in calc_reclaim_items_nr

Dave Jones hit a WARN_ON(nr < 0) in btrfs_wait_ordered_roots() with
v4.12-rc6.  This was because commit 70e7af244 made it possible for
calc_reclaim_items_nr() to return a negative number.  It's not really a
bug in that commit, it just didn't go far enough down the stack to find
all the possible 64->32 bit overflows.

This switches calc_reclaim_items_nr() to return a u64 and changes everyone
that uses the results of that math to u64 as well.
