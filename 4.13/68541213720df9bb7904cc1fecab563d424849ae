ALSA: pcm: Direct in-kernel read/write support

Now all materials are ready, let's allow the direct in-kernel
read/write, i.e. a kernel-space buffer is passed for read or write,
instead of the normal user-space buffer.  This feature is used by OSS
layer and UAC1 driver, for example.

The __snd_pcm_lib_xfer() takes in_kernel argument that indicates the
in-kernel buffer copy.  When this flag is set, another transfer code
is used.  It's either via copy_kernel PCM ops or the normal memcpy(),
depending on the driver setup.

As external API, snd_pcm_kernel_read(), *_write() and other variants
are provided.

That's all.  This support is really simple because of the code
refactoring until now.
