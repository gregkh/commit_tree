ipc/sem: avoid ipc_rcu_alloc()

Instead of using ipc_rcu_alloc() which only performs the refcount bump,
open code it to perform better sem-specific checks.  This also allows
for sem_array structure layout to be randomized in the future.

[manfred@colorfullife.com: Rediff, because the memset was temporarily inside ipc_rcu_alloc()]
