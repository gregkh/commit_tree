NTB: Add indexed ports NTB API

There is some NTB hardware, which can combine more than just two domains
over NTB. For instance, some IDT PCIe-switches can have NTB-functions
activated on more than two-ports. The different domains are distinguished
by ports they are connected to. So the new port-related methods are added to
the NTB API:
 ntb_port_number() - return local port
 ntb_peer_port_count() - return number of peers local port can connect to
 ntb_peer_port_number(pdix) - return port number by it index
 ntb_peer_port_idx(port) - return port index by it number

Current test-drivers aren't changed much. They still support two-ports devices
for the time being while multi-ports hardware drivers aren't added.

By default port-related API is declared for two-ports hardware.
So corresponding hardware drivers won't need to implement it.
