apparmor: convert to profile block critical sections

There are still a few places where profile replacement fails to update
and a stale profile is used for mediation. Fix this by moving to
accessing the current label through a critical section that will
always ensure mediation is using the current label regardless of
whether the tasks cred has been updated or not.
