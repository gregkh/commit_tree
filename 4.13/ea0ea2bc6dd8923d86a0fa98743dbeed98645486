blk-throttle: cap discard request size

discard request usually is very big and easily use all bandwidth budget
of a cgroup. discard request size doesn't really mean the size of data
written, so it doesn't make sense to account it into bandwidth budget.
Jens pointed out treating the size 0 doesn't make sense too, because
discard request does have cost. But it's not easy to find the actual
cost. This patch simply makes the size one sector.
