netpoll: shut up a kernel warning on refcount

When we convert atomic_t to refcount_t, a new kernel warning
on "increment on 0" is introduced in the netpoll code,
zap_completion_queue(). In fact for this special case, we know
the refcount is 0 and we just have to set it to 1 to satisfy
the following dev_kfree_skb_any(), so we can just use
refcount_set(..., 1) instead.
