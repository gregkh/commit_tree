gpio: acpi: Even more tighten up ACPI GPIO lookups

The commit 10cf4899f8af ("gpiolib: tighten up ACPI legacy gpio lookups")
prevents to getting same resource twice if the driver asks twice using
different connection ID.

But the whole idea of fallback might bring some problems. Imagine the case when
we have two versions of BIOS/hardware where in one _DSD is introduced along
with GPIO resources, but the other one uses just plain GPIO resource for
another purpose

Case 1:

    Device (DEVX)
    {
        ...
        Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate ()
        {
            GpioIo (Exclusive, PullUp, 0, 0, IoRestrictionInputOnly,
                    "\\_SB.GPO0", 0, ResourceConsumer) {15}
        })
        Name (_DSD, Package ()
        {
            ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
            Package ()
            {
                Package () {"some-gpios", Package() {^DEVX, 0, 0, 0 }},
            }
        })
    }

Case 2:

    Device (DEVX)
    {
        ...
        Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate ()
        {
            GpioIo (Exclusive, PullUp, 0, 0, IoRestrictionInputOnly,
                    "\\_SB.GPO0", 0, ResourceConsumer) {27}
        })
    }

To prevent the possible misconfiguration tighten up even more GPIO ACPI lookups
for case without connection ID provided.

In the past the issue had been triggered by "use mctrl_gpio helpers" series
[1,2].
