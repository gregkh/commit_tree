block: add support for write hints in a bio

No functional changes in this patch, we just use up some holes
in the bio and request structures to define a write hint that
we psas down the stack.

Ensure that we don't merge requests that have different life time
hints assigned to them, and that we inherit the write hint when
cloning a bio.
