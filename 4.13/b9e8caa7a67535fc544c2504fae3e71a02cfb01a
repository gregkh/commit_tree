staging: fusb302: don't bitshift __le16 type

The header field in struct pd_message is declared as an __le16 type. The
data in the message is supposed to be little endian. This means we don't
have to go and shift the individual bytes into position when we're
filling the buffer, we can just copy the contents right away. As an
added benefit we don't get fishy results on big endian systems anymore.
