xen/vcpu: Simplify xen_vcpu related code

Largely mechanical changes to aid unification of xen_vcpu_restore()
logic for PV, PVH and PVHVM.

xen_vcpu_setup(): the only change in logic is that clamp_max_cpus()
is now handled inside the "if (!xen_have_vcpu_info_placement)" block.

xen_vcpu_restore(): code movement from enlighten_pv.c to enlighten.c.

xen_vcpu_info_reset(): pulls together all the code where xen_vcpu
is set to default.
