net: fix compilation when busy poll is not enabled

MIN_NAPI_ID is used in various places outside of
CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL wrapping, so when it's not set
we run into build errors such as:

  net/core/dev.c: In function 'dev_get_by_napi_id':
  net/core/dev.c:886:16: error: ‘MIN_NAPI_ID’ undeclared (first use in this function)
    if (napi_id < MIN_NAPI_ID)
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~

Thus, have MIN_NAPI_ID always defined to fix these errors.
