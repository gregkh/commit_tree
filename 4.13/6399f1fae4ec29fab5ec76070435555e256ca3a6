ipv6: avoid overflow of offset in ip6_find_1stfragopt

In some cases, offset can overflow and can cause an infinite loop in
ip6_find_1stfragopt(). Make it unsigned int to prevent the overflow, and
cap it at IPV6_MAXPLEN, since packets larger than that should be invalid.

This problem has been here since before the beginning of git history.
