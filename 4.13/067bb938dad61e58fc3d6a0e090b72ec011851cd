net/wan/fsl_ucc_hdlc: add hdlc-bus support

This adds support for hdlc-bus mode to the fsl_ucc_hdlc driver. This can
be enabled with the "fsl,hdlc-bus" property in the DTS node of the
corresponding ucc.

This aligns the configuration of the UPSMR and GUMR registers to what is
done in our ucc_hdlc driver (that only support hdlc-bus mode) and with
the QuickEngine's documentation for hdlc-bus mode.

GUMR/SYNL is set to AUTO for the busmode as in this case the CD signal
is ignored. The brkpt_support is enabled to set the HBM1 bit in the
CMXUCR register to configure an open-drain connected HDLC bus.
