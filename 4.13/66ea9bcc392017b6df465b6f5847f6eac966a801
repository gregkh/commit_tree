scsi: cxlflash: Combine the send queue locks

Currently there are separate spin locks for the two supported I/O queueing
models. This makes it difficult to serialize with paths outside the enqueue
path.

As a design simplification and to support serialization with enqueue
operations, move to only a single lock that is used for enqueueing
regardless of the queueing model.
