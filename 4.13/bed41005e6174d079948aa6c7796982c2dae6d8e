drm/pl111: Initial drm/kms driver for pl111

This is a modesetting driver for the pl111 CLCD display controller
found on various ARM platforms such as the Versatile Express. The
driver has only been tested on the bcm911360_entphn platform so far,
with PRIME-based buffer sharing between vc4 and clcd.

It reuses the existing devicetree binding, while not using quite as
many of its properties as the fbdev driver does (those are left for
future work).

v2: Nearly complete rewrite by anholt, cutting 2/3 of the code thanks
    to DRM core's excellent new helpers.
v3: Don't match pl110 any more, don't attach if we don't have a DRM
    panel, use DRM_GEM_CMA_FOPS, update MAINTAINERS, use the simple
    display helper, use drm_gem_cma_dumb_create (same as our wrapper).
v4: Change the driver's .name to not clash with fbdev in sysfs, drop
    platform alias, drop redundant "drm" in DRM driver name, hook up
    .prepare_fb to the CMA helper so that DMA fences should work.
v5: Move register definitions inside the driver directory, fix build
    in COMPILE_TEST and !AMBA mode.
v6: Drop TIM2_CLKSEL for now to be consistent with existing DT
    bindings, switch back to external register definitions.
