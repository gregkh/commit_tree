selftests/ftrace: Update multiple kprobes test for powerpc

KPROBES_ON_FTRACE is only available on powerpc64le. Update comment to
clarify this.

Also, we should use an offset of 8 to ensure that the probe does not
fall on ftrace location. The current offset of 4 will fall before the
function local entry point and won't fire, while an offset of 12 or 16
will fall on ftrace location. Offset 8 is currently guaranteed to not be
the ftrace location.
