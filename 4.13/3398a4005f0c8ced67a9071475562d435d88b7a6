xfs: remove XFS_HSIZE

XFS_HSIZE is an extremly confusing way to calculate the size of handle_t.
Given that handle_t always only had two sizes, and one of them isn't
even covered by XFS_HSIZE to start with just remove the macro and use
a constant sizeof expression.

Note that XFS_HSIZE isn't used in xfsprogs, xfsdump or xfstests either.
