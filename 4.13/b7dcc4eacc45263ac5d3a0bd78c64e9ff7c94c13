clocksource/drivers: Fix uninitialized variable use in timer_of_init

If none of the flags are set, 'ret' is uninitialized as pointed out
by gcc:

drivers/clocksource/timer-of.c: In function 'timer_of_init':
drivers/clocksource/timer-of.c:160:9: error: 'ret' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Since calling the function without any of the flags is an error,
set the return value to -EINVAL for that case.

[ tglx: Get rid of the silly backwards goto while at it ]
