xfs: check if an inode is cached and allocated

Check the inode cache for a particular inode number.  If it's in the
cache, check that it's not currently being reclaimed.  If it's not being
reclaimed, return zero if the inode is allocated.  This function will be
used by various scrubbers to decide if the cache is more up to date
than the disk in terms of checking if an inode is allocated.
