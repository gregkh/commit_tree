i40e: check for Tx timestamp timeouts during watchdog

The i40e driver has logic to handle only one Tx timestamp at a time,
using a state bit lock to avoid multiple requests at once.

It may be possible, if incredibly unlikely, that a Tx timestamp event is
requested but never completes. Since we use an interrupt scheme to
determine when the Tx timestamp occurred we would never clear the state
bit in this case.

Add an i40e_ptp_tx_hang() function similar to the already existing
i40e_ptp_rx_hang() function. This function runs in the watchdog routine
and makes sure we eventually recover from this case instead of
permanently disabling Tx timestamps.

Note: there is no currently known way to cause this without hacking the
driver code to force it.
