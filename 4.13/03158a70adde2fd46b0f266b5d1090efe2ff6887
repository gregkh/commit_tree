DMA-API.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Fix some title marks to match ReST;
- use :Author: for author name;
- foo_ is an hyperlink. Get rid of it;
- Mark literal blocks as such;
- Use tables on some places that are almost using the
  table format.
