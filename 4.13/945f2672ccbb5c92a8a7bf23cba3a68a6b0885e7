drm/i915/cnl: Implement .get_display_clock_speed() for CNL

Add support for reading out the cdclk frequency from the hardware on
CNL. Very similar to BXT, with a few new twists and turns:
* the PLL is now called CDCLK PLL, not DE PLL
* reference clock can be 24 MHz in addition to the 19.2 MHz BXT had
* the ratio now lives in the PLL enable register
* Only 1x and 2x CD2X dividers are supported

v2: Deal with PLL lock bit the same way as BXT/SKL do now
v3: DSSM refclk indicator is bit 31 not 24 (Ander)
v4: Rebased by Rodrigo after Ville's cdclk rework.
v5: Set cdclk to the ref clock as previous platforms. (Imre)
