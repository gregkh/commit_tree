amd-xgbe: Re-issue interrupt if interrupt status not cleared

Some of the device interrupts should function as level interrupts. For
some hardware configurations this requires setting some control bits
so that if the interrupt status has not been cleared the interrupt
should be reissued.

Additionally, when using MSI or MSI-X interrupts, run the interrupt
service routine as a tasklet so that the re-issuance of the interrupt
is handled properly.
