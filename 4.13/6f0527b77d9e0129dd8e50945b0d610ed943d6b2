ACPICA: Disassembler: Abort on an invalid/unknown AML opcode

ACPICA commit ed0389cb11a61e63c568ac1f67948fc6a7bd1aeb

An invalid opcode indicates something seriously wrong with the
input AML file. The AML parser is immediately confused and lost,
causing the resulting parse tree to be ill-formed. The actual
disassembly can then cause numerous unrelated errors and faults.

This change aborts the disassembly upon discovery of such an
opcode during the AML parse phase.
