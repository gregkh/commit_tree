drm/i915/skl+: Perform wm level calculations in separate function

Instead of iterating over planes & wm levels in a single function use
skl_compute_wm_level function to interate over WM levels.
Change name of function to skl_compute_wm_levels (Matt).

These changes are to clean-up WM code & will help in making only new
ddb algorithm related changes in later patch in series.
