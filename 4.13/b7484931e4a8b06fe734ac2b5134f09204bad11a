KVM: arm/arm64: PMU: remove request-less vcpu kick

Refactor PMU overflow handling in order to remove the request-less
vcpu kick.  Now, since kvm_vgic_inject_irq() uses vcpu requests,
there should be no chance that a kick sent at just the wrong time
(between the VCPU's call to kvm_pmu_flush_hwstate() and before it
enters guest mode) results in a failure for the guest to see updated
GIC state until its next exit some time later for some other reason.
