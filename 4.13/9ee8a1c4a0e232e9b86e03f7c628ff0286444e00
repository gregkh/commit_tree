PCI: Remove pci_scan_root_bus_msi()

The pci_scan_root_bus_bridge() function allows passing a parameterized
struct pci_host_bridge and scanning the resulting PCI bus; since the struct
msi_controller is part of the struct pci_host_bridge and the struct
pci_host_bridge can now be passed to pci_scan_root_bus_bridge() explicitly,
there is no need for a scan interface with a MSI controller parameter.

With all PCI host controller drivers and platform code relying on
pci_scan_root_bus_msi() converted over to pci_scan_root_bus_bridge() the
pci_scan_root_bus_msi() becomes obsolete and can be removed.
