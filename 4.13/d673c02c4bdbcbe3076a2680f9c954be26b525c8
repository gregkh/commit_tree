drm/vblank: Switch drm_driver->get_vblank_timestamp to return a bool

There's really no reason for anything more:
- Calling this while the crtc vblank stuff isn't set up is a driver
  bug. Those places alrready DRM_ERROR.
- Calling this when the crtc is off is either a driver bug (calling
  drm_crtc_handle_vblank at the wrong time) or a core bug (for
  anything else). Again, we DRM_ERROR.
- EINVAL is checked at higher levels already, and if we'd use struct
  drm_crtc * instead of (dev, pipe) it would be real obvious that
  those are again core bugs.

The only valid failure mode is crap hardware that couldn't sample a
useful timestamp, to ask the core to just grab a not-so-accurate
timestamp. Bool is perfectly fine for that.

v2: Also fix up the one caller, I lost that in the shuffling (Jani).

v3: Fixup commit message (Neil).
