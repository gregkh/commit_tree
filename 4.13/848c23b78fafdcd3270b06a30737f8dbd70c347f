btrfs: Remove false alert when fiemap range is smaller than on-disk extent

Commit 4751832da990 ("btrfs: fiemap: Cache and merge fiemap extent before
submit it to user") introduced a warning to catch unemitted cached
fiemap extent.

However such warning doesn't take the following case into consideration:

0			4K			8K
|<---- fiemap range --->|
|<----------- On-disk extent ------------------>|

In this case, the whole 0~8K is cached, and since it's larger than
fiemap range, it break the fiemap extent emit loop.
This leaves the fiemap extent cached but not emitted, and caught by the
final fiemap extent sanity check, causing kernel warning.

This patch removes the kernel warning and renames the sanity check to
emit_last_fiemap_cache() since it's possible and valid to have cached
fiemap extent.
