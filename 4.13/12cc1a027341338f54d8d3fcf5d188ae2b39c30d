IB/mlx5: Clean mr_cache debugfs in case of failure

The failure in creation of debugfs entries for mr_cache left entries,
which were already created.

It caused to mismatch and misguiding for the end users. The solution
is to clean mr_cache debugfs root, so no leftovers will be in the
system. In addition, let's document why the error is not needed to be
forwarded to user in case of failure.
