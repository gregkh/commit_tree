mm/page_alloc.c: eliminate unsigned confusion in __rmqueue_fallback

Since current_order starts as MAX_ORDER-1 and is then only decremented,
the second half of the loop condition seems superfluous.  However, if
order is 0, we may decrement current_order past 0, making it UINT_MAX.
This is obviously too subtle ([1], [2]).

Since we need to add some comment anyway, change the two variables to
signed, making the counting-down for loop look more familiar, and
apparently also making gcc generate slightly smaller code.
