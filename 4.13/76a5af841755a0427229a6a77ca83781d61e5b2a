nvme: explicitly disable APST on quirked devices

A user reports APST is enabled, even when the NVMe is quirked or with
option "default_ps_max_latency_us=0".

The current logic will not set APST if the device is quirked. But the
NVMe in question will enable APST automatically.

Separate the logic "apst is supported" and "to enable apst", so we can
use the latter one to explicitly disable APST at initialiaztion.
