iio: adc: cpcap: Remove hung interrupt quirk

This is no longer needed as the real problem was interrupt flags
not getting passed properly from device tree to the cpcap-core.c
mfd driver. This got fixed with commit ac89473213c6 ("mfd: cpcap:
Fix interrupt to use level interrupt") So let's remove ADC
interrupt specific the quirk.
