HID: apple: Use country code to detect ISO keyboards

At least on newer laptops, Apple uses the same USB ID for both ISO and
ANSI keyboards. However, they have been good about filling in the
bCountryCode field in the HID descriptor on all of their keyboards. A
value of 13 indicates an ISO layout and other values indicate various
country-specific ANSI layouts.

With this patch, users of Apple US keyboards will no longer have to run
`echo 0 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout` to get a working
tilde key.

Please test this patch and send feedback if you have a Macbook or an
Apple keyboard.
