arm64: signal: Refactor sigcontext parsing in rt_sigreturn

Currently, rt_sigreturn does very limited checking on the
sigcontext coming from userspace.

Future additions to the sigcontext data will increase the potential
for surprises.  Also, it is not clear whether the sigcontext
extension records are supposed to occur in a particular order.

To allow the parsing code to be extended more easily, this patch
factors out the sigcontext parsing into a separate function, and
adds extra checks to validate the well-formedness of the sigcontext
structure.
