arm64: allwinner: h5: sort the device nodes in / part for some boards

The reg_vcc3v3 node is wrongly placed at the start of the / part, but
not with other fixed regulators used by the board, which makes the
device nodes unsorted.

As Orange Pi Prime and Nano Pi NEO2 device trees are copy'n'paste works,
they share the device node unsorted issue.

Fix this by move reg_vcc3v3 node to the position before reg_usb0_vbus.
