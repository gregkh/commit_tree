scsi: sas: scsi_queue_work can fail, so make callers aware

libsas uses scsi_queue_work() to queue its internal event notifications.
scsi_queue_work() can return -EINVAL if the work queue doesn't exist and
it does call queue_work() which can return false if the work is already
queued.

Make the SAS event code capable of returning errors up to the caller,
which is handy when changing to dynamically allocated work in libsas
as well, as discussed here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/6/14/121.
