Revert "xfs: grab dquots without taking the ilock"

This reverts commit 50e0bdbe9f48f98bb02eac7030d682f4716884ae.

The new XFS_QMOPT_NOLOCK isn't used at all, and conditional locking based
on a flag is always the wrong thing to do - we should be having helpers
that can be called without the lock instead.
