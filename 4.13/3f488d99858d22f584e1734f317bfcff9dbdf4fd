drm/i915/perf: rework mux configurations queries

Gen8+ might have mux configurations per slices/subslices. Depending on
whether slices/subslices have been fused off, only part of the
configuration needs to be applied. This change reworks the mux
configurations query mechanism to allow more than one set of registers
to be programmed.
