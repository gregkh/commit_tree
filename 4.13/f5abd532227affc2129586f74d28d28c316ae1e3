ALSA: pcm: use %s instead of %c for format of PCM buffer tracepoints

As long as I know, in userspace, '%c' format on printing format for
tracepoint is replaced with '>c<' by existent tracing program; i.g.
'perf-trace' and 'trace-cmd'. This is inconvenient.

This commit replaces the format with '%s'. The length of letters in the
format string is not changed, thus this commit doesn't increase object
size.

In theory, I should work for improvements of these tracing programs, but
here I'd like to save my time to work for the other projects.
