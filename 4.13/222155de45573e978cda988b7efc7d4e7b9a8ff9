usb: gadget: function: f_fs: Let ffs_epfile_ioctl wait for enable.

This allows users to make an ioctl call as the first action on a
connection. Ex, some functions might want to get endpoint size
before making any i/os.

Previously, calling ioctls before read/write would depending on the
timing of endpoints being enabled.

ESHUTDOWN is now a possible return value and ENODEV is not, so change
docs accordingly.
