rcutorture: Add three-level tree test for Tree SRCU

This commit adds a test for a three-level srcu_node tree for Tree SRCU
in the existing SRCU-P scenario.  This requires enabling CONFIG_RCU_EXPERT,
so the CONFIG_RCU_EXPERT=n scenario is now SRCU-N.  The reason for using
SRCU-P for the tall tree is that preemption raises the possibility of
locating more bugs than does the non-preemptive SRCU-N.
