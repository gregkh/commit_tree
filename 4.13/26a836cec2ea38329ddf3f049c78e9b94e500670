btrfs: Check name_len on add_inode_ref call path

replay_one_buffer first reads buffers and dispatches items accroding to
the item type.
In this patch, add_inode_ref handles inode_ref and inode_extref.
Then add_inode_ref calls ref_get_fields and extref_get_fields to read
ref/extref name for the first time.
So checking name_len before reading those two is fine.

add_inode_ref also calls inode_in_dir to match ref/extref in parent_dir.
The call graph includes btrfs_match_dir_item_name to read dir_item name
in the parent dir.
Checking first dir_item is not enough. Change it to verify every
dir_item while doing matches.
