drm/i915/glk: Fix DSI "*ERROR* ULPS is still active" messages

The sequence in glk_dsi_device_ready() enters ULPS then waits until it is
*not* active to then disable it. The correct sequence according to the
spec is to enter ULPS then wait until the GLK_ULPS_NOT_ACTIVE bit is
zero, i.e., ULPS is active, and then disable ULPS.

Fixing the condition gets rid of the following spurious error messages:

[drm:glk_dsi_device_ready [i915]] *ERROR* ULPS is still active
