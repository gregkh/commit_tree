s390/mm: remove incorrect _REGION3_ENTRY_ORIGIN define

_REGION3_ENTRY_ORIGIN defines a wrong mask which can be used to
extract a segment table origin from a region 3 table entry. It removes
only the lower 11 instead of 12 bits from a region 3 table entry.
Luckily this bit is currently always zero, so nothing bad happened yet.

In order to avoid future bugs just remove the region 3 specific mask
and use the correct generic _REGION_ENTRY_ORIGIN mask.
