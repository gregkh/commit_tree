Btrfs: tolerate errors if we have retried successfully

With raid1 profile, dio read isn't tolerating IO errors if read length is
less than the stripe length (64K).

Our bio didn't get split in btrfs_submit_direct_hook() if (dip->flags &
BTRFS_DIO_ORIG_BIO_SUBMITTED) is true and that happens when the read
length is less than 64k.  In this case, if the underlying device returns
error somehow, bio->bi_error has recorded that error.

If we could recover the correct data from another copy in profile raid1/10/5/6,
with btrfs_subio_endio_read() returning 0, bio would have the correct data in
its vector, but bio->bi_error is not updated accordingly so that the following
dio_end_io(dio_bio, bio->bi_error) makes directIO think this read has failed.

This fixes the problem by setting bio's error to 0 if a good copy has been
found.
