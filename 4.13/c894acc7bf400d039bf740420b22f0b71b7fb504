iio: hid-sensor: fix return of -EINVAL on invalid values in ret or value

Ensure that when an invalid value in ret or value is found -EINVAL
is returned. A previous commit broke the way the return error is
being returned and instead caused the return code in ret to be
re-assigned rather than be returned.
