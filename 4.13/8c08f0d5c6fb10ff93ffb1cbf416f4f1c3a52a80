ftrace: Have cached module filters be an active filter

When a module filter is added to set_ftrace_filter, if the module is not
loaded, it is cached. This should be considered an active filter, and
function tracing should be filtered by this. That is, if a cached module
filter is the only filter set, then no function tracing should be happening,
as all the functions available will be filtered out.

This makes sense, as the reason to add a cached module filter, is to trace
the module when you load it. There shouldn't be any other tracing happening
until then.
