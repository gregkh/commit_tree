powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Minor improvements

There's an H24x7_DATA_BUFFER_SIZE constant, so use it in init_24x7_request.

There's also an HV_PERF_DOMAIN_MAX constant, so use it in
h_24x7_event_init. This makes the comment above the check redundant,
so remove it.

In add_event_to_24x7_request, a statement is terminated with a comma
instead of a semicolon. Fix it.

In hv-24x7.h, improve comments in struct hv_24x7_result.
