[media] media drivers: annotate fall-through

Avoid warnings like those:

drivers/media/pci/ddbridge/ddbridge-core.c: In function 'dvb_input_detach':
drivers/media/pci/ddbridge/ddbridge-core.c:787:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
   if (input->fe) {
      ^
drivers/media/pci/ddbridge/ddbridge-core.c:792:2: note: here
  case 4:
  ^~~~
...

On several cases, it is just that gcc 7.1 is not capable of
understanding the comment, but on other places, we need an
annotation.
