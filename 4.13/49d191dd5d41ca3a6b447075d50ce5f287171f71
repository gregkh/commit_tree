drm/i915: Drop AUX backlight enable check for backlight control

There are some panel that
(1) does not support display backlight enable via AUX
(2) support display backlight adjustment via AUX
(3) support display backlight enable via eDP BL_ENABLE pin

The current driver required that (1) must be support to enable (2).
This patch drops that requirement.
