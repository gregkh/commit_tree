ARM: dts: augment Moxa and Aspeed DTS for FTTMR010

This augments the Moxa Art and Aspeed device trees to:

- Explicitly name the clock "PCLK" as the Faraday FTTMR010
  names it.
- List the Moxa timer as compatible with the Faradat FTTMR010
  vanilla version.
- Add a comment that the Aspeed driver is a Faraday
  FTTMR010 derivative.
- Pass all IRQs to the timer from Aspeed: they are all there
  so they should be in the device tree, we only use the
  first one anyways.
