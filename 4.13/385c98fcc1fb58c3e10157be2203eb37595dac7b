clocksource/drivers/fttmr010: Implement delay timer

This timer is often used on the ARM architecture, so as with so
many siblings, we can implement delay timers, removing the need
for the system to calibrate jiffys at boot, and potentially
handling CPU frequency scaling on targets.

We cannot just protect the Kconfig with a "depends on ARM" because
it is already known that different architectures are using Faraday
IP blocks, so it is better to make things open-ended and use

Result on boot dmesg:

Switching to timer-based delay loop, resolution 40n
Calibrating delay loop (skipped), value calculated using
  timer frequency.. 50.00 BogoMIPS (lpj=250000)

This is accurately the timer frequency, 250MHz on the APB
bus.
