powerpc/64s: Move system_call() symbol to just after setting MSR_EE

It is common to get a PMU interrupt right after the mtmsr instruction that
enables interrupts. Due to this, the stack trace profile gets needlessly split
across system_call_common() and system_call().

Previously, system_call() symbol was at the current place to hide a few
earlier symbols which have since been made private or removed entirely.

So, let's move system_call() slightly higher up, right after the mtmsr
instruction that enables interrupts. Convert existing references to
system_call to a local syscall symbol.
