MIPS: cmpxchg: Use __compiletime_error() for bad cmpxchg() pointers

Our cmpxchg() implementation relies upon generating a call to a function
which doesn't really exist (__cmpxchg_called_with_bad_pointer) to create
a link failure in cases where cmpxchg() is called with a pointer to a
value of an unsupported size.

The __compiletime_error macro can be used to decorate a function such
that a call to it generates a compile-time, rather than a link-time,
error. This patch uses __compiletime_error to cause bad cmpxchg() calls
to error out at compile time rather than link time, allowing errors to
occur more quickly & making it easier to spot where the problem comes
from.
