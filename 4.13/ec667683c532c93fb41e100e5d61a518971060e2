Input: trackpoint - add new trackpoint firmware ID

Synaptics add new TP firmware ID: 0x2 and 0x3, for now both lower 2 bits
are indicated as TP. Change the constant to bitwise values.

This makes trackpoint to be recognized on Lenovo Carbon X1 Gen5 instead
of it being identified as "PS/2 Generic Mouse".
