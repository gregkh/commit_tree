[media] rc-core: cleanup rc_register_device pt2

Now that rc_register_device() is reorganised, the dev->initialized
hack can be removed. Any driver which calls rc_register_device()
must be prepared for the device to go live immediately.

The dev->initialized commits that are relevant are commit c73bbaa4ec3e
("[media] rc-core: don't lock device at rc_register_device()") and
commit 08aeb7c9a42a ("[media] rc: add locking to fix register/show race").

The original problem was that show_protocols() would access
dev->rc_map.* and various other bits which are now properly
initialized before device_add() is called.

At the same time, remove the bogus "device is being removed" check.
