drm/i915/fbdev: Check for existence of ifbdev->vma before operations

Commit fabef825626d ("drm/i915: Drop struct_mutex around frontbuffer
flushes") adds a dependency to ifbdev->vma when flushing the framebufer,
but the checks are only against the existence of the ifbdev->fb and not
against ifbdev->vma. This leaves a window of opportunity where we may
try to operate on the fbdev prior to it being probed (thanks to
asynchronous booting).
