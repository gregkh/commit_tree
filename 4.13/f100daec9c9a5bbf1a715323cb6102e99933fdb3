drm/i915/gvt: Trigger scheduling after context complete

The time based scheduler poll context busy status at every
micro-second during vGPU switch, it will make GPU idle for a while
when the context is very small and completed before the next
micro-second arrival. Trigger scheduling immediately after context
complete will eliminate GPU idle and improve performance.

Create two vGPU with same type, run Heaven simultaneously:
Before this patch:
 +---------+----------+----------+
 |         |  vGPU1   |   vGPU2  |
 +---------+----------+----------+
 |  Heaven |  357     |    354   |
 +-------------------------------+

After this patch:
 +---------+----------+----------+
 |         |  vGPU1   |   vGPU2  |
 +---------+----------+----------+
 |  Heaven |  397     |    398   |
 +-------------------------------+
