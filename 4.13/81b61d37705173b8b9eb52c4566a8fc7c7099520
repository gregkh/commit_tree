ARM: dts: rockchip: enable usb for rk3229 evb board

Rockchip's rk3229 evaluation board has one usb otg controller
and three usb host controllers. Each usb controller connect
with one usb2 phy port through UTMI+ interface. And the three
usb host interfaces use the same GPIO VBUS drive. Let's enable
them to support usb on rk3229 evb board.
