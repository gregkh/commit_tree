thunderbolt: Move control channel messages to tb_msgs.h

We will be forwarding notifications received from the control channel to
the connection manager implementations. This way they can decide what to
do if anything when a notification is received.

To be able to use control channel messages from other files, move them
to tb_msgs.h.

No functional changes intended.
