lockdep: Use consistent printing primitives

Commit a5dd63efda3d ("lockdep: Use "WARNING" tag on lockdep splats")
substituted pr_warn() for printk() in places called out by Dmitry Vyukov.
However, this resulted in an ugly mix of pr_warn() and printk().  This
commit therefore changes printk() to pr_warn() or pr_cont(), depending
on the absence or presence of KERN_CONT.  This is done in all functions
that had printk() changed to pr_warn() by the aforementioned commit.
