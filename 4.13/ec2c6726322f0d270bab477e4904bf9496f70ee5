s390/qeth: fix L3 next-hop in xmit qeth hdr

On L3, the qeth_hdr struct needs to be filled with the next-hop
IP address.
The current code accesses rtable->rt_gateway without checking that
rtable is a valid address. The accidental access to a lowcore area
results in a random next-hop address in the qeth_hdr.
rtable (or more precisely, skb_dst(skb)) can be NULL in rare cases
(for instance together with AF_PACKET sockets).
This patch adds the missing NULL-ptr checks.
