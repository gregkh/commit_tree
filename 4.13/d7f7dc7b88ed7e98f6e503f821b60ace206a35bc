x86/microcode: Make a couple of symbols static

The helper function __load_ucode_amd() and pointer intel_ucode_patch do
not need to be in global scope, so make them static.

Fixes those sparse warnings:
"symbol '__load_ucode_amd' was not declared. Should it be static?"
"symbol 'intel_ucode_patch' was not declared. Should it be static?"
