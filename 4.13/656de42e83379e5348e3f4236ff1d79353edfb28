pstore: Avoid potential infinite loop

If a backend does not correctly iterate through its records, pstore will
get stuck loading entries. Detect this with a large record count, and
announce if we ever hit the limit. This will let future backend reading
bugs less annoying to debug. Additionally adjust the error about
pstore_mkfile() failing.
