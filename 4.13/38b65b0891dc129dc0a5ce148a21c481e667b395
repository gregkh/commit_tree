perf intel-pt: Do not use TSC packets for calculating CPU cycles to TSC

CBR (core-to-bus ratio) packets provide an indication of CPU frequency. A
more accurate measure can be made by counting the cycles (given by CYC
packets) in between other timing packets (either MTC or TSC). Using TSC
packets has at least 2 issues: 1) timing might have stopped (e.g. mwait) or
2) TSC packets within PSB+ might slip past CYC packets. For now, simply do
not use TSC packets for calculating CPU cycles to TSC. That leaves the case
where 2 MTC packets are used, otherwise falling back to the CBR value.
