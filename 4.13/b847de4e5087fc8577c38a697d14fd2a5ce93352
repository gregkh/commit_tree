iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Increase CMDQ drain timeout value

Waiting for a CMD_SYNC to be processed involves waiting for the command
queue to drain, which can take an awful lot longer than waiting for a
single entry to become available. Consequently, the common timeout value
of 100us has been observed to be too short on some platforms when a
CMD_SYNC is issued into a queued full of TLBI commands.

This patch resolves the issue by using a different (1s) timeout when
waiting for the CMDQ to drain and using a simple back-off mechanism
when polling the cons pointer in the absence of WFE support.
