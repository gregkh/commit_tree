um: add dummy ioremap and iounmap functions

The user mode architecture does not provide ioremap or iounmap, and
because of this, the arch won't build when the functions are used in some
core libraries.

I have designs to use these functions in scatterlist.c where they'd
almost certainly never be called on the um architecture but it does need
to compile.
