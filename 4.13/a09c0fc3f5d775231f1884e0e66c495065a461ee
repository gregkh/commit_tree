ixgbe: pci_set_drvdata must be called before register_netdev

We call pci_set_drvdata immediately after calling register_netdev,
which leaves a window where tasks writing to the sriov_numvfs sysfs
attribute can sneak in and crash the kernel.  register_netdev cleans
up after itself so placing pci_set_drvdata immediately before it
should preserve the intent of commit 0fb6a55cc31f ("ixgbe: fix crash
on rmmod after probe fail").
