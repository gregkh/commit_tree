dm mpath: do not lock up a CPU with requeuing activity

When using the block layer in single queue mode, get_request()
returns ERR_PTR(-EAGAIN) if the queue is dying and the REQ_NOWAIT
flag has been passed to get_request(). Avoid that the kernel
reports soft lockup complaints in this case due to continuous
requeuing activity.
