parse-maintainers: Move matching sections from MAINTAINERS

Allow any number of command line arguments to match either the
section header or the section contents and create new files.

Create MAINTAINERS.new and SECTION.new.

This allows scripting of the movement of various sections from
MAINTAINERS.
