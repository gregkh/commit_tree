xen/scsiback: Make TMF processing slightly faster

Target drivers must guarantee that struct se_cmd and struct se_tmr_req
exist as long as target_tmr_work() is in progress. Since the last
access by the LIO core is a call to .check_stop_free() and since the
Xen scsiback .check_stop_free() drops a reference to the TMF, it is
already guaranteed that the struct se_cmd that corresponds to the TMF
exists as long as target_tmr_work() is in progress. Hence change the
second argument of transport_generic_free_cmd() from 1 into 0.
