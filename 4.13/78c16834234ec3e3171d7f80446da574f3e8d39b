drm/amdgpu: allow split of queues with kfd at queue granularity v4

Previously the queue/pipe split with kfd operated with pipe
granularity. This patch allows amdgpu to take ownership of an arbitrary
set of queues.

It also consolidates the last few magic numbers in the compute
initialization process into mec_init.

v2: support for gfx9
v3: renamed AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES to AMDGPU_MAX_COMPUTE_QUEUES
v4: fix off-by-one in num_mec checks in *_compute_queue_acquire
