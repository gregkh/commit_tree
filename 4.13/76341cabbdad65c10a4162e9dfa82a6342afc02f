jbd2: don't clear and reset errors after waiting on writeback

Resetting this flag is almost certainly racy, and will be problematic
with some coming changes.

Make filemap_fdatawait_keep_errors return int, but not clear the flag(s).
Have jbd2 call it instead of filemap_fdatawait and don't attempt to
re-set the error flag if it fails.
