btrfs: cloned bios must not be iterated by bio_for_each_segment_all

We've started using cloned bios more in 4.13, there are some specifics
regarding the iteration.  Filipe found [1] that the raid56 iterated a
cloned bio using bio_for_each_segment_all, which is incorrect. The
cloned bios have wrong bi_vcnt and this could lead to silent
corruptions.  This patch adds assertions to all remaining
bio_for_each_segment_all cases.
