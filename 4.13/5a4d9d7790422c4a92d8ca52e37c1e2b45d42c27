scsi: cxlflash: Update debug prints in reset handlers

The device and host reset handler contain debug prints to help identify
the entities being reset. Today these reset handlers are based on a SCSI
EH design that uses a SCSI command reference as a means of identifying
the target entity. As such, the debug trace includes the SCSI command
pointer and associated CDB. This is not necessary as the SCSI command is
simply the messenger in these scenarios.

Refactor the debug prints in the host and reset handlers to only present
information that is applicable given the function scope.
