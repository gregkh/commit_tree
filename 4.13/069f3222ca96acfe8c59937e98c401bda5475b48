crush: implement weight and id overrides for straw2

bucket_straw2_choose needs to use weights that may be different from
weight_items. For instance to compensate for an uneven distribution
caused by a low number of values. Or to fix the probability biais
introduced by conditional probabilities (see
http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/15653 for more information).

We introduce a weight_set for each straw2 bucket to set the desired
weight for a given item at a given position. The weight of a given item
when picking the first replica (first position) may be different from
the weight the second replica (second position). For instance the weight
matrix for a given bucket containing items 3, 7 and 13 could be as
follows:

          position 0   position 1

item 3     0x10000      0x100000
item 7     0x40000       0x10000
item 13    0x40000       0x10000

When crush_do_rule picks the first of two replicas (position 0), item 7,
3 are four times more likely to be choosen by bucket_straw2_choose than
item 13. When choosing the second replica (position 1), item 3 is ten
times more likely to be choosen than item 7, 13.

By default the weight_set of each bucket exactly matches the content of
item_weights for each position to ensure backward compatibility.

bucket_straw2_choose compares items by using their id. The same ids are
also used to index buckets and they must be unique. For each item in a
bucket an array of ids can be provided for placement purposes and they
are used instead of the ids. If no replacement ids are provided, the
legacy behavior is preserved.

Reflects ceph.git commit 19537a450fd5c5a0bb8b7830947507a76db2ceca.
