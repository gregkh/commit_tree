[media] atomisp: putting NULs in the wrong place

We're putting the NUL terminators one space beyond where they belong.
This doesn't show up in testing because all but the callers put a NUL in
the correct place themselves.  LOL.  It causes a static checker warning
about buffer overflows.

Fixes: a49d25364dfb ("staging/atomisp: Add support for the Intel IPU v2")
