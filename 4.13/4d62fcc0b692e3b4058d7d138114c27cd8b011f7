KVM: s390: Inject machine check into the guest

If the exit flag of SIE indicates that a machine check has happened
during guest's running and needs to be injected, inject it to the guest
accordingly.
But some machine checks, e.g. Channel Report Pending (CRW), refer to
host conditions only (the guest's channel devices are not managed by
the kernel directly) and are therefore not injected into the guest.
External Damage (ED) is also not reinjected into the guest because ETR
conditions are gone in Linux and STP conditions are not enabled in the
guest, and ED contains only these 8 ETR and STP conditions.
In general, instruction-processing damage, system recovery,
storage error, service-processor damage and channel subsystem damage
will be reinjected into the guest, and the remain (System damage,
timing-facility damage, warning, ED and CRW) will be handled on the host.
