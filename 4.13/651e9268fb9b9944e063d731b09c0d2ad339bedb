ASoC: ux500: Restore platform DAI assignments

This reverts commit f1013cdeeeb9 ("ASoC: ux500: drop platform DAI
assignments"), which seems to have been based on a misunderstanding and
prevents the platform driver callbacks from being made (e.g. to
preallocate DMA memory).

The real culprit for the warnings about attempts to create duplicate
procfs entries was commit 99b04f4c4051 ("ASoC: add Component level
pcm_new/pcm_free" that broke PCM creation on systems that use more than
one platform component.
