powerpc/powernv/pci: Enable 64-bit devices to access >4GB DMA space

On PHB3/POWER8 systems, devices can select between two different sections
of address space, TVE#0 and TVE#1.  TVE#0 is intended for 32bit devices
that aren't capable of addressing more than 4GB.  Selecting TVE#1 instead,
with the capability of addressing over 4GB, is performed by setting bit 59
of a PCI address.

However, some devices aren't capable of addressing at least 59 bits, but
still want more than 4GB of DMA space.  In order to enable this, reconfigure
TVE#0 to be suitable for 64-bit devices by allocating memory past the
initial 4GB that is inaccessible by 64-bit DMAs.

This bypass mode is only enabled if a device requests 4GB or more of DMA
address space, if the system has PHB3 (POWER8 systems), and if the device
does not share a PE with any devices from different vendors.
