kexec_file: adjust declaration of kexec_purgatory

Defining kexec_purgatory as a zero-length char array upsets compile time
size checking.  Since this is built on a per-arch basis, define it as an
unsized char array (like is done for other similar things, e.g.  linker
sections).  This silences the warning generated by the future
CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, which did not like the memcmp() of a "0 byte"
array.  This drops the __weak and uses an extern instead, since both
users define kexec_purgatory.
