w1: Add subsystem kernel public interface

Like other subsystems we should be able to define slave devices outside
of the w1 directory. To do this we move public facing interface
definitions to include/linux/w1.h and rename the internal definition
file to w1_internal.h.

As w1_family.h and w1_int.h contained almost entirely public
driver interface definitions we simply removed these files and
moved the remaining definitions into w1_internal.h.

With this we can now start to move slave devices out of w1/slaves and
into the subsystem based on the function they implement, again like
other drivers.
