kvm: x86: mmu: allow A/D bits to be disabled in an mmu

Adds the plumbing to disable A/D bits in the MMU based on a new role
bit, ad_disabled. When A/D is disabled, the MMU operates as though A/D
aren't available (i.e., using access tracking faults instead).

To avoid SP -> kvm_mmu_page.role.ad_disabled lookups all over the
place, A/D disablement is now stored in the SPTE. This state is stored
in the SPTE by tweaking the use of SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK for access
tracking. Rather than just setting SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK when an
access-tracking SPTE is non-present, we now always set
SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK for access-tracking SPTEs.

[Use role.ad_disabled even for direct (non-shadow) EPT page tables.  Add
 documentation and a few MMU_WARN_ONs. - Paolo]
