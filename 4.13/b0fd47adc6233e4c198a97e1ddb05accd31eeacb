drm/i915: Copy user requested buffers into the error state

Introduce a new execobject.flag (EXEC_OBJECT_CAPTURE) that userspace may
use to indicate that it wants the contents of this buffer preserved in
the error state (/sys/class/drm/cardN/error) following a GPU hang
involving this batch.

Use this at your discretion, the contents of the error state. although
compressed, are allocated with GFP_ATOMIC (i.e. limited) and kept for all
eternity (until the error state is destroyed).
