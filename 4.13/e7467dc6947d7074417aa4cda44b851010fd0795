powerpc/fadump: Update comment about offset where fadump is reserved

With commit f6e6bedb7731 ("powerpc/fadump: Reserve memory at an offset
closer to bottom of RAM"), memory for fadump is no longer reserved at
the top of RAM. But there are still a few places which say so. Change
them appropriately.
