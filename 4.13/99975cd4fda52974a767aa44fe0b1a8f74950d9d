mlx5: Avoid that mlx5_ib_sg_to_klms() overflows the klms[] array

ib_map_mr_sg() can pass an SG-list to .map_mr_sg() that is larger
than what fits into a single MR. .map_mr_sg() must not attempt to
map more SG-list elements than what fits into a single MR.
Hence make sure that mlx5_ib_sg_to_klms() does not write outside
the MR klms[] array.
