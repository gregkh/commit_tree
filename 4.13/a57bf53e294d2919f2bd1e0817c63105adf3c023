drm/atmel-hlcdc: Use crtc->mode_valid() callback

Now that we have a callback to check if crtc supports a given mode
we can use it in atmel-hlcdc so that we restrict the number of probbed
modes to the ones we can actually display.

Also, remove the mode_fixup() callback as this is no longer needed
because mode_valid() will be called before.
