randstruct: Whitelist big_key path struct overloading

The big_key payload structure intentionally stores a struct path in
two void pointers to avoid header soup. Whitelist this case:

security/keys/big_key.c: In function ‘big_key_read’:
security/keys/big_key.c:293:16: note: found mismatched rhs struct pointer types: ‘struct path’ and ‘void *’

   struct path *path = (struct path *)&key->payload.data[big_key_path];
                ^~~~
