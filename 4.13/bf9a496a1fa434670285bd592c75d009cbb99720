drm/i915/cnl: Also need power well sanitize.

The workaround added in
commit c6782b76d31a ("drm/i915/gen9: Reset secondary power well

needs to be applied on Cannonlake as well.

So let's assume any platform using this power well setup
will also need and let's just go ahead and remove if condition.
