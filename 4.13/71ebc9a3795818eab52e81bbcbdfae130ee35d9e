dma-buf/sync-file: Defer creation of sync_file->name

Constructing the name takes the majority of the time for allocating a
sync_file to wrap a fence, and the name is very rarely used (only via
the sync_file status user interface). To reduce the impact on the common
path (that of creating sync_file to pass around), defer the construction
of the name until it is first used.

v2: Update kerneldoc (kbuild test robot)
v3: sync_debug.c was peeking at the name
v4: Comment upon the potential race between two users of
sync_file_get_name() and claim that such a race is below the level of
notice. However, to prevent any future nuisance, use a global spinlock
to serialize the assignment of the name.
v5: Completely avoid the read/write race by only storing the name passed
in from the user inside sync_file->user_name and passing in a buffer to
dynamically construct the name otherwise.
