scsi: hisi_sas: add pci_dev in hisi_hba struct

Since hip08 SAS controller is based on pci device, add hisi_hba.pci_dev
for hip08 (will be v3), and also rename hisi_hba.pdev to .platform_dev
for clarity.

In addition, for common code which wants to reference the controller
device struct, add hisi_hba.dev, and change the common code to use it.
