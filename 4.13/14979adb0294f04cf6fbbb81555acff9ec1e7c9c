drm/vmwgfx: Fix cursor hotspot issue with Wayland on Fedora

Parts of commit <8fbf9d92a7bc> (“drm/vmwgfx: Implement the
cursor_set2 callback v2”) were not moved over when we started
atomic mode set development because at that time the DRM did
not support cursor hotspots in the fb struct.

This patch fixes what was not moved over.
