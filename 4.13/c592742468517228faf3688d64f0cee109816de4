mmc: tmio: remove outdated comment

The obviously wrong comment was added in 2011 with commit df3ef2d3c92c0a
("mmc: protect the tmio_mmc driver against a theoretical race") but
already obsoleted half a year later with commit b9269fdd4f61aa ("mmc:
tmio: fix recursive spinlock, don't schedule with interrupts disabled").
