KVM: arm/arm64: Don't assume initialized vgic when setting PMU IRQ

The PMU IRQ number is set through the VCPU device's KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR
ioctl handler for the KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_IRQ attribute, but there is no
enforced or stated requirement that this must happen after initializing
the VGIC.  As a result, calling vgic_valid_spi() which relies on the
nr_spis being set during the VGIC init can incorrectly fail.

Introduce irq_is_spi, which determines if an IRQ number is within the
SPI range without verifying it against the actual VGIC properties.
