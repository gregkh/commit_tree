ptr_ring: add ptr_ring_unconsume

Applications that consume a batch of entries in one go
can benefit from ability to return some of them back
into the ring.

Add an API for that - assuming there's space. If there's no space
naturally can't do this and have to drop entries, but this implies ring
is full so we'd likely drop some anyway.
