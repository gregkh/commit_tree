virtio_blk: fix incorrect message when disk is resized

The message printed on disk resize is incorrect.  The following is
printed when resizing to 2 GiB:

  $ truncate -s 1G test.img
  $ qemu -device virtio-blk-pci,logical_block_size=4096,...
  (qemu) block_resize drive1 2G

  virtio_blk virtio0: new size: 4194304 4096-byte logical blocks (17.2 GB/16.0 GiB)

The virtio_blk capacity config field is in 512-byte sector units
regardless of logical_block_size as per the VIRTIO specification.
Therefore the message should read:

  virtio_blk virtio0: new size: 524288 4096-byte logical blocks (2.15 GB/2.0 GiB)

Note that this only affects the printed message.  Thankfully the actual
block device has the correct size because the block layer expects
capacity in sectors.
