ovl: check for bad and whiteout index on lookup

Index should always be of the same file type as origin, except for
the case of a whiteout index.  A whiteout index should only exist
if all lower aliases have been unlinked, which means that finding
a lower origin on lookup whose index is a whiteout should be treated
as a lookup error.
