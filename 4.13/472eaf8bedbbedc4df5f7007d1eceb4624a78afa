spmi: pmic-arb: check apid enabled before calling the handler

The driver currently invokes the apid handler (periph_handler())
once it sees that the summary status bit for that apid is set.

However the hardware is designed to set that bit even if the apid
interrupts are disabled. The driver should check whether the apid
is indeed enabled before calling the apid handler.
