scsi: lpfc: Fix System panic after loading the driver

System panic with general protection fault during driver load

The driver uses a static array sli4_hba.handler_name to store the irq
handler names. If the io_channel_irqs exceeds the pre-allocated size
(32+1), then the driver will overwrite other fields of sli4_hba.

Fix: Dynamically allocate handler_name.
