ARM: dts: socfpga: Remove I2C EEPROMs from VINING FPGA

Remove the EEPROMs attached to the I2C expander ports which
lead to the backplane slots from the main VIN|ING DTS file.
These EEPROMs are bound using separate DTO files, which lets
us handle both two-slot and six-slot configuration of the
backplane.
