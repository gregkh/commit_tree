sctp: fix the check for _sctp_walk_params and _sctp_walk_errors

Commit b1f5bfc27a19 ("sctp: don't dereference ptr before leaving
_sctp_walk_{params, errors}()") tried to fix the issue that it
may overstep the chunk end for _sctp_walk_{params, errors} with
'chunk_end > offset(length) + sizeof(length)'.

But it introduced a side effect: When processing INIT, it verifies
the chunks with 'param.v == chunk_end' after iterating all params
by sctp_walk_params(). With the check 'chunk_end > offset(length)
+ sizeof(length)', it would return when the last param is not yet
accessed. Because the last param usually is fwdtsn supported param
whose size is 4 and 'chunk_end == offset(length) + sizeof(length)'

This is a badly issue even causing sctp couldn't process 4-shakes.
Client would always get abort when connecting to server, due to
the failure of INIT chunk verification on server.

The patch is to use 'chunk_end <= offset(length) + sizeof(length)'
instead of 'chunk_end < offset(length) + sizeof(length)' for both
_sctp_walk_params and _sctp_walk_errors.
