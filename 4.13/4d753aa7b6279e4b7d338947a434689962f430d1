thermal: cpu_cooling: use cpufreq_policy to register cooling device

The CPU cooling driver uses the cpufreq policy, to get clip_cpus, the
frequency table, etc. Most of the callers of CPU cooling driver's
registration routines have the cpufreq policy with them, but they only
pass the policy->related_cpus cpumask. The __cpufreq_cooling_register()
routine then gets the policy by itself and uses it.

It would be much better if the callers can pass the policy instead
directly. This also fixes a basic design flaw, where the policy can be
freed while the CPU cooling driver is still active.
