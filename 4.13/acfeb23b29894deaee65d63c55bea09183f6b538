scsi: cxlflash: Avoid double free of character device

The device_unregister() service used when cleaning up the character
device is already responsible for the internal state associated with the
device upon successful creation. As the cxlflash driver does not obtain
a second reference to the character device, the explicit call to
put_device() is not required and can lead to an inconsistent sysfs among
other issues as the reference is no longer valid after the first
put_device() is performed.

Remove the unnecessary put_device() to remedy this issue.
