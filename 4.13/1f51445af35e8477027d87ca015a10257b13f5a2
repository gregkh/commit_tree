bridge: Export VLAN filtering state

It's useful for drivers supporting bridge offload to be able to query
the bridge's VLAN filtering state.

Currently, upon enslavement to a bridge master, the offloading driver
will only learn about the bridge's VLAN filtering state after the bridge
device was already linked with its slave.

Being able to query the bridge's VLAN filtering state allows such
drivers to forbid enslavement in case resource couldn't be allocated for
a VLAN-aware bridge and also choose the correct initialization routine
for the enslaved port, which is dependent on the bridge type.
