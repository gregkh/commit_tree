firmware: share fw fallback killing on reboot/suspend

We kill pending fallback requests on suspend and reboot,
the only difference is that on suspend we only kill custom
fallback requests. Provide a wrapper that lets us customize
the request with a flag.

This also lets us simplify the #ifdef'ery over the calls.
