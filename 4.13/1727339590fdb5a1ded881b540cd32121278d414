clocksource/drivers: Rename CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE to TIMER_OF_DECLARE

The CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE macro is used widely for the timers to declare the
clocksource at early stage. However, this macro is also used to initialize
the clockevent if any, or the clockevent only.

It was originally suggested to declare another macro to initialize a
clockevent, so in order to separate the two entities even they belong to the
same IP. This was not accepted because of the impact on the DT where splitting
a clocksource/clockevent definition does not make sense as it is a Linux
concept not a hardware description.

On the other side, the clocksource has not interrupt declared while the
clockevent has, so it is easy from the driver to know if the description is
for a clockevent or a clocksource, IOW it could be implemented at the driver
level.

So instead of dealing with a named clocksource macro, let's use a more generic
one: TIMER_OF_DECLARE.

The patch has not functional changes.
