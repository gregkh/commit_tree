tty: pl011: fix initialization order of QDF2400 E44

The work-around for Qualcomm Technologies QDF2400 Erratum 44 hinges on a
global variable defined in the pl011 driver.  The ACPI SPCR parsing code
determines whether the work-around is needed, and if so, it changes the
console name from "pl011" to "qdf2400_e44".  The expectation is that
the pl011 driver will implement the work-around when it sees the console
name.  The global variable qdf2400_e44_present is set when that happens.

The problem is that work-around needs to be enabled when the pl011
driver probes, not when the console name is queried.  However, sbsa_probe()
is called before pl011_console_match().  The work-around appeared to work
previously because the default console on QDF2400 platforms was always
ttyAMA1.  The first time sbsa_probe() is called (for ttyAMA0),
qdf2400_e44_present is still false.  Then pl011_console_match() is called,
and it sets qdf2400_e44_present to true.  All subsequent calls to
sbsa_probe() enable the work-around.

The solution is to move the global variable into spcr.c and let the
pl011 driver query it during probe time.  This works because all QDF2400
platforms require SPCR, so parse_spcr() will always be called.
pl011_console_match still checks for the "qdf2400_e44" console name,
but it doesn't do anything else special.
