cgroup: implement "nsdelegate" mount option

Currently, cgroup only supports delegation to !root users and cgroup
namespaces don't get any special treatments.  This limits the
usefulness of cgroup namespaces as they by themselves can't be safe
delegation boundaries.  A process inside a cgroup can change the
resource control knobs of the parent in the namespace root and may
move processes in and out of the namespace if cgroups outside its
namespace are visible somehow.

This patch adds a new mount option "nsdelegate" which makes cgroup
namespaces delegation boundaries.  If set, cgroup behaves as if write
permission based delegation took place at namespace boundaries -
writes to the resource control knobs from the namespace root are
denied and migration crossing the namespace boundary aren't allowed
from inside the namespace.

This allows cgroup namespace to function as a delegation boundary by
itself.

v2: Silently ignore nsdelegate specified on !init mounts.
