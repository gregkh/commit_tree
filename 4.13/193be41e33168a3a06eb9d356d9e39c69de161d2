sched/deadline: Fix confusing comments about selection of top pi-waiter

This comment in the code is incomplete, and I believe it begs a definition of
dl_boosted to make sense of the condition that follows. Rewrite the comment and
also rearrange the condition that follows to reflect the first condition "we
have a top pi-waiter which is a SCHED_DEADLINE task" in that order. Also fix a
typo that follows.
