qede: Allow WoL to activate by default

When management firmware declares that the device is WoL-capable,
the default driver behavior would be to allow the management firmware
to take the decision of whether it's actually needed or not.

Problem is ethtool interface doesn't have a 'default' kind
of option, and user would see the interface WoL as disabled,
which doesn't accurately reflect the actual configuration.
More-so, if the user actually wants to explicitly disable WoL he'd have
to first enable it [otherwise ethtool would block the command].

Instead of allowing management to make the decision, enable WoL by
default on all devices capable of it.
