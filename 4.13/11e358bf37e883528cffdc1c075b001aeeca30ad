media: ddbridge: use dev_* macros in favor of printk

Side effect: KERN_DEBUG messages aren't written to the kernel log anymore.
This also improves the tda18212_ping reporting a bit so users know that if
pinging wasn't successful, bad things will happen.

Since in module_init_ddbridge() there's no dev yet, pr_info is used
instead.
