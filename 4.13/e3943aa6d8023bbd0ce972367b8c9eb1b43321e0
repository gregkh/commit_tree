[media] dvb-frontends/cxd2841er: make lock wait in set_fe_tc() optional

Don't wait for FE_HAS_LOCK in set_frontend_tc() and thus don't hammer the
lock status register with inquiries when CXD2841ER_NO_WAIT_LOCK is set
in the configuration, which also unneccessarily blocks applications until
a TS LOCK has been acquired. Rather, API and applications will check for
a TS LOCK by utilising the tune fe_op, read_status and get_frontend ops,
which is sufficient.
