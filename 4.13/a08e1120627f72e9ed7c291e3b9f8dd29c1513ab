IB/ipoib: Make sure no in-flight joins while leaving that mcast

While cleaning neighs and there is a send-only mcast neigh, the driver
should wait to finish its join process before trying to remove it.

Without this patch, we will see messages like: "ipoib_mcast_leave on an
in-flight join" and unexpected results in the join_complete.
