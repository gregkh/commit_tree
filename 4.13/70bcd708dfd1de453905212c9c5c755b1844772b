KVM: vmx: expose more information for KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_DELIVERY_EV exits

This exit ended up being reported, but the currently exposed data does not provide
much of a starting point for debugging.  In the reported case, the vmexit was
an EPT misconfiguration (MMIO access).  Let userspace report ethe exit qualification
and, if relevant, the GPA.
