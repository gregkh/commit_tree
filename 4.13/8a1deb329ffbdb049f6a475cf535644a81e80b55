drm/i915/glk: Add cold boot sequence for GLK DSI

As per BSEPC, if device ready bit is '0' in enable IO sequence
then its a cold boot/reset scenario eg: S3/S4 resume. If cold boot
scenario detected in enable IO, then prepare port immediately.
In normal boot scenario, prepare port after glk_dsi_device_ready().
Without cold boot sequence enabled, features like S3/S4 doesn't work.
