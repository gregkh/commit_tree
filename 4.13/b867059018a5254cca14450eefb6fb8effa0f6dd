x86/MCE, xen/mcelog: Make /dev/mcelog registration messages more precise

When running under Xen as dom0, /dev/mcelog is being provided by Xen
instead of the normal mcelog character device of the MCE core. Convert
an error message being issued by the MCE core in this case to an
informative message that Xen has registered the device.
