dmaengine: Add Broadcom SBA RAID driver

The Broadcom stream buffer accelerator (SBA) provides offloading
capabilities for RAID operations. This SBA offload engine is
accessible via Broadcom SoC specific ring manager.

This patch adds Broadcom SBA RAID driver which provides one
DMA device with RAID capabilities using one or more Broadcom
SoC specific ring manager channels. The SBA RAID driver in its
current shape implements memcpy, xor, and pq operations.
