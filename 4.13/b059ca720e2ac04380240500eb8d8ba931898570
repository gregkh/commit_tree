ASoC: rt5665: calibration should be done before jack detection

We will set some volatile registers in jack detection function. But
those volatile registers will be clear in rt5665_calibrate function
because we set cache bypass and reset codec in rt5665_calibrate function.
This patch add a flag to make sure that rt5665_calibrate is done
before starting jack detection.
