mm: set both AS_EIO/AS_ENOSPC and errseq_t in mapping_set_error

When a writeback error occurs, we want later callers to be able to pick
up that fact when they go to wait on that writeback to complete.
Traditionally, we've used AS_EIO/AS_ENOSPC flags to track that, but
that's problematic since only one "checker" will be informed when an
error occurs.

In later patches, we're going to want to convert many of these callers
to check for errors since a well-defined point in time. For now, ensure
that we can handle both sorts of checks by both setting errors in both
places when there is a writeback failure.
