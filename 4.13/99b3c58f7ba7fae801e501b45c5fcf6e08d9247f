PCI: Test INTx masking during enumeration, not at run-time

The test for INTx masking via PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE performed in
pci_intx_mask_supported() should be done before the device can be used.
This is to avoid writing PCI_COMMAND while the driver owns the device, in
case that has any effect on MSI/MSI-X interrupts.

Move the content of pci_intx_mask_supported() to pci_intx_mask_broken() and
call it from pci_setup_device().

The test result can be queried at any time later using the same
pci_intx_mask_supported() interface as before (though with changed
implementation), so callers (uio, vfio) should be unaffected.
