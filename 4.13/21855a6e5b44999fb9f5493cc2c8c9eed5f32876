MIPS: build: Fix "-modd-spreg" switch usage when compiling for mips32r6

Add "-modd-spreg" when compiling the kernel for mips32r6 target.

This makes sure the kernel builds properly even with toolchains that
use "-mno-odd-spreg" by default. This is the case with Android gcc.
Prior to this patch, kernel builds using gcc for Android failed with
following error messages, if target architecture is set to mips32r6:
