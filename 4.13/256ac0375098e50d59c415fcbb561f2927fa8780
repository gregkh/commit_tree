dt-bindings: document devicetree bindings for mux-controllers and gpio-mux

Allow specifying that a single multiplexer controller can be used to
control several parallel multiplexers, thus enabling sharing of the
multiplexer controller by different consumers.

Add a binding for a first mux controller in the form of a GPIO based mux
controller.
