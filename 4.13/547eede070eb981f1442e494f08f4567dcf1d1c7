net/mlx5e: IPSec, Innova IPSec offload infrastructure

Add Innova IPSec ESP crypto offload configuration paths.
Detect Innova IPSec device and set the NETIF_F_HW_ESP flag.
Configure Security Associations using the API introduced in a previous
patch.

Add Software-parser hardware descriptor layout
Software-Parser (swp) is a hardware feature in ConnectX which allows the
host software to specify protocol header offsets in the TX path, thus
overriding the hardware parser.
This is useful for protocols that the ASIC may not be able to parse on
its own.

Note that due to inline metadata, XDP is not supported in Innova IPSec.
