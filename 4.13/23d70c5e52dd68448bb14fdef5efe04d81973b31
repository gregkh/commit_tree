dm ioctl: report event number in DM_LIST_DEVICES

Report the event numbers for all the devices, so that the user doesn't
have to ask them one by one.  The event number is reported after the
name field in the dm_name_list structure.

The location of the next record is specified in the dm_name_list->next
field, that means that we can put the new data after the end of name and
it is backward compatible with the old code.  The old code just skips
the event number without interpreting it.
