scsi: sg: fix static checker warning in sg_is_valid_dxfer

dxfer_len is an unsigned int and we always assign a value > 0 to it, so
it doesn't make any sense to check if it is < 0. We can't really check
dxferp as well as we have both NULL and not NULL cases in the possible
call paths.

So just return true for SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV transfer in
sg_is_valid_dxfer().
