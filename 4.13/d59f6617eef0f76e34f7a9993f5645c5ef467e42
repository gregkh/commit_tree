genirq: Allow fwnode to carry name information only

In order to provide proper debug interface it's required to have domain
names available when the domain is added. Non fwnode based architectures
like x86 have no way to do so.

It's not possible to use domain ops or host data for this as domain ops
might be the same for several instances, but the names have to be unique.

Extend the irqchip fwnode to allow transporting the domain name. If no node
is supplied, create a 'unknown-N' placeholder.

Warn if an invalid node is supplied and treat it like no node. This happens
e.g. with i2 devices on x86 which hand in an ACPI type node which has no
interface for retrieving the name.
