net: ipmr: add getlink support

Currently there's no way to dump the VIF table for an ipmr table other
than the default (via proc). This is a major issue when debugging ipmr
issues and in general it is good to know which interfaces are
configured. This patch adds support for RTM_GETLINK for the ipmr family
so we can dump the VIF table and the ipmr table's current config for
each table. We're protected by rtnl so no need to acquire RCU or
mrt_lock.
