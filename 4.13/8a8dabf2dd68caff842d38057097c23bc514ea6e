tty: handle the case where we cannot restore a line discipline

Historically the N_TTY driver could never fail but this has become broken over
time. Rather than trying to rewrite half the ldisc layer to fix the breakage
introduce a second level of fallback with an N_NULL ldisc which cannot fail,
and thus restore the guarantees required by the ldisc layer.

We still try and fail to N_TTY first. It's much more useful to find yourself
back in your old ldisc (first attempt) or in N_TTY (second attempt), and while
I'm not aware of any code out there that makes those assumptions it's good to
drive(r) defensively.
