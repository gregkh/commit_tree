regulator: palmas: Drop unnecessary static

Drop static on a local variable, when the variable is initialized before
any use, on every possible execution path through the function.

The semantic patch that fixes this problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@bad exists@
position p;
identifier x;
type T;
@@

static T x@p;
...
x = <+...x...+>

@@
identifier x;
expression e;
type T;
position p != bad.p;
@@

-static
 T x@p;
 ... when != x
     when strict
?x = e;
// </smpl>

There is no reduction in code size in this case, but the change does reduce
the size of the bss segment, containing uninitialized static data.
