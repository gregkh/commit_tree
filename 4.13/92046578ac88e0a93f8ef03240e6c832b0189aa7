bpf: cgroup skb progs cannot access ld_abs/ind

Commit fb9a307d11d6 ("bpf: Allow CGROUP_SKB eBPF program to
access sk_buff") enabled programs of BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB
type to use ld_abs/ind instructions. However, at this point,
we cannot use them, since offsets relative to SKF_LL_OFF will
end up pointing skb_mac_header(skb) out of bounds since in the
egress path it is not yet set at that point in time, but only
after __dev_queue_xmit() did a general reset on the mac header.
bpf_internal_load_pointer_neg_helper() will then end up reading
data from a wrong offset.

BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB programs can use bpf_skb_load_bytes()
already to access packet data, which is also more flexible than
the insns carried over from cBPF.
