mm, memory_hotplug: simplify empty node mask handling in new_node_page

new_node_page tries to allocate the target page on a different NUMA node
than the source page.  This makes sense in most cases during the hotplug
because we are likely to offline the whole numa node.  But there are
cases where there are no other nodes to fallback (e.g.  when offlining
parts of the only existing node) and we have to fallback to allocating
from the source node.  The current code does that but it can be
simplified by checking the nmask and updating it before we even try to
allocate rather than special casing it.

This patch shouldn't introduce any functional change.
