drm/tegra: Check for malformed offsets and sizes in the 'submit' IOCTL

If commands buffer claims a number of words that is higher than its BO can
fit, a kernel OOPS will be fired on the out-of-bounds BO access. This was
triggered by an opentegra Xorg driver that erroneously pushed too many
commands to the pushbuf.

The CDMA commands buffer address is 4 bytes aligned, so check its
alignment.

The maximum number of the CDMA gather fetches is 16383, add a check for
it.

Add a sanity check for the relocations in a same way.
