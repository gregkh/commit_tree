block, bfq: update wr_busy_queues if needed on a queue split

This commit fixes a bug triggered by a non-trivial sequence of
events. These events are briefly described in the next two
paragraphs. The impatiens, or those who are familiar with queue
merging and splitting, can jump directly to the last paragraph.

On each I/O-request arrival for a shared bfq_queue, i.e., for a
bfq_queue that is the result of the merge of two or more bfq_queues,
BFQ checks whether the shared bfq_queue has become seeky (i.e., if too
many random I/O requests have arrived for the bfq_queue; if the device
is non rotational, then random requests must be also small for the
bfq_queue to be tagged as seeky). If the shared bfq_queue is actually
detected as seeky, then a split occurs: the bfq I/O context of the
process that has issued the request is redirected from the shared
bfq_queue to a new non-shared bfq_queue. As a degenerate case, if the
shared bfq_queue actually happens to be shared only by one process
(because of previous splits), then no new bfq_queue is created: the
state of the shared bfq_queue is just changed from shared to non
shared.

Regardless of whether a brand new non-shared bfq_queue is created, or
the pre-existing shared bfq_queue is just turned into a non-shared
bfq_queue, several parameters of the non-shared bfq_queue are set
(restored) to the original values they had when the bfq_queue
associated with the bfq I/O context of the process (that has just
issued an I/O request) was merged with the shared bfq_queue. One of
these parameters is the weight-raising state.

If, on the split of a shared bfq_queue,
1) a pre-existing shared bfq_queue is turned into a non-shared
bfq_queue;
2) the previously shared bfq_queue happens to be busy;
3) the weight-raising state of the previously shared bfq_queue happens
to change;
the number of weight-raised busy queues changes. The field
wr_busy_queues must then be updated accordingly, but such an update
was missing. This commit adds the missing update.
