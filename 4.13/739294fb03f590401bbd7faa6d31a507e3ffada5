sched/numa: Override part of migrate_degrades_locality() when idle balancing

Several tests in the NAS benchmark seem to run a lot slower with
NUMA balancing enabled, than with NUMA balancing disabled. The
slower run time corresponds with increased idle time.

Overriding the final test of migrate_degrades_locality (but still
doing the other NUMA tests first) seems to improve performance
of those benchmarks.
