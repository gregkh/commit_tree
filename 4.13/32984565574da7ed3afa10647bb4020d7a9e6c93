tcp_bbr: init pacing rate on first RTT sample

Fixes the following behavior: for connections that had no RTT sample
at the time of initializing congestion control, BBR was initializing
the pacing rate to a high nominal rate (based an a guess of RTT=1ms,
in case this is LAN traffic). Then BBR never adjusted the pacing rate
downward upon obtaining an actual RTT sample, if the connection never
filled the pipe (e.g. all sends were small app-limited writes()).

This fix adjusts the pacing rate upon obtaining the first RTT sample.
