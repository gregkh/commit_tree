[media] v4l: fwnode: Support generic fwnode for parsing standardised properties

The fwnode_handle is a more generic way than OF device_node to describe
firmware nodes. Instead of the OF API, use more generic fwnode API to
obtain the same information.

As the V4L2 fwnode support will be required by a small minority of e.g.
ACPI based systems (the same might actually go for OF), make this a module
instead of embedding it in the videodev module.

The origins of the V4L2 fwnode framework is in the V4L2 OF framework.
