rcu: Improve __call_rcu() debug-objects error message

The "__call_rcu(): Leaked duplicate callback" error message from
__call_rcu() has proven to be unhelpful.  This commit therefore changes
it to "__call_rcu(): Double-freed CB" and adds the value of the pointer
passed in.  The value of the pointer improves debuggability by allowing
correlation with tracing output, for example, the rcu:rcu_callback trace
event.
