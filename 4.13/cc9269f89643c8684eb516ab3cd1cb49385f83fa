gpio: gpio-mxc: Fix: higher 16 GPIOs usable as wake source

In the function gpio_set_wake_irq(), port->irq_high is only checked for
zero. As platform_get_irq() returns a value less then zero if no interrupt
was found, any gpio >= 16 was handled like an irq_high interrupt was
available. On iMX27 for example no high interrupt is available. This lead
to the problem that only some gpios (the lower 16) were useable as wake
sources.
