crypto: testmgr - add genkey kpp test

The test considers a party that already has a private-public
key pair and a party that provides a NULL key. The kernel will
generate the private-public key pair for the latter, computes
the shared secret on both ends and verifies if it's the same.

The explicit private-public key pair was copied from
the previous test vector.
