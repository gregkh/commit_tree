x86/ldt: Rename ldt_struct::size to ::nr_entries

... because this is exactly what it is: the number of entries in the
LDT. Calling it "size" is simply confusing and it is actually begging
to be called "nr_entries" or somesuch, especially if you see constructs
like:

	alloc_size = size * LDT_ENTRY_SIZE;

since LDT_ENTRY_SIZE is the size of a single entry.

There should be no functionality change resulting from this patch, as
the before/after output from tools/testing/selftests/x86/ldt_gdt.c
shows.
