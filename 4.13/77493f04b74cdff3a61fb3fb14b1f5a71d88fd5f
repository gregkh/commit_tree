procfs: fdinfo: extend information about epoll target files

Since it is possbile to have same number in tfd field (say file added,
closed, then nother file dup'ed to same number and added back) it is
imposible to distinguish such target files solely by their numbers.

Strictly speaking regular applications don't need to recognize these
targets at all but for checkpoint/restore sake we need to collect
targets to be able to push them back on restore stage in a proper order.

Thus lets add file position, inode and device number where this target
lays.  This three fields can be used as a primary key for sorting, and
together with kcmp help CRIU can find out an exact file target (from the
whole set of processes being checkpointed).
