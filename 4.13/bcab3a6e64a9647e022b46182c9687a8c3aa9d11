ALSA: pcm: Fix power lock unbalance via OSS emulation

PCM OSS emulation issues the drain ioctl without power lock.  It used
to work in the earlier kernels as the power lock was taken inside
snd_pcm_drain() itself.  But since 68b4acd32249 ("ALSA: pcm: Apply
power lock globally to common ioctls"), the power lock is taken
outside the function.  Due to that change, the call via OSS emulation
leads to the unbalanced power lock, thus it deadlocks.

As a quick fix, just take the power lock before snd_pcm_drain() call
for OSS emulation path.  A better cleanup will follow later.
