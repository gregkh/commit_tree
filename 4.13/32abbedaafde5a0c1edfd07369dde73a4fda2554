scsi: cxlflash: Update send_tmf() parameters

The current send_tmf() implementation is based on the caller providing a
SCSI command reference. In reality all that is needed is a SCSI device
reference as the routine uses a private command.

Refactor send_tmf() to pass the private adapter configuration reference
and a SCSI device reference. As a nice side effect, this will ease the
burden of converting caller routines to be based solely off of a SCSI
device reference.
