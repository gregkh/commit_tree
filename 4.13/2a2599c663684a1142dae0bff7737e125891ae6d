[media] media: entity: Catch unbalanced media_pipeline_stop calls

Drivers must not perform unbalanced calls to stop the entity pipeline,
however if they do they will fault in the core media code, as the
entity->pipe will be set as NULL. We handle this gracefully in the core
with a WARN for the developer.

Replace the erroneous check on zero streaming counts, with a check on
NULL pipe elements instead, as this is the symptom of unbalanced
media_pipeline_stop calls.
