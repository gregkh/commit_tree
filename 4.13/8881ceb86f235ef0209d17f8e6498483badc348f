[media] dvb-frontends/stv0367: move out tables, support multiple tab variants

Move the *ter and *cab st_register tables into a separate header file and
additionally organize them via a multidimensional array, allowing to add
more tables with differing init values, and also prepare for a base init
table which should contain general setup values. Also add a state var to
store the table triplet to be used.

Also fixes three minor style problems reported by checkpatch.
