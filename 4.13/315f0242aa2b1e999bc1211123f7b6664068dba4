drm/vgem: Convert to a struct drm_device subclass

With Laura's introduction of the fake platform device for importing
dmabuf, we add a second static that is logically tied to the vgem_device.
Convert vgem over to using the struct drm_device subclassing, so that
the platform device is stored inside its owner.
