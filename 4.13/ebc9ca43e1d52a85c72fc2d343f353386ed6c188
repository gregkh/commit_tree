IB/core: Allow QP state transition from reset to error

Playing with IP-O-IB interface can trigger a warning message:
"ib0: Failed to modify QP to ERROR state" to be logged.
This happens when the QP is in IB_QPS_RESET state and the stack
is trying to transition it to IB_QPS_ERR state in ipoib_ib_dev_stop().

According to the IB spec, Table 91 - "QP State Transition Properties"
it looks like the transition from reset to error is valid:

Transition: Any State to Error
Required Attributes: None
Optional Attributes: None allowed
Actions: Queue processing is stopped. Work Requests pending or in
process are completed in error, when possible.

This patch allows the transition and quiets the message.
