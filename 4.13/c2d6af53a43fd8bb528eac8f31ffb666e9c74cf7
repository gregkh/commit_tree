ALSA: hda/realtek - Add default procedure for suspend and resume state

Except ALC269.
This will reduce pop noise from headset or headphone.
If codec enter to power save state, when plug headset or headphone....
It has a chance to cut off power by system.
Our new codec use this procedure will be more stable during suspend
and resume state.
