mm: memcontrol: per-lruvec stats infrastructure

lruvecs are at the intersection of the NUMA node and memcg, which is the
scope for most paging activity.

Introduce a convenient accounting infrastructure that maintains
statistics per node, per memcg, and the lruvec itself.

Then convert over accounting sites for statistics that are already
tracked in both nodes and memcgs and can be easily switched.
