mtd: nand: jz4740: Let the pinctrl driver configure the pins

Before, this NAND driver would set itself the configuration of the
chip-select pins for the various NAND banks.

Now that the JZ4740 and similar SoCs have a pinctrl driver, we rely on
the pins being properly configured before the driver probes.
