powerpc/64s: Avoid r3 save/restore in SLB miss handler

The SLB miss handler uses r3 for the faulting address but r12 is
mostly able to be freed up to save r3 in. It just requires SRR1
be reloaded again on error.

It would be more conventional to use r12 for SRR1 (and use r11 to
save r3), but slb_allocate_realmode clobbers r11 and not r12.
