clocksource/drivers/timer-of: Handle of_irq_get_byname() result correctly

of_irq_get_byname() may return a negative error number as well as 0 on
failure, while timer_irq_init() only checks for 0, blithely continuing with
the call to request_[percpu_]irq() -- those functions expect *unsigned int*,
so would probably fail anyway when a large IRQ number resulting from a
conversion of a negative error number is passed to them... This, however,
is incorrect behavior -- error number is not IRQ number.

Filter out the negative error numbers, complain, and return them to the
timer_irq_init()'s callers...
