media: em28xx: Ignore errors while reading from eeprom

While testing support for Terratec H6 rev. 2, it was noticed
that reading from eeprom there causes a timeout error.

Apparently, this is due to the need of properly setting GPIOs.

In any case, the driver doesn't really require eeprom reading
to succeed, as this is currently used only for debug.

So, Ignore such errors.
