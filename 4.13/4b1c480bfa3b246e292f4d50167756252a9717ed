sched/wait: Re-adjust macro line continuation backslashes in <linux/wait.h>

So there's over 300 CPP macro line-continuation backslashes in
include/linux/wait.h (!!), which are aligned vertically to make
the macro maze a bit more navigable.

The recent renames and reorganization broke some of them, and
instead of re-aligning them in every patch (which would add
a lot of stylistic noise to the patches and make them less
readable), I just ignored them - and fixed them up in a single
go in this patch.
