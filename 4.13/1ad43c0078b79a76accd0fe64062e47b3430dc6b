blk-mq: don't leak preempt counter/q_usage_counter when allocating rq failed

When blk_mq_get_request() failed, preempt counter isn't
released, and blk_mq_make_request() doesn't release the counter
too.

This patch fixes the issue, and makes sure that preempt counter
is only held if rq is allocated successfully. The same policy is
applied on .q_usage_counter too.
