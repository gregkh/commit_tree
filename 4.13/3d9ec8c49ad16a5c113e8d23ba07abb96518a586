btrfs: rename btrfs_leaf_data to BTRFS_LEAF_DATA_OFFSET

Commit 5f39d397dfbe ("Btrfs: Create extent_buffer interface
for large blocksizes") refactored btrfs_leaf_data function to take
extent_buffer rather than struct btrfs_leaf. However, as it turns out the
parameter being passed is never used. Furthermore this function no longer
returns the leaf data but rather the offset to it. So rename the function
to BTRFS_LEAF_DATA_OFFSET to make it consistent with other BTRFS_LEAF_*
helpers and turn it into a macro.
