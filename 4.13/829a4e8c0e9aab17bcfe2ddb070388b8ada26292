PM / OPP: Add dev_pm_opp_{set|put}_clkname()

In order to support OPP switching, OPP layer needs to get pointer to the
clock for the device. Simple cases work fine without using the routines
added by this patch (i.e.  by passing connection-id as NULL), but for a
device with multiple clocks available, the OPP core needs to know the
exact name of the clk to use.

Add a new set of APIs to get that done.
