ARM64/PCI: Set root bus NUMA node on ACPI systems

PCI core requires the NUMA node for the struct pci_host_bridge.dev to
be set by using the pcibus_to_node(struct pci_bus*) API, that on ARM64
systems relies on the struct pci_host_bridge->bus.dev NUMA node.

The struct pci_host_bridge.dev NUMA node is then propagated through
the PCI device hierarchy as PCI devices (and bridges) are enumerated
under it.

Therefore, in order to set-up the PCI NUMA hierarchy appropriately, the
struct pci_host_bridge->bus.dev NUMA node must be set before core
code calls pcibus_to_node(struct pci_bus*) on it so that PCI core can
retrieve the NUMA node for the struct pci_host_bridge.dev device and can
propagate it through the PCI bus tree.

On ARM64 ACPI based systems the struct pci_host_bridge->bus.dev NUMA
node can be set-up in pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() by parsing the root
bridge ACPI device firmware binding.

Add code to the pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() that, when booting with
ACPI, parse the root bridge ACPI device companion NUMA binding and set
the corresponding struct pci_host_bridge->bus.dev NUMA node
appropriately.
