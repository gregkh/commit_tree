i40e: avoid permanent lock of *_PTP_TX_IN_PROGRESS

The i40e driver uses a bit lock to indicate when a Tx timestamp is in
progress to avoid attempting to timestamp multiple packets at once. This
is required because hardware only has registers to handle one request at
a time.

There is a corner case where we failed to cleanup the bit lock after
a failed transmit. This can potentially result in a state bit being
locked forever.

Add some cleanup code to i40e_xmit_frame_ring to check and make sure we
cleanup incase of these failures. We also modify i40e_tx_map to return
an error code indication DMA failure.
