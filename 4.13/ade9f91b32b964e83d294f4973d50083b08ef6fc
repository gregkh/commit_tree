ipc: add missing container_of()s for randstruct

When building with the randstruct gcc plugin, the layout of the IPC
structs will be randomized, which requires any sub-structure accesses to
use container_of().  The proc display handlers were missing the needed
container_of()s since the iterator is passing in the top-level struct
kern_ipc_perm.

This would lead to crashes when running the "lsipc" program after the
system had IPC registered (e.g. after starting up Gnome):

  general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
