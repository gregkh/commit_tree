drm/vmwgfx: Fix F26 Wayland screen update issue

vmwgfx currently cannot support non-blocking commit because when
vmw_*_crtc_page_flip is called, drm_atomic_nonblocking_commit()
schedules the update on a thread.  This means vmw_*_crtc_page_flip
cannot rely on the new surface being bound before the subsequent
dirty and flush operations happen.
