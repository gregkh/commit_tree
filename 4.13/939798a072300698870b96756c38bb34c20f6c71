sched/wait: Improve the bit-wait API parameter names in the API function prototypes

Contrary to kernel tradition, most of the bit-wait function prototypes
in <linux/wait.h> don't fully define the parameter names, they only
list the types:

	int out_of_line_wait_on_bit_timeout(void *, int, wait_bit_action_f *, unsigned, unsigned long);

... which is pretty passive-aggressive in terms of informing the reader
about what these functions are doing.

Fill in the parameter names, such as:

	int out_of_line_wait_on_bit_timeout(void *word, int, wait_bit_action_f *action, unsigned int mode, unsigned long timeout);

Also turn spurious (and inconsistently utilized) cases of 'unsigned' into 'unsigned int'.
