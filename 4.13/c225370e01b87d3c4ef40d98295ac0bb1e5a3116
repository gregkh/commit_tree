Input: xpad - sync supported devices with 360Controller

360Controller [0] is an OpenSource driver for Xbox/Xbox360/XboxOne
controllers on macOS.

It contains a couple device IDs unknown to the Linux driver, so I wrote a
small Python script [1] to extract them and feed them into my previous
script [2] to compare them with the IDs known to Linux.

For most devices, this information is not really needed as xpad is able to
automatically detect the type of an unknown Xbox Controller at run-time.
I've therefore stripped all the generic/vague entries.

I've excluded the Logitech G920, it's handled by a HID driver already.
I've also excluded the Scene It! Big Button IR, it's handled by an
out-of-tree driver. [3]
