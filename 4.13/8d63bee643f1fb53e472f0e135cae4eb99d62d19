net: avoid skb_warn_bad_offload false positives on UFO

skb_warn_bad_offload triggers a warning when an skb enters the GSO
stack at __skb_gso_segment that does not have CHECKSUM_PARTIAL
checksum offload set.

Commit b2504a5dbef3 ("net: reduce skb_warn_bad_offload() noise")
observed that SKB_GSO_DODGY producers can trigger the check and
that passing those packets through the GSO handlers will fix it
up. But, the software UFO handler will set ip_summed to
CHECKSUM_NONE.

When __skb_gso_segment is called from the receive path, this
triggers the warning again.

Make UFO set CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY instead of CHECKSUM_NONE. On
Tx these two are equivalent. On Rx, this better matches the
skb state (checksum computed), as CHECKSUM_NONE here means no
checksum computed.
