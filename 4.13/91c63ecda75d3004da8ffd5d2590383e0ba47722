xfs: map KM_MAYFAIL to __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL

KM_MAYFAIL didn't have any suitable GFP_FOO counterpart until recently
so it relied on the default page allocator behavior for the given set of
flags.  This means that small allocations actually never failed.

Now that we have __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL flag which works independently on
the allocation request size we can map KM_MAYFAIL to it.  The allocator
will try as hard as it can to fulfill the request but fails eventually
if the progress cannot be made.  It does so without triggering the OOM
killer which can be seen as an improvement because KM_MAYFAIL users
should be able to deal with allocation failures.
