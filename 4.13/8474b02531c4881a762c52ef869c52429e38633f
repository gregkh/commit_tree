gpu: host1x: Refactor channel allocation code

This is largely a rewrite of the Host1x channel allocation code, bringing
several changes:

- The previous code could deadlock due to an interaction
  between the 'reflock' mutex and CDMA timeout handling.
  This gets rid of the mutex.
- Support for more than 32 channels, required for Tegra186
- General refactoring, including better encapsulation
  of channel ownership handling into channel.c
