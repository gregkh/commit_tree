perf: qcom_l2: fix column exclusion check

The check for column exclusion did not verify that the event being
checked was an L2 event, and not a software event.
Software events should not be checked for column exclusion.
This resulted in a group with both software and L2 events sometimes
incorrectly rejecting the L2 event for column exclusion and
not counting it.

Add a check for PMU type before applying column exclusion logic.
