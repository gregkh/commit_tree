iio: trigger: stm32-timer: fix get/set down count direction

Fixes: 4adec7da0536 ("iio: stm32 trigger: Add quadrature encoder device")

This fixes two issues:
- stm32_set_count_direction: to set down direction
- stm32_get_count_direction: to get down direction

IIO core provides/expects value to be an index of iio_enum items array.
This needs to be turned by these routines into TIM_CR1_DIR (e.g. BIT(4))
value.
Also, report error when attempting to write direction, when in encoder
mode: in this case, direction is read only (given by encoder inputs).
