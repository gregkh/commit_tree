ext4: fix ref counting for ea_inode

The ref count on ea_inode is incremented by
ext4_xattr_inode_orphan_add() which is supposed to be decremented by
ext4_xattr_inode_array_free(). The decrement is conditioned on whether
the ea_inode is currently on the orphan list. However, the orphan list
addition only happens when journaling is enabled. In non-journaled case,r
we fail to release the ref count causing an error message like below.

"VFS: Busy inodes after unmount of sdb. Self-destruct in 5 seconds.
Have a nice day..."
