btrfs: qgroup: Return actually freed bytes for qgroup release or free data

btrfs_qgroup_release/free_data() only returns 0 or a negative error
number (ENOMEM is the only possible error).

This is normally good enough, but sometimes we need the exact byte
count it freed/released.

Change it to return actually released/freed bytenr number instead of 0
for success.
And slightly modify related extent_changeset structure, since in btrfs
one no-hole data extent won't be larger than 128M, so "unsigned int"
is large enough for the use case.
