powerpc: Handle simultaneous interrupts at once

It often happens to have simultaneous interrupts, for instance
when having double Ethernet attachment. With the current
implementation, we suffer the cost of kernel entry/exit for each
interrupt.

This patch introduces a loop in __do_irq() to handle all interrupts
at once before returning.
