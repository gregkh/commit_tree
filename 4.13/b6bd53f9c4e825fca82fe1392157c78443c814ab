MIPS: Add missing file for eBPF JIT.

Inexplicably, commit f381bf6d82f0 ("MIPS: Add support for eBPF JIT.")
lost a file somewhere on its path to Linus' tree.  Add back the
missing ebpf_jit.c so that we can build with CONFIG_BPF_JIT selected.

This version of ebpf_jit.c is identical to the original except for two
minor change need to resolve conflicts with changes merged from the
BPF branch:

A) Set prog->jited_len = image_size;
B) Use BPF_TAIL_CALL instead of BPF_CALL | BPF_X

Fixes: f381bf6d82f0 ("MIPS: Add support for eBPF JIT.")
