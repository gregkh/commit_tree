kernel/watchdog: introduce arch_touch_nmi_watchdog()

For architectures that define HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG, instead of having them
provide the complete touch_nmi_watchdog() function, just have them
provide arch_touch_nmi_watchdog().

This gives the generic code more flexibility in implementing this
function, and arch implementations don't miss out on touching the
softlockup watchdog or other generic details.
