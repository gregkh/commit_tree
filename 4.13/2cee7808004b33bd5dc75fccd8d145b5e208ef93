scsi: lpfc: Fix counters so outstandng NVME IO count is accurate

NVME FC counters don't reflect actual results

Since counters are not atomic, or protected by a lock, the values often
get screwed up.

Make them atomic, like NVMET.  Fix up sysfs and debugfs display
accordingly Added Outstanding IOs to stats display
