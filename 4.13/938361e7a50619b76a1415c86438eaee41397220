drm/i915/cnp: Panel Power sequence changes for CNP PCH.

Panel Power sequences for CNP is similar to Broxton,
but with only one sequencer.

Main difference from SPT is that PP_DIVISOR was removed
and power cycle delay has been moved to PP_CONTROL.

v2: Add missed pp_div write, that is now part of PP_CONTROL[8:4]
    as on Broxton. (Found by DK)

v3: Improve commit message. (By DK)
