drm/i915: Apply the g4x TLB miss w/a to SR watermarks as well

The documentation I've seen doesn't actually specify which watermarks
need the TLB miss w/a. Currently we only apply the w/a to the normal
watermarks for both primary and cursor planes. Since the documentation
doesn't explicitly say anything I'm going to assume that the w/a should
equally apply to the SR/HPLL watermarks. So let's do that.
