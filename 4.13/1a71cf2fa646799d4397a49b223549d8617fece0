drm/i915: Allow execbuffer to use the first object as the batch

Currently, the last object in the execlist is the always the batch.
However, when building the batch buffer we often know the batch object
first and if we can use the first slot in the execlist we can emit
relocation instructions relative to it immediately and avoid a separate
pass to adjust the relocations to point to the last execlist slot.
