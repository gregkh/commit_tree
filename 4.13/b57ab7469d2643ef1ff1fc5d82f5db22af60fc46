scsi: lpfc: Fix vports not logging into target

vports cannot login to target.

For vports, lpfc_nodelist is allocated for targets only on completion of
GFF_ID command. Driver checks if lpfc_nodelist exists for target before
sending GFF_ID. So, GFF_ID and PLOGI are not sent.

As mentioned by the comment in lpfc_prep_node_fc4type() routine, do not
send GFF_ID only if this NPortID is previously identified as FCP
target. Send GFF_ID if it is a newly identified remote port from GID_FT
response.
