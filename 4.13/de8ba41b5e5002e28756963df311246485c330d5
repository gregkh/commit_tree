iwlwifi: mvm: support init flow debugging

In case an assert happens on init flow, the current
driver powers down the NIC, except if iwlmvm modparam
init_dbg=1, and only on very specific flows.

Extend this capability to cover most failure cases
by keeping track of what init configurations have been
completed. This way, we can allow NOT powering down
the NIC, while making sure that when the driver is
removed we don't try to free resources that haven't
been allocated. (This can result in a kernel panic.)
