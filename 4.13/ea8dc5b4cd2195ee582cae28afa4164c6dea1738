iscsi-target: fix memory leak in iscsit_setup_text_cmd()

On receiving text request iscsi-target allocates buffer for
payload in iscsit_handle_text_cmd() and assigns buffer pointer
to cmd->text_in_ptr, this buffer is currently freed in
iscsit_release_cmd(), if iscsi-target sets 'C' bit in text
response then it will receive another text request from the
initiator with ttt != 0xffffffff in this case iscsi-target
will find cmd using itt and call iscsit_setup_text_cmd()
which will set cmd->text_in_ptr to NULL without freeing
previously allocated buffer.

This patch fixes this issue by calling kfree(cmd->text_in_ptr)
in iscsit_setup_text_cmd() before assigning NULL to it.

For the first text request cmd->text_in_ptr is NULL as
cmd is memset to 0 in iscsit_allocate_cmd().
