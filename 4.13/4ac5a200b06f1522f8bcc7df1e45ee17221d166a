ARM: dts: qcom-msm8974: Add HS usb node and OTG detection mechanisms

This USB controller has two phys, so add them both underneath the
ULPI bus, but only enable one of them based on the board
configuration. To get OTG to work, we need to add the id and vbus
detection info and also populate the regulators for the vbus
supply.
