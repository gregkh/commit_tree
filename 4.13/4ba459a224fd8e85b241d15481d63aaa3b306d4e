drm/i915: Remove dead code from runtime resume handler

Remove the SNB PCH refclock init call from the runtime resume handler.
I don't think it was actually needed even when we had SNB runtime PM,
and if definitely isn't needed ever since SNB runtime PM was nuked in
commit d4c5636e7447 ("drm/i915: Remove runtime PM for SNB").
