nvme: provide UUID value to userspace

Now that we have a way for getting the UUID from a target, provide it
to userspace as well.

Unfortunately there is already a sysfs attribute called UUID which is
a misnomer as it holds the NGUID value. So instead of creating yet
another wrong name, create a new 'nguid' sysfs attribute for the
NGUID. For the UUID attribute add a check wheter the namespace has a
UUID assigned to it and return this or return the NGUID to maintain
backwards compatibility. This should give userspace a chance to catch
up.
