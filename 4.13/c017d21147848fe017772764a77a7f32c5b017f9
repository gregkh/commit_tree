irqchip: brcmstb-l2: Define an irq_pm_shutdown function

The Broadcom STB platforms support S5 and we allow specific hardware
wake-up events to take us out of this state. Because we were not
defining an irq_pm_shutdown() function pointer, we would not be
correctly masking non-wakeup events, which would result in spurious
wake-ups from sources that were not explicitly configured for wake-up.
