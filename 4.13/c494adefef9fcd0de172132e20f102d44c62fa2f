powerpc/64: Tool to check head sections location sanity

Use a tool to check that the location of "fixed sections" are where
we expected them to be, which catches cases the linker script can't
(stubs being added to start of .text section), and which ends up
being neater.

Sample output:

  ERROR: start_text address is c000000000008100, should be c000000000008000
  ERROR: see comments in arch/powerpc/tools/head_check.sh
