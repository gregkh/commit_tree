arm64: Call ARCH_WORKAROUND_2 on transitions between EL0 and EL1

In order for the kernel to protect itself, let's call the SSBD mitigation
implemented by the higher exception level (either hypervisor or firmware)
on each transition between userspace and kernel.

We must take the PSCI conduit into account in order to target the
right exception level, hence the introduction of a runtime patching
callback.
