scsi: cxlflash: Handle spurious interrupts

The following Oops can occur when there is heavy I/O traffic and the host is
reset by a tool such as sg_reset.

When a context is reset, the pending commands are flushed and the AFU is
notified. Before the AFU handles this request there could be command
completion interrupts queued to PHB which are yet to be delivered to the
context. In this scenario, a context could receive an interrupt for a command
that has been flushed, leading to a possible crash when the memory for the
flushed command is accessed.

To resolve this problem, a boolean will indicate if the hardware queue is
ready to process interrupts or not. This can be evaluated in the interrupt
handler before proessing an interrupt.
