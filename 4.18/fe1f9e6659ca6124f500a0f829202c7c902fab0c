nbd: fix how we set bd_invalidated

bd_invalidated is kind of a pain wrt partitions as it really only
triggers the partition rescan if it is set after bd_ops->open() runs, so
setting it when we reset the device isn't useful.  We also sporadically
would still have partitions left over in some disconnect cases, so fix
this by always setting bd_invalidated on open if there's no
configuration or if we've had a disconnect action happen, that way the
partition table gets invalidated and rescanned properly.
