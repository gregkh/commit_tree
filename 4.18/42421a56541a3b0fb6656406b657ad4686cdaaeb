tun: remove ndo_xdp_flush call tun_xdp_flush

Remove the ndo_xdp_flush call implementation tun_xdp_flush
as no callers of ndo_xdp_flush are left.

The tun drivers XDP_TX implementation also used tun_xdp_flush (and
tun_xdp_xmit).  This is easily solved by passing the XDP_XMIT_FLUSH
flag to tun_xdp_xmit in tun_xdp_tx.
