KVM: irqfd: fix race between EPOLLHUP and irq_bypass_register_consumer

A comment warning against this bug is there, but the code is not doing what
the comment says.  Therefore it is possible that an EPOLLHUP races against
irq_bypass_register_consumer.  The EPOLLHUP handler schedules irqfd_shutdown,
and if that runs soon enough, you get a use-after-free.
