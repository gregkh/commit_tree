selftests/x86: Detect -no-pie availability

Some toolchains need -no-pie to build all tests, others do not support
the -no-pie flag at all.  Therefore, add another test for the
availability of the flag.

This amends commit 3346a6a4e5ba8c040360f753b26938cec31a4bdc
("selftests: x86: sysret_ss_attrs doesn't build on a PIE build").
