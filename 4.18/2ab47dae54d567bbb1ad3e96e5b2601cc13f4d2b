apparmor: modify audit rule support to support profile stacks

Allows for audit rules, where a rule could specify a profile stack
A//&B, while extending the current semantic so if the label specified
in the audit rule is a subset of the secid it is considered a match.

Eg. if the secid resolves to the label stack A//&B//&C

Then an audit rule specifying a label of

  A - would match
  B - would match
  C - would match
  D - would not
  A//&B - would match as a subset
  A//&C - would match as a subset
  B//&C - would match as a subset
  A//&B//&C - would match

  A//&D - would not match, because while A does match, D is also
  specified and does not

Note: audit rules are currently assumed to be coming from the root
namespace.
