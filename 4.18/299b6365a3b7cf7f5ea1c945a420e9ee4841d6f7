brcmfmac: fix regression in parsing NVRAM for multiple devices

NVRAM is designed to work with Broadcom's SDK Linux kernel which fakes
PCI domain 0 for all internal MMIO devices. Since official Linux kernel
uses platform devices for that purpose there is a mismatch in numbering
PCI domains.

There used to be a fix for that problem but it was accidentally dropped
during the last firmware loading rework. That resulted in brcmfmac not
being able to extract device specific NVRAM content and all kind of
calibration problems.
