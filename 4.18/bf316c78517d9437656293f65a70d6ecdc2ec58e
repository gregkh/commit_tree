scsi: lpfc: Fix WQ/CQ creation for older asic's.

The patch to enlarge WQ/CQ creation keys off of an adapter response that
indicates support for the larger values. Older adapters return an
incorrect response and are limited in size.  Thus the adapters fail the
WQ creation steps.

Augment the WQ sizing checks with a check on the older adapter types and
limit them to the restricted sizes.
