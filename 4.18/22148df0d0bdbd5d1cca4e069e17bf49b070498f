r8169: don't use netif_info et al before net_device has been registered

There's no benefit in using netif_info et al before the net_device has
been registered. We get messages like
r8169 0000:03:00.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): [message]
Therefore use dev_info/dev_err instead.

As a side effect we don't need parameter dev for function
rtl8169_get_mac_version() any longer.
