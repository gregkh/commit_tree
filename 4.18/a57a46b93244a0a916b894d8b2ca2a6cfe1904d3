ALSA: hda/ca0132: Fix DMic data rate for Alienware M17x R4

The commentary says to use various parameters, and lays out what
the mapping is...  The code used a 32KHz rate when the comment
says that it needs to use a 48KHz rate.  And this has been the
case since day one.

On the Alienware M17x R4, the DMic used to have exceptionally quiet
pickup and a lot of noise.  Changing the data rate fixes both of
these issues.

Searching the kernel bug tracker for ca0132-related issues shows no
mention of this being an issue for other hardware, and I have no
other hardware to test with, so a quirk is used to limit the effect
to just the M17x R4.
