net: bridge: Notify about bridge VLANs

A driver might need to react to changes in settings of brentry VLANs.
Therefore send switchdev port notifications for these as well. Reuse
SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_PORT_VLAN for this purpose. Listeners should use
netif_is_bridge_master() on orig_dev to determine whether the
notification is about a bridge port or a bridge.
