mm: fix devmem_is_allowed() for sub-page System RAM intersections

Hussam reports:

    I was poking around and for no real reason, I did cat /dev/mem and
    strings /dev/mem.  Then I saw the following warning in dmesg. I saved it
    and rebooted immediately.

     memremap attempted on mixed range 0x000000000009c000 size: 0x1000
     ------------[ cut here ]------------
     WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11810 at kernel/memremap.c:98 memremap+0x104/0x170
     [..]
     Call Trace:
      xlate_dev_mem_ptr+0x25/0x40
      read_mem+0x89/0x1a0
      __vfs_read+0x36/0x170

The memremap() implementation checks for attempts to remap System RAM
with MEMREMAP_WB and instead redirects those mapping attempts to the
linear map.  However, that only works if the physical address range
being remapped is page aligned.  In low memory we have situations like
the following:

    00000000-00000fff : Reserved
    00001000-0009fbff : System RAM
    0009fc00-0009ffff : Reserved

...where System RAM intersects Reserved ranges on a sub-page page
granularity.

Given that devmem_is_allowed() special cases any attempt to map System
RAM in the first 1MB of memory, replace page_is_ram() with the more
precise region_intersects() to trap attempts to map disallowed ranges.
