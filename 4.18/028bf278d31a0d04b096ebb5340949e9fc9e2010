KVM: arm/arm64: Adapt vgic_v3_check_base to multiple rdist regions

vgic_v3_check_base() currently only handles the case of a unique
legacy redistributor region whose size is not explicitly set but
inferred, instead, from the number of online vcpus.

We adapt it to handle the case of multiple redistributor regions
with explicitly defined size. We rely on two new helpers:
- vgic_v3_rdist_overlap() is used to detect overlap with the dist
  region if defined
- vgic_v3_rd_region_size computes the size of the redist region,
  would it be a legacy unique region or a new explicitly sized
  region.
