time: Introduce CONFIG_64BIT_TIME in architectures

There are a total of 53 system calls (aside from ioctl) that pass a time_t
or derived data structure as an argument, and in order to extend time_t
to 64-bit, we have to replace them with new system calls and keep providing
backwards compatibility.

To avoid adding completely new and untested code for this purpose, we
introduce a new CONFIG_64BIT_TIME symbol. Every architecture that supports
new 64 bit time_t syscalls enables this config.

After this is done for all architectures, the CONFIG_64BIT_TIME symbol
will be deleted.
