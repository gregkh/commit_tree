arm64: dts: hikey: Define wl1835 power capabilities

These properties are required for compatibility with runtime PM.
Without these properties, MMC host controller will not be aware
of power capabilities. When the wlcore driver attempts to power
on the device, it will erroneously fail with -EACCES.
