bpf: btf: Fix bitfield extraction for big endian

When extracting bitfield from a number, btf_int_bits_seq_show() builds
a mask and accesses least significant byte of the number in a way
specific to little-endian. This patch fixes that by checking endianness
of the machine and then shifting left and right the unneeded bits.

Thanks to Martin Lau for the help in navigating potential pitfalls when
dealing with endianess and for the final solution.
