dma-debug: check scatterlist segments

Drivers/subsystems creating scatterlists for DMA should be taking care
to respect the scatter-gather limitations of the appropriate device, as
described by dma_parms. A DMA API implementation cannot feasibly split
a scatterlist into *more* entries than originally passed, so it is not
well defined what they should do when given a segment larger than the
limit they are also required to respect.

Conversely, devices which are less limited than the rather conservative
defaults, or indeed have no limitations at all (e.g. GPUs with their own
internal MMU), should be encouraged to set appropriate dma_parms, as
they may get more efficient DMA mapping performance out of it.
