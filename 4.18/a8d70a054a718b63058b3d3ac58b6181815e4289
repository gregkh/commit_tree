net/mlx5: E-Switch, Disallow vlan/spoofcheck setup if not being esw manager

In smartnic env, if the host (PF) driver is not an e-switch manager, we
are not allowed to apply eswitch ports setups such as vlan (VST),
spoof-checks, min/max rate or state.

Make sure we are eswitch manager when coming to issue these callbacks
and err otherwise.

Also fix the definition of ESW_ALLOWED to rely on eswitch_manager
capability and on the vport_group_manger.

Operations on the VF nic vport context, such as setting a mac or reading
the vport counters are allowed to the PF in this scheme.

The modify nic vport guid code was modified to omit checking the
nic_vport_node_guid_modify eswitch capability.
The reason for doing so is that modifying node guid requires vport group
manager capability, and there's no need to check further capabilities.

1. set_vf_vlan     - disallowed
2. set_vf_spoofchk - disallowed
3. set_vf_mac      - allowed
4. get_vf_config   - allowed
5. set_vf_trust    - disallowed
6. set_vf_rate     - disallowed
7. get_vf_stat     - allowed
8. set_vf_link_state - disallowed
