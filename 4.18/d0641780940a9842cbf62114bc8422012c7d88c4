xfs: simplify xfs_file_iomap_begin() logic

The current logic that determines whether allocation should be done
has grown somewhat spaghetti like with the addition of IOMAP_NOWAIT
functionality. Separate out each of the different cases into single,
obvious checks to get rid most of the nested IOMAP_NOWAIT checks
in the allocation logic.
