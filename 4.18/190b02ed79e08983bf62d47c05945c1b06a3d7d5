block: fix use-after-free in block flush handling

A recent commit reused the original request flags for the flush
queue handling. However, for some of the kick flush cases, the
original request was already completed. This caused a use after
free, if blk-mq wasn't used.

Fixes: 84fca1b0c461 ("block: pass failfast and driver-specific flags to flush requests")
