net: hns3: Fix for service_task not running problem after resetting

When hclge_ae_stop is called during resetting, it will cancel the
service_task by calling cancel_work_sync, which may cause the
service_task to exit without clearing HCLGE_STATE_SERVICE_SCHED
bit. If this happens, the service_task will never run again.

This patch fixes this problem by clearing it after calling
cancel_work_sync in hclge_ae_stop.
