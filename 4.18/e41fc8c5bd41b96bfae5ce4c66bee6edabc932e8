ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix the problem of two front mics on more machines

We have 3 more Lenovo machines, they all have 2 front mics on them,
so they need the fixup to change the location for one of two mics.

Among these 3 Lenovo machines, one of them has the same pin cfg as the
machine with subid 0x17aa3138, so use the pin cfg table to apply fixup
for them. The rest machines don't share the same pin cfg, so far use
the subid to apply fixup for them.
