media: staging: atomisp: add missing include

There are two functions used externally:
	drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp2/atomisp_compat_ioctl32.c:866:6: warning: symbol 'atomisp_do_compat_ioctl' was not declared. Should it be static?
	drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp2/atomisp_compat_ioctl32.c:1110:6: warning: symbol 'atomisp_compat_ioctl32' was not declared. Should it be static?

whose include header is missing. Add it.
