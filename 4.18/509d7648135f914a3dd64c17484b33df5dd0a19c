xsk: do not return ENXIO from TX copy mode

This patch removes the ENXIO return code from TX copy-mode when
someone has forcefully changed the number of queues on the device so
that the queue bound to the socket is no longer available. Just
silently stop sending anything as in zero-copy mode so the error
reporting gets consistent between the two modes.
