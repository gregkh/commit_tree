scsi: lpfc: Correct missing remoteport registration during link bounces

Remote port disappearance/reappearances would cause a series of RSCN
events to be delivered to the driver. During the resulting GID_FT
handling, the driver clears the fc4 settings on the remote port, which
makes it skip registration. As such, the nvme associations eventually
fail and return io errors to the applications.

Correct by not clearng the nlp_fc4_types for all nodes in
lpfc_issue_gidft.  Instead, when the GID_FT response is handled, clear
the nlp_fc4_types of FCP and NVME prior to evaluating the fc4_type
returned by the GID_FT response.  This approach leaves "skipped" nodes
with their nlp_fc4_types intacted.
