sparc32/PCI/PCIC: Converge device enable path

Most architectures turn on PCI_COMMAND_IO and PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY in
pci_enable_device() when a driver claims the device.  Sparc PCIC did it in
pcibios_fixup_bus(), which is called during enumeration, before any drivers
are attached.

Implement pcibios_enable_device() for PCIC so it will do the same as other
architectures.  This implementation is copied verbatim from sparc64.
