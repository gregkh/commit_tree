staging/rtl8192u: simplify procfs code

Unwind the registration loop into individual calls.  Switch to use
proc_create_single where applicable.

Also don't bother handling proc_create* failures - the driver works
perfectly fine without the proc files, and the cleanup will handle
missing files gracefully.
