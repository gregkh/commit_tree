ACPI / LPSS: Avoid PM quirks on suspend and resume from hibernation

Commit a09c59130688 (ACPI / LPSS: Avoid PM quirks on suspend and
resume from S3) modified the ACPI driver for Intel SoCs (LPSS) to
avoid applying PM quirks on suspend and resume from S3 to address
system-wide suspend and resume problems on some systems, but it is
reported that the same issue also affects hibernation, so extend
the approach used by that commit to cover hibernation as well.
