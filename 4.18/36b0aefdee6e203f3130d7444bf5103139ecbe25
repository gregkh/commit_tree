soc: qcom: cmd-db: Make endian-agnostic

This driver deals with memory that is stored in little-endian format.
Update the structures with the proper little-endian types and then
do the proper conversions when reading the fields. Note that we compare
the ids with a memcmp() because we already pad out the string 'id' field
to exactly 8 bytes with the strncpy() onto the stack.
