staging: ks7010: avoid casts in michael_mic_function calls

This commit removes casts in calls to michael_mic_function.
Most of them are nosense because types match perfectly function
parameters. To avoid also int casting for len parameter just
pass unsigned len to function which makes sense because is only
being called with unsigned int len parameters.
