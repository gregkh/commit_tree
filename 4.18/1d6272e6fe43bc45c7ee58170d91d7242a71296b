kconfig: add 'info', 'warning-if', and 'error-if' built-in functions

Syntax:
  $(info,<text>)
  $(warning-if,<condition>,<text>)
  $(error-if,<condition>,<text)

The 'info' function prints a message to stdout as in Make.

The 'warning-if' and 'error-if' are similar to 'warning' and 'error'
in Make, but take the condition parameter.  They are effective only
when the <condition> part is y.

Kconfig does not implement the lazy expansion as used in the 'if'
'and, 'or' functions in Make.  In other words, Kconfig does not
support conditional expansion.  The unconditional 'error' function
would always terminate the parsing, hence would be useless in Kconfig.
