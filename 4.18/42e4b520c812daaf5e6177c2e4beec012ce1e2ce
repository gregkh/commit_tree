btrfs: Add unprivileged ioctl which returns subvolume's ROOT_REF

Add unprivileged ioctl BTRFS_IOC_GET_SUBVOL_ROOTREF which returns
ROOT_REF information of the subvolume containing this inode except the
subvolume name (this is because to prevent potential name leak). The
subvolume name will be gained by user version of ino_lookup ioctl
(BTRFS_IOC_INO_LOOKUP_USER) which also performs permission check.

The min id of root ref's subvolume to be searched is specified by
@min_id in struct btrfs_ioctl_get_subvol_rootref_args. After the search
ends, @min_id is set to the last searched root ref's subvolid + 1. Also,
if there are more root refs than BTRFS_MAX_ROOTREF_BUFFER_NUM,
-EOVERFLOW is returned. Therefore the caller can just call this ioctl
again without changing the argument to continue search.
