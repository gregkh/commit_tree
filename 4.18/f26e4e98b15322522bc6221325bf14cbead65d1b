batman-adv: Avoid old nodes disabling multicast optimizations completely

Instead of disabling multicast optimizations mesh-wide once a node with
no multicast optimizations capabilities joins the mesh, do the
following:

Just insert such nodes into the WANT_ALL_IPV4/IPV6 lists. This is
sufficient to avoid multicast packet loss to such unsupportive nodes.
