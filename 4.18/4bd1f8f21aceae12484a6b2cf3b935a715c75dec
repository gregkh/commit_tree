tools/power turbostat: Fix --hide Pk%pc10

The column header for PC10 residency is "Pk%pc10"
This is missing the 'g' that others have, eg Pkg%pc6,
to allow tab-delimited columns to fit into 8-columns.

However, --hide Pk%pc10 did not work, it was still looking for the 'g'.
This was confusing, because --list shows the correct "Pk%pc10"
