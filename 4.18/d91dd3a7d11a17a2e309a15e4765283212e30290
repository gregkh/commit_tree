scsi: cxlflash: Update synchronous interrupt status bits

The SISLite specification has been updated to define new synchronous interrupt
status bits. These bits are set by the AFU when a given PASID or EA is bad and
a synchronous interrupt is triggered.

The SISLite header file is updated to support these new bits. Note that there
are also some formatting updates to some of the existing bits to allow all of
the definitions to line up uniformly.
