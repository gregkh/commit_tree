ARM: dts: meson8m2: add support for the Tronsmart MXIII Plus

The Tronsmart MXIII Plus is an Android TV box which uses the Amlogic
S812 (Meson8m2) SoC. It uses a Realtek RTL8211F RGMII Ethernet PHY as
well as a Ricoh RN5T618 system power controller. It also comes with an
Ampak AP6330 SDIO wifi/Bluetooth combo chip (support for wifi and
Bluetooth is currently not added because the Linux drivers currently
only support one MMC controller and that is used for the SD card).
