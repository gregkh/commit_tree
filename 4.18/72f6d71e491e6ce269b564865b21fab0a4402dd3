vxlan: add ttl inherit support

Like tos inherit, ttl inherit should also means inherit the inner protocol's
ttl values, which actually not implemented in vxlan yet.

But we could not treat ttl == 0 as "use the inner TTL", because that would be
used also when the "ttl" option is not specified and that would be a behavior
change, and breaking real use cases.

So add a different attribute IFLA_VXLAN_TTL_INHERIT when "ttl inherit" is
specified with ip cmd.
