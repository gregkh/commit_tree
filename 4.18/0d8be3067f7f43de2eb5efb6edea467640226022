staging: ks7010: change parameter types in hostif_power_mgmt_request

Parameters for hostif_power_mgmt_request are declared as unsigned
long and then are forced to be change to be u32. Also the caller
declares explicitly unsigned long parameters just to assign them
and pass into the function. Change types for those to be u32 instead
so no conversion is needed at all and code gets more clear.
