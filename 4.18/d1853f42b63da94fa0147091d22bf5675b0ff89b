drm/amdkfd: GFP_NOIO while holding locks taken in MMU notifier

When an MMU notifier runs in memory reclaim context, it can deadlock
trying to take locks that are already held in the thread causing the
memory reclaim. The solution is to avoid memory reclaim while holding
locks that are taken in MMU notifiers by using GFP_NOIO.

This commit fixes memory allocations done while holding the dqm->lock
which is needed in the MMU notifier (dqm->ops.evict_process_queues).
