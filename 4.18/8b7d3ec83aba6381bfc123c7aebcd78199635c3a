drm/exynos: gsc: Convert driver to IPP v2 core API

This patch adapts Exynos DRM GScaler driver to new IPP v2 core API.
The side effect of this conversion is a switch to driver component API
to register properly in the Exynos DRM core. During the conversion
driver has been adapted to support more specific compatible strings
to distinguish between Exynos5250 and Exynos5420 (different hardware
limits). Support for Exynos5433 variant has been added too
(different limits table, removed dependency on ARCH_EXYNOS5).
