ARM: Allow this header to be included by assembly files

The constants defined in this file are equally useful in assembly and C
source files. The arm64 architecture version of this file allows
inclusion in both assembly and C source files, so this commit adds
that capability to the arm architecture version so that the constants
don't need to be defined in multiple places.
