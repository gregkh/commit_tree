btrfs: track running balance in a simpler way

Currently fs_info::balance_running is 0 or 1 and does not use the
semantics of atomics. The pause and cancel check for 0, that can happen
only after __btrfs_balance exits for whatever reason.

Parallel calls to balance ioctl may enter btrfs_ioctl_balance multiple
times but will block on the balance_mutex that protects the
fs_info::flags bit.
