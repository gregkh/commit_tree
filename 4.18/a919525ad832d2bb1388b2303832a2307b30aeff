net: Move fib_convert_metrics to metrics file

Move logic of fib_convert_metrics into ip_metrics_convert. This allows
the code that converts netlink attributes into metrics struct to be
re-used in a later patch by IPv6.

This is mostly a code move with the following changes to variable names:
  - fi->fib_net becomes net
  - fc_mx and fc_mx_len are passed as inputs pulled from fib_config
  - metrics array is passed as an input from fi->fib_metrics->metrics
