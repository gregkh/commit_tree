arm64: dma-mapping: clear buffers allocated with FORCE_CONTIGUOUS flag

dma_alloc_*() buffers might be exposed to userspace via mmap() call, so
they should be cleared on allocation. In case of IOMMU-based dma-mapping
implementation such buffer clearing was missing in the code path for
DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS flag handling, because dma_alloc_from_contiguous()
doesn't honor __GFP_ZERO flag. This patch fixes this issue. For more
information on clearing buffers allocated by dma_alloc_* functions,
see commit 6829e274a623 ("arm64: dma-mapping: always clear allocated
buffers").
