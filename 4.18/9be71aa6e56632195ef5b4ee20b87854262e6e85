selftests/bpf: Prepare test_sock_addr for extension

test_sock_addr was not easy to extend since it was focused on sys_bind
and sys_connect quite a bit.

Reorganized it so that it'll be easier to cover new test-cases for
`BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR`:

- decouple test-cases so that only one BPF prog is tested at a time;

- check programmatically that local IP:port for sys_bind, source IP and
  destination IP:port for sys_connect are rewritten property by tested
  BPF programs.

The output of new version:
  # test_sock_addr.sh 2>/dev/null
  Wait for testing IPv4/IPv6 to become available ... OK
