bpf: Introduce BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR

This patch introduces BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR to signal the
bpf loader about the btf key_type and value_type of a bpf map.
Please refer to the changes in test_btf_haskv.c for its usage.
Both iproute2 and libbpf loader will then have the same
convention to find out the map's btf_key_type_id and
btf_value_type_id from a map's name.
