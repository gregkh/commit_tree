mlxsw: pci: Allow to use CQEs of version 1 and version 2

Use previously added resources to query FW support for multiple versions
of CQEs. Use the biggest version supported. For SDQs, it has no sense to
use version 2 as it does not introduce any new features, but it is
twice the size of CQE version 1.
