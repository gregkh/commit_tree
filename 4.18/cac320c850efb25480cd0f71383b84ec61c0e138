virtio_net: convert to use generic xdp_frame and xdp_return_frame API

The virtio_net driver assumes XDP frames are always released based on
page refcnt (via put_page).  Thus, is only queues the XDP data pointer
address and uses virt_to_head_page() to retrieve struct page.

Use the XDP return API to get away from such assumptions. Instead
queue an xdp_frame, which allow us to use the xdp_return_frame API,
when releasing the frame.

V9: Change __virtnet_xdp_xmit from bool to int return value (found by Dan Carpenter)
