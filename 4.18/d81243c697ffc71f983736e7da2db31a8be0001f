CIFS: 511c54a2f69195b28afb9dd119f03787b1625bb4 adds a check for session expiry, status STATUS_NETWORK_SESSION_EXPIRED, however the server can also respond with STATUS_USER_SESSION_DELETED in cases where the session has been idle for some time and the server reaps the session to recover resources.

Handle this additional status in the same way as SESSION_EXPIRED.
