KVM: nVMX: Emulate L1 individual-address invvpid by L0 individual-address invvpid

When vmcs12 uses VPID, all TLB entries populated by L2 are tagged with
vmx->nested.vpid02. Currently, INVVPID executed by L1 is emulated by L0
by using INVVPID single/global-context to flush all TLB entries
tagged with vmx->nested.vpid02 regardless of INVVPID type executed by
L1.

However, we can easily optimize the case of L1 INVVPID on an
individual-address. Just INVVPID given individual-address tagged with
vmx->nested.vpid02.
