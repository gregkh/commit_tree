samples/bpf: Add example of ipv4 and ipv6 forwarding in XDP

Simple example of fast-path forwarding. It has a serious flaw
in not verifying the egress device index supports XDP forwarding.
If the egress device does not packets are dropped.

Take this only as a simple example of fast-path forwarding.
