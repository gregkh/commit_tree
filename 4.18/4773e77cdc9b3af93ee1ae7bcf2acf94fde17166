ACPI / CPPC: Add support for CPPC v3

CPPC V3 introduces two new entries to make it easier to convert between
abstract processor performance and frequency. The two new entries are
lowest frequency and nominal frequency. These are the frequencies
corresponding to lowest and nominal abstract performance.

Add support to read the new entries and populate them as part of the
CPPC performance capabilities which can be used by cpufreq drivers
