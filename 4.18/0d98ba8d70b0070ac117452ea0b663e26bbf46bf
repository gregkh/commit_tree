scsi: hpsa: disable device during shutdown

'Commit cc27b735ad3a ("PCI/portdrv: Turn off PCIe services during
shutdown")' has been added to kernel to shutdown pending PCIe port service
interrupts during reboot so that a newly started kexec kernel wouldn't
observe pending interrupts.

pcie_port_device_remove() is disabling the root port and switches by
calling pci_disable_device() after all PCIe service drivers are shutdown.

This has been found to cause crashes on HP DL360 Gen9 machines during
reboot due to hpsa driver not clearing the bus master bit during the
shutdown procedure by calling pci_disable_device().

Disable device as part of the shutdown sequence.
