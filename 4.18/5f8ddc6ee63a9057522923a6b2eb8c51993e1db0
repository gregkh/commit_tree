ALSA: hda/ca0132: Restore PCM Analog Mic-In2

Commit 009b8f979bf8cb5f7ec6d3dd7683585122ed10f8 conditionalized
adding the "CA0132 Analog Mic-In2" PCM with a comment to the
effect that, "desktops don't use this ADC", but the test was set
up such that the ADC was only created for desktops.  Invert the
test.
