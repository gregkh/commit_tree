backlight: as3711_bl: Fix Device Tree node leaks

Two framebuffer device-node names were looked up during probe, but were
only used as flags to indicate the presence of two framebuffer device.

Drop the unused framebuffer name along with a likewise unused device
pointer from the driver data, and update the platform data to pass in
booleans instead of the framebuffer strings. This allows us do drop the
node references acquired during probe, which would otherwise leak.

Note that there are no other in-kernel users of the modified
platform-data fields.
