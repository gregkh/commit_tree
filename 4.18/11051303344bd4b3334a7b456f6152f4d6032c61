drm/i915/perf: simplify OA unit enabling on gen7

In commit d79651522e89c ("drm/i915: Enable i915 perf stream for
Haswell OA unit") the enable/disable vfunc hadn't appear yet and the
same function would deal with enabling/disabling the OA unit.

This was split later on for gen8 but the gen7 retained some code that
isn't actually useful anymore.
