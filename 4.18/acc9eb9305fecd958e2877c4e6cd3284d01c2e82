KVM: PPC: Reimplement LOAD_VMX/STORE_VMX instruction mmio emulation with analyse_instr() input

This patch reimplements LOAD_VMX/STORE_VMX MMIO emulation with
analyse_instr() input. When emulating the store, the VMX reg will need to
be flushed so that the right reg val can be retrieved before writing to
IO MEM.

This patch also adds support for lvebx/lvehx/lvewx/stvebx/stvehx/stvewx
MMIO emulation. To meet the requirement of handling different element
sizes, kvmppc_handle_load128_by2x64()/kvmppc_handle_store128_by2x64()
were replaced with kvmppc_handle_vmx_load()/kvmppc_handle_vmx_store().

The framework used is similar to VSX instruction MMIO emulation.
