tipc: correct discovery message handling during address trial period

With the duplicate address discovery protocol for tipc nodes addresses
we introduced a one second trial period before a node is allocated a
hash number to use as address.

Unfortunately, we miss to handle the case when a regular LINK REQUEST/
RESPONSE arrives from a cluster node during the trial period. Such
messages are not ignored as they should be, leading to links setup
attempts while the node still has no address.
