powerpc/xive: Remove (almost) unused macros

The GETFIELD and SETFIELD macros in xive-regs.h aren't used except for
a single instance of GETFIELD, so replace that and remove them.

These macros are also defined in vas.h, so either those should be
eventually replaced or the macros moved into bitops.h.
