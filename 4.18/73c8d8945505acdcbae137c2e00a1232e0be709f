ring_buffer: tracing: Inherit the tracing setting to next ring buffer

Maintain the tracing on/off setting of the ring_buffer when switching
to the trace buffer snapshot.

Taking a snapshot is done by swapping the backup ring buffer
(max_tr_buffer). But since the tracing on/off setting is defined
by the ring buffer, when swapping it, the tracing on/off setting
can also be changed. This causes a strange result like below:

  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat tracing_on
  1
  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 0 > tracing_on
  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat tracing_on
  0
  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 > snapshot
  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat tracing_on
  1
  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 > snapshot
  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat tracing_on
  0

We don't touch tracing_on, but snapshot changes tracing_on
setting each time. This is an anomaly, because user doesn't know
that each "ring_buffer" stores its own tracing-enable state and
the snapshot is done by swapping ring buffers.
