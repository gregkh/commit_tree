ext4: update mtime in ext4_punch_hole even if no blocks are released

Currently in ext4_punch_hole we're going to skip the mtime update if
there are no actual blocks to release. However we've actually modified
the file by zeroing the partial block so the mtime should be updated.

Moreover the sync and datasync handling is skipped as well, which is
also wrong. Fix it.
