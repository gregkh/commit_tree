net: qualcomm: rmnet: Add support for ethtool private stats

Add ethtool private stats handler to debug the handling of packets
with checksum offload header / trailer. This allows to keep track of
the number of packets for which hardware computes the checksum and
counts and reasons where checksum computation was skipped in hardware
and was done in the network stack.
