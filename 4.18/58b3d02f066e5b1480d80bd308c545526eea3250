Revert "drm/sun4i: Handle DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_*EDGE"

This reverts commit 2c17a4368aad2b88b68e4390c819e226cf320f70.

The offending commit triggers a run-time fault when accessing the panel
element of the sun4i_tcon structure when no such panel is attached.

It was apparently assumed in said commit that a panel is always used with
the TCON. Although it is often the case, this is not always true.
For instance a bridge might be used instead of a panel.

This issue was discovered using an A13-OLinuXino, that uses the TCON
in RGB mode for a simple DAC-based VGA bridge.
