ASoC: rsnd: don't assume node full path name for HDMI probing

Current ssi.c is assuming below 2 things to probing HDMI node.
1) remote node is including "hdmi0" or "hdmi1" in node name
2) remote_ep->full_name is including full path name

But, these assumptions are broken by below
1) Node names should not use numerical suffixes
 commit 6b5ac2f1cb11 ("arm64: dts: renesas: r8a7795: Drop bogus HDMI
                       node names suffixes")
2) node full_name no longer include full path name
 commit a7e4cfb0a7ca ("of/fdt: only store the device node basename
                       in full_name")

Because of these reasons, ssi.c can't probe HDMI on current kernel.
This patch probes HDMI0/1 by using its address.
Note is that we need to keep updating for this address for future
generation chip.
