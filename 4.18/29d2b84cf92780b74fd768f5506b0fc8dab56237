btrfs: Replace owner argument in add_pinned_bytes with a boolean

add_pinned_bytes really cares whether the bytes being pinned are either
data or metadata. To that effect it checks whether the 'owner' argument
is less than BTRFS_FIRST_FREE_OBJECTID (256). This works because
owner can really have 2 types of values:

 a) For metadata extents it holds the level at which the parent is in
    the btree. This amounts to owner having the values 0-7

 b) In case of modifying data extents, owner is the inode number
    to which those extents belongs.

Let's make this more explicit byt converting the owner parameter to a
boolean value and either pass it directly when we know the type of
extents we are working with (i.e. in btrfs_free_tree_block). In cases
when the parent function can be called on both metadata/data extents
perform the check in the caller. This hopefully makes the interface
of add_pinned_bytes more intuitive.
