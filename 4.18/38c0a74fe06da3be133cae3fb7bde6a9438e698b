MIPS: Fix off-by-one in pci_resource_to_user()

The MIPS implementation of pci_resource_to_user() introduced in v3.12 by
commit 4c2924b725fb ("MIPS: PCI: Use pci_resource_to_user to map pci
memory space properly") incorrectly sets *end to the address of the
byte after the resource, rather than the last byte of the resource.

This results in userland seeing resources as a byte larger than they
actually are, for example a 32 byte BAR will be reported by a tool such
as lspci as being 33 bytes in size:

    Region 2: I/O ports at 1000 [disabled] [size=33]

Correct this by subtracting one from the calculated end address,
reporting the correct address to userland.
