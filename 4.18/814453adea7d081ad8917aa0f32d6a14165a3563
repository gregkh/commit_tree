earlycon: Initialize port->uartclk based on clock-frequency property

On DT based platforms when current-speed property is present baudrate
is setup. Also port->uartclk is initialized to bogus BASE_BAUD * 16
value. Drivers like uartps/ns16550 contain logic when baudrate and
uartclk is used for baudrate calculation.

The patch is reading optional clock-frequency property to replace bogus
BASE_BAUD * 16 calculation to have proper baudrate calculation.
