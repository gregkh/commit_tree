rsi: roaming enhancements

To support roaming below changes are done:
* Station notify frame is send to firmware after sending assoc
  request. This will avoid dropping of first EAPOL frame due to
  delay in creation of station control block in firmware.
* Data queues are unblocked after sending station notify in open
  mode, after configuring key in WEP mode, and after receiving
  EAPOL4 confirm in WPA mode.
* Initial EAPOL frames priority is chaged to MGMT, rekey EAPOL
  frames priority changed to VO.
