scsi: aacraid: Fix PD performance regression over incorrect qd being set

The driver fails to set the correct queue depth for native devices, due to
failing to set the device type prior to calling aac_set_safw_target_qd().
This results in slave configure setting the queue depth to 1.

This causes around 30% performance degradation. Fixed by setting the dev
type before trying to set queue depth.
