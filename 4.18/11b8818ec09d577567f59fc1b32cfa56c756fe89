fscrypt: remove internal key size constants

With one exception, the internal key size constants such as
FS_AES_256_XTS_KEY_SIZE are only used for the 'available_modes' array,
where they really only serve to obfuscate what the values are.  Also
some of the constants are unused, and the key sizes tend to be in the
names of the algorithms anyway.  In the past these values were also
misused, e.g. we used to have FS_AES_256_XTS_KEY_SIZE in places that
technically should have been FS_MAX_KEY_SIZE.

The exception is that FS_AES_128_ECB_KEY_SIZE is used for key
derivation.  But it's more appropriate to use
FS_KEY_DERIVATION_NONCE_SIZE for that instead.

Thus, just put the sizes directly in the 'available_modes' array.
