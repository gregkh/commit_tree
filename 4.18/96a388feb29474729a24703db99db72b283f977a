ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Unify BYTCR input defaults

Currently we've 2 places with BYTCR defaults: 1. The generic catch-all
DMI_SYS_VENDOR=="Insyde" DMI quirk which selects SSP0-AIF1 for generic
Insyde BYTCR tablets without the ACPI channel package; and 2. the
defaults in the if (is_bytcr) {} code block.

Currently these are not identical, both select IN3 as the internal mic
output, but the "Insyde" DMI quirk leaves out the DIFF_MIC quirk. The
DIFF_MIC quirk should be enabled by default, because enabling diff. input
helps a lot for devices with a differential mic, where as it is a nop on
devices with a normal mic.

This commit adds the DIFF_MIC quirk to the "Insyde" DMI quirk path, by
adding a new BYTCR_INPUT_DEFAULTS define and using that in both code paths
which set BYTCR defaults.

Having a single place where the BYTCR input defaults are defined also
allows defining jack-detect defaults in a single place in a follow-up
commit.
