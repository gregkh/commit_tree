USB: serial: option: blacklist unused dwm-158 interfaces

The dwm-158 interface 4 and 5 doesn't answer to the AT commands
and doesn't appears a option interface.
Tested on openwrt distribution (kernel 4.14 using the old blacklist
definitions).

Lars Melin also writes:

	Blacklisting interface 4 and 5 is correct because:

	MI_00 D-Link Mobile Broadband Device  (cdc_ether)
	MI_02 D-Link HSPA+DataCard Diagnostics Interface (also ppp modem)
	MI_03 D-Link HSPA+DataCard NMEA Device
	MI_04 D-Link HSPA+DataCard Speech Port
	MI_05 D-Link HSPA+DataCard Debug Port
	MI_06 USB Mass Storage Device
