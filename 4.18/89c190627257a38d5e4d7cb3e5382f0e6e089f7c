powerpc/prom: Drop support for old FDT versions

In commit e6a6928c3ea1 ("of/fdt: Convert FDT functions to use
libfdt") (Apr 2014), the generic flat device tree code dropped support
for flat device tree's older than version 0x10 (16).

We still have code in our CPU scanning to cope with flat device tree
versions earlier than 2, which can now never trigger, so drop it.
