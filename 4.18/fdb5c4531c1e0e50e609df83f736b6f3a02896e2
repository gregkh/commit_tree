bpf: fix attach type BPF_LIRC_MODE2 dependency wrt CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF

If the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF not enabled, it is not
possible to attach, detach or query IR BPF programs to /dev/lircN devices,
making them impossible to use. For embedded devices, it should be possible
to use IR decoding without cgroups or CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF enabled.

This change requires some refactoring, since bpf_prog_{attach,detach,query}
functions are now always compiled, but their code paths for cgroups need
moving out. Rather than a #ifdef CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF in kernel/bpf/syscall.c,
moving them to kernel/bpf/cgroup.c and kernel/bpf/sockmap.c does not
require #ifdefs since that is already conditionally compiled.
