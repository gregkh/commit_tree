i40e: avoid overflow in i40e_ptp_adjfreq()

When operating at 1GbE, the base incval for the PTP clock is so large
that multiplying it by numbers close to the max_adj can overflow the
u64.

Rather than attempting to limit the max_adj to a value small enough to
avoid overflow, instead calculate the incvalue adjustment based on the
40GbE incvalue, and then multiply that by the scaling factor for the
link speed.

This sacrifices a small amount of precision in the adjustment but we
avoid erratic behavior of the clock due to the overflow caused if ppb is
very near the maximum adjustment.
