samples/bpf: move common-purpose trace functions to selftests

There is no functionality change in this patch. The common-purpose
trace functions, including perf_event polling and ksym lookup,
are moved from trace_output_user.c and bpf_load.c to
selftests/bpf/trace_helpers.c so that these function can
be reused later in selftests.
