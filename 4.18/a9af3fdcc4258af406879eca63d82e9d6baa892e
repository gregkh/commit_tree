f2fs: fix potential overflow

In build_sit_entries(), if valid_blocks in SIT block is smaller than
valid_blocks in journal, for below calculation:

sbi->discard_blks += old_valid_blocks - se->valid_blocks;

There will be two times potential overflow:
- old_valid_blocks - se->valid_blocks will overflow, and be a very
large number.
- sbi->discard_blks += result will overflow again, comes out a correct
result accidently.

Anyway, it should be fixed.
