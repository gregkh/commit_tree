serial: imx: cleanup imx_uart_disable_dma()

Remove unrelated CTSC/CTS disabling from imx_uart_disable_dma() and
move it to imx_uart_shutdown(), which is the only user of the DMA
disabling function. This should not change the driver's behaviour,
but improves readability. After this change imx_uart_disable_dma()
does the reverse thing of imx_uart_enable_dma().
