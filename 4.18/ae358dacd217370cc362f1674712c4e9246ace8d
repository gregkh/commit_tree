drm/udl: Get rid of dev->struct_mutex usage

It's only used to protect our page list, and only when we know we have
a full reference. This means none of these code paths can ever race
with the final unref, and hence we do not need dev->struct_mutex
serialization and can simply switch to our own locking.

For more context the only magic the locked gem_free_object provides is
that it prevents concurrent final unref (and destruction) of gem
objects while anyone is holding dev->struct_mutex. This was used by
i915 (and other drivers) to implement eviction handling with less
headaches.
