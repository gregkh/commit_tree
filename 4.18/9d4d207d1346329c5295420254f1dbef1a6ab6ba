ALSA: timer: Assure timer resolution access always locked

There are still many places calling the timer's hw.c_resolution
callback without lock, and this may lead to some races, as we faced in
the commit a820ccbe21e8 ("ALSA: pcm: Fix UAF at PCM release via PCM
timer access").

This patch changes snd_timer_resolution() to take the timer->lock for
avoiding the races.  A place calling this function already inside the
lock (from the notifier) is replaced with the
snd_timer_hw_resolution() accordingly, as well as wrapping with the
lock around another place calling snd_timer_hw_resolution(), too.
