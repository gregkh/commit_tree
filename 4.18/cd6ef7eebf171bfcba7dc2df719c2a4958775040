powerpc/ptrace: Fix enforcement of DAWR constraints

Back when we first introduced the DAWR, in commit 4ae7ebe9522a
("powerpc: Change hardware breakpoint to allow longer ranges"), we
screwed up the constraint making it a 1024 byte boundary rather than a
512. This makes the check overly permissive. Fortunately GDB is the
only real user and it always did they right thing, so we never
noticed.

This fixes the constraint to 512 bytes.
