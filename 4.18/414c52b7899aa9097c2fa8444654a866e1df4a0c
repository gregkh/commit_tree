pwm: stm32: Fix build warning with CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE disabled

Without dmaengine support, we get a harmless warning about an unused
function:

	drivers/pwm/pwm-stm32.c:166:12: error: 'stm32_pwm_capture' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Changing the #ifdef to an IS_ENABLED() check shuts up that warning and
is slightly nicer to read.
