bnxt_en: Fix the vlan_tci exact match check.

It is possible that OVS may set donâ€™t care for DEI/CFI bit in
vlan_tci mask. Hence, checking for vlan_tci exact match will endup
in a vlan flow rejection.

This patch fixes the problem by checking for vlan_pcp and vid
separately, instead of checking for the entire vlan_tci.

Fixes: e85a9be93cf1 (bnxt_en: do not allow wildcard matches for L2 flows)
