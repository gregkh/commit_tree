powerpc/mm/book3s64/4k: Switch 4k pagesize config to use pagetable fragment

4K config use one full page at level 4 of the pagetable. Add support for single
fragment allocation in pagetable fragment code and and use that for 4K config.
This makes both 4k and 64k use the same code path. Later we will switch pmd to
use the page table fragment code. This is done only for 64bit platforms which
is using page table fragment support.
