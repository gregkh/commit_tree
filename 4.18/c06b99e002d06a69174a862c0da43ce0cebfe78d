staging: most: usb: fix usb_disconnect race condition

The functions usb_disconnect and usb_sndbulkpipe are racing for the struct
usb_device, which might cause a null pointer dereference exception. This
patch fixes this race condition by protecting the critical section inside
the function hdm_enque with the io_mutex.
