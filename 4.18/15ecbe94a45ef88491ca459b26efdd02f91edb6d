tcp: add one more quick ack after after ECN events

Larry Brakmo proposal ( https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/935233/
tcp: force cwnd at least 2 in tcp_cwnd_reduction) made us rethink
about our recent patch removing ~16 quick acks after ECN events.

tcp_enter_quickack_mode(sk, 1) makes sure one immediate ack is sent,
but in the case the sender cwnd was lowered to 1, we do not want
to have a delayed ack for the next packet we will receive.
