net/smc: handle sockopts forcing fallback

Several TCP sockopts do not work for SMC. One example are the
TCP_FASTOPEN sockopts, since SMC-connection setup is based on the TCP
three-way-handshake.
If the SMC socket is still in state SMC_INIT, such sockopts trigger
fallback to TCP. Otherwise an error is returned.
