mtd: cfi_cmdset_0002: fix SEGV unlocking multiple chips

cfi_ppb_unlock() tries to relock all sectors that were locked before
unlocking the whole chip.
This locking used the chip start address + the FULL offset from the
first flash chip, thereby forming an illegal address. Fix that by using
the chip offset(adr).
