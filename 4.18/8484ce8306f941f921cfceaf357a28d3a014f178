bpf: powerpc64: add JIT support for multi-function programs

This adds support for bpf-to-bpf function calls in the powerpc64
JIT compiler. The JIT compiler converts the bpf call instructions
to native branch instructions. After a round of the usual passes,
the start addresses of the JITed images for the callee functions
are known. Finally, to fixup the branch target addresses, we need
to perform an extra pass.

Because of the address range in which JITed images are allocated
on powerpc64, the offsets of the start addresses of these images
from __bpf_call_base are as large as 64 bits. So, for a function
call, we cannot use the imm field of the instruction to determine
the callee's address. Instead, we use the alternative method of
getting it from the list of function addresses in the auxiliary
data of the caller by using the off field as an index.
