usb: typec: tcpm: fix logbuffer index is wrong if _tcpm_log is re-entered

The port->logbuffer_head may be wrong if the two processes enters
_tcpm_log at the mostly same time. The 2nd process enters _tcpm_log
before the 1st process update the index, then the 2nd process will
not allocate logbuffer, when the 2nd process tries to use log buffer,
the index has already updated by the 1st process, so it will get
NULL pointer for updated logbuffer, the error message like below:

	tcpci 0-0050: Log buffer index 6 is NULL
