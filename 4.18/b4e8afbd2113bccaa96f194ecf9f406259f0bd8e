rcutorture: Abbreviate kvm.sh summary lines

With the addition of the end-of-test state, it is not uncommon for the
kvm.sh summary lines to overflow 80 characters.  This commit therefore
applies abbreviations in order to make the line fit into 80 characters
with high probability.

And yes, I did make heavy use of punched cards back in the day, so 80
columns it is for my xterms!  ;-)
