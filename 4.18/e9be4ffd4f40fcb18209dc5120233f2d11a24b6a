ASoC: simple-card: set cpu dai clk in hw_params

The simple-card driver currently accepts a clock node in the cpu dai
sub-node and only uses it as an alternative to the
'system-clock-frequency' property to get the current frequency.

This patch adds another use of the passed clock node. If mclk-fs is
specified, the clocks in cpu and codec dai sub-nodes will be set to
the calculated rate (stream rate * mclk_fs) in hw_params.

This allows platforms to pass tuneable clocks as phandle that will
automatically be set to the right rates.
