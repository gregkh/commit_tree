bpf/xdp: devmap can avoid calling ndo_xdp_flush

The XDP_REDIRECT map devmap can avoid using ndo_xdp_flush, by instead
instructing ndo_xdp_xmit to flush via XDP_XMIT_FLUSH flag in
appropriate places.

Notice after this patch it is possible to remove ndo_xdp_flush
completely, as this is the last user of ndo_xdp_flush. This is left
for later patches, to keep driver changes separate.
