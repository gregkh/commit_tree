ARM: dts: imx1: move clk32 clock into soc dtsi

The clk32 clock is an input clock to CCM module, and should be defined
in soc dtsi rather than a board level dts.  Let's move it into
imx1.dtsi.

While at it, let's drop unnecessary #address-cells/#size-cells from
'clocks' node to DTC warning avoid_unnecessary_addr_size seen with W=1
switch.
