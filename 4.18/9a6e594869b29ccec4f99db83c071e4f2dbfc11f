arm64/sve: Move sve_pffr() to fpsimd.h and make inline

In order to make sve_save_state()/sve_load_state() more easily
reusable and to get rid of a potential branch on context switch
critical paths, this patch makes sve_pffr() inline and moves it to
fpsimd.h.

<asm/processor.h> must be included in fpsimd.h in order to make
this work, and this creates an #include cycle that is tricky to
avoid without modifying core code, due to the way the PR_SVE_*()
prctl helpers are included in the core prctl implementation.

Instead of breaking the cycle, this patch defers inclusion of
<asm/fpsimd.h> in <asm/processor.h> until the point where it is
actually needed: i.e., immediately before the prctl definitions.

No functional change.
