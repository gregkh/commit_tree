mtd: cfi_cmdset_0002: Change erase functions to retry for error

For the word write functions it is retried for error.
But it is not implemented to retry for the erase functions.
To make sure for the erase functions change to retry as same.

This is needed to prevent the flash erase error caused only once.
It was caused by the error case of chip_good() in the do_erase_oneblock().
Also it was confirmed on the MACRONIX flash device MX29GL512FHT2I-11G.
But the error issue behavior is not able to reproduce at this moment.
The flash controller is parallel Flash interface integrated on BCM53003.
