nbd: don't requeue the same request twice.

We can race with the snd timeout and the per-request timeout and end up
requeuing the same request twice.  We can't use the send_complete
completion to tell if everything is ok because we hold the tx_lock
during send, so the timeout stuff will block waiting to mark the socket
dead, and we could be marked complete and still requeue.  Instead add a
flag to the socket so we know whether we've been requeued yet.
