ARM: dts: BCM5301X: Relicense Buffalo files to the GPL 2.0+ / MIT

This matches licensing used by other BCM5301X files and is preferred as:
1) GPL 2.0+ makes is clearly compatible with Linux kernel
2) MIT is also permissive but preferred over ISC

These files were created and ever touched by a group of four people
only: Felix, INAGAKI, Hauke and me.
