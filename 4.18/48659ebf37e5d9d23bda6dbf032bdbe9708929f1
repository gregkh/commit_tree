perf annotate: Record the min/max cycles

Currently perf has a feature to account cycles for LBRs

For example, on skylake:

  perf record -b ...
  perf report or perf annotate

And then browsing the annotate browser gives average cycle counts for
program blocks.

For some analysis it would be useful if we could know not only the
average cycles but also the min and max cycles.

This patch records the min and max cycles.
