lib/vsprintf: Replace space with '_' before crng is ready

Before crng is ready, output of "%p" composes of "(ptrval)" and
left padding spaces for alignment as no random address can be
generated. This seems a little strange when default string width
is larger than strlen("(ptrval)").

For example, when irq domain names are built with "%p", the nodes
under /sys/kernel/debug/irq/domains like this on AArch64 system,

[root@y irq]# ls domains/
default                   irqchip@        (ptrval)-2
irqchip@        (ptrval)-4  \_SB_.TCS0.QIC1  \_SB_.TCS0.QIC3
irqchip@        (ptrval)  irqchip@        (ptrval)-3
\_SB_.TCS0.QIC0             \_SB_.TCS0.QIC2

The name "irqchip@        (ptrval)-2" is not so readable in console
output.

This patch replaces space with readable "_" when output needs padding.
Following is the output after applying the patch,

[root@y domains]# ls
default                   irqchip@(____ptrval____)-2
irqchip@(____ptrval____)-4  \_SB_.TCS0.QIC1  \_SB_.TCS0.QIC3
irqchip@(____ptrval____)  irqchip@(____ptrval____)-3  \_SB_.TCS0.QIC0
\_SB_.TCS0.QIC2

There is same problem in some subsystem's dmesg output. Moreover,
someone may call "%p" in a similar case. In addition, the timing of
crng initialization done may vary on different system. So, the change
is made in vsprintf.c.
