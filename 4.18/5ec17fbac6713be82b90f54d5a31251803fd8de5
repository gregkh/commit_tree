KVM: arm/arm64: Remove kvm_vgic_vcpu_early_init

kvm_vgic_vcpu_early_init gets called after kvm_vgic_cpu_init which
is confusing. The call path is as follows:
kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu
|_ kvm_arch_cpu_create
   |_ kvm_vcpu_init
      |_ kvm_arch_vcpu_init
         |_ kvm_vgic_vcpu_init
|_ kvm_arch_vcpu_postcreate
   |_ kvm_vgic_vcpu_early_init

Static initialization currently done in kvm_vgic_vcpu_early_init()
can be moved to kvm_vgic_vcpu_init(). So let's move the code and
remove kvm_vgic_vcpu_early_init(). kvm_arch_vcpu_postcreate() does
nothing.
