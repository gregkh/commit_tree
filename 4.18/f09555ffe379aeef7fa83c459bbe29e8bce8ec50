net: hns3: Fix for setting mac address when resetting

When hns3_init_mac_addr is called during reset process, it will
get the mac address from NCL_CONFIG and set it to hardware. If
user has changed the mac address, then the mac address set by
user is lost during resetting.

This patch fixes it by not getting the mac address from NCL_CONFIG
when resetting.
