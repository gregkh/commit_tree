scsi: hisi_sas: Mark PHY as in reset for nexus reset

When issuing a nexus reset for directly attached device, we want to ignore
the PHY down events so libsas will not deform and reform the port.

In the case that the attached SAS changes for the reset, libsas will deform
and form a port.

For scenario that the PHY does not come up after a timeout period, then
report the PHY down to libsas.
