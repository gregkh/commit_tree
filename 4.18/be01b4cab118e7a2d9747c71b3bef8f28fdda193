rcu: Inline rcu_preempt_do_callback() into its sole caller

The rcu_preempt_do_callbacks() function was introduced in commit
09223371dea(rcu: Use softirq to address performance regression), where it
was necessary to handle kernel builds both containing and not containing
RCU-preempt.  Since then, various changes (most notably f8b7fc6b51
("rcu: use softirq instead of kthreads except when RCU_BOOST=y")) have
resulted in this function being invoked only from rcu_kthread_do_work(),
which is present only in kernels containing RCU-preempt, which in turn
means that the rcu_preempt_do_callbacks() function is no longer needed.

This commit therefore inlines rcu_preempt_do_callbacks() into its
sole remaining caller and also removes the rcu_state_p and rcu_data_p
indirection for added clarity.
