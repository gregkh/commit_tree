tcp: fix sequence numbers for repaired sockets re-using TIME-WAIT sockets

This patch fixes a bug where the sequence numbers of a socket created using
TCP repair functionality are lower than set after connect is called.
This occurs when the repair socket overlaps with a TIME-WAIT socket and
triggers the re-use code. The amount lower is equal to the number of times
that a particular IP/port set is re-used and then put back into TIME-WAIT.
Re-using the first time the sequence number is 1 lower, closing that socket
and then re-opening (with repair) a new socket with the same addresses/ports
puts the sequence number 2 lower than set via setsockopt. The third time is
3 lower, etc. I have not tested what the limit of this acrewal is, if any.

The fix is, if a socket is in repair mode, to respect the already set
sequence number and timestamp when it would have already re-used the
TIME-WAIT socket.
