iio: adc: stm32-dfsdm: add check on spi-max-frequency

spi-max-frequency is requested for SPI master mode (only), to tune output
clock. It may happen requested frequency isn't reachable.
Add explicit check, so probe fails with error in this case. Otherwise,
output clock may simply be silently turned off (conversions fail).
