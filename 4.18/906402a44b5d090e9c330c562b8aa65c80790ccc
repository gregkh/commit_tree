gpio: of: Handle fixed regulator flags properly

This fixes up the handling of fixed regulator polarity
inversion flags: while I remembered to fix it for the
undocumented "reg-fixed-voltage" I forgot about the
official "regulator-fixed" binding, there are two ways
to do a fixed regulator.

The error was noticed and fixed.
