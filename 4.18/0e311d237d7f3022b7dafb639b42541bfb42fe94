x86/mm: Don't free P4D table when it is folded at runtime

When the P4D page table layer is folded at runtime, the p4d_free()
should do nothing, the same as in <asm-generic/pgtable-nop4d.h>.

It seems this bug should cause double-free in efi_call_phys_epilog(),
but I don't know how to trigger that code path, so I can't confirm that
by testing.
