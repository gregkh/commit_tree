tun: do not compute the rxhash, if not needed

Currently, the tun driver, in absence of an eBPF steering program,
always compute the rxhash in its rx path, even when such value
is later unused due to additional checks (

This changeset moves the all the related checks just before the
__skb_get_hash_symmetric(), so that the latter is no more computed
when unneeded.

Also replace an unneeded RCU section with rcu_access_pointer().
