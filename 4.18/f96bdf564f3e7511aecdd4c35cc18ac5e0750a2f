drm/rect: Handle rounding errors in drm_rect_clip_scaled, v3.

Instead of relying on a scale which may increase rounding errors,
clip src by doing: src * (dst - clip) / dst and rounding the result
away from 1, so the new coordinates get closer to 1. We won't need
to fix up with a magic macro afterwards, because our scaling factor
will never go to the other side of 1.

Changes since v1:
- Adjust dst immediately, else drm_rect_width/height on dst gives bogus
  results.
Change since v2:
- Get rid of macros and use 64-bits math.
