Input: elantech - add support for SMBus devices

Many of the Elantech devices are connected through PS/2 and a different
bus (SMBus or plain I2C).

To not break any existing device, we only enable SMBus based
on a module parameter. If some laptops require the quirk to
be set, we will have to rely on a list of PNPIds or MDI matching
to individually expose those hardware over SMBus.
the parameter mentioned above is elantech_smbus from the psmouse
module.
