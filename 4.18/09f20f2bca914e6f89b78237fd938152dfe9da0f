media: intel-ipu3: cio2: Handle IRQs until INT_STS is cleared

Interrupt behavior shows that some time the frame end and frame start of
next frame is unstable and can range from several to hundreds of
micro-sec. In the case of ~10us, isr may not clear next sof interrupt
status in single handling, which prevents new interrupts from coming.

Fix this by handling all pending IRQs before exiting isr, so any abnormal
behavior results from very short interrupt status changes is protected.
