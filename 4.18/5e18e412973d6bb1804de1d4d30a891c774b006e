clocksource: arm_arch_timer: Set arch_mem_timer cpumask to cpu_possible_mask

Currently, arch_mem_timer cpumask is set to cpu_all_mask which should be
fine. However, cpu_possible_mask is more accurate and if there are other
clockevent source in the system which are set to cpu_possible_mask, then
having cpu_all_mask may result in issue.

E.g. on a platform with arm,sp804 timer with rating 300 and
cpu_possible_mask and this arch_mem_timer timer with rating 400 and
cpu_all_mask, tick_check_preferred may choose both preferred as the
cpumasks are not equal though they must be.

This issue was root caused incorrectly initially and a fix was merged as
commit 1332a9055801 ("tick: Prefer a lower rating device only if it's CPU
local device").
