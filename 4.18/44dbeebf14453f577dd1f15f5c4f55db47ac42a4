clk: qcom: gdsc: Add support to reset AON and block reset logic

For some of the gdsc power domains, there could be need to reset the
AON logic or assert/deassert the block control reset before removing
the clamp_io. Add support for the same by introducing new flags
SW_RESET and AON_RESET. Both SW reset and AON reset requires to be
asserted for at least 1us before being de-asserted.
