powerpc/eeh: Introduce eeh_set_irq_state()

To ease future refactoring, extract calls to eeh_enable_irq() and
eeh_disable_irq() from the various report functions. This makes
the report functions initial sequences more similar, as well as making
the IRQ changes visible when reading eeh_handle_normal_event().
