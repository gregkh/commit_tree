KVM/Eventfd: Avoid crash when assign and deassign specific eventfd in parallel.

Syzbot reports crashes in kvm_irqfd_assign(), caused by use-after-free
when kvm_irqfd_assign() and kvm_irqfd_deassign() run in parallel
for one specific eventfd. When the assign path hasn't finished but irqfd
has been added to kvm->irqfds.items list, another thead may deassign the
eventfd and free struct kvm_kernel_irqfd(). The assign path then uses
the struct kvm_kernel_irqfd that has been freed by deassign path. To avoid
such issue, keep irqfd under kvm->irq_srcu protection after the irqfd
has been added to kvm->irqfds.items list, and call synchronize_srcu()
in irq_shutdown() to make sure that irqfd has been fully initialized in
the assign path.
