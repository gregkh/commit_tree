soc: imx: gpcv2: Do not pass static memory as platform data

Platform device core assumes the ownership of dev.platform_data as
well as that it is dynamically allocated and it will try to kfree it
as a part of platform_device_release(). Change the code to use
platform_device_add_data() n instead of a pointer to a static memory
to avoid causing a BUG() when calling platform_device_put().

The problem can be reproduced by artificially enabling the error path
of platform_device_add() call (around line 357).

Note that this change also allows us to constify imx7_pgc_domains,
since we no longer need to be able to modify it.
