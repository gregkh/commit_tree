bpf: add bpf_skb_cgroup_id helper

Add a new bpf_skb_cgroup_id() helper that allows to retrieve the
cgroup id from the skb's socket. This is useful in particular to
enable bpf_get_cgroup_classid()-like behavior for cgroup v1 in
cgroup v2 by allowing ID based matching on egress. This can in
particular be used in combination with applying policy e.g. from
map lookups, and also complements the older bpf_skb_under_cgroup()
interface. In user space the cgroup id for a given path can be
retrieved through the f_handle as demonstrated in [0] recently.
