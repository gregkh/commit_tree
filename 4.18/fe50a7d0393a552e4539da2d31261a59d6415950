ipmi:bt: Set the timeout before doing a capabilities check

There was one place where the timeout value for an operation was
not being set, if a capabilities request was done from idle.  Move
the timeout value setting to before where that change might be
requested.

IMHO the cause here is the invisible returns in the macros.  Maybe
that's a job for later, though.
