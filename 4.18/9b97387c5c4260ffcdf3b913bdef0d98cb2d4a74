cacheinfo: rename of_node to fw_token

Rename and change the type of of_node to indicate
it is a generic pointer which is generally only used
for comparison purposes. In a later patch we will put
an ACPI/PPTT token pointer in fw_token so that
the code which builds the shared cpu masks can be reused.
