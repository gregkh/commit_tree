btrfs: qgroup: Allow trace_btrfs_qgroup_account_extent() to record its transid

When debugging quota rescan race, some times btrfs rescan could account
some old (committed) leaf and then re-account newly committed leaf
in next generation.

This race needs extra transid to locate, so add @transid for
trace_btrfs_qgroup_account_extent() for such debug.
