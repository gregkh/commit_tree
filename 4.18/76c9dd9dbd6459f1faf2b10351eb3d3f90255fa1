clk: davinci: pll: allow dev == NULL

This modifies the TI Davinci PLL clock driver to allow for the case
when dev == NULL. On some (most) SoCs that use this driver, the PLL
clock needs to be registered during early boot because it is used
for clocksource/clkevent and there will be no platform device available.
