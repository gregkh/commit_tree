pinctrl: samsung: Fix suspend/resume for Exynos5433 GPF1..5 banks

GPF1..5 banks in Exynos5433 are located in two pinctrl devices: ALIVE and
IMEM. Although they are partially located in ALIVE section, the state of
their registers in IMEM section is lost after suspend/resume cycle. To
properly handle such case, those banks have to be defined with standard
'exynos5433_bank_type_off' type (with PINCFG_TYPE_CON_PDN and
PINCFG_TYPE_PUD_PDN register offsets). This automatically instructs
the generic Samsung pinctrl suspend/resume code to save and restore state
of those registers.
