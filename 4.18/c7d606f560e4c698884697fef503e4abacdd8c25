x86/mce: Improve error message when kernel cannot recover

Since we added support to add recovery from some errors inside the kernel in:

commit b2f9d678e28c ("x86/mce: Check for faults tagged in EXTABLE_CLASS_FAULT exception table entries")

we have done a less than stellar job at reporting the cause of recoverable
machine checks that occur in other parts of the kernel. The user just gets
the unhelpful message:

	mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Action required: unknown MCACOD

doubly unhelpful when they check the manual for the reported IA32_MSR_STATUS.MCACOD
and see that it is listed as one of the standard recoverable values.

Add an extra rule to the MCE severity table to catch this case and report it
as:

	mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel

Fixes: b2f9d678e28c ("x86/mce: Check for faults tagged in EXTABLE_CLASS_FAULT exception table entries")
