rcu: Inline rcu_start_gp_advanced() into rcu_start_future_gp()

The rcu_start_gp_advanced() is invoked only from rcu_start_future_gp() and
much of its code is redundant when invoked from that context.  This commit
therefore inlines rcu_start_gp_advanced() into rcu_start_future_gp(),
then removes rcu_start_gp_advanced().
