drm/i915/execlists: Emit i915_trace_request_out for preemption

Move the tracepoint into the common execlists_context_schedule_out() and
call it from preemption completion as well. A small bit of refactoring
code should help with when tracing, or else we end up with requests
mysteriously disappearing and some being emitted to HW multiple times.
