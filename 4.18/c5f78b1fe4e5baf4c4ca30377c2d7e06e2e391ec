serial: Introduce UPSTAT_SYNC_FIFO for synchronised FIFOs

This change adds a flag to indicate that a UART is has an external means
of synchronising its FIFO, without needing CTSRTS or XON/XOFF.

This allows us to use the throttle/unthrottle callbacks, without having
to claim other methods of flow control.
