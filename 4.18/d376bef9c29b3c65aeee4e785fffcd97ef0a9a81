netfilter: x_tables: set module owner for icmp(6) matches

nft_compat relies on xt_request_find_match to increment
refcount of the module that provides the match/target.

The (builtin) icmp matches did't set the module owner so it
was possible to rmmod ip(6)tables while icmp extensions were still in use.
