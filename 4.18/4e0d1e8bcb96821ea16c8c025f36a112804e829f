perf symbols: Split kernel symbol processing from dso__load_sym()

More should be done to split this function, removing stuff map
relocation steps from the actual symbol table loading.

Arch specific stuff also should go elsewhere, to tools/arch/ and
we should have it keyed by data from the perf_env either in the
perf.data header or from the running environment.
