sctp: re-use sctp_transport_pmtu in sctp_transport_route

sctp_transport_route currently is very similar to sctp_transport_pmtu plus
a few other bits.

This patch reuses sctp_transport_pmtu in sctp_transport_route and removes
the duplicated code.

Also, as all calls to sctp_transport_route were forcing the dst release
before calling it, let's just include such release too.
