xhci: change xhci_test_and_clear_bit() to use new port structure

Don't use pointers to port array and port index as function parameters
in xhci_test_and_clear_bit(), just use a pointer to the right port
structure.

xhci_test_and_clear_bit() was the last port_array user in
xhci_get_port_status() and handle_port_status(), so remove the
port_array from them as well.
