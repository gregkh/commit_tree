drm/i915/debugfs: Print sink PSR status

IGT tests could be improved with sink status, knowing for sure that
hardware have activate or exit PSR.

Reading i915_edp_psr_status was causing PSR to exit but now with
'drm/i915/psr: Prevent PSR exit when a non-pipe related register is
written' it is fixed.
