serial: uartps: Remove console_initcall from the driver

register_console() is called from
uart_add_one_port()->uart_configure_port()
that's why register_console() is called twice.

This patch remove console_initcall to call register_console() only from
one location.

Also based on my tests cdns_uart_console_setup() is not called
from the first register_console() call.
