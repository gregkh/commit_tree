ath10k: enable SRRI/DRRI support on ddr for WCN3990

SRRI/DRRI are not mapped in the HW Shadow block and can lead
to un-clocked access if common subsystem in the target is
powered down due to idle mode.

To mitigate this problem SRRI/DRRI can be read from
DDR instead of doing an actual hardware read.
Host allocates non cached memory on ddr and configures
the physical address of this memory to the CE hardware.
The hardware updates the RRI on this particular location.
Read SRRI/DRRI from DDR location instead of
direct target read.

Enable retention restore on ddr using hw params to enable
in specific targets.
