staging: ks7010: Remove trailing _t from 'struct association_request_t'.

The "_t" suffix is not needed for structure names in this driver, and is a
reflection of an older typedef system that is no longer in place. Replace
all occurences of 'struct association_request_t' with 'struct
association_request'.
