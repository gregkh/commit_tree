powerpc/watchdog: provide more data in watchdog messages

Provide timebase and timebase of last heartbeat in watchdog lockup
messages. Also provide a stack trace of when a CPU becomes un-stuck,
which can be useful -- it could be where irqs are re-enabled, so it
may be the end of the critical section which is responsible for the
latency which is useful information.
