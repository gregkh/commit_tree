batman-adv: Fix debugfs path for renamed softif

batman-adv is creating special debugfs directories in the init
net_namespace for each created soft-interface (batadv net_device). But it
is possible to rename a net_device to a completely different name then the
original one.

It can therefore happen that a user registers a new batadv net_device with
the name "bat0". batman-adv is then also adding a new directory under
$debugfs/batman-adv/ with the name "wlan0".

The user then decides to rename this device to "bat1" and registers a
different batadv device with the name "bat0". batman-adv will then try to
create a directory with the name "bat0" under $debugfs/batman-adv/ again.
But there already exists one with this name under this path and thus this
fails. batman-adv will detect a problem and rollback the registering of
this device.

batman-adv must therefore take care of renaming the debugfs directories for
soft-interfaces whenever it detects such a net_device rename.
