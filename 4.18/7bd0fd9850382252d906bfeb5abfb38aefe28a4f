drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Properly disable aux chan retries on rockchip

The comments in analogix_dp_init_aux() claim that we're disabling aux
channel retries, but then right below it for Rockchip it sets them to
3.  If we actually need 3 retries for Rockchip then we could adjust
the comment, but it seems more likely that we want the same retry
behavior across all platforms.
