loop: add recursion validation to LOOP_CHANGE_FD

Refactor the validation code used in LOOP_SET_FD so it is also used in
LOOP_CHANGE_FD.  Otherwise it is possible to construct a set of loop
devices that all refer to each other.  This can lead to a infinite
loop in starting with "while (is_loop_device(f)) .." in loop_set_fd().

Fix this by refactoring out the validation code and using it for
LOOP_CHANGE_FD as well as LOOP_SET_FD.
