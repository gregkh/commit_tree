cpufreq: tegra20: Remove EMC clock usage

The EMC driver has been gone 4 years ago, since the commit a7cbe92cef27
("ARM: tegra: remove tegra EMC scaling driver"). Remove the EMC clock
usage as it does nothing. We may consider re-implementing the EMC scaling
later, probably using PM Memory Bandwidth QoS API.
