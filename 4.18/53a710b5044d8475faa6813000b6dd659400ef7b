sh_eth: fix invalid context bug while calling auto-negotiation by ethtool

Since commit 35b5f6b1a82b ("PHYLIB: Locking fixes for PHY I/O
potentially sleeping") phy_start_aneg() function utilizes a mutex
to serialize changes to phy state, however the helper function is
called in atomic context.

The bug can be reproduced by running "ethtool -r" command, the bug
is reported if CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP build option is enabled.
