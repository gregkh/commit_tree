nvme-pci: move ->cq_vector == -1 check outside of ->q_lock

We only clear it dynamically in nvme_suspend_queue(). When we do, ensure
to do a full flush so that any nvme_queue_rq() invocation will see it.

Ideally we'd kill this check completely, but we're using it to flush
requests on a dying queue.
