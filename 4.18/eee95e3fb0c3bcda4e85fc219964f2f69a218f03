btrfs: add sanity check when resuming balance after mount

Replace a WARN_ON with a proper check and message in case something goes
really wrong and resumed balance cannot set up its exclusive status.
The check is a user friendly assertion, I don't expect to ever happen
under normal circumstances.

Also document that the paused balance starts here and owns the exclusive
op status.
