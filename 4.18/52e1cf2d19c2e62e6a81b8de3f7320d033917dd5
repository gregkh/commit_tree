efi/libstub/tpm: Initialize efi_physical_addr_t vars to zero for mixed mode

Commit:

  79832f0b5f71 ("efi/libstub/tpm: Initialize pointer variables to zero for mixed mode")

fixes a problem with the tpm code on mixed mode (64-bit kernel on 32-bit UEFI),
where 64-bit pointer variables are not fully initialized by the 32-bit EFI code.

A similar problem applies to the efi_physical_addr_t variables which
are written by the ->get_event_log() EFI call. Even though efi_physical_addr_t
is 64-bit everywhere, it seems that some 32-bit UEFI implementations only
fill in the lower 32 bits when passed a pointer to an efi_physical_addr_t
to fill.

This commit initializes these to 0 to, to ensure the upper 32 bits are
0 in mixed mode. This fixes recent kernels sometimes hanging during
early boot on mixed mode UEFI systems.
