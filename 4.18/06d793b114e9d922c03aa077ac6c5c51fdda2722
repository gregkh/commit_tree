ARM: dts: imx51-zii-rdu1: fix touchscreen pinctrl

The pinctrl settings were incorrect for the touchscreen interrupt line, causing
an interrupt storm. This change has been tested with both the atmel_mxt_ts and
RMI4 drivers on the RDU1 units.

The value 0x4 comes from the value of register IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_CSI1_D8
from the old vendor kernel.
