KVM: x86: pass kvm_vcpu to kvm_read_guest_virt and kvm_write_guest_virt_system

Int the next patch the emulator's .read_std and .write_std callbacks will
grow another argument, which is not needed in kvm_read_guest_virt and
kvm_write_guest_virt_system's callers.  Since we have to make separate
functions, let's give the currently existing names a nicer interface, too.
