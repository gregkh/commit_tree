KVM: Enforce error in ioctl for compat tasks when !KVM_COMPAT

The current behaviour of the compat ioctls is a bit odd.
We provide a compat_ioctl method when KVM_COMPAT is set, and NULL
otherwise. But NULL means that the normal, non-compat ioctl should
be used directly for compat tasks, and there is no way to actually
prevent a compat task from issueing KVM ioctls.

This patch changes this behaviour, by always registering a compat_ioctl
method, even if KVM_COMPAT is not selected. In that case, the callback
will always return -EINVAL.
