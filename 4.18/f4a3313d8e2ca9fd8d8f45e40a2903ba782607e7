tcp: avoid collapses in tcp_prune_queue() if possible

Right after a TCP flow is created, receiving tiny out of order
packets allways hit the condition :

if (atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc) >= sk->sk_rcvbuf)
	tcp_clamp_window(sk);

tcp_clamp_window() increases sk_rcvbuf to match sk_rmem_alloc
(guarded by tcp_rmem[2])

Calling tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() in this case is not useful,
and offers a O(N^2) surface attack to malicious peers.

Better not attempt anything before full queue capacity is reached,
forcing attacker to spend lots of resource and allow us to more
easily detect the abuse.
