fuse: fix control dir setup and teardown

syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference at fuse_ctl_remove_conn() [1].
Since fc->ctl_ndents is incremented by fuse_ctl_add_conn() when new_inode()
failed, fuse_ctl_remove_conn() reaches an inode-less dentry and tries to
clear d_inode(dentry)->i_private field.

Fix by only adding the dentry to the array after being fully set up.

When tearing down the control directory, do d_invalidate() on it to get rid
of any mounts that might have been added.
