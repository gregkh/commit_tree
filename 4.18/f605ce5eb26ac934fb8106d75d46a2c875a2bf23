bpf, s390: fix potential memleak when later bpf_jit_prog fails

If we would ever fail in the bpf_jit_prog() pass that writes the
actual insns to the image after we got header via bpf_jit_binary_alloc()
then we also need to make sure to free it through bpf_jit_binary_free()
again when bailing out. Given we had prior bpf_jit_prog() passes to
initially probe for clobbered registers, program size and to fill in
addrs arrray for jump targets, this is more of a theoretical one,
but at least make sure this doesn't break with future changes.
