media: ngene: cleanup superfluous I2C adapter evaluation

Commit ee93340e98bc ("media: ngene: deduplicate I2C adapter evaluation")
added a helper to evaluate the I2C adapter to be used for demod/tuner
attachment based on the given ngene_channel, and that helper is used in
many attach functions to initialise the i2c_adapter variable. However,
for some reason in tuner_attach_stv6110() and demod_attach_stv0900(), the
adapter evaluation wasn't removed as in all other functions. Fix (or
finalize, even) the helper use by cleaning up the superfluous I2C adapter
evaluation leftover in these two functions.
