locking/rwsem: Fix up_read_non_owner() warning with DEBUG_RWSEMS

It was found that the use of up_read_non_owner() in NFS was causing
the following warning when DEBUG_RWSEMS was configured.

  DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(sem->owner != ((struct task_struct *)(1UL << 0)))

Looking into the rwsem.c file, it was discovered that the corresponding
down_read_non_owner() function was not setting the owner field properly.
This is fixed now, and the warning should be gone.
