thermal: qcom-spmi-temp-alarm: add support for GEN2 PMIC peripherals

Add support for the TEMP_ALARM GEN2 PMIC peripheral subtype.  The
GEN2 subtype defines an over temperature state with hysteresis
instead of stage in the status register.  There are two GEN2
states corresponding to stages 1 and 2.
