scsi: cxlflash: Adapter context support for OCXL

Add support to create and release the adapter contexts for OCXL and provide
means to specify certain contexts as a master.

The existing cxlflash core has a design requirement that each host will have a
single host context available by default. To satisfy this requirement, one
host adapter context is created when the hardware AFU is initialized. This is
returned by the get_context() fop.
