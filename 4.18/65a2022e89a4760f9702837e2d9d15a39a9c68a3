net/ipv6: Add fib lookup stubs for use in bpf helper

Add stubs to retrieve a handle to an IPv6 FIB table, fib6_get_table,
a stub to do a lookup in a specific table, fib6_table_lookup, and
a stub for a full route lookup.

The stubs are needed for core bpf code to handle the case when the
IPv6 module is not builtin.
