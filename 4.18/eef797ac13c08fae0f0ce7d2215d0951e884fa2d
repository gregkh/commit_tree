mmc: sunxi: Drop the init / reset of the controller from set_ios

Our set_ios hook is, when the card is power up or down, either doing a full
init or put our controller back into a reset mode.

Since we're also doing that in our runtime_pm hooks, and at possibly much
more often, we can drop it from the set_ios, and either rely on our
runtime_pm hooks or our probe to do it.
