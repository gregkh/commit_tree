ALSA: hda/ca0132: fix array_size.cocci warnings

sound/pci/hda/patch_ca0132.c:5062:50-51: WARNING: Use ARRAY_SIZE
sound/pci/hda/patch_ca0132.c:5092:50-51: WARNING: Use ARRAY_SIZE

 Use ARRAY_SIZE instead of dividing sizeof array with sizeof an element

Semantic patch information:
 This makes an effort to find cases where ARRAY_SIZE can be used such as
 where there is a division of sizeof the array by the sizeof its first
 element or by any indexed element or the element type. It replaces the
 division of the two sizeofs by ARRAY_SIZE.
