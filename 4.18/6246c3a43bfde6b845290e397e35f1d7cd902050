media: vpbe_venc: potential uninitialized variable in ven_sub_dev_init()

Smatch complains that "venc" could be uninitialized.  There are a couple
of error paths where it looks like maybe that could happen.  I don't know
if it's really a bug, but it's reasonable to set "venc" to NULL and
silence the warning.
