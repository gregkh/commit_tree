remoteproc: Prevent incorrect rproc state on xfer mem ownership failure

Any failure in the secure call for transferring mem ownership of mba
region to Q6 would result in reporting that the remoteproc device
is running. This is because the previous q6v5_clk_enable would have
been a success. Prevent this by updating variable 'ret' accordingly.
