bpf: btf: Clean up BTF_INT_BITS() in uapi btf.h

This patch shrinks the BTF_INT_BITS() mask.  The current
btf_int_check_meta() ensures the nr_bits of an integer
cannot exceed 64.  Hence, it is mostly an uapi cleanup.

The actual btf usage (i.e. seq_show()) is also modified
to use u8 instead of u16.  The verification (e.g. btf_int_check_meta())
path stays as is to deal with invalid BTF situation.
