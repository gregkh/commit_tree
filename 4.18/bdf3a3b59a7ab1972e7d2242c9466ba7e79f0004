spi: Check presence the of ->transfer[_xxx]() before registering a controller

Right now, no checks are done on the presence of a ->transfer[_xxx]()
method, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when someone
starts sending something on the bus.

Do the check at registration time and refuse to add the controller if
all ->transfer[_xxx]() pointers are NULL.
