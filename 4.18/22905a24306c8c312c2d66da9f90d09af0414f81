ARM: 8766/1: drop no-thumb-interwork in EABI mode

According to GCC documentation -m(no-)thumb-interwork is
meaningless in AAPCS configurations. Also clang does not
support the flag:
  clang-5.0: error: unknown argument: '-mno-thumb-interwork'

Just drop -mno-thumb-interwork in AEABI configuration.
