phy: tegra: select USB_COMMON

A built-in PHY driver cannot link against modular USB core code:

drivers/usb/phy/phy-tegra-usb.o: In function `tegra_usb_phy_probe':
phy-tegra-usb.c:(.text+0x6bc): undefined reference to `usb_get_dr_mode'

This uses a 'select' statement in Kconfig like we have for other such
PHY drivers.
