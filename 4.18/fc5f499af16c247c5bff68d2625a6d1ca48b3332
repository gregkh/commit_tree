staging: lustre: llite: use more private data in dump_pgcache

The dump_page_cache debugfs file allocates and frees an 'env' in each
call to vvp_pgcache_start,next,show.  This is likely to be fast, but
does introduce the need to check for errors.

It is reasonable to allocate a single 'env' when the file is opened,
and use that throughout.

So create 'seq_private' structure which stores the sbi, env, and
refcheck, and attach this to the seqfile.

Then use it throughout instead of allocating 'env' repeatedly.
