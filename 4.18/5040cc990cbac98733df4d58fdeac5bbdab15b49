net: dsa: b53: Fix for brcm tag issue in Cygnus SoC

In the Broadcom Cygnus SoC, the brcm tag needs to be inserted
in between the mac address and the ether type (should use
'DSA_PROTO_TAG_BRCM') for the packets sent to the internal
b53 switch.

Since the Cygnus was added with the BCM58XX device id and the
BCM58XX uses 'DSA_PROTO_TAG_BRCM_PREPEND', the data path is
broken, due to the incorrect brcm tag location.

Add a new b53 device id (BCM583XX) for Cygnus family to fix the
issue. Add the new device id to the BCM58XX family as Cygnus
is similar to the BCM58XX in most other functionalities.
