clk: meson: meson8b: mark fclk_div2 gate clocks as CLK_IS_CRITICAL

Until commit 05f814402d6174 ("clk: meson: add fdiv clock gates") we
relied on the bootloader to enable the fclk_div clock gates. It turns
out that our clock tree is incomplete at least on Meson8b (tested with
an Odroid-C1, which uses an RGMII PHY) because after the mentioned
commit Ethernet is not working anymore (no RX/TX activity can be seen).
At the same time Ethernet was still working on Meson8m2 with a RMII PHY.

Testing has shown that as soon as "fclk_div2" is disabled Ethernet stops
working on Odroid-C1. Unfortunately it's currently not clear what the
Ethernet controller IP block uses the fclk_div2 clock for. Mark the
clock as CLK_IS_CRITICAL to keep it enabled (as it's already enabled by
most bootloaders by default, which is why we didn't notice it before).
