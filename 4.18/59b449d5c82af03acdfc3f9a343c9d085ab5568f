drm/i915: Split out functions for different kinds of workarounds

There are different kind of workarounds (those that modify registers that
live in the context image, those that modify global registers, those that
whitelist registers, etc...) and they have different requirements in terms
of where they are applied and how. Also, by splitting them apart, it should
be easier to decide where a new workaround should go.

v2:
  - Add multiple MISSING_CASE
  - Rebased

v3:
  - Rename mmio_workarounds to gt_workarounds (Chris, Mika)
  - Create empty placeholders for BDW and CHV GT WAs
  - Rebased

v4: Rebased

v5:
 - Rebased
 - FORCE_TO_NONPRIV register exists since BDW, so make a path
   for it to achieve universality, even if empty (Chris)
