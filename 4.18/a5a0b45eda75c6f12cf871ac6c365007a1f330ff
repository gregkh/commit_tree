misc: cxl: Change return type to vm_fault_t

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler. For
now, this is just documenting that the function returns
a VM_FAULT value rather than an errno. Once all instances
are converted, vm_fault_t will become a distinct type.

Reference id -> 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to
vm_fault_t")

previously cxl_mmap_fault returns VM_FAULT_NOPAGE as
default value irrespective of vm_insert_pfn() return
value. This bug is fixed with new vmf_insert_pfn()
which will return VM_FAULT_ type based on err.
