IB: Fix RDMA_RXE and INFINIBAND_RDMAVT dependencies for DMA_VIRT_OPS

DMA_VIRT_OPS requires that dma_addr_t is at least as wide as a
pointer, which is expressed as a dependency on !64BIT ||
ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT.

For parisc64 this is not true, and if these IB modules are enabled,
kconfig warns:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for DMA_VIRT_OPS
  Depends on [n]: HAS_DMA [=y] && (!64BIT [=y] || ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT)
  Selected by [m]:
  - INFINIBAND_RDMAVT [=m] && INFINIBAND [=m] && 64BIT [=y] && PCI [=y]
  - RDMA_RXE [=m] && INET [=y] && PCI [=y] && INFINIBAND [=m]

Add dependencies to fix this.
