gfs2: Remove sdp->sd_jheightsize

GFS2 keeps two arrarys in the superblock that define the maximum size of
an inode depending on the inode's height: sdp->sd_heightsize defines the
heights in units of sb->s_blocksize; sdp->sd_jheightsize defines them in
units of sb->s_blocksize - sizeof(struct gfs2_meta_header).  These
arrays are used to determine when additional layers of indirect blocks
are needed.  The second array is used for directories which have an
additional gfs2_meta_header at the beginning of each block.

Distinguishing between these two cases makes no sense: the height
required for representing N blocks will come out the same no matter if
the calculation is done in gross (sb->s_blocksize) or net
(sb->s_blocksize - sizeof(struct gfs2_meta_header)) units.

Stuffed directories don't have an additional gfs2_meta_header, but the
stuffed case is handled separately for both files and directories,
anyway.

Remove the unncessary sdp->sd_jheightsize array.
