mmc: sdhci-omap: Workaround for Errata i843

Errata i843 in AM572x Sitara Processors Silicon Revision 2.0, 1.1
(SPRZ429K July 2014â€“Revised March 2017 [1]) mentions
PG 1.0/1.1 silicon has limitations w.r.t frequencies at which MMC1/2/3
can operate.

Use soc_device_match() to identify rev 1.0/1.1 silicon and
override mmc->f_max according to the errata workaround.
"max-frequency" dt property cannot be used since the device
tree is added for rev 2.0 silicon.

soc_device_match() is also used in order to get the IODelay values
for rev 1.0/1.1 silicon.
