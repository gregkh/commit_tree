fm10k: don't protect fm10k_queue_mac_request by fm10k_host_mbx_ready

We don't actually need to check if the host mbx is ready when queuing
MAC requests, because these are not handled by a special queue which
queues up requests until the mailbox is capable of handling them.

Pull these requests outside the fm10k_host_mbx_ready() check, as it is
not necessary.
