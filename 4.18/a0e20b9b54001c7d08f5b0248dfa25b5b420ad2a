crypto: testmgr - add extra ecb(tnepres) encryption test vectors

None of the four "ecb(tnepres)" decryption test vectors exactly match an
encryption test vector with input and result swapped.  In preparation
for removing the decryption test vectors, add these to the encryption
test vectors, so we don't lose any test coverage.
