arm64: dts: qcom: rename qcom,pcie devices to pcie

The node name for a PCIe host bridge must be "pcie" as required by
the binging. dtc now warns about it:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/apq8096-db820c.dtb: Warning (pci_bridge): /soc/agnoc@0/qcom,pcie@610000: node name is not "pci" or "pcie"
arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/apq8096-db820c.dtb: Warning (pci_device_bus_num): Failed prerequisite 'pci_bridge'
arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8996-mtp.dtb: Warning (pci_bridge): /soc/agnoc@0/qcom,pcie@610000: node name is not "pci" or "pcie"
arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8996-mtp.dtb: Warning (pci_device_bus_num): Failed prerequisite 'pci_bridge'

This renames the nodes as appropriate.
