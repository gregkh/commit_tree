media: adv7511: fix incorrect clear of CEC receive interrupt

If a CEC message was received and the RX interrupt was set, but
not yet processed, and a new transmit was issues, then the
transmit code would inadvertently clear the RX interrupt and
after that no new messages would ever be received.

Instead it should only clear TX interrupts since register 0x97
is a clear-on-write register.
