cfg80211: fix rcu in cfg80211_unregister_wdev

Callers of cfg80211_unregister_wdev can free the wdev object
immediately after this function returns. This may crash the kernel
because this wdev object is still in use by other threads.
Add synchronize_rcu() after list_del_rcu to make sure wdev object can
be safely freed.
