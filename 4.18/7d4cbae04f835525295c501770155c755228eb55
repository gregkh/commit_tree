selftests: forwarding: Add libs for gretap mirror testing

To simplify implementation of mirror-to-gretap tests, extend lib.sh with
several new functions that might potentially be useful more
broadly (although right now the mirroring tests will be the only
client).

Also add mirror_lib.sh with code useful for mirroring tests,
mirror_gre_lib.sh with code specifically useful for mirror-to-gretap
tests, and mirror_gre_topo.sh that primes a given test with a good
baseline topology that the test can then tweak to its liking.
