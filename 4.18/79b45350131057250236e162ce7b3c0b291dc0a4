tools/bpf: add a test for bpf_get_stack with tracepoint prog

The test_stacktrace_map and test_stacktrace_build_id are
enhanced to call bpf_get_stack in the helper to get the
stack trace as well.  The stack traces from bpf_get_stack
and bpf_get_stackid are compared to ensure that for the
same stack as represented as the same hash, their ip addresses
or build id's must be the same.
