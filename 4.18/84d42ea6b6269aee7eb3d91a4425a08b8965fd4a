xfs: implement the metadata repair ioctl flag

Plumb in the pieces necessary to make the "scrub" subfunction of
the scrub ioctl actually work.  This means that we make the IFLAG_REPAIR
flag to the scrub ioctl actually do something, and we add an errortag
knob so that xfstests can force the kernel to rebuild a metadata
structure even if there's nothing wrong with it.
