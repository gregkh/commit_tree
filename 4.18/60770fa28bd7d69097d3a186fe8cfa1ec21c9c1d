drm/nouveau/gr/gf100-: virtualise dist_skip_table + improve algorithm

The algorithm for GM200 and newer matches RM for all the boards I have, but
I don't have enough data to try and figure something out for earlier boards,
so these will still write zeroes to the table as we did before.

The code in NVGPU isn't helpful here, it appears to handle specific cases.
