kvm: Make VM ioctl do valloc for some archs

The kvm struct has been bloating. For example, it's tens of kilo-bytes
for x86, which turns out to be a large amount of memory to allocate
contiguously via kzalloc. Thus, this patch does the following:
1. Uses architecture-specific routines to allocate the kvm struct via
   vzalloc for x86.
2. Switches arm to __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_VM_ALLOC so that it can use vzalloc
   when has_vhe() is true.

Other architectures continue to default to kalloc, as they have a
dependency on kalloc or have a small-enough struct kvm.
