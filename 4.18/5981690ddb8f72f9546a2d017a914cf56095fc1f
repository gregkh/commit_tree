memremap: split devm_memremap_pages() and memremap() infrastructure

Currently, kernel/memremap.c contains generic code for supporting
memremap() (CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM) and devm_memremap_pages()
(CONFIG_ZONE_DEVICE). This causes ongoing build maintenance problems as
additions to memremap.c, especially for the ZONE_DEVICE case, need to be
careful about being placed in ifdef guards. Remove the need for these
ifdef guards by moving the ZONE_DEVICE support functions to their own
compilation unit.
