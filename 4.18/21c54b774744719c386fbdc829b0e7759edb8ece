kconfig: show compiler version text in the top comment

The kernel configuration phase is now tightly coupled with the compiler
in use.  It will be nice to show the compiler information in Kconfig.

The compiler information will be displayed like this:

  $ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- config
  scripts/kconfig/conf  --oldaskconfig Kconfig
  *
  * Linux/arm64 4.16.0-rc1 Kernel Configuration
  *
  *
  * Compiler: aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc (Linaro GCC 7.2-2017.11) 7.2.1 20171011
  *
  *
  * General setup
  *
  Compile also drivers which will not load (COMPILE_TEST) [N/y/?]

If you use GUI methods such as menuconfig, it will be displayed in the
top menu.

This is simply implemented by using the 'comment' statement.  So, it
will be saved into the .config file as well.

This commit has a very important meaning.  If the compiler is upgraded,
Kconfig must be re-run since different compilers have different sets
of supported options.

All referenced environments are written to include/config/auto.conf.cmd
so that any environment change triggers syncconfig, and prompt the user
to input new values if needed.

With this commit, something like follows will be added to
include/config/auto.conf.cmd

  ifneq "$(CC_VERSION_TEXT)" "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc (Linaro GCC 7.2-2017.11) 7.2.1 20171011"
  include/config/auto.conf: FORCE
  endif
