net: phy: Fix modular PHYLIB build

After commit c59530d0d5dc ("net: Move PHY statistics code into PHY
library helpers") we made net/core/ethtool.c reference symbols which are
part of the library which can be modular. David introduced a temporary
fix with 1ecd6e8ad996 ("phy: Temporary build fix after phylib changes.")
which would prevent such modularity.

This is not desireable of course, so instead, just inline the functions
into include/linux/phy.h to keep both options available.
