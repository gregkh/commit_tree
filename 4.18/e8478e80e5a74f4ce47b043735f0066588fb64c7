net/ipv6: Save route type in rt6_info

The RTN_ type for IPv6 FIB entries is currently embedded in rt6i_flags
and dst.error. Since dst is going to be removed, it can no longer be
relied on for FIB dumps so save the route type as fib6_type.

fc_type is set in current users based on the algorithm in rt6_fill_node:
  - rt6i_flags contains RTF_LOCAL: fc_type = RTN_LOCAL
  - rt6i_flags contains RTF_ANYCAST: fc_type = RTN_ANYCAST
  - else fc_type = RTN_UNICAST

Similarly, fib6_type is set in the rt6_info templates based on the
RTF_REJECT section of rt6_fill_node converting dst.error to RTN type.
