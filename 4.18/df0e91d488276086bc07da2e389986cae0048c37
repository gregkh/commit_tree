fuse: atomic_o_trunc should truncate pagecache

Fuse has an "atomic_o_trunc" mode, where userspace filesystem uses the
O_TRUNC flag in the OPEN request to truncate the file atomically with the
open.

In this mode there's no need to send a SETATTR request to userspace after
the open, so fuse_do_setattr() checks this mode and returns.  But this
misses the important step of truncating the pagecache.

Add the missing parts of truncation to the ATTR_OPEN branch.
