PCI: rcar: Shut the PHY down in failpath

If anything fails past phy_init_fn() and the system is a Gen3 with
a PHY, the PHY will be left on and inited. This is caused by the
phy_init_fn, which is in fact a pointer to rcar_pcie_phy_init_gen3()
function, which starts the PHY, yet has no counterpart in the failpath.
Add that counterpart.
