USB: serial: cp210x: add Silicon Labs IDs for Windows Update

Silicon Labs defines alternative VID/PID pairs for some chips that when
used will automatically install drivers for Windows users without manual
intervention. Unfortunately, these IDs are not recognized by the Linux
module, so using these IDs improves user experience on one platform but
degrades it on Linux. This patch addresses this problem.
