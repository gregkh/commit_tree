staging: ks7010: review comment style in ks7010_sdio source file

This commit reviews comment style used in ks7010_sdio source file
in order to be coherent with the rest of the code. Most comments
in this source are before definitions but only two of them have
been written at the right. So, be coherent moving this two to the
top of definitions. Also fix one multiline comment style to use
the normal preferred kernel style.
