ALSA: dice: add cache of stream formats

A previous commit 6f688268b3f4 ('ALSA: dice: purge generating channel
cache') purged cache of stream formats. DICE interface originally has
no feature to assist drivers to retrieve available formats for all of
supported sampling transmission frequencies, without changing the
frequency actually.

For later release of Dice ASICs such as TCD2210, Dice interface has
extended protocol and can support the feature. This assists drivers
to retrieve available stream formats.

This commit is a first step to regain the cache to generate PCM rules
for all of supported sampling transmission frequencies.
