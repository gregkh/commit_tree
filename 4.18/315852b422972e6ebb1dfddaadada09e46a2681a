drm: rcar-du: Fix build failure

Commit 75a07f399cd4 ("drm: rcar-du: Zero-out sg_tables when duplicating
plane state") introduced a reference to the alpha field of struct
rcar_du_vsp_plane_state that got removed in commit 301a9b8d5456
("drm/rcar-du: Convert to the new generic alpha property"). The issue
stems from the merge of the two commits through separate branches and
breaks compilation of the driver. Fix it.
