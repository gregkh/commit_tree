mwifiex: handle race during mwifiex_usb_disconnect

Race condition is observed during rmmod of mwifiex_usb:

1. The rmmod thread will call mwifiex_usb_disconnect(), download
   SHUTDOWN command and do wait_event_interruptible_timeout(),
   waiting for response.

2. The main thread will handle the response and will do a
   wake_up_interruptible(), unblocking rmmod thread.

3. On getting unblocked, rmmod thread  will make rx_cmd.urb = NULL in
   mwifiex_usb_free().

4. The main thread will try to resubmit rx_cmd.urb in
   mwifiex_usb_submit_rx_urb(), which is NULL.

To fix this, move mwifiex_usb_free() from mwifiex_usb_disconnect
to mwifiex_unregister_dev(). Function mwifiex_unregister_dev() is
called after flushing the command and RX work queues.
