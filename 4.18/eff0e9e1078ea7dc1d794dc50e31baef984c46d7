arm/arm64: smccc: Add SMCCC-specific return codes

We've so far used the PSCI return codes for SMCCC because they
were extremely similar. But with the new ARM DEN 0070A specification,
"NOT_REQUIRED" (-2) is clashing with PSCI's "PSCI_RET_INVALID_PARAMS".

Let's bite the bullet and add SMCCC specific return codes. Users
can be repainted as and when required.
