bpf: clean up eBPF helpers documentation

These are minor edits for the eBPF helpers documentation in
include/uapi/linux/bpf.h.

The main fix consists in removing "BPF_FIB_LOOKUP_", because it ends
with a non-escaped underscore that gets interpreted by rst2man and
produces the following message in the resulting manual page:

    DOCUTILS SYSTEM MESSAGES
           System Message: ERROR/3 (/tmp/bpf-helpers.rst:, line 1514)
                  Unknown target name: "bpf_fib_lookup".

Other edits consist in:

- Improving formatting for flag values for "bpf_fib_lookup()" helper.
- Emphasising a parameter name in description of the return value for
  "bpf_get_stack()" helper.
- Removing unnecessary blank lines between "Description" and "Return"
  sections for the few helpers that would use it, for consistency.
