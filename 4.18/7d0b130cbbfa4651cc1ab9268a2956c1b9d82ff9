net: hns3: Fixes the init of the VALID BD info in the descriptor

RX Buffer Descriptor contains a VALID bit which indicates if the BD
is valid and has some data. This field is set by HNS3 hardware to
intimate the driver of some valid data present in the BD. nd should
be reset by the driver when BD is being used again. In the existing
code this bit was not being (re-)initialized properly and hence was
causing problems.
