netfilter: add NAT support for shifted portmap ranges

This is a patch proposal to support shifted ranges in portmaps.  (i.e. tcp/udp
incoming port 5000-5100 on WAN redirected to LAN 192.168.1.5:2000-2100)

Currently DNAT only works for single port or identical port ranges.  (i.e.
ports 5000-5100 on WAN interface redirected to a LAN host while original
destination port is not altered) When different port ranges are configured,
either 'random' mode should be used, or else all incoming connections are
mapped onto the first port in the redirect range. (in described example
WAN:5000-5100 will all be mapped to 192.168.1.5:2000)

This patch introduces a new mode indicated by flag NF_NAT_RANGE_PROTO_OFFSET
which uses a base port value to calculate an offset with the destination port
present in the incoming stream. That offset is then applied as index within the
redirect port range (index modulo rangewidth to handle range overflow).

In described example the base port would be 5000. An incoming stream with
destination port 5004 would result in an offset value 4 which means that the
NAT'ed stream will be using destination port 2004.

Other possibilities include deterministic mapping of larger or multiple ranges
to a smaller range : WAN:5000-5999 -> LAN:5000-5099 (maps WAN port 5*xx to port
51xx)

This patch does not change any current behavior. It just adds new NAT proto
range functionality which must be selected via the specific flag when intended
to use.

A patch for iptables (libipt_DNAT.c + libip6t_DNAT.c) will also be proposed
which makes this functionality immediately available.
