ath10k: avoid possible string overflow

The way that 'strncat' is used here raised a warning in gcc-8:

drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/wmi.c: In function 'ath10k_wmi_tpc_stats_final_disp_tables':
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/wmi.c:4649:4: error: 'strncat' output truncated before terminating nul copying as many bytes from a string as its length [-Werror=stringop-truncation]

Effectively, this is simply a strcat() but the use of strncat() suggests
some form of overflow check. Regardless of whether this might actually
overflow, using strlcat() instead of strncat() avoids the warning and
makes the code more robust.
