drm/i915: Disable tasklet scheduling across initial scheduling

During request submission, we call the engine->schedule() function so
that we may reorder the active requests as required for inheriting the
new request's priority. This may schedule several tasklets to run on the
local CPU, but we will need to schedule the tasklets again for the new
request. Delay all the local tasklets until the end, so that we only
have to process the queue just once.

v2: Beware PREEMPT_RCU, as then local_bh_disable() is then not a
superset of rcu_read_lock().
