net/ipv6: Create a neigh_lookup for FIB entries

The router discovery code has a FIB entry and wants to validate the
gateway has a neighbor entry. Refactor the existing dst_neigh_lookup
for IPv6 and create a new function that takes the gateway and device
and returns a neighbor entry. Use the new function in
ndisc_router_discovery to validate the gateway.
