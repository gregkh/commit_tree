udp: Record gso_segs when supporting UDP segmentation offload

We need to record the number of segments that will be generated when this
frame is segmented. The expectation is that if gso_size is set then
gso_segs is set as well. Without this some drivers such as ixgbe get
confused if they attempt to offload this as they record 0 segments for the
entire packet instead of the correct value.
