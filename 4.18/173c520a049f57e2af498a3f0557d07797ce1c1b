KVM: PPC: Move nip/ctr/lr/xer registers to pt_regs in kvm_vcpu_arch

This patch moves nip/ctr/lr/xer registers from scattered places in
kvm_vcpu_arch to pt_regs structure.

cr register is "unsigned long" in pt_regs and u32 in vcpu->arch.
It will need more consideration and may move in later patches.
