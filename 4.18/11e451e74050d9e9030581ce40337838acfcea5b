drm/nouveau: remove fence wait code from deferred client work handler

Fences attached to deferred client work items now originate from channels
belonging to the client, meaning we can be certain they've been signalled
before we destroy a client.

This closes a race that could happen if the dma_fence_wait_timeout() call
didn't succeed.  When the fence was later signalled, a use-after-free was
possible.
