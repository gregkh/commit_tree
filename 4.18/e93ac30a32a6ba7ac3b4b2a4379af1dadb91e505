ALSA: hda/ca0132: add extra init functions for r3di + sbz

This patch adds extra init functions for the Sound Blaster Z and
Recon3Di. It also adds more checks to make sure that the DSP isn't
downloaded twice on startup, by checking if the dsp_state is already set
to DSP_DOWNLOADED. It also adds the ability to re-download the DSP on a
resume.

It also changes the init verbs table to apply to all codecs, and takes
the two specific end verbs and puts them into a separate function in
ca0132_init instead.

GPIO functions are also added.
