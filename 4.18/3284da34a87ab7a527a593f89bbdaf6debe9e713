s390/dasd: reduce the default queue depth and nr of hardware queues

Reduce the default values for the number of hardware queues and queue depth
to significantly reduce the memory footprint of a DASD device.
The memory consumption per DASD device reduces from approximately 40MB to
approximately 1.5MB.

This is necessary to build systems with a large number of DASD devices and
a reasonable amount of memory.
Performance measurements showed that good performance results are possible
with the new default values even on systems with lots of CPUs and lots of
alias devices.
