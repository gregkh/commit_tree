arm64: dts: rockchip: enable typec-phy for rk3399-firefly

Commit c301b327aea898af ("arm64: dts: rockchip: add usb3-phy otg-port
support for rk3399") caused a regression regarding the USB3. During boot,
the following message appears a few times:

      dwc3: failed to initialize core

The driver is deferred waiting for the typec-phy, but this never happens
beause is disabled. So, enable it.

The offending commit was reverted in 4.16-rc but can be re-applied
after enabling the typec phys.
