PCI/IOV: Add pci_sriov_configure_simple()

SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) is an optional PCIe capability (see
PCIe r4.0, sec 9).  A PCIe Function with the SR-IOV capability is referred
to as a PF (Physical Function).  If SR-IOV is enabled on the PF, several
VFs (Virtual Functions) may be created.  The VFs can be individually
assigned to virtual machines, which allows them to share a single hardware
device while being isolated from each other.

Some SR-IOV devices have resources such as queues and interrupts that must
be set up in the PF before enabling the VFs, so they require a PF driver to
do that.

Other SR-IOV devices don't require any PF setup before enabling VFs.  Add a
pci_sriov_configure_simple() interface so PF drivers for such devices can
use it without repeating the VF-enabling code.
