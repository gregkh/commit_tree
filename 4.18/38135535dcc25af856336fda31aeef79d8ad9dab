scsi: ufs: add reference counting for scsi block requests

Currently we call the scsi_block_requests()/scsi_unblock_requests()
whenever we want to block/unblock scsi requests but as there is no
reference counting, nesting of these calls could leave us in undesired
state sometime. Consider following call flow sequence:

1. func1() calls scsi_block_requests() but calls func2() before
   calling scsi_unblock_requests()
2. func2() calls scsi_block_requests()
3. func2() calls scsi_unblock_requests()
4. func1() calls scsi_unblock_requests()

As there is no reference counting, we will have scsi requests unblocked
after #3 instead of it to be unblocked only after #4. Though we may not
have failures seen with this, we might run into some failures in future.
Better solution would be to fix this by adding reference counting.
