powerpc/modules: remove unused mod_arch_specific.toc field

The toc field in the mod_arch_specific struct isn't actually used
anywhere, so remove it.

Also the ftrace-specific fields are now common between 32-bit and
64-bit, so simplify the struct definition a bit by moving them out of
the __powerpc64__ #ifdef.
