drm/amd/pp: Adding set_watermarks_for_clocks_ranges for SMU10

The function is never implemented for raven on linux.
It follows similair implementation as on windows.

SMU still needs to notify SMC and copy WM table, which is added
here. But on other Asics such as Vega this step is not implemented.
