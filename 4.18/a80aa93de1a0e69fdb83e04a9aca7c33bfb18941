drm/amd/display: Unify dm resume sequence into a single call

Merge amdgpu_dm_display_resume function into dm_resume,
as it is not called anywhere else anymore.

Initially the call was broken down into 2 functions for cursor corruption
issue. Now the issue is not visible, hence the dm_resume will perform
dm_display_resume in it.
