clk: sunxi-ng: r40: export a regmap to access the GMAC register

There's a GMAC configuration register, which exists on A64/A83T/H3/H5 in
the syscon part, in the CCU of R40 SoC.

Export a regmap of the CCU.

Read access is not restricted to all registers, but only the GMAC
register is allowed to be written.
