ipv4: remove BUG_ON() from fib_compute_spec_dst

Remove BUG_ON() from fib_compute_spec_dst routine and check
in_dev pointer during flowi4 data structure initialization.
fib_compute_spec_dst routine can be run concurrently with device removal
where ip_ptr net_device pointer is set to NULL. This can happen
if userspace enables pkt info on UDP rx socket and the device
is removed while traffic is flowing
