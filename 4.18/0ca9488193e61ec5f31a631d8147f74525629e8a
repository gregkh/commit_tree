drm/i915/glk: Add Quirk for GLK NUC HDMI port issues.

On GLK NUC platforms the HDMI retiming buffer needs additional disabled
time to correctly sync to a faster incoming signal.

When measured on a scope the highspeed lines of the HDMI clock turn off
 for ~400uS during a normal resolution change. The HDMI retimer on the
 GLK NUC appears to require at least a full frame of quiet time before a
new faster clock can be correctly sync'd. Wait 100ms due to msleep
inaccuracies while waiting for a completed frame. Add a quirk to the
driver for GLK boards that use ITE66317 HDMI retimers.

V2: Add more devices to the quirk list
V3: Delay increased to 100ms, check to confirm crtc type is HDMI.
V4: crtc type check extended to include _DDI and whitespace fixes
v5: Fix white spaces, remove the macro for delay. Revert the crtc type
    check introduced in v4.
