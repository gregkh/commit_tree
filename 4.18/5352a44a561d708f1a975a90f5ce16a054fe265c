PCI: pciehp: Make pciehp_is_native() stricter

Previously pciehp_is_native() returned true for any PCI device in a
hierarchy where _OSC says we can use pciehp.  This is incorrect because
bridges without PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_HPC capability should be managed by acpiphp
instead.

Improve pciehp_is_native() to return true only when PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_HPC is
set and the pciehp driver is present.  In any other case return false
to let acpiphp handle those.
