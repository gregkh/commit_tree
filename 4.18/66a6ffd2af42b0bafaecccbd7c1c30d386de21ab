mm: combine first three unions in struct page

By combining these three one-word unions into one three-word union, we
make it easier for users to add their own multi-word fields to struct
page, as well as making it obvious that SLUB needs to keep its double-word
alignment for its freelist & counters.

No field moves position; verified with pahole.
