Documentation/features: Add script that refreshes the arch support status files in place

Provides the script:

	Documentation/features/scripts/features-refresh.sh

which operates on the arch-support.txt files and refreshes them in place.

This way [1],

   "[...] we soft- decouple the refreshing of the entries from the
    introduction of the features, while still making it all easy to
    keep sync and to extend."
