samples: bpf: convert some XDP samples from bpf_load to libbpf

Now that we can use full powers of libbpf in BPF samples, we
should perhaps make the simplest XDP programs not depend on
bpf_load helpers.  This way newcomers will be exposed to the
recommended library from the start.

Use of bpf_prog_load_xattr() will also make it trivial to later
on request offload of the programs by simply adding ifindex to
the xattr.
