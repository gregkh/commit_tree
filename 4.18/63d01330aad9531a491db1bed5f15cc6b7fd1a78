sctp: honor PMTU_DISABLED when handling icmp

sctp_sendmsg() could trigger PMTU updates even when PMTU_DISABLED was
set, as pmtu_pending could be set unconditionally during icmp handling
if the socket was in use by the application.

This patch fixes it by checking for PMTU_DISABLED when handling such
deferred updates.
