ARM: dts: imx25-pdk: Remove unneeded 'codec-handle' property

The 'codec-handle' property is an optional one and there is really
no need to be used here.

As per the comment in the fsl_ssi driver:

"Backward compatible for older bindings by manually triggering the
machine driver's probe()."

,so just remove such uneeded property.
