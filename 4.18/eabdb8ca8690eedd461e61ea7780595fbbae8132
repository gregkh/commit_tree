powerpc/pkeys: Detach execute_only key on !PROT_EXEC

Disassociate the exec_key from a VMA if the VMA permission is not
PROT_EXEC anymore. Otherwise the exec_only key continues to be
associated with the vma, causing unexpected behavior.

The problem was reported on x86 by Shakeel Butt, which is also
applicable on powerpc.
