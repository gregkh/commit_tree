tracing/kprobes: Fix trace_probe flags on enable_trace_kprobe() failure

If enable_trace_kprobe fails to enable the probe in enable_k(ret)probe
it returns an error, but does not unset the tp flags it set previously.
This results in a probe being considered enabled and failures like being
unable to remove the probe through kprobe_events file since probes_open()
expects every probe to be disabled.
