PCI: rockchip: Separate common code from RC driver

In preparation for introducing EP driver for Rockchip PCIe controller,
rename the RC driver from pcie-rockchip.c to pcie-rockchip-host.c, and
only leave some common functions in pcie-rockchip.c in order to be
reused for both of RC driver and EP driver.
