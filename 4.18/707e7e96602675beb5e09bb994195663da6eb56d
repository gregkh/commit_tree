bnxt_en: Always forward VF MAC address to the PF.

The current code already forwards the VF MAC address to the PF, except
in one case.  If the VF driver gets a valid MAC address from the firmware
during probe time, it will not forward the MAC address to the PF,
incorrectly assuming that the PF already knows the MAC address.  This
causes "ip link show" to show zero VF MAC addresses for this case.

This assumption is not correct.  Newer firmware remembers the VF MAC
address last used by the VF and provides it to the VF driver during
probe.  So we need to always forward the VF MAC address to the PF.

The forwarded MAC address may now be the PF assigned MAC address and so we
need to make sure we approve it for this case.
