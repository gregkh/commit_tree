s390: Correct register corruption in critical section cleanup

In the critical section cleanup we must not mess with r1.  For march=z9
or older, larl + ex (instead of exrl) are used with r1 as a temporary
register. This can clobber r1 in several interrupt handlers. Fix this by
using r11 as a temp register.  r11 is being saved by all callers of
cleanup_critical.
