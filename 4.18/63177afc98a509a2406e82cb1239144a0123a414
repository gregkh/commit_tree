ALSA: hda/ca0132: Add pincfg for SBZ + R3Di, add fp hp auto-detect

This patch adds an unsolicited response tag for the front headphone
panel which uses the same hp_callback as the rear headphone detection.

This patch also adds pincfgs for the R3Di and SBZ which were taken from
the Windows driver. The pins are also defined in the function
ca0132_config. Both the R3Di and SBZ are also given a max out channel
value of 6 to handle 5.1 surround sound in later patches.
