mm/shmem.c: zero out unused vma fields in shmem_pseudo_vma_init()

shmem/tmpfs uses pseudo vma to allocate page with correct NUMA policy.

The pseudo vma doesn't have vm_page_prot set.  We are going to encode
encryption KeyID in vm_page_prot.  Having garbage there causes problems.

Zero out all unused fields in the pseudo vma.
