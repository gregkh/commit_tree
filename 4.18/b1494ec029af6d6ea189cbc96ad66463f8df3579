perf tools: Update x86's syscall_64.tbl, adding 'io_pgetevents' and 'rseq'

This updates the tools/perf/ copy of the system call table for x86 which makes
'perf trace' become aware of the new 'io_pgetevents' and 'rseq' syscalls, no
matter in which system it gets built, i.e. older systems where the syscalls are
not available in the running kernel (via tracefs) or in the system headers will
still be aware of these syscalls/.

These are the csets introducing the source drift:

  05c17cedf85b ("x86: Wire up restartable sequence system call")
  7a074e96dee6 ("aio: implement io_pgetevents")

This results in this build time change:

This silences the following tools/perf/ build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl'
