nvme-pci: make CMB SQ mod-param read-only

A controller reset after a run time change of the CMB module parameter
breaks the driver. An 'on -> off' will have the driver use NULL for the
host memory queue, and 'off -> on' will use mismatched queue depth between
the device and the host.

We could fix both, but there isn't really a good reason to change this
at run time anyway, compared to at module load time, so this patch makes
parameter read-only after after modprobe.
