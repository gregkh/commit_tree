media: v4l: cadence: Add Cadence MIPI-CSI2 RX driver

The Cadence CSI-2 RX Controller is an hardware block meant to be used as a
bridge between a CSI-2 bus and pixel grabbers.

It supports operating with internal or external D-PHY, with up to 4 lanes,
or without any D-PHY. The current code only supports the latter case.

It also support dynamic mapping of the CSI-2 virtual channels to the
associated pixel grabbers, but that isn't allowed at the moment either.
