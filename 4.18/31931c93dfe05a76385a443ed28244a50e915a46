signal: Extend siginfo_layout with SIL_FAULT_{MCEERR|BNDERR|PKUERR}

Update the siginfo_layout function and enum siginfo_layout to represent
all of the possible field layouts of struct siginfo.

This allows the uses of siginfo_layout in um and arm64 where they are testing
for SIL_FAULT to be more accurate as this rules out the other cases.

Further this allows the switch statements on siginfo_layout to be simpler
if perhaps a little more wordy.  Making it easier to understand what is
actually going on.

As SIL_FAULT_BNDERR and SIL_FAULT_PKUERR are never expected to appear
in signalfd just treat them as SIL_FAULT.  To include them would take
20 extra bytes an pretty much fill up what is left of
signalfd_siginfo.
