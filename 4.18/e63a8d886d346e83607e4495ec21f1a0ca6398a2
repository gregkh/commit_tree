scsi: cxlflash: Use local mutex for AFU serialization

AFUs can only process a single AFU command at a time. This is enforced with
a global mutex situated within the AFU send routine. As this mutex has a
global scope, it has the potential to unnecessarily block commands destined
for other AFUs.

Instead of using a global mutex, transition the mutex to be per-AFU. This
will allow commands to only be blocked by siblings of the same AFU.
