virtio_net: split XDP_TX kick and XDP_REDIRECT map flushing

The driver was combining XDP_TX virtqueue_kick and XDP_REDIRECT
map flushing (xdp_do_flush_map).  This is suboptimal, these two
flush operations should be kept separate.

The suboptimal behavior was introduced in commit 9267c430c6b6
("virtio-net: add missing virtqueue kick when flushing packets").
