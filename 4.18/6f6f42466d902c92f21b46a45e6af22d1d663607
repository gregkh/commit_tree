PCI: shpchp: Manage SHPC unconditionally on non-ACPI systems

An SHPC can be operated either by platform firmware or by the OS.  The OS
uses a host bridge ACPI _OSC method to negotiate for control of SHPC.  If
firmware wants to prevent an OS from operating an SHPC, it must supply an
_OSC method that declines to grant SHPC ownership to the OS.

If acpi_pci_find_root() returns NULL, it means there's no ACPI host bridge
device (PNP0A03 or PNP0A08) and hence no _OSC method, so the OS is always
allowed to manage the SHPC.

Fix a NULL pointer dereference when CONFIG_ACPI=y but the current
hardware/firmware platform doesn't support ACPI.  In that case,
acpi_get_hp_hw_control_from_firmware() is implemented but
acpi_pci_find_root() returns NULL.
