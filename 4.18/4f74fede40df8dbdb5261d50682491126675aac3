bpf: Add mtu checking to FIB forwarding helper

Add check that egress MTU can handle packet to be forwarded. If
the MTU is less than the packet length, return 0 meaning the
packet is expected to continue up the stack for help - eg.,
fragmenting the packet or sending an ICMP.

The XDP path needs to leverage the FIB entry for an MTU on the
route spec or an exception entry for a given destination. The
skb path lets is_skb_forwardable decide if the packet can be
sent.
