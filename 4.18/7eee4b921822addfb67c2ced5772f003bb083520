scsi: hisi_sas: relocate smp sg map

Currently we use DQ lock to protect delivery of DQ entry one by one.

To optimise to allow more than one slot to be built for a single DQ in
parallel, we need to remove the DQ lock when preparing slots, prior to
delivery.

To achieve this, we rearrange the slot build order to ensure that once
we allocate a slot for a task, we do cannot fail to deliver the task.

In this patch, we rearrange the slot building for SMP tasks to ensure
that sg mapping part (which can fail) happens before we allocate the
slot in the DQ.
