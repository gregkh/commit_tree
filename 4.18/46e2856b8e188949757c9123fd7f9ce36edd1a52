cpufreq: Add Kryo CPU scaling driver

In Certain QCOM SoCs like apq8096 and msm8996 that have KRYO processors,
the CPU frequency subset and voltage value of each OPP varies
based on the silicon variant in use. Qualcomm Process Voltage Scaling Tables
defines the voltage and frequency value based on the msm-id in SMEM
and speedbin blown in the efuse combination.
The qcom-cpufreq-kryo driver reads the msm-id and efuse value from the SoC
to provide the OPP framework with required information.
This is used to determine the voltage and frequency value for each OPP of
operating-points-v2 table when it is parsed by the OPP framework.
