net/smc: optimize consumer cursor updates

The SMC protocol requires to send a separate consumer cursor update,
if it cannot be piggybacked to updates of the producer cursor.
Currently the decision to send a separate consumer cursor update
just considers the amount of data already received by the socket
program. It does not consider the amount of data already arrived, but
not yet consumed by the receiver. Basing the decision on the
difference between already confirmed and already arrived data
(instead of difference between already confirmed and already consumed
data), may lead to a somewhat earlier consumer cursor update send in
fast unidirectional traffic scenarios, and thus to better throughput.
