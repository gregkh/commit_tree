i2c-cht-wc: Fix bq24190 supplier

Commit f2a8aa053c17 ("typec: tcpm: Represent source supply through
power_supply") moved the code to register a power_supply representing
the device supplying power to the type-C connector, from the fusb302
code to the generic tcpm code.

This has caused the power-supply registered by the fusb302 driver,
which determines how much current the bq24190 can draw, to change name
from "fusb302-typec-source" to "tcpm-source-psy-i2c-fusb302".
