srcu: Add cleanup_srcu_struct_quiesced()

The current cleanup_srcu_struct() flushes work, which prevents it
from being invoked from some workqueue contexts, as well as from
atomic (non-blocking) contexts.  This patch therefore introduced a
cleanup_srcu_struct_quiesced(), which can be invoked only after all
activity on the specified srcu_struct has completed.  This restriction
allows cleanup_srcu_struct_quiesced() to be invoked from workqueue
contexts as well as from atomic contexts.
