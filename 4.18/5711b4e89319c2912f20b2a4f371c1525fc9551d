netfilter: nf_tproxy: fix possible non-linear access to transport header

This patch fixes a silent out-of-bound read possibility that was present
because of the misuse of this function.

Mostly it was called with a struct udphdr *hp which had only the udphdr
part linearized by the skb_header_pointer, however
nf_tproxy_get_sock_v{4,6} uses it as a tcphdr pointer, so some reads for
tcp specific attributes may be invalid.

Fixes: a583636a83ea ("inet: refactor inet[6]_lookup functions to take skb")
