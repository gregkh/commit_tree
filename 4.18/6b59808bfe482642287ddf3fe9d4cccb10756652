workqueue: Show the latest workqueue name in /proc/PID/{comm,stat,status}

There can be a lot of workqueue workers and they all show up with the
cryptic kworker/* names making it difficult to understand which is
doing what and how they came to be.

  # ps -ef | grep kworker
  root           4       2  0 Feb25 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/0:0H]
  root           6       2  0 Feb25 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/u112:0]
  root          19       2  0 Feb25 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/1:0H]
  root          25       2  0 Feb25 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/2:0H]
  root          31       2  0 Feb25 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/3:0H]
  ...

This patch makes workqueue workers report the latest workqueue it was
executing for through /proc/PID/{comm,stat,status}.  The extra
information is appended to the kthread name with intervening '+' if
currently executing, otherwise '-'.

  # cat /proc/25/comm
  kworker/2:0-events_power_efficient
  # cat /proc/25/stat
  25 (kworker/2:0-events_power_efficient) I 2 0 0 0 -1 69238880 0 0...
  # grep Name /proc/25/status
  Name:   kworker/2:0-events_power_efficient

Unfortunately, ps(1) truncates comm to 15 characters,

  # ps 25
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
     25 ?        I      0:00 [kworker/2:0-eve]

making it a lot less useful; however, this should be an easy fix from
ps(1) side.
