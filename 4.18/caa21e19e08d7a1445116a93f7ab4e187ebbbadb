net/smc: no shutdown in state SMC_LISTEN

Invoking shutdown for a socket in state SMC_LISTEN does not make
sense. Nevertheless programs like syzbot fuzzing the kernel may
try to do this. For SMC this means a socket refcounting problem.
This patch makes sure a shutdown call for an SMC socket in state
SMC_LISTEN simply returns with -ENOTCONN.
