video: fbdev: aty: radeon_pm: Replace mdelay with msleep in radeonfb_pci_suspend

radeonfb_pci_suspend() is never called in atomic context.

radeonfb_pci_suspend() is only set as ".suspend" in struct pci_driver.
This function is not called in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, radeonfb_pci_suspend()
calls mdelay() to busily wait.
This is not necessary and can be replaced with msleep() 
and usleep_range() to avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
