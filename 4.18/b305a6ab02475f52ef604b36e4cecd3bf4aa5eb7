mt7601u: use EWMA to calculate avg_rssi

avr_rssi is not calculated correctly as we do not divide result
by 256 (mt76 sum avg_rssi1 and avg_rssi2 and divide by 512).
However dividing by 256 will make avg_rssi almost the same as
last rssi value - not really an average. So use EWMA to calculate
avg_rssi. I've chosen weight_rcp=4 to convergence quicker on signal
strength changes.
