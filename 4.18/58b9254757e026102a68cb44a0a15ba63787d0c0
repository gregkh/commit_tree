tracing: Have event_trace_init() called by trace_init_tracefs()

Instead of having both trace_init_tracefs() and event_trace_init() be called
by fs_initcall() routines, have event_trace_init() called directly by
trace_init_tracefs(). This will guarantee order of how the events are
created with respect to the rest of the ftrace infrastructure. This is
needed to be able to assoctiate event files with ftrace internal events,
such as the trace_marker.
