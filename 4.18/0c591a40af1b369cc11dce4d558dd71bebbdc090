drm/i915: Mark up nested spinlocks

When we process the outstanding requests upon banning a context, we need
to acquire both the engine and the client's timeline, nesting the locks.
This requires explicit markup as the two timelines are now of the same
class, since commit a89d1f921c15 ("drm/i915: Split i915_gem_timeline into
individual timelines").

Testcase: igt/gem_eio/banned
Fixes: a89d1f921c15 ("drm/i915: Split i915_gem_timeline into individual timelines")
