crypto: cavium - Fix smp_processor_id() warnings

Switch to raw_smp_processor_id() to prevent a number of
warnings from kernel debugging. We do not care about
preemption here, as the CPU number is only used as a
poor mans load balancing or device selection. If preemption
happens during a compress/decompress operation a small performance
hit will occur but everything will continue to work, so just
ignore it.
