ixgbe: Avoid loopback and fix boolean logic in ipsec_stop_data

This patch fixes two issues. First we add an early test for the Tx and Rx
security block ready bits. By doing this we can avoid the need for waits or
loopback in the event that the security block is already flushed out.
Secondly we fix the boolean logic that was testing for the Tx OR Rx ready
bits being set and change it so that we only exit if the Tx AND Rx ready
bits are both set.
