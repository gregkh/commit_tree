drm/amdkfd: Clean up KFD_MMAP_ offset handling

Use bit-rotate for better clarity and remove _MASK from the #defines as
these represent mmap types.

Centralize all the parsing of the mmap offset in kfd_mmap and add device
parameter to doorbell and reserved_mem map functions.

Encode gpu_id into upper bits of vm_pgoff. This frees up the lower bits
for encoding the the doorbell ID on Vega10.
