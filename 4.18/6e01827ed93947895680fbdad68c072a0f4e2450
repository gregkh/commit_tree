usb: do not reset if a low-speed or full-speed device timed out

Some low-speed and full-speed devices (for example, bluetooth)
do not have time to initialize. For them, ETIMEDOUT is a valid error.
We need to give them another try. Otherwise, they will
never be initialized correctly and in dmesg will be messages
"Bluetooth: hci0 command 0x1002 tx timeout" or similars.
