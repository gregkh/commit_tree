selftests: cgroup: add memory controller self-tests

Cgroups are used for controlling the physical resource distribution
(memory, CPU, io, etc) and often are used as basic building blocks
for large distributed computing systems. Even small differences
in the actual behavior may lead to significant incidents.

The codebase is under the active development, which will unlikely
stop at any time soon. Also it's scattered over different kernel
subsystems, which makes regressions more probable.

Given that, the lack of any tests is crying.

This patch implements some basic tests for the memory controller,
as well as a minimal required framework. It doesn't pretend for a
very good coverage, but pretends to be a starting point.

Hopefully, any following significant changes will include corresponding
tests.

Tests for CPU and io controllers, as well as cgroup core
are next in the todo list.
