pinctrl: actions: fix missing break in PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_STRENGTH case.

There is a missing break in case PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_STRENGTH leading to
a fall-through to the PIN_CONFIG_SLEW_RATE case that performs different
checks against *arg. This looks like an unintentional missing break so
add in the break.
