fsnotify: use type id to identify connector object type

An fsnotify_mark_connector is referencing a single type of object
(either inode or vfsmount). Instead of storing a type mask in
connector->flags, store a single type id in connector->type to
identify the type of object.

When a connector object is detached from the object, its type is set
to FSNOTIFY_OBJ_TYPE_DETACHED and this object is not going to be
reused.

The function fsnotify_clear_marks_by_group() is the only place where
type mask was used, so use type flags instead of type id to this
function.

This change is going to be more convenient when adding a new object
type (super block).
