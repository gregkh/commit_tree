UBIFS: Fix potential integer overflow in allocation

There is potential for the size and len fields in ubifs_data_node to be
too large causing either a negative value for the length fields or an
integer overflow leading to an incorrect memory allocation. Likewise,
when the len field is small, an integer underflow may occur.
