clk: qcom: mmcc-msm8996: leave all mmagic gdscs and clocks always enabled

There's no bus infrastructure today to handle all the mmagic bus
clocks and GDSCs needed by all the multimedia blocks in msm8996, like
mdss, video, camera and gpu. Mark all these clocks with a CLK_IS_CRITICAL
and GDSCs with a ALWAYS_ON flag for now so they are left always enabled.
This patch should be reverted at some point when we do have a bus driver
to manage these clocks and GDSCs.
