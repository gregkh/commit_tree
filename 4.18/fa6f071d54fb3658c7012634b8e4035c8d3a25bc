drm/i915: move gen8 irq shifts to intel_lrc.c

The only usage outside the intel_lrc.c file is in the ringbuffer
init, but the irq mask calculated there is then overwritten for
all engines that have a non-zero shift, so we can drop it.

This change is not aimed at code saving but at removing from
intel_engines information that does not apply to all gens that have
the engine. When checking without the temporary WARN_ON, code size
is basically unchanged.

v2: make the irq_shifts array static const
v3: rebase, move irq_shifts array to logical_ring_default_irqs
v4: move array inside the if and use u8 for it (Chris)
