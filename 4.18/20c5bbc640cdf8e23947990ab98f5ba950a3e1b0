btrfs: restore uuid_mutex in btrfs_open_devices

Commit 542c5908abfe84f7b4c1 ("btrfs: replace uuid_mutex by
device_list_mutex in btrfs_open_devices") switched to device_list_mutex
as we need that for the device list traversal, but we also need
uuid_mutex to protect access to fs_devices::opened to be consistent with
other users of that.
