rcu: Remove deprecated RCU debugfs tracing code

Commit ae91aa0adb14 ("rcu: Remove debugfs tracing") removed the
RCU debugfs tracing code, but did not remove the no-longer used
->exp_workdone{0,1,2,3} fields in the srcu_data structure.  This commit
therefore removes these fields along with the code that uselessly
updates them.
