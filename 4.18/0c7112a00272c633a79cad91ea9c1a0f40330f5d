drm/i915: Rename priotree to sched

Having moved the priotree struct into i915_scheduler.h, identify it as
the scheduling element and rebrand into i915_sched. This becomes more
useful as we start attaching more information we require to propagate
through the scheduler.

v2: Use i915_sched_node for future distinctiveness
