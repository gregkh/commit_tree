ALSA: hda: Add Gigabyte P55A-UD3 and Z87-D3HP to the power_save blacklist

Power-saving is causing plops on audio start/stop on Gigabyte
P55A-UD3 and Gigabyte Z87-D3HP machines, add these to the power_save
blacklist.

Note these 2 boards both use 1458:a002 as subsystem ids, so they share
a single entry.
