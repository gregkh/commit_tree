ALSA: pcm: Clean up with snd_pcm_avail() and snd_pcm_hw_avail() helpers

Introduce two new direction-neutral helpers to calculate the avail and
hw_avail values, and clean up the code with them.

The two separated forward and rewind functions are gathered to the
unified functions.

No functional change but only code reductions.
