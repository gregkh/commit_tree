alim15x3: move irq-restore before pci_dev_put()

init_chipset_ali15x3() initializes the chipset during init with disabled
interrupts. There is no need to keep the interrupts disabled during
pci_dev_put().
Move the irq-restore before pci_dev_put() is invoked.

Side note: The same init is performed in
drivers/ata/pata_ali.c::ali_init_chipset() without disabled interrupts.
It looks that the same hardware is supported in the ATA land. Would it
make sense to remove this driver since it is supported in the other
subsystem?
