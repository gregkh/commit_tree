scsi: target: Fix truncated PR-in ReadKeys response

SPC5r17 states that the contents of the ADDITIONAL LENGTH field are not
altered based on the allocation length, so always calculate and pack the
full key list length even if the list itself is truncated.

According to Maged:

  Yes it fixes the "Storage Spaces Persistent Reservation" test in the
  Windows 2016 Server Failover Cluster validation suites when having
  many connections that result in more than 8 registrations. I tested
  your patch on 4.17 with iblock.

This behaviour can be tested using the libiscsi PrinReadKeys.Truncate test.
