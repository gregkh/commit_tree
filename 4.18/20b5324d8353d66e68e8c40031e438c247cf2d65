cpufreq: optimize cpufreq_notify_transition()

cpufreq_notify_transition() calls __cpufreq_notify_transition() for each
CPU of a policy. There is a lot of code in __cpufreq_notify_transition()
though which isn't required to be executed for each CPU, like checking
about disabled cpufreq or irqs, adjusting jiffies, updating cpufreq
stats and some debug print messages.

This commit merges __cpufreq_notify_transition() into
cpufreq_notify_transition() and modifies cpufreq_notify_transition() to
execute minimum amount of code for each CPU.

Also fix the kerneldoc for cpufreq_notify_transition() while at it.
