phy: mapphone-mdm6600: Fix wrong enum used for status lines

Kbuilt test robot reported:

drivers/phy/motorola/phy-mapphone-mdm6600.c:188:16: warning:  is used
uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
        val |= values[i] << i;
               ~~~~~~^~~

Looking at the phy_mdm6600_status() values does get initialized by
gpiod_get_array_value_cansleep(), but we are using wrong enum
in that function. Let's fix the use, both end up being three though
so urgent rush on this one AFAIK.
