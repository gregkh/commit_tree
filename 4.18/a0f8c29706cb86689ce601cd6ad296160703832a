kconfig: tinyconfig: remove stale stack protector fixups

Prior to commit 2a61f4747eea ("stack-protector: test compiler capability
in Kconfig and drop AUTO mode"), the stack protector was configured by
the choice of NONE, REGULAR, STRONG, AUTO.

tiny.config needed to explicitly set NONE because the default value of
choice, AUTO, did not produce the tiniest kernel.

Now that there are only two boolean symbols, STACKPROTECTOR and
STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG, they are naturally disabled by "make
allnoconfig", which "make tinyconfig" is based on.  Remove unnecessary
lines from the tiny.config fragment file.
