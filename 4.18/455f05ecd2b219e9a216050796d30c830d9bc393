vsock: split dwork to avoid reinitializations

syzbot reported that we reinitialize an active delayed
work in vsock_stream_connect():

	ODEBUG: init active (active state 0) object type: timer_list hint:
	delayed_work_timer_fn+0x0/0x90 kernel/workqueue.c:1414
	WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 11518 at lib/debugobjects.c:329
	debug_print_object+0x16a/0x210 lib/debugobjects.c:326

The pattern is apparently wrong, we should only initialize
the dealyed work once and could repeatly schedule it. So we
have to move out the initializations to allocation side.
And to avoid confusion, we can split the shared dwork
into two, instead of re-using the same one.
