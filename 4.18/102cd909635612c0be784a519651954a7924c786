qmi_wwan: apply SET_DTR quirk to the SIMCOM shared device ID

SIMCOM are reusing a single device ID for many (all of their?)
different modems, based on different chipsets and firmwares. Newer
Qualcomm chipset generations require setting DTR to wake the QMI
function.  The SIM7600E modem is using such a chipset, making it
fail to work with this driver despite the device ID match.

Fix by unconditionally enabling the SET_DTR quirk for all SIMCOM
modems using this specific device ID.  This is similar to what
we already have done for another case of device IDs recycled over
multiple chipset generations: 14cf4a771b30 ("drivers: net: usb:
qmi_wwan: add QMI_QUIRK_SET_DTR for Telit PID 0x1201")

Initial testing on an older SIM7100 modem shows no immediate side
effects.
