firmware: arm_scmi: rename scmi_xfer_{init,get,put}

Just after the initial patches were queued, Jonathan Cameron mentioned
that scmi_one_xfer_{get_put} were not very clear and suggested to use
scmi_xfer_{alloc,free}. While I agree to some extent, the reason not to
have alloc/free as these are preallocated buffers and these functions
just returns a reference to free slot in that preallocated array.
However it was agreed to drop "_one" as it's implicit that we are always
dealing with one slot anyways.

This patch updates the name accordingly dropping "_one" in both {get,put}
functions. Also scmi_one_xfer_init is renamed as scmi_xfer_get_init to
reflect the fact that it gets the free slots and then initialise it.
