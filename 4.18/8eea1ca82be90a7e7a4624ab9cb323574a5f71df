gso: limit udp gso to egress-only virtual devices

Until the udp receive stack supports large packets (UDP GRO), GSO
packets must not loop from the egress to the ingress path.

Revert the change that added NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_L4 to various virtual
devices through NETIF_F_GSO_ENCAP_ALL as this included devices that
may loop packets, such as veth and macvlan.

Instead add it to specific devices that forward to another device's
egress path, bonding and team.
