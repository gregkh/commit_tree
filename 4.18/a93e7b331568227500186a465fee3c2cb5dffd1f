uio: Prevent device destruction while fds are open

Prevent destruction of a uio_device while user space apps hold open
file descriptors to that device. Further, access to the 'info' member
of the struct uio_device is protected by spinlock. This is to ensure
stale pointers to data not under control of the UIO subsystem are not
dereferenced.
