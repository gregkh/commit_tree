net/ipv6: Add fib6_lookup

Add IPv6 equivalent to fib_lookup. Does a fib lookup, including rules,
but returns a FIB entry, fib6_info, rather than a dst based rt6_info.
fib6_lookup is any where from 140% (MULTIPLE_TABLES config disabled)
to 60% faster than any of the dst based lookup methods (without custom
rules) and 25% faster with custom rules (e.g., l3mdev rule).

Since the lookup function has a completely different signature,
fib6_rule_action is split into 2 paths: the existing one is
renamed __fib6_rule_action and a new one for the fib6_info path
is added. fib6_rule_action decides which to call based on the
lookup_ptr. If it is fib6_table_lookup then the new path is taken.

Caller must hold rcu lock as no reference is taken on the returned
fib entry.
