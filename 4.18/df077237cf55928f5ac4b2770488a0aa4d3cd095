Input: elantech - detect new ICs and setup Host Notify for them

New ICs are using a different scheme for the alternate bus parameter.
Given that they are new and are only using either PS2 only or PS2 + SMBus
Host Notify, we force those new ICs to use the SMBus solution for enhanced
reporting.

This allows the touchpad found on the Lenovo T480s to report 5 fingers
every 8 ms, instead of having a limit of 2 every 8 ms.
