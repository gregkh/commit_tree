mac80211: ethtool: avoid 32 bit multiplication overflow

The multiplication of 100000 * cfg80211_calculate_bitrate() is a 32 bit
operation and can overflow if cfg80211_calculate_bitrate is greater
than 42949. Although I don't believe this is occurring at present, it
would be safer to avoid the potential overflow by making the constant
100000 an ULL to ensure a 64 multiplication occurs.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1468643 ("Unintentional integer overflow")
