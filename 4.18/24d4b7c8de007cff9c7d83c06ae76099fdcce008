staging: lustre: o2iblnd: Fix FastReg map/unmap for MLX5

The FastReg support in ko2iblnd was not unmapping pool items
causing the items to leak.  In addition, the mapping code
is not growing the pool like we do with FMR.

This patch makes sure we are unmapping FastReg pool elements
when we are done with them.  It also makes sure the pool
will grow when we depleat the pool.
