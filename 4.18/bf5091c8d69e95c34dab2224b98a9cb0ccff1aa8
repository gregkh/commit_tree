btrfs: use kvzalloc for EXTENT_SAME temporary data

The dedupe range is 16 MiB, with 4 KiB pages and 8 byte pointers, the
arrays can be 32KiB large. To avoid allocation failures due to
fragmented memory, use the allocation with fallback to vmalloc.

The arrays are allocated and freed only inside btrfs_extent_same and
reused for all the ranges.
