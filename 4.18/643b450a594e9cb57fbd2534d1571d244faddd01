drm/i915: Only track live rings for retiring

We don't need to track every ring for its lifetime as they are managed
by the contexts/engines. What we do want to track are the live rings so
that we can sporadically clean up requests if userspace falls behind. We
can simply restrict the gt->rings list to being only gt->live_rings.

v2: s/live/active/ for consistency with gt.active_requests
