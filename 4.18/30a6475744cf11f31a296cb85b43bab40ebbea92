i2c: busses: make use of i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg

Because it looks neater.

For diolan, this allows factoring out some code that is now common
between if and else.

For eg20t, pch_i2c_writebytes is always called with a write in
msgs->flags, and pch_i2c_readbytes with a read.

For imx, i2c_imx_dma_write and i2c_imx_write are always called with a
write in msgs->flags, and i2c_imx_read with a read.

For qup, qup_i2c_write_tx_fifo_v1 is always called with a write in
qup->msg->flags.

For stu300, also restructure debug output for resends, since that
code as a result is only handling debug output.
