KVM: arm/arm64: Replace the single rdist region by a list

At the moment KVM supports a single rdist region. We want to
support several separate rdist regions so let's introduce a list
of them. This patch currently only cares about a single
entry in this list as the functionality to register several redist
regions is not yet there. So this only translates the existing code
into something functionally similar using that new data struct.

The redistributor region handle is stored in the vgic_cpu structure
to allow later computation of the TYPER last bit.
