ASoC: sh: Update menu title and platform dependency

Change the menu title to refer to "Renesas SoCs" instead of "SuperH", as
both SuperH and ARM SoCs are supported.

Since commit 9b5ba0df4ea4f940 ("ARM: shmobile: Introduce ARCH_RENESAS")
is ARCH_RENESAS a more appropriate platform dependency for Renesas ARM
SoCs than the legacy ARCH_SHMOBILE, hence use the former.
Renesas SuperH SH-Mobile SoCs are still covered by the SUPERH
dependency.

This will allow to drop ARCH_SHMOBILE on ARM and ARM64 in the near
future.
