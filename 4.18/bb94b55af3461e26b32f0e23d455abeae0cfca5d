vfio: Use get_user_pages_longterm correctly

The patch noted in the fixes below converted get_user_pages_fast() to
get_user_pages_longterm(), however the two calls differ in a few ways.

First _fast() is documented to not require the mmap_sem, while _longterm()
is documented to need it. Hold the mmap sem as required.

Second, _fast accepts an 'int write' while _longterm uses 'unsigned int
gup_flags', so the expression '!!(prot & IOMMU_WRITE)' is only working by
luck as FOLL_WRITE is currently == 0x1. Use the expected FOLL_WRITE
constant instead.
