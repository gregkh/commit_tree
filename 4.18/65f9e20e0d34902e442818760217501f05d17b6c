mmc: block: Don't switch to the same partition type in mmc_blk_remove()

It's pointless to switch and trace partition type if the current
selected device partition is the same with that one. Moreover, cycled
claiming host associated with mmc_blk_part_switch() could make
mmc_blk_remove() end up waiting for grabbing the context if it's
occupied, which lead requests could still hit the low-level drivers,
if an asynchronous unbind for host drivers happened, as the card hasn't
been set removed in the remove path.

So a simple dd in background:
dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/null bs=512k count=100000 &

and doing unbind then:
echo fe320000.dwmmc > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/dwmmc_rockchip/unbind

could make the console stuck for quite a while depending on the
numbers of requests.
