samples: bpf: move libbpf from object dependencies to libs

Make complains that it doesn't know how to make libbpf.a:

scripts/Makefile.host:106: target 'samples/bpf/../../tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.a' doesn't match the target pattern

Now that we have it as a dependency of the sources simply add libbpf.a
to libraries not objects.
