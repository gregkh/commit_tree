HID: redragon: Fix modifier keys for Redragon Asura Keyboard

This adds a new driver for the Redragon Asura keyboard. The Asura
keyboard contains an error in the HID descriptor which causes all
modifier keys to be mapped to left shift. Additionally, we suppress
the creation of a second, not working, keyboard device.
