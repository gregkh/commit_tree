ipv6/mcast: init as INCLUDE when join SSM INCLUDE group

This an IPv6 version patch of "ipv4/igmp: init group mode as INCLUDE when
join source group". From RFC3810, part 6.1:

   If no per-interface state existed for that
   multicast address before the change (i.e., the change consisted of
   creating a new per-interface record), or if no state exists after the
   change (i.e., the change consisted of deleting a per-interface
   record), then the "non-existent" state is considered to have an
   INCLUDE filter mode and an empty source list.

Which means a new multicast group should start with state IN(). Currently,
for MLDv2 SSM JOIN_SOURCE_GROUP mode, we first call ipv6_sock_mc_join(),
then ip6_mc_source(), which will trigger a TO_IN() message instead of
ALLOW().

The issue was exposed by commit a052517a8ff65 ("net/multicast: should not
send source list records when have filter mode change"). Before this change,
we sent both ALLOW(A) and TO_IN(A). Now, we only send TO_IN(A).

Fix it by adding a new parameter to init group mode. Also add some wrapper
functions to avoid changing too much code.

v1 -> v2:
In the first version I only cleared the group change record. But this is not
enough. Because when a new group join, it will init as EXCLUDE and trigger
a filter mode change in ip/ip6_mc_add_src(), which will clear all source
addresses sf_crcount. This will prevent early joined address sending state
change records if multi source addressed joined at the same time.

In v2 patch, I fixed it by directly initializing the mode to INCLUDE for SSM
JOIN_SOURCE_GROUP. I also split the original patch into two separated patches
for IPv4 and IPv6.

There is also a difference between v4 and v6 version. For IPv6, when the
interface goes down and up, we will send correct state change record with
unspecified IPv6 address (::) with function ipv6_mc_up(). But after DAD is
completed, we resend the change record TO_IN() in mld_send_initial_cr().
Fix it by sending ALLOW() for INCLUDE mode in mld_send_initial_cr().
