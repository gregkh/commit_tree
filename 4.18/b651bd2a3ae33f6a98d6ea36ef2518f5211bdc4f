drm/i915/audio: Fix audio enumeration issue on BXT

On Apollolake, with stress test warm reboot, audio card was not getting
enumerated after reboot. This was a spurious issue happening on
Apollolake. HW codec and HD audio controller link was going out of sync
for which there was a fix in i915 driver but was not getting invoked for
BXT. Extending this fix to BXT as well.

Tested on apollolake chromebook by stress test warm reboot with 2500
iterations.
