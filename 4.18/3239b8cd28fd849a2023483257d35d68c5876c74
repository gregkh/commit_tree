scsi: megaraid_sas: Increase timeout by 1 sec for non-RAID fastpath IOs

Hardware could time out Fastpath IOs one second earlier than the timeout
provided by the host.

For non-RAID devices, driver provides timeout value based on OS provided
timeout value. Under certain scenarios, if the OS provides a timeout
value of 1 second, due to above behavior hardware will timeout
immediately.

Increase timeout value for non-RAID fastpath IOs by 1 second.
