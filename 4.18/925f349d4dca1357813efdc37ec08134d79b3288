xhci: xhci-hub: use port structure members instead of xhci_get_ports()

xhci_get_ports() is one of the last functions using port_arrays in
xhci-hub.c. We get the same data directly from hub and port structures
instead, so convert and remove both xhci_get_ports() and port_arrays from
all function that no longer need it.
