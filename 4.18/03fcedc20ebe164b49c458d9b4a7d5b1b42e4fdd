drivers/staging/fsl-mc: Use devm_memremap/devm_ioremap for DPIO

Change the mapping of the QBMan cache enabled area from using ioremap_wc()
to devm_memremap(). This allows the __iomem attribute to be removed from
the pointer (which makes sense as accesses treat this as cacheable memory
not IO memory).  These changes allow sparse checks to pass.

Also use devm_ioremap() for the cache inhibited area so unmap occurs
automatically when the device is released.
