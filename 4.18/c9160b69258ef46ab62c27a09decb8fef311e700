ntb: ntb_transport: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in ntb_transport_create_queue

ntb_transport_create_queue() is never called in atomic context.

ntb_transport_create_queue() is only called by ntb_netdev_probe(),
which is set as ".probe" in struct ntb_transport_client.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
ntb_transport_create_queue() calls kzalloc_node() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
which can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it
