nvme-rdma: fix possible double free of controller async event buffer

If reconnect/reset failed where the controller async event buffer
was freed, we might end up freeing it again as we call
nvme_rdma_destroy_admin_queue again in the remove path. Given that
the sequence is guaranteed to serialize by .ctrl_stop, we simply
set ctrl->async_event_sqe.data to NULL and don't free it in future
visits.
