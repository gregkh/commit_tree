qed* : Add new TLV to request PF to update MAC in bulletin board

There may be a need for VF driver to request PF to explicitly update its
bulletin with a MAC address.
e.g. When user assigns a MAC address to VF while VF is still down,
and PF's bulletin board contains different MAC address, in this case,
when VF's interface is brought up, it gets loaded with MAC address from
bulletin board which is not desirable.

To handle this corner case, we need a new TLV to request PF to update
its bulletin board with suggested MAC.

This request will be honored only for trusted VFs.
