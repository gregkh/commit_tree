kbuild: remove CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE support

Kbuild provides a couple of ways to specify CROSS_COMPILE:

[1] Command line
[2] Environment
[3] arch/*/Makefile (only some architectures)
[4] CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE

[4] is problematic for the compiler capability tests in Kconfig.
CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE allows users to change the compiler prefix from
'make menuconfig', etc.  It means, the compiler options would have
to be all re-calculated everytime CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE is changed.

To avoid complexity and performance issues, I'd like to evaluate
the shell commands statically, i.e. only parsing Kconfig files.

I guess the majority is [1] or [2].  Currently, there are only
5 defconfig files that specify CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE.
  arch/arm/configs/lpc18xx_defconfig
  arch/hexagon/configs/comet_defconfig
  arch/nds32/configs/defconfig
  arch/openrisc/configs/or1ksim_defconfig
  arch/openrisc/configs/simple_smp_defconfig
