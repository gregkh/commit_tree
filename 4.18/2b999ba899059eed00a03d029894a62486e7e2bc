net: phy: sfp: handle cases where neither BR, min nor BR, max is given

When computing the bitrate using values read from an SFP module EEPROM,
we use the nominal BR plus BR,min and BR,max to determine the
boundaries. But in some cases BR,min and BR,max aren't provided, which
led the SFP code to end up having the nominal value for both the minimum
and maximum bitrate values. When using a passive cable, the nominal
value should be used as the maximum one, and there is no minimum one
so we should use 0.
