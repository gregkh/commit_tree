kconfig: support simply expanded variable

The previous commit added variable and user-defined function.  They
work similarly in the sense that the evaluation is deferred until
they are used.

This commit adds another type of variable, simply expanded variable,
as we see in Make.

The := operator defines a simply expanded variable, expanding the
righthand side immediately.  This works like traditional programming
language variables.
