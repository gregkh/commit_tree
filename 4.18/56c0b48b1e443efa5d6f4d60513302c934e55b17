powerpc/powernv: process all OPAL event interrupts with kopald

Using irq_work for processing OPAL event interrupts is not necessary.
irq_work is typically used to schedule work from NMI context, a
softirq may be more appropriate. However OPAL events are not
particularly performance or latency critical, so they can all be
invoked by kopald.

This patch removes the irq_work queueing, and instead wakes up
kopald when there is an event to be processed. kopald processes
interrupts individually, enabling irqs and calling cond_resched
between each one to minimise latencies.

Event handlers themselves should still use threaded handlers,
workqueues, etc. as necessary to avoid high interrupts-off latencies
within any single interrupt.
