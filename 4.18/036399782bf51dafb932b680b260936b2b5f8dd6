cpufreq: Rename cpufreq_can_do_remote_dvfs()

This routine checks if the CPU running this code belongs to the policy
of the target CPU or if not, can it do remote DVFS for it remotely. But
the current name of it implies as if it is only about doing remote
updates.

Rename it to make it more relevant.
