crypto: testmgr - add extra kw(aes) encryption test vector

One "kw(aes)" decryption test vector doesn't exactly match an encryption
test vector with input and result swapped.  In preparation for removing
the decryption test vectors, add this test vector to the encryption test
vectors, so we don't lose any test coverage.
