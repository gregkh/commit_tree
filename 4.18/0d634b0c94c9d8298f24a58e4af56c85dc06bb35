sctp: factor out sctp_outq_select_transport

We had two spots doing such complex operation and they were very close to
each other, a bit more tailored to here or there.

This patch unifies these under the same function,
sctp_outq_select_transport, which knows how to handle control chunks and
original transmissions (but not retransmissions).
