netfilter: nf_tables: add destroy_clone expression

Before this patch, cloned expressions are released via ->destroy. This
is a problem for the new connlimit expression since the ->destroy path
drop a reference on the conntrack modules and it unregisters hooks. The
new ->destroy_clone provides context that this expression is being
released from the packet path, so it is mirroring ->clone(), where
neither module reference is dropped nor hooks need to be unregistered -
because this done from the control plane path from the ->init() path.
