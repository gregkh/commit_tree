bpf: btf: Add struct bpf_btf_info

During BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD on a btf_fd, the current bpf_attr's
info.info is directly filled with the BTF binary data.  It is
not extensible.  In this case, we want to add BTF ID.

This patch adds "struct bpf_btf_info" which has the BTF ID as
one of its member.  The BTF binary data itself is exposed through
the "btf" and "btf_size" members.
