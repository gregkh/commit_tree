nfp: bpf: rewrite map pointers with NFP TIDs

Kernel will now replace map fds with actual pointer before
calling the offload prepare.  We can identify those pointers
and replace them with NFP table IDs instead of loading the
table ID in code generated for CALL instruction.

This allows us to support having the same CALL being used with
different maps.

Since we don't want to change the FW ABI we still need to
move the TID from R1 to portion of R0 before the jump.
