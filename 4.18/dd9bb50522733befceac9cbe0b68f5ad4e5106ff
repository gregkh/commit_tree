staging: bcm2835-camera: Skip ISP pass to eliminate padding.

Interleaved RGB and single plane YUV formats can be delivered by the
GPU without the secondary step of removing padding, as the
bytesperline field can be set appropriately.

Planar YUV needs the GPU to still remove padding, as there is no way
to report that there is padding between the planes (ie on the height).
The multi-planar formats are NOT applicable, as there is no easy way
to make them contiguous in memory (ie one large allocation that gets
broken up). The whole task is passed across to videobuf2 which has no
notion of that requirement.

v2: Changes by anholt from the downstream driver: Flag two more planar
    formats as needing padding removal, and remove broken userspace
    workaround.
