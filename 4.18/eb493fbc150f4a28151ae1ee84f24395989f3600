drm/nouveau: Set DRIVER_ATOMIC cap earlier to fix debugfs

Currently nouveau doesn't actually expose the state debugfs file that's
usually provided for any modesetting driver that supports atomic, even
if nouveau is loaded with atomic=1. This is due to the fact that the
standard debugfs files that DRM creates for atomic drivers is called
when drm_get_pci_dev() is called from nouveau_drm.c. This happens well
before we've initialized the display core, which is currently
responsible for setting the DRIVER_ATOMIC cap.

So, move the atomic option into nouveau_drm.c and just add the
DRIVER_ATOMIC cap whenever it's enabled on the kernel commandline. This
shouldn't cause any actual issues, as the atomic ioctl will still fail
as expected even if the display core doesn't disable it until later in
the init sequence. This also provides the added benefit of being able to
use the state debugfs file to check the current display state even if
clients aren't allowed to modify it through anything other than the
legacy ioctls.

Additionally, disable the DRIVER_ATOMIC cap in nv04's display core, as
this was already disabled there previously.
