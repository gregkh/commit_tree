drm/nouveau: Remove bogus crtc check in pmops_runtime_idle

This both uses the legacy modesetting structures in a racy manner, and
additionally also doesn't even check the right variable (enabled != the
CRTC is actually turned on for atomic).

This fixes issues on my P50 regarding the dedicated GPU not entering
runtime suspend.
