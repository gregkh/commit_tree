xfs: clean up locking in xfs_file_iomap_begin

Rather than checking what kind of locking is needed in a helper
function and then jumping through hoops to do the locking in line,
move the locking to the helper function that does all the checks
and rename it to xfs_ilock_for_iomap().

This also allows us to hoist all the nonblocking checks up into the
locking helper, further simplifier the code flow in
xfs_file_iomap_begin() and making it easier to understand.
