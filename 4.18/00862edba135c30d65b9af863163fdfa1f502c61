drm/ttm: Use GFP_TRANSHUGE_LIGHT for allocating huge pages

GFP_TRANSHUGE tries very hard to allocate huge pages, which can result
in long delays with high memory pressure. I have observed firefox
freezing for up to around a minute due to this while restic was taking
a full system backup.

Since we don't really need huge pages, use GFP_TRANSHUGE_LIGHT |
__GFP_NORETRY instead, in order to fail quickly when there are no huge
pages available.

Set __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM as well, in order for huge pages to be freed
up in the background if necessary.

With these changes, I'm no longer seeing freezes during a restic backup.
