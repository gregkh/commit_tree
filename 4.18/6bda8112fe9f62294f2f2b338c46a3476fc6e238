drm/rockchip: pre dither down when output bpc is 8bit

Some encoder have a crc verification check, crc check fail if
input and output data is not equal.

That means encoder input and output need use same color depth,
vop can output 10bit data to encoder, but some panel only support
8bit depth, that would make crc check die.

So pre dither down vop data to 8bit if panel's bpc is 8.
