ath10k: re-enable the firmware fallback mechanism for testmode

The ath10k testmode uses request_firmware_direct() in order to avoid
producing firmware load warnings. Disabling the fallback mechanism was a
side effect of disabling warnings.

We now have a new API that allows us to avoid warnings while keeping the
fallback mechanism enabled. So use that instead.
