net: hns3: Adds support for led locate command for copper port

Firmware now supports control of all leds. Existing HNS3 driver code
only supported led locate command over SFP Fibre ports. But now it
is also supported over copper port.
This patch removes existing not needed code for the led locate
command and updates the led control command between driver and
firmware.
