spi: spi-s3c64xx: Allow higher transfer lengths in polling IO mode

Some variants of the SPI controller have no DMA support, in such case
SPI transfers longer than the FIFO length are not currently properly
handled by the driver. Fix it by doing multiple transfers in the
s3c64xx_spi_transfer_one() function if the SPI transfer length exceeds
the FIFO size.
