pinctrl: mt7622: stop using the deprecated pinctrl_add_gpio_range

If the pinctrl node has the gpio-ranges property, the range will be added
by the gpio core and doesn't need to be added by the pinctrl driver.

But for keeping backward compatibility, an explicit pinctrl_add_gpio_range
is still needed to be called when there is a missing gpio-ranges in pinctrl
node in old dts files.
