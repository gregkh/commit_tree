spi: Expose spi_{map,unmap}_buf() for internal use

spi_{map,unmap}_buf() are needed by the spi-mem logic that is about to
be introduced to prepare data buffer for DMA operations.

Remove the static specifier on these functions and add their prototypes
to drivers/spi/internals.h. We do not export the symbols here because
both SPI_MEM and SPI can't be enabled as modules and we'd like to
prevent controller/device drivers from using these functions.
