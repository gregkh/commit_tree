regulator: arizona-ldo1: Look up a descriptor and pass to the core

Instead of passing a global GPIO number, pass a descriptor looked
up with the standard devm_gpiod_get_optional() call.

We have augmented the GPIO core to look up the regulator special
GPIO "wlf,ldoena" in commit 6a537d48461d
"gpio: of: Support regulator nonstandard GPIO properties".
