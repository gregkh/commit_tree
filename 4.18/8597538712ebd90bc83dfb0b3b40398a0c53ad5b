powerpc/fadump: Do not use hugepages when fadump is active

FADump capture kernel boots in restricted memory environment preserving
the context of previous kernel to save vmcore. Supporting hugepages in
such environment makes things unnecessarily complicated, as hugepages
need memory set aside for them. This means most of the capture kernel's
memory is used in supporting hugepages. In most cases, this results in
out-of-memory issues while booting FADump capture kernel. But hugepages
are not of much use in capture kernel whose only job is to save vmcore.
So, disabling hugepages support, when fadump is active, is a reliable
solution for the out of memory issues. Introducing a flag variable to
disable HugeTLB support when fadump is active.
