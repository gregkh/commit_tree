gpu: drm: bridge: adv7511: Replace mdelay with usleep_range in adv7511_probe

adv7511_probe() is never called in atomic context.
This function is only set as ".probe" in struct i2c_driver.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, adv7511_probe()
calls mdelay() to busily wait.
This is not necessary and can be replaced with usleep_range() to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
