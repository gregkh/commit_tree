cgroup: Rename stat to rstat

stat is too generic a name and ends up causing subtle confusions.
It'll be made generic so that controllers can plug into it, which will
make the problem worse.  Let's rename it to something more specific -
cgroup_rstat for cgroup recursive stat.

This patch does the following renames.  No other changes.

* cpu_stat	-> rstat_cpu
* stat		-> rstat
* ?cstat	-> ?rstatc

Note that the renames are selective.  The unrenamed are the ones which
implement basic resource statistics on top of rstat.  This will be
further cleaned up in the following patches.
