udp: Do not pass checksum as a parameter to GSO segmentation

This patch is meant to allow us to avoid having to recompute the checksum
from scratch and have it passed as a parameter.

Instead of taking that approach we can take advantage of the fact that the
length that was used to compute the existing checksum is included in the
UDP header.

Finally to avoid the need to invert the result we can just call csum16_add
and csum16_sub directly. By doing this we can avoid a number of
instructions in the loop that is handling segmentation.
