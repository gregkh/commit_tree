printk: wake up klogd in vprintk_emit

We wake up klogd very late - only when current console_sem owner
is done pushing pending kernel messages to the serial/net consoles.
In some cases this results in lost syslog messages, because kernel
log buffer is a circular buffer and if we don't wakeup syslog long
enough there are chances that logbuf simply will wrap around.

The patch moves the klogd wake up call to vprintk_emit(), which is
the only legit way for a kernel message to appear in the logbuf,
right after the attempt to handle consoles. As a result, klogd
will get waken either after flushing the new message to consoles
or immediately when consoles are still busy with older messages.
