cgroup: Make cgroup_rstat_updated() ready for root cgroup usage

cgroup_rstat_updated() ensures that the cgroup's rstat is linked to
the parent.  If there's no parent, it never gets linked and the
function ends up grabbing and releasing the cgroup_rstat_lock each
time for no reason which can be expensive.

This hasn't been a problem till now because nobody was calling the
function for the root cgroup but rstat is gonna be exposed to
controllers and use cases, so let's get ready.  Make
cgroup_rstat_updated() an no-op for the root cgroup.
