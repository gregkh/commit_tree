batman-adv: Fix debugfs path for renamed hardif

batman-adv is creating special debugfs directories in the init
net_namespace for each valid hard-interface (net_device). But it is
possible to rename a net_device to a completely different name then the
original one.

It can therefore happen that a user registers a new net_device which gets
the name "wlan0" assigned by default. batman-adv is also adding a new
directory under $debugfs/batman-adv/ with the name "wlan0".

The user then decides to rename this device to "wl_pri" and registers a
different device. The kernel may now decide to use the name "wlan0" again
for this new device. batman-adv will detect it as a valid net_device and
tries to create a directory with the name "wlan0" under
$debugfs/batman-adv/. But there already exists one with this name under
this path and thus this fails. batman-adv will detect a problem and
rollback the registering of this device.

batman-adv must therefore take care of renaming the debugfs directories
for hard-interfaces whenever it detects such a net_device rename.
