zram: mark incompressible page as ZRAM_HUGE

Mark incompressible pages so that we could investigate who is the owner
of the incompressible pages once the page is swapped out via using
upcoming zram memory tracker feature.

With it, we could prevent such pages to be swapped out by using mlock.
Otherwise we might remove them.

This patch exposes new stat for huge pages via mm_stat.
