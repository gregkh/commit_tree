pnfs: Don't release the sequence slot until we've processed layoutget on open

If the server recalls the layout that was just handed out, we risk hitting
a race as described in RFC5661 Section 2.10.6.3 unless we ensure that we
release the sequence slot after processing the LAYOUTGET operation that
was sent as part of the OPEN compound.
