staging: emxx_udc: Change platform dependency to ARCH_RENESAS

Emma Mobile is a Renesas ARM SoC.  Since commit 9b5ba0df4ea4f940 ("ARM:
shmobile: Introduce ARCH_RENESAS") is ARCH_RENESAS a more appropriate
platform dependency than the legacy ARCH_SHMOBILE, hence use the
former.

This will allow to drop ARCH_SHMOBILE on ARM in the near future.
