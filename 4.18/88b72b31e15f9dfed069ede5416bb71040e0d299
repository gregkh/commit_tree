proc: Consolidate task->comm formatting into proc_task_name()

proc shows task->comm in three places - comm, stat, status - and each
is fetching and formatting task->comm slighly differently.  This patch
renames task_name() to proc_task_name(), makes it more generic, and
updates all three paths to use it.

This will enable expanding comm reporting for workqueue workers.
