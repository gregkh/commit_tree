media: rcar-vin: unregister video device on driver removal

If the video device was registered by the complete() callback it should
be unregistered when a device is unbound from the driver. Protect from
printing an uninitialized video device node name by adding a check in
rvin_v4l2_unregister() to identify that the video device is registered.
