pinctrl: single: Add allocation failure checking of saved_vals

Currently saved_vals is being allocated and there is no check for
failed allocation (which is more likely than normal when using
GFP_ATOMIC).  Fix this by checking for a failed allocation and
propagating this error return down the the caller chain.
