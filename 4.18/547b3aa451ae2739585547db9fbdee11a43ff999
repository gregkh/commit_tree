bpf: sockmap, error path can not release psock in multi-map case

The current code, in the error path of sock_hash_ctx_update_elem,
checks if the sock has a psock in the user data and if so decrements
the reference count of the psock. However, if the error happens early
in the error path we may have never incremented the psock reference
count and if the psock exists because the sock is in another map then
we may inadvertently decrement the reference count.

Fix this by making the error path only call smap_release_sock if the
error happens after the increment.
