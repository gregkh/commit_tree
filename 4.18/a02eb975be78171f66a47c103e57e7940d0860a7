drm/i915/execlists: Cache the priolist when rescheduling

When rescheduling a change of dependencies, they all need to be added to
the same priolist (at least the ones on the same engine!). Since we
likely want to move a batch of requests, keep the priolist around.

v2: Throw in an assert to catch trivial errors quickly.
