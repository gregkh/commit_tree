ip6_tunnel: use the right value for ipv4 min mtu check in ip6_tnl_xmit

According to RFC791, 68 bytes is the minimum size of IPv4 datagram every
device must be able to forward without further fragmentation while 576
bytes is the minimum size of IPv4 datagram every device has to be able
to receive, so in ip6_tnl_xmit(), 68(IPV4_MIN_MTU) should be the right
value for the ipv4 min mtu check in ip6_tnl_xmit.

While at it, change to use max() instead of if statement.
