btrfs: take the last remnants of ->d_fsdata use out

[spotted while going through ->d_fsdata handling around d_splice_alias();
don't really care which tree that goes through]

The only thing even looking at ->d_fsdata in there (since 2012)
had been kfree(dentry->d_fsdata) in btrfs_dentry_delete().  Which,
incidentally, is all btrfs_dentry_delete() does.
