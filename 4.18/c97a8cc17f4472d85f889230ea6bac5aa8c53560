typec: tcpm: Provide fwnode pointer as part of psy_cfg

For supply registration, provide fwnode pointer of the port device,
via the power_supply_config structure, to allow other psy drivers
to add us as a supplier. At present this only applies to DT
based platforms using the 'power-supplies' DT property, but in the
future should also work for ACPI platforms when the relevant support
is added to the power_supply core.
