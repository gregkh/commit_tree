brcmfmac: validate user provided data for memdump before copying

In patch "brcmfmac: add support for sysfs initiated coredump", a new
scenario of brcmf_debug_create_memdump was added in which the user of
the function might not necessarily provide prefix data. Hence the
function should not assume the data is always valid and should perform a
check before copying.
