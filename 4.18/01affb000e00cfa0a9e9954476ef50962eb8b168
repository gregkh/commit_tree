media: em28xx: Fix DualHD broken second tuner

The use of a hard coded i2c address breaks the creation of the
second tuner in DualHD 01595 models. The issue is compounded
by lack of any error message stating that a driver failed
initialization. Use addr, which contains the correct address
for each tuner.
