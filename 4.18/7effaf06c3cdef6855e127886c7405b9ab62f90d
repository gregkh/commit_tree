net: rollback orig value on failure of dev_qdisc_change_tx_queue_len

Fix dev_change_tx_queue_len so it rolls back original value
upon a failure in dev_qdisc_change_tx_queue_len.
This is already done for notifirers' failures, share the code.

In case of failure in dev_qdisc_change_tx_queue_len, some tx queues
would still be of the new length, while they should be reverted.
Currently, the revert is not done, and is marked with a TODO label
in dev_qdisc_change_tx_queue_len, and should find some nice solution
to do it.
Yet it is still better to not apply the newly requested value.
