net/smc: fix up merge error with poll changes

My networking merge (commit 4e33d7d47943: "Pull networking fixes from
David Miller") got the poll() handling conflict wrong for af_smc.

The conflict between my a11e1d432b51 ("Revert changes to convert to
->poll_mask() and aio IOCB_CMD_POLL") and Ursula Braun's 24ac3a08e658
("net/smc: rebuild nonblocking connect") should have left the call to
sock_poll_wait() in place, just without the socket lock release/retake.

And I really should have realized that.  But happily, I at least asked
Ursula to double-check the merge, and she set me right.

This also fixes an incidental whitespace issue nearby that annoyed me
while looking at this.
