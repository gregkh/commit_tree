l2tp: reject creation of non-PPP sessions on L2TPv2 tunnels

The /proc/net/pppol2tp handlers (pppol2tp_seq_*()) iterate over all
L2TPv2 tunnels, and rightfully expect that only PPP sessions can be
found there. However, l2tp_netlink accepts creating Ethernet sessions
regardless of the underlying tunnel version.

This confuses pppol2tp_seq_session_show(), which expects that
l2tp_session_priv() returns a pppol2tp_session structure. When the
session is an Ethernet pseudo-wire, a struct l2tp_eth_sess is returned
instead. This leads to invalid memory access when
pppol2tp_session_get_sock() later tries to dereference ps->sk.
