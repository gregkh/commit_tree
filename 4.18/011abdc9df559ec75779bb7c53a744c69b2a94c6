md: fix two problems with setting the "re-add" device state.

If "re-add" is written to the "state" file for a device
which is faulty, this has an effect similar to removing
and re-adding the device.  It should take up the
same slot in the array that it previously had, and
an accelerated (e.g. bitmap-based) rebuild should happen.

The slot that "it previously had" is determined by
rdev->saved_raid_disk.
However this is not set when a device fails (only when a device
is added), and it is cleared when resync completes.
This means that "re-add" will normally work once, but may not work a
second time.

This patch includes two fixes.
1/ when a device fails, record the ->raid_disk value in
    ->saved_raid_disk before clearing ->raid_disk
2/ when "re-add" is written to a device for which
    ->saved_raid_disk is not set, fail.

I think this is suitable for stable as it can
cause re-adding a device to be forced to do a full
resync which takes a lot longer and so puts data at
more risk.
