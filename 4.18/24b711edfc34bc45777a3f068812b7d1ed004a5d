net/ipv6: Fix linklocal to global address with VRF

Example setup:
    host: ip -6 addr add dev eth1 2001:db8:104::4
           where eth1 is enslaved to a VRF

    switch: ip -6 ro add 2001:db8:104::4/128 dev br1
            where br1 only has an LLA

           ping6 2001:db8:104::4
           ssh   2001:db8:104::4

(NOTE: UDP works fine if the PKTINFO has the address set to the global
address and ifindex is set to the index of eth1 with a destination an
LLA).

For ICMP, icmp6_iif needs to be updated to check if skb->dev is an
L3 master. If it is then return the ifindex from rt6i_idev similar
to what is done for loopback.

For TCP, restore the original tcp_v6_iif definition which is needed in
most places and add a new tcp_v6_iif_l3_slave that considers the
l3_slave variability. This latter check is only needed for socket
lookups.
