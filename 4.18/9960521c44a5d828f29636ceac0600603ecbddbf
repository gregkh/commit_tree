Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix "Sleep inside atomic section" warning

This patch fixes the following warning during boot:

 do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=1 set at
 [<(ptrval)>] qca_setup+0x194/0x750 [hci_uart]
 WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 1878 at kernel/sched/core.c:6135
 __might_sleep+0x7c/0x88

In qca_set_baudrate(), the current task state is set to
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE before going to sleep for 300ms. It was then
restored to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. This patch sets the current task state
back to TASK_RUNNING instead.
