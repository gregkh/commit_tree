HID: rmi: use HID_QUIRK_NO_INPUT_SYNC

When we receive a RMI4 report, we should not unconditionally send an
input_sync event. Instead, we should let the rmi4 transport layer do it
for us.

This fixes a situation where we might receive X in a report and the rest
in a subsequent one. And this messes up user space.
