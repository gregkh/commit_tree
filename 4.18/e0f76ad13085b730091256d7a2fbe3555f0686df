scsi: cxlflash: Yield to active send threads

The following Oops may be encountered if the device is reset, i.e. EEH
recovery, while there is heavy I/O traffic:

When there is no room to send the I/O request, the cached room is refreshed
by reading the memory mapped command room value from the AFU. The AFU
register mapping is refreshed during a reset, creating a race condition that
can lead to the Oops above.

During a device reset, the AFU should not be unmapped until all the active
send threads quiesce. An atomic counter, cmds_active, is currently used to
track internal AFU commands and quiesce during reset. This same counter can
also be used for the active send threads.
