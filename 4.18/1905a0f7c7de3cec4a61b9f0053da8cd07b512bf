btrfs: rename btrfs_mask_flags to reflect which flags it touches

The FS_*_FL flags cannot be easily identified by a variable name prefix
but we still need to recognize them so the 'fsflags' should be closer to
the naming scheme but again the 'fs' part sounds like it's a filesystem
flag. I don't have a better idea for now.
