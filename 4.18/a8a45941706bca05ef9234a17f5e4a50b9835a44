block: pass struct request instead of struct blk_issue_stat to wbt

issue_stat is going to go away, so first make writeback throttling take
the containing request, update the internal wbt helpers accordingly, and
change rwb->sync_cookie to be the request pointer instead of the
issue_stat pointer. No functional change.
