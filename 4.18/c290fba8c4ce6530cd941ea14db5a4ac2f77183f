net/9p/client.c: put refcount of trans_mod in error case in parse_opts()

In my testing, the second mount will fail after umounting successfully.
The reason is that we put refcount of trans_mod in the correct case
rather than the error case in parse_opts() at last.  That will cause the
refcount decrease to -1, and when we try to get trans_mod again in
try_module_get(), we could only increase refcount to 0 which will cause
failure as follows:

parse_opts
  v9fs_get_trans_by_name
    try_module_get : return NULL to caller which cause error

So we should put refcount of trans_mod in error case.
