ASoC: Intel: Disable SND_SOC_INTEL_BAYTRAIL when SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM is enabled

The sound/soc/intel/common/sst-acpi.c code only tries to load the
"baytrail-pcm-audio" driver (and supporting board drivers) when
SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM is not enabled, since otherwise these
are handled by snd-soc-sst-atom-hifi2-platform.ko.

Since these thus will never be used when SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM is
enabled, building these drivers when it is enabled is useless.

Add a Kconfig dependency to reflect this, so that SND_SOC_INTEL_BAYTRAIL
cannot be enabled when SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM is also enabled.
