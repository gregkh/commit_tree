tracing: Fix possible double free in event_enable_trigger_func()

There was a case that triggered a double free in event_trigger_callback()
due to the called reg() function freeing the trigger_data and then it
getting freed again by the error return by the caller. The solution there
was to up the trigger_data ref count.

Code inspection found that event_enable_trigger_func() has the same issue,
but is not as easy to trigger (requires harder to trigger failures). It
needs to be solved slightly different as it needs more to clean up when the
reg() function fails.
