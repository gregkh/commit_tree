drm/amd/pp: Adding a function to store cc6 data in SMU10

Filling the smu10_store_cc6_data based on the implementation
of Windows Powerplay.

There is an uncertainty with one of the parameters passed to the function
pstate_switch_disable - is not a part of smu10 private data structure.
So in the function its just ignored.
