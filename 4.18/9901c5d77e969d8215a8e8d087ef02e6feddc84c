bpf: sockmap, fix crash when ipv6 sock is added

This fixes a crash where we assign tcp_prot to IPv6 sockets instead
of tcpv6_prot.

Previously we overwrote the sk->prot field with tcp_prot even in the
AF_INET6 case. This patch ensures the correct tcp_prot and tcpv6_prot
are used.

Tested with 'netserver -6' and 'netperf -H [IPv6]' as well as
'netperf -H [IPv4]'. The ESTABLISHED check resolves the previously
crashing case here.
