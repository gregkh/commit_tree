dma-mapping: move dma configuration to bus infrastructure

ACPI/OF support for configuration of DMA is a bus specific aspect, and
thus should be configured by the bus.  Introduces a 'dma_configure' bus
method so that busses can control their DMA capabilities.

Also update the PCI, Platform, ACPI and host1x buses to use the new
method.
