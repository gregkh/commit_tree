IB/hfi1: Reorder incorrect send context disable

User send context integrity bits are cleared before the context is
disabled.  If the send context is still processing data, any packets
that need those integrity bits will cause an error and halt the send
context.

During the disable handling, the driver waits for the context to drain.
If the context is halted, the driver will eventually timeout because
the context won't drain and then incorrectly bounce the link.

Reorder the bit clearing and the context disable.

Examine the software state and send context status as well as the
egress status to determine if a send context is in the halted state.

Promote the check macros to static functions for consistency with the
new check and to follow kernel style.

Remove an unused define that refers to the egress timeout.
