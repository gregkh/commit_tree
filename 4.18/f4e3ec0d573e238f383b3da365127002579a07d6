bpf: replace map pointer loads before calling into offloads

Offloads may find host map pointers more useful than map fds.
Map pointers can be used to identify the map, while fds are
only valid within the context of loading process.

Jump to skip_full_check on error in case verifier log overflow
has to be handled (replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr() prints to the
log, driver prep may do that too in the future).
