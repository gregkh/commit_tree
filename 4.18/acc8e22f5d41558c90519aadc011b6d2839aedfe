dt-bindings: mfd: stm32-timers: Add support for dmas

Add support for DMAs to STM32 timers. STM32 Timers can support up to 7
dma requests: up to 4 channels, update, compare and trigger.
DMAs may be used to transfer data from pwm capture for instance.
DMA support is made optional, PWM capture support is also an option.
This is much more wise system-wide to avoid shortage on DMA request
lines as there's significant amount of timer instances that can
request up to 7 channels.
