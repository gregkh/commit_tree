ixgbe/fm10k: Only support macvlan offload for types that support destination filtering

Both the ixgbe and fm10k drivers support destination filtering.

Instead of adding a ton of complexity to support either source or passthru
mode we can instead just avoid offloading them for now. Doing this we avoid
leaking packets into interfaces that aren't meant to receive them.
