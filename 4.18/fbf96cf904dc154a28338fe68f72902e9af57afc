x86/MCE/AMD: Read MCx_MISC block addresses on any CPU

We used rdmsr_safe_on_cpu() to make sure we're reading the proper CPU's
MISC block addresses. However, that caused trouble with CPU hotplug due to
the _on_cpu() helper issuing an IPI while IRQs are disabled.

But we don't have to do that: the block addresses are the same on any CPU
so we can read them on any CPU. (What practically happens is, we read them
on the BSP and cache them, and for later reads, we service them from the
cache).
