drm/i915: Move i915_gpu_error into its own header

Error state management code was moved into separate .c unit
but we didn't move related definitions into own header.

v2: move also intel_display_error_state forward decl
    fix ("Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'")
    warnings detected by checkpatch in moved code (Michal)
