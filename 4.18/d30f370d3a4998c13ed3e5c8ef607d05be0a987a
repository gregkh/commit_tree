x86/kvm/Kconfig: Ensure CRYPTO_DEV_CCP_DD state at minimum matches KVM_AMD

Prevent a config where KVM_AMD=y and CRYPTO_DEV_CCP_DD=m thereby ensuring
that AMD Secure Processor device driver will be built-in when KVM_AMD is
also built-in.

v1->v2:
* Removed usage of 'imply' Kconfig option.
* Change patch commit message.

Fixes: 505c9e94d832 ("KVM: x86: prefer "depends on" to "select" for SEV")
