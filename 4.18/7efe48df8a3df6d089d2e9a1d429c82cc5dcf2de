vmcore: append device dumps to vmcore as elf notes

Update read and mmap logic to append device dumps as additional notes
before the other elf notes. We add device dumps before other elf notes
because the other elf notes may not fill the elf notes buffer
completely and we will end up with zero-filled data between the elf
notes and the device dumps. Tools will then try to decode this
zero-filled data as valid notes and we don't want that. Hence, adding
device dumps before the other elf notes ensure that zero-filled data
can be avoided. This also ensures that the device dumps and the
other elf notes can be properly mmaped at page aligned address.

Incorporate device dump size into the total vmcore size. Also update
offsets for other program headers after the device dumps are added.
