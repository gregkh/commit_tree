iio: adc: ad7791: remove sample freq sysfs attributes

In the current state, these attributes are broken, because they are
registered already, and the kernel throws a warning.
The first registration happens via the `IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ` flag from
the `ad_sigma_delta` driver.

In this commit these attrs are removed, and in the following the
IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ behavior will be implemented, which replaces these
hooks.

This is done to make things a bit easier to review as there is a bit of
overlap in the patch if it's done all at once.
