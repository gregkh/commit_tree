regulator: ltc3676: Assure PGOOD mask is set before changing voltage

Make sure the DVBxB bit 5, PGOOD mask, is set before changing voltage
on the buck converters. If the PGOOD mask bit is not set, the PMIC may
deassert the PGOOD signal during the voltage transition.

On systems that use the PGOOD signal as a power OK indication for the
board or SoC, which should be the case on correct designs, deasserting
the PGOOD signal will lead to system reset or shutdown, which is not
the expected behavior when changing PMIC buck converter voltage.
