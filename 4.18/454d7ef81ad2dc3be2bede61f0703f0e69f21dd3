powerpc/syscalls: Add COMPAT_SPU_NEW() macro

Currently the select system call is wired up with the SYSX_SPU()
macro. The SYSX_SPU() is not handled by systbl_chk.c, which means the
syscall number for select is not checked.

That hides the fact that the syscall number for select is actually
__NR__newselect not __NR_select.

In a following patch we'd like to drop ppc32_select() which means
select will become a regular COMPAT_SYS_SPU() syscall. But
COMPAT_SYS_SPU() can't deal with the fact that the syscall number is
actually __NR__newselect. We also can't just redefine __NR_select
because that's still used for the old select call.

So add a new COMPAT_NEW_SPU() that does the same thing as
COMPAT_SYS_SPU() except it encodes that we're using the new number.
