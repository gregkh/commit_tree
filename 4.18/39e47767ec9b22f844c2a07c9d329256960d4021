rpmsg: Add driver_override device attribute for rpmsg_device

This patch adds "driver_override" device attribute for rpmsg_device which
will allow users to explicitly specify the rpmsg_driver to be used via
sysfs entry.

The "driver_override" device attribute implemented here is very similar
to "driver_override" implemented for platform, pci, and amba bus types.

One important use-case of "driver_override" device attribute is to force
use of rpmsg_chrdev driver for certain rpmsg_device instances.
