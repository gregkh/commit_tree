ASoC: qdsp6: q6routing: Add macros for mixers

All the mixer controls are pretty much same from all the afe ports.

Make these as proper macros for 2 reasons.

1> To avoid any typos in adding new mixer controls for each port.
2> Easy to edit from single place, easy to add new ports

This also prepares the routing driver to accomdate 40 tdm dais.
