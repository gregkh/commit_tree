nvme-pci: queue creation fixes

We've been ignoring NVMe error status on queue creations. Fortunately they
are uncommon, but we should handle these anyway. This patch adds checks
for the a positive error return value that indicates an NVMe status.

If we do see a negative return, the controller isn't usable, so this
patch returns immediately in since we can't unwind that failure.
