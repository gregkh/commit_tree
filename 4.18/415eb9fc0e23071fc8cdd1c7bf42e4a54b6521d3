vfio: platform: Fix using devices in PM Domains

If a device is part of a PM Domain (e.g. power and/or clock domain), its
power state is managed using Runtime PM.  Without Runtime PM, the device
may not be powered up or clocked, causing subtle failures, crashes, or
system lock-ups when the device is accessed by the guest.

Fix this by adding Runtime PM support, powering the device when the VFIO
device is opened by the guest.
