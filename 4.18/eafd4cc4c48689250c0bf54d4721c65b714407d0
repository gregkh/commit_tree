staging: mt7621-mmc: Remove unnecessary setting of dev.platform_data

In the probe function, pdev->dev.platform_data is set to &msdc0_hw,
but the only get access to that is also in the probe function. So that
assignment is removed. The msdc0_hw structure is still available to the
driver as part of the msdc_host structure.
