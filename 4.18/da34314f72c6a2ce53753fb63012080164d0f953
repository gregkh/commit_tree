arm64: dts: fix regulator property name for wlan pcie endpoint

The property name vddpe-supply is not included in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/qcom,pcie.txt
nor in the pcie-qcom PCIe Root Complex driver.

This property name was used in an initial patchset for pcie-qcom,
but was renamed in a later revision.

Therefore, the regulator is currently never enabled, leaving us with
unoperational wlan.

Fix this by using the correct regulator property name, so that wlan
comes up correctly.
