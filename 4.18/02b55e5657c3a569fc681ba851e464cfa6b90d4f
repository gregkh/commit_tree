xdp: add MEM_TYPE_ZERO_COPY

Here, a new type of allocator support is added to the XDP return
API. A zero-copy allocated xdp_buff cannot be converted to an
xdp_frame. Instead is the buff has to be copied. This is not supported
at all in this commit.

Also, an opaque "handle" is added to xdp_buff. This can be used as a
context for the zero-copy allocator implementation.
