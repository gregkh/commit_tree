iwlwifi: mvm: update rs-fw API

Update rs-fw API to match changes in FW.  Specifically, the
TLC_MNG_NOTIF_REQ_CMD command and TLC_MNG_AMSDU_ENABLE_NOTIF
notification are removed, the A-MSDU related info is received from FW
via the TLC_MNG_UPDATE_NOTIF, and the TLC_MNG_CONFIG_CMD uses version
2 of its data structure.

Additionally, constify some arguments in a couple of functions.
