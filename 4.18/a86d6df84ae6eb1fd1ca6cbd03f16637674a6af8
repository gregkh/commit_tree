media: rc: set timeout to smallest value required by enabled protocols

The longer the IR timeout, the longer the rc device waits until delivering
the trailing space. So, by reducing this timeout, we reduce the delay for
the last scancode to be delivered.

Note that the lirc daemon disables all protocols, in which case we revert
back to the default value.
