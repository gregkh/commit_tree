drm/exynos: ipp: Rework checking for the correct buffer formats

Prepare a common function for size and scale checks and call it for
source and destination buffers. Then also move there the state-less checks
from exynos_drm_ipp_task_setup_buffer, so the format information is already
available in limits processing. Finally perform the IPP_LIMIT_BUFFER check
on the real width of the buffer (the width calculated from the provided
buffer pitch).
