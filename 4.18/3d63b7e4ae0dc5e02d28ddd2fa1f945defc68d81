n_tty: Fix stall at n_tty_receive_char_special().

syzbot is reporting stalls at n_tty_receive_char_special() [1]. This is
because comparison is not working as expected since ldata->read_head can
change at any moment. Mitigate this by explicitly masking with buffer size
when checking condition for "while" loops.
