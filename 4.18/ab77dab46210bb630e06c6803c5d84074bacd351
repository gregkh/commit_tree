fs/dax.c: use new return type vm_fault_t

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler.  For now, this is just
documenting that the function returns a VM_FAULT value rather than an
errno.  Once all instances are converted, vm_fault_t will become a
distinct type.

commit 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t")

There was an existing bug inside dax_load_hole() if vm_insert_mixed had
failed to allocate a page table, we'd return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE instead of
VM_FAULT_OOM.  With new vmf_insert_mixed() this issue is addressed.

vm_insert_mixed_mkwrite has inefficiency when it returns an error value,
driver has to convert it to vm_fault_t type.  With new
vmf_insert_mixed_mkwrite() this limitation will be addressed.
