scsi: lpfc: Fix driver not recovering NVME rports during target link faults

During target-side port faults, the driver would not recover all target
port logins. This resulted in a loss of nvme device discovery.

The driver is coded to wait for all GID_FT requests to complete before
restarting discovery. A fault is seen where the outstanding GIT_FT
counts are not properly decremented, thus discovery would never
start. Another fault was found in the clearing of the gidft_inp counter
that would be skipped in this condition. And a third fault found with
lpfc_nvme_register_port that would remove a reverence on the ndlp which
then allows a node swap on a port address change to prematurely remove
the reference and release the ndlp.

The following changes are made:

 - Correct the decrementing of the outstanding GID_FT counters.

 - In RSCN handling, no longer zero the counter before calling to issue
   another GID_FT.

 - No longer remove the reference on the dlp when the ndlp->nrport value
   is not yet null.
