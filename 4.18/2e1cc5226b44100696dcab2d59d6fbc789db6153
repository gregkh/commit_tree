nfp: flower: implement host cmsg handler for LAG

Adds the control message handler to synchronize offloaded group config
with that of the kernel. Such messages are sent from fw to driver and
feature the following 3 flags:

- Data: an attached cmsg could not be processed - store for retransmission
- Xon: FW can accept new messages - retransmit any stored cmsgs
- Sync: full sync requested so retransmit all kernel LAG group info
