dt-bindings: net: dwmac-sun8i: Add binding for GMAC on Allwinner R40 SoC

The Allwinner R40 SoC has the EMAC controller supported by dwmac-sun8i.
It is named "GMAC", while EMAC refers to the 10/100 Mbps Ethernet
controller supported by sun4i-emac. The controller is the same, but
the R40 has the glue layer controls in the clock control unit (CCU),
with a reduced RX delay chain, and no TX delay chain.

This patch adds the R40 specific bits to the dwmac-sun8i binding.
