staging: lustre: llite: cleanup posix acl xattr code

Having an extra ifdef makes the code harder to read. For the case
of ll_xattr_get_common() we have a variable initialized at the
start of the function but it is only used in XATTR_ACL_ACCESS_T
code block. Lets move that variable to that location since its
only used there and make the code look cleaner.
