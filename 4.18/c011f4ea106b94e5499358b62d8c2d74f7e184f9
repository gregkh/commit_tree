KVM: arm/arm64: Check vcpu redist base before registering an iodev

As we are going to register several redist regions,
vgic_register_all_redist_iodevs() may be called several times. We need
to register a redist_iodev for a given vcpu only once. So let's
check if the base address has already been set. Initialize this latter
in kvm_vgic_vcpu_init().
