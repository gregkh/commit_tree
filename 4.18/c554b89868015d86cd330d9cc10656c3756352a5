module: Allow to always show the status of modsign

The sig_enforce parameter could be always shown to reflect the current
status of signature enforcement. For the case of
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE=y, this modification doesn't do anything, since
sig_enforce can only be enabled, and not disabled, even via the kernel
cmdline.
