xfs: don't allow insert-range to shift extents past the maximum offset

Zorro Lang reports that generic/485 blows an assert on a filesystem with
512 byte blocks.  The test tries to fallocate a post-eof extent at the
maximum file size and calls insert range to shift the extents right by
two blocks.  On a 512b block filesystem this causes startoff to overflow
the 54-bit startoff field, leading to the assert.

Therefore, always check the rightmost extent to see if it would overflow
prior to invoking the insert range machinery.
