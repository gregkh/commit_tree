random: convert to ->poll_mask

The big change is that random_read_wait and random_write_wait are merged
into a single waitqueue that uses keyed wakeups.  Because wait_event_*
doesn't know about that this will lead to occassional spurious wakeups
in _random_read and add_hwgenerator_randomness, but wait_event_* is
designed to handle these and were are not in a a hot path there.
