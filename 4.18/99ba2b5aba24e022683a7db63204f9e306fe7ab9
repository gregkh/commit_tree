bpf: sockhash, disallow bpf_tcp_close and update in parallel

After latest lock updates there is no longer anything preventing a
close and recvmsg call running in parallel. Additionally, we can
race update with close if we close a socket and simultaneously update
if via the BPF userspace API (note the cgroup ops are already run
with sock_lock held).

To resolve this take sock_lock in close and update paths.
