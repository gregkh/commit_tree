sched/nohz: Skip remote tick on idle task entirely

Some people have reported that the warning in sched_tick_remote()
occasionally triggers, especially in favour of some RCU-Torture
pressure:

	WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 906 at kernel/sched/core.c:3138 sched_tick_remote+0xb6/0xc0

This happens when the remote tick applies on an idle task. Usually the
idle_cpu() check avoids that, but it is performed before we lock the
runqueue and it is therefore racy. It was intended to be that way in
order to prevent from useless runqueue locks since idle task tick
callback is a no-op.

Now if the racy check slips out of our hands and we end up remotely
ticking an idle task, the empty task_tick_idle() is harmless. Still
it won't pass the WARN_ON_ONCE() test that ensures rq_clock_task() is
not too far from curr->se.exec_start because update_curr_idle() doesn't
update the exec_start value like other scheduler policies. Hence the
reported false positive.

So let's have another check, while the rq is locked, to make sure we
don't remote tick on an idle task. The lockless idle_cpu() still applies
to avoid unecessary rq lock contention.
