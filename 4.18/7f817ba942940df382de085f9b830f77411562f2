PM / core: Use dev_printk() and symbols in suspend/resume diagnostics

When we print diagnostic messages about suspend/resume, we have a device
pointer, so use dev_printk() to match other device-related things.  Add the
function name, similar to initcall_debug output.  E.g.,

  - calling  0000:01:00.0+ @ 998, parent: 0000:00:1c.0
  + pci 0000:01:00.0: calling <something> @ 998, parent: 0000:00:1c.0

I wondered if this would break scripts/bootgraph.pl, but I don't think it
will because bootgraph.pl doesn't add any timing information to $start{}
after it sees "Write protecting the" or "Freeing unused kernel memory".
