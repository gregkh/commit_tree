powerpc/prom: Fix %u/%llx usage since prom_printf() change

In commit eae5f709a4d7 ("powerpc: Add __printf verification to
prom_printf") __printf attribute was added to prom_printf(), which
means GCC started warning about type/format mismatches. As part of
that commit we changed some "%lx" formats to "%llx" where the type is
actually unsigned long long.

Unfortunately prom_printf() doesn't know how to print "%llx", it just
prints a literal "lx", eg:

  reserved memory map:
    lx - lx
    lx - lx

prom_printf() also doesn't know how to print "%u" (only "%lu"), it
just prints a literal "u", eg:

  Max number of cores passed to firmware: u (NR_CPUS = 2048)

Instead of:

  Max number of cores passed to firmware: 2048 (NR_CPUS = 2048)

This commit adds support for the missing formatters.
