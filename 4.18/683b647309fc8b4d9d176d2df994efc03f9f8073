platform/chrome: chromeos_laptop: fix touchpad button mapping on Celes

Celes has newer touch controller (compared to the controllers used in
older BayTrail-based devices) and so uses the same button mapping as
Samus.

This fixes the issue with mouse button being stuck in pressed state
after the first click.
