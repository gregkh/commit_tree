nvme-fabrics: remove unnecessary controller subnqn validation

After creating the nvme controller, nvmf_create_ctrl() validates
the newly created subsysnqn vs the one specified by the options.

In general, this is an unnecessary check as the Connect message
should implicitly ensure this value matches.

With the change to the FC transport to do an asynchronous connect
for the first association create, the transport will return to
nvmf_create_ctrl() before that first association has been established,
thus the subnqn will not yet be set.

Remove the unnecessary validation.
