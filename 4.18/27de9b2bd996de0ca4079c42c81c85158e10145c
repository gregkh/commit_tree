perf evsel: Add has_callchain() helper to make code more compact/clear

Its common to have the (evsel->attr.sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_CALLCHAIN),
so add an evsel__has_callchain(evsel) helper.

This will actually get more uses as we check that instead of
symbol_conf.use_callchain in places where that produces the same result
but makes this decision to be more fine grained, per evsel.
