dma-debug: move initialization to common code

Most mainstream architectures are using 65536 entries, so lets stick to
that.  If someone is really desperate to override it that can still be
done through <asm/dma-mapping.h>, but I'd rather see a really good
rationale for that.

dma_debug_init is now called as a core_initcall, which for many
architectures means much earlier, and provides dma-debug functionality
earlier in the boot process.  This should be safe as it only relies
on the memory allocator already being available.
