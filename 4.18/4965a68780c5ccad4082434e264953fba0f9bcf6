arch: define the ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT config symbol in lib/Kconfig

Define this symbol if the architecture either uses 64-bit pointers or the
PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT is set.  This covers 95% of the old arch magic.  We only
need an additional select for Xen on ARM (why anyway?), and we now always
set ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT on mips boards with 64-bit physical addressing
instead of only doing it when highmem is set.
