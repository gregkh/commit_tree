media: smiapp: fix timeout checking in smiapp_read_nvm

The current code decrements the timeout counter i and the end of
each loop i is incremented, so the check for timeout will always
be false and hence the timeout mechanism is just a dead code path.
Potentially, if the RD_READY bit is not set, we could end up in
an infinite loop.

Fix this so the timeout starts from 1000 and decrements to zero,
if at the end of the loop i is zero we have a timeout condition.
