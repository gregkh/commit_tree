gpio: syscon: allow fetching syscon from parent node

Syscon nodes can be a simple-mfd and the syscon-users then be declared
as children of this node. That way the parent-child structure can be
better represented for devices that are fully embedded in the syscon.

Therefore allow getting the syscon from the parent if neither
a special compatible nor a gpio,syscon-dev property is defined.
