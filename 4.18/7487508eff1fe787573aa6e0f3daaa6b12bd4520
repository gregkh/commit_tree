drm/i915: protect macro parameters in SWING_SEL_{UPP,LO}WER

Protect the macro parameters with parens in order to avoid priority
issues on macro evaluation when the macro argument is not a single
operand.

This is not a problem today, but it could be in the future. I found
this while reviewing a patch that introduces new callers for the
macros.

v2: Rebase.
