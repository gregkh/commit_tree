arm64: cmpwait: Clear event register before arming exclusive monitor

When waiting for a cacheline to change state in cmpwait, we may immediately
wake-up the first time around the outer loop if the event register was
already set (for example, because of the event stream).

Avoid these spurious wakeups by explicitly clearing the event register
before loading the cacheline and setting the exclusive monitor.
