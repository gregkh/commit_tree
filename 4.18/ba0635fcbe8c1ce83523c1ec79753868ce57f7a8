powerpc: Rename thread_struct.fs to addr_limit

It's called 'fs' for historical reasons, it's named after the x86 'FS'
register. But we don't have to use that name for the member of
thread_struct, and in fact arch/x86 doesn't even call it 'fs' anymore.

So rename it to 'addr_limit', which better reflects what it's used
for, and is also the name used on other arches.
