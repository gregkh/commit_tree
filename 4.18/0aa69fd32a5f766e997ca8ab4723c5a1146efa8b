block: add a lower-level bio_add_page interface

For the upcoming removal of buffer heads in XFS we need to keep track of
the number of outstanding writeback requests per page.  For this we need
to know if bio_add_page merged a region with the previous bvec or not.
Instead of adding additional arguments this refactors bio_add_page to
be implemented using three lower level helpers which users like XFS can
use directly if they care about the merge decisions.
