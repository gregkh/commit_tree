qed*: Support drop action classification

With this patch, User can configure for the supported
flows to be dropped. Added a stat "gft_filter_drop"
as well to be populated in ethtool for the dropped flows.

For example -

ethtool -N p5p1 flow-type udp4 dst-port 8000 action -1
ethtool -N p5p1 flow-type tcp4 scr-ip 192.168.8.1 action -1
