arm64: Add 'ssbd' command-line option

On a system where the firmware implements ARCH_WORKAROUND_2,
it may be useful to either permanently enable or disable the
workaround for cases where the user decides that they'd rather
not get a trap overhead, and keep the mitigation permanently
on or off instead of switching it on exception entry/exit.

In any case, default to the mitigation being enabled.
