tipc: fix correct setting of message type in second discoverer

The duplicate address discovery protocol is not safe against two
discoverers running in parallel. The one executing first after the
trial period is over will set the node address and change its own
message type to DSC_REQ_MSG. The one executing last may find that the
node address is already set, and never change message type, with the
result that its links may never be established.

In this commmit we ensure that the message type always is set correctly
after the trial period is over.
