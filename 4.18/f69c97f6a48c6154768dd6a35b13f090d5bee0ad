y2038: parisc: Extend sysvipc data structures

parisc, uses a nonstandard variation of the generic sysvipc
data structures, intended to have the padding moved around
so it can deal with big-endian 32-bit user space that has
64-bit time_t.

Unlike most architectures, parisc actually succeeded in
defining this right for big-endian CPUs, but as everyone else
got it wrong, we just use the same hack everywhere.

This takes just take the same approach here that we have for
the asm-generic headers and adds separate 32-bit fields for the
upper halves of the timestamps, to let libc deal with the mess
in user space.
