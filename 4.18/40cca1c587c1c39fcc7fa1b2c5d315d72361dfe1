net: hns3: Optimize the PF's process of updating multicast MAC

In the current process, the multicast MAC is added to both MAC_VLAN
table and MTA table, this will reduce the utilization of the resource.

This patch improves the process of adding multicast MAC address, the
new process starts using the MTA table to add multicast MAC after the
MAC_VLAN table is full, and the MTA is disable if it is no longer used.
