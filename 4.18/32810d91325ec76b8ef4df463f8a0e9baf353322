powerpc/lib: Fix feature fixup test of external branch

The expected case for this test was wrong, the source of the alternate
code sequence is:

  FTR_SECTION_ELSE
  2:	or	2,2,2
  	PPC_LCMPI	r3,1
  	beq	3f
  	blt	2b
  	b	3f
  	b	1b
  ALT_FTR_SECTION_END(0, 1)
  3:	or	1,1,1
  	or	2,2,2
  4:	or	3,3,3

So when it's patched the '3' label should still be on the 'or 1,1,1',
and the 4 label is irrelevant and can be removed.
