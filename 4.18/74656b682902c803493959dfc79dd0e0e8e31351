kbuild: disable new dtc graph and unit-address warnings

dtc gained some new warnings for OF graphs and unique unit addresses,
but they are currently much too noisy. So turn off
'graph_child_address', 'graph_port', and 'unique_unit_address' warnings
by default. They can be enabled by building dtbs with W=1.
