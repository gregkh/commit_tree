lan78xx: Read LED states from Device Tree

Add support for DT property "microchip,led-modes", a vector of zero
to four cells (u32s) in the range 0-15, each of which sets the mode
for one of the LEDs. Some possible values are:

    0=link/activity          1=link1000/activity
    2=link100/activity       3=link10/activity
    4=link100/1000/activity  5=link10/1000/activity
    6=link10/100/activity    14=off    15=on

These values are given symbolic constants in a dt-bindings header.

Also use the presence of the DT property to indicate that the
LEDs should be enabled - necessary in the event that no valid OTP
or EEPROM is available.
