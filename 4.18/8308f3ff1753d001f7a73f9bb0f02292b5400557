net/ipv6: Add support for specifying metric of connected routes

Add support for IFA_RT_PRIORITY to ipv6 addresses.

If the metric is changed on an existing address then the new route
is inserted before removing the old one. Since the metric is one
of the route keys, the prefix route can not be atomically replaced.
