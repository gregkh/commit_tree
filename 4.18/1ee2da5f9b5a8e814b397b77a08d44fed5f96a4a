tools/memory-model: Rename link and rcu-path to rcu-link and rb

This patch makes a simple non-functional change to the RCU portion of
the Linux Kernel Memory Consistency Model by renaming the "link" and
"rcu-path" relations to "rcu-link" and "rb", respectively.

The name "link" was an unfortunate choice, because it was too generic
and subject to confusion with other meanings of the same word, which
occur quite often in LKMM documentation.  The name "rcu-path" is not
very appropriate, because the relation is analogous to the
happens-before (hb) and propagates-before (pb) relations -- although
that fact won't become apparent until the second patch in this series.
