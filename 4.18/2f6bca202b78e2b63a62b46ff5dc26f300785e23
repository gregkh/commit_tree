scsi: hisi_sas: add check of device in hisi_sas_task_exec()

Currently we don't check that device is not gone before dereferencing
its elements in the function hisi_sas_task_exec() (specifically, the DQ
pointer).

This patch fixes this issue by filling in the DQ pointer in
hisi_sas_task_prep() after we check that the device pointer is still
safe to reference.
