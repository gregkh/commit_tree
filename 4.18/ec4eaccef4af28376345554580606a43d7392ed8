rcu: Make rcu_migrate_callbacks wake GP kthread when needed

The rcu_migrate_callbacks() function invokes rcu_advance_cbs()
twice, ignoring the return value.  This is OK at pressent because of
failsafe code that does the wakeup when needed.  However, this failsafe
code acquires the root rcu_node structure's lock frequently, while
rcu_migrate_callbacks() does so only once per CPU-offline operation.

This commit therefore makes rcu_migrate_callbacks()
wake up the RCU GP kthread when either call to rcu_advance_cbs()
returns true, thus removing need for the failsafe code.
