iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: fix FIFO threshold mask for LSM6DSM/LSM6DSL

According to the latest datasheet, LSM6DSM and LSM6DSL imu sensors
export GENMASK(10, 0) for FIFO threshold mask definition. Despite
that is not an actual issue since write on fifo_th register is protected
by max_fifo_size value, fix fifo_th and fifo_diff register definitions
