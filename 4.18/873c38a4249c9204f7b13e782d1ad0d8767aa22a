char: sparc64: Add privileged ADI driver

SPARC M7 and newer processors utilize ADI to version and
protect memory.  This driver is capable of reading/writing
ADI/MCD versions from privileged user space processes.
Addresses in the adi file are mapped linearly to physical
memory at a ratio of 1:adi_blksz.  Thus, a read (or write)
of offset K in the file operates upon the ADI version at
physical address K * adi_blksz.  The version information
is encoded as one version per byte.  Intended consumers
are makedumpfile and crash.
