iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex - make the primary / secondary pick traffic aware

The primary channel is the channel that will be untouched by BT. The
secondary channel might be touched by BT.  Hence, we want the primary
to be the most active channel.  To do so, use the TCM infrastructure.

Since the BT keeps sending notifications, we can rely on them to
trigger the check. Every 10 seconds, we will check what is the most
active context and chose the right primary.

We need to wait 10 seconds before we modify the settings because
frequent changes in these settings can confuse BT.
