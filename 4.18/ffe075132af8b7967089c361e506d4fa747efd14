checkpatch: fix duplicate invalid vsprintf pointer extension '%p<foo>' messages

Multiline statements with invalid %p<foo> uses produce multiple
warnings.  Fix that.

e.g.:

$ cat t_block.c
void foo(void)
{
	MY_DEBUG(drv->foo,
		 "%pk",
		 foo->boo);
}

$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f t_block.c
WARNING: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#1: FILE: t_block.c:1:
+void foo(void)

WARNING: Invalid vsprintf pointer extension '%pk'
#3: FILE: t_block.c:3:
+	MY_DEBUG(drv->foo,
+		 "%pk",
+		 foo->boo);

WARNING: Invalid vsprintf pointer extension '%pk'
#3: FILE: t_block.c:3:
+	MY_DEBUG(drv->foo,
+		 "%pk",
+		 foo->boo);

total: 0 errors, 3 warnings, 6 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

t_block.c has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
