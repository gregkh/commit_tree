qede: Support flow classification to the VFs.

With the supported classification modes [4 tuples based,
udp port based, src-ip based], flows can be classified
to the VFs as well. With this patch, flows can be re-directed
to the requested VF provided in "action" field of command.

Please note that driver doesn't really care about the queue bits
in "action" field for the VFs. Since queue will be still chosen
by FW using RSS hash. [I.e., the classification would be done
according to vport-only]

For examples -

ethtool -N p5p1 flow-type udp4 dst-port 8000 action 0x100000000
ethtool -N p5p1 flow-type tcp4 src-ip 192.16.6.10 action 0x200000000
ethtool -U p5p1 flow-type tcp4 src-ip 192.168.40.100 dst-ip \
	192.168.40.200 src-port 6660 dst-port 5550 \
	action 0x100000000
