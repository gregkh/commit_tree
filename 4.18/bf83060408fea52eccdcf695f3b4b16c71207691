Remove calls to suspend/resume atomic helpers from amdgpu_device_gpu_recover. (v2)

First of all it's already being called from the display code from amd_ip_funcs.suspend/resume hooks.
Second of all, the place in amdgpu_device_gpu_recover it's being called is wrong for GPU stalls since
it is called BEFORE we cancel and force completion of all in flight jobs which were not yet processed.
So, as Bas pointed in the ticket we will try to wait for fence  in amdgpu_pm_compute_clocks but the pipe
is hanged so we end up in deadlock.

v2: remove unused variable
