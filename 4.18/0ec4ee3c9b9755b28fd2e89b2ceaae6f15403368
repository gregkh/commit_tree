mmc: sdhci-omap: Fix when capabilities are obtained from SDHCI_CAPABILITIES reg

sdhci_omap_config_iodelay_pinctrl_state() requires caps and caps2 to be
initialized (speed mode capabilities like UHS/HS200) before it is
invoked. While mmc_of_parse() initializes caps/caps2 if capabilities is
populated in device tree, it will remain uninitialized for capabilities
obtained from SDHCI_CAPABILITIES register.
Fix sdhci_omap_config_iodelay_pinctrl_state() to be used even while
getting the capabilities from SDHCI_CAPABILITIES register by invoking
sdhci_setup_host() before sdhci_omap_config_iodelay_pinctrl_state().
