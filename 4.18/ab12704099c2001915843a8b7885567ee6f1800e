bpf: add documentation for eBPF helpers (58-64)

Add documentation for eBPF helper functions to bpf.h user header file.
This documentation can be parsed with the Python script provided in
another commit of the patch series, in order to provide a RST document
that can later be converted into a man page.

The objective is to make the documentation easily understandable and
accessible to all eBPF developers, including beginners.

This patch contains descriptions for the following helper functions, all
written by John:

- bpf_redirect_map()
- bpf_sk_redirect_map()
- bpf_sock_map_update()
- bpf_msg_redirect_map()
- bpf_msg_apply_bytes()
- bpf_msg_cork_bytes()
- bpf_msg_pull_data()

v4:
- bpf_redirect_map(): Fix typos: "XDP_ABORT" changed to "XDP_ABORTED",
  "his" to "this". Also add a paragraph on performance improvement over
  bpf_redirect() helper.

v3:
- bpf_sk_redirect_map(): Improve description of BPF_F_INGRESS flag.
- bpf_msg_redirect_map(): Improve description of BPF_F_INGRESS flag.
- bpf_redirect_map(): Fix note on CPU redirection, not fully implemented
  for generic XDP but supported on native XDP.
- bpf_msg_pull_data(): Clarify comment about invalidated verifier
  checks.
