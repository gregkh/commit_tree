arm64: kpti: Use early_param for kpti= command-line option

We inspect __kpti_forced early on as part of the cpufeature enable
callback which remaps the swapper page table using non-global entries.

Ensure that __kpti_forced has been updated to reflect the kpti=
command-line option before we start using it.
