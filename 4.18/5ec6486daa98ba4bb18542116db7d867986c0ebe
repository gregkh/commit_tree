iio:imu: inv_mpu6050: support more interrupt types

Currently, we support only rising edge interrupts, and in fact we assume
that the interrupt we're given is rising edge (and things won't work if
it's not). However, the device supports rising edge, falling edge, level
low, and level high interrupts.

Empirically, on my system, switching to level interrupts has fixed a
problem I had with significant (~40%) interrupt loss with edge
interrupts. This issue is likely related to the SoC I'm using (Allwinner
H3), but being able to switch the interrupt type is still a very useful
workaround.

I tested this with each interrupt type and verified correct behavior in
a logic analyzer.

Add support for these interrupt types while also eliminating the error
case of the device tree and driver using different interrupt types.
