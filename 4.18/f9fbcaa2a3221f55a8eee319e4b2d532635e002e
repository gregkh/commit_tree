btrfs: move btrfs_raid_mindev_errorvalues to btrfs_raid_attr table

Add a new member struct btrfs_raid_attr::mindev_error so that
btrfs_raid_array can maintain the error code to return if the minimum
number of devices condition is not met while trying to delete a device
in the given raid. And so we can drop btrfs_raid_mindev_error.
