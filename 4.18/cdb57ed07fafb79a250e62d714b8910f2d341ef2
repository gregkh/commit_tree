i40e: implement flush flag for ndo_xdp_xmit

When passed the XDP_XMIT_FLUSH flag i40e_xdp_xmit now performs the
same kind of ring tail update as in i40e_xdp_flush.  The advantage is
that all the necessary checks have been performed and xdp_ring can be
updated, instead of having to perform the exact same steps/checks in
i40e_xdp_flush
