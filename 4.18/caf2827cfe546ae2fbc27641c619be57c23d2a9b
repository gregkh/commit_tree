media: ddbridge/mci: add identifiers to function definition arguments

Fixes two checkpatch warnings

  WARNING: function definition argument 'xxx' should also have an identifier name

in the ddb_mci_attach() prototype definition. checkpatch keeps complaining
on the "int (**fn_set_input)" as it seems to have issues with the
ptr-to-ptr, though this probably needs fixing in checkpatch.
