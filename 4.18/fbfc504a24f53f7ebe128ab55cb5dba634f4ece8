bpf: introduce new bpf AF_XDP map type BPF_MAP_TYPE_XSKMAP

The xskmap is yet another BPF map, very much inspired by
dev/cpu/sockmap, and is a holder of AF_XDP sockets. A user application
adds AF_XDP sockets into the map, and by using the bpf_redirect_map
helper, an XDP program can redirect XDP frames to an AF_XDP socket.

Note that a socket that is bound to certain ifindex/queue index will
*only* accept XDP frames from that netdev/queue index. If an XDP
program tries to redirect from a netdev/queue index other than what
the socket is bound to, the frame will not be received on the socket.

A socket can reside in multiple maps.

v3: Fixed race and simplified code.
v2: Removed one indirection in map lookup.
