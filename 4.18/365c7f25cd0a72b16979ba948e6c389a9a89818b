ALSA: hda/ca0132: Restore behavior of QUIRK_ALIENWARE

Commit e93ac30a32a6ba7ac3b4b2a4379af1dadb91e505 (ALSA: HDA/ca0132:
add extra init functions for r3di + sbz) introduced an extra
initialization function that was improperly guarded, taking effect
on systems with QUIRK_ALIENWARE, even though such systems were
supposedly not affected.

It may be that this piece of initialization should be done for all
systems, but that's not a call that I can make.
