staging: ks7010: change parameter type in ks_wlan_hw_rx function

The parameter 'size' in function ks_wlan_hw_rx is declared as
uint16_t and can be declared as size_t which makes more sense.
It is being passed to hif_align_size function which also expects
a size_t as parameter so just change its type. Also update two
casts in calls to this function.
