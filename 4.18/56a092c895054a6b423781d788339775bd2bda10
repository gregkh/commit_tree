bpf: add script and prepare bpf.h for new helpers documentation

Remove previous "overview" of eBPF helpers from user bpf.h header.
Replace it by a comment explaining how to process the new documentation
(to come in following patches) with a Python script to produce RST, then
man page documentation.

Also add the aforementioned Python script under scripts/. It is used to
process include/uapi/linux/bpf.h and to extract helper descriptions, to
turn it into a RST document that can further be processed with rst2man
to produce a man page. The script takes one "--filename <path/to/file>"
option. If the script is launched from scripts/ in the kernel root
directory, it should be able to find the location of the header to
parse, and "--filename <path/to/file>" is then optional. If it cannot
find the file, then the option becomes mandatory. RST-formatted
documentation is printed to standard output.

Typical workflow for producing the final man page would be:

    $ ./scripts/bpf_helpers_doc.py \
            --filename include/uapi/linux/bpf.h > /tmp/bpf-helpers.rst
    $ rst2man /tmp/bpf-helpers.rst > /tmp/bpf-helpers.7
    $ man /tmp/bpf-helpers.7

Note that the tool kernel-doc cannot be used to document eBPF helpers,
whose signatures are not available directly in the header files
(pre-processor directives are used to produce them at the beginning of
the compilation process).

v4:
- Also remove overviews for newly added bpf_xdp_adjust_tail() and
  bpf_skb_get_xfrm_state().
- Remove vague statement about what helpers are restricted to GPL
  programs in "LICENSE" section for man page footer.
- Replace license boilerplate with SPDX tag for Python script.

v3:
- Change license for man page.
- Remove "for safety reasons" from man page header text.
- Change "packets metadata" to "packets" in man page header text.
- Move and fix comment on helpers introducing no overhead.
- Remove "NOTES" section from man page footer.
- Add "LICENSE" section to man page footer.
- Edit description of file include/uapi/linux/bpf.h in man page footer.
