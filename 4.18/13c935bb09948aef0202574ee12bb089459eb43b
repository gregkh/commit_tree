crypto: api - laying defines and checks for statically allocated buffers

In preparation for the removal of VLAs[1] from crypto code.
We create 2 new compile-time constants: all ciphers implemented
in Linux have a block size less than or equal to 16 bytes and
the most demanding hw require 16 bytes alignment for the block
buffer.
We also enforce these limits in crypto_check_alg when a new
cipher is registered.
