arm64/sve: Switch sve_pffr() argument from task to thread

sve_pffr(), which is used to derive the base address used for
low-level SVE save/restore routines, currently takes the relevant
task_struct as an argument.

The only accessed fields are actually part of thread_struct, so
this patch changes the argument type accordingly.  This is done in
preparation for moving this function to a header, where we do not
want to have to include <linux/sched.h> due to the consequent
circular #include problems.

No functional change.
