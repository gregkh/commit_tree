mmc: sdhci-msm: support voltage pad switching

The PADs for SD card are dual-voltage that support 3v/1.8v. Those PADs
have a control signal  (io_pad_pwr_switch/mode18 ) that indicates
whether the PAD works in 3v or 1.8v.

SDHC core on msm platforms should have IO_PAD_PWR_SWITCH bit set/unset
based on actual voltage used for IO lines. So when power irq is
triggered for io high or io low, the driver should check the voltages
supported and set the pad accordingly.
