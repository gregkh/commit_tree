can: xilinx_can: fix incorrect clear of non-processed interrupts

xcan_interrupt() clears ERROR|RXOFLV|BSOFF|ARBLST interrupts if any of
them is asserted. This does not take into account that some of them
could have been asserted between interrupt status read and interrupt
clear, therefore clearing them without handling them.

Fix the code to only clear those interrupts that it knows are asserted
and therefore going to be processed in xcan_err_interrupt().
