Drivers: hv: vmbus: enable VMBus protocol version 5.0

With VMBus protocol 5.0, we're able to better support new features, e.g.
running two or more VMBus drivers simultaneously in a single VM -- note:
we can't simply load the current VMBus driver twice, instead, a secondary
VMBus driver must be implemented.

This patch adds the support for the new VMBus protocol, which is available
on new Windows hosts, by:

1) We still use SINT2 for compatibility;
2) We must use Connection ID 4 for the Initiate Contact Message, and for
subsequent messages, we must use the Message Connection ID field in
the host-returned VersionResponse Message.

Notes for developers of the secondary VMBus driver:
1) Must use VMBus protocol 5.0 as well;
2) Must use a different SINT number that is not in use.
3) Must use Connection ID 4 for the Initiate Contact Message, and for
subsequent messages, must use the Message Connection ID field in
the host-returned VersionResponse Message.
4) It's possible that the primary VMBus driver using protocol version 4.0
can work with a secondary VMBus driver using protocol version 5.0, but it's
recommended that both should use 5.0 for new Hyper-V features in the future.
