x86/platform/UV: Use new set memory block size function

Add a call to the new function to "adjust" the current fixed UV memory
block size of 2GB so it can be changed to a different physical boundary.
This accommodates changes in the Intel BIOS, and therefore UV BIOS,
which now can align boundaries different than the previous UV standard
of 2GB.  It also flags any UV Global Address boundaries from BIOS that
cause a change in the mem block size (boundary).

The current boundary of 2GB has been used on UV since the first system
release in 2009 with Linux 2.6 and has worked fine.  But the new NVDIMM
persistent memory modules (PMEM), along with the Intel BIOS changes to
support these modules caused the memory block size boundary to be set
to a lower limit.  Intel only guarantees that this minimum boundary at
64MB though the current Linux limit is 128MB.

Note that the default remains 2GB if no changes occur.
