spi: spi-s3c64xx: Fix system resume support

Since Linux v4.10 release (commit 1d9174fbc55e "PM / Runtime: Defer
resuming of the device in pm_runtime_force_resume()"),
pm_runtime_force_resume() function doesn't runtime resume device if it was
not runtime active before system suspend. Thus, driver should not do any
register access after pm_runtime_force_resume() without checking the
runtime status of the device. To fix this issue, simply move
s3c64xx_spi_hwinit() call to s3c64xx_spi_runtime_resume() to ensure that
hardware is always properly initialized. This fixes Synchronous external
abort issue on system suspend/resume cycle on newer Exynos SoCs.
