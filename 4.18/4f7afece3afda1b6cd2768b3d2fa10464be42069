video: fbdev: sh_mobile_meram: Drop SUPERH platform dependency

Since commit a521422ea4ae6128 ("ARM: shmobile: mackerel: Remove Legacy C
board code"), the only remaining platforms using this driver are SuperH
SH-Mobile SoCs (sh7723).  As both SUPERH and ARCH_SHMOBILE are set for
these platforms, the SUPERH dependency can be dropped.
