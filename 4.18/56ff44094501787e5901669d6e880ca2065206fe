ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add default jack-detect settings

Out of the 11 BYTCR devices which I have access to for testing, 6 use
JD1IN4P for jack-detect, 2 use JD1IN4P non-inverted and the other 3 use
JD2IN4N, the ones not using JD1IN4P are all also special in other ways and
need a DMI quirk regardless.

All 5 BYT (non CR) devices which I have access to use JD2IN4N.
