Input: elan_i2c_smbus - fix more potential stack buffer overflows

Commit 40f7090bb1b4 ("Input: elan_i2c_smbus - fix corrupted stack")
fixed most of the functions using i2c_smbus_read_block_data() to
allocate a buffer with the maximum block size.  However three
functions were left unchanged:

* In elan_smbus_initialize(), increase the buffer size in the same
  way.
* In elan_smbus_calibrate_result(), the buffer is provided by the
  caller (calibrate_store()), so introduce a bounce buffer.  Also
  name the result buffer size.
* In elan_smbus_get_report(), the buffer is provided by the caller
  but happens to be the right length.  Add a compile-time assertion
  to ensure this remains the case.
