irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix reprogramming of redistributors on CPU hotplug

Enabling LPIs was made a lot stricter recently, by checking that they are
disabled before enabling them. By doing so, the CPU hotplug case was missed
altogether, which leaves LPIs enabled on hotplug off (expecting the CPU to
eventually come back), and won't write a different value anyway on hotplug
on.

So skip that check if that particular case is detected
