drm/bridge/sii8620: fix potential buffer overflow

Buffer overflow error should not occur, as mode_fixup() callback
filters pixel clock value and it should never exceed 600000. However,
current implementation is not obviously safe and relies on
implementation of mode_fixup().

Make 'i' variable never reach unsafe value in order to avoid buffer
overflow error.
