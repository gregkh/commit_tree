powerpc: use time64_t in read_persistent_clock

Looking through the remaining users of the deprecated mktime()
function, I found the powerpc rtc handlers, which use it in
place of rtc_tm_to_time64().

To clean this up, I'm changing over the read_persistent_clock()
function to the read_persistent_clock64() variant, and change
all the platform specific handlers along with it.
