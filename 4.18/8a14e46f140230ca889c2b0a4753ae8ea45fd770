net/ipv6: Fix missing rcu dereferences on from

kbuild test robot reported 2 uses of rt->from not properly accessed
using rcu_dereference:
1. add rcu_dereference_protected to rt6_remove_exception_rt and make
   sure it is always called with rcu lock held.

2. change rt6_do_redirect to take a reference on 'from' when accessed
   the first time so it can be used the sceond time outside of the lock
