powerpc/powernv/cpuidle: Init all present cpus for deep states

Init all present cpus for deep states instead of "all possible" cpus.
Init fails if a possible cpu is guarded. Resulting in making only
non-deep states available for cpuidle/hotplug.

Stewart says, this means that for single threaded workloads, if you
guard out a CPU core you'll not get WoF (Workload Optimised
Frequency), which means that performance goes down when you wouldn't
expect it to.
