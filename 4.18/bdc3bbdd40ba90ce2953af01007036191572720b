clk: qcom: Clear hardware clock control bit of RCG

For upcoming targets like sdm845, POR value of the hardware clock control
bit is set for most of root clocks which needs to be cleared for software
to be able to control. For older targets like MSM8996, this bit is reserved
bit and having POR value as 0 so this patch will work for the older targets
too. So update the configuration mask to take care of the same to clear
hardware clock control bit.
