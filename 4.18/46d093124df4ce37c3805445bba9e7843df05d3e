staging: mt7621-pci: improve interrupt mapping

As the Interrupts for the PCI adapters are listed in
devicetree we shouldn't need to have them explicit in the code.

The simplest way to do this is to use of_irq_parse_and_map_pci()
and specify an interrupt-map which identifies the different
PCI hosts by bus/slot numbers.
This has the advantage that the hwirq number are mapped to virq
numbers for us, so the ugly hack can go.
