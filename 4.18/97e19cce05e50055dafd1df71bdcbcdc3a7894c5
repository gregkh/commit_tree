bpf: reserve xdp_frame size in xdp headroom

Commit 6dfb970d3dbd ("xdp: avoid leaking info stored in frame data on
page reuse") tried to allow user/bpf_prog to (re)use area used by
xdp_frame (stored in frame headroom), by memset clearing area when
bpf_xdp_adjust_head give bpf_prog access to headroom area.

The mentioned commit had two bugs. (1) Didn't take bpf_xdp_adjust_meta
into account. (2) a combination of bpf_xdp_adjust_head calls, where
xdp->data is moved into xdp_frame section, can cause clearing
xdp_frame area again for area previously granted to bpf_prog.

After discussions with Daniel, we choose to implement a simpler
solution to the problem, which is to reserve the headroom used by
xdp_frame info.

This also avoids the situation where bpf_prog is allowed to adjust/add
headers, and then XDP_REDIRECT later drops the packet due to lack of
headroom for the xdp_frame.  This would likely confuse the end-user.
