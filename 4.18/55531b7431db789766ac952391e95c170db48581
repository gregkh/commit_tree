KVM: s390: Add storage key facility interpretation control

Up to now we always expected to have the storage key facility
available for our (non-VSIE) KVM guests. For huge page support, we
need to be able to disable it, so let's introduce that now.

We add the use_skf variable to manage KVM storage key facility
usage. Also we rename use_skey in the mm context struct to uses_skeys
to make it more clear that it is an indication that the vm actively
uses storage keys.
