cpufreq: intel_pstate: allow trace in passive mode

Allow use of the trace_pstate_sample trace function
when the intel_pstate driver is in passive mode.
Since the core_busy and scaled_busy fields are not
used, and it might be desirable to know which path
through the driver was used, either intel_cpufreq_target
or intel_cpufreq_fast_switch, re-task the core_busy
field as a flag indicator.

The user can then use the intel_pstate_tracer.py utility
to summarize and plot the trace.

Note: The core_busy feild still goes by that name
in include/trace/events/power.h and within the
intel_pstate_tracer.py script and csv file headers,
but it is graphed as "performance", and called
core_avg_perf now in the intel_pstate driver.

Sometimes, in passive mode, the driver is not called for
many tens or even hundreds of seconds. The user
needs to understand, and not be confused by, this limitation.
