perf hists: Reimplement hists__has_callchains()

There are places where we have only access to struct hists and need to
know if any of its hist_entries has callchains, like when drawing
headers for the various output modes (stdio, TUI, etc), so, when adding
a new hist_entry, check if it has callchains, storing this info for
later use by hists__has_callchains().

This reimplementation is necessary because not always a 'struct hists'
is allocated together with a 'struct perf evsel', so we can't go from
'hists' to 'perf_event_attr.sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_CALLCHAIN'.
