xfs: log item flags are racy

The log item flags contain a field that is protected by the AIL
lock - the XFS_LI_IN_AIL flag. We use non-atomic RMW operations to
set and clear these flags, but most of the updates and checks are
not done with the AIL lock held and so are susceptible to update
races.

Fix this by changing the log item flags to use atomic bitops rather
than be reliant on the AIL lock for update serialisation.
