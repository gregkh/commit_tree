rcu/x86: Provide early rcu_cpu_starting() callback

The x86/mtrr code does horrific things because hardware. It uses
stop_machine_from_inactive_cpu(), which does a wakeup (of the stopper
thread on another CPU), which uses RCU, all before the CPU is onlined.

RCU complains about this, because wakeups use RCU and RCU does
(rightfully) not consider offline CPUs for grace-periods.

Fix this by initializing RCU way early in the MTRR case.
