crypto: tcrypt - Remove VLA usage

In the quest to remove all stack VLA usage from the kernel[1], this
allocates the return code buffers before starting jiffie timers, rather
than using stack space for the array. Additionally cleans up some exit
paths and make sure that the num_mb module_param() is used only once
per execution to avoid possible races in the value changing.
