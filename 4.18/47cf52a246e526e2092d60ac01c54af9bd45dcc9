selftests/bpf: test offloads even with BPF programs present

Modern distroes increasingly make use of BPF programs.  Default
Ubuntu 18.04 installation boots with a number of cgroup_skb
programs loaded.

test_offloads.py tries to check if programs and maps are not
leaked on error paths by confirming the list of programs on the
system is empty between tests.

Since we can no longer expect the system to have no BPF objects
at boot try to remember the programs and maps present at the start,
and skip those when scanning the system.
