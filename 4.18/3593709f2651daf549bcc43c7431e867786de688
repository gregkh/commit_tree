PCI: rockchip: Split out common function to init controller

Most of the initialization are used for both of RC driver and
EP driver; factor the initialization out to a new function,
rockchip_pcie_init_port(), in pcie-rockchip.c and rename the
original function to rockchip_pcie_host_init_port() to avoid
confusion. No functional changed intended.
