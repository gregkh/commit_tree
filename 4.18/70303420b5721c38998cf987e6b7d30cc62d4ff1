tracing: Check for no filter when processing event filters

The syzkaller detected a out-of-bounds issue with the events filter code,
specifically here:

	prog[N].pred = NULL;					/* #13 */
	prog[N].target = 1;		/* TRUE */
	prog[N+1].pred = NULL;
	prog[N+1].target = 0;		/* FALSE */
->	prog[N-1].target = N;
	prog[N-1].when_to_branch = false;

As that's the first reference to a "N-1" index, it appears that the code got
here with N = 0, which means the filter parser found no filter to parse
(which shouldn't ever happen, but apparently it did).

Add a new error to the parsing code that will check to make sure that N is
not zero before going into this part of the code. If N = 0, then -EINVAL is
returned, and a error message is added to the filter.
