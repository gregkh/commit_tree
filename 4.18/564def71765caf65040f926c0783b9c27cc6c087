proc: Add a way to make network proc files writable

Provide two extra functions, proc_create_net_data_write() and
proc_create_net_single_write() that act like their non-write versions but
also set a write method in the proc_dir_entry struct.

An internal simple write function is provided that will copy its buffer and
hand it to the pde->write() method if available (or give an error if not).
The buffer may be modified by the write method.
