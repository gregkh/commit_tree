netfilter: nf_tables: don't allow to rename to already-pending name

Its possible to rename two chains to the same name in one
transaction:

nft add chain t c1
nft add chain t c2
nft 'rename chain t c1 c3;rename chain t c2 c3'

This creates two chains named 'c3'.

Appears to be harmless, both chains can still be deleted both
by name or handle, but, nevertheless, its a bug.

Walk transaction log and also compare vs. the pending renames.

Both chains can still be deleted, but nevertheless it is a bug as
we don't allow to create chains with identical names, so we should
prevent this from happening-by-rename too.
