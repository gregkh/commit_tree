i2c: tegra: Remove suspend-resume

Nothing prevents I2C clients to access I2C while Tegra's driver is being
suspended, this results in -EBUSY error returned to the clients and that
may have unfortunate consequences. In particular this causes problems
for the TPS6586x MFD driver which emits hundreds of "failed to read
interrupt status" error messages on resume from suspend. This happens if
TPS6586X is used to wake system from suspend by the expired RTC alarm
timer because TPS6586X is an I2C device driver and its IRQ handler reads
the status register while Tegra's I2C driver is suspended, i.e. just after
kernel enabled IRQ's during of resume-from-suspend process.

Note that the removed tegra_i2c_resume() invoked tegra_i2c_init() which
performs HW reset. That seems was also not entirely correct because moving
tegra_i2c_resume to an earlier stage of resume-from-suspend process causes
I2C transfer to fail in the case of TPS6586X. It is fine to remove the
HW-reinitialization for now because it should be only needed in a case of
using lowest power-mode during suspend, which upstream kernel doesn't
support.
