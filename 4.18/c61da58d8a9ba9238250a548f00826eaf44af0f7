locking/qspinlock: Kill cmpxchg() loop when claiming lock from head of queue

When a queued locker reaches the head of the queue, it claims the lock
by setting _Q_LOCKED_VAL in the lockword. If there isn't contention, it
must also clear the tail as part of this operation so that subsequent
lockers can avoid taking the slowpath altogether.

Currently this is expressed as a cmpxchg() loop that practically only
runs up to two iterations. This is confusing to the reader and unhelpful
to the compiler. Rewrite the cmpxchg() loop without the loop, so that a
failed cmpxchg() implies that there is contention and we just need to
write to _Q_LOCKED_VAL without considering the rest of the lockword.
