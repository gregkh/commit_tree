typec: tcpm: Correctly report power_supply current and voltage for non pd supply

Commit f2a8aa053c17 ("typec: tcpm: Represent source supply through
power_supply") moved the code to register a power_supply representing
the device supplying power to the type-C connector, from the fusb302
code to the generic tcpm code so that we have a psy reporting the
supply voltage and current for all tcpm devices.

This broke the reporting of current and voltage through the psy interface
when supplied by a a non pd supply (5V, current as reported by
get_current_limit). The cause of this breakage is port->supply_voltage
and port->current_limit not being set in that case.

This commit fixes this by setting port->supply_voltage and
port->current_limit from tcpm_set_current_limit().

This commit also removes setting supply_voltage and current_limit
from tcpm_reset_port() as that calls tcpm_set_current_limit(0, 0)
which now already sets these to 0.
