perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add infrastructure for free running counters

There are a number of free running counters introduced for uncore, which
provide highly valuable information to a wide array of customers.
However, the generic uncore code doesn't support them yet.

The free running counters will be specially handled based on their
unique attributes:

 - They are read-only. They cannot be enabled/disabled.

 - The event and the counter are always 1:1 mapped. It doesn't need to
   be assigned nor tracked by event_list.

 - They are always active. It doesn't need to check the availability.

 - They have different bit width.

Also, using inline helpers to replace the check for fixed counter and
free running counter.
