media: uvcvideo: Prevent setting unavailable flags

The addition of an extra operation to use the GET_INFO command
overwrites all existing flags from the uvc_ctrls table. This includes
setting all controls as supporting GET_MIN, GET_MAX, GET_RES, and
GET_DEF regardless of whether they do or not.

Move the initialisation of these control capabilities directly to the
uvc_ctrl_fill_xu_info() call where they were originally located in that
use case, and ensure that the new functionality in uvc_ctrl_get_flags()
will only set flags based on their reported capability from the GET_INFO
call.
