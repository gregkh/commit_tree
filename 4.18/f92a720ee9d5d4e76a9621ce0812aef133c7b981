cifs: allow disabling less secure legacy dialects

To improve security it may be helpful to have additional ways to restrict the
ability to override the default dialects (SMB2.1, SMB3 and SMB3.02) on mount
with old dialects (CIFS/SMB1 and SMB2) since vers=1.0 (CIFS/SMB1) and vers=2.0
are weaker and less secure.

Add a module parameter "disable_legacy_dialects"
(/sys/module/cifs/parameters/disable_legacy_dialects) which can be set to
1 (or equivalently Y) to forbid use of vers=1.0 or vers=2.0 on mount.

Also cleans up a few build warnings about globals for various module parms.
