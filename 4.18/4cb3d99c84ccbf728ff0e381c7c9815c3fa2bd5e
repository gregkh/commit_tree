bpf: add faked "ending" subprog

There are quite a few code snippet like the following in verifier:

       subprog_start = 0;
       if (env->subprog_cnt == cur_subprog + 1)
               subprog_end = insn_cnt;
       else
               subprog_end = env->subprog_info[cur_subprog + 1].start;

The reason is there is no marker in subprog_info array to tell the end of
it.

We could resolve this issue by introducing a faked "ending" subprog.
The special "ending" subprog is with "insn_cnt" as start offset, so it is
serving as the end mark whenever we iterate over all subprogs.
