connector: add parent pid and tgid to coredump and exit events

The intention is to get notified of process failures as soon
as possible, before a possible core dumping (which could be very long)
(e.g. in some process-manager). Coredump and exit process events
are perfect for such use cases (see 2b5faa4c553f "connector: Added
coredumping event to the process connector").

The problem is that for now the process-manager cannot know the parent
of a dying process using connectors. This could be useful if the
process-manager should monitor for failures only children of certain
parents, so we could filter the coredump and exit events by parent
process and/or thread ID.

Add parent pid and tgid to coredump and exit process connectors event
data.
