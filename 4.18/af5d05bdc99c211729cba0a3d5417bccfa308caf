arm64: dts: allwinner: Add dts file for Libre Computer Board ALL-H3-CC H5 ver.

The Libre Computer Board ALL-H3-CC from Libre Technology is a Raspberry
Pi B+ form factor single board computer based on the Allwinner H2+, H3,
or H5 SoCs with the same PCB.
The board has 2GB DDR3 SDRAM, provided by 4 2Gb chips. The mounting holes
and connectors are in the exact same position as on the Raspberry Pi B+.

This patch enables the H5 variant using the H3 board definition moved to
a common dtsi in an earlier patch. The dts simply include the common dtsi
and declares the correct compatible and model of the H5 variant.
