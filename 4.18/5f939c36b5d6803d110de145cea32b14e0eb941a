media: lgdt330x: add block error counts via DVBv5

Show the UCB error counts via DVBv5.

Please notice that there's no scale indication at the driver.
As we don't have the datasheet, let's assume that it is receiving
data at a rate of 10.000 packets per second. Ideally, this should
be read or estimated.

In order to avoid flooding I2C bus with data, the maximum
polling rate for those stats was set to 1 second.
