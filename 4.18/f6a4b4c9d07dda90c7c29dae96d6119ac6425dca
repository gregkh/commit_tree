orangefs: set i_size on new symlink

As long as a symlink inode remains in-core, the destination (and
therefore size) will not be re-fetched from the server, as it cannot
change.  The original implementation of the attribute cache assumed that
setting the expiry time in the past was sufficient to cause a re-fetch
of all attributes on the next getattr.  That does not work in this case.

The bug manifested itself as follows.  When the command sequence

touch foo; ln -s foo bar; ls -l bar

is run, the output was

lrwxrwxrwx. 1 fedora fedora 4906 Apr 24 19:10 bar -> foo

However, after a re-mount, ls -l bar produces

lrwxrwxrwx. 1 fedora fedora    3 Apr 24 19:10 bar -> foo

After this commit, even before a re-mount, the output is

lrwxrwxrwx. 1 fedora fedora    3 Apr 24 19:10 bar -> foo
