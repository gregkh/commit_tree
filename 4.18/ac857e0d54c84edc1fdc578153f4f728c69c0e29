block, bfq: remove the removal of 'next' rq in bfq_requests_merged

Since bfq_finish_request() is always called on the request 'next',
after bfq_requests_merged() is finished, and bfq_finish_request()
removes 'next' from its bfq_queue if needed, it isn't necessary to do
such a removal in advance in bfq_merged_requests().

This commit removes such a useless 'next' removal.
