staging: ks7010: add SPDX identifiers to all files

It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.

Fix up the all of the staging ks7010 files to have a proper SPDX
identifier, based on the license text in the file itself.  The SPDX
identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used instead of
the full boiler plate text.

Extra GPL text wording can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
