bpf: make cavium thunder compatible w/ bpf_xdp_adjust_tail

w/ bpf_xdp_adjust_tail helper xdp's data_end pointer could be changed as
well (only "decrease" of pointer's location is going to be supported).
changing of this pointer will change packet's size.
for cavium's thunder driver we will just calculate packet's length
unconditionally
