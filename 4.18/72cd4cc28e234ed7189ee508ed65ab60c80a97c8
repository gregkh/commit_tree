nvme-pci: Fix AER reset handling

The nvme timeout handling doesn't do anything if the pci channel is
offline, which is the case when recovering from PCI error event, so it
was a bad idea to sync the controller reset in this state. This patch
flushes the reset work in the error_resume callback instead when the
channel is back to online. This keeps AER handling serialized and
can recover from timeouts.
