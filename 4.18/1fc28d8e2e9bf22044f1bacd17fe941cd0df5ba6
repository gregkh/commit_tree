Btrfs: move get root out of btrfs_search_slot to a helper

It's good to have a helper instead of having all get-root details
open-coded.  The new helper locks (if necessary) and sets root node of
the path.

Also invert the checks to make the code flow easier to read.  There is
no functional change in this commit.
