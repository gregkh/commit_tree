KVM: arm/arm64: Helper to register a new redistributor region

We introduce a new helper that creates and inserts a new redistributor
region into the rdist region list. This helper both handles the case
where the redistributor region size is known at registration time
and the legacy case where it is not (eventually depending on the number
of online vcpus). Depending on pfns, we perform all the possible checks
that we can do:

- end of memory crossing
- incorrect alignment of the base address
- collision with distributor region if already defined
- collision with already registered rdist regions
- check of the new index

Rdist regions must be inserted by increasing order of indices. Indices
must be contiguous.
