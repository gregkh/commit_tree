arm64: KVM: Use lm_alias() for kvm_ksym_ref()

For historical reasons, we open-code lm_alias() in kvm_ksym_ref().

Let's use lm_alias() to avoid duplication and make things clearer.

As we have to pull this from <linux/mm.h> (which is not safe for
inclusion in assembly), we may as well move the kvm_ksym_ref()
definition into the existing !__ASSEMBLY__ block.
