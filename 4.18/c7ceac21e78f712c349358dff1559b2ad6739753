staging: wilc1000: remove 'flag' argument from wilc_mac_indicate()

Remove 'flag' function parameter in wilc_mac_indicate() as only one
condition was handled using that parameter. Also removed unnecessary
call to wilc_mac_indicate() as no operation was performed in that
function call.
After above changes below macros are not required anymore.
WILC_MAC_INDICATE_STATUS	0x1
WILC_MAC_INDICATE_SCAN		0x2

This changes also helped in resolving the line over 80 chars issue
found by checkatpch.pl script.
