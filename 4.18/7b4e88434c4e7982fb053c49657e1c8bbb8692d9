Smack: Mark inode instant in smack_task_to_inode

Smack: Mark inode instant in smack_task_to_inode

/proc clean-up in commit 1bbc55131e59bd099fdc568d3aa0b42634dbd188
resulted in smack_task_to_inode() being called before smack_d_instantiate.
This resulted in the smk_inode value being ignored, even while present
for files in /proc/self. Marking the inode as instant here fixes that.
