dpaa_eth: DPAA SGT needs to be 256B

The DPAA HW requires that at least 256 bytes from the start of the
first scatter-gather table entry are allocated and accessible. The
hardware reads the maximum size the table can have in one access,
thus requiring that the allocation and mapping to be done for the
maximum size of 256B even if there is a smaller number of entries
in the table.
