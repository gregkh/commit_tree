block: add ioprio_check_cap function

Aio per command iopriority support introduces a second interface between
userland and the kernel capable of passing iopriority. The aio interface also
needs the ability to verify that the submitting context has sufficient
privileges to submit IOPRIO_RT commands. This patch creates the
ioprio_check_cap function to be used by the ioprio_set system call and also by
the aio interface.
