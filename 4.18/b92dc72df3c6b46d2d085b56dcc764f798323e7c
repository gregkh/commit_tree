scsi: lpfc: Fix port initialization failure.

The driver exits port setup after failing the lpfc_sli4_get_parameters
command (messages 0356, 2541, & 1412).

The older CNA adapters do not support the MBX command. In the past
the code was allowed to fail and continue on with initialization.
However a nvme change moved a closing bracket and now makes all
failures terminal.

Revise the logic so that terminal failure only occurs if the command
failed on the newer adapters. Additionally, if parameters are set
that require information from the command and the command failed,
the parameters are erroneous and port set up should fail even on
the older adapters.
