drm/scheduler: don't update last scheduled fence in TDR

The current sequence in scheduler thread is:
1. update last sched fence
2. job begin (adding to mirror list)
3. job finish (remove from mirror list)
4. back to 1

Since we update last sched prior to joining mirror list, the jobs
in mirror list already pass the last sched fence. TDR just run
the jobs in mirror list, so we should not update the last sched
fences in TDR.
