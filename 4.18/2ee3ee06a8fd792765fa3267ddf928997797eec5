ext4: fix hole length detection in ext4_ind_map_blocks()

When ext4_ind_map_blocks() computes a length of a hole, it doesn't count
with the fact that mapped offset may be somewhere in the middle of the
completely empty subtree. In such case it will return too large length
of the hole which then results in lseek(SEEK_DATA) to end up returning
an incorrect offset beyond the end of the hole.

Fix the problem by correctly taking offset within a subtree into account
when computing a length of a hole.
