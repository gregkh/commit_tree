x86/Hyper-V/hv_apic: Build the Hyper-V APIC conditionally

The Hyper-V APIC code is built when CONFIG_HYPERV is enabled but the actual
code in that file is guarded with CONFIG_X86_64. There is no point in doing
this. Neither is there a point in having the CONFIG_HYPERV guard in there
because the containing directory is not built when CONFIG_HYPERV=n.

Further for the hv_init_apic() function a stub is provided only for
CONFIG_HYPERV=n, which is pointless as the callsite is not compiled at
all. But for X86_32 the stub is missing and the build fails.

Clean that up:

  - Compile hv_apic.c only when CONFIG_X86_64=y
  - Make the stub for hv_init_apic() available when CONFG_X86_64=n
