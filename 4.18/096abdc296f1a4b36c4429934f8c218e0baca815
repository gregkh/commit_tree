clk: msm8996-gcc: Mark halt check as no-op for USB/PCIE pipe_clk

The USB and PCIE pipe clocks are sourced from external clocks
inside the QMP USB/PCIE PHYs. Enabling or disabling of PIPE RCG
clocks is dependent on PHY initialization sequence hence
update halt_check to BRANCH_HALT_SKIP for these clocks so
that clock status bit is not polled when enabling or disabling
the clocks. It allows to simplify PHY client driver code which
is both user and source of the pipe_clk and avoid error logging
related status check on clk_disable/enable.
