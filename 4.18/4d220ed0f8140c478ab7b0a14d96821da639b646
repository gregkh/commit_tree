bpf: remove tracepoints from bpf core

tracepoints to bpf core were added as a way to provide introspection
to bpf programs and maps, but after some time it became clear that
this approach is inadequate, so prog_id, map_id and corresponding
get_next_id, get_fd_by_id, get_info_by_fd, prog_query APIs were
introduced and fully adopted by bpftool and other applications.
The tracepoints in bpf core started to rot and causing syzbot warnings:
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3008 at kernel/trace/trace_event_perf.c:274
Kernel panic - not syncing: panic_on_warn set ...
perf_trace_bpf_map_keyval+0x260/0xbd0 include/trace/events/bpf.h:228
trace_bpf_map_update_elem include/trace/events/bpf.h:274 [inline]
map_update_elem kernel/bpf/syscall.c:597 [inline]
SYSC_bpf kernel/bpf/syscall.c:1478 [inline]
Hence this patch deletes tracepoints in bpf core.
