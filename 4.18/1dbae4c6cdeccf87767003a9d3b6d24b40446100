iio:dac:ad5686: Add AD5681R/AD5682R/AD5683/AD5683R support

The AD5681R/AD5682R/AD5683/AD5683R are a family of one channel DACs with
12-bit, 14-bit and 16-bit precision respectively. The devices have either
no built-in reference, or built-in 2.5V reference.

These devices are similar to AD5691R/AD5692R/AD5693/AD5693R except
with a few notable differences:
 * they use the SPI interface instead of I2C
 * in the write control register, DB18 and DB17 are used for setting the
   power mode, while DB16 is the REF bit. This is why a new regmap type
   was defined and checked accordingly.
 * the shift register is 24 bits wide, the first four bits are the command
   bits followed by the data bits. As the data comprises of 20-bit, 18-bit
   or 16-bit input code, this means that 4 LSB bits are don't care. This is
   why the data needs to be shifted on the left with four bits. Therefore,
   AD5683_REGMAP is checked inside a switch case in the ad5686_spi_write()
   function. On the other hand, similar devices such as AD5693R family,
   have the 4 MSB command bits followed by 4 don't care bits.
