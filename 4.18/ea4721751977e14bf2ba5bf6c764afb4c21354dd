mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Ignore bridge VLAN events

A follow-up patch enables emitting VLAN notifications for the bridge CPU
port in addition to the existing slave port notifications. These
notifications have orig_dev set to the bridge in question.

Because there's no specific support for these VLANs, just ignore the
notifications to maintain the current behavior.
