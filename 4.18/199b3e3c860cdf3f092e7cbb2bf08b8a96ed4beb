thermal: exynos: remove parsing of samsung, tmu_cal_type property

Since calibration type for temperature is SoC (not platform) specific
just move it from platform data to struct exynos_tmu_data instance.
Then remove parsing of samsung,tmu_cal_type property. Also remove no
longer needed platform data structure.

There should be no functional changes caused by this patch.
