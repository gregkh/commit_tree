media: lgdt330x: constify several register init arrays

There are several register init arrays there that can be
constified.

The change reduced a little bit the amount of initialized
data:

   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   6372	    360	      4	   6736	   1a50	old/drivers/media/dvb-frontends/lgdt330x.o
   6500	    264	      4	   6768	   1a70	new/drivers/media/dvb-frontends/lgdt330x.o
