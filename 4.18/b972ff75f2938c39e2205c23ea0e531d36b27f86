arm64: defconfig: Enable UFS on msm8996

Enable GLINK RPM so that we get RPM regulators and clocks and enable the
UFS host controller driver and the Qualcomm UFS platform driver. The UFS
phy is selected by the Qualcomm UFS driver.

The simple ondemand devfreq governor must be builtin, as there's no
mechanism for automatically loading it, causing UFS HCD initialization
to fail.
