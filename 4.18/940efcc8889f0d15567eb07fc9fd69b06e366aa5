RDMA/uverbs: Protect from attempts to create flows on unsupported QP

Flows can be created on UD and RAW_PACKET QP types. Attempts to provide
other QP types as an input causes to various unpredictable failures.

The reason is that in order to support all various types (e.g. XRC), we
are supposed to use real_qp handle and not qp handle and expect to
driver/FW to fail such (XRC) flows. The simpler and safer variant is to
ban all QP types except UD and RAW_PACKET, instead of relying on
driver/FW.
