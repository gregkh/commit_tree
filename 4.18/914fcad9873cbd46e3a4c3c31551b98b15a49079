xprtrdma: Fix max_send_wr computation

For FRWR, the computation of max_send_wr is split between
frwr_op_open and rpcrdma_ep_create, which makes it difficult to tell
that the max_send_wr result is currently incorrect if frwr_op_open
has to reduce the credit limit to accommodate a small max_qp_wr.
This is a problem now that extra WRs are needed for backchannel
operations and a drain CQE.

So, refactor the computation so that it is all done in ->ro_open,
and fix the FRWR version of this computation so that it
accommodates HCAs with small max_qp_wr correctly.
