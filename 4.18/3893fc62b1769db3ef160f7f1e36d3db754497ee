qed*: Support other classification modes.

Currently, driver supports flow classification to PF
receive queues based on TCP/UDP 4 tuples [src_ip, dst_ip,
src_port, dst_port] only.

This patch enables to configure different flow profiles
[For example - only UDP dest port or src_ip based] on the
adapter so that classification can be done according to
just those fields as well. Although, at a time just one
type of flow configuration is supported due to limited
number of flow profiles available on the device.

For example -

ethtool -N enp7s0f0 flow-type udp4 dst-port 45762 action 2
ethtool -N enp7s0f0 flow-type tcp4 src-ip 192.16.4.10 action 1
ethtool -N enp7s0f0 flow-type udp6 dst-port 45762 action 3
