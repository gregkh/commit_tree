netfilter: conntrack: dccp: treat SYNC/SYNCACK as invalid if no prior state

When first DCCP packet is SYNC or SYNCACK, we insert a new conntrack
that has an un-initialized timeout value, i.e. such entry could be
reaped at any time.

Mark them as INVALID and only ignore SYNC/SYNCACK when connection had
an old state.
