btrfs: Unexport and rename btrfs_invalidate_inodes

This function is no longer used outside of inode.c so just make it
static. At the same time give a more becoming name, since it's not
really invalidating the inodes but just calling d_prune_alias. Last,
but not least - move the function above the sole caller to avoid
introducing yet-another-pointless forward declaration.
