x86/apic: Provide apic_ack_irq()

apic_ack_edge() is explicitely for handling interrupt affinity cleanup when
interrupt remapping is not available or disable.

Remapped interrupts and also some of the platform specific special
interrupts, e.g. UV, invoke ack_APIC_irq() directly.

To address the issue of failing an affinity update with -EBUSY the delayed
affinity mechanism can be reused, but ack_APIC_irq() does not handle
that. Adding this to ack_APIC_irq() is not possible, because that function
is also used for exceptions and directly handled interrupts like IPIs.

Create a new function, which just contains the conditional invocation of
irq_move_irq() and the final ack_APIC_irq().

Reuse the new function in apic_ack_edge().

Preparatory change for the real fix.
