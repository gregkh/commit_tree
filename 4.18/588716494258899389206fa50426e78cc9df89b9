kvm: vmx: Introduce lapic_mode enumeration

The local APIC can be in one of three modes: disabled, xAPIC or
x2APIC. (A fourth mode, "invalid," is included for completeness.)

Using the new enumeration can make some of the APIC mode logic easier
to read. In kvm_set_apic_base, for instance, it is clear that one
cannot transition directly from x2APIC mode to xAPIC mode or directly
from APIC disabled to x2APIC mode.
