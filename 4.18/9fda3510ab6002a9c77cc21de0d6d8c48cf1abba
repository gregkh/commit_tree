net/smc: move link group list to smc_core

This patch moves the global link group list to smc_core where the link
group functions are. To make this work, it moves code in af_smc and
smc_ib that operates on the link group list to smc_core as well.

While at it, the link group counter is integrated into the list
structure and initialized to zero.
