infiniband: i40iw: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in i40iw_l2param_change

i40iw_l2param_change() is never called in atomic context.

i40iw_make_listen_node() is only set as ".l2_param_change"
in struct i40e_client_ops, and this function pointer is not called
in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
i40iw_l2param_change() calls kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
which can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
