ACPI / EC: Use ec_no_wakeup on Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th

On this system EC interrupt triggers constantly kicking devices out of
low power states and thus blocking power management. The system also has
a PCIe root port hosting Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt controller and it
never gets a chance to go to D3cold because of this.

Since the power button works the same regardless if EC interrupt is
enabled or not during s2idle, add a quirk for this machine that sets
ec_no_wakeup=true preventing spurious wakeups.
