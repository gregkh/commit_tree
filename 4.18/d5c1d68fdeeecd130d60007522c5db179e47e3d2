btrfs: compression: Add linux/sizes.h for compression.h

Since compression.h is using the SZ_* macros, and if some file includes
only compression.h without linux/sizes.h, it will cause compile error.

One example is lzo.c, if it uses BTRFS_MAX_COMPRESSED.  Fix it by adding
linux/sizes.h in compression.h
