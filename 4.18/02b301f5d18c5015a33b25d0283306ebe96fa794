ARM: dts: sun8i: r40: bananapi-m2-ultra: Sort device node dereferences

The device nodes dereference (&foo) usages should be sorted by the label
names, barring any parsing order issues such as the #include statement
for the PMIC's .dtsi file that must come after the PMIC.

Move the mmc and ohci blocks in front of the PMIC's regulator blocks.
