ASoC: uniphier: add digital output volume for UniPhier sound system

This patch adds controllers for digital volume of PCM output. Volume
effects simply linear, not dB scale as follows:
  Gained PCM = Original * 0x4000 / Volume

The value range of volume is from 0x0001 to 0xffff. 0x0000 works as
mute. Initial value is 0x4000 (+0dB).
