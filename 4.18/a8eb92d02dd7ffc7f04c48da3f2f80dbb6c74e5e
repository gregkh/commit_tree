arc: fix arc_dma_{map,unmap}_page

These functions should perform the same cache synchronoization as calling
arc_dma_sync_single_for_{cpu,device} in addition to doing any required
address translation or mapping [1].  Ensure they actually do that by calling
arc_dma_sync_single_for_{cpu,device} instead of passing the dir argument
along to _dma_cache_sync.

The now unused _dma_cache_sync function is removed as well.

[1] in fact various drivers rely on that by passing DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC
to the map/unmap routines and doing the cache synchronization manually.
