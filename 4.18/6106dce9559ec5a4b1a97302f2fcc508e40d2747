drm/amdkfd: Try to enable atomics for all GPUs

Report failure to enable atomics only on GPUs that require them.
This allows GPUs that don't require atomics to function, but can
benefit if they are available. This is the case for Vega10, which
doesn't use atomics for basic functioning of the MEC, AQL and HWS
microcode. So it can work without atomics. But shader programs can
still use atomic instructions on systems that support PCIe atomics.
