net: stmmac: dwmac-sun8i: Support different ranges for TX/RX delay chains

On the R40 SoC, the RX delay chain only has a range of 0~7 (hundred
picoseconds), instead of 0~31. Also the TX delay chain is completely
absent.

This patch adds support for different ranges by adding per-compatible
maximum values in the variant data. A maximum of 0 indicates that the
delay chain is not supported or absent.
