scsi: cxlflash: Isolate external module dependencies

Depending on the underlying transport, cxlflash has a dependency on either
the CXL or OCXL drivers, which are enabled via their Kconfig option.
Instead of having a module wide dependency on these config options, it is
better to isolate the object modules that are dependent on the CXL and OCXL
drivers and adjust the module dependencies accordingly.

This commit isolates the object files that are dependent on CXL and/or
OCXL. The cxl/ocxl fops used in the core driver are tucked under an ifdef to
avoid compilation errors.
