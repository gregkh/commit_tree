ANDROID: binder: correct the cmd print for BINDER_WORK_RETURN_ERROR

When to execute binder_stat_br the e->cmd has been modifying as BR_OK
instead of the original return error cmd, in fact we want to know the
original return error, such as BR_DEAD_REPLY or BR_FAILED_REPLY, etc.
instead of always BR_OK, in order to avoid the value of the e->cmd is
always BR_OK, so we need assign the value of the e->cmd to cmd before
e->cmd = BR_OK.
