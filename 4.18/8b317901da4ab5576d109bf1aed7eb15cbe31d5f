btrfs: trace: Allow trace_qgroup_update_counters() to record old rfer/excl value

Origin trace_qgroup_update_counters() only records qgroup id and its
reference count change.

It's good enough to debug qgroup accounting change, but when rescan race
is involved, it's pretty hard to distinguish which modification belongs
to which rescan.

So add old_rfer and old_excl trace output to help distinguishing
different rescan instance.
(Different rescan instance should reset its qgroup->rfer to 0)

For trace event parameter, it just changes from u64 qgroup_id to struct
btrfs_qgroup *qgroup, so number of parameters is not changed at all.
