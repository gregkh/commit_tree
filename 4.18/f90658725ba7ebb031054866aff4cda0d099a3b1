tracing: Make create_filter() code match the comments

The comment in create_filter() states that the passed in filter pointer
(filterp) will either be NULL or contain an error message stating why the
filter failed. But it also expects the filter pointer to point to NULL when
passed in. If it is not, the function create_filter_start() will warn and
return an error message without updating the filter pointer. This is not
what the comment states.

As we always expect the pointer to point to NULL, if it is not, trigger a
WARN_ON(), set it to NULL, and then continue the path as the rest will work
as the comment states. Also update the comment to state it must point to
NULL.
