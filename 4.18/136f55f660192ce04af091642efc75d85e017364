net: lan78xx: fix rx handling before first packet is send

As long the bh tasklet isn't scheduled once, no packet from the rx path
will be handled. Since the tx path also schedule the same tasklet
this situation only persits until the first packet transmission.
So fix this issue by scheduling the tasklet after link reset.
