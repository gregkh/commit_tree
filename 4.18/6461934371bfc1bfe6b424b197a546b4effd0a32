irqdomain: Let irq_find_host default to DOMAIN_BUS_WIRED

At the beginning of times, irq_find_host() was simple. Each device node
implemented at most one irq domain, and we were happy. Over time, things
have become more complex, and we now have nodes implementing a plurality
of domains, tagged by "bus_token".

Crutially, users of irq_find_host() all expect the most basic domain
to be returned, and not any other domain such as a bus-specific MSI
domain.

So let's change irq_find_host() to first look for a DOMAIN_BUS_WIRED
domain, and only if this fails fallback to DOMAIN_BUS_ANY. Note that
this is consistent with what irq_create_fwspec_mapping is already
doing, see 530cbe100ef7 ("irqdomain: Allow domain lookup with
DOMAIN_BUS_WIRED token").
