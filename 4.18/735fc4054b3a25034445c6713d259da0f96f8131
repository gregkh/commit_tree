xdp: change ndo_xdp_xmit API to support bulking

This patch change the API for ndo_xdp_xmit to support bulking
xdp_frames.

When kernel is compiled with CONFIG_RETPOLINE, XDP sees a huge slowdown.
Most of the slowdown is caused by DMA API indirect function calls, but
also the net_device->ndo_xdp_xmit() call.

Benchmarked patch with CONFIG_RETPOLINE, using xdp_redirect_map with
single flow/core test (CPU E5-1650 v4 @ 3.60GHz), showed
performance improved:
 for driver ixgbe: 6,042,682 pps -> 6,853,768 pps = +811,086 pps
 for driver i40e : 6,187,169 pps -> 6,724,519 pps = +537,350 pps

With frames avail as a bulk inside the driver ndo_xdp_xmit call,
further optimizations are possible, like bulk DMA-mapping for TX.

Testing without CONFIG_RETPOLINE show the same performance for
physical NIC drivers.

The virtual NIC driver tun sees a huge performance boost, as it can
avoid doing per frame producer locking, but instead amortize the
locking cost over the bulk.

V2: Fix compile errors reported by kbuild test robot <lkp@intel.com>
V4: Isolated ndo, driver changes and callers.
