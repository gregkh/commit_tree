nfp: bpf: support setting the RX queue index

BPF has access to all internal FW datapath structures.  Including
the structure containing RX queue selection.  With little coordination
with the datapath we can let the offloaded BPF select the RX queue.
We just need a way to tell the datapath that queue selection has already
been done and it shouldn't overwrite it.  Define a bit to tell datapath
BPF already selected a queue (QSEL_SET), if the selected queue is not
enabled (>= number of enabled queues) datapath will perform normal RSS.

BPF queue selection on the NIC can be used to replace standard
datapath RSS with fully programmable BPF/XDP RSS.
