bpf: get JITed image lengths of functions via syscall

This adds new two new fields to struct bpf_prog_info. For
multi-function programs, these fields can be used to pass
a list of the JITed image lengths of each function for a
given program to userspace using the bpf system call with
the BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD command.

This can be used by userspace applications like bpftool
to split up the contiguous JITed dump, also obtained via
the system call, into more relatable chunks corresponding
to each function.
