scsi: hisi_sas: check sas_dev gone earlier in hisi_sas_abort_task()

It is possible to dereference a NULL-pointer in hisi_sas_abort_task() in
special scenario when the device has been removed.

If an SMP task times-out, it will call hisi_sas_abort_task() to
recover. And currently there is a check in hisi_sas_abort_task() to
avoid the situation of processing the abort for the removed device.

However we have an ordering problem, in that we may reference a task for
the removed device before checking if the device has been removed.

Fix this by only referencing the sas_dev after we know it is still
present.
