xfs: factor out nodiscard helpers

The changes to skip discards of speculative preallocation and
unwritten extents introduced several new wrapper functions through
the bunmapi -> extent free codepath to reduce churn in all of the
associated callers. In several cases, these wrappers simply toggle a
single flag to skip or not skip discards for the resulting blocks.

The explicit _nodiscard() wrappers for such an isolated set of
callers is a bit overkill. Kill off these wrappers and replace with
the calls to the underlying functions in the contexts that need to
control discard behavior. Retain the wrappers that preserve the
original calling conventions to serve the original purpose of
reducing code churn.

This is a refactoring patch and does not change behavior.
