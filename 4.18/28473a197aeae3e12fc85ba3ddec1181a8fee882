media: ddbridge: fix output buffer check

A 188 byte gap has to be left between the writer and the consumer. This
requires 2*188 bytes available to be able to write to the output buffers.
So, change ddb_output_free() to report free bytes according to this rule.

Picked up from the upstream dddvb-0.9.33 release.
