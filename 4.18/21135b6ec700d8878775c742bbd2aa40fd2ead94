Revert "ARM: dts: am437x-sk-evm: Correct tps65218 irq type"

This reverts commit 561f9bcf268422ebe78a1739d86a255fd481c71c.

While the correct IRQ level fixed the WARN_ON(), but prevented the probe
of tps65218 as GIC_SPI does not support LEVEL_LOW (?)

Use LEVEL_HIGH as it looks to be the accurate one since the INTn of TPS is
connected to NMIn of the SoC.
