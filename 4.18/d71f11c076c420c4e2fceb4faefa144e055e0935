perf/x86/intel/uncore: Correct fixed counter index check for NHM

For Nehalem and Westmere, there is only one fixed counter for W-Box.
There is no index which is bigger than UNCORE_PMC_IDX_FIXED.
It is not correct to use >= to check fixed counter.
The code quality issue will bring problem when new counter index is
introduced.
