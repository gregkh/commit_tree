drm/nouveau/gem: tie deferred unmapping of buffers to VMA fence completion

As VMAs are per-client, unlike buffers, this allows us to avoid referencing
foreign fences (those that belong to another client/driver) from the client
deferred work handler, and prevent some not-fun race conditions that can be
triggered when a fence stalls.
