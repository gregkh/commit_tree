ion: Consider ion pool pages as indirectly reclaimable

An issue is observed where mallocs are failing due to overcommit failure.
The failure happens when there is high ION page pool since ION page
pool is not considered reclaimable by the overcommit calculation code.
This change considers ion pool pages as indirectly reclaimable and thus
accounted as available memory in the overcommit calculation.
