net: hns3: Fix for packet loss due wrong filter config in VLAN tbls

There are two level of vlan tables in hardware, one is port vlan
which is shared by all functions, the other one is function
vlan table, each function has it's own function vlan table.
Currently, PF sets the port vlan table, and vf sets the function
vlan table, which will cause packet lost problem.

This patch fixes this problem by setting both vlan table, and
use hdev->vlan_table to manage thet port vlan table.
