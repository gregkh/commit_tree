HID: i2c-hid: Silently fail probe for CHPN0001 touchscreen

The CHPN0001 ACPI device has a _CID of PNP0C50 and even has the _DSM to
get the HID descriptor address, but it is not a HID device at all.

It uses its own protocol which is handled by the (still being upstreamed)
chipone_icn8505 driver. I guess the _CID and the _DSM are the result of
a copy and paste job when the vendor was building the ACPI tables.

Before this patch the i2c_hid_driver's probe function will fail with a
"hid_descr_cmd failed" error.

This commit makes the i2c_hid_driver's probe function instead silently
ignored devices with an ACPI id of CHPN0001.
