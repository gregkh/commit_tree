rcu: exp: Fix "must hold exp_mutex" comments for QS reporting functions

Since commit d9a3da0699b2 ("rcu: Add expedited grace-period support
for preemptible RCU"), there are comments for some funtions in
rcu_report_exp_rnp()'s call-chain saying that exp_mutex or its
predecessors needs to be held.

However, exp_mutex and its predecessors were used only to synchronize
between GPs, and it is clear that all variables visited by those functions
are under the protection of rcu_node's ->lock. Moreover, those functions
are currently called without held exp_mutex, and seems that doesn't
introduce any trouble.

So this patch fixes this problem by updating the comments to match the
current code.
