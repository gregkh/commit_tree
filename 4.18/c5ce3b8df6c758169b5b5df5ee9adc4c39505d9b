drm/i915/execlists: Don't trigger preemption if complete

Due to the latency of the tasklet running from ksoftirqd, by the time we
process the execlist dequeue may be a long time behind the GPU. If the
request was completed when we ran reschedule, we will not have tweaked
its priority, but if it is still listed as being in-flight for dequeue
we will use it as a reference for the rest of the queue, including
requests from its own context which will now be at higher priority. This
can cause us to issue a preempt-to-idle request, even though the request
we want to preempt is already complete.
