neighbour: support for NTF_EXT_LEARNED flag

This patch extends NTF_EXT_LEARNED support to the neighbour system.
Example use-case: An Ethernet VPN implementation (eg in FRR routing suite)
can use this flag to add dynamic reachable external neigh entires
learned via control plane. The use of neigh NTF_EXT_LEARNED in this
patch is consistent with its use with bridge and vxlan fdb entries.
