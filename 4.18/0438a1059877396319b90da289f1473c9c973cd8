drm/i915/gvt: do not return error on handling force_to_nonpriv registers

Return error will cause vm hang and enter failsafe mode.
However, we don't want that happen on detecting an wrong force_to_nonpriv
register write.
Therefore, we just omit the wrong write or patch it to default value.

v2: only return 0 on detecting lri write of registers outside whitelist,
but still return error on other error conditions.  (zhenyu wang)
