lib/rhashtable: consider param->min_size when setting initial table size

rhashtable_init() currently does not take into account the user-passed
min_size parameter unless param->nelem_hint is set as well. As such,
the default size (number of buckets) will always be HASH_DEFAULT_SIZE
even if the smallest allowed size is larger than that. Remediate this
by unconditionally calling into rounded_hashtable_size() and handling
things accordingly.
