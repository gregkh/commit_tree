Input: xpad - fix GPD Win 2 controller name

This fixes using the controller with SDL2.

SDL2 has a naive algorithm to apply the correct settings to a controller.
For X-Box compatible controllers it expects that the controller name
contains a variation of a 'XBOX'-string.

This patch changes the identifier to contain "X-Box" as substring.  Tested
with Steam and C-Dogs-SDL which both detect the controller properly after
adding this patch.
