serial: 8250_dw: Limit dw8250_tx_wait_empty quirk to armada-38x devices

The previous implementation has had a detrimental effect on devices using
high bitrates (bluetooth), as the fifo being non-empty for a single check
would result in a 10 Âµs delay.

Limit the change to devices with the new "marvell,armada-38x-uart"
compatible string. Also update the code to allow the first 1000 retries
to not perform a delay.

The maximum duration of retries has been increased to cover a worst-case
seen on the Armada 385 SoC. "dmesg ; resize", will fill the buffer with
text to output before doing a resize. At 9600 baud this took up to 13 ms
to flush all characters and avoid some getting lost.
