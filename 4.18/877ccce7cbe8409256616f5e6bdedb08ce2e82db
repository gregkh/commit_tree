crypto: x86/aegis,morus - Fix and simplify CPUID checks

It turns out I had misunderstood how the x86_match_cpu() function works.
It evaluates a logical OR of the matching conditions, not logical AND.
This caused the CPU feature checks for AEGIS to pass even if only SSE2
(but not AES-NI) was supported (or vice versa), leading to potential
crashes if something tried to use the registered algs.

This patch switches the checks to a simpler method that is used e.g. in
the Camellia x86 code.

The patch also removes the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE declarations which
actually seem to cause the modules to be auto-loaded at boot, which is
not desired. The crypto API on-demand module loading is sufficient.
