ixgbe: Fix setting of TC configuration for macvlan case

When we were enabling macvlan interfaces we weren't correctly configuring
things until ixgbe_setup_tc was called a second time either by tweaking the
number of queues or increasing the macvlan count past 15.

The issue came down to the fact that num_rx_pools is not populated until
after the queues and interrupts are reinitialized.

Instead of trying to set it sooner we can just move the call to setup at
least 1 traffic class to the SR-IOV/VMDq setup function so that we just set
it for this one case. We already had a spot that was configuring the queues
for TC 0 in the code here anyway so it makes sense to also set the number
of TCs here as well.
