drm/bridge: Add Cadence DSI driver

Add a driver for Cadence DPI -> DSI bridge.

This driver only support a subset of Cadence DSI bridge capabilities.

This driver has been tested/debugged in a simulated environment which
explains why some of the features are missing.  Here is a
non-exhaustive list of missing features:
 * burst mode
 * DPHY init/configuration steps
 * support for additional input interfaces (SDI input)

DSI commands and non-burst video mode have been tested.
