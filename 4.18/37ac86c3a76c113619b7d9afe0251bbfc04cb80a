SUNRPC: Initialize rpc_rqst outside of xprt->reserve_lock

alloc_slot is a transport-specific op, but initializing an rpc_rqst
is common to all transports. In addition, the only part of initial-
izing an rpc_rqst that needs serialization is getting a fresh XID.

Move rpc_rqst initialization to common code in preparation for
adding a transport-specific alloc_slot to xprtrdma.
