liquidio: make timeout HZ independent and readable

schedule_timeout_* takes a timeout in jiffies but the code currently is
passing in a constant which makes this timeout HZ dependent. So define
a constant with (hopefully) meaningful name and pass it through
msecs_to_jiffies() to fix the HZ dependency.
