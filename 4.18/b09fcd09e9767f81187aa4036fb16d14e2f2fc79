scsi: hisi_sas: Add v2 hw force PHY function for internal ATA command

This patch adds a force PHY function for internal ATA command for v2 hw.

Because there is an SoC bug in v2 hw, and need send an IO through each PHY
of a port to work around a bug which occurs after a controller reset.

This force PHY function will be used in the later patch.
