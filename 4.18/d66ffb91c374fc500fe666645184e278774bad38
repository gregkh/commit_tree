pwm: stm32: Improve capture by tuning counter prescaler

Currently, capture is based on timeout window to configure prescaler.
PWM capture framework provides 1s window at the time of writing.

There's place for improvement, after input signal has been captured once:
- Finer tune counter clock prescaler, by using 1st capture result (with
arbitrary margin).
- Do a 2nd capture, with scaled capture window.
This increases accuracy, especially at high rates.
