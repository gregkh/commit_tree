net: ethernet: fix suspend/resume in davinci_emac

This patch reverts commit 3243ff2a05ec ("net: ethernet: davinci_emac:
Deduplicate bus_find_device() by name matching") and adds a comment
which should stop anyone from reintroducing the same "fix" in the future.

We can't use bus_find_device_by_name() here because the device name is
not guaranteed to be 'davinci_mdio'. On some systems it can be
'davinci_mdio.0' so we need to use strncmp() against the first part of
the string to correctly match it.
