mlxsw: core_acl_flex_actions: Remove redundant counter destruction

Each tc flower rule uses a hidden count action. As counter resource may
not be available due to limited HW resources, update _counter_create()
and _counter_destroy() pair to follow previously introduced symmetric
error condition handling, add a call to mlxsw_afa_resource_del() as part
of the counter resource destruction.
