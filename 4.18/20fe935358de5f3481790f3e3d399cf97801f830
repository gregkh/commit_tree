exofs: avoid VLA in structures

On the quest to remove all VLAs from the kernel[1] this adjusts several
cases where allocation is made after an array of structures that points
back into the allocation.  The allocations are changed to perform
explicit calculations instead of using a Variable Length Array in a
structure.

Additionally, this lets Clang compile this code now, since Clang does
not support VLAIS[2].
