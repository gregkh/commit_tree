drm/bridge/sii8620: Fix display of packed pixel modes

Current implementation does not guarantee packed pixel modes working
with every dongle. There are some dongles, which require selecting
the output mode explicitly.

Write proper values to registers in packed_pixel mode, based on how it
is done in vendor's code. Select output color space: RGB
(no packed pixel) or YCBCR422 (packed pixel).

This reverts commit e8b92efa629dac0e70ea4145c5e70616de5f89c8
("drm/bridge/sii8620: fix display of packed pixel modes in MHL2").
