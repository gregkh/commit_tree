mm: do not drop unused pages when userfaultd is running

KVM guests on s390 can notify the host of unused pages.  This can result
in pte_unused callbacks to be true for KVM guest memory.

If a page is unused (checked with pte_unused) we might drop this page
instead of paging it.  This can have side-effects on userfaultd, when
the page in question was already migrated:

The next access of that page will trigger a fault and a user fault
instead of faulting in a new and empty zero page.  As QEMU does not
expect a userfault on an already migrated page this migration will fail.

The most straightforward solution is to ignore the pte_unused hint if a
userfault context is active for this VMA.
