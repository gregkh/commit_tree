scsi: hisi_sas: Create a scsi_host_template per HW module

When a SCSI host is registered, the SCSI mid-layer takes a reference to a
module in Scsi_host.hostt.module. In doing this, we are prevented from
removing the driver module for the host in dangerous scenario, like when a
disk is mounted.

Currently there is only one scsi_host_template (sht) for all HW versions,
and this is the main.c module. So this means that we can possibly remove
the HW module in this dangerous scenario, as SCSI mid-layer is only
referencing the main.c module.

To fix this, create a sht per module, referencing that same module to
create the Scsi host.
