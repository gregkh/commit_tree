watchdog: hpwdt: Claim NMIs generated by iLO5

On iLO5 going forward we want to return and not claim the NMI, if
the NMI was NOT gnerated by the iLO as a result of the watchdog
timing out or an explicit generate NMI.

The sense of the test in is inverted and prevents hpwdt_pretimeout
from claiming NMIs when it should.
