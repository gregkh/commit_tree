gcc-plugins: allow to enable GCC_PLUGINS for COMPILE_TEST

Now that the compiler's plugin support is checked in Kconfig,
all{yes,mod}config will not be bothered.

Remove 'depends on !COMPILE_TEST' for GCC_PLUGINS.

'depends on !COMPILE_TEST' for the following three are still kept:
  GCC_PLUGIN_CYC_COMPLEXITY
  GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_VERBOSE
  GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT_PERFORMANCE

Kees suggested to do so because the first two are too noisy, and the
last one would reduce the compile test coverage.  I commented the
reasons in arch/Kconfig.
