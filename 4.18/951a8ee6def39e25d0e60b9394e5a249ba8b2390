nfp: reject binding to shared blocks

TC shared blocks allow multiple qdiscs to be grouped together and filters
shared between them. Currently the chains of filters attached to a block
are only flushed when the block is removed. If a qdisc is removed from a
block but the block still exists, flow del messages are not passed to the
callback registered for that qdisc. For the NFP, this presents the
possibility of rules still existing in hw when they should be removed.

Prevent binding to shared blocks until the kernel can send per qdisc del
messages when block unbinds occur.

tcf_block_shared() was not used outside of the core until now, so also
add an empty implementation for builds with CONFIG_NET_CLS=n.
