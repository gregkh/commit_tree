PCI: rcar: Factor out rcar_pcie_hw_init() call

rcar_pcie_hw_init_{h1|gen2|gen3}() only differ in the PCIe PHY init code
and all end with a call to rcar_pcie_hw_init(), thus it makes sense to
move that call into the driver's probe() method and then rename those
functions to rcar_pcie_phy_init_{h1|gen2|gen3}().
