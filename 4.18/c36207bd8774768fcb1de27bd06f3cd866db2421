tcp: remove mss check in tcp_select_initial_window()

In tcp_select_initial_window(), we only set rcv_wnd to
tcp_default_init_rwnd() if current mss > (1 << wscale). Otherwise,
rcv_wnd is kept at the full receive space of the socket which is a
value way larger than tcp_default_init_rwnd().
With larger initial rcv_wnd value, receive buffer autotuning logic
takes longer to kick in and increase the receive buffer.

In a TCP throughput test where receiver has rmem[2] set to 125MB
(wscale is 11), we see the connection gets recvbuf limited at the
beginning of the connection and gets less throughput overall.
