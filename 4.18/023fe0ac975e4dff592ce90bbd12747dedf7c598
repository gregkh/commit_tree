tools/power turbostat: if --num_iterations, print for specific number of iterations

There's a use case during test to only print specific round of iterations
if --num_iterations is specified, for example, with this patch applied:

turbostat -i 5 -n 4
will capture 4 samples with 5 seconds interval.

[lenb: renamed to --num_iterations from --iterations]
