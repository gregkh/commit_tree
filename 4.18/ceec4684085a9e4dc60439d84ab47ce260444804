ALSA: pci/hda: Remove unused, broken, header file

sound/pci/hda/local.h seems to be an earlier version of
sound/hda/local.h; it was added at the same time but doesn't seem to
have ever been used (within the git history).  Most of its macros
depend on a hdac_read_parm() function which is not defined anywhere.
