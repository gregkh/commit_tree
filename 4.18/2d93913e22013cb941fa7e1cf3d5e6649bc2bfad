crypto: chelsio - don't leak information from the stack to userspace

The structure crypto_info contains fields that are not initialized and
only .version is set.  The copy_to_user call is hence leaking information
from the stack to userspace which must be avoided. Fix this by zero'ing
all the unused fields.
