media: vsp1: Reword uses of 'fragment' as 'body'

Throughout the codebase, the term 'fragment' is used to represent a
display list body. This term duplicates the 'body' which is already in
use.

The datasheet references these objects as a body, therefore replace all
mentions of a fragment with a body, along with the corresponding
pluralised terms.
