tools/bpf: add a test for bpf_get_stack with raw tracepoint prog

The test attached a raw_tracepoint program to raw_syscalls/sys_enter.
It tested to get stack for user space, kernel space and user
space with build_id request. It also tested to get user
and kernel stack into the same buffer with back-to-back
bpf_get_stack helper calls.

If jit is not enabled, the user space application will check
to ensure that the kernel function for raw_tracepoint
___bpf_prog_run is part of the stack.

If jit is enabled, we did not have a reliable way to
verify the kernel stack, so just assume the kernel stack
is good when the kernel stack size is greater than 0.
