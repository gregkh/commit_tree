vfs: factor out inode_insert5()

Split out common helper for race free insertion of an already allocated
inode into the cache.  Use this from iget5_locked() and
insert_inode_locked4().  Make iget5_locked() use new_inode()/iput() instead
of alloc_inode()/destroy_inode() directly.

Also export to modules for use by filesystems which want to preallocate an
inode before file/directory creation.
