nvmet: add simple file backed ns support

This patch adds simple file backed namespace support for NVMeOF target.

The new file io-cmd-file.c is responsible for handling the code for I/O
commands when ns is file backed. Also, we introduce mempools based slow
path using sync I/Os for file backed ns to ensure forward progress under
reclaim.

The old block device based implementation is moved to io-cmd-bdev.c and
use a "nvmet_bdev_" symbol prefix.  The enable/disable calls are also
move into the respective files.
