lightnvm: proper error handling for pblk_bio_add_pages

Currently in case of error caused by bio_pc_add_page in
pblk_bio_add_pages two issues occur when calling from
pblk_rb_read_to_bio(). First one is in pblk_bio_free_pages, since we
are trying to free pages not allocated from our mempool. Second one
is the warn from dma_pool_free, that we are trying to free NULL
pointer dma.

This commit fix both issues.
