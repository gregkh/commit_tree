tools lib api fs tracing_path: Introduce opendir() method

That takes care of using the right call to get the tracing_path
directory, the one that will end up calling tracing_path_set() to figure
out where tracefs is mounted.

One more step in doing just lazy reading of system structures to reduce
the number of operations done unconditionaly at 'perf' start.
