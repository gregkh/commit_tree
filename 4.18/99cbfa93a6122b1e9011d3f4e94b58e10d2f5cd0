net/mlx5e: RX, Use cyclic WQ in legacy RQ

Now that LRO is not supported for Legacy RQ, there is no source of
out-of-order completions in the WQ, and we can use a cyclic one.
This has multiple advantages:
- reduces the WQE size (smaller PCI transactions).
- lower overhead in datapath (no handling of 'next' pointers).
- no reserved WQE for the WQ head (was need in linked-list).
- allows using a constant map between frag and dma_info struct, in downstream patch.

Performance tests:
ConnectX-4, single core, single RX ring.
Major gain in packet rate of single ring XDP drop.
Bottleneck is shifted form HW (at 16Mpps) to SW (at 20Mpps).
