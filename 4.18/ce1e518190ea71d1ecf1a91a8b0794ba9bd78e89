ide: don't disable interrupts during kmap_atomic()

ide_pio_bytes() disables interrupts around kmap_atomic(). This is a
leftover from the old kmap_atomic() implementation which relied on fixed
mapping slots, so the caller had to make sure that the same slot could not
be reused from an interrupting context.

kmap_atomic() was changed to dynamic slots long ago and commit 1ec9c5ddc17a
("include/linux/highmem.h: remove the second argument of k[un]map_atomic()")
removed the slot assignements, but the callers were not checked for now
redundant interrupt disabling.

Remove the conditional interrupt disable.
