lightnvm: pblk: remove unnecessary bio_get/put

In the read path, pblk gets a reference to the incoming bio and puts it
after ending the bio. Though this behavior is correct, it is unnecessary
since pblk is the one putting the bio, therefore, it cannot disappear
underneath it.

Removing this reference, allows to clean up rqd->bio and avoids pointer
bouncing for the different read paths. Now, the incoming bio always
resides in the read context and pblk's internal bios (if any) reside in
rqd->bio.
