net: hns3: Fixes the state to indicate client-type initialization

HNAE3 module supports kernel nic driver, user nic driver and roce driver,
and there are 3 client types. Driver uses one bit(HNAE3_CLIENT_INITED_B)
to indicate the client initialization state, it will cause confusion
for 3 client types. This patch fixes it by use 3 bits to indicate the
initialization state.
