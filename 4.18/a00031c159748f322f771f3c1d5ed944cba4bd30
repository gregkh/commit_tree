media: ddbridge: conditionally enable fast TS for stv0910-equipped bridges

CineS2 V7(A) and Octopus CI S2 Pro/Advanced cards support faster TS speeds
on the card's contained stv0910 demodulator when their FPGA was updated
with a recent (>= 1.7, version number applies to all mentioned cards)
vendor firmware. Enable this faster TS speed on card port 0 (contained
demod) and parallel stv0910 connections when the card firmware is at least
1.7 or later.

Note: The mentioned cards and their demods are handled via the STV0910_PR
and STV0910_P tuner types. DuoFlex modules with such demodulators are
handled via the STV0910 (without suffix) types where such TS speed
increase doesn't technically make sense.
