drm/i915/execlists: Drop preemption arbitrations points along the ring

Limit the arbitration (where preemption may occur) to inside the batch,
and prevent it from happening on the pipecontrols/flushes we use to
write the breadcrumb seqno. Once the user batch is complete, we have
nothing left to do but serialise and emit the breadcrumb; switching
contexts at this point is futile so don't.
