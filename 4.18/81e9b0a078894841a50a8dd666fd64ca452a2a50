ASoC: topology: Give more data to clients via callbacks

Give topology clients more access to the topology data by passing index,
pcm, link_config and dai_driver to clients. This allows clients to fully
instantiate and track topology objects.

The SOF driver is the first user of these new APIs and needs them to build
component topology driver and FW objects.
