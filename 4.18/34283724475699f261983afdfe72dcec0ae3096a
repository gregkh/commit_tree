thermal: tegra: Nuke clk_{readl,writel} helpers

Naming driver-specific register accessors with generic
names, such as clk_writel and clk_readl, is bad.

Moreover, clk_writel and clk_readl are part of the
common clock framework api, so readers and code
grep'ers get confused by this collision.

The helpers are used once, so just remove them.
