dm: prevent DAX mounts if not supported

Currently device_supports_dax() just checks to see if the QUEUE_FLAG_DAX
flag is set on the device's request queue to decide whether or not the
device supports filesystem DAX.  Really we should be using
bdev_dax_supported() like filesystems do at mount time.  This performs
other tests like checking to make sure the dax_direct_access() path works.

We also explicitly clear QUEUE_FLAG_DAX on the DM device's request queue if
any of the underlying devices do not support DAX.  This makes the handling
of QUEUE_FLAG_DAX consistent with the setting/clearing of most other flags
in dm_table_set_restrictions().

Now that bdev_dax_supported() explicitly checks for QUEUE_FLAG_DAX, this
will ensure that filesystems built upon DM devices will only be able to
mount with DAX if all underlying devices also support DAX.
