EVM: fix memory leak of temporary buffer 'temp'

The allocation of 'temp' is not kfree'd and hence there is a memory
leak on each call of evm_read_xattrs.  Fix this by kfree'ing it
after copying data from it back to the user space buffer 'buf'.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1469386 ("Resource Leak")
