xfs: fetch dquots directly during quotacheck

Quotacheck only runs during mount, which means that there are no other
processes in the system that could be doing chown or chproj.  Therefore
there's no potential for racing to attach dquots to the inode so we can
drop all the ILOCK and race detection bits from quotacheck.
