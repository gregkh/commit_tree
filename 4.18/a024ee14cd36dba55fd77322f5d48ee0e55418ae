media: ov772x: correct setting of banding filter

The banding filter ON/OFF is controlled via bit 5 of COM8 register.  It
is attempted to be enabled in ov772x_set_params() by the following line.

	ret = ov772x_mask_set(client, COM8, BNDF_ON_OFF, 1);

But this unexpectedly results disabling the banding filter, because the
mask and set bits are exclusive.

On the other hand, ov772x_s_ctrl() correctly sets the bit by:

	ret = ov772x_mask_set(client, COM8, BNDF_ON_OFF, BNDF_ON_OFF);
