hwmon: (asus_atk0110) Replace deprecated device register call

Make the asus_atk0110 driver use hwmon_device_register_with_groups instead
of the deprecated hwmon_device_register.
Construct the expected attribute_group array from the sensor list which
contains all needed attributes.
Remove the manual sysfs file creation and deletion that are now taken care
of by the (un)register calls via the attribute_group array.
