mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: allow 1.8V modes without 100/200MHz pinctrl states

If pinctrl nodes for 100/200MHz are missing, the controller should
not select any mode which need signal frequencies 100MHz or higher.
To prevent such speed modes the driver currently uses the quirk flag
SDHCI_QUIRK2_NO_1_8_V. This works nicely for SD cards since 1.8V
signaling is required for all faster modes and slower modes use 3.3V
signaling only.

However, there are eMMC modes which use 1.8V signaling and run below
100MHz, e.g. DDR52 at 1.8V. With using SDHCI_QUIRK2_NO_1_8_V this
mode is prevented. When using a fixed 1.8V regulator as vqmmc-supply
the stack has no valid mode to use. In this tenuous situation the
kernel continuously prints voltage switching errors:
  mmc1: Switching to 3.3V signalling voltage failed

Avoid using SDHCI_QUIRK2_NO_1_8_V and prevent faster modes by
altering the SDHCI capability register. With that the stack is able
to select 1.8V modes even if no faster pinctrl states are available:
  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/mmc1/ios
  ...
  timing spec:    8 (mmc DDR52)
  signal voltage: 1 (1.80 V)
  ...
