gpio: pca953x: Clear irq trigger type on irq shutdown

The driver stores the result of irq_set_type() in the internal variables
irq_trig_raise and irq_trig_fall, which later are used to determine
the GPIOs that must be re-configured as input. These variables retain their
value between gpiolib's  export / unexport, resulting in an incorrect
state in some cases. The corresponding bits in the variables
irq_trig_raise and irq_trig_fall should be cleared in irq_shutdown().
