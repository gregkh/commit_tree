vt: Perform safe console erase only once

Commit f8df13e0a9 ("tty: Clean console safely") added code to clear
both the scrollback buffer and the screen with "\e[3J", then execution
falls through into the code to simply clear the screen. This means
scr_memsetw() and the console driver update callback are called twice
on the whole screen buffer. Let's reorganize the code so the same work
is not performed twice needlessly.
