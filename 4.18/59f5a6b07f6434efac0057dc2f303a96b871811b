tpm: reduce poll sleep time in tpm_transmit()

tpm_try_transmit currently checks TPM status every 5 msecs between
send and recv. It does so in a loop for the maximum timeout as defined
in the TPM Interface Specification. However, the TPM may return before
5 msecs. Thus the polling interval for each iteration can be reduced,
which improves overall performance. This patch changes the polling sleep
time from 5 msecs to 1 msec.

Additionally, this patch renames TPM_POLL_SLEEP to TPM_TIMEOUT_POLL and
moves it to tpm.h as an enum value.

After this change, performance on a system[1] with a TPM 1.2 with an 8 byte
burstcount for 1000 extends improved from ~14 sec to ~10.7 sec.

[1] All tests are performed on an x86 based, locked down, single purpose
closed system. It has Infineon TPM 1.2 using LPC Bus.
