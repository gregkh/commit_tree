x86/fault: Dump user opcode bytes on fatal faults

Sometimes it is useful to see which user opcode bytes RIP points to
when a fault happens: be it to rule out RIP corruption, to dump info
early during boot, when doing core dumps is impossible due to not having
a writable filesystem yet.

Sometimes it is useful if debugging an issue and one doesn't have access
to the executable which caused the fault in order to disassemble it.

That last aspect might have some security implications so
show_unhandled_signals could be revisited for that or a new config option
added.
