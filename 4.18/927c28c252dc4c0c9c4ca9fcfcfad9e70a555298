m68k: setup PCI support code in io_no.h

Ultimately we want the ColdFire IO access support to be consisent no matter
whether it is configured with MMU enabled or disabled. To acheive that we
need to get all the ColdFire IO access support code together in one place,
in this case io_no.h. The last big piece not in io_no.h is the PCI bus
support functions.

Define the IO mapping addresses required to use the asm-generic IO
access functions. They can provide everything we need - no need for us
to duplicate or have local in/out or read/write access functions.
Note that this support is not active yet, since we haven't done the
full switch over to using the asm-generic functions yet. And also note
that we do not yet remove the old PCI functions from io_mm.h yet.

Consolodating all this IO access support in a single place will make
it easier in the future to enable PCI bus support for non-MMU enabled
ColdFire (which we currently cannot do).
