net: hns3: Updates RX packet info fetch in case of multi BD

In the latest revision of the hardware, if a packet is spanning
across multiple BDs then only VLD bit and current data size info
is valid in each BD, and rest of the information is only valid
in the last BD of the packet. In such case we should make sure
we are fetching RX packet size from the first descriptor and
information like VLAN should be fetched from last BD.
