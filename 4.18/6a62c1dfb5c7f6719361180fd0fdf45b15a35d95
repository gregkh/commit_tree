vfio/mdev: Re-order sysfs attribute creation

There exists a gap at the end of mdev_device_create() where the device
is visible to userspace, but we're not yet ready to handle removal, as
triggered through the 'remove' attribute.  We handle this properly in
mdev_device_remove() with an -EAGAIN return, but we can marginally
reduce this gap by adding this attribute as a final step of our sysfs
setup.
