drm/i915: Add control flags to i915_handle_error()

Not all callers want the GPU error to handled in the same way, so expose
a control parameter. In the first instance, some callers do not want the
heavyweight error capture so add a bit to request the state to be
captured and saved.

v2: Pass msg down to i915_reset/i915_reset_engine so that we include the
reason for the reset in the dev_notice(), superseding the earlier option
to not print that notice.
v3: Stash the reason inside the i915->gpu_error to handover to the direct
reset from the blocking waiter.
