drm/edid: Use drm_mode_match_no_clocks_no_stereo() for consistentcy

Use drm_mode_equal_no_clocks_no_stereo() in
drm_match_hdmi_mode_clock_tolerance() for consistency as we
also use it in drm_match_hdmi_mode() and the cea mode matching
functions.

This doesn't actually change anything since the input mode
comes from detailed timings and we match it against
edid_4k_modes[] which. So none of those modes can have stereo
flags set.
