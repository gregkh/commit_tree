media: rcar-vin: move model information to own struct

When Gen3 support is added to the driver more than model ID will be
different for the different SoCs. To avoid a lot of if statements in the
code create a struct rvin_info to store this information.

While we are at it rename the poorly chosen enum which contains the
different model IDs from chip_id to model_id. Also sort the compatible
string entries and make use of of_device_get_match_data() which will
always work as the driver is DT only, so there's always a valid match.
