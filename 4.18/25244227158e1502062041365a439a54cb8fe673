usb: hub: Per-port setting to use old enumeration scheme

The "old" enumeration scheme is considerably faster (it takes
~244ms instead of ~356ms to get the descriptor).

It is currently only possible to use the old scheme globally
(/sys/module/usbcore/parameters/old_scheme_first), which is not
desirable as the new scheme was introduced to increase compatibility
with more devices.

However, in our case, we care about time-to-active for a specific
USB device (which we make the firmware for), on a specific port
(that is pogo-pin based: not a standard USB port). This new
sysfs option makes it possible to use the old scheme on a single
port only.
