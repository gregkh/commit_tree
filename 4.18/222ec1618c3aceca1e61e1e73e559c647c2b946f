drm: Add aspect ratio parsing in DRM layer

Current DRM layer functions don't parse aspect ratio information
while converting a user mode->kernel mode or vice versa. This
causes modeset to pick mode with wrong aspect ratio, eventually
causing failures in HDMI compliance test cases, due to wrong VIC.

This patch adds aspect ratio information in DRM's mode conversion
and mode comparision functions, to make sure kernel picks mode
with right aspect ratio (as per the VIC).

Background:
This patch was once reviewed and merged, and later reverted due to
lack of DRM cap protection. This is a re-spin of this patch, this
time with DRM cap protection, to avoid aspect ratio information, when
the client doesn't request for it.
