bpf: btf: Ensure the member->offset is in the right order

This patch ensures the member->offset of a struct
is in the correct order (i.e the later member's offset cannot
go backward).

The current "pahole -J" BTF encoder does not generate something
like this.  However, checking this can ensure future encoder
will not violate this.
