iomap: fsync swap files before iterating mappings

Swap files require that all the file mapping metadata be stable on disk.
It is insufficient to flush dirty pages in the page cache because that
won't necessarily result in filesystems pushing all their metadata out
to disk.  Therefore, call fsync from iomap_swapfile_activate.
