netfilter: fix fallout from xt/nf osf separation

Stephen Rothwell says:
  today's linux-next build (x86_64 allmodconfig) produced this warning:
  ./usr/include/linux/netfilter/nf_osf.h:25: found __[us]{8,16,32,64} type without #include <linux/types.h>

Fix that up and also move kernel-private struct out of uapi (it was not
exposed in any released kernel version).

tested via allmodconfig build + make headers_check.
