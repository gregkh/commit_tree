pinctrl: mt7622: fix initialization sequence between eint and gpiochip

Because gpichip applied in the driver must depend on mtk eint to implement
the input data debouncing and the translation between gpio and irq, it's
better to keep logic consistent with mtk eint being built prior to gpiochip
being added.
