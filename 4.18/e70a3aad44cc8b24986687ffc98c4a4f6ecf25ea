ipv6: fix double refcount of fib6_metrics

All the callers of ip6_rt_copy_init()/rt6_set_from() hold refcnt
of the "from" fib6_info, so there is no need to hold fib6_metrics
refcnt again, because fib6_metrics refcnt is only released when
fib6_info is gone, that is, they have the same life time, so the
whole fib6_metrics refcnt can be removed actually.

This fixes a kmemleak warning reported by Sabrina.
