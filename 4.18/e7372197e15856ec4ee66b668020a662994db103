net/ipv4: Set oif in fib_compute_spec_dst

Xin reported that icmp replies may not use the address on the device the
echo request is received if the destination address is broadcast. Instead
a route lookup is done without considering VRF context. Fix by setting
oif in flow struct to the master device if it is enslaved. That directs
the lookup to the VRF table. If the device is not enslaved, oif is still
0 so no affect.

Fixes: cd2fbe1b6b51 ("net: Use VRF device index for lookups on RX")
