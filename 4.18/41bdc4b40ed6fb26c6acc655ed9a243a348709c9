bpf: introduce bpf subcommand BPF_TASK_FD_QUERY

Currently, suppose a userspace application has loaded a bpf program
and attached it to a tracepoint/kprobe/uprobe, and a bpf
introspection tool, e.g., bpftool, wants to show which bpf program
is attached to which tracepoint/kprobe/uprobe. Such attachment
information will be really useful to understand the overall bpf
deployment in the system.

There is a name field (16 bytes) for each program, which could
be used to encode the attachment point. There are some drawbacks
for this approaches. First, bpftool user (e.g., an admin) may not
really understand the association between the name and the
attachment point. Second, if one program is attached to multiple
places, encoding a proper name which can imply all these
attachments becomes difficult.

This patch introduces a new bpf subcommand BPF_TASK_FD_QUERY.
Given a pid and fd, if the <pid, fd> is associated with a
tracepoint/kprobe/uprobe perf event, BPF_TASK_FD_QUERY will return
   . prog_id
   . tracepoint name, or
   . k[ret]probe funcname + offset or kernel addr, or
   . u[ret]probe filename + offset
to the userspace.
The user can use "bpftool prog" to find more information about
bpf program itself with prog_id.
