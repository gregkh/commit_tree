platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: silence false-positive-prone pr_warn

Do not consider unknown HKEY events in the 0x6000 range to be thermal
warnings.  Instead, handle them as a generic unknown HKEY event, which
are reported to the kernel log at priority "notice", and do not trigger
a thermal registers state dump to the log.
