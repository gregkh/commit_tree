arm64: defconfig: Enable CONFIG_PINCTRL_MT7622 by default

Recently kernelCI reported the board mt7622-rfb1 has a fail test with
kernel: ERROR: did not start booting whose details could be seen at [1].

The cause is that UART0 can't output anything when it's missing a proper
pin setup with current DTS, so the essential driver is always getting
enabled to fix up the issue.
