drm/i915/selftests: Rename wait_for_hang() to wait_until_running()

Tvrtko mentioned that wait_for_hang() was confusing as it does not
actually wait for the aforementioned hang, just until the request is
running and we are *ready* to inject a hang. A quick
s/wait_for_hang/wait_until_running/ removes that confusion without
having to rethink the naming scheme, immediately at least.
