staging: ks7010: assign dev_alloc_name() result to variable before check it

This commit assigns dev_alloc_name() call to 'ret' variable to
check it after instead of check directly the call in the if
condition. This improves a bit readability. It also add an empty
line before the new assignment to separate it from the previous
check statement block.
