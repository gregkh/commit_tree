tcp: Add mark for TIMEWAIT sockets

This version has some suggestions by Eric Dumazet:

- Use a local variable for the mark in IPv6 instead of ctl_sk to avoid SMP
races.
- Use the more elegant "IP4_REPLY_MARK(net, skb->mark) ?: sk->sk_mark"
statement.
- Factorize code as sk_fullsock() check is not necessary.

Aidan McGurn from Openwave Mobility systems reported the following bug:

"Marked routing is broken on customer deployment. Its effects are large
increase in Uplink retransmissions caused by the client never receiving
the final ACK to their FINACK - this ACK misses the mark and routes out
of the incorrect route."

Currently marks are added to sk_buffs for replies when the "fwmark_reflect"
sysctl is enabled. But not for TW sockets that had sk->sk_mark set via
setsockopt(SO_MARK..).

Fix this in IPv4/v6 by adding tw->tw_mark for TIME_WAIT sockets. Copy the the
original sk->sk_mark in __inet_twsk_hashdance() to the new tw->tw_mark location.
Then progate this so that the skb gets sent with the correct mark. Do the same
for resets. Give the "fwmark_reflect" sysctl precedence over sk->sk_mark so that
netfilter rules are still honored.
