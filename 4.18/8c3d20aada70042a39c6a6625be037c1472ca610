scsi: zfcp: fix missing REC trigger trace for all objects in ERP_FAILED

That other commit introduced an inconsistency because it would trace on
ERP_FAILED for all callers of port forced reopen triggers (not just
terminate_rport_io), but it would not trace on ERP_FAILED for all callers of
other ERP triggers such as adapter, port regular, LUN.

Therefore, generalize that other commit. zfcp_erp_action_enqueue() already
had two early outs which re-used the one zfcp_dbf_rec_trig() call.  All ERP
trigger functions finally run through zfcp_erp_action_enqueue().  So move
the special handling for ZFCP_STATUS_COMMON_ERP_FAILED into
zfcp_erp_action_enqueue() and add another early out with new trace marker
for pseudo ERP need in this case. This removes all early returns from all
ERP trigger functions so we always end up at zfcp_dbf_rec_trig().

Example trace record formatted with zfcpdbf from s390-tools:

Timestamp      : ...

Subarea        : 00
