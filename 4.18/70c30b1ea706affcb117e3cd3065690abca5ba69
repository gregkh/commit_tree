media: rc: nuvoton: Tweak the interrupt enabling dance

It appears that we need to enable CIR device before attempting to touch
some of the registers. Previously, this was not a big issue, since we
were rarely seeing nvt_close() getting called.

Unfortunately, since commit cb84343fced1 ("media: lirc: do not call close()
or open() on unregistered devices") the initial open() during probe from
rc_setup_rx_device() is no longer successful, which means that userspace
clients will actually end up calling nvt_open()/nvt_close(). Since
nvt_open() is broken, the device doesn't seem to work as expected.
