netfilter: ipvs: Add Maglev hashing scheduler

Implements the Google's Maglev hashing algorithm as a IPVS scheduler.

Basically it provides consistent hashing but offers some special
features about disruption and load balancing.

 1) minimal disruption: when the set of destinations changes,
    a connection will likely be sent to the same destination
    as it was before.

 2) load balancing: each destination will receive an almost
    equal number of connections.
