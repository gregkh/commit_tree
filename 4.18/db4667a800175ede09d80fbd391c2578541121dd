ARM: 8768/1: uaccess: remove const to avoid duplicate specifier

Some users of get_user use the macro with an argument p which
is already specified as static. When using clang this leads to
a duplicate specifier:

          specifier [-Wduplicate-decl-specifier]
          if (get_user(tmp, &termio->c_iflag) < 0)
              ^
  ./arch/arm/include/asm/uaccess.h:195:3: note: expanded from macro 'get_user'
                  __get_user_check(x, p);
                  ^
  ./arch/arm/include/asm/uaccess.h:155:12: note: expanded from macro
          '__get_user_check'
                  register const typeof(*(p)) __user *__p asm("r0") = (p);

Remove the const attribute from the register declaration
to avoid the duplicate const specifier. In a test with ptrace.c
and traps.c (both using get_user with non-const arguments for p)
the generated code was exactly the same.
