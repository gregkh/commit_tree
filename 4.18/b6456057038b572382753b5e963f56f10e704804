spi: bcm-qspi: Fix build failure caused by spi_flash_read() API removal

Patch http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/905205/ has been partially
applied, and changes to the bcm-qspi driver have been lost somehow
(probably due to a conflict when applying the patch).

Remove the ->spi_flash_read() bits from this driver to fix the build
error.
