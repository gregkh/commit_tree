bpf: allow sk_msg programs to read sock fields

Currently sk_msg programs only have access to the raw data. However,
it is often useful when building policies to have the policies specific
to the socket endpoint. This allows using the socket tuple as input
into filters, etc.

This patch adds ctx access to the sock fields.
