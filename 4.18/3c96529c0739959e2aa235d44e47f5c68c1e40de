tracing: Add __find_event_file() to find event files without restrictions

By adding the function __find_event_file() that can search for files without
restrictions, such as if the event associated with the file has a reg
function, or if it has the "ignore" flag set, the files that are associated
to ftrace internal events (like trace_marker and function events) can be
found and used.

find_event_file() still returns a "filtered" file, as most callers need a
valid trace event file. One created by the trace_events.h macros and not one
created for parsing ftrace specific events.
