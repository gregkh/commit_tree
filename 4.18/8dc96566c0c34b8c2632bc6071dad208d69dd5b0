NFSv4/pnfs: Don't switch off layoutget-on-open for transient errors

Ensure that we only switch off the LAYOUTGET operation in the OPEN
compound when the server is truly broken, and/or it is complaining
that the compound is too large.
Currently, we end up turning off the functionality permanently,
even for transient errors such as EACCES or ENOSPC.
