drm/i915: Disable some extra clang warnings

Commit 39bf4de89ff7 ("drm/i915: Add -Wall -Wextra to our build, set
warnings to full") enabled extra warnings for i915 to spot possible
bugs in new code, and then disabled a subset of these warnings to keep
the current code building without warnings (with gcc). Enabling the
extra warnings also enabled some additional clang-only warnings, as a
result building i915 with clang currently is extremely noisy. For now
also disable the clang warnings sign-compare, sometimes-uninitialized,
unneeded-internal-declaration and initializer-overrides. If desired
they can be re-enabled after the code has been fixed.
