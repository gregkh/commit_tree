tracing: Add brackets in ftrace event dynamic arrays

The dynamic arrays defined for ftrace internal events, such as the buf field
for trace_marker (ftrace/print) did not have brackets which makes the filter
code not accept it as a string. This is not currently an issues because the
filter code doesn't do anything for these events, but they will in the
future, and this needs to be fixed for when it does.
