drm/i915/breadcrumbs: Keep the fake irq armed across reset

Instead of synchronously cancelling the timer and re-enabling it inside
the reset callbacks, keep the timer enabled and let it die on its next
wakeup if no longer required. This allows
intel_engine_reset_breadcrumbs() to be used from an atomic
(timer/softirq) context such as required for resetting an engine.

It also allows us to react better to the user poking around debugfs for
testing missed irqs.

v2: Tighten the order of del_timer_sync as the fake_irq timer
may trigger the hangcheck timer, and so we should cancel it first and
then cancel the hangcheck (Mika)
