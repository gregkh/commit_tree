ipv4/igmp: init group mode as INCLUDE when join source group

Based on RFC3376 5.1
   If no interface
   state existed for that multicast address before the change (i.e., the
   change consisted of creating a new per-interface record), or if no
   state exists after the change (i.e., the change consisted of deleting
   a per-interface record), then the "non-existent" state is considered
   to have a filter mode of INCLUDE and an empty source list.

Which means a new multicast group should start with state IN().

Function ip_mc_join_group() works correctly for IGMP ASM(Any-Source Multicast)
mode. It adds a group with state EX() and inits crcount to mc_qrv,
so the kernel will send a TO_EX() report message after adding group.

But for IGMPv3 SSM(Source-specific multicast) JOIN_SOURCE_GROUP mode, we
split the group joining into two steps. First we join the group like ASM,
i.e. via ip_mc_join_group(). So the state changes from IN() to EX().

Then we add the source-specific address with INCLUDE mode. So the state
changes from EX() to IN(A).

Before the first step sends a group change record, we finished the second
step. So we will only send the second change record. i.e. TO_IN(A).

Regarding the RFC stands, we should actually send an ALLOW(A) message for
SSM JOIN_SOURCE_GROUP as the state should mimic the 'IN() to IN(A)'
transition.

The issue was exposed by commit a052517a8ff65 ("net/multicast: should not
send source list records when have filter mode change"). Before this change,
we used to send both ALLOW(A) and TO_IN(A). After this change we only send
TO_IN(A).

Fix it by adding a new parameter to init group mode. Also add new wrapper
functions so we don't need to change too much code.

v1 -> v2:
In my first version I only cleared the group change record. But this is not
enough. Because when a new group join, it will init as EXCLUDE and trigger
an filter mode change in ip/ip6_mc_add_src(), which will clear all source
addresses' sf_crcount. This will prevent early joined address sending state
change records if multi source addressed joined at the same time.

In v2 patch, I fixed it by directly initializing the mode to INCLUDE for SSM
JOIN_SOURCE_GROUP. I also split the original patch into two separated patches
for IPv4 and IPv6.
