kvm: nVMX: Eliminate APIC access page sharing between L1 and L2

It is only possible to share the APIC access page between L1 and L2 if
they also share the virtual-APIC page.  If L2 has its own virtual-APIC
page, then MMIO accesses to L1's TPR from L2 will access L2's TPR
instead.  Moreover, L1's local APIC has to be in xAPIC mode, which is
another condition that hasn't been checked.
