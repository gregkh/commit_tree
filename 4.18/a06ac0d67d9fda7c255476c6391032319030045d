Revert "net: init sk_cookie for inet socket"

This reverts commit <c6849a3ac17e> ("net: init sk_cookie for inet socket")

Per discussion with Eric, when update sock_net(sk)->cookie_gen, the
whole cache cache line will be invalidated, as this cache line is shared
with all cpus, that may cause great performace hit.

Bellow is the data form Eric.
"Performance is reduced from ~5 Mpps to ~3.8 Mpps with 16 RX queues on
my host" when running synflood test.

Have to revert it to prevent from cache line false sharing.
