Squashfs: Compute expected length from inode size rather than block length

Previously in squashfs_readpage() when copying data into the page
cache, it used the length of the datablock read from the filesystem
(after decompression).  However, if the filesystem has been corrupted
this data block may be short, which will leave pages unfilled.

The fix for this is to compute the expected number of bytes to copy
from the inode size, and use this to detect if the block is short.
