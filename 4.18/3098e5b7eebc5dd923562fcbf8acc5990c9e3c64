drm: rcar-du: disable dtc graph-endpoint warnings on DT overlays

The rcar DT overlays are missing symetrical remote-endpoint properties
in their graph nodes because the remote-endpoint is fixed up at
run-time. Disable the dtc 'graph-endpoint' warnings when compiling these
overlays. If this becomes a common problem for overlays, then perhaps
this check needs to be disabled for all overlays.
