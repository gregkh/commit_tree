media: omap3isp: Enable driver compilation on ARM with COMPILE_TEST

The omap3isp driver can't be compiled on non-ARM platforms but has no
compile-time dependency on OMAP. It however requires common clock
framework support, which isn't provided by all ARM platforms.

Drop the OMAP dependency when COMPILE_TEST is set and add ARM and
COMMON_CLK dependencies.
