mips: ftrace: fix static function graph tracing

ftrace_graph_caller was never run after calling ftrace_trace_function,
breaking the function graph tracer. Fix this, bringing it in line with the
x86 implementation.

While we're at it, also streamline the control flow of _mcount a bit to
reduce the number of branches.
