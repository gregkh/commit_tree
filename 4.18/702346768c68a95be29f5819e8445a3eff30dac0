powerpc/mm/nohash: Remove pte fragment dependency from nohash

Now that we have removed 64K page size support, the RCU page table free can
be much simpler for nohash. Make a copy of the the rcu callback to pgalloc.h
header similar to nohash 32. We could possibly merge 32 and 64 bit there. But
that is for a later patch

We also move the book3s specific handler to pgtable_book3s64.c. This will be
updated in a later patch to handle split pmd ptlock.
