include/linux/eventfd.h: include linux/errno.h

The new gasket staging driver ran into a randconfig build failure when
CONFIG_EVENTFD is disabled:

  In file included from drivers/staging/gasket/gasket_interrupt.h:11,
                   from drivers/staging/gasket/gasket_interrupt.c:4:
  include/linux/eventfd.h: In function 'eventfd_ctx_fdget':
  include/linux/eventfd.h:51:9: error: implicit declaration of function 'ERR_PTR' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

I can't see anything wrong with including eventfd.h before err.h, so the
easiest fix is to make it possible to do this by including the file
where it is needed.
