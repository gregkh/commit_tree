net: hns3: Change return type of hnae3_register_ae_algo

The ae_algo is used by many ae_devs. It is not only belong to just a
ae_dev. Initializing ae_dev failed does not represent registering ae_algo
failed. Because the action of registering ae_algo just is adding ae_algo
to the ae_algo list and it is always is true, it make no sense to define
return type as int.

This patch changes the return type of hnae3_register_ae_algo from int to
void.
