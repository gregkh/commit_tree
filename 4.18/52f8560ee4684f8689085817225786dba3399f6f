r8169: fix network error on resume from suspend

This commit removed calls to rtl_set_rx_mode(). This is ok for the
standard path if the link is brought up, however it breaks system
resume from suspend. Link comes up but no network traffic.

Meanwhile common code from rtl_hw_start_8169/8101/8168() was moved
to rtl_hw_start(), therefore re-add the call to rtl_set_rx_mode()
there.

Due to adding this call we have to move definition of rtl_hw_start()
after definition of rtl_set_rx_mode().
