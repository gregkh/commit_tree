KVM: arm64: Repurpose vcpu_arch.debug_flags for general-purpose flags

In struct vcpu_arch, the debug_flags field is used to store
debug-related flags about the vcpu state.

Since we are about to add some more flags related to FPSIMD and
SVE, it makes sense to add them to the existing flags field rather
than adding new fields.  Since there is only one debug_flags flag
defined so far, there is plenty of free space for expansion.

In preparation for adding more flags, this patch renames the
debug_flags field to simply "flags", and updates comments
appropriately.

The flag definitions are also moved to <asm/kvm_host.h>, since
their presence in <asm/kvm_asm.h> was for purely historical
reasons:  these definitions are not used from asm any more, and not
very likely to be as more Hyp asm is migrated to C.

KVM_ARM64_DEBUG_DIRTY_SHIFT has not been used since commit
1ea66d27e7b0 ("arm64: KVM: Move away from the assembly version of
the world switch"), so this patch gets rid of that too.

No functional change.
