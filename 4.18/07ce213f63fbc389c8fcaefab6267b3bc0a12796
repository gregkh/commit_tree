nbd: set discard_alignment to the granularity

Technically we should be able to get away with 0 as the
discard_alignment, but there's no way currently for the protocol to
indicate different alignments, and in real life most disks have
discard_alignment == discard_granularity.  Just set our alignment to our
blocksize to make sure discards will actually work properly with 4k
drives.
