gpiolib: add hogs support for machine code

Board files constitute a significant part of the users of the legacy
GPIO framework. In many cases they only export a line and set its
desired value. We could use GPIO hogs for that like we do for DT and
ACPI but there's no support for that in machine code.

This patch proposes to extend the machine.h API with support for
registering hog tables in board files.
