xfs: move generic_write_sync calls inwards

To prepare for iomap iinfrastructure based DSYNC optimisations.

While moving the code araound, move the XFS write bytes metric
update for direct IO into xfs_dio_write_end_io callback so that we
always capture the amount of data written via AIO+DIO. This fixes
the problem where queued AIO+DIO writes are not accounted to this
metric.
