bnx2x: Fix receiving tx-timeout in error or recovery state.

Driver performs the internal reload when it receives tx-timeout event from
the OS. Internal reload might fail in some scenarios e.g., fatal HW issues.
In such cases OS still see the link, which would result in undesirable
functionalities such as re-generation of tx-timeouts.
The patch addresses this issue by indicating the link-down to OS when
tx-timeout is detected, and keeping the link in down state till the
internal reload is successful.

Please consider applying it to 'net' branch.
