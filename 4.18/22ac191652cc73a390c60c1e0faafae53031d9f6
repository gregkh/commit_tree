Bluetooth: btbcm: Allow using btbcm_initialize() for reinit

btbcm_finalize() does a re-init of the controller, which is almost the
same as the initial init. Modify btbcm_initialize() so that it can be
used for this re-init and modify btbcm_finalize() to use it.

As an added bonus this also makes the dev_info from btbcm_finalize()
use the proper hw_name instead of always printing "BCM".
