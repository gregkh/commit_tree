thermal: imx: add i.MX7 thermal sensor support

This patch adds i.MX7 thermal sensor support, most
of the i.MX7 thermal sensor functions are same with
i.MX6 except the registers offset/layout, so we move
those registers offset/layout definitions to soc data
structure.

i.MX7 uses single calibration data @25C, the calibration
data is located at OCOTP offset 0x4F0, bit[17:9], the
formula is as below:

Tmeas = (Nmeas - n1) + 25; n1 is the fuse value for 25C.
