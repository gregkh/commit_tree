regulator: fixed: Convert to use GPIO descriptor only

As we augmented the regulator core to accept a GPIO descriptor instead
of a GPIO number, we can augment the fixed GPIO regulator to look up
and pass that descriptor directly from device tree or board GPIO
descriptor look up tables.

Some boards just auto-enumerate their fixed regulator platform devices
and I have assumed they get names like "fixed-regulator.0" but it's
pretty hard to guess this. I need some testing from board maintainers to
be sure. Other boards are straight forward, using just plain
"fixed-regulator" (ID -1) or "fixed-regulator.1" hammering down the
device ID.

The OMAP didn't have proper label names on its GPIO chips so I have fixed
this with a separate patch to the GPIO tree, see
commit 088413bc0bd5f5fb66ca22a19d66a49d7154ba4c
"gpio: omap: Give unique labels to each GPIO bank/chip"

It seems the da9055 and da9211 has never got around to actually passing
any enable gpio into its platform data (not the in-tree code anyway) so we
can just decide to simply pass a descriptor instead.

The fixed GPIO-controlled regulator in mach-pxa/ezx.c was confusingly named
"*_dummy_supply_device" while it is a very real device backed by a GPIO
line. There is nothing dummy about it at all, so I renamed it with the
infix *_regulator_* as part of this patch set.

For the patch hunk hitting arch/blackfin I would say I do not expect
testing, review or ACKs anymore so if it works, it works.

The hunk hitting the x86 BCM43xx driver is especially tricky as the number
comes out of SFI which is a mystery to me. I definately need someone to
look at this. (Hi Andy.)
