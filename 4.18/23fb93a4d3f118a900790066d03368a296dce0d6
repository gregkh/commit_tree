net/ipv6: Cleanup exception and cache route handling

IPv6 FIB will only contain FIB entries with exception routes added to
the FIB entry. Once this transformation is complete, FIB lookups will
return a fib6_info with the lookup functions still returning a dst
based rt6_info. The current code uses rt6_info for both paths and
overloads the rt6_info variable usually called 'rt'.

This patch introduces a new 'f6i' variable name for the result of the FIB
lookup and keeps 'rt' as the dst based return variable. 'f6i' becomes a
fib6_info in a later patch which is why it is introduced as f6i now;
avoids the additional churn in the later patch.

In addition, remove RTF_CACHE and dst checks from fib6 add and delete
since they can not happen now and will never happen after the data
type flip.
