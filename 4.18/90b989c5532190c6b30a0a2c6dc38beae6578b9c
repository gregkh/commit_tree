r8169: improve rtl8169_get_mac_version

Certain entries in array mac_info[] are redundant, so remove them:
0x7cf, 0x2c200000 (VER 33): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x2c000000
0x7cf, 0x28300000 (VER 26): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x28000000
0x7cf, 0x3cb00000 (VER 24): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x3c800000
0x7cf, 0x3c400000 (VER 22): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x3c000000
0x7cf, 0x38500000 (VER 17): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x38000000
0x7cf, 0x44900000 (VER 39): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x44800000
0x7cf, 0x40b00000 (VER 30): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x40800000
0x7cf, 0x40a00000 (VER 30): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x40800000
0x7cf, 0x34a00000 (VER 09): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x34800000
0x7cf, 0x24a00000 (VER 09): matched by entry 0x7c8, 0x24800000

In addition don't mask out bits 30 and 29 when printing the XID.
Most likely this is a relict from the times when the driver covered
RTL8169 chip version only.
