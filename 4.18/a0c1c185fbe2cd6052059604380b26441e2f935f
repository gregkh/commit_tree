scsi: aacraid: remove bogus GFP_DMA32 specifies

For one GFP_DMA32 does not actually work with kmalloc, as we only have
GFP_DMA and GFP_KERNEL caches, but not GFP_DMA32.  Second the memory
is mapped using the proper DMA API anyway, which would include proper
bounce buffering if needed by the device.
