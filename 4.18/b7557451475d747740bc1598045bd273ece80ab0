KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Lockless tlbie for HPT hcalls

tlbies to an LPAR do not have to be serialised since POWER4/PPC970,
after which the MMU_FTR_LOCKLESS_TLBIE feature was introduced to
avoid tlbie locking.

Since commit c17b98cf6028 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Remove code for
PPC970 processors"), KVM no longer supports processors that do not
have this feature, so the tlbie locking can be removed completely.
A sanity check for the feature is put in kvmppc_mmu_hv_init.

Testing was done on a POWER9 system in HPT mode, with a -smp 32 guest
in HPT mode. 32 instances of the powerpc fork benchmark from selftests
were run with --fork, and the results measured.

Without this patch, total throughput was about 13.5K/sec, and this is
the top of the host profile:

   74.52%  [k] do_tlbies
    2.95%  [k] kvmppc_book3s_hv_page_fault
    1.80%  [k] calc_checksum
    1.80%  [k] kvmppc_vcpu_run_hv
    1.49%  [k] kvmppc_run_core

After this patch, throughput was about 51K/sec, with this profile:

   21.28%  [k] do_tlbies
    5.26%  [k] kvmppc_run_core
    4.88%  [k] kvmppc_book3s_hv_page_fault
    3.30%  [k] _raw_spin_lock_irqsave
    3.25%  [k] gup_pgd_range
