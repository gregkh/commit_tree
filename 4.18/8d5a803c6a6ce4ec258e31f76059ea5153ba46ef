ext4: check for allocation block validity with block group locked

With commit 044e6e3d74a3: "ext4: don't update checksum of new
initialized bitmaps" the buffer valid bit will get set without
actually setting up the checksum for the allocation bitmap, since the
checksum will get calculated once we actually allocate an inode or
block.

If we are doing this, then we need to (re-)check the verified bit
after we take the block group lock.  Otherwise, we could race with
another process reading and verifying the bitmap, which would then
complain about the checksum being invalid.
