KVM: x86: VMX: hyper-v: Enlightened MSR-Bitmap support

Enlightened MSR-Bitmap is a natural extension of Enlightened VMCS:
Hyper-V Top Level Functional Specification states:

"The L1 hypervisor may collaborate with the L0 hypervisor to make MSR
accesses more efficient. It can enable enlightened MSR bitmaps by setting
the corresponding field in the enlightened VMCS to 1. When enabled, the L0
hypervisor does not monitor the MSR bitmaps for changes. Instead, the L1
hypervisor must invalidate the corresponding clean field after making
changes to one of the MSR bitmaps."

I reached out to Hyper-V team for additional details and I got the
following information:

"Current Hyper-V implementation works as following:

If the enlightened MSR bitmap is not enabled:
- All MSR accesses of L2 guests cause physical VM-Exits

If the enlightened MSR bitmap is enabled:
- Physical VM-Exits for L2 accesses to certain MSRs (currently FS_BASE,
  GS_BASE and KERNEL_GS_BASE) are avoided, thus making these MSR accesses
  faster."

I tested my series with a tight rdmsrl loop in L2, for KERNEL_GS_BASE the
results are:

Without Enlightened MSR-Bitmap: 1300 cycles/read
With Enlightened MSR-Bitmap: 120 cycles/read
