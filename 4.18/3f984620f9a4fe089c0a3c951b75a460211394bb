powerpc: generic clockevents broadcast receiver call tick_receive_broadcast

The broadcast tick recipient can call tick_receive_broadcast rather
than re-running the full timer interrupt.

It does not have to check for the next event time, because the sender
already determined the timer has expired. It does not have to test
irq_work_pending, because that's a direct decrementer interrupt and
does not go through the clock events subsystem. And it does not have
to read PURR because that was removed with the previous patch.

This results in no code size change, but both the decrementer and
broadcast path lengths are reduced.
