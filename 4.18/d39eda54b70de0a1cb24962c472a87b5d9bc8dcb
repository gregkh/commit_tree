scsi: zfcp: consistently use function name space prefix

I've been mixing up
zfcp_task_mgmt_function() [SCSI] and
zfcp_fsf_fcp_task_mgmt()  [FSF]
so often lately that I wanted to fix this.

SCSI changes complement v2.6.27 commit f76af7d7e363 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Cleanup
of code in zfcp_scsi.c").

While at it, also fixup the other inconsistencies elsewhere.

ERP changes complement v2.6.27 commit 287ac01acf22 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Cleanup
code in zfcp_erp.c") which introduced status_change_set().

FC changes complement v2.6.32 commit 6f53a2d2ecae ("[SCSI] zfcp: Apply
common naming conventions to zfcp_fc").  by renaming a leftover introduced
with v2.6.27 commit cc8c282963bd ("[SCSI] zfcp: Automatically attach remote
ports").

FSF changes fixup v2.6.32 commit a4623c467ff7 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Improve request
allocation through mempools").  which replaced zfcp_fsf_alloc_qtcb()
introduced with v2.6.27 commit c41f8cbddd4e ("[SCSI] zfcp: zfcp_fsf
cleanup.").

SCSI fc_host statistics were introduced with v2.6.16 commit f6cd94b126aa
("[SCSI] zfcp: transport class adaptations").

SCSI fc_host port_state was introduced with v2.6.27 commit 85a82392fe6f
("[SCSI] zfcp: Add port_state attribute to sysfs").

SCSI rport setter for dev_loss_tmo was introduced with v2.6.18 commit
338151e06608 ("[SCSI] zfcp: make use of fc_remote_port_delete when target
port is unavailable").
