mfd: mt6397: Create irq mappings in mfd core driver

The core driver should create and manage irq mappings instead of
leaf drivers. This patch change to pass irq domain to
devm_mfd_add_devices() and it will create mapping for irq resources
automatically. And remove irq mapping in rtc driver since this has
been done in core driver.
