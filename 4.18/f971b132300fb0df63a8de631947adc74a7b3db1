net: sched: mq: add simple offload notification

mq offload is trivial, we just need to let the device know
that the root qdisc is mq.  Alternative approach would be
to export qdisc_lookup() and make drivers check the root
type themselves, but notification via ndo_setup_tc is more
in line with other qdiscs.

Note that mq doesn't hold any stats on it's own, it just
adds up stats of its children.
