arm64/sve: Refactor user SVE trap maintenance for external use

In preparation for optimising the way KVM manages switching the
guest and host FPSIMD state, it is necessary to provide a means for
code outside arch/arm64/kernel/fpsimd.c to restore the user trap
configuration for SVE correctly for the current task.

Rather than requiring external code to duplicate the maintenance
explicitly, this patch moves the trap maintenenace to
fpsimd_bind_to_cpu(), since it is logically part of the work of
associating the current task with the cpu.

Because fpsimd_bind_to_cpu() is rather a cryptic name to publish
alongside fpsimd_bind_state_to_cpu(), the former function is
renamed to fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu() to make its purpose more
explicit.

This patch makes appropriate changes to ensure that
fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu() is always called alongside
task_fpsimd_load(), so that the trap maintenance continues to be
done in every situation where it was done prior to this patch.

As a side-effect, the metadata updates done by
fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu() now change from conditional to
unconditional in the "already bound" case of sigreturn.  This is
harmless, and a couple of extra stores on this slow path will not
impact performance.  I consider this a reasonable price to pay for
a slightly cleaner interface.
