infiniband: i40iw: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in i40iw_add_mqh_4

i40iw_add_mqh_4() is never called in atomic context, because it
calls rtnl_lock() that can sleep.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
i40iw_add_mqh_4() calls kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
which can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
