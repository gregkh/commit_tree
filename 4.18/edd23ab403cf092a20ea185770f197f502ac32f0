wcn36xx: clear all masks in RX interrupt

Like on the TX side, check for the interrupt reason when the RX interrupt
is latched and clear the ERR, DONE and ED masks.

This seems to help with connection timeouts and network stream
starvatations. And FWIW, the downstream driver does the same thing.

Note that in analogy to the TX side, WCN36XX_DXE_0_INT_CLR should be set to
WCN36XX_INT_MASK_CHAN_RX_{L,H} rather than WCN36XX_DXE_INT_CH{1,3}_MASK. It
did the right thing however, as the defines happen to have identical values.

Also, instead of determining register addresses and values inside
wcn36xx_rx_handle_packets(), pass them as arguments.
