ALSA: hda - Handle kzalloc() failure in snd_hda_attach_pcm_stream()

When 'kzalloc()' fails in 'snd_hda_attach_pcm_stream()', a new pcm instance is
created without setting its operators via 'snd_pcm_set_ops()'. Following
operations on the new pcm instance can trigger kernel null pointer dereferences
and cause kernel oops.

This bug was found with my work on building a gray-box fault-injection tool for
linux-kernel-module binaries. A kernel null pointer dereference was confirmed
from line 'substream->ops->open()' in function 'snd_pcm_open_substream()' in
file 'sound/core/pcm_native.c'.

This patch fixes the bug by calling 'snd_device_free()' in the error handling
path of 'kzalloc()', which removes the new pcm instance from the snd card before
returns with an error code.
