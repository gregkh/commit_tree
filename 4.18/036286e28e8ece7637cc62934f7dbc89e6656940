drm/amdgpu/df: fix potential array out-of-bounds read

The comparison with the number of elements in array df_v3_7_channel_number
is off-by-one and can produce an array out-of-bounds read if
fb_channel_number is equal to the number of elements of the array. Fix
this by changing the comparison to >= instead of >.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1469489 ("Out-of-bounds read")
