xsk: add user memory registration support sockopt

In this commit the base structure of the AF_XDP address family is set
up. Further, we introduce the abilty register a window of user memory
to the kernel via the XDP_UMEM_REG setsockopt syscall. The memory
window is viewed by an AF_XDP socket as a set of equally large
frames. After a user memory registration all frames are "owned" by the
user application, and not the kernel.

v2: More robust checks on umem creation and unaccount on error.
    Call set_page_dirty_lock on cleanup.
    Simplified xdp_umem_reg.
