powerpc/mm/hugetlb: Update huge_ptep_set_access_flags to call __ptep_set_access_flags directly

In a later patch, we want to update __ptep_set_access_flags take page size
arg. This makes ptep_set_access_flags only work with mmu_virtual_psize.
To simplify the code make huge_ptep_set_access_flags directly call
__ptep_set_access_flags so that we can compute the hugetlb page size in
hugetlb function.

Now that ptep_set_access_flags won't be called for hugetlb remove
the is_vm_hugetlb_page() check and add the assert of pte lock
unconditionally.
