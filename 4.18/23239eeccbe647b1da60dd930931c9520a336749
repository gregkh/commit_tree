scsi: cxlflash: Setup LISNs for user contexts

The SISLite specification has been updated for OCXL to support communicating
data to generate AFU interrupts to the AFU. This includes a new capability bit
that is advertised for OCXL AFUs and new registers to hold the object handle
and translation PASID of each interrupt. For Power, the object handle is the
mapped trigger page. Note that because these mappings are kernel only, the
PASID of a kernel context must be used to satisfy the translation.
