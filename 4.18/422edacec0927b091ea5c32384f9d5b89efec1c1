ubifs, xattr: remove misguided quota flags

Originally, Yang Dongsheng added quota support
for ubifs, but it turned out upstream won't accept it.

Since ubifs don't touch any quota code, S_NOQUOTA flag
is misguided here, and currently it is mainly used to
avoid recursion for system quota files.

Let's make things clearly and remove unnecessary and
misguied quota flags here.
