tick: Prefer a lower rating device only if it's CPU local device

Checking the equality of cpumask for both new and old tick device doesn't
ensure that it's CPU local device. This will cause issue if a low rating
clockevent tick device is registered first followed by the registration
of higher rating clockevent tick device.

In such case, clockevents_released list will never get emptied as both
the devices get selected as preferred one and we will loop forever in
clockevents_notify_released.
