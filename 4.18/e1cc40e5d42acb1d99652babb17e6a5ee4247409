fscrypt: log the crypto algorithm implementations

Log the crypto algorithm driver name for each fscrypt encryption mode on
its first use, also showing a friendly name for the mode.

This will help people determine whether the expected implementations are
being used.  In some cases we've seen people do benchmarks and reject
using encryption for performance reasons, when in fact they used a much
slower implementation of AES-XTS than was possible on the hardware.  It
can make an enormous difference; e.g., AES-XTS on ARM is about 10x
faster with the crypto extensions (AES instructions) than without.

This also makes it more obvious which modes are being used, now that
fscrypt supports multiple combinations of modes.

Example messages (with default modes, on x86_64):

[   35.492057] fscrypt: AES-256-CTS-CBC using implementation "cts(cbc-aes-aesni)"
[   35.492171] fscrypt: AES-256-XTS using implementation "xts-aes-aesni"

Note: algorithms can be dynamically added to the crypto API, which can
result in different implementations being used at different times.  But
this is rare; for most users, showing the first will be good enough.
