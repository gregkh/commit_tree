brcmfmac: Add support for bcm43364 wireless chipset

Add support for the BCM43364 chipset via an SDIO interface, as used in
e.g. the Murata 1FX module.

The BCM43364 uses the same firmware as the BCM43430 (which is already
included), the only difference is the omission of Bluetooth.

However, the SDIO_ID for the BCM43364 is 02D0:A9A4, giving it a MODALIAS
of sdio:c00v02D0dA9A4, which doesn't get recognised and hence doesn't
load the brcmfmac module. Adding the 'A9A4' ID in the appropriate place
triggers the brcmfmac driver to load, and then correctly use the
firmware file 'brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin'.
