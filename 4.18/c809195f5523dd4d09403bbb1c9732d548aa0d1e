rds: clean up loopback rds_connections on netns deletion

The RDS core module creates rds_connections based on callbacks
from rds_loop_transport when sending/receiving packets to local
addresses.

These connections will need to be cleaned up when they are
created from a netns that is not init_net, and that netns is deleted.

Add the changes aligned with the changes from
commit ebeeb1ad9b8a ("rds: tcp: use rds_destroy_pending() to synchronize
netns/module teardown and rds connection/workq management") for
rds_loop_transport
