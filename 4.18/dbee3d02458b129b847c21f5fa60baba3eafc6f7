KVM: x86: VMX: fix build without hyper-v

Commit ceef7d10dfb6 ("KVM: x86: VMX: hyper-v: Enlightened MSR-Bitmap
support") broke the build with Hyper-V disabled, because it accesses
ms_hyperv.nested_features without checking if that exists.

This is the quick-and-hacky build fix.

I suspect the proper fix is to replace the

    static_branch_unlikely(&enable_evmcs)

tests with an inline helper function that also checks that CONFIG_HYPERV
is enabled, since without that, enable_evmcs makes no sense.

But I want a working build environment first and foremost, and I'm upset
this slipped through in the first place.  My primary build tests missed
it because I tend to build with everything enabled, but it should have
been caught in the kvm tree.
