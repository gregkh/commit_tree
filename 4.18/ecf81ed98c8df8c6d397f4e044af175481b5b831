drm/exynos/dsi: mask frame-done interrupt

DSI driver is not really interested in this interrupt. It causes only
unnecessary code execution of interrupt handler and could possibly
cause FIFO overflow - as it triggers DSI interrupt handler to process
next DSI transfer. With this patch we will get rid of about 30 IRQ
handler calls per second.
