fuse: Support fuse filesystems outside of init_user_ns

In order to support mounts from namespaces other than init_user_ns, fuse
must translate uids and gids to/from the userns of the process servicing
requests on /dev/fuse. This patch does that, with a couple of restrictions
on the namespace:

 - The userns for the fuse connection is fixed to the namespace
   from which /dev/fuse is opened.

 - The namespace must be the same as s_user_ns.

These restrictions simplify the implementation by avoiding the need to pass
around userns references and by allowing fuse to rely on the checks in
setattr_prepare for ownership changes.  Either restriction could be relaxed
in the future if needed.

For cuse the userns used is the opener of /dev/cuse.  Semantically the cuse
support does not appear safe for unprivileged users.  Practically the
permissions on /dev/cuse only make it accessible to the global root user.
If something slips through the cracks in a user namespace the only users
who will be able to use the cuse device are those users mapped into the
user namespace.

Translation in the posix acl is updated to use the uuser namespace of the
filesystem.  Avoiding cases which might bypass this translation is handled
in a following change.

This change is stronlgy based on a similar change from Seth Forshee and
Dongsu Park.
