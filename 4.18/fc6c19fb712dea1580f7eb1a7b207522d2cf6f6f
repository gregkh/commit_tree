media: marvel-ccic: mmp: select VIDEOBUF2_VMALLOC/DMA_CONTIG

Testing randconfig builds after the return of the mmp ccic driver shows
a link error in some configurations:

drivers/media/platform/marvell-ccic/mcam-core.o: In function `mccic_register':
mcam-core.c:(.text+0x2e48): undefined reference to `vb2_dma_contig_memops'

A closer look at the mcam-core.c file reveals that we need to select
both VIDEOBUF2_DMA_CONTIG and VIDEOBUF2_VMALLOC, as already do for
VIDEO_CAFE_CCIC.
