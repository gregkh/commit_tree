rcu: Don't allocate rcu_nocb_mask if no one needs it

Commit 44c65ff2e3b0 ("rcu: Eliminate NOCBs CPU-state Kconfig options")
made allocation of rcu_nocb_mask depend only on the rcu_nocbs=,
nohz_full=, or isolcpus= kernel boot parameters.  However, it failed
to change the initial value of rcu_init_nohz()'s local variable
need_rcu_nocb_mask to false, which can result in useless allocation
of an all-zero rcu_nocb_mask.  This commit therefore fixes this bug by
changing the initial value of need_rcu_nocb_mask to false.

While we are in the area, also correct the error message that is printed
when someone specifies that can-never-exist CPUs should be NOCBs CPUs.
