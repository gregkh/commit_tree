staging: lustre: llite: initialize xattr->xe_namelen

When the allocation of xattr->xe_name was moved to kstrdup()
setting xattr->xe_namelen was dropped. This field is used
in several parts of the xattr cache code so it broke xattr
handling. Initialize xattr->xe_namelen when allocating
xattr->xe_name succeeds. Also change the debugging statement
to really report the xattr name instead of its length which
wasn't event being set.
