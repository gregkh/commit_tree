signal: Remove unncessary #ifdef SEGV_PKUERR in 32bit compat code

The only architecture that does not support SEGV_PKUERR is ia64 and
ia64 has not had 32bit support since some time in 2008.  Therefore
copy_siginfo_to_user32 and copy_siginfo_from_user32 do not need to
include support for a missing SEGV_PKUERR.

Compile test on ia64.
