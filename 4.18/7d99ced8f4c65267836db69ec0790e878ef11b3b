clk: qcom: Add support for BRANCH_HALT_SKIP flag for branch clocks

There could be few clocks where the clock status bit is not
required to be polled as the clock on/off would be controlled
by enabling/disabling external source. Add support for the
same by introducing new flag named as 'BRANCH_HALT_SKIP'.
