misc: ti-st: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in kim_probe

kim_probe() is never called in atomic context.
This function is only set as ".probe" in struct platform_driver.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
kim_probe() calls kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
which can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
