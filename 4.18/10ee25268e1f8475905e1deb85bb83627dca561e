xfs: allow empty transactions while frozen

In commit e89c041338ed6ef ("xfs: implement the GETFSMAP ioctl") we
created the ability to obtain empty transactions.  These transactions
have no log or block reservations and therefore can't modify anything.
Since they're also NO_WRITECOUNT they can run while the fs is frozen,
so we don't need to WARN_ON about that usage.
