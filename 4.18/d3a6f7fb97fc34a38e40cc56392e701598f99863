iwlwifi: mvm: set wakeup filters for wowlan "any" configuration

In case of "any" wowlan trigger is configured, no valid wakeup filter
was configured.

Moreover, the fw assumes there's no connection when there are no configured
wakeup filters.
This leads to the station info not being updated on D3 command, causing
rate_n_flags to be 0 when the offloading code sends tx frame (triggering
SYSASSERT_102C due to invalid antenna param)

Note: "any" trigger is currently assumed to only be used when entering
d0i3 (which has a different flow). However, we still reach this code
when using d3_test.
