drm/i915/execlists: Clear user-active flag on preemption completion

When cancelling the requests and clearing out the ports following a
successful preemption completion, also clear the active flag. I had
assumed that all preemptions would be followed by an immediate dequeue
(preserving the active user flag), but under rare circumstances we may
be triggering a preemption for the second port only for it to have
completed before the preemotion kicks in; leaving execlists->active set
even though the system is now idle.

We can clear the flag inside the common execlists_cancel_port_requests()
as the other users also expect the semantics of active being cleared.
