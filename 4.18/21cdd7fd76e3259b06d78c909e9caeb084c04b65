KVM: arm64: Remove eager host SVE state saving

Now that the host SVE context can be saved on demand from Hyp,
there is no longer any need to save this state in advance before
entering the guest.

This patch removes the relevant call to
kvm_fpsimd_flush_cpu_state().

Since the problem that function was intended to solve now no longer
exists, the function and its dependencies are also deleted.
