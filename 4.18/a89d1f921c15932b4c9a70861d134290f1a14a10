drm/i915: Split i915_gem_timeline into individual timelines

We need to move to a more flexible timeline that doesn't assume one
fence context per engine, and so allow for a single timeline to be used
across a combination of engines. This means that preallocating a fence
context per engine is now a hindrance, and so we want to introduce the
singular timeline. From the code perspective, this has the notable
advantage of clearing up a lot of mirky semantics and some clumsy
pointer chasing.

By splitting the timeline up into a single entity rather than an array
of per-engine timelines, we can realise the goal of the previous patch
of tracking the timeline alongside the ring.

v2: Tweak wait_for_idle to stop the compiling thinking that ret may be
uninitialised.
