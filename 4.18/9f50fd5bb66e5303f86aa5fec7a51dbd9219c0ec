crypto: testmgr - add more unkeyed crc32 and crc32c test vectors

crc32c has an unkeyed test vector but crc32 did not.  Add the crc32c one
(which uses an empty input) to crc32 too, and also add a new one to both
that uses a nonempty input.  These test vectors verify that crc32 and
crc32c implementations use the correct default initial state.
