udp: Partially unroll handling of first segment and last segment

This patch allows us to take care of unrolling the first segment and the
last segment of the loop for processing the segmented skb. Part of the
motivation for this is that it makes it easier to process the fact that the
first fame and all of the frames in between should be mostly identical
in terms of header data, and the last frame has differences in the length
and partial checksum.

In addition I am dropping the header length calculation since we don't
really need it for anything but the last frame and it can be easily
obtained by just pulling the data_len and offset of tail from the transport
header.
