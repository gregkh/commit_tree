ALSA: hda - Enforce CONFIG_SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS for HDMI/DP codec

The DP-MST support requires more PCM streams than usual, hence
CONFIG_SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS is almost mandatory.  Currently the driver
just warns and continues even if streams are missing, but it doesn't
seem to enough convince users to switch to the modern setup.

This patch adds the enforced selection of CONFIG_SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS
from CONFIG_SND_HDA_CODEC_HDMI for covering that.
