ibmvnic: Create separate initialization routine for resets

Instead of having one initialization routine for all cases, create
a separate, simpler function for standard initialization, such as during
device probe. Use the original initialization function to handle
device reset scenarios. The goal of this patch is to avoid having
a single, cluttered init function to handle all possible
scenarios.
