tcp: limit sk_rcvlowat by the maximum receive buffer

The user-provided value to setsockopt(SO_RCVLOWAT) can be
larger than the maximum possible receive buffer. Such values
mute POLLIN signals on the socket which can stall progress
on the socket.

Limit the user-provided value to half of the maximum receive
buffer, i.e., half of sk_rcvbuf when the receive buffer size
is set by the user, or otherwise half of sysctl_tcp_rmem[2].
