net: hns3: Change return value in hnae3_register_client

A client includes many client instance. Just like ae_algo, Initializing
client instance failed does not represent registering client failed.
The action of registering client just is adding client to the client
list and the result always is true. This patch changes the return
value of hnae3_register_client form a variable value to a fixed value,
makes the function always return ok.
