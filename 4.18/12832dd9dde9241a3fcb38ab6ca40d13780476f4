media: vsp1: Adapt entities to configure into a body

Currently the entities store their configurations into a display list.
Adapt this such that the code can be configured into a body directly,
allowing greater flexibility and control of the content.

All users of vsp1_dl_list_write() are removed in this process, thus it
too is removed.

A helper, vsp1_dl_list_get_body0() is provided to access the internal body0
from the display list.
