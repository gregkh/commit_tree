cpufreq: Use static SRCU initializer

Use the static SRCU initializer for `cpufreq_transition_notifier_list'.
This avoids the init_cpufreq_transition_notifier_list() initcall. Its
only purpose is to initialize the SRCU notifier once during boot and set
another variable which is used as an indicator whether the init was
perfromed before cpufreq_register_notifier() was used.
