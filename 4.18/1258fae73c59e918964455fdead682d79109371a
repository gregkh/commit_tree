workqueue: Replace pool->attach_mutex with global wq_pool_attach_mutex

To improve workqueue visibility, we want to be able to access
workqueue information from worker tasks.  The per-pool attach mutex
makes that difficult because there's no way of stabilizing task ->
worker pool association without knowing the pool first.

Worker attach/detach is a slow path and there's no need for different
pools to be able to perform them concurrently.  This patch replaces
the per-pool attach_mutex with global wq_pool_attach_mutex to prepare
for visibility improvement changes.
