ath10k: sdio: jump to correct label in error handling path

Jump to the correct label in error handling path.
At this point of execution create_singlethread_workqueue() has succeeded,
so it should be properly destroyed.

Jump label was renamed in commit ec2c64e20257 ("ath10k: sdio: fix memory
leak for probe allocations").
However, the bug was originally introduced in commit d96db25d2025
("ath10k: add initial SDIO support").
