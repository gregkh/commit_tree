tools: bpf: don't complain about no kernel version for networking code

BPF programs only have to specify the target kernel version for
tracing related hooks, in networking world that requirement does
not really apply.  Loosen the checks in libbpf to reflect that.

bpf_object__open() users will continue to see the error for backward
compatibility (and because prog_type is not available there).

Error code for NULL file name is changed from ENOENT to EINVAL,
as it seems more appropriate, hopefully, that's an OK change.
