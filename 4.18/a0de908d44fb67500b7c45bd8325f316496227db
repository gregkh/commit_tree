drm/i915: Reorder early initialization

In upcoming patch, we want to perform more actions in early
initialization of the uC. This reordering will help resolve
new dependencies that will be introduced by future patch.

v2: s/i915_gem_load_init/i915_gem_init_early (Chris)
v3: s/i915_gem_load_cleanup/i915_gem_cleanup_early (Michal)
