drm/i915/lrc: Scrub the GPU state of the guilty hanging request

Previously, we just reset the ring register in the context image such
that we could skip over the broken batch and emit the closing
breadcrumb. However, on resume the context image and GPU state would be
reloaded, which may have been left in an inconsistent state by the
reset. The presumption was that at worst it would just cause another
reset and skip again until it recovered, however it seems just as likely
to cause an unrecoverable hang. Instead of risking loading an incomplete
context image, restore it back to the default state.

v2: Fix up off-by-one from including the ppHSWP in with the register
state.
v3: Use a ring local to compact a few lines.
v4: Beware setting the ring local before checking for a NULL request.
