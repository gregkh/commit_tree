ieee802154: at86rf230: use __func__ macro for debug messages

Instead of having the function name hard-coded (it might change and we
forgot to update them in the debug output) we can use __func__ instead
and also shorter the line so we do not need to break it. Also fix an
extra blank line while being here.
