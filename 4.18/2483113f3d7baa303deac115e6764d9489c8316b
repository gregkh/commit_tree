xfs: xfs_rtword_t should be unsigned, not signed

xfs_rtword_t is used for bit manipulations in the realtime bitmap file.
Since we're performing bit shifts with this type, we don't want sign
extension and we don't want to be left shifting negative quantities
because that's undefined behavior.

This also shuts up these UBSAN warnings:
UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_rtbitmap.c:833:48
signed integer overflow:
-2147483648 - 1 cannot be represented in type 'int'
