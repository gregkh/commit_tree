ARM: 8775/1: NOMMU: Use instr_sync instead of plain isb in common code

Greg reported that commit 3c24121039c9d ("ARM: 8756/1: NOMMU: Postpone
MPU activation till __after_proc_init") is causing breakage for the
old Versatile platform in no-MMU mode (with out-of-tree patches):

  AS      arch/arm/kernel/head-nommu.o
arch/arm/kernel/head-nommu.S: Assembler messages:
arch/arm/kernel/head-nommu.S:180: Error: selected processor does not support `isb' in ARM mode
scripts/Makefile.build:417: recipe for target 'arch/arm/kernel/head-nommu.o' failed
make[2]: *** [arch/arm/kernel/head-nommu.o] Error 1
Makefile:1034: recipe for target 'arch/arm/kernel' failed
make[1]: *** [arch/arm/kernel] Error 2

Since the code is common for all NOMMU builds usage of the isb was a
bad idea (please, note that isb also used in MPU related code which is
fine because MPU has dependency on CPU_V7/CPU_V7M), instead use more
robust instr_sync assembler macro.
