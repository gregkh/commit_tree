netfilter: ipset: forbid family for hash:mac sets

Userspace `ipset` command forbids family option for hash:mac type:

ipset create test hash:mac family inet4
ipset v6.30: Unknown argument: `family'

However, this check is not done in kernel itself. When someone use
external netlink applications (pyroute2 python library for example), one
can create hash:mac with invalid family and inconsistant results from
userspace (`ipset` command cannot read set content anymore).

This patch enforce the logic in kernel, and forbids insertion of
hash:mac with a family set.

Since IP_SET_PROTO_UNDEF is defined only for hash:mac, this patch has no
impact on other hash:* sets
