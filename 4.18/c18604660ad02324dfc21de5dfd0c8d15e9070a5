mfd: arizona: Update reset pin to use GPIOD

Now GPIOD has support for both pdata systems and for non-standard DT
bindings the Arizona reset GPIO can be converted to use it. Worth
noting gpiod_set_raw_value_cansleep is used to match the behaviour
of the old GPIOs. This is because the part is fairly widely used and
it is unknown how many DTs are correctly setting active low through
device tree, so to avoid breaking any existing users it is best to
match the previous behaviour.
