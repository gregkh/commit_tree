serial/aspeed-vuart: Implement rx throttling

The aspeed VUART runs at LPC bus frequency, rather than being restricted
to a typical UART baud rate. This means that the VUART can receive a lot
of data, which can overrun tty flip buffers, and/or cause a large amount
of interrupt traffic.

This change implements the uart_port->throttle & unthrottle callbacks,
implemented by disabling the receiver line status & received data
available IRQs.
