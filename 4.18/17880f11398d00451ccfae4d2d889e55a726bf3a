crypto: testmgr - make an cbc(des) encryption test vector chunked

One "cbc(des)" decryption test vector doesn't exactly match an
encryption test vector with input and result swapped.  It's *almost* the
same as one, but the decryption version is "chunked" while the
encryption version is "unchunked".  In preparation for removing the
decryption test vectors, make the encryption one both chunked and
unchunked, so we don't lose any test coverage.
