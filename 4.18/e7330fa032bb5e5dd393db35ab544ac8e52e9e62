Input: add support for ChipOne icn8505 based touchscreens

The ChipOne icn8505 is an i2c capacitive touchscreen controller typically
used in cheap x86 tablets, this commit adds a driver for it.

Note the icn8505 is somewhat similar to the icn8318 and I started with
modifying that driver to support both, but in the end the differences were
too large and I decided to write a new driver instead.
