usb: hub: Don't wait for connect state at resume for powered-off ports

wait_for_connected() wait till a port change status to
USB_PORT_STAT_CONNECTION, but this is not possible if
the port is unpowered. The loop will only exit at timeout.

Such case take place if an over-current incident happen
while system is in S3. Then during resume wait_for_connected()
will wait 2s, which may be noticeable by the user.
