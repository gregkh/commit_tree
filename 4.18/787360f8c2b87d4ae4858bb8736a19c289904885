samples: bpf: fix build after move to compiling full libbpf.a

There are many ways users may compile samples, some of them got
broken by commit 5f9380572b4b ("samples: bpf: compile and link
against full libbpf").  Improve path resolution and make libbpf
building a dependency of source files to force its build.

Samples should now again build with any of:
 cd samples/bpf; make
 make samples/bpf/
 make -C samples/bpf
 cd samples/bpf; make O=builddir
 make samples/bpf/ O=builddir
 make -C samples/bpf O=builddir
 export KBUILD_OUTPUT=builddir
 make samples/bpf/
 make -C samples/bpf
