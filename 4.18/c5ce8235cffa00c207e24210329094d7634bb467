KVM: VMX: Optimize tscdeadline timer latency

'Commit d0659d946be0 ("KVM: x86: add option to advance tscdeadline
hrtimer expiration")' advances the tscdeadline (the timer is emulated
by hrtimer) expiration in order that the latency which is incurred
by hypervisor (apic_timer_fn -> vmentry) can be avoided. This patch
adds the advance tscdeadline expiration support to which the tscdeadline
timer is emulated by VMX preemption timer to reduce the hypervisor
lantency (handle_preemption_timer -> vmentry). The guest can also
set an expiration that is very small (for example in Linux if an
hrtimer feeds a expiration in the past); in that case we set delta_tsc
to 0, leading to an immediately vmexit when delta_tsc is not bigger than
advance ns.

This patch can reduce ~63% latency (~4450 cycles to ~1660 cycles on
a haswell desktop) for kvm-unit-tests/tscdeadline_latency when testing
busy waits.
