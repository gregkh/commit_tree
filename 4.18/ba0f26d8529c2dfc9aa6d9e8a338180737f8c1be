x86/intel_rdt/mba_sc: Prepare for feedback loop

This is a preparatory patch for the mba feedback loop. Add support to
measure the "bandwidth in MBps" and the "delta bandwidth". Measure it by
reading the MBM IA32_QM_CTR MSRs and calculating the amount of "bytes"
moved. There is no user space interface for this and will only be used by
the feedback loop patch.
