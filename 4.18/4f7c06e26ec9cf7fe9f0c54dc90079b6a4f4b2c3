powerpc/ptrace: Fix setting 512B aligned breakpoints with PTRACE_SET_DEBUGREG

In commit e2a800beaca1 ("powerpc/hw_brk: Fix off by one error when
validating DAWR region end") we fixed setting the DAWR end point to
its max value via PPC_PTRACE_SETHWDEBUG. Unfortunately we broke
PTRACE_SET_DEBUGREG when setting a 512 byte aligned breakpoint.

PTRACE_SET_DEBUGREG currently sets the length of the breakpoint to
zero (memset() in hw_breakpoint_init()). This worked with
arch_validate_hwbkpt_settings() before the above patch was applied but
is now broken if the breakpoint is 512byte aligned.

This sets the length of the breakpoint to 8 bytes when using
PTRACE_SET_DEBUGREG.
