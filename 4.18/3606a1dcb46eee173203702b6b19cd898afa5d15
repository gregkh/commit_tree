coresight tmc etr: Make memory check consistent in the same function

While operating from sysFS the TMC-ETR driver needs to make sure it has
memory to work with but doesn't allocate memory uselessly either.  Since
the main memory handle for this driver is drvdata::vaddr, use it throughout
function tmc_enable_etr_sink_sysfs() so that things are consistent.
