time: Change nanosleep to safe __kernel_* types

Change over clock_nanosleep syscalls to use y2038 safe
__kernel_timespec times. This will enable changing over
of these syscalls to use new y2038 safe syscalls when
the architectures define the CONFIG_64BIT_TIME.

Note that nanosleep syscall is deprecated and does not have a
plan for making it y2038 safe. But, the syscall should work as
before on 64 bit machines and on 32 bit machines, the syscall
works correctly until y2038 as before using the existing compat
syscall version. There is no new syscall for supporting 64 bit
time_t on 32 bit architectures.
