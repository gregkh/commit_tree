Revert "drm/amd/display: Don't return ddc result and read_bytes in same return value"

This reverts commit 018d82e5f02ef3583411bcaa4e00c69786f46f19.

This breaks DDC in certain cases.  Revert for 4.18 and previous kernels.
For 4.19, this is fixed with the following more extensive patches:
drm/amd/display: Serialize is_dp_sink_present
drm/amd/display: Break out function to simply read aux reply
drm/amd/display: Return aux replies directly to DRM
drm/amd/display: Right shift AUX reply value sooner than later
drm/amd/display: Read AUX channel even if only status byte is returned
