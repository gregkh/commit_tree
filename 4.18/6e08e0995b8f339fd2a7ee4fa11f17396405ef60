drm/amdgpu: Avoid reclaim while holding locks taken in MMU notifier

When an MMU notifier runs in memory reclaim context, it can deadlock
trying to take locks that are already held in the thread causing the
memory reclaim. The solution is to avoid memory reclaim while holding
locks that are taken in MMU notifiers.

This commit fixes kmalloc while holding rmn->lock by moving the call
outside the lock. The GFX MMU notifier also locks reservation objects.
I have no good solution for avoiding reclaim while holding reservation
objects. The HSA MMU notifier will not lock any reservation objects.

v2: Moved allocation outside lock instead of using GFP_NOIO
