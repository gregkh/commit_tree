rtc: sun6i: Fix bit_idx value for clk_register_gate

clk-gate core will take bit_idx through clk_register_gate
and then do clk_gate_ops by using BIT(bit_idx), but rtc-sun6i
is passing bit_idx as BIT(bit_idx) it becomes BIT(BIT(bit_idx)
which is wrong and eventually external gate clock is not enabling.

This patch fixed by passing bit index and the original change
introduced from below commit.
