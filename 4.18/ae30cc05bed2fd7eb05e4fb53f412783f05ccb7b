powerpc64/ftrace: Implement support for ftrace_regs_caller()

With -mprofile-kernel, we always save the full register state in
ftrace_caller(). While this works, this is inefficient if we're not
interested in the register state, such as when we're using the function
tracer.

Rename the existing ftrace_caller() as ftrace_regs_caller() and provide
a simpler implementation for ftrace_caller() that is used when registers
are not required to be saved.
