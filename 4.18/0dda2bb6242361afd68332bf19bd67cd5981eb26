driver-core: return EINVAL error instead of BUG_ON()

I triggerd the BUG_ON() in driver_register() when booting a domU Xen
domain. Since there was no contextual information logged, I needed to
attach kgdb to determine the culprit (the wmi-bmof driver in my
case). The BUG_ON() was added in commit f48f3febb2cb ("driver-core: do
not register a driver with bus_type not registered").

Instead of running into a BUG_ON() we print an error message
identifying the, likely faulty, driver but continue booting.
