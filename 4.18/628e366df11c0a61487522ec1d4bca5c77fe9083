gfs2: Iomap cleanups and improvements

Clean up gfs2_iomap_alloc and gfs2_iomap_get.  Document how
gfs2_iomap_alloc works: it now needs to be called separately after
gfs2_iomap_get where necessary; this will be used later by iomap write.
Move gfs2_iomap_ops into bmap.c.

Introduce a new gfs2_iomap_get_alloc helper and use it in
fallocate_chunk: gfs2_iomap_begin will become unsuitable for fallocate
with proper iomap write support.

In gfs2_block_map and fallocate_chunk, zero-initialize struct iomap.
