rseq/selftests: Implement MIPS support

Implement support for both MIPS32 & MIPS64 in the rseq selftests, in
order to sanity check the recently enabled rseq syscall.

The tests all pass on a MIPS Boston development board running either a
MIPS32r2 interAptiv CPU & a MIPS64r6 I6500 CPU, both of which were
configured with 2 cores each of which have 2 hardware threads (VP(E)s) -
ie. 4 CPUs.
