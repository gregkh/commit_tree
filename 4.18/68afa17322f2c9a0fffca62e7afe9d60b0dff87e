media: zoran: move to staging in preparation for removal

This driver hasn't been tested in a long, long time. The hardware is
ancient and pretty much obsolete. This driver also needs to be converted
to newer media frameworks (vb2!) but due to the lack of time and interest
that is unlikely to happen.

So this driver is a prime candidate for removal. If someone is interested
in working on this driver to prevent its removal, then please contact the
linux-media mailinglist.
