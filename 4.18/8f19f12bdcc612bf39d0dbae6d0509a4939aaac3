selftests: in udpgso_bench do not test udp zerocopy

The udpgso benchmark compares various configurations of UDP and TCP.
Including one that is not upstream, udp zerocopy. This is a leftover
from the earlier RFC patchset.

The test is part of kselftests and run in continuous spinners. Remove
the failing case to make the test start passing.
