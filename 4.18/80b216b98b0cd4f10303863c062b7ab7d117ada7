drm/i915: store all mmio bases in intel_engines

The mmio bases we're currently storing in the intel_engines array are
only valid for a subset of gens, so we need to ignore them and use
different values in some cases. Instead of doing that, we can have a
table of [starting gen, mmio base] pairs for each engine in
intel_engines and select the correct one based on the gen we're running
on in a consistent way.

v2: document that the list goes in reverse order, update starting gen
    for render (Chris)

v3: starting gen for render back to 1 to make our life easier with
    selftests (Chris)
