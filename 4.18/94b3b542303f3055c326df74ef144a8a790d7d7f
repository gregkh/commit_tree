net: aquantia: vlan unicast address list correct handling

Setting up macvlan/macvtap networks over atlantic NIC results
in no traffic over these networks because ndo_set_rx_mode did
not listed UC MACs as registered in unicast filter.

Here we fix that taking into account maximum number of UC
filters supported by hardware. If more than MAX addresses were
registered, we just enable promisc  and/or allmulti to pass
the traffic in.

We also remove MULTICAST_ADDRESS_MAX constant from aq_cfg since
thats not a configurable parameter at all.
