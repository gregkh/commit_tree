clk: meson: meson8b: add support for the NAND clocks

This adds the NAND clocks (from the HHI_NAND_CLK_CNTL register) to the
Meson8b clock driver. There are three NAND clocks: a gate which enables
or disables the NAND clock, a mux and a divider (which divides the mux
output).
Unfortunately the public S805 datasheet does not document the mux
parents. However, the vendor kernel has a few hints for us which allows
us to make an educated guess about the clock parents. To do this we need
to have a look at set_nand_core_clk() from the vendor's NAND driver (see
[0]):
- XTAL = (4<<9) | (1<<8) | 0
- 160MHz = (0<<9) | (1<<8) | 3)
- 182MHz = (3<<9) | (1<<8) | 1)
- 212MHz = (1<<9) | (1<<8) | 3)
- 255MHz = (2<<9) | (1<<8) | 1)

While there is a comment for the XTAL parent (which indicates that it
should only be used for debugging) we have to do a bit of math for the
other parents: target_freq * divider = rate of parent clock
Bit 8 above is the enable bit, so we can ignore it here. Bits 11:9 are
the mux index and bits 6:0 are the 0-based divider (so we need to add
1). This gives us:
- mux 0 (160MHz * 4) = fclk_div4 (actual rate = 637.5MHz, off by 2.5MHz)
- mux 1 (212MHz * 4) = fclk_div3 (actual rate = 850MHz, off by 2MHz)
- mux 2 (255MHz * 2) = fclk_div5 (matches exactly 510MHz)
- mux 3 (182MHz * 2) = fclk_div7 (actual rate = 346.3MHz, off by 0.3MHz)
