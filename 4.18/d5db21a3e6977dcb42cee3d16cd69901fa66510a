erspan: auto detect truncated ipv6 packets.

Currently the truncated bit is set only when 1) the mirrored packet
is larger than mtu and 2) the ipv4 packet tot_len is larger than
the actual skb->len.  This patch adds another case for detecting
whether ipv6 packet is truncated or not, by checking the ipv6 header
payload_len and the skb->len.
