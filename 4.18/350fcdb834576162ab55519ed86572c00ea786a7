rsi: remove unecessary PTR_ALIGN()s

The issue here is that we allocate "data" and then set
"data = PTR_ALIGN(data, 8);" and then we free the aligned pointer
instead of the original pointer.

kmalloc() pointers are already ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN aligned which is 8 or
more on everything except certain Xtensa variants.  We decided that if
the Xtensa people ever notice a bug here then we'll tell them the bug is
on their side.  ;)
