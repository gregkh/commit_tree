x86/entry/64/compat: Fix "x86/entry/64/compat: Preserve r8-r11 in int $0x80"

Commit:

  8bb2610bc496 ("x86/entry/64/compat: Preserve r8-r11 in int $0x80")

was busted: my original patch had a minor conflict with
some of the nospec changes, but "git apply" is very clever
and silently accepted the patch by making the same changes
to a different function in the same file.  There was obviously
a huge offset, but "git apply" for some reason doesn't feel
any need to say so.

Move the changes to the correct function.  Now the
test_syscall_vdso_32 selftests passes.

If anyone cares to observe the original problem, try applying the
patch at:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/d4c4d9985fbe64f8c9e19291886453914b48caee.1523975710.git.luto@kernel.org/raw

to the kernel at 316d097c4cd4e7f2ef50c40cff2db266593c4ec4:

 - "git am" and "git apply" accept the patch without any complaints at all
 - "patch -p1" at least prints out a message about the huge offset.
