qed: Add configuration information to register dump and debug data

Configuration information is added to the debug data collection, in
addition to register dump.
Added qed_dbg_nvm_image() that receives an image type, allocates a
buffer and reads the image. The images are saved in the buffers and the
dump size is updated.
