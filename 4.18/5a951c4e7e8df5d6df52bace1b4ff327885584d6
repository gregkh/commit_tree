powerpc/watchdog: don't update the watchdog timestamp if a lockup is detected

The watchdog heartbeat timestamp is updated when the local heartbeat
timer fires (or touch_nmi_watchdog() is called).

This is an interesting data point, so don't overwrite it when the
soft-NMI interrupt detects a hard lockup. That code came from a pre-
merge version to prevent hard lockup messages flood, but that's taken
care of with the stuck CPU logic now, so there is no reason to
update the heartbeat timestamp here.
