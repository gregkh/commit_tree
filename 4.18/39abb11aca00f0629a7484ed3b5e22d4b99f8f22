scsi: zfcp: decouple FSF request setup of TMF from scsi_cmnd

In zfcp_fsf_fcp_task_mgmt() resolve the still old argument scsi_cmnd into
scsi_device very early and only depend on scsi_device and derived objects in
the function body.

This prepares to later change the function signature replacing the scsi_cmnd
argument with scsi_device.
