net: bridge: Fix locking in br_fdb_find_port()

Callers of br_fdb_find() need to hold the hash lock, which
br_fdb_find_port() doesn't do. However, since br_fdb_find_port() is not
doing any actual FDB manipulation, the hash lock is not really needed at
all. So convert to br_fdb_find_rcu(), surrounded by rcu_read_lock() /
_unlock() pair.

The device pointer copied from inside the FDB entry is then kept alive
by the RTNL lock, which br_fdb_find_port() asserts.
