i2c: rcar: handle RXDMA HW behaviour on Gen3

On Gen3, we can only do RXDMA once per transfer reliably. For that, we
must reset the device, then we can have RXDMA once. This patch
implements this. When there is no reset controller or the reset fails,
RXDMA will be blocked completely. Otherwise, it will be disabled after
the first RXDMA transfer. Based on a commit from the BSP by Hiromitsu
Yamasaki, yet completely refactored to handle multiple read messages
within one transfer.
