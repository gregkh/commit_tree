kvm: vmx: Basic APIC virtualization controls have three settings

Previously, we toggled between SECONDARY_EXEC_VIRTUALIZE_X2APIC_MODE
and SECONDARY_EXEC_VIRTUALIZE_APIC_ACCESSES, depending on whether or
not the EXTD bit was set in MSR_IA32_APICBASE. However, if the local
APIC is disabled, we should not set either of these APIC
virtualization control bits.
