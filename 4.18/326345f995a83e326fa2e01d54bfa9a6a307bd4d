MIPS: pb44: Fix i2c-gpio GPIO descriptor table

I used bad names in my clumsiness when rewriting many board
files to use GPIO descriptors instead of platform data. A few
had the platform_device ID set to -1 which would indeed give
the device name "i2c-gpio".

But several had it set to >=0 which gives the names
"i2c-gpio.0", "i2c-gpio.1" ...

Fix the one affected board in the MIPS tree. Sorry.
