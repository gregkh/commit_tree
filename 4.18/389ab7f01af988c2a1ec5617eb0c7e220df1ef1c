xdp: introduce xdp_return_frame_rx_napi

When sending an xdp_frame through xdp_do_redirect call, then error
cases can happen where the xdp_frame needs to be dropped, and
returning an -errno code isn't sufficient/possible any-longer
(e.g. for cpumap case). This is already fully supported, by simply
calling xdp_return_frame.

This patch is an optimization, which provides xdp_return_frame_rx_napi,
which is a faster variant for these error cases.  It take advantage of
the protection provided by XDP RX running under NAPI protection.

This change is mostly relevant for drivers using the page_pool
allocator as it can take advantage of this. (Tested with mlx5).
