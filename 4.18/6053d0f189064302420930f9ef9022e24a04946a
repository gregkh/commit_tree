udp: Add support for software checksum and GSO_PARTIAL with GSO offload

This patch adds support for a software provided checksum and GSO_PARTIAL
segmentation support. With this we can offload UDP segmentation on devices
that only have partial support for tunnels.

Since we are no longer needing the hardware checksum we can drop the checks
in the segmentation code that were verifying if it was present.
