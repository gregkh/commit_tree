drm/i915: Split out parking from the idle worker for reuse

We will want to park GEM before disengaging the drive^W^W^W unwedging.
Since we already do the work for idling, expose the guts as a new
function that we can then reuse.

v2: Just skip if already parked; makes it more forgiving to use by
future callers.
v3: Extract mark_busy, rename it to i915_gem_unpark and place it next to
i915_gem_park so that we can evaluate it for symmetry more easily.
Calling GEM from inside i915_request looks to be a bit of a layering
violation, for the moment I am imaging them as being notify_cb.
