tipc: introduce ioctl for fetching node identity

After the introduction of a 128-bit node identity it may be difficult
for a user to correlate between this identity and the generated node
hash address.

We now try to make this easier by introducing a new ioctl() call for
fetching a node identity by using the hash value as key. This will
be particularly useful when we extend some of the commands in the
'tipc' tool, but we also expect regular user applications to need
this feature.
