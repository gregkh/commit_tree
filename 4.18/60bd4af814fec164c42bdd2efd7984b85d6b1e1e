net/mlx5e: Add ingress/egress indication for offloaded TC flows

When an e-switch TC rule is offloaded through the egdev (egress
device) mechanism, we treat this as egress, all other cases (NIC
and e-switch) are considred ingress.

This is preparation step that will allow us to  identify "wrong"
stat/del offload calls made by the TC core on egdev based flows and
ignore them.
