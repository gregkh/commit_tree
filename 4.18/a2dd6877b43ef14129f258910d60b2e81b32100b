soc: ti: K2G: provide APIs to support driver probe deferral

This patch provide APIs to allow client drivers to support
probe deferral. On K2G SoC, devices can be probed only
after the ti_sci_pm_domains driver is probed and ready.
As drivers may get probed at different order, any driver
that depends on knav dma and qmss drivers, for example
netcp network driver, needs to defer probe until
knav devices are probed and ready to service. To do this,
add an API to query the device ready status from the knav
dma and qmss devices.
