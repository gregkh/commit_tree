PM / Domains: Don't attach devices in genpd with multi PM domains

The power-domain DT property may now contain a list of PM domain
specifiers, which represents that a device are partitioned across multiple
PM domains. This leads to a new situation in genpd_dev_pm_attach(), as only
one PM domain can be attached per device.

To remain things simple for the most common configuration, when a single PM
domain is used, let's treat the multiple PM domain case as being specific.

In other words, let's change genpd_dev_pm_attach() to check for multiple PM
domains and prevent it from attach any PM domain for this case. Instead,
leave this to be managed separately, from following changes to genpd.
