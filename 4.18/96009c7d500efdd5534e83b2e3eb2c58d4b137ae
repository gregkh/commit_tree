sched: replace __QDISC_STATE_RUNNING bit with a spin lock

So that we can use lockdep on it.
The newly introduced sequence lock has the same scope of busylock,
so it shares the same lockdep annotation, but it's only used for
NOLOCK qdiscs.

With this changeset we acquire such lock in the control path around
flushing operation (qdisc reset), to allow more NOLOCK qdisc perf
improvement in the next patch.
