kconfig: add 'shell' built-in function

This accepts a single command to execute.  It returns the standard
output from it.

[Example code]

  config HELLO
          string
          default "$(shell,echo hello world)"

  config Y
          def_bool $(shell,echo y)

[Result]

  $ make -s alldefconfig && tail -n 2 .config
  CONFIG_HELLO="hello world"
  CONFIG_Y=y

Caveat:
Like environments, functions are expanded in the lexer.  You cannot
pass symbols to function arguments.  This is a limitation to simplify
the implementation.  I want to avoid the dynamic function evaluation,
which would introduce much more complexity.
