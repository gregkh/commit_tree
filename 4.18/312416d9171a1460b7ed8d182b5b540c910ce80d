drivers: qcom: add command DB driver

Command DB is a simple database in the shared memory of QCOM SoCs, that
provides information regarding shared resources. Some shared resources
in the SoC have properties that are probed dynamically at boot by the
remote processor. The information pertaining to the SoC and the platform
are made available in the shared memory. Drivers can query this
information using predefined strings.
