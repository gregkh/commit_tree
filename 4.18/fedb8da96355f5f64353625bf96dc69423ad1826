parisc: Define mb() and add memory barriers to assembler unlock sequences

For years I thought all parisc machines executed loads and stores in
order. However, Jeff Law recently indicated on gcc-patches that this is
not correct. There are various degrees of out-of-order execution all the
way back to the PA7xxx processor series (hit-under-miss). The PA8xxx
series has full out-of-order execution for both integer operations, and
loads and stores.

This is described in the following article:

For this reason, we need to define mb() and to insert a memory barrier
before the store unlocking spinlocks. This ensures that all memory
accesses are complete prior to unlocking. The ldcw instruction performs
the same function on entry.
