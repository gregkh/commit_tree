IB/hfi1: Cleanup of exp_rcv

The knowledge of the internal workings of the expect receive
is too distributed.

Fix by:
- right size several rcd fields associated with
  expect receive
- making an init entrance to init all the lists
- consolidate all the allocations into an array anchored
  in the rcd
