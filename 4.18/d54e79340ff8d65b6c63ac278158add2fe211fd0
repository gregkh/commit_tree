drm/i915/gvt: Dereference msi eventfd_ctx when it isn't used anymore

kvmgt get msi eventfd_ctx at qemu vfio set irq eventfd, then
msi eventfd_ctx should be put at some point.
The first point is kvmgt handle qemu vfio_disable_irqindex()
call which has DATA_NONE and ACTION_TRIGGER in flags.
If qemu doesn't call vfio_disable_irqindex(), the second point
is vgpu release function.

v2: Don't inject msi interrupt into guest if eventfd_ctx is dereferenced
