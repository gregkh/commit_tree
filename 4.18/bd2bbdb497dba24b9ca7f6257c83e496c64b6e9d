netfilter: merge meta_bridge into nft_meta

It overcomplicates things for no reason.
nft_meta_bridge only offers retrieval of bridge port interface name.

Because of this being its own module, we had to export all nft_meta
functions, which we can then make static again (which even reduces
the size of nft_meta -- including bridge port retrieval...):
