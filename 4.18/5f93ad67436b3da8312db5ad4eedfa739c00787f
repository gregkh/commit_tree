mm: treat memory.low value inclusive

If memcg's usage is equal to the memory.low value, avoid reclaiming from
this cgroup while there is a surplus of reclaimable memory.

This sounds more logical and also matches memory.high and memory.max
behavior: both are inclusive.

Empty cgroups are not considered protected, so MEMCG_LOW events are not
emitted for empty cgroups, if there is no more reclaimable memory in the
system.
