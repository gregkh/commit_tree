drm/i915/fbdev: Enable late fbdev initial configuration

If the initial fbdev configuration (intel_fbdev_initial_config()) runs
and there still no sink connected it will cause
drm_fb_helper_initial_config() to return 0 as no error happened (but
internally the return is -EAGAIN).  Because no framebuffer was
allocated, when a sink is connected intel_fbdev_output_poll_changed()
will not execute drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event() that would trigger
another try to do the initial fbdev configuration.

So here allowing drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event() to be executed when there
is no framebuffer allocated and fbdev was not set up yet.

This issue also happens when a MST DP sink is connected since boot, as
the MST topology is discovered in parallel if
intel_fbdev_initial_config() is executed before the first sink MST is
discovered it will cause this same issue.

This is a follow-up patch of
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/196089/

Changes from v1:
- not creating a dump framebuffer anymore, instead just allowing
  drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event() to execute when fbdev is not setup yet.
