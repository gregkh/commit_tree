mmc: Allow non-sleeping GPIO cd

This change uses the appropriate _cansleep or non-sleeping API for
reading GPIO card detect state. This allows users with GPIOs that
never sleep to avoid a warning when certain quirks are present.

The sdhci controller has an SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_CARD_NO_RESET, which
indicates that a controller will not reset properly if no card is
inserted. With this quirk enabled, mmc_get_cd_gpio is called in
several places with a spinlock held and interrupts disabled.
gpiod_get_raw_value_cansleep is not happy with this situation,
and throws out a warning.

For boards that a) use controllers that have this quirk, and b) wire
card detect up to a GPIO that doesn't sleep, this is a spurious warning.
This change silences that warning, at the cost of pushing this problem
down to users that have sleeping GPIOs and controllers with this quirk.
