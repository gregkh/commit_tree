KVM: nVMX: Restore the VMCS12 offsets for v4.0 fields

Changing the VMCS12 layout will break save/restore compatibility with
older kvm releases once the KVM_{GET,SET}_NESTED_STATE ioctls are
accepted upstream. Google has already been using these ioctls for some
time, and we implore the community not to disturb the existing layout.

Move the four most recently added fields to preserve the offsets of
the previously defined fields and reserve locations for the vmread and
vmwrite bitmaps, which will be used in the virtualization of VMCS
shadowing (to improve the performance of double-nesting).
