nds32: consolidate DMA cache maintainance routines

Make sure all other DMA methods call nds32_dma_sync_single_for_{device,cpu}
to perform cache maintaince, and remove the consisteny_sync helper that
implemented both with entirely separate code based off an argument.

Also make sure these helpers handled highmem properly, for which code
is copy and pasted from mips.
