drm/i915: Use seqlock in engine stats

We can convert engine stats from a spinlock to seqlock to ensure interrupt
processing is never even a tiny bit delayed by parallel readers.

There is a smidgen bit more cost on the write lock side, and an extremely
unlikely chance that readers will have to retry a few times in face of
heavy interrupt load. But it should be extremely unlikely given how
lightweight read side section is compared to the interrupt processing
side, and also compared to the rest of the code paths which can lead into
it. Furthermore, writer is the ones doing the real, latency sensitive
work, while readers are only informative.
