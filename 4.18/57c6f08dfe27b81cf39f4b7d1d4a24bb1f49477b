staging: ks7010: move tx and rx queues definitions into ks_wlan.h header

There are some definitions for rx and tx queues in ks7010_sdio
which is not the best place to put them. Changing them into the
ks_wlan header file there is no need to explicity include ks7010_sdio.h
which makes no sense at all and can be resolved easily using
forward declarations. The functions related with the queues circular
buffers have been moved also into this header.
