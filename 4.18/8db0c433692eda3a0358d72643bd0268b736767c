regulatory: Rename confusing 'country IE' in log output

The 'country IE' messages in the log can be confusing and make people think
that the country code has been set to Ireland. Fix this by changing the
log messages to use 'country element' instead (as they are no longer called
'information element' in the spec anyway).
