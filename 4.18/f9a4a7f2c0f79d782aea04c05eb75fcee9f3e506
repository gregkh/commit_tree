scsi: qedf: Remove setting DCBX pending during soft context reset

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

According to the logs, STAG was changing and it was triggering soft
reset.  In soft reset we used to virtual link down and up and also we
were disabling DCBx flag. Since this was virtual link flap, DCBx never
used to converge again.

SOLUTION:

Code change is to remove disabling DCBx flag from soft reset.
