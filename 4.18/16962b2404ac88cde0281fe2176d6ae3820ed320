bpf: sockmap, add selftests

This adds a new test program test_sockmap which is the old sample
sockmap program. By moving the sample program here we can now run it
as part of the self tests suite. To support this a populate_progs()
routine is added to load programs and maps which was previously done
with load_bpf_file(). This is needed because self test libs do not
provide a similar routine. Also we now use the cgroup_helpers
routines to manage cgroup use instead of manually creating one and
supplying it to the CLI.

Notice we keep the CLI around though because it is useful for dbg
and specialized testing.

To run use ./test_sockmap and the result should be,

Summary 660 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED
