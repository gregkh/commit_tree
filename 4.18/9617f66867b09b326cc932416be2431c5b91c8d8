net: hns3: Fix for phy not link up problem after resetting

When resetting, phy_state_machine may be accessing the phy through
firmware if the phy is not stopped or disconnected, which will
cause firemware timeout problem because the firmware is busy
processing the reset request.

This patch fixes it by disabling the phy when resetting.
