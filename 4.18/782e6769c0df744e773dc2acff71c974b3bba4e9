dma-mapping: provide a generic dma-noncoherent implementation

Add a new dma_map_ops implementation that uses dma-direct for the
address mapping of streaming mappings, and which requires arch-specific
implemenations of coherent allocate/free.

Architectures have to provide flushing helpers to ownership trasnfers
to the device and/or CPU, and can provide optional implementations of
the coherent mmap functionality, and the cache_flush routines for
non-coherent long term allocations.
