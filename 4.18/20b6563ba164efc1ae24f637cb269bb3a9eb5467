IB/uverbs: Expose GRE flow spec to the user-kernel ABI header

Add ib_uverbs_flow_spec_gre to define a rule to match the GRE
encapsulation protocol.

The spec includes the generic specs header, type, size and reserved
fields while the filter itself is defined as ib_uverbs_flow_gre_filter
and includes:
1. Checksum present bit, key present bit and version bits in a single
   16bit field.
2. Protocol type field - Indicates the ether protocol type of the
   encapsulated payload.
3. Key field - present if key bit is set and contains an application
   specific key value.
