ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix pop noise on Lenovo P50 & co

Some Lenovo laptops, e.g. Lenovo P50, showed the pop noise at resume
or runtime resume.  It turned out to be reduced by applying
alc_no_shutup() just like TPT440 quirk does.

Since there are many Lenovo models showing the same behavior, put this
workaround in ALC269_FIXUP_THINKPAD_ACPI entry so that it's applied
commonly to all such Lenovo machines.
