bpfilter: fix building without CONFIG_INET

bpfilter_process_sockopt is a callback that gets called from
ip_setsockopt() and ip_getsockopt(). However, when CONFIG_INET is
disabled, it never gets called at all, and assigning a function to the
callback pointer results in a link failure:

net/bpfilter/bpfilter_kern.o: In function `__stop_umh':
bpfilter_kern.c:(.text.unlikely+0x3): undefined reference to `bpfilter_process_sockopt'
net/bpfilter/bpfilter_kern.o: In function `load_umh':
bpfilter_kern.c:(.init.text+0x73): undefined reference to `bpfilter_process_sockopt'

Since there is no caller in this configuration, I assume we can
simply make the assignment conditional.
