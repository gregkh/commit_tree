ixgbe: Avoid performing unnecessary resets for macvlan offload

The original implementation for macvlan offload has us performing a full
port reset every time we added a new macvlan. This shouldn't be necessary
and can be avoided with a few behavior changes.

This patches updates the logic for the queues so that we have essentially 3
possible configurations for macvlan offload. They consist of 15 macvlans
with 4 queues per macvlan, 31 macvlans with 2 queues per macvlan, and 63
macvlans with 1 queue per macvlan. As macvlans are added you will encounter
up to 3 total resets if you add all the way up to 63, and after that the
device will stay in the mode supporting up to 63 macvlans until the L2FW
flag is cleared.
