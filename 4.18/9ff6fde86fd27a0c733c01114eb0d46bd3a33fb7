wcn36xx: use READ_ONCE() to access desc->ctrl

When accessing shared memory to check for the stat of submitted
descriptors, make sure to use READ_ONCE(). This will guarantee the
compiler treats these memory locations as volatile and doesn't apply
any caching.

While this doesn't fix any particular problem I ran into, it's best
practice to do it this way.

Note that this patch also removes the superflous extra condition check
in the do-while loop in reap_tx_dxes(), as the loop will break
instantly anyway in that case.
