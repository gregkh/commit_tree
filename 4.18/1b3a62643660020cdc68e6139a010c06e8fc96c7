x86/boot/compressed/64: Validate trampoline placement against E820

There were two report of boot failure cased by trampoline placed into
a reserved memory region. It can happen on machines that don't report
EBDA correctly.

Fix the problem by re-validating the found address against the E820 table.
If the address is in a reserved area, find the next usable region below the
initial address.
