staging: lustre: remove libcfs/linux/libcfs.h

This include file is only included in one place,
and only contains a list of other include directives.
So just move all those to the place where this file
is included, and discard the file.

One include directive uses a local name ("linux-cpu.h"), so
that needs to be given a proper path.

Probably many of these should be remove from here, and moved to
just the files that need them.
