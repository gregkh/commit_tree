ipconfig: Correctly initialise ic_nameservers

ic_nameservers, which stores the list of name servers discovered by
ipconfig, is initialised (i.e. has all of its elements set to NONE, or
0xffffffff) by ic_nameservers_predef() in the following scenarios:

 - before the "ip=" and "nfsaddrs=" kernel command line parameters are
   parsed (in ip_auto_config_setup());
 - before autoconfiguring via DHCP or BOOTP (in ic_bootp_init()), in
   order to clear any values that may have been set after parsing "ip="
   or "nfsaddrs=" and are no longer needed.

This means that ic_nameservers_predef() is not called when neither "ip="
nor "nfsaddrs=" is specified on the kernel command line. In this
scenario, every element in ic_nameservers remains set to 0x00000000,
which is indistinguishable from ANY and causes pnp_seq_show() to write
the following (bogus) information to /proc/net/pnp:

  #MANUAL
  nameserver 0.0.0.0
  nameserver 0.0.0.0
  nameserver 0.0.0.0

This is potentially problematic for systems that blindly link
/etc/resolv.conf to /proc/net/pnp.

Ensure that ic_nameservers is also initialised when neither "ip=" nor
"nfsaddrs=" are specified by calling ic_nameservers_predef() in
ip_auto_config(), but only when ip_auto_config_setup() was not called
earlier. This causes the following to be written to /proc/net/pnp, and
is consistent with what gets written when ipconfig is configured
manually but no name servers are specified on the kernel command line:

  #MANUAL
