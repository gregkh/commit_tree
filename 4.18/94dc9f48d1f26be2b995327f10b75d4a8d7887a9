arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Use UFS_GDSC for UFS

The UFS host controller occationally (20%) fails to enable
gcc_ufs_axi_clk because the UFS GDSC is not enabled. In most cases it's
enabled through the UFS phy driver, but to make sure it's enabled let's
enable it directly from the UFS host controller directly as well.
