selftests/bpf: test_sockmap, fix data verification

When data verification is enabled, some tests fail because verification is done
incorrectly. Following changes fix it.

- Identify the size of data block to be verified
- Reset verification counter when data block size is reached
- Fixed the value printed in case of verfication failure
