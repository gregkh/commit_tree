regulator: s2mps11: Fix boot on Odroid XU3

The change to descriptors in 0369e02b75 "regulator: s2mps11: Pass
descriptor instead of GPIO number" has broken the boot on Odroid XU3
according to kernelci so let's revert that for now.  We get a NULL
pointer defererence in:

[    2.467929] [] (validate_desc) from [] (gpiod_set_value_cansleep+0x14/0x30)
[    2.476591] [] (gpiod_set_value_cansleep) from [] (_regulator_do_enable+0x2f8/0x370)
[    2.486032] [] (_regulator_do_enable) from [] (regulator_register+0xc54/0x1280)
[    2.495045] [] (regulator_register) from [] (devm_regulator_register+0x40/0x7c)
[    2.504057] [] (devm_regulator_register) from [] (s2mps11_pmic_probe+0x1c0/0x444)
[    2.513243] [] (s2mps11_pmic_probe) from [] (platform_drv_probe+0x6c/0xa4)
