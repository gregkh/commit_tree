media: v4l: vsp1: Use vsp1_entity.pipe to check if entity belongs to a pipeline

The DRM pipeline handling code uses the entity's pipe list head to check
whether the entity is already included in a pipeline. This method is a
bit fragile in the sense that it uses list_empty() on a list_head that
is a list member. Replace it by a simpler check for the entity pipe
pointer.
