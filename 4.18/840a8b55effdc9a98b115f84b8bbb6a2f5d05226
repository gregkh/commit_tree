MIPS: perf: Use correct VPE ID when setting up VPE tracing

There are a couple of FIXME's in the perf code which state that
cpu_data[event->cpu].vpe_id reports 0 for both CPUs. This is no longer
the case, since the vpe_id is used extensively by SMP CPS.

VPE local counting gets around this by using smp_processor_id() instead.
As it happens this does work correctly to count events on the right VPE,
but relies on 2 assumptions:
a) Always having 2 VPEs / core.
b) The hardware only paying attention to the least significant bit of
the PERFCTL.VPEID field.
If either of these assumptions change then the incorrect VPEs events
will be counted.

Fix this by replacing smp_processor_id() with
cpu_vpe_id(&current_cpu_data), in the vpe_id() macro, and pass vpe_id()
to M_PERFCTL_VPEID() when setting up PERFCTL.VPEID. The FIXME's can also
be removed since they no longer apply.
