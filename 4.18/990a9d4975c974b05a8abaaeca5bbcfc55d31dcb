net/ncsi: prevent a couple array underflows

We recently refactored this code and introduced a static checker
warning.  Smatch complains that if cmd->index is zero then we would
underflow the arrays.  That's obviously true.

The question is whether we prevent cmd->index from being zero at a
different level.  I've looked at the code and I don't immediately see
a check for that.
