crypto: inside-secure - remove VLAs

This patch removes the use of VLAs to allocate requests on the stack, by
removing both SKCIPHER_REQUEST_ON_STACK and AHASH_REQUEST_ON_STACK. As
we still need to allocate requests on the stack to ease the creation of
invalidation requests a new, non-VLA, definition is used:
EIP197_REQUEST_ON_STACK.
