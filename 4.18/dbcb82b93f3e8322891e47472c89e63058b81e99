perf intel-pt: Fix sync_switch INTEL_PT_SS_NOT_TRACING

sync_switch is a facility to synchronize decoding more closely with the
point in the kernel when the context actually switched.

In one case, INTEL_PT_SS_NOT_TRACING state was not correctly
transitioning to INTEL_PT_SS_TRACING state due to a missing case clause.
Add it.
