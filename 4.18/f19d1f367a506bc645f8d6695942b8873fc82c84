KVM: PPC: Fix a mmio_host_swabbed uninitialized usage issue

When KVM emulates VMX store, it will invoke kvmppc_get_vmx_data() to
retrieve VMX reg val. kvmppc_get_vmx_data() will check mmio_host_swabbed
to decide which double word of vr[] to be used. But the
mmio_host_swabbed can be uninitialized during VMX store procedure:

kvmppc_emulate_loadstore
	\- kvmppc_handle_store128_by2x64
		\- kvmppc_get_vmx_data

So vcpu->arch.mmio_host_swabbed is not meant to be used at all for
emulation of store instructions, and this patch makes that true for
VMX stores. This patch also initializes mmio_host_swabbed to avoid
possible future problems.
