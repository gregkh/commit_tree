media: ddbridge: request/free_irq using pci_irq_vector, enable MSI-X

Instead of trying to manage IRQ numbers on itself, utilise the
pci_irq_vector() function to do this, which will take care of correct IRQ
numbering for MSI and non-MSI IRQs. While at it, request and enable MSI-X
interrupts for hardware (boards and cards) that support this.

Picked up from the upstream dddvb-0.9.33 release.
