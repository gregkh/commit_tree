ipv6: mcast: fix unsolicited report interval after receiving querys

After recieving MLD querys, we update idev->mc_maxdelay with max_delay
from query header. This make the later unsolicited reports have the same
interval with mc_maxdelay, which means we may send unsolicited reports with
long interval time instead of default configured interval time.

Also as we will not call ipv6_mc_reset() after device up. This issue will
be there even after leave the group and join other groups.
