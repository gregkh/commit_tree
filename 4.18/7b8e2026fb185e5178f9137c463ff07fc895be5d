staging: lustre: remove conditional compilation from libcfs_cpu.c

libcfs_cpu.c manages CPU partitions.  In the !CONFIG_SMP case, most
of this disappears and 'static inline's from libcfs_cpu.h are used.
However we still allocate a 'struct cfs_cpt_table' and keep some
dummy data in it.  This is a bit pointless.

This patch removes all the !CONFIG_SMP code from libcfs_cpu.c and
conditionally compiles the whole file only when CONFIG_SMP.
We no longer allocate a 'struct cfs_cpt_table' on !CONFIG_SMP,
and don't even declare a structure.  The name "cfs_cpt_tab"
becomes always "NULL", which allows some code to be optimized away.

This means that cfs_cpt_tab can sometimes be NULL, so we need to
discard the assertion that it isn't.
