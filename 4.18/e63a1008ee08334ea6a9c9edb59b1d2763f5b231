xfs: strengthen btree pointer checks before use

Instead of ASSERTing on null btree pointers in xfs_btree_ptr_to_daddr,
use the new block number verifiers to ensure that the btree pointer
doesn't point to any sensitive areas (AG headers, past-EOFS) and return
-EFSCORRUPTED if this is the case.  Remove the ASSERT because on-disk
corruptions shouldn't trigger ASSERTs.
