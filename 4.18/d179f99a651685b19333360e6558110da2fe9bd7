usbip: usbip_detach: Fix memory, udev context and udev leak

detach_port() fails to call usbip_vhci_driver_close() from its error
path after usbip_vhci_detach_device() returns failure, leaking memory
allocated in usbip_vhci_driver_open() and holding udev_context and udev
references. Fix it to call usbip_vhci_driver_close().
