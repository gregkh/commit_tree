media: vsp1: Move video suspend resume handling to video object

The suspend and resume handlers are only utilised by video pipelines,
yet the functions currently reside in the vsp1_pipe object.

This causes an issue with resume, as the functions incorrectly call
vsp1_pipeline_run() directly instead of processing the video object
through vsp1_video_pipeline_run().

Move the functions to the video object, renaming accordingly and update
the resume handler to call vsp1_video_pipeline_run() as appropriate.
