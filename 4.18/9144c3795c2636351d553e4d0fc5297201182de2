net-next: ax88796: Do not free IRQ in ax_remove() (already freed in ax_close()).

This complements the fix in 82533ad9a1c ("net: ethernet: ax88796:
don't call free_irq without request_irq first") that removed the
free_irq call in the error path of probe, to also not call free_irq
when remove is called to revert the effects of probe.
