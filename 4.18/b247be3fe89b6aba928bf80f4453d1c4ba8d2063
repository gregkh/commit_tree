locking/qspinlock/x86: Increase _Q_PENDING_LOOPS upper bound

On x86, atomic_cond_read_relaxed will busy-wait with a cpu_relax() loop,
so it is desirable to increase the number of times we spin on the qspinlock
lockword when it is found to be transitioning from pending to locked.

According to Waiman Long:

 | Ideally, the spinning times should be at least a few times the typical
 | cacheline load time from memory which I think can be down to 100ns or
 | so for each cacheline load with the newest systems or up to several
 | hundreds ns for older systems.

which in his benchmarking corresponded to 512 iterations.
