acpi, nfit: Remove ecc_unit_size

The "Clear Error Unit" may be smaller than the ECC unit size on some
devices. For example, poison may be tracked at 64-byte alignment even
though the ECC unit is larger. Unless / until the ACPI specification
provides a non-ambiguous way to communicate this property do not expose
this to userspace.

Software that had been using this property must already be prepared for
the case where the property is not provided on older kernels, so it is
safe to remove this attribute.
