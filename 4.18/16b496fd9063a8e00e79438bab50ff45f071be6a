net: hns3: Remove unused led control code

In the previous implementation of led control for fibre port , parses the
port speed configuration, checks the link status and traffic status per
second, and updates the blink status of link led, traffic led and speed
led.

Now, the firmware takes responsibility to handle the led, the dirver just
needs to deal with locate command.

So the codes for link led, traffic led and speed led are useless now. This
patch removes these redundant codes.
