reiserfs: fix buffer overflow with long warning messages

ReiserFS prepares log messages into a 1024-byte buffer with no bounds
checks.  Long messages, such as the "unknown mount option" warning when
userspace passes a crafted mount options string, overflow this buffer.
This causes KASAN to report a global-out-of-bounds write.

Fix it by truncating messages to the buffer size.
