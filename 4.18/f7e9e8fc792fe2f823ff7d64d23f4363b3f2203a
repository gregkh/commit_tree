Btrfs: stop creating orphan items for truncate

Currently, we insert an orphan item during a truncate so that if there's
a crash, we don't leak extents past the on-disk i_size. However, since
commit 7f4f6e0a3f6d ("Btrfs: only update disk_i_size as we remove
extents"), we keep disk_i_size in sync with the extent items as we
truncate, so orphan cleanup will never have any extents to remove. Don't
bother with the superfluous orphan item.
