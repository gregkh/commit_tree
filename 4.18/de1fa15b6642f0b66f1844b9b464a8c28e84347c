ipconfig: BOOTP: Request CONF_NAMESERVERS_MAX name servers

When ipconfig is autoconfigured via BOOTP, the request packet
initialised by ic_bootp_init_ext() always allocates 8 bytes for the name
server option, limiting the BOOTP server to responding with at most 2
name servers even though ipconfig in fact supports an arbitrary number
of name servers (as defined by CONF_NAMESERVERS_MAX, which is currently
3).

Only request name servers in the request packet if CONF_NAMESERVERS_MAX
is positive (to comply with [1, ยง3.8]), and allocate enough space in the
packet for CONF_NAMESERVERS_MAX name servers to indicate the maximum
number we can accept in response.
