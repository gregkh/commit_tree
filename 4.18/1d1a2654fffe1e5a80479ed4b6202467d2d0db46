perf machine: Remove needless map_type from machine__load_vmlinux_path()

Since it uses machine__kernel_map() and this function always returns the
MAP__FUNCTION map, it doesn't make sense to call it with MAP__VARIABLE.

And also this is a step in the direction of nuking the MAP__{FUNCTION,VARIABLE}
split.
