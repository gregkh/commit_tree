xhci: xhci-hub: use new port structures to get port address instead of port array

Use the new port structures for functions in xhci-hub.c to get
port mmio address of portsc register instead of the port array

xhci_get_port_io_addr() is no longer needeed and is removed.
Plan is to get rid of the mmio port array completely.
