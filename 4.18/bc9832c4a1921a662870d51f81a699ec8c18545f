USB: typec: fsusb302: no need to check return value of debugfs_create_dir()

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

Clean up the fsusb302 driver to not care if the root directory was
created, as the code should work properly either way.
