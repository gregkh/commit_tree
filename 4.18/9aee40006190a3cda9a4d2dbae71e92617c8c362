tcp: ack immediately when a cwr packet arrives

We observed high 99 and 99.9% latencies when doing RPCs with DCTCP. The
problem is triggered when the last packet of a request arrives CE
marked. The reply will carry the ECE mark causing TCP to shrink its cwnd
to 1 (because there are no packets in flight). When the 1st packet of
the next request arrives, the ACK was sometimes delayed even though it
is CWR marked, adding up to 40ms to the RPC latency.

This patch insures that CWR marked data packets arriving will be acked
immediately.

Packetdrill script to reproduce the problem:

0.000 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0
0.000 setsockopt(3, SOL_TCP, TCP_CONGESTION, "dctcp", 5) = 0
0.000 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0
0.000 listen(3, 1) = 0
