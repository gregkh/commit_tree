net: hns3: Optimize PF CMDQ interrupt switching process

When the PF frequently switches the CMDQ interrupt, if the CMDQ_SRC is
not cleared before the hardware interrupt is generated, the new interrupt
will not be reported.

This patch optimizes this problem by clearing CMDQ_SRC and RESET_STS
before enabling interrupt and syncing pending IRQ handlers after disabling
interrupt.
