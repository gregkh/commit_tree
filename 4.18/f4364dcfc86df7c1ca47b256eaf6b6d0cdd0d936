media: rc: introduce BPF_PROG_LIRC_MODE2

Add support for BPF_PROG_LIRC_MODE2. This type of BPF program can call
rc_keydown() to reported decoded IR scancodes, or rc_repeat() to report
that the last key should be repeated.

The bpf program can be attached to using the bpf(BPF_PROG_ATTACH) syscall;
the target_fd must be the /dev/lircN device.
