scsi: hisi_sas: update PHY linkrate after a controller reset

After the controller is reset, we currently may not honour the PHY max
linkrate set via sysfs, in that after a reset we always revert to max
linkrate of 12Gbps, ignoring the value set via sysfs.

This patch modifies to policy to set the programmed PHY linkrate,
honouring the max linkrate programmed via sysfs.
