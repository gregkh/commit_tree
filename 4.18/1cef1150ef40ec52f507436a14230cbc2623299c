kthread, sched/core: Fix kthread_parkme() (again...)

Gaurav reports that commit:

  85f1abe0019f ("kthread, sched/wait: Fix kthread_parkme() completion issue")

isn't working for him. Because of the following race:

Furthermore, Oleg noticed that the whole scheduler TASK_PARKED
handling is buggered because the TASK_DEAD thing is done with
preemption disabled, the current code can still complete early on
preemption :/

So basically revert that earlier fix and go with a variant of the
alternative mentioned in the commit. Promote TASK_PARKED to special
state to avoid the store-store issue on task->state leading to the
WARN in kthread_unpark() -> __kthread_bind().

But in addition, add wait_task_inactive() to kthread_park() to ensure
the task really is PARKED when we return from kthread_park(). This
avoids the whole kthread still gets migrated nonsense -- although it
would be really good to get this done differently.
