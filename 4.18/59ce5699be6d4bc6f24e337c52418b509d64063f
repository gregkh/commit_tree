Bluetooth: btbcm: Remove duplicate code from btbcm_setup_patchram()

btbcm_setup_patchram() starts with initializing the controller (and
getting the firmware filename) and then after loading the firmware,
does a re-init. This almost entirely duplicates the code in
btbcm_initialize(), use that function instead.
