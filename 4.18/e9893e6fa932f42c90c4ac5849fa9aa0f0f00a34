mtd: rawnand: fix return value check for bad block status

Positive return value from read_oob() is making false BAD
blocks. For some of the NAND controllers, OOB bytes will be
protected with ECC and read_oob() will return number of bitflips.
If there is any bitflip in ECC protected OOB bytes for BAD block
status page, then that block is getting treated as BAD.
