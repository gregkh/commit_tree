cifs: fix SMB1 breakage

SMB1 mounting broke in commit 35e2cc1ba755
("cifs: Use correct packet length in SMB2_TRANSFORM header")
Fix it and also rename smb2_rqst_len to smb_rqst_len
to make it less unobvious that the function is also called from
CIFS/SMB1

Good job by Paulo reviewing and cleaning up Ronnie's original patch.
