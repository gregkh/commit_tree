scsi: sg: mitigate read/write abuse

As Al Viro noted in commit 128394eff343 ("sg_write()/bsg_write() is not fit
to be called under KERNEL_DS"), sg improperly accesses userspace memory
outside the provided buffer, permitting kernel memory corruption via
splice().  But it doesn't just do it on ->write(), also on ->read().

As a band-aid, make sure that the ->read() and ->write() handlers can not
be called in weird contexts (kernel context or credentials different from
file opener), like for ib_safe_file_access().

If someone needs to use these interfaces from different security contexts,
a new interface should be written that goes through the ->ioctl() handler.

I've mostly copypasted ib_safe_file_access() over as sg_safe_file_access()
because I couldn't find a good common header - please tell me if you know a
better way.
