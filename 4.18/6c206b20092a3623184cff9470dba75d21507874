udp: fix rx queue len reported by diag and proc interface

After commit 6b229cf77d68 ("udp: add batching to udp_rmem_release()")
the sk_rmem_alloc field does not measure exactly anymore the
receive queue length, because we batch the rmem release. The issue
is really apparent only after commit 0d4a6608f68c ("udp: do rmem bulk
free even if the rx sk queue is empty"): the user space can easily
check for an empty socket with not-0 queue length reported by the 'ss'
tool or the procfs interface.

We need to use a custom UDP helper to report the correct queue length,
taking into account the forward allocation deficit.
