net: qrtr: Expose tunneling endpoint to user space

This implements a misc character device named "qrtr-tun" for the purpose
of allowing user space applications to implement endpoints in the qrtr
network.

This allows more advanced (and dynamic) testing of the qrtr code as well
as opens up the ability of tunneling qrtr over a network or USB link.
