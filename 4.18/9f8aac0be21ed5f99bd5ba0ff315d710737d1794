netfilter: nf_tables: fix memory leaks on chain rename

The new name is stored in the transaction metadata, on commit,
the pointers to the old and new names are swapped.

Therefore in abort and commit case we have to free the
pointer in the chain_trans container.

In commit case, the pointer can be used by another cpu that
is currently dumping the renamed chain, thus kfree needs to
happen after waiting for rcu readers to complete.
