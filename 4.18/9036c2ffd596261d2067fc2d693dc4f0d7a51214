rcu: Improve non-root rcu_cbs_completed() accuracy

When rcu_cbs_completed() is invoked on a non-root rcu_node structure,
it unconditionally assumes that two grace periods must complete before
the callbacks at hand can be invoked.  This is overly conservative because
if that non-root rcu_node structure believes that no grace period is in
progress, and if the corresponding rcu_state structure's ->gpnum field
has not yet been incremented, then these callbacks may safely be invoked
after only one grace period has completed.

This change is required to permit grace-period start requests to use
funnel locking, which is in turn permitted to reduce root rcu_node ->lock
contention, which has been observed by Nick Piggin.  Furthermore, such
contention will likely be increased by the merging of RCU-bh, RCU-preempt,
and RCU-sched, so it makes sense to take steps to decrease it.

This commit therefore improves the accuracy of rcu_cbs_completed() when
invoked on a non-root rcu_node structure as described above.
