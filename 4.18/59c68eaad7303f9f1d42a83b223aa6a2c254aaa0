scsi: lpfc: Fix Abort request WQ selection

When running loads that generated aborts, io errors where seen.  Turns
out the abort requests where not placed on the proper WQ resulting in
the errors. Closer inspection inspection of this error also showed
improper spinlock api use.

Correct the WQ selection policy for the abort requests.  Correct
spin_lock/spin_lock_irq/spin_lock_irqsave usage.
