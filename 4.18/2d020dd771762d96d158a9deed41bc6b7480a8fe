bpf: add documentation for eBPF helpers (65-66)

Add documentation for eBPF helper functions to bpf.h user header file.
This documentation can be parsed with the Python script provided in
another commit of the patch series, in order to provide a RST document
that can later be converted into a man page.

The objective is to make the documentation easily understandable and
accessible to all eBPF developers, including beginners.

This patch contains descriptions for the following helper functions:

Helper from Nikita:
- bpf_xdp_adjust_tail()

Helper from Eyal:
- bpf_skb_get_xfrm_state()

v4:
- New patch (helpers did not exist yet for previous versions).
