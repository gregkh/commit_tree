s390: use _refcount for pgtables

Patch series "Rearrange struct page", v6.

As presented at LSFMM, this patch-set rearranges struct page to give
more contiguous usable space to users who have allocated a struct page
for their own purposes.  For a graphical view of before-and-after, see
the first two tabs of

Highlights:
 - deferred_list now really exists in struct page instead of just a comment.
 - hmm_data also exists in struct page instead of being a nasty hack.
 - x86's PGD pages have a real pointer to the mm_struct.
 - VMalloc pages now have all sorts of extra information stored in them
   to help with debugging and tuning.
 - rcu_head is no longer tied to slab in case anyone else wants to
   free pages by RCU.
 - slub's counters no longer share space with _refcount.
 - slub's freelist+counters are now naturally dword aligned.
 - slub loses a parameter to a lot of functions and a sysfs file.

This patch (of 17):

s390 borrows the storage used for _mapcount in struct page in order to
account whether the bottom or top half is being used for 2kB page tables.
I want to use that for something else, so use the top byte of _refcount
instead of the bottom byte of _mapcount.  _refcount may temporarily be
incremented by other CPUs that see a stale pointer to this page in the
page cache, but each CPU can only increment it by one, and there are no
systems with 2^24 CPUs today, so they will not change the upper byte of
_refcount.  We do have to be a little careful not to lose any of their
writes (as they will subsequently decrement the counter).
