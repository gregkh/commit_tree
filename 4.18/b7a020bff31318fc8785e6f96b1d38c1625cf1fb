mei: discard messages from not connected client during power down.

This fixes regression introduced by
commit 8d52af6795c0 ("mei: speed up the power down flow")

In power down or suspend flow a message can still be received
from the FW because the clients fake disconnection.
In normal case we interpret messages w/o destination as corrupted
and link reset is performed in order to clean the channel,
but during power down link reset is already in progress resulting
in endless loop. To resolve the issue under power down flow we
discard messages silently.
