arm64: topology: enable ACPI/PPTT based CPU topology

Propagate the topology information from the PPTT tree to the
cpu_topology array. We can get the thread id and core_id by assuming
certain levels of the PPTT tree correspond to those concepts.
The package_id is flagged in the tree and can be found by calling
find_acpi_cpu_topology_package() which terminates
its search when it finds an ACPI node flagged as the physical
package. If the tree doesn't contain enough levels to represent
all of the requested levels then the root node will be returned
for all subsequent levels.
