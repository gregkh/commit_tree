scsi: cxlflash: Support AFU reset

The cxlflash core driver resets the AFU when the master contexts are created
in the initialization or recovery paths. Today, the OCXL provider service to
perform this operation is pending implementation.  To avoid a crash due to a
missing fop, log an error once and return success to continue with execution.
