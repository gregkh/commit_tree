net, mm: account sock objects to kmemcg

Currently the kernel accounts the memory for network traffic through
mem_cgroup_[un]charge_skmem() interface. However the memory accounted
only includes the truesize of sk_buff which does not include the size of
sock objects. In our production environment, with opt-out kmem
accounting, the sock kmem caches (TCP[v6], UDP[v6], RAW[v6], UNIX) are
among the top most charged kmem caches and consume a significant amount
of memory which can not be left as system overhead. So, this patch
converts the kmem caches of all sock objects to SLAB_ACCOUNT.
