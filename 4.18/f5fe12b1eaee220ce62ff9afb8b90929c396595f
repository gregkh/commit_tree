ARM: spectre-v2: harden user aborts in kernel space

In order to prevent aliasing attacks on the branch predictor,
invalidate the BTB or instruction cache on CPUs that are known to be
affected when taking an abort on a address that is outside of a user
task limit:

Cortex A8, A9, A12, A17, A73, A75: flush BTB.
Cortex A15, Brahma B15: invalidate icache.

If the IBE bit is not set, then there is little point to enabling the
workaround.
