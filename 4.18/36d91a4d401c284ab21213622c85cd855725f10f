rtc: cmos: introduce quirks to enable use_acpi_alarm mode

Use ACPI for RTC Alarm only for Intel platforms
1. with Low Power S0 support
2. with HPET RTC emulation enabled
3. no earlier than 2015

Note that, during the test, it is found that this patch
1. works in 4.15-rc kernel
2. hangs the platform after suspend-to-idle for 2 or 3 times, in 4.15.0
3. works again in 4.16-rc3 kernel.
4. works in the latest 4.15.12 stable kernel.

Thus although this patch breaks 4.15.0 kernel for some unknown reason,
still, it is safe for both upstream and backport.
