mwifiex: correct p2p and station interface counters

While changing interface type from p2p client or p2p go to
station, we should update counters for p2p interface and
station interface. Also calling mwifiex_cfg80211_deinit_p2p
method instead of mwifiex_cfg80211_init_p2p_client method to
deinit p2p interface.
