batman-adv: Fix gw_bandwidth calculation on 32 bit systems

The TVLV for the gw_bandwidth stores everything as u32. But the
gw_bandwidth reads the signed long which limits the maximum value to
(2 ** 31 - 1) on systems with 4 byte long. Also the input value is always
converted from either Mibit/s or Kibit/s to 100Kibit/s. This reduces the
values even further when the user sets it via the default unit Kibit/s. It
may even cause an integer overflow and end up with a value the user never
intended.

Instead read the values as u64, check for possible overflows, do the unit
adjustments and then reduce the size to u32.
