perf tools: Add empty Build files for architectures lacking them

perf currently fails to build on MIPS as there is no
tools/perf/arch/mips/Build file.  Adding an empty file fixes this as
there are no MIPS-specific sources to build.

It looks like the same is needed for Alpha and PA-RISC, though I
haven't been able to test those.
