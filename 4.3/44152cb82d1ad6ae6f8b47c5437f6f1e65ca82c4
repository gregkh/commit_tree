cpufreq: governor: Keep single copy of information common to policy->cpus

Some information is common to all CPUs belonging to a policy, but are
kept on per-cpu basis. Lets keep that in another structure common to all
policy->cpus. That will make updates/reads to that less complex and less
error prone.

The memory for cpu_common_dbs_info is allocated/freed at INIT/EXIT, so
that it we don't reallocate it for STOP/START sequence. It will be also
be used (in next patch) while the governor is stopped and so must not be
freed that early.
