drm/irq: Remove negative CRTC index special-case

The drm_send_vblank_event() function treats negative CRTC indices as
meaning that a driver doesn't have proper VBLANK handling. This is the
only place where DRM needs negative CRTC indices, so in order to enable
subsequent cleanup, remove this special case and replace it by the more
obvious check for whether or not VBLANK support was initialized.
