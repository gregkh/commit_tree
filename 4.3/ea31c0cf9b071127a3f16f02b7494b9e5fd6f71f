mfd: atmel-hlcdc: Implement config synchronization

Some HLCDC registers cannot be written until the hardware has finished
applying the previous configuration request. If they are written while
an action is still in progress, the new configuration might be silently
ignored, resulting in unpredictable behavior.

Hide the config synchronization stuff in a regmap implementation and use
this implementation instead of the generic mmio one.
