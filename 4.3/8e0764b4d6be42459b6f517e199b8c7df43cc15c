i40e/i40evf: Add support for writeback on ITR feature for X722

X722 fixes an issue from X710 where TX descriptor WB would not happen if
the interrupts were disabled. In order for the write backs to happen a
bit needs to be set in the dynamic interrupt control register called
WB_ON_ITR. With this feature, the SW driver need not arm SW interrupts to
work around the issue in X710.
