md: set MD_RECOVERY_RECOVER when starting a degraded array.

This ensures that 'sync_action' will show 'recover' immediately the
array is started.  If there is no spare the status will change to
'idle' once that is detected.

Clear MD_RECOVERY_RECOVER for a read-only array to ensure this change
happens.

This allows scripts which monitor status not to get confused -
particularly my test scripts.
