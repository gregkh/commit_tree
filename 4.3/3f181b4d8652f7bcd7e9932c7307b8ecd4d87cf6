lib/Kconfig.debug: disable -Wframe-larger-than warnings with KASAN=y

When the kernel compiled with KASAN=y, GCC adds redzones for each
variable on stack.  This enlarges function's stack frame and causes:

	'warning: the frame size of X bytes is larger than Y bytes'

The worst case I've seen for now is following:

   ../net/wireless/nl80211.c: In function `nl80211_send_wiphy':
   ../net/wireless/nl80211.c:1731:1: warning: the frame size of 5448 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

That kind of warning becomes useless with KASAN=y.  It doesn't
necessarily indicate that there is some problem in the code, thus we
should turn it off.

(The KASAN=y stack size in increased from 16k to 32k for this reason)
