Btrfs: fix warning in backref walking

When we do backref walking, we search firstly in queued delayed refs
and then the on-disk backrefs, but we parse differently for shared
references, for delayed refs we also add 'ref->root' while for on-disk
backrefs we don't, this can prevent us from merging refs indexed
by the same bytenr and cause find_parent_nodes() to throw a warning at
'WARN_ON(ref->count < 0)', for example, when we have a shared data extent
with 'ref_cnt=1' and a delayed shared data with a BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF,
that happens.

For shared references, no matter if it's delayed or on-disk, ref->root is
not at all used, instead it's ref->parent that really matters, so this has
delayed refs handled as the same way as on-disk refs.
