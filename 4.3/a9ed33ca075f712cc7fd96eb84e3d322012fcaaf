drm/i915: Expose I915_EXEC_RESOURCE_STREAMER flag and getparam

Ensures that the batch buffer is executed by the resource streamer.
And will let userspace know whether Resource Streamer is supported in
the kernel.

v2: Don't skip 1<<15 for the exec flags (Jani Nikula)
v3: Use HAS_RESOURCE_STREAMER macro for execbuf validation (Chris Wilson)

(from getparam patch)

v2: Update I915_PARAM_HAS_RESOURCE_STREAMER so it's after
    I915_PARAM_HAS_GPU_RESET.
v3: Only advertise RS support for hardware that supports it.
v4: Add HAS_RESOURCE_STREAMER() macro (Chris)
