x86, efi, kasan: #undef memset/memcpy/memmove per arch

In not-instrumented code KASAN replaces instrumented memset/memcpy/memmove
with not-instrumented analogues __memset/__memcpy/__memove.

However, on x86 the EFI stub is not linked with the kernel.  It uses
not-instrumented mem*() functions from arch/x86/boot/compressed/string.c

So we don't replace them with __mem*() variants in EFI stub.

On ARM64 the EFI stub is linked with the kernel, so we should replace
mem*() functions with __mem*(), because the EFI stub runs before KASAN
sets up early shadow.

So let's move these #undef mem* into arch's asm/efi.h which is also
included by the EFI stub.

Also, this will fix the warning in 32-bit build reported by kbuild test
robot:

	efi-stub-helper.c:599:2: warning: implicit declaration of function 'memcpy'
