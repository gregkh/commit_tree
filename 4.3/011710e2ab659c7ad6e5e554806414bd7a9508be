spi: img-spfi: check for timeout error before proceeding

Calling spfi_wait_all_done is not required if the transfer has timed
out before all data is transferred.

spfi_wait_all_done polls for Alldone interrupt which is triggered to
mark the transfer as complete and to indicate it is now safe to issue
a new transfer.
