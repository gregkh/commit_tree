mm: make sure all file VMAs have ->vm_ops set

We rely on vma->vm_ops == NULL to detect anonymous VMA: see
vma_is_anonymous(), but some drivers doesn't set ->vm_ops.

As a result we can end up with anonymous page in private file mapping.
That should not lead to serious misbehaviour, but nevertheless is wrong.

Let's fix by setting up dummy ->vm_ops for file mmapping if f_op->mmap()
didn't set its own.

The patch also adds sanity check into __vma_link_rb(). It will help
catch broken VMAs which inserted directly into mm_struct via
insert_vm_struct().
