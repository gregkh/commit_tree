irqchip/gic-v3-its: Count additional LPIs for the aliased devices

When configuring the interrupt mapping for a new device, we
iterate over all the possible aliases to account for their
maximum MSI allocation. This was introduced by e8137f4f5088
("irqchip: gicv3-its: Iterate over PCI aliases to generate ITS configuration").

Turns out that the code doing that is a bit braindead, and repeatedly
accounts for the same device over and over.

Fix this by counting the actual alias that is passed to us by the
core code.
