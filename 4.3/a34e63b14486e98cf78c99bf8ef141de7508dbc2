cpufreq: Pass CPU number to cpufreq_policy_alloc()

Change cpufreq_policy_alloc() to take a CPU number instead of a CPU
device pointer as its argument, as it is the only function called by
cpufreq_add_dev() taking a device pointer argument at this point.

That will allow us to split the CPU online part from cpufreq_add_dev()
more cleanly going forward.
