6lowpan: add generic 6lowpan netdev private data

This patch introduced the 6lowpan netdev private data struct. We name it
lowpan_priv and it's placed at the beginning of netdev private data. All
lowpan interfaces should allocate this room at first of netdev private
data. 6LoWPAN LL private data can be allocate by additional netdev private
data, e.g. dev->priv_size should be "sizeof(struct lowpan_priv) +
sizeof(LL_LOWPAN_PRIVATE_DATA)".
