rcu: Create a synchronize_rcu_mult()

There have been several requests for a primitive that waits for
grace periods for several RCU flavors concurrently, so this
commit creates it.  This is a variadic macro, and you pass in
the call_rcu() functions of the flavors of RCU that you wish to
wait for.

Note that you cannot pass in call_srcu() for two reasons: (1) This
would result in a type mismatch and (2) You need to specify which
srcu_struct you want to use.  Handle this by creating a wrapper
function for your SRCU domain, for example:

	void call_srcu_mine(struct rcu_head *head, rcu_callback_t func)
	{
		call_srcu(&ss_mine, head, func);
	}

You can then do something like this:

	synchronize_rcu_mult(call_srcu_mine, call_rcu, call_rcu_sched);
