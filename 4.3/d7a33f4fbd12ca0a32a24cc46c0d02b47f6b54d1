arm64/debug: Add missing #includes

<asm/debug-monitors.h> relies on <asm/ptrace.h>, but doesn't
declare this dependency.  This becomes a problem once
debug-monitors.h starts getting included all over the place to get
the BRK immedates.

The missing include of <asm/memory.h> (for UL()) in <asm/esr.h> is
also added.  The series no longer relies on this, but I spotted it
during development and it may as well get fixed.

No functional change.
