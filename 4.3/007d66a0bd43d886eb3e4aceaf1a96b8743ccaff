perf trace: Write to stderr by default

Without this patch, it is cumbersome to read the trace output but
ignoring the normal, potentially verbose, output of the debuggee.  One
common example is doing something like the following:

 perf trace -s find /tmp > /dev/null

Without this patch, the trace summary will be lost. Now, it will still
be printed at the end. This behavior is also applied by strace.
