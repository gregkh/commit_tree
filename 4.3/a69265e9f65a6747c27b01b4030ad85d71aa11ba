cxgb4: Force uninitialized state if FW in adapter is unsupported

Forcing uninitialized state allows us to upgrade and reinitialize
the adapter.

    FW_VERSION_T4 = 1.4.0.0
    FW_VERSION_T5 = 0.0.0.0
    FW_VERSION_T6 = 0.0.0.0
At this point driver supports above and greater than above version.

If FW in adapter < min FW_VERSION driver supports tries to upgrade the FW
If FW in adapter >= FW_VERSION driver supports then it follows normal path
