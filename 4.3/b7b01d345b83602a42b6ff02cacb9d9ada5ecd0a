ASoC: imx-ssi: Fix DAI hardware signal inversions

SND_SOC_DAIFMT_{IB|NB}_{IF|NF} are defined as inverting or not BCLK or
FRM relatively to what is standard for the specified DAI hardware audio
format. Consequently, the absolute polarities of these signals cannot be
derived only from these settings as this driver did. The format has to
be taken into account too.

This fixes inverted left/right channels in I²S mode.
