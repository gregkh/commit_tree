drm/i915: Don't enable IPS when pixel rate exceeds 95%

Bspec says we shouldn't enable IPS on BDW when the pipe pixel rate
exceeds 95% of the core display clock. Apparently this can cause
underruns.

There's no similar restriction listed for HSW, so leave that one alone
for now.

v2: Add pipe_config_supports_ips() (Chris)
v3: Compare against the max cdclk insted of the current cdclk
v4: Rebased to the latest
v5: Rebased to the latest
v6: Fix for patch style problems
