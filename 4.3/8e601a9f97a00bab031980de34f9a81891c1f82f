cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix divide by zero on Knights Landing (KNL)

This is a workaround for KNL platform, where in some cases MPERF counter
will not have updated value before next read of MSR_IA32_MPERF. In this
case divide by zero will occur. This change ignores current sample for
busy calculation in this case.
