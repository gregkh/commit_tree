dsa: mv88e6352/mv88e6xxx: Move temperature sensor code to mv88e6xxx.c

Move the temperature sensing code for mv88e6352 and mv88e6320 families
into mv88e6xxx.c to simplify adding support for additional chips.

With this change, mv88e6xxx_6320_family() no longer needs to be
a global function and is made static.
