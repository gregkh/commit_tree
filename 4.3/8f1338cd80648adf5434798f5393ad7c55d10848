pinctrl: add support for Qualcomm Technologies QDF2xxx ARM64 SoCs

Add the pinctrl driver for the Qualcomm Technologies QDF2xxx ARM64 SoCs,
which uses the Qualcomm Technologies TLMM pinctrl/gpio device.  This
driver is probed via ACPI and uses the pinctrl-msm.c backend driver.

This driver is intended to be used only an ACPI-enabled system.  As such,
UEFI will handle all pin control configuration, so this driver does not
provide pin control functions.  It is effectively a GPIO-only driver.
