cpufreq: powernv: Report Psafe only if PMSR.psafe_mode_active bit is set

On a reset cycle of OCC, although the system retires from safe
frequency state the local pstate is not restored to Pmin or last
requested pstate. Now if the cpufreq governor initiates a pstate
change, the local pstate will be in Psafe and we will be reporting a
false positive when we are not throttled.

So in powernv_cpufreq_throttle_check() remove the condition which
checks if local pstate is less than Pmin while checking for Psafe
frequency. If the cpus are forced to Psafe then PMSR.psafe_mode_active
bit will be set. So, when OCCs become active this bit will be cleared.
Let us just rely on this bit for reporting throttling.
