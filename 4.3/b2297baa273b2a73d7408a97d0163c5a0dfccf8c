ath10k: add scan support for 10.4 fw

Existing non 10.4 firmware scan related events and commands are
matching with 10.4 firmware (except chan info event). Link general
start scan,stop scan, scan channel list configuration functions
to 10.4 wmi function table and add a new handler to parse 10.4
specific chan info event.

10.4 firmware has extra scan completion reason
WMI_SCAN_REASON_INTERNAL_FAILURE and new scan event
WMI_SCAN_EVENT_FOREIGN_CHANNEL_EXIT compared to previous firmware
versions. These things are added in respective enum.
