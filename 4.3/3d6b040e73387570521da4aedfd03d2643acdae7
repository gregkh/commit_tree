cxl: sparse: Make declarations static

A few declarations were identified by sparse as needing to be static:

  drivers/misc/cxl/irq.c:408:6: warning: symbol 'afu_irq_name_free' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/misc/cxl/irq.c:467:6: warning: symbol 'afu_register_hwirqs' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/misc/cxl/file.c:254:6: warning: symbol 'afu_compat_ioctl' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/misc/cxl/file.c:399:30: warning: symbol 'afu_master_fops' was not declared. Should it be static?

Make them static.
