KVM: fix polling for guest halt continued even if disable it

If there is already some polling ongoing, it's impossible to disable the
polling, since as soon as somebody sets halt_poll_ns to 0, polling will
never stop, as grow and shrink are only handled if halt_poll_ns is != 0.

This patch fix it by reset vcpu->halt_poll_ns in order to stop polling
when polling is disabled.
