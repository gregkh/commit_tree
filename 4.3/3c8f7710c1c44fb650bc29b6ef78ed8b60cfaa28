ASoC: fix broken pxa SoC support

The previous fix of pxa library support, which was introduced to fix the
library dependency, broke the previous SoC behavior, where a machine
code binding pxa2xx-ac97 with a coded relied on :
 - sound/soc/pxa/pxa2xx-ac97.c
 - sound/soc/codecs/XXX.c

For example, the mioa701_wm9713.c machine code is currently broken. The
"select ARM" statement wrongly selects the soc/arm/pxa2xx-ac97 for
compilation, as per an unfortunate fate SND_PXA2XX_AC97 is both declared
in sound/arm/Kconfig and sound/soc/pxa/Kconfig.

Fix this by ensuring that SND_PXA2XX_SOC correctly triggers the correct
pxa2xx-ac97 compilation.
