clk: h8300: Use standard Linux I/O accessors

There doesn't seem to be any reason why we can't use the standard
readb()/writeb() accessors here because ctrl_inb() and
ctrl_outb() match the generic implementation of readb() and
writeb() that the h8300 architecture uses. This allows us to test
compile this driver on other architectures besides h8300.
