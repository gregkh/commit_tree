mshyperv: fix recognition of Hyper-V guest crash MSR's

Hypervisor Top Level Functional Specification v3.1/4.0 notes that cpuid
(0x40000003) EDX's 10th bit should be used to check that Hyper-V guest
crash MSR's functionality available.

This patch should fix this recognition. Currently the code checks EAX
register instead of EDX.
