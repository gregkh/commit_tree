overflow-arith: begin to add support for overflow builtin functions

The idea of the overflow-arith.h header is to collect overflow checking
functions in one central place.

If gcc compiler supports the __builtin_overflow_* builtins we use them
because they might give better performance, otherwise the code falls
back to normal overflow checking functions.

The builtin_overflow functions are supported by gcc-5 and clang. The
matter of supporting clang is to just provide a corresponding
CC_HAVE_BUILTIN_OVERFLOW, because the specific overflow checking builtins
don't differ between gcc and clang.

I just provide overflow_usub function here as I intend this to get merged
into net, more functions will definitely follow as they are needed.
