netfilter: nfnetlink: work around wrong endianess in res_id field

The convention in nfnetlink is to use network byte order in every header field
as well as in the attribute payload. The initial version of the batching
infrastructure assumes that res_id comes in host byte order though.

The only client of the batching infrastructure is nf_tables, so let's add a
workaround to address this inconsistency. We currently have 11 nfnetlink
subsystems according to NFNL_SUBSYS_COUNT, so we can assume that the subsystem
2560, ie. htons(10), will not be allocated anytime soon, so it can be an alias
of nf_tables from the nfnetlink batching path when interpreting the res_id
field.

Based on original patch from Florian Westphal.
