drm/vmwgfx: Replace SurfaceDMA usage with SurfaceCopy in 2D VMs

This patch address the following underlying issues with SurfaceDMA

* SurfaceDMA command does not work in a 2D VM, but we can wrap a
  proxy surface around the same DMA buffer and use the SurfaceCopy
  command which does work in a 2D VM.

* Wrapping a DMA buffer with a proxy surface also gives us an
  added optimization path for the case when the DMA buf
  dimensions match the mode.  In this case, the DMA buf can
  be pinned as the display surface, saving an extra copy.
  This only works in a 2D VM because we won't be doing any
  rendering operations directly to the display surface.

v2
* Moved is_dmabuf_proxy field to vmw_framebuffer_surface
* Undone coding style changes
* Addressed other issues from review
