ARM: entry: efficiency cleanups

Make the "fast" syscall return path fast again.  The addition of IRQ
tracing and context tracking has made this path grossly inefficient.
We can do much better if these options are enabled if we save the
syscall return code on the stack - we then don't need to save a bunch
of registers around every single callout to C code.
