target/iscsi: Keep local_ip as the actual sockaddr

This is a more natural format that lets us format it with the appropriate
printk specifier as needed.

This also lets us handle v4-mapped ipv6 addresses a little more nicely, by
storing the addr as an actual v4 sockaddr in conn->local_sockaddr.

Finally, we no longer need to maintain variables for port, since this is
contained in sockaddr. Remove iscsi_np.np_port and iscsi_conn.local_port.
