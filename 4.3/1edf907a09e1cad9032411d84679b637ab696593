MIPS: cevt-bcm1480: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate cevt-bcm1480 driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

Read operation on R_SCD_TIMER_CFG and R_SCD_TIMER_INIT registers isn't
performed now for many modes as there returned values aren't used.
