IB/core: Guarantee that a local_dma_lkey is available

Every single ULP requires a local_dma_lkey to do anything with
a QP, so let us ensure one exists for every PD created.

If the driver can supply a global local_dma_lkey then use that, otherwise
ask the driver to create a local use all physical memory MR associated
with the new PD.
