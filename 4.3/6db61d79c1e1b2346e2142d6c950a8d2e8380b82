flow_dissector: Ignore flow dissector return value from ___skb_get_hash

In ___skb_get_hash ignore return value from skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys.
A failure in that function likely means that there was a parse error,
so we may as well use whatever fields were found before the error was
hit.  This is also good because it means we won't keep trying to derive
the hash on subsequent calls to skb_get_hash for the same packet.
