jump_label: Rename JUMP_LABEL_{EN,DIS}ABLE to JUMP_LABEL_{JMP,NOP}

Since we've already stepped away from ENABLE is a JMP and DISABLE is a
NOP with the branch_default bits, and are going to make it even worse,
rename it to make it all clearer.

This way we don't mix multiple levels of logic attributes, but have a
plain 'physical' name for what the current instruction patching status
of a jump label is.

This is a first step in removing the naming confusion that has led to
a stream of avoidable bugs such as:
