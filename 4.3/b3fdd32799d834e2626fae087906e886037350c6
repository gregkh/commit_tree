i2c: mux: Add register-based mux i2c-mux-reg

Based on i2c-mux-gpio driver, similarly the register-based mux
switch from one bus to another by setting a single register.
The register can be on PCIe bus, local bus, or any memory-mapped
address. The endianness of such register can be specified in device
tree if used, or in platform data.
