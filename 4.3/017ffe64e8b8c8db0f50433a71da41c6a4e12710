PCI: Hold pci_slot_mutex while searching bus->slots list

Previously, pci_setup_device() and similar functions searched the
pci_bus->slots list without any locking.  It was possible for another
thread to update the list while we searched it.

Add pci_dev_assign_slot() to search the list while holding pci_slot_mutex.
