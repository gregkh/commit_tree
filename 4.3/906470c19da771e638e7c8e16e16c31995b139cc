net: warn if drivers set tx_queue_len = 0

Due to the introduction of IFF_NO_QUEUE, there is a better way for
drivers to indicate that no qdisc should be attached by default. Though,
the old convention can't be dropped since ignoring that setting would
break drivers still using it. Instead, add a warning so out-of-tree
driver maintainers get a chance to adjust their code before we finally
get rid of any special handling of tx_queue_len == 0.
