watchdog: iTCO: Fix dependencies on I2C

If I2C is built as module, the iTCO watchdog driver must be built as module
as well. I2C_I801 must only be selected if I2C is configured.

This fixes the following build errors, seen if I2C=m and ITCO_WDT=y.

i2c-i801.c:(.text+0x2bf055): undefined reference to `i2c_del_adapter'
i2c-i801.c:(.text+0x2c13e0): undefined reference to `i2c_add_adapter'
i2c-i801.c:(.text+0x2c17bd): undefined reference to `i2c_new_device'
