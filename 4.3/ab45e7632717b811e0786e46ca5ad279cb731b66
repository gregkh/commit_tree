libnvdimm, btt: consolidate arena validation

Use arena_is_valid as a common routine for checking the validity of an
info block from both discover_arenas, and nd_btt_probe.

As a result, don't check for validity of the BTT's UUID, and lbasize.
The checksum in the BTT info block guarantees self-consistency, and when
we're called from nd_btt_probe, we don't have a valid uuid or lbasize
available to check against.

Also cleanup to return a bool instead of an int.
