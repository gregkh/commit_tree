cpufreq: Allow drivers to enable boost support after registering driver

In some cases it wouldn't be known at time of driver registration, if
the driver needs to support boost frequencies.

For example, while getting boost information from DT with opp-v2
bindings, we need to parse the bindings for all the CPUs to know if
turbo/boost OPPs are supported or not.

One way out to do that efficiently is to delay supporting boost mode
(i.e. creating /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost file), until the
time OPP bindings are parsed.

At that point, the driver can enable boost support. This can be done at
->init(), where the frequency table is created.

To do that, the driver requires few APIs from cpufreq core that let him
do this. This patch provides these APIs.
