net: sched: simplify attach_one_default_qdisc()

Now that noqueue qdisc can be attached just like any other qdisc, no
special treatment is necessary anymore when attaching it as default
qdisc.

This change has the added benefit that 'tc qdisc show' prints noqueue
instead of nothing for devices defaulting to noqueue.
