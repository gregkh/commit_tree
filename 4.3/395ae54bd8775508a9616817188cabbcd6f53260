ALSA: usb: handle descriptor with SYNC_NONE illegal value

The M-Audio Transit exposes an interface with a SYNC_NONE attribute.
This is not a valid value according to the USB audio classspec. However
there is a sync endpoint associated to this record. Changing the logic to
try to use this sync endpoint allows for seamless transitions between
altset 2 and altset 3. If any errors happen, the behavior remains the same.
