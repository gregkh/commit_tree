dmaengine: ioatdma: fixup ioatdma_device namings

Changing the variable names for ioatdma_device to be consistently named
ioat_dma instead of device/dma in order to avoid confusion and distinct
from struct device. This will clearly indicate that it is an
ioatdma_device. This also make all the naming consistent that the dma
device is ioat_dma and all the channels are ioat_chan.
