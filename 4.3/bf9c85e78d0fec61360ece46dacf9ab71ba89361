usb: chipidea: introduce ci_platform_configure

It is used to configure controller parameters according to
platform data, like speed, stream mode, etc, both host and
device's initialization need it, most of code are the
same for both roles, with this new interface, it can reduce
the duplicated code and be easy to maintain in future.
