word-at-a-time.h: fix some Kbuild files

arch/tile added word-at-a-time.h after the patch that added generic-y
entries; the generic-y entry is now stale.

arch/h8300 is newer than the generic-y patch for word-at-a-time.h,
and needs a generic-y entry.

arch/powerpc seems to have gotten a generic-y entry by mistake in
the first patch; this change removes it.
