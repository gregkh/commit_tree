bridge: mdb: add vlan support for user entries

Until now all user mdb entries were added in vlan 0, this patch adds
support to allow the user to specify the vlan for the entry.
About the uapi change a hole in struct br_mdb_entry is used so the size
and offsets are kept the same (verified with pahole and tested with older
iproute2).

Example:
$ bridge mdb
dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent vlan 2000
dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent vlan 200
dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
