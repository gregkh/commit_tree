revert "mm: make sure all file VMAs have ->vm_ops set"

Revert commit 6dc296e7df4c "mm: make sure all file VMAs have ->vm_ops
set".

Will Deacon reports that it "causes some mmap regressions in LTP, which
appears to use a MAP_PRIVATE mmap of /dev/zero as a way to get anonymous
pages in some of its tests (specifically mmap10 [1])".

William Shuman reports Oracle crashes.

So revert the patch while we work out what to do.
