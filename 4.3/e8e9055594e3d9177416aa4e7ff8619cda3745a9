[media] pci/Kconfig: don't use MEDIA_ANALOG_TV_SUPPORT for grabber cards

I noticed certain cards are currently under MEDIA_ANALOG_TV_SUPPORT
but it seems they are frame grabbers (with CVBS, Svideo etc. inputs)
rather than TV receivers (with analog TV tuners).

MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT maybe isn't the best name (only "meye" driver seems
to drive a real camera in a laptop) but it at least doesn't select the
TUNERs.

Perhaps the following patch would make sense.
