iio: dht11: Use new function ktime_get_resolution_ns()

This cleans up the most ugly workaround in this driver. There are no
functional changes yet in the decoding algorithm, but we improve the
following things:
 * Get rid of spurious warning messages on systems with fast HRTIMER.
 * If the clock is not fast enough for decoding to work, we give
   up immediately.
 * In that case we return EAGAIN instead of EIO, so it's easier to
   discriminate causes of failure.

Returning EAGAIN is somewhat controversial: It's technically correct
as a faster clock might become available. OTOH once all clocks are
enabled this is a permanent error. There is no ECLOCKTOOSLOW error
code.
