drm/i915: Update a bunch of LRC functions to take requests

A bunch of the low level LRC functions were passing around ringbuf and ctx
pairs. In a few cases, they took the r/c pair and a request as well. This is all
quite messy and unnecesary. The context_queue() call is especially bad since the
fake request code got removed - it takes a request and three extra things that
must be extracted from the request and then it checks them against what it finds
in the request. Removing all the derivable data makes the code much simpler all
round.

This patch updates those functions to just take the request structure.

Note that logical_ring_wait_for_space now takes a request structure but already
had a local request pointer that it uses to scan for something to wait on. To
avoid confusion the local variable has been renamed 'target' (it is searching
for a target request to do something with) and the parameter has been called req
(to guarantee anything accidentally missed gets a compiler error).

v2: Updated commit message re wait_for_space (Tomas Elf review comment).
