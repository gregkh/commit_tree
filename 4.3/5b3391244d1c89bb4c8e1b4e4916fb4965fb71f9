f2fs: warm up cold page after mmaped write

With cost-benifit method, background gc will consider old section with
fewer valid blocks as candidate victim, these old blocks in section will
be treated as cold data, and laterly will be moved into cold segment.

But if the gcing page is attached by user through buffered or mmaped
write, we should reset the page as non-cold one, because this page may
have more opportunity for further updating.

So fix to add clearing code for the missed 'mmap' case.
