cpufreq: Rework two functions related to CPU offline

Since __cpufreq_remove_dev_prepare() and __cpufreq_remove_dev_finish()
are about CPU offline rather than about CPU removal, rename them to
cpufreq_offline_prepare() and cpufreq_offline_finish(), respectively.

Also change their argument from a struct device pointer to a CPU
number, because they use the CPU number only internally anyway
and make them void as their return values are ignored.
