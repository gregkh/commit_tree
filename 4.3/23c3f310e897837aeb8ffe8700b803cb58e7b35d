regulator: core: Correct return value check in regulator_resolve_supply

The ret pointer passed to regulator_dev_lookup is only filled with a
valid error code if regulator_dev_lookup returned NULL. Currently
regulator_resolve_supply checks this ret value before it checks if a
regulator was returned, this can result in valid regulator lookups being
ignored.
