ARM: dts: ventana: add UHS-I support for Ventana boards

UHS-I support is available on Ventana boards with micro-SD sockets depending
on the board revision. To support this pinctl states for 100Mhz and 200MHz
must be added as well as pinmux of the VSELECT signal. In order to support
UHS-I the I/O rail of the 4-bit data bus must be switchable between 1.8V
and 3.3V.

By adding the no-1-8-v property, which disables UHS-I support, we allow the
bootloader to be in charge of selecting which boards have this capability
by removing that property if the board model/revision implement the support.

Additionally we will remove NANDF_CS1 here from the nand pinmux group as the
second chip-select is not used on any ventana boards and this is the pad
that is used for SD3_VELECT.
