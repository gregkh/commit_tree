rbd: set max_sectors explicitly

Commit 30e2bc08b2bb ("Revert "block: remove artifical max_hw_sectors
cap"") restored a clamp on max_sectors.  It's now 2560 sectors instead
of 1024, but it's not good enough: we set max_hw_sectors to rbd object
size because we don't want object sized I/Os to be split, and the
default object size is 4M.

So, set max_sectors to max_hw_sectors in rbd at queue init time.
