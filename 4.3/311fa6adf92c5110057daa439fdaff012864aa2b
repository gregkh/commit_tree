PM / Domains: Return -EPROBE_DEFER if we fail to init or turn-on domain

When a device is probed, the function dev_pm_domain_attach() is called
to see if there is a power-domain that is associated with the device and
needs to be turned on. If dev_pm_domain_attach() does not return
-EPROBE_DEFER then the device will be probed.

For devices using genpd, dev_pm_domain_attach() will call
genpd_dev_pm_attach(). If genpd_dev_pm_attach() does not find a power
domain associated with the device then it returns an error code not
equal to -EPROBE_DEFER to allow the device to be probed. However, if
genpd_dev_pm_attach() does find a power-domain that is associated with
the device, then it does not return -EPROBE_DEFER on failure and hence
the device will still be probed. Furthermore, genpd_dev_pm_attach() does
not check the error code returned by pm_genpd_poweron() to see if the
power-domain was turned on successfully.

Fix this by checking the return code from pm_genpd_poweron() and
returning -EPROBE_DEFER from genpd_dev_pm_attach on failure, if there
is a power-domain associated with the device.
