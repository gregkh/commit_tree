[media] v4l: omap3isp: Fix sub-device power management code

Commit 813f5c0ac5cc ("media: Change media device link_notify behaviour")
modified the media controller link setup notification API and updated the
OMAP3 ISP driver accordingly. As a side effect it introduced a bug by
turning power on after setting the link instead of before. This results in
sub-devices not being powered down in some cases when they should be. Fix
it.
