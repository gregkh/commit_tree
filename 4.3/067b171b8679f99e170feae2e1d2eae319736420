IB/cm: Share listening CM IDs

Enabling network namespaces for RDMA CM will allow processes on different
namespaces to listen on the same port. In order to leave namespace support
out of the CM layer, this requires that multiple RDMA CM IDs will be able
to share a single CM ID.

This patch adds infrastructure to retrieve an existing listening ib_cm_id,
based on its device and service ID, or create a new one if one does not
already exist. It also adds a reference count for such instances
(cm_id_private.listen_sharecount), and prevents cm_destroy_id from
destroying a CM if it is still shared. See the relevant discussion [1].
