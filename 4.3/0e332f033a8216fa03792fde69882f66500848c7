perf tools: Add support for cycles, weight branch_info field

cycles is a new branch_info field available on some CPUs that indicates
the time deltas between branches in the LBR.

Add a sort key and output code for the cycles to allow to display the
basic block cycles individually in perf report.

We also pass in the cycles for weight when LBRs are processed, which
allows to get global and local weight, to get an estimate of the total
cost.

And also print the cycles information for perf report -D.  I also added
printing for the previously missing LBR flags (mispredict etc.)
