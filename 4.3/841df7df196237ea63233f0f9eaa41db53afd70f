jbd2: avoid infinite loop when destroying aborted journal

Commit 6f6a6fda2945 "jbd2: fix ocfs2 corrupt when updating journal
superblock fails" changed jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail() to return EIO
when the journal is aborted. That makes logic in
jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() bail out which is fine, except that
jbd2_journal_destroy() expects jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() to always make
a progress in cleaning the journal. Without it jbd2_journal_destroy()
just loops in an infinite loop.

Fix jbd2_journal_destroy() to cleanup journal checkpoint lists of
jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() fails with error.
