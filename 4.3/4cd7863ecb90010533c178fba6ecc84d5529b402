irqchip/renesas-irqc: Propagate wake-up settings to parent

The renesas-irqc interrupt controller is cascaded to the GIC, but its
driver doesn't propagate wake-up settings to the parent interrupt
controller.

Since commit aec89ef72ba6c944 ("irqchip/gic: Enable SKIP_SET_WAKE and
MASK_ON_SUSPEND"), the GIC driver masks interrupts during suspend, and
wake-up through gpio-keys now fails on r8a73a4/ape6evm.

Fix this by propagating wake-up settings to the parent interrupt
controller. There's no need to handle irq_set_irq_wake() failures, as
the renesas-irqc interrupt controller is always cascaded to a GIC, and
the GIC driver always sets SKIP_SET_WAKE since the aforementioned
commit.
