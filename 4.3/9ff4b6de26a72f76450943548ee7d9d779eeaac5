rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Remove and replace routine in hw.c and mac.c

I remove duplicated routines which related rtl92cu_set_hw_reg().

1. rtl92c_set_qos() and HW_VAR_AC_PARAM routine are similar code.
so i replace code with rtlpriv->cfg->ops->set_hw_reg().

2. rtl92c_set_mac_addr() and 'HW_VAR_ETHER_ADDR' case at
rtl92cu_set_hw_reg() routine are similar code.
so i removed rtl92c_set_mac_addr() function.
also it was not used anywhere.

3. remove HW_VAR_ACM_CTRL routine in rtl92cu_set_hw_reg().
if rtl_usb->acm_method is not EACMWAY2_SW, HW_VAR_ACM_CTRL is called
from HW_VAR_AC_PARAM. but it never called. because acm_method is always
EACMWAY2_SW. so i remove acm_method check routine
and HW_VAR_ACM_CTRL routine.

both usb and pci interface is not used HW_VAR_ACM_CTRL.
but i can't test pci interface module, so i didn't modify pci code.
