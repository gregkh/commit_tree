[media] Add helper function for subdev event notifications

Add a new helper function called v4l2_subdev_notify_event() which will
deliver the specified event to both the v4l2 subdev event queue as well as
to the notify callback. The former is typically used by userspace
applications to listen to notification events while the later is used by
bridge drivers. Combining both into the same function avoids boilerplate
code in subdev drivers.
