arm64/BUG: Show explicit backtrace for WARNs

The generic slowpath WARN implementation prints a backtrace, but
the report_bug() based implementation does not, opting to print the
registers instead which is generally not as useful.

Ideally, report_bug() should be fixed to make the behaviour more
consistent, but in the meantime this patch generates a backtrace
directly from the arm64 backend instead so that this functionality
is not lost with the migration to report_bug().

As a side-effect, the backtrace will be outside the oops end
marker, but that's hard to avoid without modifying generic code.

This patch can go away if report_bug() grows the ability in the
future to generate a backtrace directly or call an arch hook at the
appropriate time.
