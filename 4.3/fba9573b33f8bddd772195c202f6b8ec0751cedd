cpufreq: Correct a freq check in cpufreq_set_policy()

This check was originally added by commit 9c9a43ed2734 ("[CPUFREQ]
return error when failing to set minfreq").It attempt to return an error
on obviously incorrect limits when we echo xxx >.../scaling_max,min_freq
Actually we just need check if new_policy->min > new_policy->max.
Because at least one of max/min is copied from cpufreq_get_policy().

For example, when we echo xxx > .../scaling_min_freq, new_policy is
copied from policy in cpufreq_get_policy. new_policy->max is same with
policy->max. new_policy->min is set to a new value.

Let me explain it in deduction method, first statement in if ():
new_policy->min > policy->max
policy->max == new_policy->max
==> new_policy->min > new_policy->max

second statement in if():
new_policy->max < policy->min
policy->max < policy->min
==>new_policy->min > new_policy->max (induction method)

So we have proved that we only need check if new_policy->min >
new_policy->max.

After apply this patch, we can also modify ->min and ->max at same time
if new freq range is very much different from current freq range. For
example, if current freq range is 480000-960000, then we want to set
this range to 1120000-2240000, we would fail in the past because
new_policy->min > policy->max. As long as the cpufreq range is valid, we
has no reason to reject the user. So correct the check to avoid such
case.
