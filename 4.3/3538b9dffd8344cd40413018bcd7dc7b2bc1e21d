drm/i915: Use atomic state for calculating DVO_2X_MODE on i830.

This is a small behavioral change because it leaves DVO_2X_MODE
set between crtc_disable and crtc_enable. This is probably harmless
though and if not should be fixed by calculating 2x mode before
enable/disable pll.

This is needed because intel_crtc->active will be removed eventually.
