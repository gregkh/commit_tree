drm/i915/skl: WaIgnoreDDIAStrap is forever, always init DDI A

There is currently conflicting documentation on which steppings the
workaround is needed, up to C vs. forever. However there is post-C
stepping hardware that doesn't report port presence on DDI A, leading to
black screen on eDP. Assume the strap isn't connected, and try to enable
DDI A on these machines. (We'll still check the VBT for the info in DDI
init.)
