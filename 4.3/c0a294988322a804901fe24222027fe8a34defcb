mm/memblock: WARN_ON when nid differs from overlap region

Each memblock_region has nid to indicates the Node ID of this range.  For
the overlap case, memblock_add_range() inserts the lower part and leave
the upper part as indicated in the overlapped region.

If the nid of the new range differs from the overlapped region, the
information recorded is not correct.

This patch adds a WARN_ON when the nid of the new range differs from the
overlapped region.
