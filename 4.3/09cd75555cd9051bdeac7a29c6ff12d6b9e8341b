kconfig: Regenerate shipped zconf.{hash,lex}.c files

Update the shipped files generated by flex and gperf to support the
explicit use of "---help---" and to emit warnings for unsupported
characters on COMMAND tokens.

As I could not find out which flex/gperf version was used to generate
the previous version, I used flex 2.5.35  and gperf 3.0.4 from
Ubuntu 14.04 - this also leads to the big number of changed lines
in this patch.
