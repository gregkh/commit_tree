uprobes: Use vm_special_mapping to name the XOL vma

Change xol_add_vma() to use _install_special_mapping(), this way
we can name the vma installed by uprobes. Currently it looks
like private anonymous mapping, this is confusing and
complicates the debugging. With this change /proc/$pid/maps
reports "[uprobes]".

As a side effect this will cause core dumps to include the XOL vma
and I think this is good; this can help to debug the problem if
the app crashed because it was probed.
