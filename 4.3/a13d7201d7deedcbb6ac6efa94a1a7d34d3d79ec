xen/privcmd: Further s/MFN/GFN/ clean-up

The privcmd code is mixing the usage of GFN and MFN within the same
functions which make the code difficult to understand when you only work
with auto-translated guests.

The privcmd driver is only dealing with GFN so replace all the mention
of MFN into GFN.

The ioctl structure used to map foreign change has been left unchanged
given that the userspace is using it. Nonetheless, add a comment to
explain the expected value within the "mfn" field.
