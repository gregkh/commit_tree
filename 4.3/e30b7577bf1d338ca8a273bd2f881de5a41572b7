rbd: use writefull op for object size writes

This covers only the simplest case - an object size sized write, but
it's still useful in tiering setups when EC is used for the base tier
as writefull op can be proxied, saving an object promotion.

Even though updating ceph_osdc_new_request() to allow writefull should
just be a matter of fixing an assert, I didn't do it because its only
user is cephfs.  All other sites were updated.

Reflects ceph.git commit 7bfb7f9025a8ee0d2305f49bf0336d2424da5b5b.
