dax: move DAX-related functions to a new header

In order to handle the !CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGES case, we need to
return VM_FAULT_FALLBACK from the inlined dax_pmd_fault(), which is
defined in linux/mm.h.  Given that we don't want to include <linux/mm.h>
in <linux/fs.h>, the easiest solution is to move the DAX-related
functions to a new header, <linux/dax.h>.  We could also have moved
VM_FAULT_* definitions to a new header, or a different header that isn't
quite such a boil-the-ocean header as <linux/mm.h>, but this felt like
the best option.
