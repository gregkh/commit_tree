perf probe: Use existing routine to look for a kernel module by dso->short_name

We have map_groups__find_by_name() to look at the list of modules that
are in place for a given machine, so use it instead of traversing the
machine dso list, which also includes DSOs for userspace.

When merging the user and kernel DSO lists a bug was introduced where
'perf probe' stopped being able to add probes to modules using its short
name:

  # perf probe -m usbnet --add usbnet_start_xmit
  usbnet_start_xmit is out of .text, skip it.
    Error: Failed to add events.
  #

With this fix it works again:

  # perf probe -m usbnet --add usbnet_start_xmit
  Added new event:
    probe:usbnet_start_xmit (on usbnet_start_xmit in usbnet)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe:usbnet_start_xmit -aR sleep 1
