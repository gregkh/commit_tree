drm/amdgpu: Keep the pflip interrupts always enabled v7

interrupts.

v3: Re-enable pflip interrupt wherever we re-enable a CRTC
v4: Enable pflip interrupt in DAL as well
v5: drop DAL changes for upstream
v6: (agd): only enable interrupts on crtcs that exist
v7: (agd): integrate suggestions from Michel
