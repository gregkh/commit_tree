drm/i915: Update WaFlushCoherentL3CacheLinesAtContextSwitch

In this WA we need to set GEN8_L3SQCREG4[21:21] and reset it after PIPE_CONTROL
instruction but there is a slight complication as this is applied in WA batch
where the values are only initialized once.
Dave identified an issue with the current implementation where the register value
is read once at the beginning and it is reused; this patch corrects this by saving
the register value to memory, update register with the bit of our interest and
restore it back with original value.

This implementation uses MI_LOAD_REGISTER_MEM which is currently only used
by command parser and was using a default length of 0. This is now updated
with correct length and moved to appropriate place.
