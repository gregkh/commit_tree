tcp: refine pacing rate determination

When TCP pacing was added back in linux-3.12, we chose
to apply a fixed ratio of 200 % against current rate,
to allow probing for optimal throughput even during
slow start phase, where cwnd can be doubled every other gRTT.

At Google, we found it was better applying a different ratio
while in Congestion Avoidance phase.
This ratio was set to 120 %.

We've used the normal tcp_in_slow_start() helper for a while,
then tuned the condition to select the conservative ratio
as soon as cwnd >= ssthresh/2 :

- After cwnd reduction, it is safer to ramp up more slowly,
  as we approach optimal cwnd.
- Initial ramp up (ssthresh == INFINITY) still allows doubling
  cwnd every other RTT.
