drm/atomic: Update legacy DPMS state during modesets, v3.

This is required for DPMS to work correctly, during a modeset
the DPMS property should be turned off, unless the state is
crtc is made active in which case it should be set to DPMS on.

Changes since v1:
- Set DPMS to off when a connector is removed from a crtc too.
- Update the legacy dpms property too.
- Add an exception for the legacy dpms paths, it updates its own state.
Changes since v2:
- Do not preserve dpms property.
