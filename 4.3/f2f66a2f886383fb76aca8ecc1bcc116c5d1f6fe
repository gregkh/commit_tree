btrfs: Check cancel and pause in interval of scrub operation

Old code checking cancel and pause request inside scrub stripe
operation, like:
  loop() {
    if (parity) {
      scrub_parity_stripe();
      continue;
    }

    check_cancel_and_pause()

    scrub_normal_stripe();
  }

Reason is when introduce raid56 stripe scrub, new code is inserted
simplely to front of loop.

Better to:
  loop() {
    check_cancel_and_pause()

    if (parity)
      scrub_parity_stripe();
    else
      scrub_normal_stripe();
  }

This patch adjusted code place to realize above sequence.
