Btrfs: count devices correctly in readahead during RAID 5/6 replace

Commit 5fbc7c59fd22 ("Btrfs: fix unfinished readahead thread for raid5/6
degraded mounting") fixed a problem where we would skip a missing device
when we shouldn't have because there are no other mirrors to read from
in RAID 5/6. After commit 2c8cdd6ee4e7 ("Btrfs, replace: write dirty
pages into the replace target device"), the fix doesn't work when we're
doing a missing device replace on RAID 5/6 because the replace device is
counted as a mirror so we're tricked into thinking we can safely skip
the missing device. The fix is to count only the real stripes and decide
based on that.
