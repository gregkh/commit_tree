spi: Fix per-page mapping of unaligned vmalloc-ed buffer

spi_map_buf() processes mapping of vmalloc-ed buffers in a special way,
making mapping of every page separately. However, if the buffer is not
aligned to page boundary (e.g. sub-array in a vmalloc-ed array), it
fills the scatter table with page-size unaligned pieces, that cross
page boundaries. This is incorrect and can, for example, cause memory
corruption and various crashes when working with ubifs on spi-nor chips
(though those drivers are themselves buggy in that they should be
providing DMAable memory to the SPI framework).

Fix this by using proper scatter table size and intra-page buffer lengths,
so that the whole buffer splits into separate scatter table entries on
page boundaries.
