PM / OPP: Add support to parse "operating-points-v2" bindings

This adds support in OPP library to parse and create list of OPPs from
operating-points-v2 bindings. It takes care of most of the properties of
new bindings (except shared-opp, which will be handled separately).

For backward compatibility, we keep supporting earlier bindings. We try
to search for the new bindings first, in case they aren't present we
look for the old deprecated ones.

There are few things marked as TODO:
- Support for multiple OPP tables
- Support for multiple regulators

They should be fixed separately.
