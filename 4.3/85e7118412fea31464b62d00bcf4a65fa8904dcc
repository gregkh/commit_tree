ASoC: wm8983: Get rid of wm8983_access_masks table

The max8983_access table is used for look up readable/writable
attributes of registers. The writable registers are mostly in continuous
ranges, so we can replace max8983_access table by using case range.
The read fields are all 0, so just drop implement of .readable callback.

Also set .max_register setting.
