x86/smpboot: Fix CPU #1 boot timeout

The following commit:

  a9bcaa02a5104ac ("x86/smpboot: Remove SIPI delays from cpu_up()")

Caused some Intel Core2 processors to time-out when bringing up CPU #1,
resulting in the missing of that CPU after bootup.

That patch reduced the SIPI delays from udelay() 300, 200 to udelay() 0,
0 on modern processors.

Several Intel(R) Core(TM)2 systems failed to bring up CPU #1 10/10 times
after that change.

Increasing either of the SIPI delays to udelay(1) results in
success. So here we increase both to udelay(10).  While this may
be 20x slower than the absolute minimum, it is still 20x to 30x
faster than the original code.
