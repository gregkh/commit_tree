drm/i915: Add *_ring_begin() to request allocation

Now that the *_ring_begin() functions no longer call the request allocation
code, it is finally safe for the request allocation code to call *_ring_begin().
This is important to guarantee that the space reserved for the subsequent
i915_add_request() call does actually get reserved.

v2: Renamed functions according to review feedback (Tomas Elf).
