PCI: Use function 0 VPD for identical functions, regular VPD for others

932c435caba8 ("PCI: Add dev_flags bit to access VPD through function 0")
added PCI_DEV_FLAGS_VPD_REF_F0.  Previously, we set the flag on every
non-zero function of quirked devices.  If a function turned out to be
different from function 0, i.e., it had a different class, vendor ID, or
device ID, the flag remained set but we didn't make VPD accessible at all.

Flip this around so we only set PCI_DEV_FLAGS_VPD_REF_F0 for functions that
are identical to function 0, and allow regular VPD access for any other
functions.
