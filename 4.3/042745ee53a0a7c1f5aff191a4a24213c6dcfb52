dm raid: fix round up of default region size

Commit 3a0f9aaee028 ("dm raid: round region_size to power of two")
intended to make sure that the default region size is a power of two.
However, the logic in that commit is incorrect and sets the variable
region_size to 0 or 1, depending on whether min_region_size is a power
of two.

Fix this logic, using roundup_pow_of_two(), so that region_size is
properly rounded up to the next power of two.
