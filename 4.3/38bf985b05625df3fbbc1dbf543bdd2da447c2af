timer_list: Add the base offset so remaining nsecs are accurate for non monotonic timers

I noticed for non-monotonic timers in timer_list, some of the
output looked a little confusing.

For example:
 #1: <0000000000000000>, posix_timer_fn, S:01, hrtimer_start_range_ns, leap-a-day/2360
 # expires at 1434412800000000000-1434412800000000000 nsecs [in 1434410725062375469 to 1434410725062375469 nsecs]

You'll note the relative time till the expiration "[in xxx to
yyy nsecs]" is incorrect. This is because its printing the delta
between CLOCK_MONOTONIC time to the CLOCK_REALTIME expiration.

This patch fixes this issue by adding the clock offset to the
"now" time which we use to calculate the delta.
