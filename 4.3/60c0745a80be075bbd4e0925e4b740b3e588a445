ARM: shmobile: r8a7794 dtsi: Add CPG/MSTP Clock Domain

Add an appropriate "#power-domain-cells" property to the cpg_clocks
device node, to create the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain.

Add "power-domains" properties to all device nodes for devices that are
part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be power-managed through an
MSTP clock.  This applies to most on-SoC devices, which have a
one-to-one mapping from SoC device to DT device node.
