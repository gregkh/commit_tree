iio: st_accel: fix interrupt handling on LIS3LV02

This accelerometer accidentally either emits a DRDY signal or an
IRQ signal. Accidentally I activated the IRQ signal as I thought
it was analogous to the interrupt generator on other ST
accelerometers. This was wrong. After this patch generic_buffer
gives a nice stream of accelerometer readings.
