Btrfs: fix defrag to merge tail file extent

The file layout is

[extent 1]...[extent n][4k extent][HOLE][extent x]

extent 1~n and 4k extent can be merged during defrag, and the whole
defrag bytes is larger than our defrag thresh(256k), 4k extent as a
tail is left unmerged since we check if its next extent can be merged
(the next one is a hole, so the check will fail), the layout thus can
be

[new extent][4k extent][HOLE][extent x]
 (1~n)

To fix it, beside looking at the next one, this also looks at the
previous one by checking @defrag_end, which is set to 0 when we
decide to stop merging contiguous extents, otherwise, we can merge
the previous one with our extent.

Also, this makes btrfs behave consistent with how xfs and ext4 do.
