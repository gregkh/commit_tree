NFS: Fix up page writeback accounting

Currently, we are crediting all the calls to nfs_writepages_callback()
(i.e. the nfs_writepages() callback) to nfs_writepage(). Aside from
being inconsistent with the behaviour of the equivalent readpage/readpages
accounting, this also means that we cannot distinguish between bulk writes
and single page writebacks (which confuses the 'nfsiostat -p' tool).
