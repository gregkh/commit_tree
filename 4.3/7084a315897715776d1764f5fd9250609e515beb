netlink: mmap: fix lookup frame position

__netlink_lookup_frame() was always called with the same "pos"
value in netlink_forward_ring(). It will look at the same ring entry
header over and over again, every time through this loop. Then cycle
through the whole ring, advancing ring->head, not "pos" until it
equals the "ring->head != head" loop test fails.
