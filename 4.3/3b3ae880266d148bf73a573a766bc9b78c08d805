net: sched: consolidate tc_classify{,_compat}

For classifiers getting invoked via tc_classify(), we always need an
extra function call into tc_classify_compat(), as both are being
exported as symbols and tc_classify() itself doesn't do much except
handling of reclassifications when tp->classify() returned with
TC_ACT_RECLASSIFY.

CBQ and ATM are the only qdiscs that directly call into tc_classify_compat(),
all others use tc_classify(). When tc actions are being configured
out in the kernel, tc_classify() effectively does nothing besides
delegating.

We could spare this layer and consolidate both functions. pktgen on
single CPU constantly pushing skbs directly into the netif_receive_skb()
path with a dummy classifier on ingress qdisc attached, improves
slightly from 22.3Mpps to 23.1Mpps.
