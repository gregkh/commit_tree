include/linux/poison.h: fix LIST_POISON{1,2} offset

Poison pointer values should be small enough to find a room in
non-mmap'able/hardly-mmap'able space.  E.g.  on x86 "poison pointer space"
is located starting from 0x0.  Given unprivileged users cannot mmap
anything below mmap_min_addr, it should be safe to use poison pointers
lower than mmap_min_addr.

The current poison pointer values of LIST_POISON{1,2} might be too big for
mmap_min_addr values equal or less than 1 MB (common case, e.g.  Ubuntu
uses only 0x10000).  There is little point to use such a big value given
the "poison pointer space" below 1 MB is not yet exhausted.  Changing it
to a smaller value solves the problem for small mmap_min_addr setups.

The values are suggested by Solar Designer:
