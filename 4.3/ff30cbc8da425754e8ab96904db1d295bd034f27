usb: Use the USB_SS_MULT() macro to get the burst multiplier.

Bits 1:0 of the bmAttributes are used for the burst multiplier.
The rest of the bits used to be reserved (zero), but USB3.1 takes bit 7
into use.

Use the existing USB_SS_MULT() macro instead to make sure the mult value
and hence max packet calculations are correct for USB3.1 devices.

Note that burst multiplier in bmAttributes is zero based and that
the USB_SS_MULT() macro adds one.
