i2c: mv64xxx: really allow I2C offloading

Commit 00d8689b85a7 ("i2c: mv64xxx: rework offload support to fix
several problems") completely reworked the offload support, but left a
debugging-related "return false" at the beginning of the
mv64xxx_i2c_can_offload() function. This has the unfortunate consequence
that offloading is in fact never used, which wasn't really the
intention.

This commit fixes that problem by removing the bogus "return false".
