IB/iser: Introduce struct iser_reg_resources

Have fast_reg_descriptor hold struct iser_reg_resources
(mr, frpl, valid flag). This will be useful when the
actual buffer registration routines will be passed with
the needed registration resources (i.e. iser_reg_resources)
without being aware of their nature (i.e. data or protection).

In order to achieve this, we remove reg_indicators flags container
and place specific flags (mr_valid) within iser_reg_resources struct.
We also place the sig_mr_valid and sig_protcted flags in iser_pi_context.

This patch also modifies iser_fast_reg_mr to receive the
reg_resources instead of the fast_reg_descriptor and a data/protection
indicator.
