Documentation: arm: Fix typo in the idle-states bindings examples

The idle-states bindings mandate that the entry-method string
in the idle-states node must be "psci" for ARM v8 64-bit systems,
but the examples in the bindings report a wrong entry-method string.
Owing to this typo, some dts in the kernel wrongly defined the
entry-method property, since they likely cut and pasted the example
definition without paying attention to the bindings definitions.

This patch fixes the typo in the DT idle states bindings examples and
respective dts in the kernel so that the bindings and related dts
files are made compliant.
