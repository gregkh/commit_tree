IB/srp: Create an insecure all physical rkey only if needed

The SRP initiator only needs this if the insecure register_always=N
performance optimization is enabled, or if FRWR/FMR is not supported
in the driver.

Do not create an all physical MR unless it is needed to support
either of those modes. Default register_always to true so the out of
the box configuration does not create an insecure all physical MR.
