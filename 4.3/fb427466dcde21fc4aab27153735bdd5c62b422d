i2c: designware: Make debug print in i2c_dw_isr() shorter

Printing adapter name is irrelevant from this debug print and makes output
needlessly long. Having already device and functions names printed here is
enough for debugging.

While at it remove extra space from "enabled= 0x" and use "%#x" for
printing "0x" prefixed hexadecimal values.
