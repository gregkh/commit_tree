nvmem: Add nvmem_device based consumer apis.

This patch adds read/write apis which are based on nvmem_device. It is
common that the drivers like omap cape manager or qcom cpr driver to
access bytes directly at particular offset in the eeprom and not from
nvmem cell info in DT. These driver would need to get access to the nvmem
directly, which is what these new APIS provide.

These wrapper apis would help such users to avoid code duplication in
there drivers and also avoid them reading a big eeprom blob and parsing
it internally in there driver.
