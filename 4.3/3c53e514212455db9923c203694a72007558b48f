fsnotify: fix check in inotify fdinfo printing

A check in inotify_fdinfo() checking whether mark is valid was always
true due to a bug.  Luckily we can never get to invalidated marks since
we hold mark_mutex and invalidated marks get removed from the group list
when they are invalidated under that mutex.

Anyway fix the check to make code more future proof.
