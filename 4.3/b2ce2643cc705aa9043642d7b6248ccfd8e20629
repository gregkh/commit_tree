blk-throttle: clean up blkg_policy_data alloc/init/exit/free methods

With the recent addition of alloc and free methods, things became
messier.  This patch reorganizes them according to the followings.

* ->pd_alloc_fn()

  Responsible for allocation and static initializations - the ones
  which can be done independent of where the pd might be attached.

* ->pd_init_fn()

  Initializations which require the knowledge of where the pd is
  attached.

* ->pd_free_fn()

  The counter part of pd_alloc_fn().  Static de-init and freeing.

This leaves ->pd_exit_fn() without any users.  Removed.

While at it, collapse an one liner function throtl_pd_exit(), which
has only one user, into its user.
