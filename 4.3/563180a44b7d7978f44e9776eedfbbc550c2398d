cfq-iosched: minor cleanups

* Some were accessing cic->cfqq[] directly.  Always use cic_to_cfqq()
  and cic_set_cfqq().

* check_ioprio_changed() doesn't need to verify cfq_get_queue()'s
  return for NULL.  It's always non-NULL.  Simplify accordingly.

This patch doesn't cause any functional changes.
