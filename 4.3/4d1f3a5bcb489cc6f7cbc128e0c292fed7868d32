cpufreq: Do not update related_cpus on every policy activation

The related_cpus mask includes CPUs whose cpufreq_cpu_data per-CPU
pointers have been set the the given policy.  Since those pointers
are only set at the policy creation time and unset when the policy
is deleted, the related_cpus should not be updated between those
two operations.

For this reason, avoid updating it whenever the first of the
"related" CPUs goes online.
