ARM: dts: fix gpio-keys wakeup-source property

The keyboard driver for GPIO buttons(gpio-keys) checks for one of the
two boolean properties to enable gpio buttons as wakeup source:
1. "wakeup-source" or
2. the legacy "gpio-key,wakeup"

However juno, ste-snowball and emev2-kzm9d dts file have a undetected
"wakeup" property to indictate the wakeup source.

This patch fixes it by making use of "wakeup-source" property.
