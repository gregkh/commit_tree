rtc: class: remove unnecessary device_get() in rtc_device_unregister

Technically the address of rtc->dev can never be NULL, so get_device()
can never fail. Also caller of rtc_device_unregister() supposed to be
the owner of the device and thus have a valid reference. Therefore
call to get_device() is not needed here.
