arm64: Better native ptrace support for compat tasks

The compat ptrace interface allows access to the TLS register, hardware
breakpoints and watchpoints, syscall number. However, a native task
using the native ptrace interface to debug compat tasks (e.g. multi-arch
gdb) only has access to the general and VFP register sets. The compat
ptrace interface cannot be accessed from a native task.

This patch adds a new user_aarch32_ptrace_view which contains the TLS,
hardware breakpoint/watchpoint and syscall number regsets in addition to
the existing GPR and VFP regsets. This view is backwards compatible with
the previous kernels. Core dumping of 32-bit tasks and compat ptrace are
not affected since the original user_aarch32_view is preserved.
