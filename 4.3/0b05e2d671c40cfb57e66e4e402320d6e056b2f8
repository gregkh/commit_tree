powerpc/32: cacheable_memcpy becomes memcpy

cacheable_memcpy uses dcbz instruction and is more efficient than
memcpy when the destination is in RAM. If the destination is in an
io area, memcpy_toio() is normally used, not memcpy

This patch renames memcpy as generic_memcpy, and renames
cacheable_memcpy as memcpy

On MPC885, we get approximatly 7% increase of the transfer rate
on an FTP reception
