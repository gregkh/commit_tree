uprobes: Fix the usage of install_special_mapping()

install_special_mapping(pages) expects that "pages" is the zero-
terminated array while xol_add_vma() passes &area->page, this
means that special_mapping_fault() can wrongly use the next
member in xol_area (vaddr) as "struct page *".

Fortunately, this area is not expandable so pgoff != 0 isn't
possible (modulo bugs in special_mapping_vmops), but still this
does not look good.
