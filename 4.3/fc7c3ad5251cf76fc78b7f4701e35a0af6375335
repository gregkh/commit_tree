brcmfmac: bump highest event number for 4339 firmware

The event mask length is determined by the highest event number
that is specified in the driver. When this length is shorter than
firmware expects setting event mask will fail and device becomes
pretty useless. This issue was reported with bcm4339 firmware that
was recently released.
