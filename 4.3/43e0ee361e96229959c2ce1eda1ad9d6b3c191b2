cpufreq: governor: split out common part of {cs|od}_dbs_timer()

Some part of cs_dbs_timer() and od_dbs_timer() is exactly same and is
unnecessarily duplicated.

Create the real work-handler in cpufreq_governor.c and put the common
code in this routine (dbs_timer()).

Shouldn't make any functional change.
