staging: unisys: visornic: correct visornic_pause

Correct visornic_pause() to indicate completion asynchronously rather
than in-line

Previously, visornic_pause() (called to stop the device due to IOVM service
partition recovery) was calling the passed complete_func() in-line, rather
than delaying the calling until after the device had actually been stopped.

The behavior has been corrected so that the calling of the complete_func()
is now delayed until after the stopping of the device has been completed in
visornic_serverdown_complete(), which runs asynchronously via the workqueue
visornic_serverdown_workqueue.
