md/raid10: submit_bio_wait() returns 0 on success

This was introduced with 9e882242c6193ae6f416f2d8d8db0d9126bd996b
which changed the return value of submit_bio_wait() to return != 0 on
error, but didn't update the caller accordingly.

Fixes: 9e882242c6 ("block: Add submit_bio_wait(), remove from md")
