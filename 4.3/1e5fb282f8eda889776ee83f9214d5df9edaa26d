MIPS: CPS: Stop dangling delay slot from has_mt.

The has_mt macro ended with a branch, leaving its callers with a delay
slot that would be executed if Config3.MT is not set. However it would
not be executed if Config3 (or earlier Config registers) don't exist
which makes it somewhat inconsistent at best. Fill the delay slot in the
macro & fix the mips_cps_boot_vpes caller appropriately.
