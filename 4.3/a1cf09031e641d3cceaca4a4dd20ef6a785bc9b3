dmaengine: at_xdmac: change block increment addressing mode

The addressing mode we were using was not only incrementing the address at
each microblock, but also at each data boundary, which was severely slowing
the transfer, without any benefit since we were not using the data stride.

Switch to the micro block increment only in order to get back to an
acceptable performance level.
