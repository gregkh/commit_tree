cpufreq: remove redundant CPUFREQ_INCOMPATIBLE notifier event

What's being done from CPUFREQ_INCOMPATIBLE, can also be done with
CPUFREQ_ADJUST. There is nothing special with CPUFREQ_INCOMPATIBLE
notifier.

Kill CPUFREQ_INCOMPATIBLE and fix its usage sites.

This also updates the numbering of notifier events to remove holes.
