IB/cm: Fix rb-tree duplicate free and use-after-free

ib_send_cm_sidr_rep could sometimes erase the node from the sidr
(depending on errors in the process). Since ib_send_cm_sidr_rep is
called both from cm_sidr_req_handler and cm_destroy_id, cm_id_priv
could be either erased from the rb_tree twice or not erased at all.
Fixing that by making sure it's erased only once before freeing
cm_id_priv.
