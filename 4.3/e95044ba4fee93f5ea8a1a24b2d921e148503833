tty: serial: imx.c: Reset UART before activating interrupts

If the UART has been in use before this driver was loaded, IRQs might be
active and get fired as soon as we set the handler, which will crash
in the spin_lock_irqsave(&sport->port.lock, flags) because port.lock is
not initialized until the port is added at the end of probe.
