net: thunderx: Support for upto 96 queues for a VF

This patch adds support for handling multiple qsets assigned to a
single VF. There by increasing no of queues from earlier 8 to max
no of CPUs in the system i.e 48 queues on a single node and 96 on
dual node system. User doesn't have option to assign which Qsets/VFs
 to be merged. Upon request from VF, PF assigns next free Qsets as
secondary qsets. To maintain current behavior no of queues is kept
to 8 by default which can be increased via ethtool.

If user wants to unbind NICVF driver from a secondary Qset then it
should be done after tearing down primary VF's interface.
