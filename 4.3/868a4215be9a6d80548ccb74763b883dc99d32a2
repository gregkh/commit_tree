net: phy: fixed_phy: handle link-down case

fixed_phy_register() currently hardcodes the fixed PHY link to 1, and
expects to find a "speed" parameter to provide correct information
towards the fixed PHY consumer.

In a subsequent change, where we allow "managed" (e.g: (RS)GMII in-band
status auto-negotiation) fixed PHYs, none of these parameters can be
provided since they will be auto-negotiated, hence, we just provide a
zero-initialized fixed_phy_status to fixed_phy_register() which makes it
fail when we call fixed_phy_update_regs() since status.speed = 0 which
makes us hit the "default" label and error out.

Without this change, we would also see potentially inconsistent
speed/duplex parameters for fixed PHYs when the link is DOWN.
