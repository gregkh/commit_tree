netlink: add NETLINK_CAP_ACK socket option

Since commit c05cdb1b864f ("netlink: allow large data transfers from
user-space"), the kernel may fail to allocate the necessary room for the
acknowledgment message back to userspace. This patch introduces a new
socket option that trims off the payload of the original netlink message.

The netlink message header is still included, so the user can guess from
the sequence number what is the message that has triggered the
acknowledgment.
