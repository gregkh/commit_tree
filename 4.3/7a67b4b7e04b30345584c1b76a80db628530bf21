KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Relax vgic_can_sample_irq for edge IRQs

We only set the irq_queued flag for level interrupts, meaning
that "!vgic_irq_is_queued(vcpu, irq)" is a good enough predicate
for all interrupts.

This will allow us to inject edge HW interrupts, for which the
state ACTIVE+PENDING is not allowed.
