bootmem: avoid freeing to bootmem after bootmem is done

Bootmem isn't popular any more, but some architectures still use it, and
freeing to bootmem after calling free_all_bootmem_core() can end up
scribbling over random memory.  Instead, make sure the kernel generates
a warning in this case by ensuring the node_bootmem_map field is
non-NULL when are freeing or marking bootmem.

An instance of this bug was just fixed in the tile architecture ("tile:
use free_bootmem_late() for initrd") and catching this case more widely
seems like a good thing.
