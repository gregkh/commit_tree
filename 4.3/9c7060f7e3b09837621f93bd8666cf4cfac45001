drm: Stop filtering according to mode_group in getresources

It's been dead code since forever since mode groups haven't ever been
implemented. On top of that it's also been non-functional since we
only ever filtered the getresources ioctl and not any of the others
nor the mode object lookup code.

Given overwhelming evidence it looks like this isn't a feature we
need, hence remove it.
