ACPICA: Namespace: Add function to directly return normalized full path

ACPICA commit 6e0229bb156d71675f2e07dc7960adb7ec0a60ea

This patch adds functions to return normalized full path instead of
"external path". The external path contains trailing "_" for each
name segment while the normalized full path doesn't contain the
trailing "_".

Currently this function is used by the method tracing users to specify a
none trailing "_" attached name path. Lv Zheng.

Note that we need to validate and switch all Linux kernel acpi_get_name()
users to use the new name type before removing the old name type from
ACPICA.
