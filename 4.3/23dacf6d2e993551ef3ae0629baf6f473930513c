PM / OPP: Break _opp_add_dynamic() into smaller functions

Later commits would add support for new OPP bindings and this would be
required then. So, lets do it in a separate patch to make it easily
reviewable.

Another change worth noticing is INIT_LIST_HEAD(&opp->node). We weren't
doing it earlier as we never tried to delete a list node before it is
added to list. But this wouldn't be the case anymore. We might try to
delete a node (just to reuse the same code paths), without it being
getting added to the list.
