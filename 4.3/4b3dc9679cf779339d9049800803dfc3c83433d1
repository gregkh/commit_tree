arm64: force CONFIG_SMP=y and remove redundant #ifdefs

Nobody seems to be producing !SMP systems anymore, so this is just
becoming a source of kernel bugs, particularly if people want to use
coherent DMA with non-shared pages.

This patch forces CONFIG_SMP=y for arm64, removing a modest amount of
code in the process.
