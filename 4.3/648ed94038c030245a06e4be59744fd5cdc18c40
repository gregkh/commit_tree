x86/mce: Provide a lockless memory pool to save error records

printk() is not safe to use in MCE context. Add a lockless
memory allocator pool to save error records in MCE context.
Those records will be issued later, in a printk-safe context.
The idea is inspired by the APEI/GHES driver.

We're very conservative and allocate only two pages for it but
since we're going to use those pages throughout the system's
lifetime, we allocate them statically to avoid early boot time
allocation woes.
