btrfs: Use ref_cnt for set_block_group_ro()

More than one code call set_block_group_ro() and restore rw in fail.

Old code use bool bit to save blockgroup's ro state, it can not
support parallel case(it is confirmd exist in my debug log).

This patch use ref count to store ro state, and rename
set_block_group_ro/set_block_group_rw
to
inc_block_group_ro/dec_block_group_ro.
