[media] v4l: omap3isp: Fix async notifier registration order

The async notifier was registered before the v4l2_device was registered and
before the notifier callbacks were set. This could lead to missing the
bound() and complete() callbacks and to attempting to spin_lock() and
uninitialised spin lock.

Also fix unregistering the async notifier in the case of an error --- the
function may not fail anymore after the notifier is registered.
