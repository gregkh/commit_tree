rcu: Stop disabling CPU hotplug in synchronize_rcu_expedited()

The fact that tasks could be migrated from leaf to root rcu_node
structures meant that synchronize_rcu_expedited() had to disable
CPU hotplug.  However, tasks now stay put, so this commit removes the
CPU-hotplug disabling from synchronize_rcu_expedited().
