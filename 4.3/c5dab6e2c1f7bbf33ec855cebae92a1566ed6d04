ARM: socfpga: dts: Correct the parent clock for l3_sp_clk and dbg_clk

The l3_sp_clk's parent should be the l3_mp_clk. This will account for
the extra divider that is present for the l3_mp_clk.

The dbg_clk's parent should be the dbg_at_clk. This will account for
the extra divider that is present for the dbg_at_clk.
