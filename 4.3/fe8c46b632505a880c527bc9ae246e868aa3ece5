coccinelle: returnvar: Use imperative mood

According to Documentation/SubmittingPatches:

"Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz"
instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy
to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change
its behaviour."

So do as recommended.
