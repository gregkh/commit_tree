perf/x86/intel: Add Intel Skylake PMU support

Add perf core PMU support for future Intel Skylake CPU cores.

The code is based on Haswell/Broadwell.

There is a new cache event list, based on the updated Haswell
event list.

Skylake has removed most counter constraints on basic
events, so the basic constraints table now only has a single
entry (plus the fixed counters).

TSX support and various other setups are all shared with Haswell.

Skylake has 32 LBR entries. Add a new LBR init function
to set this up. The filters are all the same as Haswell.

It also has a new LBR format with a separate LBR_INFO_* MSR,
but that has been already added earlier.
