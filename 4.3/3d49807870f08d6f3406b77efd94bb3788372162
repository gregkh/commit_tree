perf tools: Add new Intel PT packet definitions

New features have been added to Intel PT which include a number of new
packet definitions.

This patch adds packet definitions for new packets: TMA, MTC, CYC, VMCS,
TRACESTOP and MNT.  Also another bit in PIP is defined.

This patch only adds support for the definitions. Later patches add
support for decoding TMA, MTC, CYC and TRACESTOP which is where those
packets are explained.

VMCS and the newly defined bit in PIP are used with virtualization which
is not supported yet.  MNT is a maintenance packet which the decoder
should ignore.

For details, refer to the June 2015 or later Intel 64 and IA-32
Architectures SDM Chapter 36 Intel Processor Trace.
