drm/i915: add the FBC mutex

Make sure we're not going to have weird races in really weird cases
where a lot of different CRTCs are doing rendering and modesets at the
same time.

With this change and the stolen_lock from the previous patch, we can
start removing the struct_mutex locking we have around FBC in the next
patches.

v2:
 - Rebase (6 months later)
 - Also lock debugfs and stolen.
v3:
 - Don't lock a single value read (Chris).
 - Replace lockdep assertions with WARNs (Daniel).
 - Improve commit message.
 - Don't forget intel_pre_plane_update() locking.
v4:
 - Don't remove struct_mutex at intel_pre_plane_update() (Chris).
 - Add comment regarding locking dependencies (Chris).
 - Rebase after the stolen code rework.
 - Rebase again after drm-intel-nightly changes.
v5:
 - Rebase after the new stolen_lock patch.
