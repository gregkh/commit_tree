s390/compat: correct uc_sigmask of the compat signal frame

The uc_sigmask in the ucontext structure is an array of words to keep
the 64 signal bits (or 1024 if you ask glibc but the kernel sigset_t
only has 64 bits).

For 64 bit the sigset_t contains a single 8 byte word, but for 31 bit
there are two 4 byte words. The compat signal handler code uses a
simple copy of the 64 bit sigset_t to the 31 bit compat_sigset_t.
As s390 is a big-endian architecture this is incorrect, the two words
in the 31 bit sigset_t array need to be swapped.
