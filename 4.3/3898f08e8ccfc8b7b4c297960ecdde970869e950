mpt3sas: Complete the SCSI command with DID_RESET status for log_info value 0x0x32010081

For any SCSI command, if the driver receives
IOC status = SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED and log info = 0x32010081 then
that command will be completed with DID_RESET host status.

The definition of this log info value is
"Virtual IO has failed and has to be retried".

Firmware will provide this log info value with IOC Status
"SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED", whenever a drive (with is a part of a volume)
is pulled and pushed back within some minimal delay.
With this log info value, firmware informs the driver to retry the
failed IO command infinite times, so to provide some time for the
firmware to discover the reinserted drive successfully instated of
just retrying failed command for five times(doesn't giving enough
time for firmware to complete the drive discovery) and failing the
IO permanently even though drive came back successfully.
