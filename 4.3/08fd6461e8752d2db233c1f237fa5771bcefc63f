KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Allow HW interrupts to be queued to a guest

To allow a HW interrupt to be injected into a guest, we lookup the
guest virtual interrupt in the irq_phys_map list, and if we have
a match, encode both interrupts in the LR.

We also mark the interrupt as "active" at the host distributor level.

On guest EOI on the virtual interrupt, the host interrupt will be
deactivated.
