[media] coda: clamp frame sequence counters to 16 bit

This is already done for one side of the comparison with the expectation
that the HW counter rolls over at the 16 bit boundary. This is true when
decoding a h.264 stream, but doesn't hold for at least MJPEG. As we don't
know the exact wrap-around point for this format just clamp the HW counter
to the same 16 bits. This should be enough to detect most of the errors
and saves us from doing different comparisons based on the decoded format.
