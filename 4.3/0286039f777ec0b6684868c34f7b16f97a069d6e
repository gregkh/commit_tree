perf tools: Add new PERF_RECORD_SWITCH event

Support processing of PERF_RECORD_SWITCH events and
PERF_RECORD_SWITCH_CPU_WIDE events. There is a single
tools callback for them both so that the tool must
check the event type before using the extra members
in PERF_RECORD_SWITCH_CPU_WIDE.

There is still no way to select the events, though.
That is added in a subsequest patch.
