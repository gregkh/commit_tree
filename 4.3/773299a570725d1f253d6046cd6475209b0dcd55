KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Prevent userspace injection of a mapped interrupt

Virtual interrupts mapped to a HW interrupt should only be triggered
from inside the kernel. Otherwise, you could end up confusing the
kernel (and the GIC's) state machine.

Rearrange the injection path so that kvm_vgic_inject_irq is
used for non-mapped interrupts, and kvm_vgic_inject_mapped_irq is
used for mapped interrupts. The latter should only be called from
inside the kernel (timer, irqfd).
