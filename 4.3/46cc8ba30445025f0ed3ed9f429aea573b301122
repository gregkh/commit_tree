nfsd: don't WARN/backtrace for invalid container deployment.

These messages, combined with the backtrace they trigger, makes it seem
like a serious problem, though a quick search shows distros marking
it as a "won't fix" non-issue when the problem is reported by users.

The backtrace is overkill, and only really manages to show that if
you follow the code path, you can't really avoid it with bootargs
or configuration settings in the container.

Given that, lets tone it down a bit and get rid of the WARN severity,
and the associated backtrace, so people aren't needlessly alarmed.

Also, lets drop the split printk line, since they are grep unfriendly.
