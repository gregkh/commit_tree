blkcg: separate out tg_conf_updated() from tg_set_conf()

tg_set_conf() is largely consisted of parsing and setting the new
config and the follow-up application and propagation.  This patch
separates out the latter part into tg_conf_updated().  This will be
used to implement interface for the unified hierarchy.
