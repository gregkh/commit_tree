ipv6: fix multipath route replace error recovery

Problem:
The ecmp route replace support for ipv6 in the kernel, deletes the
existing ecmp route too early, ie when it installs the first nexthop.
If there is an error in installing the subsequent nexthops, its too late
to recover the already deleted existing route leaving the fib
in an inconsistent state.

This patch reduces the possibility of this by doing the following:
a) Changes the existing multipath route add code to a two stage process:
  build rt6_infos + insert them
	ip6_route_add rt6_info creation code is moved into
	ip6_route_info_create.
b) This ensures that most errors are caught during building rt6_infos
  and we fail early
c) Separates multipath add and del code. Because add needs the special
  two stage mode in a) and delete essentially does not care.
d) In any event if the code fails during inserting a route again, a
  warning is printed (This should be unlikely)

Before the patch:
$ip -6 route show
3000:1000:1000:1000::2 via fe80::202:ff:fe00:b dev swp49s0 metric 1024
3000:1000:1000:1000::2 via fe80::202:ff:fe00:d dev swp49s1 metric 1024
3000:1000:1000:1000::2 via fe80::202:ff:fe00:f dev swp49s2 metric 1024

/* Try replacing the route with a duplicate nexthop */
$ip -6 route change 3000:1000:1000:1000::2/128 nexthop via
fe80::202:ff:fe00:b dev swp49s0 nexthop via fe80::202:ff:fe00:d dev
swp49s1 nexthop via fe80::202:ff:fe00:d dev swp49s1

After the patch:
$ip -6 route show

3000:1000:1000:1000::2 via fe80::202:ff:fe00:f dev swp49s2 metric 1024

/* Try replacing the route with a duplicate nexthop */
$ip -6 route change 3000:1000:1000:1000::2/128 nexthop via
