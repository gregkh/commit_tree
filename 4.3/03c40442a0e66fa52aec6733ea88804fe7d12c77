IB/uverbs: Fix reference counting usage of event files

Fix the reference counting usage to be handled in the event file
creation/destruction function, instead of being done by the caller.
This is done for both async/non-async event files.

Based on Jason Gunthorpe report at https://www.mail-archive.com/
linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org/msg24680.html:
"The existing code for this is broken, in ib_uverbs_get_context all
the error paths between ib_uverbs_alloc_event_file and the
kref_get(file->ref) are wrong - this will result in fput() which will
call ib_uverbs_event_close, which will try to do kref_put and
ib_unregister_event_handler - which are no longer paired."
