mwifiex: fix for p2p broken link

This patch fixes following issues in p2p code paths.

1) bss role, bss type and connection type was not set correctly
for p2p GO and p2p client at couple of places.
2) Driver appends a proprietary header to management frames
which will be parsed by our firmware. Later while informing
TX status to cfg80211, modified frame buffer was passed to
cfg80211_mgmt_tx_status() instead of original one.
