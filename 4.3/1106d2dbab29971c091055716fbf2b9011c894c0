drivers/tty: make serial/lantic.c driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this option is currently:

config SERIAL_LANTIQ
    bool "Lantiq serial driver"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the couple traces of modularity, so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We delete the MODULE_DESCRIPTION and LICENSE tags since they are
not adding any new information above and beyond what is at the top
of the file.  Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for
non-modular code, so we remove that as well.
