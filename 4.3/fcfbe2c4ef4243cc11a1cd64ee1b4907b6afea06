xfs: log recovery needs to validate against sb_meta_uuid

Now that sb_uuid can be changed by the user, we cannot use this to
validate the metadata blocks being recovered belong to this
filesystem. We must check against the sb_meta_uuid as that will
remain unchanged.

There is a complication in this code - the superblock itself. We can
not check the sb_meta_uuid unconditionally, as that may not be set
on disk. Hence we must verify the superblock sb_uuid matches between
the log record and the in-core superblock.

Found by inspection after the previous two problems were found.
