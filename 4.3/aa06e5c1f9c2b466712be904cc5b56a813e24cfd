ARM: entry: get rid of multiple macro definitions

The following structure is just asking for trouble:

 #ifdef CONFIG_symbol
	.macro foo
	...
	.endm
	.macro bar
	...
	.endm
	.macro baz
	...
	.endm
 #else
	.macro foo
	...
	.endm
	.macro bar
	...
	.endm
 #ifdef CONFIG_symbol2
	.macro baz
	...
	.endm
 #else
	.macro baz
	...
	.endm
 #endif
 #endif

such as one defintion being updated, but the other definitions miss out.
Where the contents of a macro needs to be conditional, the hint is in
the first clause of this very sentence.  "contents" "conditional".  Not
multiple separate definitions, especially not when much of the macro
is the same between different configs.

This patch fixes this bad style, which had caused the Thumb2 code to
miss-out on the uaccess updates.
