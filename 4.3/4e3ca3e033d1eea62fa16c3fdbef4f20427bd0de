mm/mempool: allow NULL `pool' pointer in mempool_destroy()

mempool_destroy() does not tolerate a NULL mempool_t pointer argument and
performs a NULL-pointer dereference.  This requires additional attention
and effort from developers/reviewers and forces all mempool_destroy()
callers to do a NULL check

    if (pool)
        mempool_destroy(pool);

Or, otherwise, be invalid mempool_destroy() users.

Tweak mempool_destroy() and NULL-check the pointer there.

Proposed by Andrew Morton.
