ASoC: rt5645: Update dapm pins when the card is not instantiated yet

This makes sure the dapm state is consistent when the card is
instantiated.

However, if the card is not instantiated yet, we still update the
registers manually in the "jack in" case, so that we can immediately
report if a mic is present or not.

Disabling "Mic Det Power" after detection, and on jack out, can
wait until the card gets instantiated.
