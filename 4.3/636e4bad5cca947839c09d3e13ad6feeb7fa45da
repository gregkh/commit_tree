ASoC: rsnd: dvc: make sure DVC soft reset

Renesas SCU (Sampling Rate Convert Unit) includes SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC,
and these have similar register. xxxRSR (Software reset Register) is one
of them. These xxxRSR need be set to 1 to 0 when software reset.
Current rsnd driver has src.c / dvc.c, and we will have mix.c.
It is readable if these have same named function.
This patch adds rsnd_dvc_soft_reset() and make sure it
