netfilter: bridge: fix routing of bridge frames with call-iptables=1

We can't re-use the physoutdev storage area.

1.  When using NFQUEUE in PREROUTING, we attempt to bump a bogus
refcnt since nf_bridge->physoutdev is garbage (ipv4/ipv6 address)

2. for same reason, we crash in physdev match in FORWARD or later if
skb is routed instead of bridged.

This increases nf_bridge_info to 40 bytes, but we have no other choice.

Fixes: 72b1e5e4cac7 ("netfilter: bridge: reduce nf_bridge_info to 32 bytes again")
