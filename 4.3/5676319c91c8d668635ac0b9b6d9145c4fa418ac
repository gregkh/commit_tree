MIPS: Kconfig: Disable MIPS MT and SMP implementations for R6

R6 does not support the MIPS MT ASE and the CMP/SMP options so
restrict them in order to prevent users from selecting incompatible
SMP configuration for R6 cores. We also disable the CPS/SMP option
because its support hasn't been added to the CPS code yet.
