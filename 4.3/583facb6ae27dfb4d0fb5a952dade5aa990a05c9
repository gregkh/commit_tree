pinctrl: samsung: remove "out of memory" messages

Checkpatch.pl complains about these:

WARNING: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message

The messages use a little extra RAM and they add a few extra lines of
code.  We're probably never going to hit these out of memory situations
but if we did then kmalloc() has pretty good error messages built-in.
