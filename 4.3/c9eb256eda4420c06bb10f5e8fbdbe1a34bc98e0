xfs: return errors from partial I/O failures to files

There is an issue with xfs's error reporting in some cases of I/O partially
failing and partially succeeding. Calls like fsync() can report success even
though not all I/O was successful in partial-failure cases such as one disk of
a RAID0 array being offline.

The issue can occur when there are more than one bio per xfs_ioend struct.
Each call to xfs_end_bio() for a bio completing will write a value to
ioend->io_error.  If a successful bio completes after any failed bio, no
error is reported do to it writing 0 over the error code set by any failed bio.
The I/O error information is now lost and when the ioend is completed
only success is reported back up the filesystem stack.

xfs_end_bio() should only set ioend->io_error in the case of BIO_UPTODATE
being clear.  ioend->io_error is initialized to 0 at allocation so only needs
to be updated by a failed bio. Also check that ioend->io_error is 0 so that
the first error reported will be the error code returned.
