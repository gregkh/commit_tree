serial: 8250_omap: introduce "ti,am3352-uart" compatible property

Use of of_machine_is_compatible() for handling AM335x specific
"DMA kick" quirk in 8250_omap driver makes it ugly to extend the
quirk for other platforms. Instead use a new compatible.

The new compatible will also make it easier to take care of
other quirks on AM335x and like SoCs.

In order to not break backward DTB compatibility for users of
8250_omap driver on AM335x based boards, existing use of
of_machine_is_compatible() has not been removed.
