Drivers: hv: vmbus: add special crash handler

Full kernel hang is observed when kdump kernel starts after a crash. This
hang happens in vmbus_negotiate_version() function on
wait_for_completion() as Hyper-V host (Win2012R2 in my testing) never
responds to CHANNELMSG_INITIATE_CONTACT as it thinks the connection is
already established. We need to perform some mandatory minimalistic
cleanup before we start new kernel.
