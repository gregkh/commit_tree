regmap: Use reg_sequence for multi_reg_write / register_patch

Separate the functionality using sequences of register writes from the
functions that take register defaults. This change renames the arguments
in order to support the extension of reg_sequence to take an optional
delay to be applied after any given register in a sequence is written.
This avoids adding an int to all register defaults, which could
substantially increase memory usage for regmaps with large default tables.

This also updates all the clients of multi_reg_write/register_patch.
