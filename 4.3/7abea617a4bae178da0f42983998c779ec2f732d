rtc: ds1307: Support optional wakeup interrupt source

With the recent pinctrl-single changes, SoCs such as Texas
Instrument's OMAP processors can treat wake-up events from deeper idle
states as interrupts.

Let's add support for the optional second interrupt for wake-up using
the generic wakeirq support added in commit 4990d4fe327b ("PM /
Wakeirq: Add automated device wake IRQ handling")

Finally, to pass the wake-up interrupt in the dts file,
interrupts-extended property needs to be passed.

This is similar in approach to commit 2a0b965cfb6e ("serial: omap: Add
support for optional wake-up") + ee83bd3b6483 ("serial: omap: Switch
wake-up interrupt to generic wakeirq")
