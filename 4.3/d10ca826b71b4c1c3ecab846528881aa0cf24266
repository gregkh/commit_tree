drm: bridge/dw_hdmi: remove pixel repetition setting for all VICs

dw_hdmi sets a pixel repetition factor of 1 for VICs 10-15, 25-30 and
35-38.  However, DRM uses their native resolutions in its timing
information.  For example, VIC 14 can be 1440x480 with no repetition,
or 720x480 with one pixel repetition.  As DRM uses 1440 pixels per line
for this video mode, we need no pixel repetition.

In any case, pixel repetition appears broken in dw_hdmi.
