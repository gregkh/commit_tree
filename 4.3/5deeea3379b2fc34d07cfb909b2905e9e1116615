staging: unisys: prevent faults in visornic_pause

Prevent faults in visornic_pause, visornic_resume(), and visornic_remove()

Prior to this patch, any call to visornic_pause(), visornic_resume(), or
visornic_remove() would fault, due to dev_set_drvdata() never having been
called to stash our struct visornic_devdata * into the device's drvdata.
I.e., all calls to dev_get_drvdata() were returning NULL, meaning a fault
was soon to follow.
