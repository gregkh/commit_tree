vmscan: fix sane_reclaim helper for legacy memcg

The sane_reclaim() helper is supposed to return false for memcg reclaim
if the legacy hierarchy is used, because the latter lacks dirty
throttling mechanism, and so it did before it was accidentally broken by
commit 33398cf2f360c ("memcg: export struct mem_cgroup").  Fix it.
