staging: ft1000: convert pack pragma to __packed

Convert a Microsoft compiler specific directive "#pragma pack(1)" to a
GCC equivalent __packed. Also, by doing this we save
ourselves from trouble if any other struct definitions are added after
the #pragma because it will be applied to all of the definitions
following it.
