perf tools: /proc/kcore requires CAP_SYS_RAWIO message too noisy

The "/proc/kcore requires CAP_SYS_RAWIO" message comes up all the time
for 'perf script' if vmlinux is not found and the user isn't root, even
when the kernel is not being traced and even though the message is only
really relevant for annotation.

Change it to pr_debug and instead put a note in the message displayed if
annotation is not possible.

Also, the file being accessed might not be /proc/kcore.  Tools can be
directed to a different location using the --kallsyms option in which
case kcore is expected to be in the same directory.  Adjust the message
so it is not misleading in that case.
