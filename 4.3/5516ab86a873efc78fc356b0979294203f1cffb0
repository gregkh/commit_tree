drm/amdgpu: don't grab dev->struct_mutex in pm functions

Similar to radeon, except that amdgpu doesn't even use struct_mutex to
protect anything like the shared z buffer (sane gpu architecture,
yay!). And the code already grabs the globa adev->ring_lock, so this
code can't race with itself. Which makes struct_mutex completely
redundnant. Remove it.
