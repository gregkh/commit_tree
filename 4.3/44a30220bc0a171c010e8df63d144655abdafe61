shmem: recalculate file inode when fstat

Shmem uses shmem_recalc_inode to update i_blocks when it allocates page,
undoes range or swaps.  But mm can drop clean page without notifying
shmem.  This makes fstat sometimes return out-of-date block size.

The problem can be partially solved when we add
inode_operations->getattr which calls shmem_recalc_inode to update
i_blocks for fstat.

shmem_recalc_inode also updates counter used by statfs and
vm_committed_as.  For them the situation is not changed.  They still
suffer from the discrepancy after dropping clean page and before the
function is called by aforementioned triggers.
