mei: do not access freed cb in blocking write

The mei_cl_write function is giving up on a write cb ownership after it
was sent or queued. The write cb is then freed in the completion
handler. Especially during blocking write mei_cl_write function waits
for the completion handler and then access the freed memory to fetch the
written size.  The quick fix is to store the buffer size prior to
sending, the size is not altered during the flow.
