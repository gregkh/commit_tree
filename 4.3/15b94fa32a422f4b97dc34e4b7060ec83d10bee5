ACPI / EC: Fix a memory leak issue in acpi_ec_query()

When query handler is not found, "result" is actually stil 0, and
"struct acpi_ec_query" is not NULL, so the deletion code of
"struct acpi_ec_query" at the end of the function cannot be invoked.
As a consequence, memory leak can be observed.

The issue is introduced by this commit:
