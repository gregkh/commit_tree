[media] coda: add macroblock tiling support

Storing internal frames in macroblock tiled order improves memory
access patterns by allowing increased burst sizes when transferring
the uncompressed macroblocks to or from main memory.
The translation logic only supports a single chroma base address,
so this is only supported for the chroma interleaved NV12 format.

Since the rotator used to copy the decoder output into the v4l2
capture buffers does not seem to support the tiled format correctly,
only enable it in the encoder for now.
