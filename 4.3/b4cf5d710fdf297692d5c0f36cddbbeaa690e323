clockevents/drivers/bcm_kona: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate bcm_kona driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
the clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked
obsolete now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

Oneshot callback isn't required as it was empty.
