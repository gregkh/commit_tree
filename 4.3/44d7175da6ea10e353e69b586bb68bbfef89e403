mm/dmapool: allow NULL `pool' pointer in dma_pool_destroy()

dma_pool_destroy() does not tolerate a NULL dma_pool pointer argument and
performs a NULL-pointer dereference.  This requires additional attention
and effort from developers/reviewers and forces all dma_pool_destroy()
callers to do a NULL check

    if (pool)
        dma_pool_destroy(pool);

Or, otherwise, be invalid dma_pool_destroy() users.

Tweak dma_pool_destroy() and NULL-check the pointer there.

Proposed by Andrew Morton.
