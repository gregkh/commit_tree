drm/fbdev-helper: Grab mode_config.mutex in drm_fb_helper_single_add_all_connectors

This is now truly only duct-tape to keep locking checks happy since
calling this function when hpd or polling are already enabled is a
bug. The fbdev helper can't cope with hotplug changes yet at this
point, only after that.

Otoh a bit more robustness in this function can't hurt, and with this
fbdev can actually cope with hotplug changes. And it's also more
consistent with the connector hotadd/remove dp mst needs to do.
Therefore document this as new official behavior.
