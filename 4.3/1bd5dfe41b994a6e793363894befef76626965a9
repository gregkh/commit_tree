ARM: OMAP1: fix incorrect INT_DMA_LCD

Commit 685e2d08c54b ("ARM: OMAP1: Change interrupt numbering for
sparse IRQ") turned on SPARSE_IRQ on OMAP1, but forgot to change
the number of INT_DMA_LCD. This broke the boot at least on Nokia 770,
where the device hangs during framebuffer initialization.

Fix by defining INT_DMA_LCD like the other interrupts.
