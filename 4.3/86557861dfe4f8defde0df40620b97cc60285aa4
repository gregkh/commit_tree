btrfs: skip superblocks during discard

Btrfs doesn't track superblocks with extent records so there is nothing
persistent on-disk to indicate that those blocks are in use.  We track
the superblocks in memory to ensure they don't get used by removing them
from the free space cache when we load a block group from disk.  Prior
to 47ab2a6c6a (Btrfs: remove empty block groups automatically), that
was fine since the block group would never be reclaimed so the superblock
was always safe.  Once we started removing the empty block groups, we
were protected by the fact that discards weren't being properly issued
for unused space either via FITRIM or -odiscard.  The block groups were
still being released, but the blocks remained on disk.

In order to properly discard unused block groups, we need to filter out
the superblocks from the discard range.  Superblocks are located at fixed
locations on each device, so it makes sense to filter them out in
btrfs_issue_discard, which is used by both -odiscard and FITRIM.
