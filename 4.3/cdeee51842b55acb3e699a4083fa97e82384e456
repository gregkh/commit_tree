KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Implement H_CLEAR_REF and H_CLEAR_MOD

This adds implementations for the H_CLEAR_REF (test and clear reference
bit) and H_CLEAR_MOD (test and clear changed bit) hypercalls.

When clearing the reference or change bit in the guest view of the HPTE,
we also have to clear it in the real HPTE so that we can detect future
references or changes.  When we do so, we transfer the R or C bit value
to the rmap entry for the underlying host page so that kvm_age_hva_hv(),
kvm_test_age_hva_hv() and kvmppc_hv_get_dirty_log() know that the page
has been referenced and/or changed.

These hypercalls are not used by Linux guests.  These implementations
have been tested using a FreeBSD guest.
