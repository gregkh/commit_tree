scsi: retry MODE SENSE on unit attention

The 'sd' driver is calling scsi_mode_sense() to figure out
internal details. But scsi_mode_sense() never checks for
any pending unit attentions, so we're getting annoying error
messages like:

MODE SENSE: unimplemented page/subpage: 0x00/0x00

and a possible wrong decision for device cache handling.
