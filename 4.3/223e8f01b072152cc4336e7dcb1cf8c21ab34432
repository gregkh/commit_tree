sysfs.txt: update show method notes about sprintf/snprintf/scnprintf usage

Changed the documentation to allow sprintf() when the buffer
provided by sysfs cannot be overflowed. Explicitly say
snprintf() must never be used in a show function to format
data to be returned to user space.

Change based on a discussion about the patch
st: convert DRIVER_ATTR macros to DRIVER_ATTR_RO
