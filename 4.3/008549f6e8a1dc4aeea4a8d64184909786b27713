mpt2sas: Refcount fw_events and fix unsafe list usage

The fw_event_work struct is concurrently referenced at shutdown, so
add a refcount to protect it, and refactor the code to use it.

Additionally, refactor _scsih_fw_event_cleanup_queue() such that it
no longer iterates over the list without holding the lock, since
_firmware_event_work() concurrently deletes items from the list.
