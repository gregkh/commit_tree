regulator: core: Drop regulator_list_mutex when we're done with it on remove

When removing a regulator we hold regulator_list_mutex in order to
ensure the regualtor doesn't become removed again.  However we only need
to protect the list until we remove the regulator from the list so move
the unlock earlier to reduce the locked region.
