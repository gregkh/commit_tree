KVM: arm64: re-factor hyp.S debug register code

This is a pre-cursor to sharing the code with the guest debug support.
This replaces the big macro that fishes data out of a fixed location
with a more general helper macro to restore a set of debug registers. It
uses macro substitution so it can be re-used for debug control and value
registers. It does however rely on the debug registers being 64 bit
aligned (as they happen to be in the hyp ABI).
