[media] rc-core: remove the LIRC "protocol"

The LIRC protocol was always a bad fit and if we're ever going to expose
protocol numbers in a user-space API, it'd be better to get rid of the
LIRC "protocol" first.

The sysfs API is kept backwards compatible by always listing the lirc
protocol as present and enabled.
