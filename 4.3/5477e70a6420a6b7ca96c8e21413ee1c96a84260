mm: move ->mremap() from file_operations to vm_operations_struct

vma->vm_ops->mremap() looks more natural and clean in move_vma(), and this
way ->mremap() can have more users.  Say, vdso.

While at it, s/aio_ring_remap/aio_ring_mremap/.

Note: this is the minimal change before ->mremap() finds another user in
file_operations; this method should have more arguments, and it can be
used to kill arch_remap().
