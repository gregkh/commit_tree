x86/mm/pat: Make mm/pageattr[-test].c explicitly non-modular

The file pageattr.c is obj-y and it includes pageattr-test.c
based on CPA_DEBUG (a bool), meaning that no code here is
currently being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity so that when reading
the code there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the
non-modular case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this
commit.
