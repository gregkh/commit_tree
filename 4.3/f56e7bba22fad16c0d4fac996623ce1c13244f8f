igb: Pull timestamp from fragment before adding it to skb

This change makes it so that we pull the timestamp from the fragment before
we add it to the skb.  By doing this we can avoid a possible issue in which
the fragment can possibly be less than IGB_RX_HDR_LEN due to the timestamp
being pulled after the copybreak check.

While making this change I realized we could also pull the rest of the
igb_pull_tail function into igb_add_rx_frag since in the case of igb,
unlike ixgbe, we are able to unmap the entire buffer before calling
add_rx_frag so merging the two allows for sharing of code between the two
merged functions.
