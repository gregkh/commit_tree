cgroup: allow a cgroup subsystem to reject a fork

Add a new cgroup subsystem callback can_fork that conditionally
states whether or not the fork is accepted or rejected by a cgroup
policy. In addition, add a cancel_fork callback so that if an error
occurs later in the forking process, any state modified by can_fork can
be reverted.

Allow for a private opaque pointer to be passed from cgroup_can_fork to
cgroup_post_fork, allowing for the fork state to be stored by each
subsystem separately.

Also add a tagging system for cgroup_subsys.h to allow for CGROUP_<TAG>
enumerations to be be defined and used. In addition, explicitly add a
CGROUP_CANFORK_COUNT macro to make arrays easier to define.

This is in preparation for implementing the pids cgroup subsystem.
