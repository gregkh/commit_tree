ath10k: enable vdev and peer related operations for 10.4 fw

Most of existing vdev and peer related functions (vdev create,
vdev delete, vdev start, peer create, peer delete, peer flush, etc)
are reusable for 10.4 firmware. Link those general vdev and peer
functions to 10.4 wmi function table.

Existing general pktlog enable/disable, dbglog configuration functions
are reusable for 10.4 and add them also in wmi function table.

Also handle few wmi events (sevice rdy, echo, dbg msg, tbtt offset
update, dbg print) in ath10k_wmi_10_4_op_rx(). wow event is not
applicable in 10.4 firmware, have it under not implemented print.
