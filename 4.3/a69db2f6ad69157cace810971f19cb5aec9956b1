s390/facilities: remove transactional-execution bits

Remove the two facility bits

50 - constrained transactional-execution facility
74 - transactional-execution facility

from the required facilities if the kernel is built with -march=zEC12.

E.g. z/VM 6.3 doesn't virtualize the TX facility yet. Therefore a kernel
built with -march=zEC12 and ipl'ed on a zEC12 machine as a z/VM 6.3 guest
will emit a message about the missing facilities and stop working.

The kernel however doesn't make use of the TX facility, therefore remove
the two TX related facility bits and fix this unpleasant behavior.
