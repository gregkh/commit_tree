dm cache: the CLEAN_SHUTDOWN flag was not being set

If the CLEAN_SHUTDOWN flag is not set when a cache is loaded then all cache
blocks are marked as dirty and a full writeback occurs.

__commit_transaction() is responsible for setting/clearing
CLEAN_SHUTDOWN (based the flags_mutator that is passed in).

Fix this issue, of the cache's on-disk flags being wrong, by making sure
__commit_transaction() does not reset the flags after the mutator has
altered the flags in preparation for them being serialized to disk.

before:

sb_flags = mutator(le32_to_cpu(disk_super->flags));
disk_super->flags = cpu_to_le32(sb_flags);
disk_super->flags = cpu_to_le32(cmd->flags);

after:

disk_super->flags = cpu_to_le32(cmd->flags);
sb_flags = mutator(le32_to_cpu(disk_super->flags));
disk_super->flags = cpu_to_le32(sb_flags);
