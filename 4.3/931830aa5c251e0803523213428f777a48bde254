HID: gembird: add new driver to fix Gembird JPD-DualForce 2

This gamepad advertise 5 absolute axis while 4 are actually used.
The second Z axis shows some garbage, so it has to be ignored by HID.
The first Z axis and the Rz one are actually Rx and Ry. Remap them.

We could also just remap and ignore the axis in .input_mapping(). I
went ahead with .report_fixup() first, so here it is.
