spi: davinci: Set prescale value based on register value

Within davinci_spi_get_prescale() the prescale has two meanings. First one
being the calculated prescale value and then at the end translates it to the
prescale value that will be written to the SPI register.

At first glance this can be confusing especially when comparing the minimum
prescale value against what is seen in the TRM.

To simplify things make it clear that the calculated prescale value will always
be based on the value that will be written into the SPI register.
