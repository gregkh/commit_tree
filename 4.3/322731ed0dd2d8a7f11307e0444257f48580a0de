cfq-iosched: move cfq_group determination from cfq_find_alloc_queue() to cfq_get_queue()

This is necessary for making async cfq_cgroups per-cfq_group instead
of per-cfq_data.  While this change makes cfq_get_queue() perform RCU
locking and look up cfq_group even when it reuses async queue, the
extra overhead is extremely unlikely to be noticeable given that this
is already sitting behind cic->cfqq[] cache and the overall cost of
cfq operation.
