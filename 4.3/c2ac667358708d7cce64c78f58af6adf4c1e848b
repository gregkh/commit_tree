openvswitch: Allow matching on conntrack label

Allow matching and setting the ct_label field. As with ct_mark, this is
populated by executing the CT action. The label field may be modified by
specifying a label and mask nested under the CT action. It is stored as
metadata attached to the connection. Label modification occurs after
lookup, and will only persist when the conntrack entry is committed by
providing the COMMIT flag to the CT action. Labels are currently fixed
to 128 bits in size.
