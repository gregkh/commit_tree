md/raid5: remove incorrect "min_t()" when calculating writepos.

This code is calculating:
  writepos, which is the furthest along address (device-space) that we
     *will* be writing to
  readpos, which is the earliest address that we *could* possible read
     from, and
  safepos, which is the earliest address in the 'old' section that we
     might read from after a crash when the reshape position is
     recovered from metadata.

  The first is a precise calculation, so clipping at zero doesn't
  make sense.  As the reshape position is now guaranteed to always be
  a multiple of reshape_sectors and as we already BUG_ON when
  reshape_progress is zero, there is no point in this min_t() call.

  The readpos and safepos are worst case - actual value depends on
  precise geometry.  That worst case could be negative, which is only
  a problem because we are storing the value in an unsigned.
  So leave the min_t() for those.
