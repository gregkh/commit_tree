serial: atmel: fix error path of probe function

If atmel_init_gpios fails the port has already been marked as busy (in
line 2629), so this must be undone in the error path.

This bug was introduced because I created the patch that finally
became 722ccf416ac2 ("serial: atmel: fix error handling when
mctrl_gpio_init fails") on top of 3.19 which didn't have commit
6fbb9bdf0f3f ("tty/serial: at91: fix error handling in
atmel_serial_probe()") yet.
