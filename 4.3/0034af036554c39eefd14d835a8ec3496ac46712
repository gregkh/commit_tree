block: make /sys/block/<dev>/queue/discard_max_bytes writeable

Lots of devices support huge discard sizes these days. Depending
on how the device handles them internally, huge discards can
introduce massive latencies (hundreds of msec) on the device side.

We have a sysfs file, discard_max_bytes, that advertises the max
hardware supported discard size. Make this writeable, and split
the settings into a soft and hard limit. This can be set from
'discard_granularity' and up to the hardware limit.

Add a new sysfs file, 'discard_max_hw_bytes', that shows the hw
set limit.
