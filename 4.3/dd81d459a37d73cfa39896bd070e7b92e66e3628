btrfs: fix search key advancing condition

The search key advancing condition used in copy_to_sk() is loose. It can
advance the key even if it reaches sk->max_*: e.g. when the max key = (512,
1024, -1) and the current key = (512, 1025, 10), it increments the
offset by 1, continues hopeless search from (512, 1025, 11). This issue
make ioctl() to take unexpectedly long time scanning all the leaf a blocks
one by one.

This commit fix the problem using standard way of key comparison:
btrfs_comp_cpu_keys()
