rcu: Make synchronize_rcu_expedited() use sequence-counter scheme

Although synchronize_rcu_expedited() uses a sequence-counter scheme, it
is based on a single increment per grace period, which means that tasks
piggybacking off of concurrent grace periods may be forced to wait longer
than necessary.  This commit therefore applies the new sequence-count
functions developed for synchronize_sched_expedited() to speed things
up a bit and to consolidate the sequence-counter implementation.
