tipc: clean up socket layer message reception

When a message is received in a socket, one of the call chains
tipc_sk_rcv()->tipc_sk_enqueue()->filter_rcv()(->tipc_sk_proto_rcv())
or
tipc_sk_backlog_rcv()->filter_rcv()(->tipc_sk_proto_rcv())
are followed. At each of these levels we may encounter situations
where the message may need to be rejected, or a new message
produced for transfer back to the sender. Despite recent
improvements, the current code for doing this is perceived
as awkward and hard to follow.

Leveraging the two previous commits in this series, we now
introduce a more uniform handling of such situations. We
let each of the functions in the chain itself produce/reverse
the message to be returned to the sender, but also perform the
actual forwarding. This simplifies the necessary logics within
each function.
