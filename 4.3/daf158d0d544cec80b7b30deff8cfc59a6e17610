net: mvneta: fix DMA buffer unmapping in mvneta_rx()

This patch fixes a regression introduced by the commit a84e32894191
("net: mvneta: fix refilling for Rx DMA buffers"). Due to this commit
the newly allocated Rx buffers are DMA-unmapped in place of those passed
to the networking stack. Obviously, this causes data corruptions.

This patch fixes the issue by ensuring that the right Rx buffers are
DMA-unmapped.
