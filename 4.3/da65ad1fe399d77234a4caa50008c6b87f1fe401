net: allow sleeping when modifying store_rps_map

Commit 10e4ea751 ("net: Fix race condition in store_rps_map") has moved the
manipulation of the rps_needed jump label under a spinlock. Since changing
the state of a jump label may sleep this is incorrect and causes warnings
during runtime.

Make rps_map_lock a mutex to allow sleeping under it.
