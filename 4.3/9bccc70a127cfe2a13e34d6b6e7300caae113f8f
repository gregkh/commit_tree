i2c: take address space into account when checking for used addresses

It is not enough to compare the plain address value, we also need to
check the flags enabling a different address space. E.g. it is valid to
have address 0x50 as a 7-bit address and 0x050 as 10-bit address on the
same bus. Same for addresses when we are the slave.
