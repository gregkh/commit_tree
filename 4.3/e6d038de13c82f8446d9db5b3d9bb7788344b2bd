i40evf: handle big resets

The most common type of reset that the VF will encounter is a PF reset
that cascades down into a VF reset for each VF. In this case, the VF
will always be assigned the same VSI and recovery is fairly simple.

However, in the case of 'bigger' resets, such as a Core or EMP reset,
when the device is reinitialized, it's probable that the VF will NOT get
the same VSI. When this happens, the VF will not be able to recover, as
it will continue to request resources for its original VSI.

Add an extra state to the admin queue state machine so that the driver
can re-request its configuration information at runtime. During reset
recovery, set this bit in the aq_required field, and fetch the (possibly
new) configuration information before attempting to bring the driver
back up. Since the driver doesn't know what kind of reset it has
encountered, this step is done even for a PF reset, but it doesn't hurt
anything - it just gets the same VSI back.
