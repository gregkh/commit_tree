gpio: etraxfs: add interrupt support

On ETRAX FS, all pins on the first port (and only the first port) have
interrupt support.

On ARTPEC-3, all pins on all ports have interrupt support.  However,
there are only eight interrupts.  Each of the interrupts is associated
with a group of pins and for each interrupt the one pin from the group
which will trigger it can be selected.
