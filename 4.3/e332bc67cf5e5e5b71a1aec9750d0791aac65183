ipv6: Don't call with rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev

As originally written rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev makes no sense when
called with dev == NULL as it attempts to flush all uncached routes
regardless of network namespace when dev == NULL.  Which is simply
incorrect behavior.

Furthermore at the point rt6_ifdown is called with dev == NULL no more
network devices exist in the network namespace so even if the code in
rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev were to attempt something sensible it
would be meaningless.

Therefore remove support in rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev for handling
network devices where dev == NULL, and only call rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev
 when rt6_ifdown is called with a network device.
