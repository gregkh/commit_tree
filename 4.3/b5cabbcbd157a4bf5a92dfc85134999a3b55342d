perf tools: Fix copying of /proc/kcore

A copy of /proc/kcore containing the kernel text can be made to the
buildid cache. e.g.

	perf buildid-cache -v -k /proc/kcore

To workaround objdump limitations, a copy is also made when annotating
against /proc/kcore.

The copying process stops working from libelf about v1.62 onwards (the
problem was found with v1.63).

The cause is that a call to gelf_getphdr() in kcore__add_phdr() fails
because additional validation has been added to gelf_getphdr().

The use of gelf_getphdr() is a misguided attempt to get default
initialization of the Gelf_Phdr structure.  That should not be
necessary because every member of the Gelf_Phdr structure is
subsequently assigned.  So just remove the call to gelf_getphdr().

Similarly, a call to gelf_getehdr() in gelf_kcore__init() can be
removed also.

Committer notes:

Note to stable@kernel.org, from Adrian in the cover letter for this
patchkit:

The "Fix copying of /proc/kcore" problem goes back to v3.13 if you think
it is important enough for stable.
