netfilter: nft_compat: skip family comparison in case of NFPROTO_UNSPEC

Fix lookup of existing match/target structures in the corresponding list
by skipping the family check if NFPROTO_UNSPEC is used.

This is resulting in the allocation and insertion of one match/target
structure for each use of them. So this not only bloats memory
consumption but also severely affects the time to reload the ruleset
from the iptables-compat utility.

After this patch, iptables-compat-restore and iptables-compat take
almost the same time to reload large rulesets.
