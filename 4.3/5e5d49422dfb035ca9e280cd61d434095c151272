e100: Release skb when DMA mapping is failed in e100_xmit_prepare

When pci_dma_mapping_error in e100_xmit_prepare is failed, the skb buffer
allocated by netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align in e100_rx_alloc_skb is not
released, which causes a possible resource leak.
This patch adds error handling code to fix it.
