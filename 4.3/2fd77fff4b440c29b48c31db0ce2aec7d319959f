PM / suspend: make sync() on suspend-to-RAM build-time optional

The Linux kernel suspend path has traditionally invoked sys_sync()
before freezing user threads.

But sys_sync() can be expensive, and some user-space OS's do not want
the kernel to pay the cost of sys_sync() on every suspend -- preferring
invoke sync() from user-space if/when they want it.

So make sys_sync on suspend build-time optional.

The default is unchanged.
