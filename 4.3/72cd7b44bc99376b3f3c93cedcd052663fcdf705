powerpc: Uncomment and make enable_kernel_vsx() routine available

enable_kernel_vsx() function was commented since anything was using
it. However, vmx-crypto driver uses VSX instructions which are
only available if VSX is enable. Otherwise it rises an exception oops.

This patch uncomment enable_kernel_vsx() routine and makes it available.
