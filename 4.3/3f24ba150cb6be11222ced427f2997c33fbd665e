KVM: s390: Fixup interrupt vcpu event messages and levels

This reworks the debug logging for interrupt related logs.
Several changes:
- unify program int/irq
- improve decoding (e.g. use mcic instead of parm64 for machine
  check injection)
- remove useless interrupt type number (the name is enough)
- rename "interrupt:" to "deliver:" as the other side is called "inject"
- use log level 3 for state changing and/or seldom events (like machine
  checks, restart..)
- use log level 4 for frequent events
- use 0x prefix for hex numbers
- add pfault done logging
- move some tracing outside spinlock
