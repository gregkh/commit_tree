tracing: Don't make assumptions about length of string on task rename

While the dest comm string size is assured to be at least TASK_COMM_LEN long,
doing a memcpy() also adds the assumption that the source is at least that
long as well, which isn't assured, and isn't true in cases such as:

	set_task_comm(worker->task, "kworker/dying");

This leads to accessing invalid memory.
