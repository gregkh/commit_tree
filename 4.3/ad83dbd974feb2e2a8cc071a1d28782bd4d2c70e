staging: comedi: adl_pci7x3x: fix digital output on PCI-7230

The "adl_pci7x3x" driver replaced the "adl_pci7230" and "adl_pci7432"
drivers in commits 8f567c373c4b ("staging: comedi: new adl_pci7x3x
driver") and 657f77d173d3 ("staging: comedi: remove adl_pci7230 and
adl_pci7432 drivers").  Although the new driver code agrees with the
user manuals for the respective boards, digital outputs stopped working
on the PCI-7230.  This has 16 digital output channels and the previous
adl_pci7230 driver shifted the 16 bit output state left by 16 bits
before writing to the hardware register.  The new adl_pci7x3x driver
doesn't do that.  Fix it in `adl_pci7x3x_do_insn_bits()` by checking
for the special case of the subdevice having only 16 channels and
duplicating the 16 bit output state into both halves of the 32-bit
register.  That should work both for what the board actually does and
for what the user manual says it should do.
