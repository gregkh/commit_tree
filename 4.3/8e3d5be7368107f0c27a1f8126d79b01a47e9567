ipv6: Avoid double dst_free

It is a prep work to get dst freeing from fib tree undergo
a rcu grace period.

The following is a common paradigm:
if (ip6_del_rt(rt))
	dst_free(rt)

which means, if rt cannot be deleted from the fib tree, dst_free(rt) now.
1. We don't know the ip6_del_rt(rt) failure is because it
   was not managed by fib tree (e.g. DST_NOCACHE) or it had already been
   removed from the fib tree.
2. If rt had been managed by the fib tree, ip6_del_rt(rt) failure means
   dst_free(rt) has been called already.  A second
   dst_free(rt) is not always obviously safe.  The rt may have
   been destroyed already.
3. If rt is a DST_NOCACHE, dst_free(rt) should not be called.
4. It is a stopper to make dst freeing from fib tree undergo a
   rcu grace period.

This patch is to use a DST_NOCACHE flag to indicate a rt is
not managed by the fib tree.
