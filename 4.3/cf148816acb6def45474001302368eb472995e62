tipc: move received discovery data evaluation inside node.c

The node lock is currently grabbed and and released in the function
tipc_disc_rcv() in the file discover.c. As a preparation for the next
commits, we need to move this node lock handling, along with the code
area it is covering, to node.c.

This commit introduces this change.
