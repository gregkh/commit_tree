Staging: most: add MOST driver's aim-network module

This patch adds the aim-network module of the MOST driver to the kernel's
driver staging area. This module is part of the MOST driver and handles
user space interaction by means of network devices.

This patch is needed in order to have access to MOST Ethernet Packets (MEP)
through a networking device.
