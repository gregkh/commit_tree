pwm: kona: Modify settings application sequence

Update the driver so that settings are applied in accordance with the
most recent version of the hardware spec.  The revised sequence clears
the trigger bit, waits 400ns, writes settings, sets the trigger bit,
and waits another 400ns.  This corrects an issue where occasionally a
requested change was not properly reflected in the PWM output.
