Input: i8042 - add unmask_kbd_data option

A big problem with the current i8042 debugging option is that it outputs
data going to and from the keyboard by default. As a result, many dmesg
logs uploaded by users will unintentionally contain sensitive information
such as their password, as such it's probably a good idea not to output
data coming from the keyboard unless specifically enabled by the user.
