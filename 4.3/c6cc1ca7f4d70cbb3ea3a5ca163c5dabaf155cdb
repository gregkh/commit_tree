flowi: Abstract out functions to get flow hash based on flowi

Create __get_hash_from_flowi6 and __get_hash_from_flowi4 to get the
flow keys and hash based on flowi structures. These are called by
__skb_get_hash_flowi6 and __skb_get_hash_flowi4. Also, created
get_hash_from_flowi6 and get_hash_from_flowi4 which can be called
when just the hash value for a flowi is needed.
