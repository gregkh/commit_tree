ASoC: cht_bsw_max98090_ti: Use card DAPM context to access widgets

The dapm field of the snd_soc_codec struct will eventually be removed
(replaced with the DAPM context from the component embedded inside the
CODEC). Replace its usage with the card's DAPM context. The idea is that
DAPM is hierarchical and with the card at the root it is possible to access
widgets from other contexts through the card context.

While we are at it also remove some extra newlines.
