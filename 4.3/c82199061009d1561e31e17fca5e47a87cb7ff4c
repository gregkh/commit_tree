task_work: remove fifo ordering guarantee

In commit f341861fb0b ("task_work: add a scheduling point in
task_work_run()") I fixed a latency problem adding a cond_resched()
call.

Later, commit ac3d0da8f329 added yet another loop to reverse a list,
bringing back the latency spike :

I've seen in some cases this loop taking 275 ms, if for example a
process with 2,000,000 files is killed.

We could add yet another cond_resched() in the reverse loop, or we
can simply remove the reversal, as I do not think anything
would depend on order of task_work_add() submitted works.
