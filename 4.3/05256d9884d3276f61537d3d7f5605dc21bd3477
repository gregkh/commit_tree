md/raid5: strengthen check on reshape_position at run.

When reshaping, we work in units of the largest chunk size.
If changing from a larger to a smaller chunk size, that means we
reshape more than one stripe at a time.  So the required alignment
of reshape_position needs to take into account both the old
and new chunk size.

This means that both 'here_new' and 'here_old' are calculated with
respect to the same (maximum) chunk size, so testing if they are the
same when delta_disks is zero becomes pointless.
