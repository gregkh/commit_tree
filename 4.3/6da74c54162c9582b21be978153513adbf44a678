ARM: OMAP2+: Use pdata-quirks for wkup_m3 reset management

Use pdata-quirks to provide platform data required for reset
management during boot and shutdown of the wkup_m3 processor
on both the AM33xx and AM43xx SoCs. The WkupM3 remote processor
is used to implement and achieve low-power functionality on
the AM33xx & AM43xx SoCs.
