irqchip: Prepare for local stub header removal

The IRQCHIP_DECLARE macro moved to to 'include/linux/irqchip.h', so
the local irqchip.h became an empty shell, which solely includes
include/linux/irqchip.h

Include the global header in all irqchip drivers instead of the local
header, so we can remove it.
