tcp: generate CA_EVENT_TX_START on data frames

Issuing a CC TX_START event on control frames like pure ACK
is a waste of time, as a CC should not care.

Following patch needs this change, as we want CUBIC to properly track
idle time at a low cost, with a single TX_START being generated.

Yuchung might slightly refine the condition triggering TX_START
on a followup patch.
