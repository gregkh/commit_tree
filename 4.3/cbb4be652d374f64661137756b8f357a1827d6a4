USB: whiteheat: fix potential null-deref at probe

Fix potential null-pointer dereference at probe by making sure that the
required endpoints are present.

The whiteheat driver assumes there are at least five pairs of bulk
endpoints, of which the final pair is used for the "command port". An
attempt to bind to an interface with fewer bulk endpoints would
currently lead to an oops.

Fixes CVE-2015-5257.
