s390/numa: re-add DIE sched_domain_topology_level

By accident this level has been removed by the NUMA infrastructure patch.
For non-NUMA systems with CPUs that span more than one book, this makes
the scheduler only use one of the books and the other books remain idle.

Fix this and re-add the missing level.

For NUMA and non-NUMA we have the following scheduling domains and groups:

 - SMT  (Groups: CPU threads)
 - MC   (Groups: Cores)
 - BOOK (Groups: Books)

For the non-NUMA case we have one last level scheduling domain:

 - DIE  (Groups: Whole system, has all CPUs -> cpu_cpu_mask)

For the NUMA case we have the following two last level scheduling domains:

 - DIE  (Groups: NUMA nodes -> cpu_cpu_mask -> returns node siblings)
 - NUMA (Groups: Whole system, has all CPUs -> created in sched_init_numa())
