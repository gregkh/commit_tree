arm64: Fix pte_modify() to preserve the hardware dirty information

The pte_modify() function with hardware AF/DBM enabled must transfer the
hardware dirty information to the software PTE_DIRTY bit. However, it
was setting this bit in newprot and the mask does not cover such bit.
This patch sets PTE_DIRTY on the original pte which will be preserved in
the returned value.
