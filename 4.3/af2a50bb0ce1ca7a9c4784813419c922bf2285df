cxl: Fix + cleanup error paths in cxl_dev_context_init

If the cxl_context_alloc() call fails, we return immediately without
releasing the reference on the AFU device, allowing it to leak.

This patch switches to using goto style error handling so that the
device is released in common code for both error paths, and will also
simplify things if we add additional initialisation in this function in
the future.
