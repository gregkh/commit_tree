drm/i915: add dev_priv->mm.stolen_lock

Which should protect dev_priv->mm.stolen usage. This will allow us to
simplify the relationship between stolen memory, FBC and struct_mutex.

v2:
  - Rebase after the stolen_remove_node() dev_priv patch move.
  - I realized that after we fixed a few things related to the FBC CFB
    size checks, we're not reallocating the CFB anymore with FBC
    enabled, so we can just move all the locking to i915_gem_stolen.c
    and stop worrying about freezing all the stolen alocations while
    freeing/rellocating the CFB. This allows us to fix the "Too
    coarse" observation from Chris.
