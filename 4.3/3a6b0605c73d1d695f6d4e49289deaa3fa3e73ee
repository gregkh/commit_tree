Revert "[media] ARM: DT: STi: STiH407: Add c8sectpfe LinuxDVB DT node"

There are some missing dependencies at the DT, as it looks for
an I2C bus named "ssc2", but this is not defined.

Probably, it misses some dependencies from some other tree.
For now, revert this patch, to avoid build breakages.

This reverts commit 5d8877b6ae0d47897b821b8a11a2e8dee9a22686.
