kbuild: Fix .text.unlikely placement

When building a kernel with .text.unlikely text the unlikely text for
each translation unit was put next to the main .text code in the
final vmlinux.

The problem is that the linker doesn't allow more specific submatches
of a section name in a different linker script statement after the
main match.

So we need to move them all into one line. With that change
.text.unlikely is at the end of everything again.

I also moved .text.hot into the same statement though, even though
that's not strictly needed.
