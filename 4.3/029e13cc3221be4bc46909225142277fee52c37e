f2fs: adjust showing of extent cache stat

This patch alters to replace total hit stat with rbtree hit stat,
and then adjust showing of extent cache stat:

Hit Count:
L1-1: for largest node hit count;
L1-2: for last cached node hit count;
L2: for extent node hit after lookuping in rbtree.

Hit Ratio:
ratio (hit count / total lookup count)

Inner Struct Count:
tree count, node count.

Before:
Extent Hit Ratio: 0 / 2

Extent Tree Count: 3

Extent Node Count: 2

Patched:
Exten Cacache:
  - Hit Count: L1-1:4871 L1-2:2074 L2:208
  - Hit Ratio: 1% (7153 / 550751)
  - Inner Struct Count: tree: 26560, node: 11824
