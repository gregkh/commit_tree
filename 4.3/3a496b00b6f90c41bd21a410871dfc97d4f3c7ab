of/address: Don't loop forever in of_find_matching_node_by_address().

If the internal call to of_address_to_resource() fails, we end up
looping forever in of_find_matching_node_by_address().  This can be
caused by a defective device tree, or calling with an incorrect
matches argument.

Fix by calling of_find_matching_node() unconditionally at the end of
the loop.
