Drivers: hv: vmbus: remove hv_synic_free_cpu() call from hv_synic_cleanup()

We already have hv_synic_free() which frees all per-cpu pages for all
CPUs, let's remove the hv_synic_free_cpu() call from hv_synic_cleanup()
so it will be possible to do separate cleanup (writing to MSRs) and final
freeing. This is going to be used to assist kexec.
