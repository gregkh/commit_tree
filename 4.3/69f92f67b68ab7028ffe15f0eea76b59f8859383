drm/i915: Preserve SSC earlier

Commit 92122789b2d6 ("drm/i915: preserve SSC if previously set v3")
added code to intel_modeset_gem_init to override the SSC status read
from VBT with the SSC status set by BIOS.

However, intel_modeset_gem_init is invoked *after* intel_modeset_init,
which calls intel_setup_outputs, which *modifies* SSC status by way of
intel_init_pch_refclk. So unlike advertised, intel_modeset_gem_init
doesn't preserve the SSC status set by BIOS but whatever
intel_init_pch_refclk decided on.

This is a problem on dual gpu laptops such as the MacBook Pro which
require either a handler to switch DDC lines, or the discrete gpu
to proxy DDC/AUX communication: Both the handler and the discrete
gpu may initialize after the i915 driver, and consequently, an LVDS
connector may initially seem disconnected and the SSC therefore
is disabled by intel_init_pch_refclk, but on reprobe the connector
may turn out to be connected and the SSC must then be enabled.

Due to 92122789b2d6 however, the SSC is not enabled on reprobe since
it is assumed BIOS disabled it while in fact it was disabled by
intel_init_pch_refclk.

Also, because the SSC status is preserved so late, the preserved value
only ever gets used on resume but not on panel initialization:
intel_modeset_init calls intel_init_display which indirectly calls
intel_panel_use_ssc via multiple subroutines, *before* the BIOS value
overrides the VBT value in intel_modeset_gem_init (intel_panel_use_ssc
is the sole user of dev_priv->vbt.lvds_use_ssc).

Fix this by moving the code introduced by 92122789b2d6 from
intel_modeset_gem_init to intel_modeset_init before the invocation
of intel_setup_outputs and intel_init_display.

Add a DRM_DEBUG_KMS as suggested way back by Jani:
