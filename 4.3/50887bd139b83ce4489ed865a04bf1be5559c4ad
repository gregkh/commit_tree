dm: fix request-based dm error reporting

end_clone_bio() is a endio callback for clone bio and should check
and save the clone's bi_error for error reporting.  However,
4246a0b63bd8 ("block: add a bi_error field to struct bio") changed
the function to check the original bio's bi_error, which is 0.

Without this fix, clone's error is ignored and reported to the
original request as success.  Thus data corruption will be observed.
