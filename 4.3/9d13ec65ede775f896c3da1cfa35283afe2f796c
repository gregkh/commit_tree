tipc: introduce link entry structure to struct tipc_node

struct 'tipc_node' currently contains two arrays for link attributes,
one for the link pointers, and one for the usable link MTUs.

We now group those into a new struct 'tipc_link_entry', and intoduce
one single array consisting of such enties. Apart from being a cosmetic
improvement, this is a starting point for the strict master-slave
relation between node and link that we will introduce in the following
commits.
