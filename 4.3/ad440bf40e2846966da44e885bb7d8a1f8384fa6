PM / Domains: Remove unusable governor dummies

The governor dummies for the !CONFIG_PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS case are
unusable, as a governors is always referred to by taking its address,
which you can't do with a literal NULL pointer.

I.e.

	pm_genpd_init(genpd, &simple_qos_governor, false);

fails to compile with:

	error: lvalue required as unary '&' operand

Hence just remove the governor dummies.
