cxl: Fix lockdep warning while creating afu_err_buff attribute

Presently a lockdep warning is reported during creation of afu_err_buff
bin_attribute for the afu. This is caused due to the variable attr.key
not pointing to a static class key, hence the function lockdep_init_map
reports this warning:

 BUG: key <some-address> not in .data!

The patch fixes this issue by calling sysfs_attr_init on the
attr_eb.attr structure before populating it with the afu_err_buff file
details. This will populate the attr.key variable with a static class
key so that lockdep_init_map stops complaining about the lockdep key not
being static.
