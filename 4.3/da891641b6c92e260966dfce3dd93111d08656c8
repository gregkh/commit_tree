serial: 8250: Do XR17V35X specific wakeup in serial8250_do_startup

The XR17V35X UART needs the ECB bit set in its XR_EFR
register to enable access to IER [7:5], ISR [5:4], FCR[5:4],
MCR[7:5], and MSR [7:0].

Also reset the IER register to mask interrupts after access
to all bits of this register has been enabled.

This makes my 8-port XR17V35X working with the in-kernel
serial driver.
