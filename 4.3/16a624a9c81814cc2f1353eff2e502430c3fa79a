soc: mediatek: Add infracfg misc driver support

This adds support for some miscellaneous bits of the infracfg controller.
The mtk_infracfg_set/clear_bus_protection functions are necessary for
the scpsys power domain driver to handle the bus protection bits which
are contained in the infacfg register space.
