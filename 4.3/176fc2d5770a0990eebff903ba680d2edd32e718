regmap: debugfs: Don't bother actually printing when calculating max length

The in kernel snprintf() will conveniently return the actual length of
the printed string even if not given an output beffer at all so just do
that rather than relying on the user to pass in a suitable buffer,
ensuring that we don't need to worry if the buffer was truncated due to
the size of the buffer passed in.
