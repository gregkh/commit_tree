mpls: Enforce payload type of traffic sent using explicit NULL

RFC 4182 s2 states that if an IPv4 Explicit NULL label is the only
label on the stack, then after popping the resulting packet must be
treated as a IPv4 packet and forwarded based on the IPv4 header. The
same is true for IPv6 Explicit NULL with an IPv6 packet following.

Therefore, when installing the IPv4/IPv6 Explicit NULL label routes,
add an attribute that specifies the expected payload type for use at
forwarding time for determining the type of the encapsulated packet
instead of inspecting the first nibble of the packet.
