mm/slub: don't wait for high-order page allocation

Description is almost copied from commit fb05e7a89f50 ("net: don't wait
for order-3 page allocation").

I saw excessive direct memory reclaim/compaction triggered by slub.  This
causes performance issues and add latency.  Slub uses high-order
allocation to reduce internal fragmentation and management overhead.  But,
direct memory reclaim/compaction has high overhead and the benefit of
high-order allocation can't compensate the overhead of both work.

This patch makes auxiliary high-order allocation atomic.  If there is no
memory pressure and memory isn't fragmented, the alloction will still
success, so we don't sacrifice high-order allocation's benefit here.  If
the atomic allocation fails, direct memory reclaim/compaction will not be
triggered, allocation fallback to low-order immediately, hence the direct
memory reclaim/compaction overhead is avoided.  In the allocation failure
case, kswapd is waken up and trying to make high-order freepages, so
allocation could success next time.

Following is the test to measure effect of this patch.

System: QEMU, CPU 8, 512 MB
Mem: 25% memory is allocated at random position to make fragmentation.
 Memory-hogger occupies 150 MB memory.
Workload: hackbench -g 20 -l 1000

Average result by 10 runs (Base va Patched)

elapsed_time(s): 4.3468 vs 2.9838
compact_stall: 461.7 vs 73.6
pgmigrate_success: 28315.9 vs 7256.1
