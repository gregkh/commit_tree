IB/core: Add core header changes needed for OPA

This patch adds the value of the CNP opcode to the existing list of enumerated
opcodes in ib_pack.h

Add common OPA header definitions for driver
build:
- opa_port_info.h
- opa_smi.h
- hfi1_user.h

Additionally, ib_mad.h, has additional definitions
that are common to ib_drivers including:
- trap support
- cca support

The qib driver has the duplication removed in favor
those in ib_mad.h
