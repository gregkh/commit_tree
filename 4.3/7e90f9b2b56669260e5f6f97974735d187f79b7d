ASoC: wm8960: correct gain value for input PGA and add microphone PGA

The input PGAs have a gain range from -17.25dB to +30dB in 0.75dB steps.

The boost stage can provide additional gain. For line inputs, -12dB to
+6dB gain is available on the boost mixer. For micphone inputs, it can
provide up to +29dB additional gain from the microphone PGA.
