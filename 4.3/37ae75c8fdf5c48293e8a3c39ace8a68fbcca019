drm/bochs: Don't grab dev->struct_mutex for in mmap offset ioctl

Since David Herrmann's mmap vma manager rework we don't need to grab
dev->struct_mutex any more to prevent races when looking up the mmap
offset. Drop it and instead don't forget to use the unref_unlocked
variant (since the drm core still cares).
