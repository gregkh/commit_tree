cleanup IORESOURCE_CACHEABLE vs ioremap()

Quoting Arnd:
    I was thinking the opposite approach and basically removing all uses
    of IORESOURCE_CACHEABLE from the kernel. There are only a handful of
    them.and we can probably replace them all with hardcoded
    ioremap_cached() calls in the cases they are actually useful.

All existing usages of IORESOURCE_CACHEABLE call ioremap() instead of
ioremap_nocache() if the resource is cacheable, however ioremap() is
uncached by default. Clearly none of the existing usages care about the
cacheability. Particularly devm_ioremap_resource() never worked as
advertised since it always fell back to plain ioremap().

Clean this up as the new direction we want is to convert
ioremap_<type>() usages to memremap(..., flags).
