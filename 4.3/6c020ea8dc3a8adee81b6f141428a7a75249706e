arm64/Documentation: clarify wording regarding memory below the Image

Clarify that the memory below the start of the image but inside the
region covered by the linear mapping has no special significance to
the kernel, and may be used by the firmware provided that it is marked
as reserved.

Also, fix up some whitespace errors.
