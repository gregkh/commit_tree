ath10k: Add support for code swap

Code swap is a mechanism to use host memory to store
some fw binary code segment. Ath10k host driver allocates
and loads the code swap binary into the host memory and
configures the target with the host allocated memory
information at the address taken from code swap binary.
This patch adds code swap support for firmware binary.
Code swap binary for firmware bin is available in
ATH10K_FW_IE_FW_CODE_SWAP_IMAGE.
