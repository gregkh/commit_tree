gre: Remove support for sharing GRE protocol hook.

Support for sharing GREPROTO_CISCO port was added so that
OVS gre port and kernel GRE devices can co-exist. After
flow-based tunneling patches OVS GRE protocol processing
is completely moved to ip_gre module. so there is no need
for GRE protocol hook. Following patch consolidates
GRE protocol related functions into ip_gre module.
