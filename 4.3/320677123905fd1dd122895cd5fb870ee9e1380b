perf tools: Per-event time support

This patchkit adds the ability to turn off time stamps per event.

One usaful case for partial time is to work with per-event callgraph to
enable "PEBS threshold > 1" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/10/196), which
can significantly reduce the sampling overhead.

The event samples with time stamps off will not be ordered.
