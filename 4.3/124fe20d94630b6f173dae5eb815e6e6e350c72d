mm: enhance region_is_ram() to region_intersects()

region_is_ram() is used to prevent the establishment of aliased mappings
to physical "System RAM" with incompatible cache settings.  However, it
uses "-1" to indicate both "unknown" memory ranges (ranges not described
by platform firmware) and "mixed" ranges (where the parameters describe
a range that partially overlaps "System RAM").

Fix this up by explicitly tracking the "unknown" vs "mixed" resource
cases and returning REGION_INTERSECTS, REGION_MIXED, or REGION_DISJOINT.
This re-write also adds support for detecting when the requested region
completely eclipses all of a resource.  Note, the implementation treats
overlaps between "unknown" and the requested memory type as
REGION_INTERSECTS.

Finally, other memory types can be passed in by name, for now the only
usage "System RAM".
