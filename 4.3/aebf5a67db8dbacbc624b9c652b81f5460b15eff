dmaengine: pxa_dma: fix initial list move

Since the commit to have an allocated list of virtual descriptors was
reverted, the pxa_dma driver is broken, as it assumes the descriptor is
placed on the allocated list upon allocation.

Fix the issue in pxa_dma by making an allocated virtual descriptor a
singleton.
