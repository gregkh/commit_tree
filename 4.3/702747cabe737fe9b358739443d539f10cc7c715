blkcg: remove cfqg_stats->sectors

cfq_stats->sectors is a blkg_stat which keeps track of the total
number of sectors serviced; however, this can be trivially calculated
from blkcg_gq->stat_bytes.  The only thing necessary is adding up
READs and WRITEs and then dividing by sector size.

Remove cfqg_stats->sectors and make cfq print "sectors" and
"sectors_recursive" from stat_bytes.

While this is a bit more code, it removes duplicate stat allocations
and updates and ensures that the reported stats stay in tune with each
other.
