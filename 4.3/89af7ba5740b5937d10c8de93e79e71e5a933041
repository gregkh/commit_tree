cpu-hotplug: convert cpu_hotplug_disabled to a counter

As a prerequisite to exporting cpu_hotplug_enable/cpu_hotplug_disable
functions to modules we need to convert cpu_hotplug_disabled to a counter
to properly support disable -> disable -> enable call sequences. E.g.
after Hyper-V vmbus module (which is supposed to be the first user of
exported cpu_hotplug_enable/cpu_hotplug_disable) did cpu_hotplug_disable()
hibernate path calls disable_nonboot_cpus() and if we hit an error in
_cpu_down() enable_nonboot_cpus() will be called on the failure path (thus
making cpu_hotplug_disabled = 0 and leaving cpu hotplug in 'enabled'
state). Same problem is possible if more than 1 module use
cpu_hotplug_disable/cpu_hotplug_enable on their load/unload paths. When
one of these modules is been unloaded it is logical to leave cpu hotplug
in 'disabled' state.

To support the change we need to increse cpu_hotplug_disabled counter
in disable_nonboot_cpus() unconditionally as all users of
disable_nonboot_cpus() are supposed to do enable_nonboot_cpus() in case
an error was returned.
