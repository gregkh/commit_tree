ALSA: hda - Wake the codec up on pin/ELD notify events

Whenever there is an event from the i915 driver, wake the codec
and recheck plug/unplug + ELD status.

This fixes the issue with lost unsol events in power save mode,
the codec and controller can now sleep in D3 and still know when
the HDMI monitor has been connected.
