net: sched: drop all special handling of tx_queue_len == 0

Those were all workarounds for the formerly double meaning of
tx_queue_len, which broke scheduling algorithms if untreated.

Now that all in-tree drivers have been converted away from setting
tx_queue_len = 0, it should be safe to drop these workarounds for
categorically broken setups.
