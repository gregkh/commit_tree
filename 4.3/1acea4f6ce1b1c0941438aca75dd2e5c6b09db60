ppp: fix pppoe_dev deletion condition in pppoe_release()

We can't rely on PPPOX_ZOMBIE to decide whether to clear po->pppoe_dev.
PPPOX_ZOMBIE can be set by pppoe_disc_rcv() even when po->pppoe_dev is
NULL. So we have no guarantee that (sk->sk_state & PPPOX_ZOMBIE) implies
(po->pppoe_dev != NULL).
Since we're releasing a PPPoE socket, we want to release the pppoe_dev
if it exists and reset sk_state to PPPOX_DEAD, no matter the previous
value of sk_state. So we can just check for po->pppoe_dev and avoid any
assumption on sk->sk_state.
