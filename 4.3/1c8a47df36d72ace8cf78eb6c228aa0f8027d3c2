ovl: fix open in stacked overlay

If two overlayfs filesystems are stacked on top of each other, then we need
recursion in ovl_d_select_inode().

I guess d_backing_inode() is supposed to do that.  But currently it doesn't
and that functionality is open coded in vfs_open().  This is now copied
into ovl_d_select_inode() to fix this regression.
