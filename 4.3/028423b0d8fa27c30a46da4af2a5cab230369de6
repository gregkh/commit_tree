drm/amdgpu: fix 32-bit compiler warning

The new amdgpu driver passes a user space pointer in a 64-bit structure
member, which is the correct way to do it, but it attempts to
directly cast it to a __user pointer in the kernel, which causes
a warning in three places:

drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_cs.c: In function 'amdgpu_cs_parser_init':
drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_cs.c:180:21: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
  chunk_array_user = (uint64_t __user *)(cs->in.chunks);

This changes all three to add an intermediate cast to 'unsigned long'
as other drivers do. This avoids the warning and works correctly on
both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
