drm/radeon: Use new drm_fb_helper functions

Use the newly created wrapper drm_fb_helper functions instead of calling
core fbdev functions directly. They also simplify the fb_info creation.

v3:
- Don't touch remove_conflicting_framebuffers

v2:
- Fix build break because of missing include of drm_fb_helper in
  radeon_drv.c
