ext4: update c/mtime on truncate up

Commit 3da40c7b0898 ("ext4: only call ext4_truncate when size <= isize")
introduced a bug that c/mtime is not updated on truncate up.

Fix the issue by setting c/mtime explicitly in the truncate up case.

Note that ftruncate(2) is not affected, so you won't see this bug using
truncate(1) and xfs_io(1).
