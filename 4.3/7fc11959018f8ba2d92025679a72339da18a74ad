drm/amdgpu: stop using addr to check for BO move v3

It is theoretically possible that a swapped out BO gets the
same GTT address, but different backing pages while being swapped in.

Instead just use another VA state to note updated areas.
Ported from not upstream yet radeon commit with the same name.

v2: fix some bugs in the original implementation found in the radeon code.
v3: squash in VCE/UVD fix
