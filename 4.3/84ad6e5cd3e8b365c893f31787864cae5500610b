leds/powernv: Add driver for PowerNV platform

This patch implements LED driver for PowerNV platform using the existing
generic LED class framework.

PowerNV platform has below type of LEDs:
  - System attention
      Indicates there is a problem with the system that needs attention.
  - Identify
      Helps the user locate/identify a particular FRU or resource in the
      system.
  - Fault
      Indicates there is a problem with the FRU or resource at the
      location with which the indicator is associated.

We register classdev structures for all individual LEDs detected on the
system through LED specific device tree nodes. Device tree nodes specify
what all kind of LEDs present on the same location code. It registers
LED classdev structure for each of them.

All the system LEDs can be found in the same regular path /sys/class/leds/.
We don't use LED colors. We use LED node and led-types property to form
LED classdev. Our LEDs have names in this format.

        <location_code>:<attention|identify|fault>

Any positive brightness value would turn on the LED and a zero value would
turn off the LED. The driver will return LED_FULL (255) for any turned on
LED and LED_OFF (0) for any turned off LED.

The platform level implementation of LED get and set state has been
achieved through OPAL calls. These calls are made available for the
driver by exporting from architecture specific codes.
