NVMe: Fix memory leak on retried commands

Resources are reallocated for requeued commands, so unmap and release
the iod for the failed command.

It's a pretty bad memory leak and causes a kernel hang if you remove a
drive because of a busy dma pool. You'll get messages spewing like this:

  nvme 0000:xx:xx.x: dma_pool_destroy prp list 256, ffff880420dec000 busy

and lock up pci and the driver since removal never completes while
holding a lock.
