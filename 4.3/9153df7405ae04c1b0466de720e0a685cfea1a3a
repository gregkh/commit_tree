dm cache: fix leaking of deferred bio prison cells

There were two cases where dm_cell_visit_release() was being called,
which removes the cell from the prison's rbtree, but the callers didn't
also return the cell to the mempool.  Fix this by having them call
free_prison_cell().

This leak manifested as the 'kmalloc-96' slab growing until OOM.
