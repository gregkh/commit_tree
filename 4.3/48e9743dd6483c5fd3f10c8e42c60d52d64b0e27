i2c: core: add and export of_get_i2c_adapter_by_node() interface

of_find_i2c_adapter_by_node() call requires quite often missing
put_device(), and i2c_put_adapter() releases a device locked by
i2c_get_adapter() only. In general module_put(adapter->owner) and
put_device(dev) are not interchangeable.

This is a common error reproduction scenario as a result of the
misusage described above (for clearness this is run on iMX6 platform
with HDMI and I2C bus drivers compiled as kernel modules):

    root@mx6q:~# lsmod | grep i2c
    i2c_imx                10213  0
    root@mx6q:~# lsmod | grep dw_hdmi_imx
    dw_hdmi_imx             3631  0
    dw_hdmi                11846  1 dw_hdmi_imx
    imxdrm                  8674  3 dw_hdmi_imx,imx_ipuv3_crtc,imx_ldb
    drm_kms_helper        113765  5 dw_hdmi,imxdrm,imx_ipuv3_crtc,imx_ldb
    root@mx6q:~# rmmod dw_hdmi_imx
    root@mx6q:~# lsmod | grep i2c
    i2c_imx                10213  -1

                                 ^^^^^

    root@mx6q:~# rmmod i2c_imx
    rmmod: ERROR: Module i2c_imx is in use

To fix existing users of these interfaces and to avoid any further
confusion and misusage in future, add one more interface
of_get_i2c_adapter_by_node(), it is similar to i2c_get_adapter() in
sense that an I2C bus device driver found and locked by user can be
correctly unlocked by i2c_put_adapter().
