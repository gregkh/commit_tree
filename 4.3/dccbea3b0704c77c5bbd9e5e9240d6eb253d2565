drm/i915: calculate the port clock rate along with other PLL params

Depending on the platform the port clock fed to the pipe can be the PLL's
post-divided fast clock rate or a /5 divided version of it. To make this
more obvious across the platforms calculate this port clock along with
the rest of the PLL parameters.

This is also needed by the next patch where we can reuse the CHV helper
for the BXT PLL HW readout code; so export the corresponding helper.

While at it also add a more descriptive name to the helpers and a
comment explaining what's being calculated.

No functional change.
