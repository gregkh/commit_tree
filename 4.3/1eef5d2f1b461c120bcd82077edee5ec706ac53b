ARM: domains: switch to keeping domain value in register

Rather than modifying both the domain access control register and our
per-thread copy, modify only the domain access control register, and
use the per-thread copy to save and restore the register over context
switches.  We can also avoid the explicit initialisation of the
init thread_info structure.

This allows us to avoid needing to gain access to the thread information
at the uaccess control sites.
