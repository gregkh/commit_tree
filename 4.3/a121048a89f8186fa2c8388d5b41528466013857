batman-adv: prevent potential hlist double deletion

The hlist_del_rcu() call in batadv_tt_global_size_mod() does not check
if the element still is part of the list prior to deletion. The atomic
list counter should prevent the worst but converting to
hlist_del_init_rcu() ensures the element can't be deleted more than
once.
