writeback: update writeback tracepoints to report cgroup

The following tracepoints are updated to report the cgroup used during
cgroup writeback.

* writeback_write_inode[_start]
* writeback_queue
* writeback_exec
* writeback_start
* writeback_written
* writeback_wait
* writeback_nowork
* writeback_wake_background
* wbc_writepage
* writeback_queue_io
* bdi_dirty_ratelimit
* balance_dirty_pages
* writeback_sb_inodes_requeue
* writeback_single_inode[_start]

Note that writeback_bdi_register is separated out from writeback_class
as reporting cgroup doesn't make sense to it.  Tracepoints which take
bdi are updated to take bdi_writeback instead.
