hpsa: fix rmmod issues

The driver is calling hpsa_shutdown before calling scsi_remove_host.
hpsa_shutdown is disabling interrupts.

scsi_remove_host can trigger I/O operations, such as
SYNCHRONIZE CACHE when multipath is enabled which hang the system.

Call scsi_remove_host before calling hpsa_shutdown.
