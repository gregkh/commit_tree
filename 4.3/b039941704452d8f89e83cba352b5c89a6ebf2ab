ath10k: adjust default peer limits if qcache enabled in 10.4 fw

10.4 firmware supports upto 512 clients when qcache feature is enabled.
Make adjustment on default max peer count, active peers, number of tid in
such case to meet qcache requirement. 10.4 fw has extra unit info flag
NUM_UNITS_IS_NUM_ACTIVE_PEERS which is also handled in this patch.
