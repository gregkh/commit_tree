IB/core: lock client data with lists_rwsem

An ib_client callback that is called with the lists_rwsem locked only for
read is protected from changes to the IB client lists, but not from
ib_unregister_device() freeing its client data. This is because
ib_unregister_device() will remove the device from the device list with
lists_rwsem locked for write, but perform the rest of the cleanup,
including the call to remove() without that lock.

Mark client data that is undergoing de-registration with a new going_down
flag in the client data context. Lock the client data list with lists_rwsem
for write in addition to using the spinlock, so that functions calling the
callback would be able to lock only lists_rwsem for read and let callbacks
sleep.

Since ib_unregister_client() now marks the client data context, no need for
remove() to search the context again, so pass the client data directly to
remove() callbacks.
