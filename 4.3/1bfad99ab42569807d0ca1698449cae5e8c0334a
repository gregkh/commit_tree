hugetlbfs: hugetlb_vmtruncate_list() needs to take a range to delete

fallocate hole punch will want to unmap a specific range of pages.
Modify the existing hugetlb_vmtruncate_list() routine to take a
start/end range.  If end is 0, this indicates all pages after start
should be unmapped.  This is the same as the existing truncate
functionality.  Modify existing callers to add 0 as end of range.

Since the routine will be used in hole punch as well as truncate
operations, it is more appropriately renamed to hugetlb_vmdelete_list().
