arm64: alternative: put secondary CPUs into polling loop during patch

When patching the kernel text with alternatives, we may end up patching
parts of the stop_machine state machine (e.g. atomic_dec_and_test in
ack_state) and consequently corrupt the instruction stream of any
secondary CPUs.

This patch passes the cpu_online_mask to stop_machine, forcing all of
the CPUs into our own callback which can place the secondary cores into
a dumb (but safe!) polling loop whilst the patching is carried out.
