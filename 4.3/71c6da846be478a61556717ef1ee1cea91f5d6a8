crypto: ghash-clmulni: specify context size for ghash async algorithm

Currently context size (cra_ctxsize) doesn't specified for
ghash_async_alg. Which means it's zero. Thus crypto_create_tfm()
doesn't allocate needed space for ghash_async_ctx, so any
read/write to ctx (e.g. in ghash_async_init_tfm()) is not valid.
