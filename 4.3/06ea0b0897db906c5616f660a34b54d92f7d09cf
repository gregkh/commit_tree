drm/i915: Make intel_display_suspend atomic, v2.

Calculate all state using a normal transition, but afterwards fudge
crtc->state->active back to its old value. This should still allow
state restore in setup_hw_state to work properly.

Calling intel_set_mode will cause intel_display_set_init_power to be
called, make sure init_power gets set again afterwards.

Changes since v1:
- Fix to compile with v2 of the patch that adds intel_display_suspend.
- Add intel_display_set_init_power.
- Set return value to int to allow error checking.
