irqchip/bcm7120-l2: Perform suspend/resume even without installed child IRQs

Make use of the new irq_chip_generic suspend/resume callbacks.

This is required because if there are no installed child IRQs for this
chip, the irq_chip::irq_{suspend,resume} functions will not be called.
However, we still need to save/restore the forwarding mask, to enable
the top-level GIC interrupt; otherwise, we lose UART output after S3
resume.

In addition to refactoring the callbacks, we have to self-initialize the
mask cache, since the genirq core also doesn't initialize this until the
first child IRQ is installed.

The original problem report is described in extra detail here:
