thermal: power_allocator: relax the requirement of two passive trip points

The power allocator governor currently requires that the thermal zone
has at least two passive trip points.  If there aren't, the governor
refuses to bind to the thermal zone.

This commit relaxes that requirement.  Now the governor will bind to all
thermal zones regardless of how many trip points they have.
