mwifiex: add missing skb_push() in mwifiex_check_uap_capabilties

For PCIe/USB chipsets, preallocated skb buffers are reused for
event handling. mwifiex_check_uap_capabilties() performs
skb_pull(). This patch adds missing skb_push() to restore skb's
data pointer/length.

This bug was introduced by commit debfc6008169 ("mwifiex: update
AP WMM settings from BSS_START event")
