    drm: Check locking in drm_for_each_connector

I added locking checks to drm_for_each_connector but failed that
through drm_helper_connector_dpms -> drm_helper_choose_encoder_dpms
it's used in a few more places in the radeon resume/suspend code.

Fix them up.

Note that we could use the connector iterator macros in there too, but
that's for the future.
