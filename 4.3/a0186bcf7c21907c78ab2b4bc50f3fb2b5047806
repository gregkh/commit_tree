ACPI / sysfs: Add support to allow leading "\" missing in trace_method_name.

Since _SB.PCI0 can be used as relative path from root and can be easily
converted into internal trace_method_name format, we allow users to specify
trace_method_name using relative paths from root.
Note this is useful for grub2 for which users failed to pass "\" from the
grub configuration file.
