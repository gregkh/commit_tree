i40e/i40evf: RSS changes for X722

X722 uses the admin queue to configure RSS. This patch adds the necessary
flow changes to configure RSS through AQ. It also adds the separate VMDQ2
lookup tables and hash key programming for X722.

X722 also exposes a different set of PCTYPES for RSS, this patch
accommodates those changes.
