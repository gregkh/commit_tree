proc: export idle flag via kpageflags

As noted by Minchan, a benefit of reading idle flag from /proc/kpageflags
is that one can easily filter dirty and/or unevictable pages while
estimating the size of unused memory.

Note that idle flag read from /proc/kpageflags may be stale in case the
page was accessed via a PTE, because it would be too costly to iterate
over all page mappings on each /proc/kpageflags read to provide an
up-to-date value.  To make sure the flag is up-to-date one has to read
/sys/kernel/mm/page_idle/bitmap first.
