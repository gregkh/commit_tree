PM / sleep: Allow devices without runtime PM to do direct-complete

Don't unset the direct_complete flag on devices that have runtime PM
disabled, if they are runtime suspended.

This is needed because otherwise ancestor devices wouldn't be able to
do direct_complete without adding runtime PM support to all its
descendants.

Also removes pm_runtime_suspended_if_enabled() because it's now unused.
