powerpc/powernv: Add definition of OPAL_MSG_OCC message type

Add OPAL_MSG_OCC message definition to opal_message_type to receive
OCC events like reset, load and throttled. Host performance can be
affected when OCC is reset or OCC throttles the max Pstate.
We can register to opal_message_notifier to receive OPAL_MSG_OCC type
of message and report it to the userspace so as to keep the user
informed about the reason for a performance drop in workloads.

The reset and load OCC events are notified to kernel when FSP sends
OCC_RESET and OCC_LOAD commands.  Both reset and load messages are
sent to kernel on successful completion of reset and load operation
respectively.

The throttle OCC event indicates that the Pmax of the chip is reduced.
The chip_id and throttle reason for reducing Pmax is also queued along
with the message.
