ARM: dts: sun8i: Add support for USB controllers on A23/A33

A23/A33 has one pair of EHCI/OHCI USB controllers. There are 2 USB PHYs,
one for the USB OTG controller, one for the EHCI/OHCI pair. The latter
may also support HSIC, though none of the available boards utilize this,
so this is not supported yet.
