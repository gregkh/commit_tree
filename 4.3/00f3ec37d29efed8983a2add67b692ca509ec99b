clk: kill off set_irq_flags usage

set_irq_flags is ARM specific with custom flags which have genirq
equivalents. Convert drivers to use the genirq interfaces directly, so we
can kill off set_irq_flags. The translation of flags is as follows:

IRQF_VALID -> !IRQ_NOREQUEST
IRQF_PROBE -> !IRQ_NOPROBE
IRQF_NOAUTOEN -> IRQ_NOAUTOEN

For IRQs managed by an irqdomain, the irqdomain core code handles clearing
and setting IRQ_NOREQUEST already, so there is no need to do this in
.map() functions and we can simply remove the set_irq_flags calls. Some
users also modify IRQ_NOPROBE and this has been maintained although it
is not clear that is really needed. There appears to be a great deal of
blind copy and paste of this code.
