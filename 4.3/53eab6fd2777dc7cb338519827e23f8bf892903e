virtio-blk: use VIRTIO_BLK_F_WCE and VIRTIO_BLK_F_CONFIG_WCE in virtio1

VIRTIO_BLK_F_CONFIG_WCE is important in order to achieve good performance
(up to 2x, though more realistically +30-40%) in latency-bound workloads.
However, it was removed by mistake together with VIRTIO_BLK_F_FLUSH.

It will be restored in the next revision of the virtio 1.0 standard, so
do the same in Linux.
