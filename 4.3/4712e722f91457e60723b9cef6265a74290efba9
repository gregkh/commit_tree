fsnotify: get rid of fsnotify_destroy_mark_locked()

fsnotify_destroy_mark_locked() is subtle to use because it temporarily
releases group->mark_mutex.  To avoid future problems with this
function, split it into two.

fsnotify_detach_mark() is the part that needs group->mark_mutex and
fsnotify_free_mark() is the part that must be called outside of
group->mark_mutex.  This way it's much clearer what's going on and we
also avoid some pointless acquisitions of group->mark_mutex.
