btrfs: fix clone / extent-same deadlocks

Clone and extent same lock their source and target inodes in opposite order.
In addition to this, the range locking in clone doesn't take ordering into
account. Fix this by having clone use the same locking helpers as
btrfs-extent-same.

In addition, I do a small cleanup of the locking helpers, removing a case
(both inodes being the same) which was poorly accounted for and never
actually used by the callers.
