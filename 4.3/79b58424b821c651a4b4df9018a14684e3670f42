perf tools: Add Intel PT support for decoding MTC packets

MTC packets provide finer grain timestamp information than TSC packets.
MTC packets record time using the hardware crystal clock (CTC) which is
related to TSC packets using a TMA packet.

This patch just adds decoder support.

Support for a default value and validation of values is provided by a
later patch. Also documentation is updated in a separate patch.

For details refer to the June 2015 or later Intel 64 and IA-32
Architectures SDM Chapter 36 Intel Processor Trace.
