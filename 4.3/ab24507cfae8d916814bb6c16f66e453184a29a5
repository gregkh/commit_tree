xen: avoid another early crash of memory limited dom0

Commit b1c9f169047b ("xen: split counting of extra memory pages...")
introduced an error when dom0 was started with limited memory occurring
only on some hardware.

The problem arises in case dom0 is started with initial memory and
maximum memory being the same. The kernel must be configured without
CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG for the problem to happen. If all
of this is true and the E820 map of the machine is sparse (some areas
are not covered) then the machine might crash early in the boot
process.

An example E820 map triggering the problem looks like this:

In this case the area a0000-dffff isn't present in the map. This will
confuse the memory setup of the domain when remapping the memory from
such holes to populated areas.

To avoid the problem the accounting of to be remapped memory has to
count such holes in the E820 map as well.
