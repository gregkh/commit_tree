sched: Introduce the 'trace_sched_waking' tracepoint

Mathieu reported that since 317f394160e9 ("sched: Move the second half
of ttwu() to the remote cpu") trace_sched_wakeup() can happen out of
context of the waker.

This is a problem when you want to analyse wakeup paths because it is
now very hard to correlate the wakeup event to whoever issued the
wakeup.

OTOH trace_sched_wakeup() is issued at the point where we set
p->state = TASK_RUNNING, which is right were we hand the task off to
the scheduler, so this is an important point when looking at
scheduling behaviour, up to here its been the wakeup path everything
hereafter is due to scheduler policy.

To bridge this gap, introduce a second tracepoint: trace_sched_waking.
It is guaranteed to be called in the waker context.
