modsign: Allow password to be specified for signing key

We don't want this in the Kconfig since it might then get exposed in
/proc/config.gz. So make it a parameter to Kbuild instead. This also
means we don't have to jump through hoops to strip quotes from it, as
we would if it was a config option.
