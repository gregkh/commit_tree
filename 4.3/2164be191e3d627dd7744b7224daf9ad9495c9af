staging: unisys: Fix broken build when ARCH=um

When building with ARCH=um you get the following error:

arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h:252:42: error: 'REQUIRED_MASK0'
	undeclared

The Unisys drivers should not be compiled for UML, so this patch addresses
that by adding a dependency to kconfig for !UML.
