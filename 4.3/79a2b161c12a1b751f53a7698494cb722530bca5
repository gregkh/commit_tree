drm/dp: Define AUX_RETRY_INTERVAL as 500 us

Currently we react to native and i2c defers by waiting either 400-500 us
or 500-600 us, depending on which code path we take. Consolidate them
all to one define AUX_RETRY_INTERVAL which defines the minimum interval.
Since we've been using two different intervals pick the longer of them
and define AUX_RETRY_INTERVAL as 500 us. For the maximum just use
AUX_RETRY_INTERVAL+100 us.

I want to have a define for this so that I can use it when calculating
the estimated duration of i2c-over-aux transfers. Without a define it
would be very easy to change the sleep duration and neglect to update
the i2c-over-aux estimates.
