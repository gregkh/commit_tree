drm/nouveau/pm: allow the userspace to schedule hardware counters

This adds a new method NVIF_PERFCTR_V0_INIT which starts a batch of
hardware counters for sampling. This will allow the userspace to start
a monitoring session using the INIT method and to stop it with SAMPLE,
for example before and after a frame is rendered.

This commit temporarily breaks nv_perfmon but this is going to be fixed
with the upcoming patch.
