drm/radeon: Restore LCD backlight level on resume (>= R5xx)

Instead of only enabling the backlight (which seems to set it to max
brightness), just re-set the current backlight level, which also takes
care of enabling the backlight if necessary.

Only the radeon_atom_encoder_dpms_dig part tested on a Kaveri laptop,
the radeon_atom_encoder_dpms_avivo part is only compile tested.
