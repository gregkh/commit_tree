ALSA: fireworks/bebob/dice/oxfw: fix substreams counting at vmalloc failure

In PCM core, when hw_params() in each driver returns error, the state of
PCM substream is kept as 'open'. In this case, current drivers for sound
units on IEEE 1394 bus doesn't decrement substream counter in hw_free()
correctly. This causes these drivers to keep streams even if not
required.

This commit fixes this bug. When snd_pcm_lib_alloc_vmalloc_buffer()
fails, hw_params function in each driver returns without incrementing the
counter.
