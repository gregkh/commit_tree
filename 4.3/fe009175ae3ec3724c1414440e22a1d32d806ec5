backlight: lp855x: Use private data for regulator control

LP855x backlight device can be enabled by external VDD input. The
'supply' data is used for this purpose. It's kind of private data
which runs internally, so there is no reason to expose to the
platform data.

And devm_regulator_get() is moved from _parse_dt() to _probe().
Regulator consumer(lp855x) can control regulator not only from DT
but also from platform data configuration in a source file such
like board-*.c.
