mac80211: move ieee80211_get_bssid into RX file

This function is only used in the RX code, so moving it into
that file gives the compiler better optimisation possibilities
and also allows us to remove the check for short frames (which
in the RX path cannot happen, but as a generic utility needed
to be checked.)
