arm/xen: implement correctly pfn_to_mfn

After the commit introducing convertion between DMA and guest addresses,
all the callers of pfn_to_mfn are expecting to get a GFN (Guest Frame
Number). On ARM, all the guests are auto-translated so the GFN is equal
to the Linux PFN (Pseudo-physical Frame Number).

The current implementation may return an MFN if the caller is passing a
PFN associated to a mapped foreign grant. In pratice, I haven't seen
the problem on running guest but we should fix it for the sake of
correctness.

Correct the implementation by always returning the pfn passed in parameter.

A follow-up patch will take care to rename pfn_to_mfn to a suitable
name.
