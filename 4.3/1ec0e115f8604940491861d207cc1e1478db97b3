ARM: tegra: cpuidle: implement cpuidle_state.enter_freeze()

This callback is expected to do the same as enter() but it has to
guarantee that interrupts aren't enabled at any point in its execution,
as the tick is frozen.

It will be called when the system goes to suspend-to-idle and will
reduce power usage because CPUs won't be awaken for unnecessary IRQs.

By setting the CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP flag, we can reuse the same code
for both the enter() and enter_freeze() callbacks.
