genirq: Remove irq argument from irq flow handlers

Most interrupt flow handlers do not use the irq argument. Those few
which use it can retrieve the irq number from the irq descriptor.

Remove the argument.

Search and replace was done with coccinelle and some extra helper
scripts around it. Thanks to Julia for her help!
