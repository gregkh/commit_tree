xfs: Fix uninitialized return value in xfs_alloc_fix_freelist()

xfs_alloc_fix_freelist() can sometimes jump to out_agbp_relse
without ever setting value of 'error' variable which is then
returned. This can happen e.g. when pag->pagf_init is set but AG is
for metadata and we want to allocate user data.

Fix the problem by initializing 'error' to 0, which is the desired
return value when we decide to skip this group.
