xen: use correct type for HYPERVISOR_memory_op()

HYPERVISOR_memory_op() is defined to return an "int" value. This is
wrong, as the Xen hypervisor will return "long".

The sub-function XENMEM_maximum_reservation returns the maximum
number of pages for the current domain. An int will overflow for a
domain configured with 8TB of memory or more.

Correct this by using the correct type.
