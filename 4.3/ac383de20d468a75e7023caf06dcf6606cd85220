xfs: growfs not aware of sb_meta_uuid

Adding this simple change to xfstests:common/rc::_scratch_mkfs_xfs:

+       if [ $mkfs_status -eq 0 ]; then
+               xfs_admin -U generate $SCRATCH_DEV > /dev/null
+       fi

triggers all sorts of errors in xfstests. xfs/104 is an example,
where growfs fails with a UUID mismatch corruption detected by
xfs_agf_write_verify() when trying to write the first new AG
headers.

Fix this problem by making sure we copy the sb_meta_uuid into new
metadata written by growfs.
