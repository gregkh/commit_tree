mmc: core: Optimize case for exactly one erase-group budget

In the (not so unlikely) case that the mmc controller timeout budget is
enough for exactly one erase-group, the simplification of allowing one
sector has an enormous performance penalty. We optimize this special case
by introducing a flag that prohibits erase-group boundary crossing, so
that we can allow trimming more than one sector at a time.
