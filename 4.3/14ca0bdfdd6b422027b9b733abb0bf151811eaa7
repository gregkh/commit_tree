cpufreq: update user_policy.* on success

'user_policy' caches properties of a policy that are set by userspace.
And these must be updated only if cpufreq core was successful in
updating them based on request from user space.

In store_scaling_governor(), we are updating user_policy.policy and
user_policy.governor even if cpufreq_set_policy() failed. That's
incorrect.

Fix this by updating user_policy.* only if we were successful in
updating the properties.
