PM / OPP: Add helpers for initializing CPU OPPs

With "operating-points-v2" its possible to tell which devices share
OPPs. We already have infrastructure to decode that information.

This patch adds following APIs:
 - of_get_cpus_sharing_opps: Returns cpumask of CPUs sharing OPPs (only
   valid with v2 bindings).
 - of_cpumask_init_opp_table: Initializes OPPs for all CPUs present in
   cpumask.
 - of_cpumask_free_opp_table: Frees OPPs for all CPUs present in cpumask.

 - set_cpus_sharing_opps: Sets which CPUs share OPPs (only valid with old
   OPP bindings, as this information isn't present in DT).
