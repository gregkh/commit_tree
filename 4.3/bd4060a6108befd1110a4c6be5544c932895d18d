net: bcmgenet: Power on integrated GPHY in bcmgenet_power_up()

We are currently disabling the GPHY interface during bcmgenet_close(),
and attempting to power it back on during bcmgenet_open(). This works
fine for the first time, because we called bcmgenet_mii_config() which
took care of enabling the interface, however, bcmgenet_power_up() really
needs to power on the GPHY for correctness.

This will be particularly important as we want to move
bcmgenet_mii_probe() down to bcmgenet_open() to avoid seeing the "PHY
already attached" message.
