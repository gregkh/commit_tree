cpufreq: powernv: Handle throttling due to Pmax capping at chip level

The On-Chip-Controller(OCC) can throttle cpu frequency by reducing the
max allowed frequency for that chip if the chip exceeds its power or
temperature limits. As Pmax capping is a chip level condition report
this throttling behavior at chip level and also do not set the global
'throttled' on Pmax capping instead set the per-chip throttled
variable. Report unthrottling if Pmax is restored after throttling.

This patch adds a structure to store chip id and throttled state of
the chip.
