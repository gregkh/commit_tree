tipc: clean up definitions and usage of link flags

The status flag LINK_STOPPED is not needed any more, since the
mechanism for delayed deletion of links has been removed.
Likewise, LINK_STARTED and LINK_START_EVT are unnecessary,
because we can just as well start the link timer directly from
inside tipc_link_create().

We eliminate these flags in this commit.

Instead of the above flags, we now introduce three new link modes,
TIPC_LINK_OPEN, TIPC_LINK_BLOCKED and TIPC_LINK_TUNNEL. The values
indicate whether, and in the case of TIPC_LINK_TUNNEL, which, messages
the link is allowed to receive in this state. TIPC_LINK_BLOCKED also
blocks timer-driven protocol messages to be sent out, and any change
to the link FSM. Since the modes are mutually exclusive, we convert
them to state values, and rename the 'flags' field in struct tipc_link
to 'exec_mode'.

Finally, we move the #defines for link FSM states and events from link.h
into enums inside the file link.c, which is the real usage scope of
these definitions.
