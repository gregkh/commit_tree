perf evlist: Add has_user_cpus member

Subsequent patches will need to call perf_evlist__propagate_maps without
reference to a "target".  Add evlist->has_user_cpus to record whether
the user has specified which cpus to target (and therefore whether that
list of cpus should override the default settings for a selected event
i.e. the cpu maps should be propagated)
