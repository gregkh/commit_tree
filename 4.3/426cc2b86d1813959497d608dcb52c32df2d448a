tipc: introduce new link protocol msg create function

As a preparation for later changes, we introduce a new function
tipc_link_build_proto_msg(). Instead of actually sending the created
protocol message, it only creates it and adds it to the head of a
skb queue provided by the caller.

Since we still need the existing function tipc_link_protocol_xmit()
for a while, we redesign it to make use of the new function.
