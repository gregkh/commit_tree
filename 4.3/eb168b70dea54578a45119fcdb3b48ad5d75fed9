of: thermal: Fix inconsitency between cooling-*-state and cooling-*-level

The device trees in the kernel as well as the binding description in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/cpufreq/cpufreq-dt.txt use the
cooling-{min,max}-level property.

Fix the inconsistency with the binding description in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt by changing
cooling-*-state properties to cooling-*-level.
