ACPICA: Cleanup use of all non-ANSI local C library functions

ACPICA commit 7c490c28a18b435c543c6b410e7e7c2131fccc78

ACPICA implements all non-ANSI functions locally. However, there
are sometimes two or more versions of the same function throughout
the ACPICA code. This change fixes this.

Adds a new file, utilities/utnonansi.c
