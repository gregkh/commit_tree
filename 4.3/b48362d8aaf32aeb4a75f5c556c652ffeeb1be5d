hrtimer: Unconfuse switch_hrtimer_base() a bit

The variable called "this_base" is confusing because its name suggests
it's of "struct hrtimer_clock_base" type, along with "base" and "new_base"
which doesn't help understanding this complicated function.

Make its name clearer and fix the misleading comment while at it.
