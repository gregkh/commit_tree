mfd: arizona: Fixup register table definitions

The regmap register definitions have been a source of many small fixes
as issues are discovered.  As such I made a small automated tool to
check these definitions. This patch fixes the issues (mostly harmless)
located by that tool, the issues fall into three catagories:

1) Volatile registers that have a default in the defaults table (default
has been removed from the table since it is redundant)
2) Registers that are marked as volatile but unreadable (register has
been removed from the volatile list since it is obviously not being
used)
3) Registers that arn't readable but have an entry in the defaults
table (again removed since it is redundant)
4) Readable non-volatile registers that are missing a default, these are
dangerous as they won't get synced during a cache sync. Fortunately,
most of them seem to be registers that shouldn't be there (for example
wm5102 had readable registers for DRC2 and ISRC3 which is doesn't have)

Hopefully another tool will be produced to check the actual default
values themselves but that is outside the scope of this patch.
