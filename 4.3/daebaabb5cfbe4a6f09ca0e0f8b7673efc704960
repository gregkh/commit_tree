powerpc/pseries: Release DRC when configure_connector fails

Commit f32393c943e2 ("powerpc/pseries: Correct cpu affinity for
dlpar added cpus") moved dlpar_acquire_drc() call to before
dlpar_configure_connector() call in dlpar_cpu_probe(), but missed
to release the DRC if dlpar_configure_connector() failed.
During CPU hotplug, if configure-connector fails for any reason,
then this will result in subsequent CPU hotplug attempts to fail.

Release the acquired DRC if dlpar_configure_connector() call fails
so that the DRC is left in right isolation and allocation state
for the subsequent hotplug operation to succeed.
