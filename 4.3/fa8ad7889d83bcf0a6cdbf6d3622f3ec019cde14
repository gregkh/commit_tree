arm: perf: factor arm_pmu core out to drivers

To enable sharing of the arm_pmu code with arm64, this patch factors it
out to drivers/perf/. A new drivers/perf directory is added for
performance monitor drivers to live under.

MAINTAINERS is updated accordingly. Files added previously without a
corresponsing MAINTAINERS update (perf_regs.c, perf_callchain.c, and
perf_event.h) are also added.
