mac80211: mesh: separate plid and aid concepts

According to 802.11-2012 13.3.1, a mesh STA should assign an AID
upon receipt of a mesh peering open frame rather than using the link
id of the peer.  Using the peer link id has two potential issues:
it may not be unique among the peers, and by its nature it is random,
so the TIM may not compress well.

In preparation for allocating it properly, use sta->sta.aid, but keep
the existing behavior of using the plid in the aid we send.
