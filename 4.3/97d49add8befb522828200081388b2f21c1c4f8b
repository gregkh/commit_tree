serial: samsung: Remove redundant DEBUG_LL check

Commit 84f57d9e3685 ("tty: serial/samsung: fix modular build") fixed
build issues when the driver was built as a module. One of those was
that printascii is only accessible when the driver is built-in.

But there is no need to check for defined(CONFIG_DEBUG_LL) since the
SERIAL_SAMSUNG_DEBUG Kconfig symbol already depends on DEBUG_LL.
