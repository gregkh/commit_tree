md/raid5: split bio for chunk_aligned_read

If a read request fits entirely in a chunk, it will be passed directly to the
underlying device (providing it hasn't failed of course).  If it doesn't fit,
the slightly less efficient path that uses the stripe_cache is used.
Requests that get to the stripe cache are always completely split up as
necessary.

So with RAID5, ripping out the merge_bvec_fn doesn't cause it to stop work,
but could cause it to take the less efficient path more often.

All that is needed to manage this is for 'chunk_aligned_read' do some bio
splitting, much like the RAID0 code does.
