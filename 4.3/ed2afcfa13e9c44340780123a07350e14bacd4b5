KVM: s390: remove "from (user|kernel)" from irq injection messages

The "from user"/"from kernel" part of the log/trace messages is not
always correct anymore and therefore not really helpful.

Let's remove that part from the log + trace messages. For program
interrupts, we can now move the logging/tracing part into the real
injection function, as already done for the other injection functions.
