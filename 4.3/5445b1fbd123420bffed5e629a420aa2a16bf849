NFSv4: Respect the server imposed limit on how many changes we may cache

The NFSv4 delegation spec allows the server to tell a client to limit how
much data it cache after the file is closed. In return, the server
guarantees enough free space to avoid ENOSPC situations, etc.
Prior to this patch, we assumed we could always cache aggressively after
close. Unfortunately, this causes problems with servers that set the
limit to 0 and therefore do not offer any ENOSPC guarantees.
