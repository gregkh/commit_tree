arm64: mm: mark create_mapping as __init

Currently create_mapping is marked with __ref, apparently because it
refers to early_alloc. However, create_mapping has no logic to prevent
erroneous use of early_alloc after it has been freed, and is only ever
called by __init functions anyway. Thus the __ref marker is misleading
and unnecessary.

Instead, this patch marks create_mapping as __init, resulting in
warnings if it is used from a a non __init functions, and allowing its
memory to be reclaimed.
