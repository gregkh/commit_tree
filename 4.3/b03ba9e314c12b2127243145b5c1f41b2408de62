spi: img-spfi: fix multiple calls to request gpio

spfi_setup may be called many times by the spi framework, but
gpio_request_one can only be called once without freeing, repeatedly
calling gpio_request_one will cause an error to be thrown, which
causes the request to spi_setup to be marked as failed.

We can have a per-spi_device flag that indicates whether or not the
gpio has been requested. If the gpio has already been requested use
gpio_direction_output to set the direction of the gpio.
