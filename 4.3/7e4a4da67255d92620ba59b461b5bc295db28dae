USB: bcma: remove chip id check

I have never seen any bcma device with an USB host core which was not a
SoC, the bcma devices have an USB device core with a different core id.
Some SoC have IDs with 47XX and 53XX in decimal form which would be
rejected by this check. Instead of fixing this check just remove it.
