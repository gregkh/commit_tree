IB/ipoib: Suppress warning for send only join failures

We expect send only joins to fail, it just means there are no listeners
for the group. The correct thing to do is silently drop the packet
at source.

Eg avahi will full join 224.0.0.251 which causes a send only IGMP packet
to 224.0.0.22, and then a warning level kmessage like this:

 ib0: sendonly multicast join failed for ff12:401b:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0016, status -22

If there is no IP router listening to IGMP.
