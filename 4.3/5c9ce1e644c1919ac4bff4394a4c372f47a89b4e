perf ordered_events: Clear the progress bar at the end of a flush

We were depending on the next screen operation after a flush() being
one that would redraw the whole screen so that the progress bar would
be overwritten, when that didn't happen a screen artifact of, say, a
error dialog window would be overlaid on top of the progress bar, fix
it by calling ui_browser__finish(), that now has a TUI implementation.
