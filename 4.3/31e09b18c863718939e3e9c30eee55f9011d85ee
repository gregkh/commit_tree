x86/mm/srat: Print non-volatile flag in SRAT

With the addition of NVDIMM support, a question came up as to
whether NVDIMM ranges should be in the SRAT with this bit set.
I think the consensus was no because the ranges are in the NFIT
with proximity domain information there.

ACPI is not clear on the meaning of this bit in the SRAT.
If someone is setting it, we might want to ask them what they
expect to happen with it.

Right now this bit is only printed if all the ACPI debug
information is turned on.
