rcu: Rename RCU_GP_DONE_FQS to RCU_GP_DOING_FQS

The grace-period kthread sleeps waiting to do a force-quiescent-state
scan, and when awakened sets rsp->gp_state to RCU_GP_DONE_FQS.
However, this is confusing because the kthread has not done the
force-quiescent-state, but is instead just starting to do it.  This commit
therefore renames RCU_GP_DONE_FQS to RCU_GP_DOING_FQS in order to make
things a bit easier on reviewers.
