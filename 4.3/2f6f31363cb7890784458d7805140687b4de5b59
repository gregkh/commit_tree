MIPS: cpu-features: Add cpu_has_ftlb

Add cpu_has_ftlb, which specifies that an FTLB is present in addition to
the VTLB, probed based on whether Config.MT == 4 (rather than 1 for
standard JTLB).

This is necessary since MIPS release 6 removes Config4.MMUExtDef, so the
presence of the FTLB fields in Config4 must be determined from Config.MT
instead.
