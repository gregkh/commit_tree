toshiba_acpi: Avoid registering input device on WMI event laptops

Commit f11f999e9890 ("toshiba_acpi: Refuse to load on machines with
buggy INFO implementations") denied loading on laptops with a WMI Event
GUID given that such laptops manage the hotkeys via that interface,
however, such laptops have a working Toshiba Configuration Interface
(TCI), and thus, such commit denied several supported features.

This patch avoids registering the input device and ignores all hotkey
events on laptops with such WMI Event GUID, making the supported
features found in those laptops to work.
