HID: wacom: Remove WACOM_QUIRK_NO_INPUT

WACOM_QUIRK_NO_INPUT is a signal to the driver that input devices
should not be created for a particular device. This quirk was used by
the wireless receiver to prevent any devices from being created during
the initial probe (defering it instead until we got a tablet connection
event in 'wacom_wireless_work').

This quirk is not necessary now that a device_type is associated with each
device. Any input device allocated by 'wacom_allocate_inputs' which is
not necessary for a particular device is freed in 'wacom_register_inputs'.
In particular, none of the wireless receivers devices have the pen, pad,
or touch device types set so the same effect is achieved without the need
to be explicit.

We now return early in wacom_retrieve_hid_descriptor for wireless devices
(to prevent the device_type from being overridden) but since we ignore the
HID descriptor for the wireless reciever anyway, this is not an issue.
