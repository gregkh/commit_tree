MIPS: Add default case for the FTLB enable/disable code

Add a default case for the FTLB enable/disable code. This will be used
to detect that something went wrong in the set_ftlb_enable() function
either because that function knows nothing about the running core, or
simply because the core can't turn its FTLB on/off.
