ath10k: txrx: remove unreachable negative return check and fixup type

wait_event_timeout(), introduced in 'commit 5e3dd157d7e7 ("ath10k: mac80211
driver for Qualcomm Atheros 802.11ac CQA98xx devices")' never returns < 0
so the only failure condition to be checked is == 0 (timeout). Further the
return type is long not int - an appropriately named variable is added
and the assignments fixed up.
