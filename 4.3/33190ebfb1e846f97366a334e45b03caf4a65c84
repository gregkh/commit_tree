wil6210: restart AP upon change in privacy settings

privacy settings might change while AP is running.
Inside wil_cfg80211_change_beacon(), detect change
in privacy settings and handle it by stopping and
re-starting the AP.
Firmware cannot handle on-the-fly privacy settings
change and so AP restart is required.
