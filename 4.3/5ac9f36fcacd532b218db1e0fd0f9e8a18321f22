f2fs: fix to record dirty page count for symlink

Dirty page can be exist in mapping of newly created symlink, but previously
we did not maintain the counting of dirty page for symlink like we maintained
for regular/directory, so the counting we lookuped should be wrong.

This patch adds missed dirty page counting for symlink to fix this issue.
