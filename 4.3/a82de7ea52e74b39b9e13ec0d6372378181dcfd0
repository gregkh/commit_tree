staging/lustre/lnet: Move asm/irq.h include after linux includes

Apparently m86k cannot build if you include asm/irq.h before
linux/* includes and fixing it there is hard.
So just move asm/irq.h include to where it does not cause any problems.

Thanks to Geert Uytterhoeven for getting to the root of it.
