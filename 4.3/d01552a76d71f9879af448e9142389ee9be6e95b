Revert "md: allow a partially recovered device to be hot-added to an array."

This reverts commit 7eb418851f3278de67126ea0c427641ab4792c57.

This commit is poorly justified, I can find not discusison in email,
and it clearly causes a problem.

If a device which is being recovered fails and is subsequently
re-added to an array, there could easily have been changes to the
array *before* the point where the recovery was up to.  So the
recovery must start again from the beginning.

If a spare is being recovered and fails, then when it is re-added we
really should do a bitmap-based recovery up to the recovery-offset,
and then a full recovery from there.  Before this reversion, we only
did the "full recovery from there" which is not corect.  After this
reversion with will do a full recovery from the start, which is safer
but not ideal.

It will be left to a future patch to arrange the two different styles
of recovery.
