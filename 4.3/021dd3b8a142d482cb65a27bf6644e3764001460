net: Add routes to the table associated with the device

When a device associated with a VRF is brought up or down routes
should be added to/removed from the table associated with the VRF.
fib_magic defaults to using the main or local tables. Have it use
the table with the device if there is one.

A part of this is directing prefsrc validations to the correct
table as well.
