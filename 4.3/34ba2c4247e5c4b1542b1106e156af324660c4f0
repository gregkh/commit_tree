arm64: set MAX_MEMBLOCK_ADDR according to linear region size

The linear region size of a 39-bit VA kernel is only 256 GB, which
may be insufficient to cover all of system RAM, even on platforms
that have much less than 256 GB of memory but which is laid out
very sparsely.

So make sure we clip the memory we will not be able to map before
installing it into the memblock memory table, by setting
MAX_MEMBLOCK_ADDR accordingly.
