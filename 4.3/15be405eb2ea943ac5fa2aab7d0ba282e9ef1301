net: Add inet_addr lookup by table

Currently inet_addr_type and inet_dev_addr_type expect local addresses
to be in the local table. With the VRF device local routes for devices
associated with a VRF will be in the table associated with the VRF.
Provide an alternate inet_addr lookup to use a specific table rather
than defaulting to the local table.
