userns,pidns: Force thread group sharing, not signal handler sharing.

The code that places signals in signal queues computes the uids, gids,
and pids at the time the signals are enqueued.  Which means that tasks
that share signal queues must be in the same pid and user namespaces.

Sharing signal handlers is fine, but bizarre.

So make the code in fork and userns_install clearer by only testing
for what is functionally necessary.

Also update the comment in unshare about unsharing a user namespace to
be a little more explicit and make a little more sense.
