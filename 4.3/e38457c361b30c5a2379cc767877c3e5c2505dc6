arm64: efi: prefer AllocatePages() over efi_low_alloc() for vmlinux

When allocating memory for the kernel image, try the AllocatePages()
boot service to obtain memory at the preferred offset of
'dram_base + TEXT_OFFSET', and only revert to efi_low_alloc() if that
fails. This is the only way to allocate at the base of DRAM if DRAM
starts at 0x0, since efi_low_alloc() refuses to allocate at 0x0.
