ALSA: usb-audio: Recurse before saving terminal properties

The input terminal parser recurses into the referenced clock entity to verify
it is existant and thus the terminal descriptor is valid. The actual property
values of the term instance which is initially parsed must not be overriden by
the recursion. For this to work the term properties have to be assigned after
recursing into the referenced clock entity descriptors.
