usb: gadget: goku_udc: add goku_match_ep() function

Add 'match_ep' callback to utilize chip-specific knowledge in endpoint matching
process. Function does the same that was done by chip-specific code inside
of epautoconf. Now this code can be removed from there to separate generic code
from platform specific logic.
