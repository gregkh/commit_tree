Coresight: Add an interface for supporting ETM3/4 Context ID tracing

If PID namespace is enabled, everytime users configure the Context ID
register to trace the specific process, there needs to be a translation
between the real PID seen from the kernel and VPID seen from the
namespace in which the user's process resides .

This patch just adds the translation interface for ETMs.
