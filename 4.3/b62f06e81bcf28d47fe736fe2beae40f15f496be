bpf tools: Collect relocation sections from SHT_REL sections

This patch collects relocation sections into 'struct object'.  Such
sections are used for connecting maps to bpf programs. 'reloc' field in
'struct bpf_object' is introduced for storing such information.

This patch simply store the data into 'reloc' field. Following patch
will parse them to know the exact instructions which are needed to be
relocated.

Note that the collected data will be invalid after ELF object file is
closed.

This is the second patch related to map relocation. The first one is
'bpf tools: Collect symbol table from SHT_SYMTAB section'. The
principle of map relocation is described in its commit message.
