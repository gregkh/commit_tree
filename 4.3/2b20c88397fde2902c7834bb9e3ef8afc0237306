i40e: Remove redundant and unneeded messages

The kernel notifies all VXLAN capable registered drivers, i.e. any
driver that implements ndo_add_vxlan_port(), of the addition of a
port so that the driver can track which ports are in use.  There's
no need to log this - it just fills the system log with useless and
irksome noise.

Also, when failing to init SR-IOV interfaces the driver was printing the
same message twice. Just remove the inner printk and let the outer message
catch enable as well as the other failures.
