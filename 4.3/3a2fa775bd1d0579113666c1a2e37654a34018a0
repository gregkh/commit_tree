ARM: dts: omap3-beagle: make i2c3, ddc and tfp410 gpio work again

Let's fix pinmux address of gpio 170 used by tfp410 powerdown-gpio.

According to the OMAP35x Technical Reference Manual
  CONTROL_PADCONF_I2C3_SDA[15:0]  0x480021C4 mode0: i2c3_sda
  CONTROL_PADCONF_I2C3_SDA[31:16] 0x480021C4 mode4: gpio_170
the pinmux address of gpio 170 must be 0x480021C6.

The former wrong address broke i2c3 (used by hdmi ddc), resulting in
kernel message:
  omap_i2c 48060000.i2c: controller timed out
