perf script: Switch from perf.data's kallsyms to perf's symbol resolver

We were storing a copy of kallsyms inside perf.data file so that we
could resolve kernel addresses to function (start, name, mod) tuples,
but that can be achieved using the symbol resolving routines we have
in symbols.c, and that are used elsewhere in tools/perf.

So, do just like 'perf trace' did and ask libtraceevent to use perf's
symbol resolution routines.

The next step is to just skip whatever kallsyms data is embedded in
older perf.data files and finally to stop storing kallsyms in the perf
data file, as the 20-bytes build-id stored in perf.data's header is
enough to find out the right symtab (be it ELF, kcore, kallsyms, etc) to
use.
