KEYS: Fix race between key destruction and finding a keyring by name

There appears to be a race between:

 (1) key_gc_unused_keys() which frees key->security and then calls
     keyring_destroy() to unlink the name from the name list

 (2) find_keyring_by_name() which calls key_permission(), thus accessing
     key->security, on a key before checking to see whether the key usage is 0
     (ie. the key is dead and might be cleaned up).

Fix this by calling ->destroy() before cleaning up the core key data -
including key->security.
