s390/nmi: initialize control register 0 earlier

Change machine_check_init() to an early_initcall(). This makes sure it will
be called before all other cpus are online and therfore saves us a lot of
pointless smp_call_function() calls.
The control register settings will be forwarded to the other cpus when they
will be brought online.
