perf/x86: Add a native_perf_sched_clock_from_tsc()

PEBSv3 has a raw TSC time stamp in its memory buffer that
later needs to to be converted to perf_clock.

Add a native_sched_clock_from_tsc() that works the same
as native_sched_clock(), but starts with an already given
TSC value.

Paravirt is ignored, it will just get the native clock.
But there isn't a para virtualized PEBS anyway.
