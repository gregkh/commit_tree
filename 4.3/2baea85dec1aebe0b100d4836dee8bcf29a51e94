Bluetooth: L2CAP ERTM shutdown protect sk and chan

During execution of l2cap_sock_shutdown() which might
sleep, the sk and chan structures can be in an unlocked
condition which potentially allows the structures to be
freed by other running threads. Therefore, there is a
possibility of a malfunction or memory reuse after being
freed.

Keep the sk and chan structures alive during the
execution of l2cap_sock_shutdown() by using their
respective hold and put functions. This allows the structures
to be freeable at the end of l2cap_sock_shutdown().
