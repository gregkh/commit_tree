serial: 8250_omap: refactor mdr1 update

The silicon errata[1] workaround implemented in a follow-on
patch, "serial: 8250_omap: workaround errata on disabling
UART after using DMA", requires MDR1 register programming.

Extract MDR1 register update into helper function,
omap8250_update_mdr1() to help with that.
