iio: Add inverse unit conversion macros

Add inverse unit conversion macro to convert from standard IIO units to
units that might be used by some devices.

Those are useful in combination with scale factors that are specified as
IIO_VAL_FRACTIONAL. Typically the denominator for those specifications will
contain the maximum raw value the sensor will generate and the numerator
the value it maps to in a specific unit. Sometimes datasheets specify those
in different units than the standard IIO units (e.g. degree/s instead of
rad/s) and so we need to do a unit conversion.

From a mathematical point of view it does not make a difference whether we
apply the unit conversion to the numerator or the inverse unit conversion
to the denominator since (x / y) / z = x / (y * z). But as the denominator
is typically a larger value and we are rounding both the numerator and
denominator to integer values using the later method gives us a better
precision (E.g. the relative error is smaller if we round 8000.3 to 8000
rather than rounding 8.3 to 8).

This is where in inverse unit conversion macros will be used.

Marked for stable as used by some upcoming fixes.
