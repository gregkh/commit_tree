dm-mpath, scsi_dh: don't let dm detach device handlers

While allowing dm-mpath to attach device handlers is a functionality we need
for backwards compatibility reason there is no reason to reference count
them and detach them if dm-mpath stops using the device for some reason.

If the device handler works for the given device it can just stay attached,
and we can take the retain_hw_handler codepath.
