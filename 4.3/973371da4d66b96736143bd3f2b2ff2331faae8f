i40evf: Allow for an abundance of vectors

The driver currently only maps TX and RX queues to a single MSI-X vector
per queue pair if there are exactly enough vectors for this.
Unfortunately, if we have too many vectors it will fail and allocate
queues to vectors in a suboptimal manner. Change the condition check to
allow for excess vectors. In this case, the extras just won't be used.
