drm/i915: Drop port_mst_index parameter from pin/eld callback

The port_mst_index parameter was reserved for future use, but
maintainers prefer to add it later when it is actually used.

[Note: this is an update patch to commit [51e1d83cab99: drm/i915: Call
 audio pin/ELD notify function] where I mistakenly applied the older
 version.  Jani and Daniel's review tags were to the latest version,
 so I add them below, too -- tiwai]
