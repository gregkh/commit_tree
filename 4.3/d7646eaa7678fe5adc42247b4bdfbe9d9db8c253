Drivers: hv: don't do hypercalls when hypercall_page is NULL

At the very late stage of kexec a driver (which are not being unloaded) can
try to post a message or signal an event. This will crash the kernel as we
already did hv_cleanup() and the hypercall page is NULL.

Move all common (between 32 and 64 bit code) declarations to the beginning
of the do_hypercall() function. Unfortunately we have to write the
!hypercall_page check twice to not mix declarations and code.
