ARM: pxa: ssp: Fix build error by removing originally incorrect DT binding

Commit 03fbf488cece ("spi: pxa2xx: Differentiate Intel LPSS types") caused
build error here because it removed the type LPSS_SSP and I didn't notice
the type was used here too.

I believe commit a6e56c28a178 ("ARM: pxa: ssp: add DT bindings") added it
accidentally by copying all enum pxa_ssp_type types from
include/linux/pxa2xx_ssp.h even LPSS_SSP was for Intel LPSS SPI devices.

Fix the build error by removing this incorrect binding.
