drm/i915: Update i915_switch_context() to take a request structure

Now that the request is guaranteed to specify the context, it is possible to
update the context switch code to use requests rather than ring and context
pairs. This patch updates i915_switch_context() accordingly.

Also removed the warning that the request's context must match the last context
switch's context. As the context switch now gets the context object from the
request structure, there is no longer any scope for the two to become out of
step.
