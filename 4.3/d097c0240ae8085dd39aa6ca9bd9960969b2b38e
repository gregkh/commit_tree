kmod: remove unecessary explicit wide CPU affinity setting

Khelper is affine to all CPUs.  Now since it creates the
call_usermodehelper_exec_[a]sync() kernel threads, those inherit the wide
affinity.

As such explicitly forcing a wide affinity from those kernel threads
is like a no-op.

Just remove it. It's needless and it breaks CPU isolation users who
rely on workqueue affinity tuning.
