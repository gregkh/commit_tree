nohz: Restart nohz full tick from irq exit

Restart the tick when necessary from the irq exit path. It makes nohz
full more flexible, simplify the related IPIs and doesn't bring
significant overhead on irq exit.

In a longer term view, it will allow us to piggyback the nohz kick
on the scheduler IPI in the future instead of sending a dedicated IPI
that often doubles the scheduler IPI on task wakeup. This will require
more changes though including careful review of resched_curr() callers
to include nohz full needs.
