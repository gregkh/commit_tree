netfilter: xtables: compute exact size needed for jumpstack

The {arp,ip,ip6tables} jump stack is currently sized based
on the number of user chains.

However, its rather unlikely that every user defined chain jumps to the
next, so lets use the existing loop detection logic to also track the
chain depths.

The stacksize is then set to the largest chain depth seen.
