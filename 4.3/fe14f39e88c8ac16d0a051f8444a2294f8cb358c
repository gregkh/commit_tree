ALSA: hda - Fix pin config and mapping on Alienware 15

Alienware 15 has CA0132 codec for its onboard sound, but the pin
config and mapping seem quite different from other Creative boards.
This patch corrects them, at least, for providing the right headphone
and mic jack notification, as well as removing the non-existing SPDIF
pins.

Even with this fix, not all stuff works perfectly yet, mainly because
of the badly written ca0132 driver code -- it has too many implicit
assumptions of pin configs and maps.  Nevertheless, this is a small
good step forward.
