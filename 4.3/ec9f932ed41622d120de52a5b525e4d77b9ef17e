drm/atomic: Cleanup on error properly in the atomic ioctl.

It's probably allowed to leave old_fb set to garbage when unlocking,
but to prevent undefined behavior unset it just in case.

Also crtc_state->event could be NULL on memory allocation failure,
in which case event_space is increased for no reason.

Note: Contains some general simplification of the cleanup code too.
