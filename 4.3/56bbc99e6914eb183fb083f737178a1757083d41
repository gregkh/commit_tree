Input: max77693: Add support for Maxim 77843

The Maxim 77843 haptic driver differs from 77693 by:
1. Setting the bias.
2. Different configuration register.
3. Not enabling the low-sys DAC.
4. Using same regmap for PMIC and haptic blocks.

Incorporate all differences into max77693 haptic driver so both devices
can be supported.
