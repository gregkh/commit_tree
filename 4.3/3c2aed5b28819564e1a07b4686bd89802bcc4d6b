ARM: domains: get rid of manager mode for user domain

Since we switched to early trap initialisation in 94e5a85b3be0
("ARM: earlier initialization of vectors page") we haven't been writing
directly to the vectors page, and so there's no need for this domain
to be in manager mode.  Switch it to client mode.
