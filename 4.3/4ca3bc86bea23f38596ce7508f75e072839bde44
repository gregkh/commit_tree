arm64: Don't relocate non-existent initrd

When booting a kernel without an initrd, the kernel reports that it
moves -1 bytes worth, having gone through the motions with initrd_start
equal to initrd_end:

    Moving initrd from [4080000000-407fffffff] to [9fff49000-9fff48fff]

Prevent this by bailing out early when the initrd size is zero (i.e. we
have no initrd), avoiding the confusing message and other associated
work.
