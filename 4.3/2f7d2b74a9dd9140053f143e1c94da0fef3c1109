powerpc/mm: Don't call __flush_dcache_icache_phys() with PA>VA

__flush_dcache_icache_phys() requires the ability to access the
memory with the MMU disabled, which means that on a 32-bit system
any memory above 4 GiB is inaccessible.  In particular, mpc86xx is
32-bit and can have more than 4 GiB of RAM.
