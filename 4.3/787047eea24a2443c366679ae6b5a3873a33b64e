ARM: 8392/3: smp: Only expose /sys/.../cpuX/online if hotpluggable

Writes to /sys/.../cpuX/online fail if we determine the platform
doesn't support hotplug for that CPU. Furthermore, if the cpu_die
op isn't specified the system hangs when we try to offline a CPU
and it comes right back online unexpectedly. Let's figure this
stuff out before we make the sysfs nodes so that the online file
doesn't even exist if it isn't (at least sometimes) possible to
hotplug the CPU.

Add a new 'cpu_can_disable' op and repoint all 'cpu_disable'
implementations at it because all implementers use the op to
indicate if a CPU can be hotplugged or not in a static fashion.
With PSCI we may need to add a 'cpu_disable' op so that the
secure OS can be migrated off the CPU we're trying to hotplug.
In this case, the 'cpu_can_disable' op will indicate that all
CPUs are hotpluggable by returning true, but the 'cpu_disable' op
will make a PSCI migration call and occasionally fail, denying
the hotplug of a CPU. This shouldn't be any worse than x86 where
we may indicate that all CPUs are hotpluggable but occasionally
we can't offline a CPU due to check_irq_vectors_for_cpu_disable()
failing to find a CPU to move vectors to.
