drm/exynos: wait all planes updates to finish

Add infrastructure to wait for all planes updates to finish by using
an atomic_t variable to track how many pending updates we are waiting
plus a wait_queue for the wait part.

It also changes vblank behaviour and keeps it enabled for all types
of updates
