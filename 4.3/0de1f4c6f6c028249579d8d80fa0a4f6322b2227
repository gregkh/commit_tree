Add way to query server fs info for smb3

The server exports information about the share and underlying
device under an SMB3 export, including its attributes and
capabilities, which is stored by cifs.ko when first connecting
to the share.

Add ioctl to cifs.ko to allow user space smb3 helper utilities
(in cifs-utils) to display this (e.g. via smb3util).

This information is also useful for debugging and for
resolving configuration errors.
