x86/entry: Fix _TIF_USER_RETURN_NOTIFY check in prepare_exit_to_usermode

Linus noticed that the early return check was missing
_TIF_USER_RETURN_NOTIFY.  If the only work flag was
_TIF_USER_RETURN_NOTIFY, we'd skip user return notifiers.  Fix
it. (This is the only missing bit.)

This fixes double faults on a KVM host.  It's the same issue as
last time, except that this time it's very easy to trigger.
Apparently no one uses -next as a KVM host.

( I'm still not quite sure what it is that KVM does that blows up
  so badly if we miss a user return notifier.  My best guess is that KVM
  lets KERNEL_GS_BASE (i.e. the user's gs base) be negative and fixes
  it up in a user return notifier.  If we actually end up in user mode
  with a negative gs base, we blow up pretty badly. )
