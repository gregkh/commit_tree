md: be careful when testing resync_max against curr_resync_completed.

While it generally shouldn't happen, it is not impossible for
curr_resync_completed to exceed resync_max.
This can particularly happen when reshaping RAID5 - the current
status isn't copied to curr_resync_completed promptly, so when it
is, it can exceed resync_max.
This happens when the reshape is 'frozen', resync_max is set low,
and reshape is re-enabled.

Taking a difference between two unsigned numbers is always dangerous
anyway, so add a test to behave correctly if
   curr_resync_completed > resync_max
