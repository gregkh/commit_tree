KVM: s390: host STP toleration for VMs

If the host has STP enabled, the TOD of the host will be changed during
synchronization phases. These are performed during a stop_machine() call.

As the guest TOD is based on the host TOD, we have to make sure that:
- no VCPU is in the SIE (implicitly guaranteed via stop_machine())
- manual guest TOD calculations are not affected

"Epoch" is the guest TOD clock delta to the host TOD clock. We have to
adjust that value during the STP synchronization and make sure that code
that accesses the epoch won't get interrupted in between (via disabling
preemption).
