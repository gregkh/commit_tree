MIPS: CPC: Remove "weak" from mips_cpc_phys_base() and make it static

There's only one implementation of mips_cpc_phys_base(), and it's only used
within the same file, so it doesn't need to be weak, and it doesn't need an
extern declaration.

Remove the extern mips_cpc_phys_base() declaration and make it static.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Fixed conflict.]
