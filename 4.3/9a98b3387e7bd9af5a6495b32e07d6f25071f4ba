HID: rmi: Set F01 interrupt enable register when not set

A firmware bug in some touchpads causes the F01 interrupt enable register
to be cleared on reset. This register controls which RMI functions generate
interrupts and when it is cleared, the touchpad stops reporting all data.
This patch looks for the cleared F01 control register and writes the
correct value based on interrupt mask computed while scanning the PDT.
