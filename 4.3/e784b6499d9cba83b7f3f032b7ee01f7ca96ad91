powerpc/powernv: Invoke opal_cec_reboot2() on unrecoverable machine check errors.

On non-recoverable MCE errors in kernel space, Linux kernel panics
and system reboots. On BMC based system opal-prd runs as a daemon
in the host. Hence, kernel crash may prevent opal-prd to detect and
analyze this MCE error. This may land us in a situation where the faulty
memory never gets de-configured and Linux would keep hitting same MCE error
again and again. If this happens in early stage of kernel initialization,
then Linux will keep crashing and rebooting in a loop.

This patch fixes this issue by invoking new opal_cec_reboot2() call with
reboot type OPAL_REBOOT_PLATFORM_ERROR to inform BMC/OCC about this
error, so that BMC can collect relevant data for error analysis and
decide what component to de-configure before rebooting.

This patch is dependent on OPAL patchset posted on skiboot mailing list
at https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/skiboot/2015-July/001771.html that
introduces opal_cec_reboot2() opal call.
