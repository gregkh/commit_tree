eCryptfs: Invalidate dcache entries when lower i_nlink is zero

Consider eCryptfs dcache entries to be stale when the corresponding
lower inode's i_nlink count is zero. This solves a problem caused by the
lower inode being directly modified, without going through the eCryptfs
mount, leaving stale eCryptfs dentries cached and the eCryptfs inode's
i_nlink count not being cleared.
