ath10k: include 10.4 fw specific wmi cmd and event ids

10.4 firmware wmi cmd and event id values are not exactly aligned
with previous firmware versions (main, 10.x, 10.2, etc). Add new
enum to define wmi cmd & event definitions for 10.4 firmware and
prepare wmi_10_4_cmd_map based on 10.4 firmware wmi cmd definitions.

wmi_cmd_map is extended to accommodate new wmi commands which are
exclusively available in 10.4 firmware.
