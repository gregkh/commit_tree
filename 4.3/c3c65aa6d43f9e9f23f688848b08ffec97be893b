x86/platform/intel/pmc_atom: Print index of device in loop

The register mapping may change from one platform to another.
Thus, indices might be not the same on different platforms. The
patch makes the code to print the device index dynamically at
run time.

The patch also changes the for loop to iterate over the map
until a terminator is found.
