drm/i915: Fix 852GM/GMV cdclk

It seems 852GM/GMV uses a different HPLLCC encoding than the other
85x platforms. For 852GM/GMV cdclk is always 133MHz. Try to detect that
using the PCI revision (sinc the device ID seems useless for that). I'm
not at all sure this is a good idea, but according to the specs it
should work.
