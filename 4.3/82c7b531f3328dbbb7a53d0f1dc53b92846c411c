ASoC: uda134x: Explicitly handle in-data addresses

The UDA134X family extends the rather limited L3 register set by using part
of the register value as additional address bits.

These extra address bits are currently stored in the default register cache
and rely on them remaining constant. While this works it is rather
idiomatic and slightly confusing. Change it so that the additional address
bits are explicitly added when writing a register.
