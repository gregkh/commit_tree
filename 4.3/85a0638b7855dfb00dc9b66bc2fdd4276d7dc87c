[media] v4l: vsp1: Align crop rectangle to even boundary for YUV formats

Make sure that there are valid values in the crop rectangle to ensure
that the color plane doesn't get shifted when cropping.
Since there is no distinction between 12bit and 16bit YUV formats in
at the subdev level, use the more restrictive 12bit limits for all YUV
formats.
