block: simplify bio_add_page()

Since generic_make_request() can now handle arbitrary size bios, all we
have to do is make sure the bvec array doesn't overflow.
__bio_add_page() doesn't need to call ->merge_bvec_fn(), where
we can get rid of unnecessary code paths.

Removing the call to ->merge_bvec_fn() is also fine, as no driver that
implements support for BLOCK_PC commands even has a ->merge_bvec_fn()
method.

[dpark: rebase and resolve merge conflicts, change a couple of comments,
 make bio_add_page() warn once upon a cloned bio.]
