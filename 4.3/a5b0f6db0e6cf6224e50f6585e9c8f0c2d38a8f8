MIPS: CPS: Don't include MT code in non-MT kernels.

The MT-specific code in mips_cps_boot_vpes can safely be omitted from
kernels which don't support MT, with the default VPE==0 case being used
as it would be after the has_mt (Config3.MT) check failed at runtime.
Discarding the code entirely will save us a few bytes & allow cleaner
handling of MT ASE instructions by later patches.
