scatterlist: allow limited chaining without ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN

There are a couple of uses of struct scatterlist that never go to
the dma_map_sg() helper and thus don't care about ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN
which indicates that we can map chained S/G list.

The most important one is the crypto code, which currently has
to open code a few helpers to always allow chaining.  This patch
removes a few #ifdef ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN statements so that we can
switch the crypto code to these common helpers.
