f2fs: maintain extent cache in separated file

This patch moves extent cache related code from data.c into extent_cache.c
since extent cache is independent feature, and its codes are not relate to
others in data.c, it's better for us to maintain them in separated place.

There is no functionality change, but several small coding style fixes
including:
* rename __drop_largest_extent to f2fs_drop_largest_extent for exporting;
* rename misspelled word 'untill' to 'until';
* remove unneeded 'return' in the end of f2fs_destroy_extent_tree().
