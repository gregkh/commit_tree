HID: microsoft: Add Surface 3 type cover

Adding support for the Microsoft Surface 3 (non-pro) Type Cover.

The existing definitions and quirks are actually for the Surface
Pro 3 type covers. I've renamed the old constants to reflect that
they belong to the Surface Pro 3, and added a new constant and
matching code for the Surface 3.
