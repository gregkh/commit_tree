sign-file: Add option to only create signature file

Make the -d option (which currently isn't actually wired to anything) write
out the PKCS#7 message as per the -p option and then exit without either
modifying the source or writing out a compound file of the source, signature
and metadata.

This will be useful when firmware signature support is added
upstream as firmware will be left intact, and we'll only require
the signature file. The descriptor is implicit by file extension
and the file's own size.
