ALSA: hda - yet another fix for Dell headset mic with ALC3266

It turned out that there are three variants of pin config values of
NID 0x17 on Dell laptops with ALC3266 (alias of ALC298): 0x90170110,
0x90170140 and 0x90170150.  The first two have been already covered by
commits 703867e2f252 and 977e627684df, so this commit adds the missing
last entry.

While we're at it, rearrange the three entries in the order of pincfg
values.
