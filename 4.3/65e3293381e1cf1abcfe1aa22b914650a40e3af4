ARM: dts: fix clock-frequency of display timing0 for exynos3250-rinato

After the commit abc0b1447d49 ("drm: Perform basic sanity checks on
probed modes"), proper clock-frequency becomes mandatory for
validating the mode of panel.  The display does not work if there is
no mode validated. Also, this clock-frequency must be set
appropriately for getting required frame rate.
