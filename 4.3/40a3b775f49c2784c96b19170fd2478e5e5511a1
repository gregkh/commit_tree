xhci: xHCI 1.1: Stopped - Short Packet Capability (SPC)

This patch enables xhci driver to support SPC by handling
Stopped - Short Packet event in transfer event path.

If SPC = '1' and the stop endpoint command is executed, after a Short
Packet condition has been detected, but before the end of the TD has been
reached, (i.e. the TD is in progress for pipe), then a Transfer Event TRB
with its Completion Code set to Stopped - Short Packet and its TRB
Transfer Length set to value of the EDTLA shall be forced for the
interrupted TRB, irrespective of whether its IOC or ISP flags are set.
This Transfer Event TRB will precede the Command Completion Event TRB for
the command, and is referred to as a Stopped Transfer Event.
