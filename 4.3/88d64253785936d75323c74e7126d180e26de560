s390/hibernate: fix save and restore of vector registers

The swsusp_arch_suspend()/swsusp_arch_resume() functions currently only
save and restore the floating point registers. If the task that started
the hibernation process is using vector registers they can get lost.
To fix this just call save_fpu_regs in swsusp_arch_suspend(), the restore
will happen automatically on return to user space.
