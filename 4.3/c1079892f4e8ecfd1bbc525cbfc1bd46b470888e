f2fs: make the function check_dnode have a return type of bool and change it's name to is_alive

This makes the function check_dnode have a return type of bool
due to this particular function only ever returning either one
or zero as its return value and changes the name of the function
to is_alive in order to better explain this function's intended
work of checking if a dnode is still in use by the filesystem.
