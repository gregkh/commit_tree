crypto: caam - add support for LS1021A

LS1021A is a QorIQ SoC having little endian CAAM.

There are a few differences b/w QorIQ and i.MX from CAAM perspective:

1. i.MX platforms are somewhat special wrt. 64-bit registers:
-big endian format at 64-bit level: MSW at address+0 and LSW at address+4
-little endian format at 32-bit level (within MSW and LSW)
and thus need special handling.

2. No CCM (clock controller module) for QorIQ.
No CAAM clocks to enable / disable.

A new Kconfig option - CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_CAAM_LE - is added to indicate
CAAM is little endian (*). It is hidden from the user (to avoid
misconfiguration); when adding support for a new platform with LE CAAM,
either the Kconfig needs to be updated or the corresponding defconfig
needs to indicate that CAAM is LE.
(*) Using a DT property to provide CAAM endianness would not allow
for the ifdeffery.

In order to keep changes to a minimum, the following changes
are postponed:
-endianness fix of the last word in the S/G (rsvd2, bpid, offset),
fields are always 0 anyway;
-S/G format fix for i.MX7 (yes, i.MX7 support was not added yet,
but still...)
