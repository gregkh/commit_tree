Make asm/word-at-a-time.h available on all architectures

Added the x86 implementation of word-at-a-time to the
generic version, which previously only supported big-endian.

Omitted the x86-specific load_unaligned_zeropad(), which in
any case is also not present for the existing BE-only
implementation of a word-at-a-time, and is only used under
CONFIG_DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS.

Added as a "generic-y" to the Kbuilds of all architectures
that didn't previously have it.
