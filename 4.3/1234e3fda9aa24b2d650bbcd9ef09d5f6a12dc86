ARM: reduce visibility of dmac_* functions

The dmac_* functions are private to the ARM DMA API implementation, and
should not be used by drivers.  In order to discourage their use, remove
their prototypes and macros from asm/*.h.

We have to leave dmac_flush_range() behind as Exynos and MSM IOMMU code
use these; once these sites are fixed, this can be moved also.
