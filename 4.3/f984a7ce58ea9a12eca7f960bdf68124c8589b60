nfsd: return CLID_INUSE for unexpected SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM case

Somebody with a Solaris client was hitting this case.  We haven't
figured out why yet, and don't have a reproducer.  Meanwhile Frank
noticed that RFC 7530 actually recommends CLID_INUSE for this case.
Unlikely to help the original reporter, but may as well fix it.
