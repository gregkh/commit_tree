batman-adv: Annotate deleting functions with external lock via lockdep

Functions which use (h)list_del* are requiring correct locking when they
operate on global lists. Most of the time the search in the list and the
delete are done in the same function. All other cases should have it
visible that they require a special lock to avoid race conditions.

Lockdep asserts can be used to check these problem during runtime when the
lockdep functionality is enabled.
