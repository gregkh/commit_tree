s390/numa: add topology tree infrastructure

NUMA emulation needs proper means to mangle the book/mc/core topology
of the machine. The topology tree (toptree) consistently maintains cpu
masks for the root, each node, and all leaves of the tree while the
user may use the toptree functions to rearrange the tree in various
ways.

This patch contains several changes from Michael Holzheu.
