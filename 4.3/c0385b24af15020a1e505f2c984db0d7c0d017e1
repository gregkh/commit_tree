arm64: introduce CONFIG_ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS as fallback to ll/sc atomics

In order to patch in the new atomic instructions at runtime, we need to
generate wrappers around the out-of-line exclusive load/store atomics.

This patch adds a new Kconfig option, CONFIG_ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS. which
causes our atomic functions to branch to the out-of-line ll/sc
implementations. To avoid the register spill overhead of the PCS, the
out-of-line functions are compiled with specific compiler flags to
force out-of-line save/restore of any registers that are usually
caller-saved.
