perf/x86/intel: Add support for PEBSv3 profiling

PEBSv3 is the same as the existing PEBSv2 used on Haswell,
but it adds a new TSC field. Add support to the generic
PEBS handler to handle the new format, and overwrite
the perf time stamp using the new native_sched_clock_from_tsc().

Right now the time stamp is just slightly more accurate,
as it is nearer the actual event trigger point. With
the PEBS threshold > 1 patchkit it will be much more accurate,
avoid the problems with MMAP mismatches earlier.
The accurate time stamping is only implemented for
the default trace clock for now.

v2: Use _skl prefix. Check for default clock_id.
