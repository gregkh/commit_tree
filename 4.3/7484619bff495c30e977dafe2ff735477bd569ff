ACPICA: Tables: Cleanup to reduce FACS globals

ACPICA commit 3f42ba76e2a0453976d3108296d5f656fdf2bd6e

In this patch, FACS table mapping is also tuned a bit so that only the
selected FACS table will be mapped by the OSPM (mapped on demand) and the
FACS related global variables can be reduced. Lv Zheng.
