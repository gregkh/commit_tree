drm/i915: BDW clock change support

Add support for changing cdclk frequency during runtime on BDW.

Also with IPS enabled the actual pixel rate mustn't exceed 95% of cdclk,
so take that into account when computing the max pixel rate.

v2: Grab rps.hw_lock around sandybridge_pcode_write()
v3: Rebase due to power well vs. .global_resources() reordering
v4: Rebased to the latest
v5: Rebased to the latest
v6: Patch order shuffle so that Broadwell CD clock change is
    applied before the patch for Haswell CD clock change
v7: Fix for patch style problems
