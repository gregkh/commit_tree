IB/iser: Maintain connection fmr_pool under a single registration descriptor

This will allow us to unify the memory registration code path between
the various methods which vary by the device capabilities. This change
will make it easier and less intrusive to remove fmr_pools from the
code when we'd want to.

The reason we use a single descriptor is to avoid taking a
redundant spinlock when working with FMRs.

We also change the signature of iser_reg_page_vec to make it match
iser_fast_reg_mr (and the future indirect registration method).
