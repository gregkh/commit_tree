ALSA: hda - Disable power_save_node for Thinkpads

Lenovo Thinkpads with recent Realtek codecs seem suffering from click
noises at power transition since the introduction of widget power
saving in 4.1 kernel.  Although this might be solved by some delays in
appropriate points, as a quick workaround, just disable the
power_save_node feature for now.  The gain it gives is relatively
small, and this makes the situation back to pre 4.1 time.

This patch ended up with a bit more code changes than usual because
the existing fixup for Thinkpads is highly chained.  Instead of adding
yet another chain, combine a few of them into a single fixup entry, as
a gratis cleanup.
