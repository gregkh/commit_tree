block: Refuse request/bio merges with gaps in the integrity payload

If a driver sets the block queue virtual boundary mask, it means that
it cannot handle gaps so we must not allow those in the integrity
payload as well.

Fixed up by me to have duplicate integrity merge functions, depending
on whether block integrity is enabled or not. Fixes a compilations
issue with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INTEGRITY unset.
