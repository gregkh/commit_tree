drm/i915: atomic plane updates in a nutshell

Now that all planes are added during a modeset we can use the
calculated changes before disabling a plane, and then either commit
or force disable a plane before disabling the crtc.

The code is shared with atomic_begin/flush, except watermark updating
and vblank evasion are not used.

This is needed for proper atomic suspend/resume support.
