pty: Add debug message for ptmx open

Opens of /dev/ptmx don't use tty_open() so debug messages are
not printed for those opens; print a debug message with the
open count (which must always be 1) if TTY_DEBUG_HANGUP is defined.

NB: Each tty core source file undefs support for debug messages.
The relevant source file must be patched/edited to enable these
messages.
