blkcg: use CGROUP_WEIGHT_* scale for io.weight on the unified hierarchy

cgroup is trying to make interface consistent across different
controllers.  For weight based resource control, the knob should have
the range [1, 10000] and default to 100.  This patch updates
cfq-iosched so that the weight range conforms.  The internal
calculations have enough range and the widening of the weight range
shouldn't cause any problem.

* blkcg_policy->cpd_bind_fn() is added.  If present, this is invoked
  when blkcg is attached to a hierarchy.

* cfq_cpd_init() is updated to use the new default value on the
  unified hierarchy.

* cfq_cpd_bind() callback is implemented to clear per-blkg configs and
  apply the default config matching the hierarchy type.

* cfqd->root_group->[leaf_]weight initialization in cfq_init_queue()
  is moved into !CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED block.  cfq_cpd_bind() is
  now responsible for initializing the initial weights when blkcg is
  enabled.
