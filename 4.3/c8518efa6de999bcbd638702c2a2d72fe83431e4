mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: don't use ->set_power to set initial regulator state

If the regulator is enabled on boot (checked using regulator_is_enabled),
invoke regulator_enable() so that the usecount reflects the correct
state of the regulator and then disable the regulator so that the
initial state of the regulator is disabled. Avoid using ->set_power,
since set_power also takes care of setting the voltages which is not
needed at this point.
