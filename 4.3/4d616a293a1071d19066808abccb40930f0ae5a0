drm/i915: Update intel_logical_ring_begin() to take a request structure

Now that everything above has been converted to use requests,
intel_logical_ring_begin() can be updated to take a request instead of a
ringbuf/context pair. This also means that it no longer needs to lazily allocate
a request if no-one happens to have done it earlier.

Note that this change makes the execlist signature the same as the legacy
version. Thus the two functions could be merged into a ring->begin() wrapper if
required.
