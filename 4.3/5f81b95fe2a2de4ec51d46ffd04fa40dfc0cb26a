cxl: fix leak of ctx->mapping when releasing kernel API contexts

When a context is created via the kernel API, ctx->mapping is allocated
within the kernel and thus needs to be freed when the context is freed.
reclaim_ctx() attempts to do this for contexts with the ctx->kernelapi flag
set, but afu_release() (which can be called from the kernel API through
cxl_fd_release()) sets ctx->mapping to NULL before calling
cxl_context_free() to free the context.

Add a check to afu_release() so that the mappings in contexts created via
the kernel API are left alone so reclaim_ctx() can free them.
