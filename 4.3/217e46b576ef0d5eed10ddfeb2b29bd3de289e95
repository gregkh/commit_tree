drm/i915: Update alloc_request to return the allocated request

The alloc_request() function does not actually return the newly allocated
request. Instead, it must be pulled from ring->outstanding_lazy_request. This
patch fixes this so that code can create a request and start using it knowing
exactly which request it actually owns.

v2: Updated for new i915_gem_request_alloc() scheme.
