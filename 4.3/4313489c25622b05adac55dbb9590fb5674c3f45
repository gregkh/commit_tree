ASoC: ux500: adjust devm usage

The explicit call to devm_regulator_put in the probe and remove functions
does not seem to be necessary.  In particular, the functions
prcmu_qos_remove_requirement and ux500_msp_i2s_cleanup_msp in the remove
function seem to do nothing that can interfere with devm_regulator_put,
making it safe to allow devm_regulator_put to occur after the end of the
remove function.

Convert the calls to clk_get to devm_clk_get, and remove the corresponding
calls to clk_put in the probe and remove functions.

Replace various gotos by direct returns, and drop unneeded labels.
