net/mlx5e: Avoid accessing NULL pointer at ndo_select_queue

To avoid multiply/division operations on the data path,
we hold a {channel, tc}==>txq mapping table.
We held this mapping table inside the channel object that is
being destroyed upon some configuration operations (e.g MTU change).
So in case ndo_select_queue occurs during such a configuration operation,
it may access a NULL channel pointer, resulting in kernel panic.
To fix this issue we moved the {channel, tc}==>txq mapping table
outside the channel object so that it will be available also
during such configuration operations.
