Bluetooth: hci_intel: Add Intel baudrate configuration support

Implement the set_baudrate callback for hci_intel.
 - Controller requires a read Intel version command before updating
   its baudrate.
 - The operation consists in an async cmd since the controller does
   not respond at the same speed.
 - Wait 100ms to let the controller change its baudrate.
 - Clear RTS until we change our own UART speed

Manage speed change in the setup function, we need to restore the oper
speed once chip has booted on patched firmware.
