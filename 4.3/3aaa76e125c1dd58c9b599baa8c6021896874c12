mm: migrate: hugetlb: putback destination hugepage to active list

Since commit bcc54222309c ("mm: hugetlb: introduce page_huge_active")
each hugetlb page maintains its active flag to avoid a race condition
betwe= en multiple calls of isolate_huge_page(), but current kernel
doesn't set the f= lag on a hugepage allocated by migration because the
proper putback routine isn= 't called.  This means that users could
still encounter the race referred to by bcc54222309c in this special
case, so this patch fixes it.
