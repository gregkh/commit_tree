userfaultfd: change the read API to return a uffd_msg

I had requests to return the full address (not the page aligned one) to
userland.

It's not entirely clear how the page offset could be relevant because
userfaults aren't like SIGBUS that can sigjump to a different place and it
actually skip resolving the fault depending on a page offset.  There's
currently no real way to skip the fault especially because after a
UFFDIO_COPY|ZEROPAGE, the fault is optimized to be retried within the
kernel without having to return to userland first (not even self modifying
code replacing the .text that touched the faulting address would prevent
the fault to be repeated).  Userland cannot skip repeating the fault even
more so if the fault was triggered by a KVM secondary page fault or any
get_user_pages or any copy-user inside some syscall which will return to
kernel code.  The second time FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT won't be set leading
to a SIGBUS being raised because the userfault can't wait if it cannot
release the mmap_map first (and FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT is required for
that).

Still returning userland a proper structure during the read() on the uffd,
can allow to use the current UFFD_API for the future non-cooperative
extensions too and it looks cleaner as well.  Once we get additional
fields there's no point to return the fault address page aligned anymore
to reuse the bits below PAGE_SHIFT.

The only downside is that the read() syscall will read 32bytes instead of
8bytes but that's not going to be measurable overhead.

The total number of new events that can be extended or of new future bits
for already shipped events, is limited to 64 by the features field of the
uffdio_api structure.  If more will be needed a bump of UFFD_API will be
required.
