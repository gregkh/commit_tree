perf tools: Add Intel PT log

Add a facility to log Intel Processor Trace decoding.  The log is
intended for debugging purposes only.

The log file name is "intel_pt.log" and is opened in the current
directory.  The log contains a record of all packets and instructions
decoded and can get very large (10 MB would be a small one).
