cifs: Fix use-after-free on mid_q_entry

With CIFS_DEBUG_2 enabled, additional debug information is tracked inside each
mid_q_entry struct, however cifs_save_when_sent may use the mid_q_entry after it
has been freed from the appropriate callback if the transport layer has very low
latency. Holding the srv_mutex fixes this use-after-free, as cifs_save_when_sent
is called while the srv_mutex is held while the request is sent.
