dmaengine: add a driver for Intel integrated DMA 64-bit

Intel integrated DMA (iDMA) 64-bit is a specific IP that is used as a part of
LPSS devices such as HSUART or SPI. The iDMA IP is attached for private
usage on each host controller independently.

While it has similarities with Synopsys DesignWare DMA, the following
distinctions doesn't allow to use the existing driver:
- 64-bit mode with corresponding changes in Hardware Linked List data structure
- many slight differences in the channel registers

Moreover this driver is based on the DMA virtual channels framework that helps
to make the driver cleaner and easy to understand.
