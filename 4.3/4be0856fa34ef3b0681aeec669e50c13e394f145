ARM: pxa: transition to dmaengine phase 1

In order to slowly transition pxa to dmaengine, the legacy code will now
rely on dmaengine to request a channel.

This implies that PXA architecture selects DMADEVICES and PXA_DMA,
which is not pretty. Yet it enables PXA drivers to be ported one by one,
with part of them using dmaengine, and the other part using the legacy
code.
