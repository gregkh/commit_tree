md: sync sync_completed has correct value as recovery finishes.

There can be a small window between the moment that recovery
actually writes the last block and the time when various sysfs
and /proc/mdstat attributes report that it has finished.
During this time, 'sync_completed' can have the wrong value.
This can confuse monitoring software.

So:
 - don't set curr_resync_completed beyond the end of the devices,
 - set it correctly when resync/recovery has completed.
