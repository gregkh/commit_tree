ASoC: max98090: Fix sequencing when starting additional routes

Enforce correct device sequencing when configuring a new
audio route when there is an existing active audio route(s).

This patch fixed recording noise issue while playback is active.

We have some registers which require the device to be in full shutdown
or to enter full shutdown before the register settings will take effect.
Currently the driver is not shutting down the device when a new audio
route is created. If a new audio route is made active while there is
already an active audio route, then the required register sequencing is
violated. A hardware shutdown toggle when creating a new audio route
corrects the sequencing error. The device must remain in hardware
shutdown for 40ms to allow the internal hardware core to fully shutdown.
