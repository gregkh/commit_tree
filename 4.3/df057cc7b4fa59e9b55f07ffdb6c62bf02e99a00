arm64: errata: add module build workaround for erratum #843419

Cortex-A53 processors <= r0p4 are affected by erratum #843419 which can
lead to a memory access using an incorrect address in certain sequences
headed by an ADRP instruction.

There is a linker fix to generate veneers for ADRP instructions, but
this doesn't work for kernel modules which are built as unlinked ELF
objects.

This patch adds a new config option for the erratum which, when enabled,
builds kernel modules with the mcmodel=large flag. This uses absolute
addressing for all kernel symbols, thereby removing the use of ADRP as
a PC-relative form of addressing. The ADRP relocs are removed from the
module loader so that we fail to load any potentially affected modules.
