i2c: xiic: Remove the disabling of interrupts

Currently before every transfer the interrupts are disabled.
So incase the slave nacks in the middle of the transfer the
current transfer is not aborted. Upon enabling the interrupts
conditions like NACK , arbitration lost will not be masked.
Remove the disabling of the interrupts.
