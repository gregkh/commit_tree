staging: rtl8188eu: remove unused {en,dis}able_interrupt

rtw_hal_enable_interrupt() and rtw_hal_disable_interrupt() are never
referenced, so remove them.

They used to be the only place where the enable_interrupt() and
disable_interrupt() callbacks were called, and the function pointer
is never set, so get rid of the function pointer as well.
