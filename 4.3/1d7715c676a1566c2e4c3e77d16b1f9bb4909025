mmu-notifier: add clear_young callback

In the scope of the idle memory tracking feature, which is introduced by
the following patch, we need to clear the referenced/accessed bit not only
in primary, but also in secondary ptes.  The latter is required in order
to estimate wss of KVM VMs.  At the same time we want to avoid flushing
tlb, because it is quite expensive and it won't really affect the final
result.

Currently, there is no function for clearing pte young bit that would meet
our requirements, so this patch introduces one.  To achieve that we have
to add a new mmu-notifier callback, clear_young, since there is no method
for testing-and-clearing a secondary pte w/o flushing tlb.  The new method
is not mandatory and currently only implemented by KVM.
