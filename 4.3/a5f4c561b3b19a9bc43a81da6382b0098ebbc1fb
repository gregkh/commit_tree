ARM: 8415/1: early fixmap support for earlycon

Add early fixmap support, initially to support permanent, fixed
mapping support for early console. A temporary, early pte is
created which is migrated to a permanent mapping in paging_init.
This is also needed since the attributes may change as the memory
types are initialized. The 3MiB range of fixmap spans two pte
tables, but currently only one pte is created for early fixmap
support.

Re-add FIX_KMAP_BEGIN to the index calculation in highmem.c since
the index for kmap does not start at zero anymore. This reverts
4221e2e6b316 ("ARM: 8031/1: fixmap: remove FIX_KMAP_BEGIN and
FIX_KMAP_END") to some extent.
