More and more boards are moving to have audio support via simple-card.
At the same time enable options needed for most am335x and am43xx board for
audio support: McASP and TLV320AIC3X codecs.
The later two has been selected by the CONFIG_SND_AM33XX_SOC_EVM option, but
the aim is to convert all boards to use simple card.
