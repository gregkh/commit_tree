staging: unisys: visornic - consolidate+simplify xmit watermark checks

The code that tests for high and low xmit watermarks was consolidatedand
simplified. The output behavior should be identical, with the exception
of an off-by-one error being corrected in the tests done when the counters
overflowed.
