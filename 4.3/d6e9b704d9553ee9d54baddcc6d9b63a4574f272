ata: pata_arasam_cf: Use devm_clk_get

This patch introduces the use of managed resource function
devm_clk_get instead of clk_get and removes corresponding call
to clk_put in the remove function.

To be compatible with the change various gotos are replaced with
direct returns, and unneeded label is dropped.
