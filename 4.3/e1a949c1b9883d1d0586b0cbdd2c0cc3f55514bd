toshiba_acpi: Refactor *{get, set} functions return value

This patch refactors the return value of the driver *{get, set}
functions, since the driver default error value is -EIO.

All the functions now check for TOS_FAILURE, TOS_NOT_SUPPORTED and
TOS_SUCCESS.

On TOS_FAILURE a pr_err message is printed informing the user of the
error (no change was made to this, except the check was added to the
functions not checking for this).

On TOS_NOT_SUPPORTED we now return -ENODEV immediately (some
functions were returning -EIO and some other were not checking)

On TOS_SUCCESS* we now return 0 (as a side effect, a new success value
was added, since some functions return one instead of zero to
indicate success).

As a special case, the LED functions now check for *FAILURE on
*set, and check for TOS_FAILURE and TOS_SUCCESS on *get with their
"default" return value set to LED_OFF.

Also the {lcd, video}_proc* functions were adapted to reflect these
changes to their parent HCI functions.
