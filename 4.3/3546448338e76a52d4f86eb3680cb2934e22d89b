drivers:hv: Move MMIO range picking from hyper_fb to hv_vmbus

This patch deletes the logic from hyperv_fb which picked a range of MMIO space
for the frame buffer and adds new logic to hv_vmbus which picks ranges for
child drivers.  The new logic isn't quite the same as the old, as it considers
more possible ranges.
