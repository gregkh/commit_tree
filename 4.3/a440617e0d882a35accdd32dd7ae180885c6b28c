coresight-etm3x: Support context-ID tracing when PID namespace is enabled

The Coresight ETM drivers already support context-ID tracing, but it won't
work when PID namespace is enabled. This is because when using PID
namespace a process id (ie. VPID) seen from the current namespace differs
from the id (ie. PID) seen by kernel.

So when users write the process id seen by themselves to ETM, there needs
to be a translation from VPID to PID, as such ETM drivers will write the
PID into the Context ID register correctly.
