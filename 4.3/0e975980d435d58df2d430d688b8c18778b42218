drm: Turn off Legacy Context Functions

The context functions are not used by the i915 driver and should not
be used by modeset drivers. These driver functions contain several bugs
and security holes. This change makes these functions optional can be
turned on by a setting, they are turned off by default for modeset
driver with the exception of the nouvea driver that may require them with
an old version of libdrm.

The previous attempt was

  previous attempts
- drop the part touching the drm hw lock, that should be a separate
  patch.
