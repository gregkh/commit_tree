rtc: opal: Enable alarms only when opal supports tpo

rtc-opal driver provides support for rtc alarms via
timed-power-on(tpo). However some Power platforms like BML use a fake
rtc clock and don't support tpo. Such platforms are indicated by the
missing 'has-tpo' property in the device tree.

Current implementation however enables callback for
rtc_class_ops.read/set alarm irrespective of the tpo support from the
platform. This results in a failed opal call when kernel tries to read
an existing alarms via opal_get_tpo_time during rtc device registration.

This patch fixes this issue by setting opal_rtc_ops.read/set_alarm
callback pointers only when tpo is supported.
