scripts/kernel-doc Allow struct arguments documentation in struct body

Describing arguments at top of a struct definition works fine
for small/medium size structs, but it definitely doesn't work well
for struct with a huge list of elements.

Keeping the arguments list inside the struct body makes it easier
to maintain the documentation.
ie:
/**
 * struct my_struct - short description
 * @a: first member
 * @b: second member
 *
 * Longer description
 */
struct my_struct {
    int a;
    int b;
    /**
     * @c: This is longer description of C
     *
     * You can use paragraphs to describe arguments
     * using this method.
     */
    int c;
};

This patch allows the use of this kind of syntax. Only one argument
per comment and user can use how many paragraphs he needs. It should
start with /**, which is already being used by kernel-doc. If those
comment doesn't follow those rules, it will be ignored.
