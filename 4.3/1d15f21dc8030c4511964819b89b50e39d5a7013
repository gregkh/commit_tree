ASoC: tegra: Revert part of "ASoC: tegra: Convert to managed resources"

Revert the problematic part of commit 470805eb9f31 ("ASoC: tegra:
Convert to managed resources"). Before this commit, PM cleanup was
performed after the component was unregistered. But returning
directly will skip PM cleanup. So, to be on safe side it is better
to use snd_soc_register_component instead of
devm_snd_soc_register_component.
