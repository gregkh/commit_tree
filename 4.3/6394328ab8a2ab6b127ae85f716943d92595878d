f2fs: report error of fill_zero

fill_zero can fail due to a lot of reason, but previously we do not handle
its return value, so its callers such as punch_hole/f2fs_zero_range may
report success, but actually can fail because of error occurs inside
fill_zero.

This patch fixes to report correct return value of fill_zero.
