tipc: eliminate function tipc_link_activate()

The function tipc_link_activate() is redundant, since it mostly performs
settings that have already been done in a preceding tipc_link_reset().

There are three exceptions to this:
- The actual state change to TIPC_LINK_WORKING. This should anyway be done
  in the FSM, and not in a separate function.
- Registration of the link with the bearer. This should be done by the
  node, since we don't want the link to have any knowledge about its
  specific bearer.
- Call to tipc_node_link_up() for user access registration. With the new
  role distribution between link aggregation and link level this becomes
  the wrong call order; tipc_node_link_up() should instead be called
  directly as a result of a TIPC_LINK_UP event, hence by the node itself.

This commit implements those changes.
