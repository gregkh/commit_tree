f2fs: update on-disk extents even under extent_cache

Previously, f2fs_update_extent_cache() updates in-memory extent_cache all the
time, and then finally preserves its up-to-date extent into on-disk one during
f2fs_evict_inode.

But, in the following scenario:

1. mount
2. open & write an extent X
3. f2fs_evict_inode; on-disk extent is X
4. open & update the extent X with Y
5. sync; trigger checkpoint
6. power-cut

after power-on, f2fs should serve extent Y, but we have an on-disk extent X.

This causes a failure on xfstests/311.
