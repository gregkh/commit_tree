drm/i915: Convert resume to atomic.

Instead of all the ad-hoc updating, duplicate the old state first
before reading out the hw state, then restore it.

intel_display_resume is a new function that duplicates the sw state,
then reads out the hw state, and commits the old state.

intel_display_setup_hw_state now only reads out the atomic state.
