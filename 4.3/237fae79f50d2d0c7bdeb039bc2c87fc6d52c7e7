perf tools: Add Intel PT instruction decoder

Add support for decoding instructions for Intel Processor Trace.  The
kernel x86 instruction decoder is copied for this.

This essentially provides intel_pt_get_insn() which takes a binary
buffer, uses the kernel's x86 instruction decoder to get details of the
instruction and then categorizes it for consumption by an Intel PT
decoder.
