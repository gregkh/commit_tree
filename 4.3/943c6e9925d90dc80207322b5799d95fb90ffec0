btrfs: Add raid56 support for updating
 num_tolerated_disk_barrier_failures in btrfs_balance

Code for updating fs_info->num_tolerated_disk_barrier_failures in
btrfs_balance() lacks raid56 support.

Reason:
 Above code was wroten in 2012-08-01, together with
 btrfs_calc_num_tolerated_disk_barrier_failures()'s first version.

 Then, btrfs_calc_num_tolerated_disk_barrier_failures() got updated
 later to support raid56, but code in btrfs_balance() was not
 updated together.

Fix:
 Merge above similar code to a common function:
 btrfs_get_num_tolerated_disk_barrier_failures()
 and make it support both case.

 It can fix this bug with a bonus of cleanup, and make these code
 never in above no-sync state from now on.
