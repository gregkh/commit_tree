Drivers: hv: vmbus: Implement a clocksource based on the TSC page

The current Hyper-V clock source is based on the per-partition reference counter
and this counter is being accessed via s synthetic MSR - HV_X64_MSR_TIME_REF_COUNT.
Hyper-V has a more efficient way of computing the per-partition reference
counter value that does not involve reading a synthetic MSR. We implement
a time source based on this mechanism.
