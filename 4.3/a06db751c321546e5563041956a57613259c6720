pagemap: check permissions and capabilities at open time

This patchset makes pagemap useable again in the safe way (after row
hammer bug it was made CAP_SYS_ADMIN-only).  This patchset restores access
for non-privileged users but hides PFNs from them.

Also it adds bit 'map-exclusive' which is set if page is mapped only here:
it helps in estimation of working set without exposing pfns and allows to
distinguish CoWed and non-CoWed private anonymous pages.

Second patch removes page-shift bits and completes migration to the new
pagemap format: flags soft-dirty and mmap-exclusive are available only in
the new format.

This patch (of 5):

This patch moves permission checks from pagemap_read() into pagemap_open().

Pointer to mm is saved in file->private_data. This reference pins only
mm_struct itself. /proc/*/mem, maps, smaps already work in the same way.
