usb: udc: Convert use of __constant_cpu_to_leXX to cpu_to_leXX

In big endian cases, the macro cpu_to_le{16,32} unfolds to __swab{16,32}
which provides special case for constants. In little endian cases,
__constant_cpu_to_le{16,32} and cpu_to_le{16,32} expand directly to
the same expression. So, replace __constant_cpu_to_le{16,32} with
cpu_to_le{16,32} with the goal of getting rid of the definition of
__constant_cpu_to_le{16,32} completely.

The semantic patch that performs this transformation is as follows:

@@expression x;@@

(
- __constant_cpu_to_le16(x)
+ cpu_to_le16(x)
|
- __constant_cpu_to_le32(x)
+ cpu_to_le32(x)
)
