arm64: spinlock: fix ll/sc unlock on big-endian systems

When unlocking a spinlock, we perform a read-modify-write on the owner
ticket in order to increment it and store it back with release
semantics.

In the LL/SC case, we load the 16-bit ticket using a 32-bit load and
therefore store back the wrong halfword on a big-endian system,
corrupting the lock after the first unlock and killing the system dead.

This patch fixes the unlock code to use 16-bit accessors consistently.
