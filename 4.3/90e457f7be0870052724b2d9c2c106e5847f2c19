perf tools: Add Intel PT support

Add support for Intel Processor Trace.

Intel PT support fits within the new auxtrace infrastructure.  Recording
is supporting by identifying the Intel PT PMU, parsing options and
setting up events.

Decoding is supported by queuing up trace data by cpu or thread and then
decoding synchronously delivering synthesized event samples into the
session processing for tools to consume.
