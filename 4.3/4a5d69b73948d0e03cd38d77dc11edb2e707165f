KVM: arm: use GIC support unconditionally

The vgic code on ARM is built for all configurations that enable KVM,
but the parent_data field that it references is only present when
CONFIG_IRQ_DOMAIN_HIERARCHY is set:

virt/kvm/arm/vgic.c: In function 'kvm_vgic_map_phys_irq':
virt/kvm/arm/vgic.c:1781:13: error: 'struct irq_data' has no member named 'parent_data'

This flag is implied by the GIC driver, and indeed the VGIC code only
makes sense if a GIC is present. This changes the CONFIG_KVM symbol
to always select GIC, which avoids the issue.
