netfilter: move tee_active to core

This prepares for a TEE like expression in nftables.
We want to ensure only one duplicate is sent, so both will
use the same percpu variable to detect duplication.

The other use case is detection of recursive call to xtables, but since
we don't want dependency from nft to xtables core its put into core.c
instead of the x_tables core.
