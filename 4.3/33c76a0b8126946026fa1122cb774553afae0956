arm64: KVM: Optimize arm64 skip 30-50% vfp/simd save/restore on exits

This patch only saves and restores FP/SIMD registers on Guest access. To do
this cptr_el2 FP/SIMD trap is set on Guest entry and later checked on exit.
lmbench, hackbench show significant improvements, for 30-50% exits FP/SIMD
context is not saved/restored

[chazy/maz: fixed save/restore logic for 32bit guests]
