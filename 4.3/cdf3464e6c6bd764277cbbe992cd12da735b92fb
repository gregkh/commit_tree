ipv6: Fix dst_entry refcnt bugs in ip6_tunnel

Problems in the current dst_entry cache in the ip6_tunnel:

1. ip6_tnl_dst_set is racy.  There is no lock to protect it:
   - One major problem is that the dst refcnt gets messed up. F.e.
     the same dst_cache can be released multiple times and then
     triggering the infamous dst refcnt < 0 warning message.
   - Another issue is the inconsistency between dst_cache and
     dst_cookie.

   It can be reproduced by adding and removing the ip6gre tunnel
   while running a super_netperf TCP_CRR test.

2. ip6_tnl_dst_get does not take the dst refcnt before returning
   the dst.

This patch:
1. Create a percpu dst_entry cache in ip6_tnl
2. Use a spinlock to protect the dst_cache operations
3. ip6_tnl_dst_get always takes the dst refcnt before returning
