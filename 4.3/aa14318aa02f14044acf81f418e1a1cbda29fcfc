DT: leds: Improve description of flash LEDs related properties

1. Since max-microamp property has had no users so far, then rename
   it to more descriptive led-max-microamp.
2. Since flash-timeout-us property has had no users so far, then rename
   it to more accurate flash-max-timeout-us.
3. Describe led-max-microamp property as mandatory for specific board
   configurations.
4. Make flash-max-microamp and flash-max-timeout-us properties mandatory
   for devices with configurable flash current and flash timeout settings
   respectively.
