netfilter: Per network namespace netfilter hooks.

- Add a new set of functions for registering and unregistering per
  network namespace hooks.

- Modify the old global namespace hook functions to use the per
  network namespace hooks in their implementation, so their remains a
  single list that needs to be walked for any hook (this is important
  for keeping the hook priority working and for keeping the code
  walking the hooks simple).

- Only allow registering the per netdevice hooks in the network
  namespace where the network device lives.

- Dynamically allocate the structures in the per network namespace
  hook list in nf_register_net_hook, and unregister them in
  nf_unregister_net_hook.

  Dynamic allocate is required somewhere as the number of network
  namespaces are not fixed so we might as well allocate them in the
  registration function.

  The chain of registered hooks on any list is expected to be small so
  the cost of walking that list to find the entry we are unregistering
  should also be small.

  Performing the management of the dynamically allocated list entries
  in the registration and unregistration functions keeps the complexity
  from spreading.
