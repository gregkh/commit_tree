target: Drop iSCSI use of mutex around max_cmd_sn increment

In a performance profile, taking a mutex in iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn()
shows up very high.  However taking a mutex around "sess->max_cmd_sn += 1"
seems pretty silly: we're not serializing against other contexts in
any useful way.

I did a quick audit and there don't appear to be any other places that
use max_cmd_sn within the mutex more than once, so this lock can't be
providing any useful serialization.

(Get correct values for logging - fix whitespace damage)
