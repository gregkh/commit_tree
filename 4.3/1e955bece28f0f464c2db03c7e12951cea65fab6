mfd: stmpe: Add OF match table

The Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/stmpe.txt DT binding doc lists
"st,stmpe[610|801|811|1601|2401|2403]" as valid compatible strings but
the corresponding driver does not have an OF match table. Add the table
to the driver so the SPI core can do an OF style match.
