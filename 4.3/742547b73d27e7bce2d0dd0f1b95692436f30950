drm/fb_helper: Create wrappers for blit, copyarea and fillrect funcs

drm drivers that emulate fbdev populate their fb_fillrect, fb_copyarea
and fb_imageblit fb_ops with the help of cfb_* or sys_* fbdev core
helper functions.

Create drm_fb_helper functions that wrap around these calls.

This is part of an effort to prevent drm drivers from calling fbdev
functions directly, in order to make fbdev emulation a top level drm
option.

v3:
- Fixed kerneldoc errors

v2:
- Added kerneldocs
- Follow the drm way of aligning of arguments in func definitions
- Remove unnecessary checks for non NULL fb_info
