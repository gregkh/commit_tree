ocfs2: use 64bit variables to track heartbeat time

o2hb_elapsed_msecs computes the time taken for a disk heartbeat.
'struct timeval' variables are used to store start and end times.  On
32-bit systems, the 'tv_sec' component of 'struct timeval' will overflow
in year 2038 and beyond.

This patch solves the overflow with the following:

1. Replace o2hb_elapsed_msecs using 'ktime_t' values to measure start
   and end time, and built-in function 'ktime_ms_delta' to compute the
   elapsed time.  ktime_get_real() is used since the code prints out the
   wallclock time.

2. Changes format string to print time as a single 64-bit nanoseconds
   value ("%lld") instead of seconds and microseconds.  This simplifies
   the code since converting ktime_t to that format would need expensive
   computation.  However, the debug log string is less readable than the
   previous format.
