bpf tools: Load eBPF programs in object files into kernel

This patch utilizes previous introduced bpf_load_program to load
programs in the ELF file into kernel. Result is stored in 'fd' field in
'struct bpf_program'.

During loading, it allocs a log buffer and free it before return.  Note
that that buffer is not passed to bpf_load_program() if the first
loading try is successful. Doesn't use a statically allocated log buffer
to avoid potention multi-thread problem.

Instructions collected during opening is cleared after loading.

load_program() is created for loading a 'struct bpf_insn' array into
kernel, bpf_program__load() calls it. By this design we have a function
loads instructions into kernel. It will be used by further patches,
which creates different instances from a program and load them into
kernel.
