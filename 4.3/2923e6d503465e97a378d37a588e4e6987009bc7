powerpc: Drop unused syscall_get_error()

syscall_get_error() is unused, and never has been.

It's also probably wrong, as it negates r3 before returning it, but that
depends on what the caller is expecting.

It also doesn't deal with compat, and doesn't deal with TIF_NOERROR.

Although we could fix those, until it has a caller and it's clear what
semantics the caller wants it's just untested code. So drop it.
