MIPS: BPF: Fix load delay slots.

The entire bpf_jit_asm.S is written in noreorder mode because "we know
better" according to a comment.  This also prevented the assembler from
throwing in the required NOPs for MIPS I processors which have no
load-use interlock, thus the load's consumer might end up using the
old value of the register from prior to the load.

Fixed by putting the assembler in reorder mode for just the affected
load instructions.  This is not enough for gas to actually try to be
clever by looking at the next instruction and inserting a nop only
when needed but as the comment said "we know better", so getting gas
to unconditionally emit a NOP is just right in this case and prevents
adding further ifdefery.
