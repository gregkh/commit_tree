KVM: s390: VCPU_EVENT cleanup for prefix changes

SPX (SET PREFIX)  and SIGP (Set prefix) can change the prefix
register of a CPU. As sigp set prefix may be handled in user
space (KVM_CAP_S390_USER_SIGP), we would not log the changes
triggered via SIGP in that case. Let's have just one VCPU_EVENT
at the central location that tracks prefix changes.
