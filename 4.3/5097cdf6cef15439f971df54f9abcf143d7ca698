xen: split counting of extra memory pages from remapping

Memory pages in the initial memory setup done by the Xen hypervisor
conflicting with the target E820 map are remapped. In order to do this
those pages are counted and remapped in xen_set_identity_and_remap().

Split the counting from the remapping operation to be able to setup
the needed memory sizes in time but doing the remap operation at a
later time. This enables us to simplify the interface to
xen_set_identity_and_remap() as the number of remapped and released
pages is no longer needed here.

Finally move the remapping further down to prepare relocating
conflicting memory contents before the memory might be clobbered by
xen_set_identity_and_remap(). This requires to not destroy the Xen
E820 map when the one for the system is being constructed.
