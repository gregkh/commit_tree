cxlflash: Remove unused variable from queuecommand

The queuecommand routine has a local dev pointer used for the
dev_* prints. The two prints that currently exist are tucked
under a debug define and thus can be left out. Use the actual
location instead of a local to avoid this warning.

This patch is intended to be applied after the "CXL Flash Error
Recovery and Superpipe" series.
