intel_pstate: fix PCT_TO_HWP macro

PCT_TO_HWP does not take the actual range of pstates exported
by HWP_CAPABILITIES in account, and is broken on most platforms.
Remove the macro and set the min and max pstate for hwp by
determining the range and adjusting by the min and max percent
limits values.
