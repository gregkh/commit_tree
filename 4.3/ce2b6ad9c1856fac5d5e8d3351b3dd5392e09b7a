s390/bpf: increase BPF_SIZE_MAX

Currently we have the restriction that jitted BPF programs can
have a maximum size of one page. The reason is that we use short
displacements for the literal pool.

The 20 bit displacements are available since z990 and BPF requires
z196 as minimum. Therefore we can remove this restriction and use
everywhere 20 bit signed long displacements.
