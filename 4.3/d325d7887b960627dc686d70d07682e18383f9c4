perf tools: Auto detecting kernel build directory

This patch detects kernel build directory by checking the existence of
include/generated/autoconf.h.

clang working directory is changed to kbuild directory if it is found,
to help user use relative include path. Following patch will detect
kernel include directory, which contains relative include patch so this
workdir changing is needed.

Users are allowed to set 'kbuild-dir = ""' manually to disable this
checking.
