tipc: move protocol message sending away from link FSM

The implementation of the link FSM currently takes decisions about and
sends out link protocol messages. This is unnecessary, since such
actions are not the result of any link state change, and are even
decided based on non-FSM state information ("silent_intv_cnt").

We now move the sending of unicast link protocol messages to the
function tipc_link_timeout(), and the initial broadcast synchronization
message to tipc_node_link_up(). The latter is done because a link
instance should not need to know whether it is the first or second
link to a destination. Such information is now restricted to and
handled by the link aggregation layer in node.c
