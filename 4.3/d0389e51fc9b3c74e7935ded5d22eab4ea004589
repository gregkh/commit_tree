i40e/i40evf: Add stats to track FD ATR and SB dynamic enable state

Since the driver can dynamically enable/disable FD ATR and SB features,
these stats help keep track of the current state and along with
fd_flush count provide a means to debug what could be going on
with the flow director filters. This will take away the need for
being verbose in our debug logs with respect to FD.
