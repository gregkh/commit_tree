clockevents/drivers/dummy_timer: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate dummy_timer driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

We weren't doing anything in the ->set_mode() callback. So, this patch
doesn't provide any set-state callbacks.
