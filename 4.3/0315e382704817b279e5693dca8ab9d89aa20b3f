net: Fix behaviour of unreachable, blackhole and prohibit routes

Man page of ip-route(8) says following about route types:

  unreachable - these destinations are unreachable.  Packets are dis‐
  carded and the ICMP message host unreachable is generated.  The local
  senders get an EHOSTUNREACH error.

  blackhole - these destinations are unreachable.  Packets are dis‐
  carded silently.  The local senders get an EINVAL error.

  prohibit - these destinations are unreachable.  Packets are discarded
  and the ICMP message communication administratively prohibited is
  generated.  The local senders get an EACCES error.

In the inet6 address family, this was correct, except the local senders
got ENETUNREACH error instead of EHOSTUNREACH in case of unreachable route.
In the inet address family, all three route types generated ICMP message
net unreachable, and the local senders got ENETUNREACH error.

In both address families all three route types now behave consistently
with documentation.
