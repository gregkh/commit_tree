dm snapshot: add new persistent store option to support overflow

Commit 76c44f6d80 introduced the possibly for "Overflow" to be reported
by the snapshot device's status.  Older userspace (e.g. lvm2) does not
handle the "Overflow" status response.

Fix this incompatibility by requiring newer userspace code, that can
cope with "Overflow", request the persistent store with overflow support
by using "PO" (Persistent with Overflow) for the snapshot store type.
