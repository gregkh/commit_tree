perf/x86/intel/lbr: Limit LBR accesses to TOS in callstack mode

In callstack mode the LBR is not a ring buffer, but a stack that grows up
and down. This means in  this case we don't need to access all LBRs, only the
ones up to TOS. Do this optimization for the normal LBR read, and the context
switch save/restore code. For save/restore it can be done unconditionally, as
it only runs when call stack mode is active.

This recovers some of the cost of going to 32 LBRs on Skylake.
