cpufreq: powernv: Restore cpu frequency to policy->cur on unthrottling

If frequency is throttled due to OCC reset then cpus will be in Psafe
frequency, so restore the frequency on all cpus to policy->cur when
OCCs are active again. And if frequency is throttled due to Pmax
capping then restore the frequency of all the cpus  in the chip on
unthrottling.
