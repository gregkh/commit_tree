dm btree: fix leak of bufio-backed block in btree_split_beneath error path

btree_split_beneath()'s error path had an outstanding FIXME that speaks
directly to the potential for _not_ cleaning up a previously allocated
bufio-backed block.

Fix this by releasing the previously allocated bufio block using
unlock_block().
