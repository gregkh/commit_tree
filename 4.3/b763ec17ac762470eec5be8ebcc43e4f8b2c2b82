regmap: debugfs: Ensure we don't underflow when printing access masks

If a read is attempted which is smaller than the line length then we may
underflow the subtraction we're doing with the unsigned size_t type so
move some of the calculation to be additions on the right hand side
instead in order to avoid this.
