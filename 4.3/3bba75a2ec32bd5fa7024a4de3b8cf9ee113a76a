clk: rockchip: Add pclk_peri to critical clocks on RK3066/RK3188

Now that the rockchip clock subsystem does clock gating with GPIO banks,
these are no longer enabled once during probe and no longer stay enabled
for eternity. When all these clocks are disabled, the parent clock pclk_peri
might be disabled too, as no other child claims it. So, we need to add pclk_peri
to the critical clocks.
