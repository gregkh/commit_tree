drm/i915: Unconditionally do fb tracking invalidate in set_domain

We can't elide the fb tracking invalidate if the buffer is already in
the right domain since that would lead to missed screen updates. I'm
pretty sure I've written this already before but must have gotten lost
unfortunately :(

v2: Chris observed that all internal set_domain users already
correctly do the fb invalidate on their own, hence we can move this
just into the set_domain ioctl instead.

v3: I screwed up setting the invalidate ORIGIN_* correctly (Chris).
