mm: fix status code which move_pages() returns for zero page

The manpage for move_pages(2) specifies that status code for zero page is
supposed to be -EFAULT.  Currently kernel return -ENOENT in this case.

follow_page() can do it for us, if we would ask for FOLL_DUMP.  The use of
FOLL_DUMP also means that the upper layer page tables pages are no longer
allocated.
