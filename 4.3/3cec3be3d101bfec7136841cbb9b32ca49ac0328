ath10k: handle 10.4 firmware wmi swba event

10.4 firmware swba event payload has space to accommodate upto
512 client traffic indication info & one p2p noa descriptor.
It's is not matching with exiting swba event format defined for
non 10.4 firmware. Non 10.4 firmware swba event format is designed
to support only upto only 128 client and four p2p notice of absence
descriptor.

following changes are done in this patch to enable ath10k to handle
10.4 firmware swba event,

 - link generic ath10k_wmi_event_host_swba() to handle 10.4 swba
   event in 10.4 wmi rx handler.

 - add 10.4 specific swba event structure wmi_10_4_host_swba_event.

 - new function ath10k_wmi_10_4_op_pull_swba_ev() to parse
   10.4 swba event.

 - increase tim_bitmap[] size in ath10k_vif to 64 to hold 512 station
   power save state.
