drm/i915: Set alternate aux for DDI-E

There is no correspondent Aux channel for DDI-E.

So we need to rely on VBT to let us know witch one
is being used instead.

v2: Removing some trailing spaces and giving proper
credit to Xiong that added a nice way to avoid port
conflicts by setting supports_dp = 0 when using
equivalent aux for DDI-E.
