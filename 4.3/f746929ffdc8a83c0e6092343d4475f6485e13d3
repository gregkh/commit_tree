Revert "ARM: OMAP4: remove dead kconfig option OMAP4_ERRATA_I688"

This reverts commit 606da4826b89b044b51e3a84958b802204cfe4c7.

We actually need this code for proper behaviour of OMAP4, and it needs
fixing a different way other than just removing the code.  Disabling
code which is necessary in the hopes of persuing multiplatform kernels
is a stupid approach.
