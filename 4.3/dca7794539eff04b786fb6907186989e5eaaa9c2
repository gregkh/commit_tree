xhci: change xhci 1.0 only restrictions to support xhci 1.1

Some changes between xhci 0.96 and xhci 1.0 specifications forced us to
check the hci version in code, some of these checks were implemented as
hci_version == 1.0, which will not work with new xhci 1.1 controllers.

xhci 1.1 behaves similar to xhci 1.0 in these cases, so change these
checks to hci_version >= 1.0
