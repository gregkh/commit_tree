genirq: Fix race in register_irq_proc()

Per-IRQ directories in procfs are created only when a handler is first
added to the irqdesc, not when the irqdesc is created.  In the case of
a shared IRQ, multiple tasks can race to create a directory.  This
race condition seems to have been present forever, but is easier to
hit with async probing.
