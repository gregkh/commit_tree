nohz: Remove idle task special case

On nohz full early days, idle dynticks and full dynticks weren't well
integrated and we couldn't risk full dynticks calls on idle without
risking messing up tick idle statistics. This is why we prevented such
thing to happen.

Nowadays full dynticks and idle dynticks are better integrated and
interact without known issue.

So lets remove that.
