wil6210: allow to handle Rx on 2 cores

Allow network stack part of Rx processing to run on separate core,
relaxing CPU utilization on the core used for Rx NAPI.

If RXHASH feature is enabled, the driver sets rxhash of each skb to 1
to enable RPS. The core for processing the rx skb is determined by RPS
mechanism according to rx_cpus bit mask which is configured at user level.
For processing skbs on different core from the core which processes
the interrupts, it is recommended not to enable core 0 in rx_cpus bit mask.
