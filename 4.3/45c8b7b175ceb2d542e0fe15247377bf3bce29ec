tipc: allow non-linear first fragment buffer

The current code for message reassembly is erroneously assuming that
the the first arriving fragment buffer always is linear, and then goes
ahead resetting the fragment list of that buffer in anticipation of
more arriving fragments.

However, if the buffer already happens to be non-linear, we will
inadvertently drop the already attached fragment list, and later
on trig a BUG() in __pskb_pull_tail().

We see this happen when running fragmented TIPC multicast across UDP,
something made possible since
commit d0f91938bede ("tipc: add ip/udp media type")

We fix this by not resetting the fragment list when the buffer is non-
linear, and by initiatlizing our private fragment list tail pointer to
the tail of the existing fragment list.
