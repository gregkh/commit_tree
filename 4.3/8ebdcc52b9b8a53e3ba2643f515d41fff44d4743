hv_netvsc: Set vRSS with num_chn in RNDIS filter

Uses device_info->num_chn to pass user provided number of vRSS
queues (from ethtool --set-channels) to rndis_filter_device_add. If
nonzero and less than the maximum, set net_device->num_chn to the given
value; else default to prior algorithm.

Always initialize struct device_info to 0, otherwise not all its fields
are guaranteed to be 0, which is necessary when checking if num_chn has
been purposefully set.
