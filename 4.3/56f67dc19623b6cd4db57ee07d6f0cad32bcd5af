drm/nouveau/tmr: type-safe PTIMER-based delay/wait macros

These require an explicit struct nvkm_device pointer, unlike the previous
macros which take a void *, and work for (almost) anything derived from
nvkm_object by using some heuristics.

These macros are more general than the previous ones, and can be used to
handle PTIMER-based busy-waits (will be used in later devinit fixes) as
well as more complicated wait conditions.
