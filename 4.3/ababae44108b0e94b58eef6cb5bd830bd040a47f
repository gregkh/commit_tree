x86/ioapic: Prevent NULL pointer dereference in setup_ioapic_dest()

Commit 4857c91f0d19 changed the way how irq affinity is setup in
setup_ioapic_dest() from using the core helper function to
unconditionally calling the irq_set_affinity() callback of the
underlying irq chip.

That results in a NULL pointer dereference for the rare case where the
underlying irq chip is lapic_chip which has no irq_set_affinity()
callback. lapic_chip is occasionally used for the timer interrupt (irq
0).

The fix is simple: Check the availability of the callback instead of
calling it unconditionally.
