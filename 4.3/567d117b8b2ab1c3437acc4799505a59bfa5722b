mm/memblock.c: rename local variable of memblock_type to 'type'

Since commit e3239ff92a17 ("memblock: Rename memblock_region to
memblock_type and memblock_property to memblock_region"), all local
variables of the membock_type type were renamed to 'type'.  This commit
renames all remaining local variables with the memblock_type type to the
same view.
