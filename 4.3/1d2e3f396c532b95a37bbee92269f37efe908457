RDS: restore return value in rds_cmsg_rdma_args()

In rds_cmsg_rdma_args() 'ret' is used by rds_pin_pages() which returns
number of pinned pages on success. And the same value is returned to the
caller of rds_cmsg_rdma_args() on success which is not intended.

Commit f4a3fc03c1d7 ("RDS: Clean up error handling in rds_cmsg_rdma_args")
removed the 'ret = 0' line which broke RDS RDMA mode.

Fix it by restoring the return value on rds_pin_pages() success
keeping the clean-up in place.
