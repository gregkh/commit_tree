s390/sclp_vt220: support magic sysrequests

Implement magic sysrequest handling for the VT220 terminal (also known as
the Integrated ASCII console on the HMC/SE).
To invoke a "magic sysrequest" function, press "Ctrl+o" followed by a
second character that designates the debugging function.

The handling of the sysrq is scheduled away from the SCLP IRQ context;
because large amounts of sysrq output might fill up the console buffers.
The console might deadlock because it cannot empty the buffers while still
in the receiving IRQ context.  This behavior is the same as for the SCLP
console.
