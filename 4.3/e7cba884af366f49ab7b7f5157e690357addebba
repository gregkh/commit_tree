rtc: Drop (un)likely before IS_ERR(_OR_NULL)

IS_ERR(_OR_NULL) already contain an 'unlikely' compiler flag and there
is no need to do that again from its callers. Drop it.

gemini driver was using likely() for a failure case while the rtc driver
is getting registered. That looks wrong and it should really be
unlikely. But because we are killing all the unlikely() flags, lets kill
that too.
