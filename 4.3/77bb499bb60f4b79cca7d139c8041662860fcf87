pagemap: add mmap-exclusive bit for marking pages mapped only here

This patch sets bit 56 in pagemap if this page is mapped only once.  It
allows to detect exclusively used pages without exposing PFN:

present file exclusive state
0       0    0         non-present
1       1    0         file page mapped somewhere else
1       1    1         file page mapped only here
1       0    0         anon non-CoWed page (shared with parent/child)
1       0    1         anon CoWed page (or never forked)

CoWed pages in (MAP_FILE | MAP_PRIVATE) areas are anon in this context.

MMap-exclusive bit doesn't reflect potential page-sharing via swapcache:
page could be mapped once but has several swap-ptes which point to it.
Application could detect that by swap bit in pagemap entry and touch that
pte via /proc/pid/mem to get real information.
