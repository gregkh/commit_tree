be2net: Revert "make the RX_FILTER command asynchronous" commit

The be_cmd_rx_filter() routine sends a non-embedded cmd to the FW and used
a pre-allocated dma memory to hold the cmd payload. This worked fine when
this cmd was synchronous. This cmd was changed to asynchronous mode by the
commit 8af65c2f4("make the RX_FILTER command asynchronous"). So now when
there are two quick invocations of this cmd, the 2nd request may end up
overwriting the first request, causing FW cmd corruption.

This patch reverts the offending commit and hence fixes the regression.
