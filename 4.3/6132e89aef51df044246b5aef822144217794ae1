clk: atlas7: fix integer overflow in dto rate calculation

I cannot believe that I spend quite a lot time in finding this bug.
It seems a pitfall people tend to fall in.

In "int64 = int32 * int32", conversion from 32-bits to 64-bits comes
after the multiplication. So this statement may not work as expected.
