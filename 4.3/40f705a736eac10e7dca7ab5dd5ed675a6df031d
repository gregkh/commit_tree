fs: Don't dump core if the corefile would become world-readable.

On a filesystem like vfat, all files are created with the same owner
and mode independent of who created the file. When a vfat filesystem
is mounted with root as owner of all files and read access for everyone,
root's processes left world-readable coredumps on it (but other
users' processes only left empty corefiles when given write access
because of the uid mismatch).

Given that the old behavior was inconsistent and insecure, I don't see
a problem with changing it. Now, all processes refuse to dump core unless
the resulting corefile will only be readable by their owner.
