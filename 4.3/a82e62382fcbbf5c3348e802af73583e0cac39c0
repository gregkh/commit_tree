arm64: atomics: tidy up common atomic{,64}_* macros

The common (i.e. identical for ll/sc and lse) atomic macros in atomic.h
are needlessley different for atomic_t and atomic64_t.

This patch tidies up the definitions to make them consistent across the
two atomic types and factors out common code such as the add_unless
implementation based on cmpxchg.
