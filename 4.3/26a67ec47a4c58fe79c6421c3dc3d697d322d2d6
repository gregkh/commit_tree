spi: Fix regression in spi-bitbang-txrx.h

This patch fixes a regression introduced by commit 232a5adc5199 ("spi:
bitbang: only toggle bitchanges"). The attempt to optimize writes of
consecutive bit patterns broke most of the combinations of word size
and SPI modes due to selecting the wrong bit as the MSB value.
