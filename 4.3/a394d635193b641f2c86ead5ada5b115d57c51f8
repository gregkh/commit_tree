spi: Fix documentation of spi_alloc_master()

Actually, spi_master_put() after spi_alloc_master() must _not_ be followed
by kfree(). The memory is already freed with the call to spi_master_put()
through spi_master_class, which registers a release function. Calling both
spi_master_put() and kfree() results in often nasty (and delayed) crashes
elsewhere in the kernel, often in the networking stack.

This reverts commit eb4af0f5349235df2e4a5057a72fc8962d00308a.

Alexey Klimov: This revert becomes valid after
94c69f765f1b4a658d96905ec59928e3e3e07e6a when spi-imx.c
has been fixed and there is no need to call kfree() so comment
for spi_alloc_master() should be fixed.
