clocksource/drivers/prima2: Prevent ftrace recursion

Currently prima2 timer can be used as a scheduler clock. We properly
marked sirfsoc_read_sched_clock() as notrace but we then call another
function sirfsoc_timer_read() that _wasn't_ notrace.

Having a traceable function in the sched_clock() path leads to a recursion
within ftrace and a kernel crash.

Fix this by adding notrace attribute to the sirfsoc_timer_read() function.
