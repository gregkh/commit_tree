ARM: orion: Fix DSA platform device after mvmdio conversion

DSA expects the host_dev pointer to be the device structure associated
with the MDIO bus controller driver. First commit breaking that was
c3a07134e6aa ("mv643xx_eth: convert to use the Marvell Orion MDIO
driver"), and then, it got completely under the radar for a while.
