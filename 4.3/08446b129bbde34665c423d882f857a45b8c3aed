ARM: mm: improve do_ldrd_abort macro

Improve the do_ldrd_abort macro code - firstly, it inefficiently checks
for the LDRD encoding by doing a multi-stage test of various bits.  This
can be simplified by generating a mask, bitmasking the instruction and
then comparing the result.

Secondly, we want to be able to test the result rather than branching
to do_DataAbort, so remove the branch at the end and rename the macro
to 'teq_ldrd' to reflect it's new usage.  teq_ldrd macro returns 'eq'
if the instruction was a LDRD.
