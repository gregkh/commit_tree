mm, compaction: skip compound pages by order in free scanner

The compaction free scanner is looking for PageBuddy() pages and
skipping all others.  For large compound pages such as THP or hugetlbfs,
we can save a lot of iterations if we skip them at once using their
compound_order().  This is generally unsafe and we can read a bogus
value of order due to a race, but if we are careful, the only danger is
skipping too much.

When tested with stress-highalloc from mmtests on 4GB system with 1GB
hugetlbfs pages, the vmstat compact_free_scanned count decreased by at
least 15%.
