rcu: Shut up bogus gcc array bounds warning

Because gcc does not realize a loop would not be entered ever
(i.e. in case of rcu_num_lvls == 1):

  for (i = 1; i < rcu_num_lvls; i++)
	  rsp->level[i] = rsp->level[i - 1] + levelcnt[i - 1];

some compiler (pre- 5.x?) versions give a bogus warning:

  kernel/rcu/tree.c: In function ‘rcu_init_one.isra.55’:
  kernel/rcu/tree.c:4108:13: warning: array subscript is above array bounds [-Warray-bounds]
     rsp->level[i] = rsp->level[i - 1] + rsp->levelcnt[i - 1];
               ^
Fix that warning by adding an extra item to rcu_state::level[]
array. Once the bogus warning is fixed in gcc and kernel drops
support of older versions, the dummy item may be removed from
the array.
