mm/page_alloc.c: change sysctl_lower_zone_reserve_ratio to sysctl_lowmem_reserve_ratio in comments

We use sysctl_lowmem_reserve_ratio rather than
sysctl_lower_zone_reserve_ratio to determine how aggressive the kernel
is in defending lowmem from the possibility of being captured into
pinned user memory.  To avoid misleading, correct it in some comments.
