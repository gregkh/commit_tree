xen-blkfront: check for null drvdata in blkback_changed (XenbusStateClosing)

xen-blkfront will crash if the check to talk_to_blkback()
in blkback_changed()(XenbusStateInitWait) returns an error.
The driver data is freed and info is set to NULL. Later during
the close process via talk_to_blkback's call to xenbus_dev_fatal()
the null pointer is passed to and dereference in blkfront_closing.
