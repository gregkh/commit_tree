drm/i915: don't increment the FBC threshold at fbc_enable

We first set the threshold value when we're allocating the CFB, and
then later at {ilk,gen7}_fbc_enable() we increment it in case we're
using 16bpp. While that is correct, it is dangerous: if we rework the
code a little bit in a way that allows us to call intel_fbc_enable()
without necessarily calling i915_gem_stolen_setup_compression() first,
we might end up incrementing threshold more than once. To prevent
that, increment a temporary variable instead.

v2: Rebase.
