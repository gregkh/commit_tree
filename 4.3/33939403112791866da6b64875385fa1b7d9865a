ARM: rockchip: restore dapswjdp after suspend

In the commit (0ea001d ARM: rockchip: disable dapswjdp during suspend)
we made the assumption that we didn't need to restore dapswjdp after
suspend because "the MASKROM will enable it back".

It turns out that's not a safe assumption.  In some cases (pending
interrupts) it's possible that the WFI might act as a no-op and the
MaskROM will never run.  Since we're changing the bit, we should
restore it ourselves.
