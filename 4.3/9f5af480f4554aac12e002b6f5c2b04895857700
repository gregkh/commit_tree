checkpatch: improve SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT test

Many lines exist like

	if (foo)
			bar;

where the tabbed indentation of the branch is not one more than the "if"
line above it.

checkpatch should emit a warning on those lines.

Miscellenea:

o Remove comments from branch blocks
o Skip blank lines in block
