serial: sirf: let uart's receive start in right place

While UART work in DMA mode, function start_rx will request descriptor
from DMA engine, if there is no left descriptor UART, driver will give
err logs "DMA slave single fail".

currently start_rx is called in set_termios function, so everytime, port
setting will call start_rx once.

Now put start_rx in startup, it will be called once while open the port.
