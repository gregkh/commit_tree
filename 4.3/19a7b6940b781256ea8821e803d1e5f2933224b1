gpio: brcmstb: Add interrupt and wakeup source support

Uses the gpiolib irqchip helpers.  For this to work, the irq setup
function is called once per bank instead of once per device.  Note
that all known uses of this block have a BCM7120 L2 interrupt
controller as a parent.  Supports interrupts for all GPIOs.

In the IRQ handler, we check for raised IRQs for invalid GPIOs and
warn (ratelimited) if they're encountered.

Also, several drivers (e.g. gpio-keys) allow for GPIOs to be
configured as wakeup sources, and this GPIO controller supports that
through a separate interrupt path.

The de-facto standard DT property "wakeup-source" is checked, since
that indicates whether the GPIO controller hardware can wake.  Uses
the IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND irq_chip flag because UPG GIO doesn't have
any of its own wakeup source configuration.

Aside regarding gpiolib irqchip helpers: It wasn't obvious (to me)
that you can have multiple chained irqchips and associated IRQ domains
for a single parent IRQ, and as long as the xlate function is written
correctly, a GPIO IRQ request end up checking the correct domain and
will get associated with the correct IRQ.  What helps make this clear
is to read
  drivers/gpio/gpiolib-of.c:
   - of_gpiochip_find_and_xlate()
   - of_get_named_gpiod_flags()
  drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:
   - gpiochip_find()
