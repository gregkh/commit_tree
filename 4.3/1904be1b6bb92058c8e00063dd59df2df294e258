tracing: Do not allow stack_tracer to record stack in NMI

The code in stack tracer should not be executed within an NMI as it grabs
spinlocks and stack tracing an NMI gives the possibility of causing a
deadlock. Although this is safe on x86_64, because it does not perform stack
traces when the task struct stack is not in use (interrupts and NMIs), it
may be an issue for NMIs on i386 and other archs that use the same stack as
the NMI.
