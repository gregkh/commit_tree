document rwsem_release() in sb_wait_write()

Not only we need to avoid the warning from lockdep_sys_exit(), the
caller of freeze_super() can never release this lock. Another thread
can do this, so there is another reason for rwsem_release().

Plus the comment should explain why we have to fool lockdep.
