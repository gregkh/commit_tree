Partially revert "drm/i915: s/mdelay/msleep/" in ilk rps code

This reverts commit 6adfb1ef106bfe4b5ecb8bd75c4d037741d28a48.

Ironlake RPS code runs under an irqsave spinlock and hence sleeping
isn't allowed. Not a this long delay while blocking irqs isn't great
at all, but fixing the locking scheme is a lot more involved.

So just revert for now.
