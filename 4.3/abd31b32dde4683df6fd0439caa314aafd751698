ASoC: Use card field to indicate whether a component is bound

Use the card field of a component to indicate whether it is bound or not.
This makes a certain sense given that the field contains the card the
component is bound to and a component can only be bound to one card at a
time. And it also requires to unset the card field when the component is
unbound from the card.

This makes the probded flag redundant and it can be removed.
