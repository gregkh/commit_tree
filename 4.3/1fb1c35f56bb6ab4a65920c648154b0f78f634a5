rtc: s3c: fix disabled clocks for alarm

The clock enable/disable codes for alarm have been removed from
commit 24e1455493da ("drivers/rtc/rtc-s3c.c: delete duplicate clock
control") and the clocks are disabled even if alarm is set, so alarm
interrupt can't happen.

The s3c_rtc_setaie function can be called several times with 'enabled'
argument having same value, so it needs to check whether clocks are
enabled or not.
