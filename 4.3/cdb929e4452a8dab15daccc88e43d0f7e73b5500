serial: 8250_omap: workaround errata around idling UART after using DMA

AM335x, AM437x and DRA7x SoCs have an errata[1] due to which UART
cannot be idled after it has been used with DMA.

OMAP3 has a similar sounding errata which has been worked around
in a2fc36613ac1af2e9 ("ARM: OMAP3: Use manual idle for UARTs
because of DMA errata"). But the workaround used there does not
apply to AM335x, AM437x SoCs.

After using DMA, the UART module on these SoCs must be soft reset
to go to idle.

This patch implements that errata workaround. It is expected that
UART will be used with DMA so no explicit check for DMA usage
has been added for errata applicability.

MDR1 register needs to be restored right after soft-reset because
"UART mode" must be set in that register for module wake-up on AM335x
to work. As a result, SCR register is now used to determine if
context was lost during sleep.
