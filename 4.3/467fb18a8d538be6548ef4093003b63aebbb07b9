ARM: dts: rockchip: correct regulator power states for suspend

When getting translated from a downstream device tree that used slightly
different DT bindings, these regulators got labeled with the
"on-in-suspend" state, when they were actually supposed to be turned off
for S3 suspend. This was harmless, but not intentional, AFAICT.

Let's turn them off to get the optimal power state.
