route: move lwtunnel state to dst_entry

Currently, the lwtunnel state resides in per-protocol data. This is
a problem if we encapsulate ipv6 traffic in an ipv4 tunnel (or vice versa).
The xmit function of the tunnel does not know whether the packet has been
routed to it by ipv4 or ipv6, yet it needs the lwtstate data. Moving the
lwtstate data to dst_entry makes such inter-protocol tunneling possible.

As a bonus, this brings a nice diffstat.
