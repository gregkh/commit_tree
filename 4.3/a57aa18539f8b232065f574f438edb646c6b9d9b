clk: Silence warnings about lock imbalances

The recursive spinlock implementation trips up sparse and it
complains that these functions have lock imbalances. That isn't
really true though, so add some __acquires() and __releases()
information so that sparse is quiet.

drivers/clk/clk.c:116:22: warning: context imbalance in 'clk_enable_lock' - wrong count at exit
drivers/clk/clk.c:141:9: warning: context imbalance in 'clk_enable_unlock' - unexpected unlock
