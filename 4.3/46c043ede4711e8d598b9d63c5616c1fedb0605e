mm: take i_mmap_lock in unmap_mapping_range() for DAX

DAX is not so special: we need i_mmap_lock to protect mapping->i_mmap.

__dax_pmd_fault() uses unmap_mapping_range() shoot out zero page from
all mappings.  We need to drop i_mmap_lock there to avoid lock deadlock.

Re-aquiring the lock should be fine since we check i_size after the
point.
