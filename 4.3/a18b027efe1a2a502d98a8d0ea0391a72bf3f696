perf top: Add branch annotation code to top

Now that we can process branch data in annotate it makes sense to
support enabling branch recording from top too. Most of the code needed
for this is already in shared code with report. But we need to add:

- The option parsing code (using shared code from the previous patch)
- Document the options
- Set up the IPC/cycles accounting state in the top session
- Call the accounting code in the hist iter callback
