fjes: Introduce FUJITSU Extended Socket Network Device driver

This patch adds the basic code of FUJITSU Extended Socket
Network Device driver.

When "PNP0C02" is found in ACPI DSDT, it evaluates "_STR"
to check if "PNP0C02" is for Extended Socket device driver
and retrieves ACPI resource information. Then creates
platform_device.
