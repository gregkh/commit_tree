drm/i915: Add flag to i915_add_request() to skip the cache flush

In order to explcitly track all GPU work (and completely remove the outstanding
lazy request), it is necessary to add extra i915_add_request() calls to various
places. Some of these do not need the implicit cache flush done as part of the
standard batch buffer submission process.

This patch adds a flag to _add_request() to specify whether the flush is
required or not.
