usnic: add missing clauses to BSD license

The usnic_verbs kernel module was clearly marked with the following in
its code:

  MODULE_LICENSE("Dual BSD/GPL");

However, we accidentally left a few clauses of the BSD text out of the
license header in all the source files.  This commit fixes that: all
the files are properly dual BSD/GPL-licensed.  Contributors that might
have been confused by this have been contacted to get their permission
and are Cc:ed here.
