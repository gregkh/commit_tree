tipc: make resetting of links non-atomic

In order to facilitate future improvements to the locking structure, we
want to make resetting and establishing of links non-atomic. I.e., the
functions tipc_node_link_up() and tipc_node_link_down() should be called
from outside the node lock context, and grab/release the node lock
themselves. This requires that we can freeze the link state from the
moment it is set to RESETTING or PEER_RESET in one lock context until
it is set to RESET or ESTABLISHING in a later context. The recently
introduced link FSM makes this possible, so we are now ready to introduce
the above change.

This commit implements this.
