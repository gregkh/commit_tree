[media] media: am437x-vpfe: Fix a race condition during release

There was a race condition where during cleanup/release operation
on-going streaming would cause a kernel panic because the hardware
module was disabled prematurely with IRQ still pending.

Fixes: 417d2e507edc ("[media] media: platform: add VPFE capture driver support for AM437X")
