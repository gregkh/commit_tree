spi: bcm2835: BUG: fix wrong use of PAGE_MASK

There is a bug in the alignment checking of transfers,
that results in DMA not being used for un-aligned
transfers that do not cross page-boundries, which is valid.

This is due to a missconception of the meaning PAGE_MASK
when implementing that check originally - (PAGE_SIZE - 1)
should have been used instead.

Also fixes a copy/paste error.
