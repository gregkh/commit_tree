tty: Convert use of __constant_htons to htons

In little endian cases, macro htons unfolds to __swab16 which
provides special case for constants. In big endian cases,
__constant_htons and htons expand directly to the same expression.
So, replace __constant_htons with htons with the goal of getting
rid of the definition of __constant_htons completely.

The semantic patch that performs this transformation is as follows:

@@expression x;@@

- __constant_htons(x)
+ htons(x)
