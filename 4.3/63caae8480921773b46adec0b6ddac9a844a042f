sched/idle: Move latency tracing stop/start calls deeper inside the idle loop

Make sure to stop tracing only once we are past a point where
all latency tracing events have been processed (irqs are not
enabled again). This has the slight advantage of capturing more
latency related events in the idle path, but most importantly it
makes sure that latency tracing doesn't get re-enabled
inadvertently when new events are coming in.

This makes the irqsoff latency tracer useful again, as we stop
capturing CPU sleep time as IRQ latency.
