tipc: don't sanity check non-existing TLV (NL compat)

A zero length payload means that no TLV (Type Length Value) data has
been passed. Prior to this patch a non-existing TLV could be sanity
checked with TLV_OK() resulting in random behavior where a user
sending an empty message occasionally got a incorrect "operation not
supported" message back.
