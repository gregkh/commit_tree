staging: comedi: comedi_fops: remove BUG_ON() in comedi_free_subdevice_minor()

Drivers should not crash the kernel.

This function is only called by comedi_device_detach_cleanup() and the
s->minor will always be valid or the device wouldn't have attached in
the first place.

Leave the checks for safety in accessing the comedi_subdevice_minor_table
array but remove the BUG_ON() calls.
