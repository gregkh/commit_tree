clocksource/drivers/arm_global_timer: Prevent ftrace recursion

Currently arm_global_timer can be used as a scheduler clock. We properly
marked gt_sched_clock_read() as notrace but we then call another function
gt_counter_read() that _wasn't_ notrace.

Having a traceable function in the sched_clock() path leads to a recursion
within ftrace and a kernel crash.

Fix this by adding an extra notrace function to keep other users of
gt_counter_read() traceable.
