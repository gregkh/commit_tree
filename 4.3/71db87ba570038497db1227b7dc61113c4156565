bus: subsys: update return type of ->remove_dev() to void

Its return value is not used by the subsys core and nothing meaningful
can be done with it, even if we want to use it. The subsys device is
anyway getting removed.

Update prototype of ->remove_dev() to make its return type as void. Fix
all usage sites as well.
