s390/kvm: validate the floating-point control before restoring it

The kvm_arch_vcpu_load() does not validate whether the floating-point
control (FPC) is valid.  Further, the return code of the restore is not
checked too.  If the FPC is invalid, the restore fails and the host FPC
value might remain.  The correct behavior would be to clear the FPC if it
is not valid.  Hence, validate the FPC value and, optionally, reset the
value before restoring it.
