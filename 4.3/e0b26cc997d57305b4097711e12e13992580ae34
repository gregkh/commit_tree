ipvs: call rtnl_lock early

When the sync damon is started we need to hold rtnl
lock while calling ip_mc_join_group. Currently, we have
a wrong locking order because the correct one is
rtnl_lock->__ip_vs_mutex. It is implied from the usage
of __ip_vs_mutex in ip_vs_dst_event() which is called
under rtnl lock during NETDEV_* notifications.

Fix the problem by calling rtnl_lock early only for the
start_sync_thread call. As a bonus this fixes the usage
__dev_get_by_name which was not called under rtnl lock.

This patch actually extends and depends on commit 54ff9ef36bdf
("ipv4, ipv6: kill ip_mc_{join, leave}_group and
ipv6_sock_mc_{join, drop}").
