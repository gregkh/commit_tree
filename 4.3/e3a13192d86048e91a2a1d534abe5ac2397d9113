perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add support for ARB uncore PMU on Sandy/IvyBridge

Add a new "ARB" uncore PMU that is used to monitor the uncore queue
arbiter. This is useful to measure uncore queue occupancy and similar
statistics. The registers all have the same format as the
existing CBOX PMU.

Also move the event constraints from the CBOX to ARB. The 0x80+
events are ARB events and cannot be scheduled on a CBOX PMU.
