iommu/tegra-smmu: Fix unmap() method

The Tegra SMMU unmap path has several problems:
1. as_pte_put() can perform a write-after-free
2. tegra_smmu_unmap() can perform cache maintanence on a page we have
   just freed.
3. when a page table is unmapped, there is no CPU cache maintanence of
   the write clearing the page directory entry, nor is there any
   maintanence of the IOMMU to ensure that it sees the page table has
   gone.

Fix this by getting rid of as_pte_put(), and instead coding the PTE
unmap separately from the PDE unmap, placing the PDE unmap after the
PTE unmap has been completed.
