ACPICA: Tables: Fix global table list issues by removing fixed table indexes

ACPICA commit c0b38b4c3982c2336ee92a2a14716107248bd941

The fixed table indexes leave holes in the global table list:
 1. One hole can be seen when there is only 1 FACS provided by the BIOS.
 2. Tow holes can be seen when it is a reduced hardware platform.
The holes do not break OSPMs but have broken ACPI debugger "tables"
command.

Also the "fixed table indexes" mechanism may make the descriptors of the
standard tables installed earlier than DSDT to be overwritten by the
descriptors of the fixed tables. For example, FACP disappears from the
global table list after DSDT is installed.

This patch fixes all above issues by removing the "fixed table indexes"
mechanism which is too complicated to be maintained in a regression safe
manner. After removal, the table loader will determine the indexes of the
fixed tables. Lv Zheng.
