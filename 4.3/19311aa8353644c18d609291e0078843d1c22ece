nfsd: New counter for generating client confirm verifier

If using clientid_counter, it seems possible that gen_confirm could
generate the same verifier for the same client in some situations.

Add a new counter for client confirm verifier to make sure gen_confirm
generates a different verifier on each call for the same clientid.
