perf script: Initialize callchain_param.record_mode

Milian Wolff reported non functional DWARF unwind under perf script. The
reason is that perf script does not properly configure
callchain_param.record_mode, which is needed by unwind code.

Stealing the code from report and leaving the place for more
initialization code in a hope we could merge it with
report__setup_sample_type one day.
