bpf, x86/sparc: show actual number of passes in bpf_jit_dump

When bpf_jit_compile() got split into two functions via commit
f3c2af7ba17a ("net: filter: x86: split bpf_jit_compile()"), bpf_jit_dump()
was changed to always show 0 as number of compiler passes. Change it to
dump the actual number. Also on sparc, we count passes starting from 0,
so add 1 for the debug dump as well.
