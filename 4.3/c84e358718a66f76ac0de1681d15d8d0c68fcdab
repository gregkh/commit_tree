soc: Mediatek: Add SCPSYS power domain driver

This adds a power domain driver for the Mediatek SCPSYS unit.

The System Control Processor System (SCPSYS) has several power
management related tasks in the system. The tasks include thermal
measurement, dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS), interrupt
filter and lowlevel sleep control. The System Power Manager (SPM)
inside the SCPSYS is for the MTCMOS power domain control.

For now this driver only adds power domain support, the more
advanced features are not yet supported. The driver implements
the generic PM domain device tree bindings, the first user will
most likely be the Mediatek AFE audio driver.
