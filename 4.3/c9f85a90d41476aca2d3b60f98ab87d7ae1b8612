power: bq24190_charger: Fix charge type sysfs property

Access to the BQ24190's configurable charge type property (none, trickle,
fast) is being masked by an incorrect power_supply_property entry. After
applying this patch a new 'charge_type' property will appear in the
bq24190-charger sysfs folder backed up by getters/setters already
present in the driver.
