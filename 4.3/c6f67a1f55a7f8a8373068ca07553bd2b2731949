iio: allow userspace to flush the hwfifo with non-blocking reads

This patch changes the semantics of non-blocking reads so that a
hardware fifo flush is triggered if the available data in the device
buffer is less then the requested size.

This allows userspace to accurately generate hardware fifo flushes, by
doing a non-blocking read with a size greater then the sum of the
device buffer and hardware fifo size.
