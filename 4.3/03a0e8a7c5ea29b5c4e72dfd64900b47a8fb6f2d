mtd: nand: sunxi: fix OOB handling in ->write_xxx() functions

The USER_DATA register cannot be accessed using byte accessors on A13
SoCs, thus triggering a bug when using memcpy_toio on this register.
Declare an helper macros to convert an OOB buffer into a suitable
USER_DATA value and vice-versa.

This patch also fixes an error in the oob_required logic (some OOB data
are not written even if the user required it) by removing the
oob_required condition, which is perfectly valid since the core already
fill ->oob_poi with FFs when oob_required is false.
