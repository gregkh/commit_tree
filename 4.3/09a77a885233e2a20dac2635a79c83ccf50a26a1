modsign: Fix GPL/OpenSSL licence incompatibility

The GPL does not permit us to link against the OpenSSL library. Use
LGPL for sign-file and extract-file instead.

[ The whole "openssl isn't compatible with gpl" is really just
  fear-mongering, but there's no reason not to make modsign LGPL, so
  nobody cares.  - Linus ]
