blkcg: use blkg_free() in blkcg_init_queue() failure path

When blkcg_init_queue() fails midway after creating a new blkg, it
performs kfree() directly; however, this doesn't free the policy data
areas.  Make it use blkg_free() instead.  In turn, blkg_free() is
updated to handle root request_list special case.

While this fixes a possible memory leak, it's on an unlikely failure
path of an already cold path and the size leaked per occurrence is
miniscule too.  I don't think it needs to be tagged for -stable.
