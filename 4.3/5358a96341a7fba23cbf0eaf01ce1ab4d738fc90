KVM: PPC: Fix warnings from sparse

When compiling the KVM code for POWER with "make C=1", sparse
complains about functions missing proper prototypes and a 64-bit
constant missing the ULL prefix. Let's fix this by making the
functions static or by including the proper header with the
prototypes, and by appending a ULL prefix to the constant
PPC_MPPE_ADDRESS_MASK.
