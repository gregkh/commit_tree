mei: bus: fix drivers and devices names confusion

In the mei bus layer there is use of different variables
of driver and device types with no clear naming convention.
There are generic struct device and struct driver,
then mei_cl_{device, driver}, and finally mei_device which
in this context serves as a bus device.

The patch sets following naming convention:

the variables of type struct device remains dev
the variables of type struct driver remains drv
the variables of type struct mei_cl_device are now cldev
the variables of type struct mei_cl_driver are now cldrv
the variables of type struct mei_device are now bus, in bus
layer context
