xen: limit memory to architectural maximum

When a pv-domain (including dom0) is started it tries to size it's
p2m list according to the maximum possible memory amount it ever can
achieve. Limit the initial maximum memory size to the architectural
limit of the hardware in order to avoid overflows during remapping
of memory.

This problem will occur when dom0 is started with an initial memory
size being a multiple of 1GB, but without specifying it's maximum
memory size. The kernel must be configured without
CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG for the problem to happen.
