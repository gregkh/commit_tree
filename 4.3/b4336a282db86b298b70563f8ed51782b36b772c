mwifiex: sdio: reset adapter using mmc_hw_reset

Since 1fb654fd97ff("mmc: sdio: add reset callback to bus operations"),
sdio cards can be power cycled using mmc_hw_reset.
The use mmc_remove_host/mmc_add_host is discouraged, because these are
internal functions to the mmc core and should only be used by mmc hosts
