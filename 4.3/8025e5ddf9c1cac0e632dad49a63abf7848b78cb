[media] mm: Provide new get_vaddr_frames() helper

Provide new function get_vaddr_frames().  This function maps virtual
addresses from given start and fills given array with page frame numbers of
the corresponding pages. If given start belongs to a normal vma, the function
grabs reference to each of the pages to pin them in memory. If start
belongs to VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP vma, we don't touch page structures. Caller
must make sure pfns aren't reused for anything else while he is using
them.

This function is created for various drivers to simplify handling of
their buffers.
