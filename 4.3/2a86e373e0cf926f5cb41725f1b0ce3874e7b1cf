[media] DocBook: add dvb_ringbuffer.h to documentation

There are already some comments at dvb_ringbuffer.h that are ready
for DocBook, although not properly formatted.

Convert them, fix some issues and add this file to
the device-drivers DocBook.

While here, put multi-line comments on the right format.
