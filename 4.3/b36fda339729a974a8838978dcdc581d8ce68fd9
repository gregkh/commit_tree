Drivers: hv: kvp: check kzalloc return value

kzalloc() return value check was accidentally lost in 11bc3a5fa91f:
"Drivers: hv: kvp: convert to hv_utils_transport" commit.

We don't need to reset kvp_transaction.state here as we have the
kvp_timeout_func() timeout function and in case we're in OOM situation
it is preferable to wait.
