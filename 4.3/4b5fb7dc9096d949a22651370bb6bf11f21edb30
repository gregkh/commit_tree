clk: pxa: fix core frequency reporting unit

Legacy drivers which are not yet ported, such as cpufreq-pxa[23]xx, rely
on pxaXXx_get_clk_frequency_khz() to find the CPU core frequency.

This reporting was broken because the expected unit is kHz and not
Hz. Fix the reporting for pxa25x, pxa27x and pxa3xx.
