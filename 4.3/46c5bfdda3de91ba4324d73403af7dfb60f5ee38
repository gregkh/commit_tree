clockevents/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate arm_arch_timer driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided
by the clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked
obsolete now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.
