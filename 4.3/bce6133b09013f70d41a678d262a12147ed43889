cfq-iosched: fix oom cfq_queue ref leak in cfq_set_request()

If the cfq_queue cached in cfq_io_cq is the oom one, cfq_set_request()
replaces it by invoking cfq_get_queue() again without putting the oom
queue leaking the reference it was holding.  While oom queues are not
released through reference counting, they're still reference counted
and this can theoretically lead to the reference count overflowing and
incorrectly invoke the usual release path on it.

Fix it by making cfq_set_request() put the ref it was holding.
