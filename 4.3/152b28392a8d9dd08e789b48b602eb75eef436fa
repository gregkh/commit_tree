KVM: s390: Fix assumption that kvm_set_irq_routing is always run successfully

This fixes the assumption that kvm_set_irq_routing is always run
successfully by instead making it equal to the variable r which
we use for returning in the function kvm_arch_vm_ioctl instead
of making r equal to zero when calling this particular function
and incorrectly making the caller of kvm_arch_vm_ioctl think
the function has run successfully.
