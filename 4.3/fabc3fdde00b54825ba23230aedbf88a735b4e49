memcg: get rid of mem_cgroup_root_css for !CONFIG_MEMCG

The only user is cgwb_bdi_init and that one depends on
CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK which in turn depends on CONFIG_MEMCG so it
doesn't make much sense to definte an empty stub for !CONFIG_MEMCG.
Moreover ERR_PTR(-EINVAL) is ugly and would lead to runtime crashes if
used in unguarded code paths.  Better fail during compilation.
