f2fs: restrict multimedia filename

When testing with fs_mark, some blocks were written out as cold
data which were mixed with warm data, resulting in splitting more
bios.

This is because fs_mark will create file with random filename as
below:

559551ee~~~~~~~~15Z29OCC05JCKQP60JQ42MKV
559551ee~~~~~~~~NZAZ6X8OA8LHIIP6XD0L58RM
559551ef~~~~~~~~B15YDSWAK789HPSDZKYTW6WM
559551f1~~~~~~~~2DAE5DPS79785BUNTFWBEMP3
559551f1~~~~~~~~1MYDY0BKSQCJPI32Q8C514RM
559551f1~~~~~~~~YQOTMAOMN5CVRFOUNI026MP4
559551f3~~~~~~~~1WF42LPRTQJNPPGR3EINKMPE

They are regarded as cold file since their filename are ended with
multimedia files' extension, but this should be wrong as we only
match the extension of filename, not the whole one.

In this patch, we try to fix the format of multimedia filename to:
"filename + '.' + extension", then we set cold file only its
filename matches the format.

So after this change, it will reduce the probability we set the
wrong cold file, also it helps a little for fs_mark's performance
on f2fs.
