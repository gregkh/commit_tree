arm64: atomics: patch in lse instructions when supported by the CPU

On CPUs which support the LSE atomic instructions introduced in ARMv8.1,
it makes sense to use them in preference to ll/sc sequences.

This patch introduces runtime patching of atomic_t and atomic64_t
routines so that the call-site for the out-of-line ll/sc sequences is
patched with an LSE atomic instruction when we detect that
the CPU supports it.

If binutils is not recent enough to assemble the LSE instructions, then
the ll/sc sequences are inlined as though CONFIG_ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS=n.
