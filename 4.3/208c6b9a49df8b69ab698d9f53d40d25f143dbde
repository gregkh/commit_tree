net: netcp: Fixes error in oversized memory allocation for statistics storage

The CPSW driver keeps internally some, but not all, of
the statistics available in the hw statistics modules.  Furthermore,
some of the locations in the hw statistics modules are reserved and
contain no useful information.  Prior to this patch, the driver
allocates memory of the size of the the whole hw statistics modules,
instead of the size of statistics-entries-interested-in (i.e. et_stats),
for internal storage.  This patch fixes that.
