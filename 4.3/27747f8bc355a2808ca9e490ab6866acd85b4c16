perf/x86/hw_breakpoints: Fix check for kernel-space breakpoints

The check looked wrong, although I think it was actually safe.  TASK_SIZE
is unnecessarily small for compat tasks, and it wasn't possible to make
a range breakpoint so large it started in user space and ended in kernel
space.

Nonetheless, let's fix up the check for the benefit of future
readers.  A breakpoint is in the kernel if either end is in the
kernel.
