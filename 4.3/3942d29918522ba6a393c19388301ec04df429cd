mm/slab_common: allow NULL cache pointer in kmem_cache_destroy()

kmem_cache_destroy() does not tolerate a NULL kmem_cache pointer argument
and performs a NULL-pointer dereference.  This requires additional
attention and effort from developers/reviewers and forces all
kmem_cache_destroy() callers (200+ as of 4.1) to do a NULL check

    if (cache)
        kmem_cache_destroy(cache);

Or, otherwise, be invalid kmem_cache_destroy() users.

Tweak kmem_cache_destroy() and NULL-check the pointer there.

Proposed by Andrew Morton.
