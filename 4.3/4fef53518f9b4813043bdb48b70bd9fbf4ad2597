drivers/tty: make serial/sunhv.c driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this driver is currently:

config SERIAL_SUNHV
        bool "Sun4v Hypervisor Console support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by
anyone.  Lets remove the modular and unused code here, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We don't swap module.h for init.h since this file has init.h already.

We leave some tags like MODULE_LICENSE for documentation purposes, and
for the "git blame" value.  Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a
no-op for non-modular code, so we remove that too.
