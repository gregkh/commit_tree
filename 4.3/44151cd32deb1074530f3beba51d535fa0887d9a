i40evf: add MAC address filter in open, not init

During close, all of the MAC filters are cleared, so the driver would be
unable to receive unicast packets after being closed and reopened.

Add the adapter's "hardware" MAC address filter in open, not init. This
ensures that the correct filter is present each time.
