iwlwifi: mvm: don't disconnect on beacon loss in D0I3

Currently if we wake up during D0I3 due to beacon loss we disconnect
immediately. This behaviour causes redundant disconnection, which could
be prevented by polling as it is usually done in mac80211.
Instead, we prefer reporting beacon loss and let mac80211 try polling
before disconnection.
