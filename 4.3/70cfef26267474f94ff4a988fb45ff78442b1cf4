regulator: Add lockdep asserts to help detecting locking misuse

Add lockdep_assert_held_once() to functions explicitly mentioning that
rdev or regulator_list mutex must be held. Using WARN_ONCE shouldn't
pollute the dmesg to much.

The patch (if CONFIG_LOCKDEP enabled) will show warnings in certain
regulators calling regulator_notifier_call_chain() without rdev->mutex
held.
