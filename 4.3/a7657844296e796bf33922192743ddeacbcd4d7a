powerpc: Rework syscall_get_arguments() so there is only one loop

Currently syscall_get_arguments() has two loops, one for compat and one
for regular tasks. In prepartion for the next patch, which changes which
registers we use, switch it to only have one loop, so we only have one
place to update.
