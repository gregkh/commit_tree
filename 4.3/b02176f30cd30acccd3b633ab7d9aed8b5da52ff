block: don't release bdi while request_queue has live references

bdi's are initialized in two steps, bdi_init() and bdi_register(), but
destroyed in a single step by bdi_destroy() which, for a bdi embedded
in a request_queue, is called during blk_cleanup_queue() which makes
the queue invisible and starts the draining of remaining usages.

A request_queue's user can access the congestion state of the embedded
bdi as long as it holds a reference to the queue.  As such, it may
access the congested state of a queue which finished
blk_cleanup_queue() but hasn't reached blk_release_queue() yet.
Because the congested state was embedded in backing_dev_info which in
turn is embedded in request_queue, accessing the congested state after
bdi_destroy() was called was fine.  The bdi was destroyed but the
memory region for the congested state remained accessible till the
queue got released.

a13f35e87140 ("writeback: don't embed root bdi_writeback_congested in
bdi_writeback") changed the situation.  Now, the root congested state
which is expected to be pinned while request_queue remains accessible
is separately reference counted and the base ref is put during
bdi_destroy().  This means that the root congested state may go away
prematurely while the queue is between bdi_dstroy() and
blk_cleanup_queue(), which was detected by Andrey's KASAN tests.

The root cause of this problem is that bdi doesn't distinguish the two
steps of destruction, unregistration and release, and now the root
congested state actually requires a separate release step.  To fix the
issue, this patch separates out bdi_unregister() and bdi_exit() from
bdi_destroy().  bdi_unregister() is called from blk_cleanup_queue()
and bdi_exit() from blk_release_queue().  bdi_destroy() is now just a
simple wrapper calling the two steps back-to-back.

While at it, the prototype of bdi_destroy() is moved right below
bdi_setup_and_register() so that the counterpart operations are
located together.
