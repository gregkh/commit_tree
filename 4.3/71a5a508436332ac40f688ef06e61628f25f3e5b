power_supply: bq24735: Convert to using managed resources

Use managed resource functions like devm_kasprintf and
devm_power_supply_register in bq24735_charger_probe. To be
compatible with the change, replace various gotos by direct
returns and drop unneeded labels.

Also, remove bq24735_charger_remove as it is now redundant.
