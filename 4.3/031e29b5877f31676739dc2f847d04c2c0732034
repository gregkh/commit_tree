drivers/video/concole: add negative dependency for VGA_CONSOLE on ARC

Architectures which support VGA console must define screen_info
structurture from "uapi/linux/screen_info.h".  Otherwise undefined
symbol error occurs.  Usually it's defined in "setup.c" for each
architecture.

If an architecture does not support VGA console (ARC's case) there are 2
ways: define a dummy instance of screen_info or add a negative
dependency for VGA_CONSOLE in to prevent selecting this option.

I've implemented the second way.  However the best solution is to add
HAVE_VGA_CONSOLE option for targets which support VGA console.  Then
turn off VGA_CONSOLE by default and add dependency to HAVE_VGA_CONSOLE.
But right now it's better to just add a negative dependency for ARC and
then consider how to collaborate about this issue with maintainers of
other architectures.
