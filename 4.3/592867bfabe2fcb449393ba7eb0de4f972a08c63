ebpf: fix fd refcount leaks related to maps in bpf syscall

We may already have gotten a proper fd struct through fdget(), so
whenever we return at the end of an map operation, we need to call
fdput(). However, each map operation from syscall side first probes
CHECK_ATTR() to verify that unused fields in the bpf_attr union are
zero.

In case of malformed input, we return with error, but the lookup to
the map_fd was already performed at that time, so that we return
without an corresponding fdput(). Fix it by performing an fdget()
only right before bpf_map_get(). The fdget() invocation on maps in
the verifier is not affected.
