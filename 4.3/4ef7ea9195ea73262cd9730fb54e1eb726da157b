VSOCK: sock_put wasn't safe to call in interrupt context

In the vsock vmci_transport driver, sock_put wasn't safe to call
in interrupt context, since that may call the vsock destructor
which in turn calls several functions that should only be called
from process context. This change defers the callling of these
functions  to a worker thread. All these functions were
deallocation of resources related to the transport itself.

Furthermore, an unused callback was removed to simplify the
cleanup.

Multiple customers have been hitting this issue when using
VMware tools on vSphere 2015.

Also added a version to the vmci transport module (starting from
1.0.2.0-k since up until now it appears that this module was
sharing version with vsock that is currently at 1.0.1.0-k).
