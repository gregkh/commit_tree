IB/hfi1: fix copy_to/from_user() error handling

copy_to/from_user() returns the number of bytes which we were not able
to copy.  It doesn't return an error code.

Also a couple places had a printk() on error and I removed that because
people can take advantage of it to fill /var/log/messages with spam.
