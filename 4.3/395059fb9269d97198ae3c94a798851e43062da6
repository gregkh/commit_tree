net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: rename ATU MAC accessors

Rename the __mv88e6xxx_{read,write}_addr functions to more explicit
_mv88e6xxx_atu_mac_{read,write} functions, which also respect the single
underscore convention used in the file (meaning SMI lock must be held).

In the meantime, define their MAC address parameters as an array of
ETH_ALEN bytes instead of a char pointer.
