serial: 8250: bind to ALi Fast Infrared Controller (ALI5123)

This way this device can be used with irtty-sir -
at least on Toshiba Satellite A20-S103 it is not configured by default
and needs PNP activation before it starts to respond on I/O ports.

This device has actually its own driver (ali-ircc),
but this driver seems to be non-functional for a very long time
