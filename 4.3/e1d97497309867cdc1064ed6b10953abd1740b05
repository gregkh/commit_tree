MIPS: Remove "weak" from mips_cdmm_phys_base() declaration

Weak header file declarations are error-prone because they make every
definition weak, and the linker chooses one based on link order (see
10629d711ed7 ("PCI: Remove __weak annotation from pcibios_get_phb_of_node
decl")).

mips_cdmm_phys_base() is defined only in arch/mips/mti-malta/malta-memory.c
so there's no problem with multiple definitions.  But it works better to
have a weak default implementation and allow a strong function to override
it.  Then we don't have to test whether a definition is present, and if
there are ever multiple strong definitions, we get a link error instead of
calling a random definition.

Add a weak mips_cdmm_phys_base() definition and remove the weak annotation
from the declaration in arch/mips/include/asm/cdmm.h.
