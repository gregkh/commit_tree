cgroup: fix seq_show_option merge with legacy_name

When seq_show_option (commit a068acf2ee77: "fs: create and use
seq_show_option for escaping") was merged, it did not correctly collide
with cgroup's addition of legacy_name (commit 3e1d2eed39d8: "cgroup:
introduce cgroup_subsys->legacy_name") changes.

This fixes the reported name.
