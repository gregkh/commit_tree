xfs: lockdep annotations throw warnings on non-debug builds

SO, now if we enable lockdep without enabling CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG,
the lockdep annotations throw a warning because the assert that uses
the lockdep define is not built in:

fs/xfs/xfs_inode.c:367:1: warning: 'xfs_lockdep_subclass_ok' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
    xfs_lockdep_subclass_ok(

So now we need to create an ifdef mess to sort this all out, because
we need to handle all the combinations of CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG=[y|n],
CONFIG_XFS_WARNING=[y|n] and CONFIG_LOCKDEP=[y|n] appropriately.
