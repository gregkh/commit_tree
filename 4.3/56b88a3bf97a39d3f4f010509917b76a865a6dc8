um: Fix kernel mode fault condition

We have to exclude memory locations <= PAGE_SIZE from
the condition and let the kernel mode fault path catch it.
Otherwise a kernel NULL pointer exception will be reported
as a kernel user space access.

Fixes: d2313084e2c (um: Catch unprotected user memory access)
