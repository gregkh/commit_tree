hexdump: do not print debug dumps for !CONFIG_DEBUG

print_hex_dump_debug() is likely supposed to be analogous to pr_debug() or
dev_dbg() & friends.  Currently it will adhere to dynamic debug, but will
not stub out prints if CONFIG_DEBUG is not set.  Let's make it do the
right thing, because I am tired of having my dmesg buffer full of hex
dumps on production systems.
