hfs: fix B-tree corruption after insertion at position 0

Fix B-tree corruption when a new record is inserted at position 0 in the
node in hfs_brec_insert().

This is an identical change to the corresponding hfs b-tree code to Sergei
Antonov's "hfsplus: fix B-tree corruption after insertion at position 0",
to keep similar code paths in the hfs and hfsplus drivers in sync, where
appropriate.
