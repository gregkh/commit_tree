ARM: dts: Fix LEDs on exynos5422-odroidxu3

The LEDs on Odroid XU3 family boards could not properly probe
because PWM outputs were reduced only to PWM for fan. Fix it
for Odroid XU3 and XU3-Lite boards by switching to usage of
all 4 outputs (although the PWM for MIPI probably is redundant
because board does not have MIPI connector available).

This fixes warnings on dmesg:
[    4.838712] samsung-pwm 12dd0000.pwm: tried to request PWM channel 1 without output
[    4.838725] leds_pwm pwmleds: unable to request PWM for green:mmc0: -22
[    4.838767] leds_pwm: probe of pwmleds failed with error -22
