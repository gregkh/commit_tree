irqchip/GIC: Add workaround for aliased GIC400

The GICv2 architecture mandates that the two 4kB GIC regions are
contiguous, and on two separate physical pages (so that access to
the second page can be trapped by a hypervisor). This doesn't work
very well when PAGE_SIZE is 64kB.

A relatively common hack^Wway to work around this is to alias each
4kB region over its own 64kB page. Of course in this case, the base
address you want to use is not really the begining of the region,
but base + 60kB (so that you get a contiguous 8kB region over two
distinct pages).

Normally, this would be described in DT with a new property, but
some HW is already out there, and the firmware makes sure that
it will override whatever you put in the GIC node. Duh. And of course,
said firmware source code is not available, despite being based
on u-boot.

The workaround is to detect the case where the CPU interface size
is set to 128kB, and verify the aliasing by checking that the ID
register for GIC400 (which is the only GIC wired this way so far)
is the same at base and base + 0xF000. In this case, we update
the GIC base address and let it roll.

And if you feel slightly sick by looking at this, rest assured that
I do too...
