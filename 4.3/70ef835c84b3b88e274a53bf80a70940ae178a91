mei: support for dynamic clients

HBM version 2.0 and above allows ME clients in the system to
register/unregister after the system is fully initialized.
Clients may be added or removed after enum_resp message was
received

1. To preserve backward compatibility the driver can opt-in to receive
client add messages by setting allow_add field in enum_req

2. A new client is added upon reception of MEI_HBM_ADD_CLIENT_REQ_CMD

3. A client is removed in a lazy manner when connection request
respond with MEI_HBMS_CLIENT_NOT_FOUND status
