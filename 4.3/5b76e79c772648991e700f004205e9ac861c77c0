gpiolib: irqchip: prevent driver unloading if gpio is used as irq only

Now nothing prevents GPIO driver from being unloaded if its gpios
were requested as GPIO IRQs only (without calling gpio_request()).

Hence, add calls of try_module_get()/module_put() into
gpiochip_irq_reqres/relres() to track such scenario properly.
