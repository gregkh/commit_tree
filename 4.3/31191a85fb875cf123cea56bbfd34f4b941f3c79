perf report: Add support for srcfile sort key

In some cases it's useful to characterize samples by file. This is
useful to get a higher level categorization, for example to map cost to
subsystems.

Add a srcfile sort key to perf report. It builds on top of the existing
srcline support.

Commiter notes:

E.g.:

  # perf record -F 10000 usleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.016 MB perf.data (13 samples) ]
  [root@zoo ~]# perf report -s srcfile --stdio
  # Total Lost Samples: 0
  #
  # Samples: 13  of event 'cycles'
  # Event count (approx.): 869878
  #
  # Overhead  Source File
  # ........  ...........
      60.99%  .
      20.62%  paravirt.h
      14.23%  rmap.c
       4.04%  signal.c
       0.11%  msr.h

  #

The first line is collecting all the files for which srcfiles couldn't somehow
get resolved to:

  # perf report -s srcfile,dso --stdio
  # Total Lost Samples: 0
  #
  # Samples: 13  of event 'cycles'
  # Event count (approx.): 869878
  #
  # Overhead  Source File  Shared Object
  # ........  ...........  ................
      40.97%  .            ld-2.20.so
      20.62%  paravirt.h   [kernel.vmlinux]
      20.02%  .            libc-2.20.so
      14.23%  rmap.c       [kernel.vmlinux]
       4.04%  signal.c     [kernel.vmlinux]
       0.11%  msr.h        [kernel.vmlinux]

XXX: Investigate why that is not resolving on Fedora 21, Andi says he hasn't
     seen this on Fedora 22.
