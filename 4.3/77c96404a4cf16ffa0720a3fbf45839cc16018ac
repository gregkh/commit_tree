mac80211: remove key TX/RX counter

This counter is inherently racy (since it can be incremented by RX
as well as by concurrent TX) and only available in debugfs. Instead
of fixing it to be per-CPU or similar, remove it for now. If needed
it should be added without races and with proper nl80211, perhaps
even addressing the threshold reporting TODO item that's been there
since the code was originally added.
