tty/early: make serial8250_early_{in,out} static again

Commit ed71871bed719 ("tty/8250_early: Turn serial_in/serial_out into
weak symbols") made these routines weak to allow platform specific
Big endian override

However recent updates to core, specifically ebc5e20082 ("serial:
of_serial: Support big-endian register accesses") and 6e63be3fee14
("serial: earlycon: Add support for big-endian MMIO accesses") means
that round about way to overide the early serial accessors is no longer
needed.
