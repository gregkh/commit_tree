drm/i915: Report to userspace if we have a (presumed) working GPU reset

In igt, we want to test handling of GPU hangs, both for recovery
purposes and for reporting. However, we don't want to inject a genuine
GPU hang onto a machine that cannot recover and so be permenantly
wedged. Rather than embed heuristics into igt, have the kernel report
exactly when it expects the GPU reset to work.

This can also be usefully extended in future to indicate different
levels of fine-grained resets.
