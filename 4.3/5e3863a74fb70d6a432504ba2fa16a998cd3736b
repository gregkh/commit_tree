cpufreq: exynos: Remove unselectable rule for arm-exynos-cpufreq.o

Commit 966f2a71a92d ("cpufreq: exynos: remove Exynos4x12 specific
cpufreq driver support") deleted option ARM_EXYNOS_CPUFREQ but missed
to delete a rule in drivers/cpufreq/Makefile which depends on that
option.

Remove unselectable rule for arm-exynos-cpufreq.o
from drivers/cpufreq/Makefile.
