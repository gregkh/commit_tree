openvswitch: Reject ct_state masks for unknown bits

Currently, 0-bits are generated in ct_state where the bit position is
undefined, and matches are accepted on these bit-positions. If userspace
requests to match the 0-value for this bit then it may expect only a
subset of traffic to match this value, whereas currently all packets
will have this bit set to 0. Fix this by rejecting such masks.
