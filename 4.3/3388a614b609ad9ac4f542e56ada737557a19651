PCI: Add quirk for Intel DH895xCC VF PCI config erratum

The PCI capabilities list for Intel DH895xCC VFs (device id 0x0443) with
QuickAssist Technology is prematurely terminated in hardware.
Workaround the issue by hard-coding the known expected next capability
pointer and saving the PCIE cap into internal buffer.
