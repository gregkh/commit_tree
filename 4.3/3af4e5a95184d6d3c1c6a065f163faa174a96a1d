HID: usbhid: Fix the check for HID_RESET_PENDING in hid_io_error

It was reported that after 10-20 reboots, a usb keyboard plugged
into a docking station would not work unless it was replugged in.

Using usbmon, it turns out the interrupt URBs were streaming with
callback errors of -71 for some reason.  The hid-core.c::hid_io_error was
supposed to retry and then reset, but the reset wasn't really happening.

The check for HID_NO_BANDWIDTH was inverted.  Fix was simple.

Tested by reporter and locally by me by unplugging a keyboard halfway until I
could recreate a stream of errors but no disconnect.
