Revert "serial: 8250_dma: don't bother DMA with small transfers"

This reverts commit 9119fba0cfeda6d415c9f068df66838a104b87cb.

This commit prevents from sending "big" file using Bluetooth.
When sending a lot of data quickly through the Bluetooth interface, and
after a variable amount of data sent, transfer fails with error:
    kernel: [  415.247453] Bluetooth: hci0 hardware error 0x00

Found on T100TA.

After reverting this commit, send works fine for any file size.
