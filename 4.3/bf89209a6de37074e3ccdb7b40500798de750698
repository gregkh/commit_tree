drm/mga200g: Hold a proper reference for cursor_set

Looking up an obj, immediate dropping the acquired reference and then
continuing to use it isn't how this is supposed to work. Fix this by
holding a reference for the entire function.

While at it stop grabbing dev->struct_mutex, it doesn't protect
anything here.
