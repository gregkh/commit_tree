usb: ehci-platform: Fix using multiple controllers from OF

When using OF defined controllers the platform data struct is shared
between all devices, so it can't be used for device specific settings.
However it is currently used for the OF properties
needs-reset-on-resume and has-transaction-translator.

To fix this issue move setting hcd->has_tt to the probe and
move pdata->reset_on_resume to the private data.
