blkcg: remove unnecessary blkcg_root handling from css_alloc/free paths

blkcg_css_alloc() bypasses policy data allocation and blkcg_css_free()
bypasses policy data and blkcg freeing for blkcg_root.  There's no
reason to to treat policy data any differently for blkcg_root.  If the
root css gets allocated after policies are registered, policy
registration path will add policy data; otherwise, the alloc path
will.  The free path isn't never invoked for root csses.

This patch removes the unnecessary special handling of blkcg_root from
css_alloc/free paths.
