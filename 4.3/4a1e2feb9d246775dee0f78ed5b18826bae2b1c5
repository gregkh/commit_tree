NFSv4.1: Fix a protocol issue with CLOSE stateids

According to RFC5661 Section 18.2.4, CLOSE is supposed to return
the zero stateid. This means that nfs_clear_open_stateid_locked()
cannot assume that the result stateid will always match the 'other'
field of the existing open stateid when trying to determine a race
with a parallel OPEN.

Instead, we look at the argument, and check for matches.
