staging: comedi: me4000: remove unnecessary ME4000_AI_LIST_INPUT_SINGLE_ENDED

This define evaluates to 0 and is OR'ed with the 'entry' value that is
written to the ME4000_AI_CHANNEL_LIST_REG when the channel aref is a
single-ended type (AREF_GROUND or AREF_COMMON). OR'ing a zero value is
pretty silly, just remove it.

Remove the switch() in me4000_ai_insn_read() to simplify the code.
