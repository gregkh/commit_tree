zsmalloc: account the number of compacted pages

Compaction returns back to zram the number of migrated objects, which is
quite uninformative -- we have objects of different sizes so user space
cannot obtain any valuable data from that number.  Change compaction to
operate in terms of pages and return back to compaction issuer the
number of pages that were freed during compaction.  So from now on we
will export more meaningful value in zram<id>/mm_stat -- the number of
freed (compacted) pages.

This requires:
 (a) a rename of `num_migrated' to 'pages_compacted'
 (b) a internal API change -- return first_page's fullness_group from
     putback_zspage(), so we know when putback_zspage() did
     free_zspage().  It helps us to account compaction stats correctly.
