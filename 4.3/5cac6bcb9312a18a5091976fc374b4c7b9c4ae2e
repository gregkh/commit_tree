md/raid5: always set conf->prev_chunk_sectors and ->prev_algo

These aren't really needed when no reshape is happening,
but it is safer to have them always set to a meaningful value.
The next patch will use ->prev_chunk_sectors without checking
if a reshape is happening (because that makes the code simpler),
and this patch makes that safe.
