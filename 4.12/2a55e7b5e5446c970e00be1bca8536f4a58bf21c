staging: android: ion: Call dma_map_sg for syncing and mapping

Technically, calling dma_buf_map_attachment should return a buffer
properly dma_mapped. Add calls to dma_map_sg to begin_cpu_access to
ensure this happens. As a side effect, this lets Ion buffers take
advantage of the dma_buf sync ioctls.
