Revert "ata: sata_mv: Convert to devm_ioremap_resource()"

This reverts commit 368e5fbdfc60732643f34f538823ed4bc8829827.

devm_ioremap_resource() enforces that there are no overlapping
resources, where as devm_ioremap() does not. The sata phy driver needs
a subset of the sata IO address space, so maps some of the sata
address space. As a result, sata_mv now fails to probe, reporting it
cannot get its resources, and so we don't have any SATA disks.
