IB/IPoIB: ibX: failed to create mcg debug file

When udev renames the netdev devices, ipoib debugfs entries does not
get renamed. As a result, if subsequent probe of ipoib device reuse the
name then creating a debugfs entry for the new device would fail.

Also, moved ipoib_create_debug_files and ipoib_delete_debug_files as part
of ipoib event handling in order to avoid any race condition between these.

Fixes: 1732b0ef3b3a ([IPoIB] add path record information in debugfs)
