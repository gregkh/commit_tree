tools/kvm_stat: add interactive command 'r'

Provide an interactive command to reset the tracepoint statistics.
Requires some extra work for debugfs, as the counters cannot be reset.

On the up side, this offers us the opportunity to have debugfs values
reset on startup and whenever a filter is modified, becoming consistent
with the tracepoint provider. As a bonus, 'kvmstat -dt' will now provide
useful output, instead of mixing values in totally different orders of
magnitude.
Furthermore, we avoid unnecessary resets when any of the filters is
"changed" interactively to the previous value.
