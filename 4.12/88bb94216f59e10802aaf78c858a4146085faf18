pinctrl: rockchip: avoid hardirq-unsafe functions in irq_chip

With real-time preemption, regmap functions cannot be used in the
implementation of irq_chip since they use spinlocks which may sleep.

Move the setting of the mux for IRQs to an irq_bus_sync_unlock handler
where we are allowed to sleep.
