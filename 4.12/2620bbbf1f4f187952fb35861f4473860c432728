x86/platform/uv/BAU: Add wait_completion to bau_operations

Remove the present wait_completion routine and add a function pointer by
the same name to the bau_operations struct. Rather than switching on the
UV hub version during message processing, set the architecture-specific
uv*_wait_completion during initialization.

The uv123_bau_ops struct must be split into uv1 and uv2_3 versions to
accommodate the corresponding wait_completion routines.
