md5: remove from lib and only live in crypto

The md5_transform function is no longer used any where in the tree,
except for the crypto api's actual implementation of md5, so we can drop
the function from lib and put it as a static function of the crypto
file, where it belongs. There should be no new users of md5_transform,
anyway, since there are more modern ways of doing what it once achieved.
