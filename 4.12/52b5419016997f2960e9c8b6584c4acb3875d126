KVM: x86: Fix virtual wire mode

Intel SDM says, that at most one LAPIC should be configured with ExtINT
delivery. KVM configures all LAPICs this way. This causes pic_unlock()
to kick the first available vCPU from the internal KVM data structures.
If this vCPU is not the BSP, but some not-yet-booted AP, the BSP may
never realize that there is an interrupt.

Fix that by enabling ExtINT delivery only for the BSP.

This allows booting a Linux guest without a TSC in the above situation.
Otherwise the BSP gets stuck in calibrate_delay_converge().
