drm/msm: move submit fence wait out of struct_mutex

Probably a symptom of needing finer grained locking, but if we wait on
the incoming fence-fd (which could come from a different context) while
holding struct_mutex, that blocks retire_worker so gpu fences cannot get
signalled.

This causes a problem if userspace manages to get more than a frame
ahead, leaving the atomic-commit worker blocked waiting on fences that
cannot be signaled because submit is blocked waiting for a fence
signalled from vblank (after the atomic commit which is blocked).

If we start having multiple fence ctxs for the gpu, submit_fence_sync()
would probably need to move outside of struct_mutex as well.
