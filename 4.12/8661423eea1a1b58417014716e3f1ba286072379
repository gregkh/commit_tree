ACPI / utils: Add new acpi_dev_present helper

acpi_dev_found just iterates over all ACPI-ids and sees if one matches.
This means that it will return true for devices which are in the DSDT
but disabled (their _STA method returns 0).

For some drivers it is useful to be able to check if a certain HID
is not only present in the namespace, but also actually present as in
acpi_device_is_present() will return true for the device. For example
because if a certain device is present then the driver will want to use
an extcon or IIO ADC channel provided by that device.

This commit adds a new acpi_dev_present helper which drivers can use
to this end.

Like acpi_dev_found, acpi_dev_present take a HID as argument, but
it also has 2 extra optional arguments to only check for an ACPI
device with a specific UID and/or HRV value. This makes it more
generic and allows it to replace custom code doing similar checks
in several places.

Arguably acpi_dev_present is what acpi_dev_found should have been, but
there are too many users to just change acpi_dev_found without the risk
of breaking something.
