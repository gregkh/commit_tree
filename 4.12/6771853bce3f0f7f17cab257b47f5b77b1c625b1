doc: Update requirements based on recent changes

These changes include lighter-weight expedited grace periods, the fact
that expedited grace periods and rcu_barrier() no longer block CPU
hotplug, some HTML font fixups, noting that rcu_barrier() need not wait
for a grace period (even if callbacks are posted), the fact that SRCU
read-side critical sections can be used from offline CPUs, and the fact
that SRCU now maintains per-CPU callback lists.
