cpufreq: schedutil: Trace frequency only if it has changed

sugov_update_commit() calls trace_cpu_frequency() to record the
current CPU frequency if it has not changed in the fast switch case
to prevent utilities from getting confused (they may report that the
CPU is idle if the frequency has not been recorded for too long, for
example).

However, that may cause the tracepoint to be triggered quite often
for no real reason (if the frequency doesn't change, we will not
modify the last update time stamp and governor computations may
run again shortly when that happens), so don't do that (arguably, it
is done to work around a utilities bug anyway).

That allows code duplication in sugov_update_commit() to be reduced
somewhat too.
