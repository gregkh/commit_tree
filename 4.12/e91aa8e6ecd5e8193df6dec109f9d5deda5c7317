KVM: PPC: Enable IOMMU_API for KVM_BOOK3S_64 permanently

It does not make much sense to have KVM in book3s-64 and
not to have IOMMU bits for PCI pass through support as it costs little
and allows VFIO to function on book3s KVM.

Having IOMMU_API always enabled makes it unnecessary to have a lot of
"#ifdef IOMMU_API" in arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_64_vio*. With those
ifdef's we could have only user space emulated devices accelerated
(but not VFIO) which do not seem to be very useful.
