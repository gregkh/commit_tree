SMB2: Fix share type handling

In fs/cifs/smb2pdu.h, we have:
#define SMB2_SHARE_TYPE_DISK    0x01
#define SMB2_SHARE_TYPE_PIPE    0x02
#define SMB2_SHARE_TYPE_PRINT   0x03

Knowing that, with the current code, the SMB2_SHARE_TYPE_PRINT case can
never trigger and printer share would be interpreted as disk share.

So, test the ShareType value for equality instead.
