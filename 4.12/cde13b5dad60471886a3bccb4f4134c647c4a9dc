arm64: KVM: Do not use stack-protector to compile EL2 code

We like living dangerously. Nothing explicitely forbids stack-protector
to be used in the EL2 code, while distributions routinely compile their
kernel with it. We're just lucky that no code actually triggers the
instrumentation.

Let's not try our luck for much longer, and disable stack-protector
for code living at EL2.
