ALSA: firewire-lib: enable CIP_DBC_IS_END_EVENT for both directions of stream

Commit c8bdf49b9935("ALSA: fireworks/firewire-lib: Add a quirk for the
meaning of dbc") adds CIP_DBC_IS_END_EVENT flag just for tx packets.
However, MOTU FireWire series has this quirk for rx packets.

This commit allows both directions with the flag.
