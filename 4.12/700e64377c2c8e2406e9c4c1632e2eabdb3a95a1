powerpc/ftrace: Move stack setup and teardown code into ftrace_graph_caller()

Move the stack setup and teardown code into ftrace_graph_caller(). This way, we
don't incur the cost of setting it up unless function graph is enabled for this
function.

Also, remove the extraneous LR restore code after the function graph stub. LR
has previously been restored and neither livepatch_handler() nor
ftrace_graph_caller() return back here.
