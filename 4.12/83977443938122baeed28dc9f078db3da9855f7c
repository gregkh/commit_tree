gpio: omap: return error if requested debounce time is not possible

omap_gpio_debounce() does not validate that the requested debounce
is within a range it can handle. Instead it lets the register value
wrap silently, and always returns success.

This can lead to all sorts of unexpected behavior, such as gpio_keys
asking for a too-long debounce, but getting a very short debounce in
practice.

Fix this by returning -EINVAL if the requested value does not fit into
the register field. If there is no debounce clock available at all,
return -ENOTSUPP.
