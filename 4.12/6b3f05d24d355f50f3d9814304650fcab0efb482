fsnotify: Detach mark from object list when last reference is dropped

Instead of removing mark from object list from fsnotify_detach_mark(),
remove the mark when last reference to the mark is dropped. This will
allow fanotify to wait for userspace response to event without having to
hold onto fsnotify_mark_srcu.

To avoid pinning inodes by elevated refcount (and thus e.g. delaying
file deletion) while someone holds mark reference, we detach connector
from the object also from fsnotify_destroy_marks() and not only after
removing last mark from the list as it was now.
