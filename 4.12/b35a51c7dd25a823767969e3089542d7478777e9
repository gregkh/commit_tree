cfg80211: Make pre-CAC results valid only for ETSI domain

DFS requirement for ETSI domain (section 4.7.1.4 in
ETSI EN 301 893 V1.8.1) is the only one which explicitly
states that once DFS channel is marked as available afer
the CAC, this channel will remain in available state even
moving to a different operating channel. But the same is
not explicitly stated in FCC DFS requirement. Also, Pre-CAC
requriements are not explicitly mentioned in FCC requirement.
Current implementation in keeping DFS channel in available
state is same as described in ETSI domain.

For non-ETSI DFS domain, this patch gives a grace period of 2 seconds
since the completion of successful CAC before moving the channel's
DFS state to 'usable' from 'available' state. The same grace period
is checked against the channel's dfs_state_entered timestamp while
deciding if a DFS channel is available for operation. There is a new
radar event, NL80211_RADAR_PRE_CAC_EXPIRED, reported when DFS channel
is moved from available to usable state after the grace period. Also
make sure the DFS channel state is reset to usable once the beaconing
operation on that channel is brought down (like stop_ap, leave_ibss
and leave_mesh) in non-ETSI domain.
