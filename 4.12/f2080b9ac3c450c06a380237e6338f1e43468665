powerpc/perf: Add Power8 mem_access event to sysfs

Patch add "mem_access" event to sysfs. This as-is not a raw event
supported by Power8 pmu. Instead, it is formed based on
raw event encoding specificed in isa207-common.h.

Primary PMU event used here is PM_MRK_INST_CMPL.
This event tracks only the completed marked instructions.

Random sampling mode (MMCRA[SM]) with Random Instruction
Sampling (RIS) is enabled to mark type of instructions.

With Random sampling in RLS mode with PM_MRK_INST_CMPL event,
the LDST /DATA_SRC fields in SIER identifies the memory
hierarchy level (eg: L1, L2 etc) statisfied a data-cache
miss for a marked instruction.
