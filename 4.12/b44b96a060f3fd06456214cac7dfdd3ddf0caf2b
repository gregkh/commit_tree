uartlite: Adding a kernel parameter for the number of uartlites

The number of uartlites should be set by a kernel parameter instead of
using a #define. This allows the user to set the number of uartlites
using only kconfig and not modifying kernel source.

The uartlite is used by FPGAs that support a basically unlimited number
of uarts so limiting it at 16 dosn't make sense as users might need more
than that.
