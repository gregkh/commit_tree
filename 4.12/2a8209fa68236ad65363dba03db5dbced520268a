pinctrl: cherryview: Extend the Chromebook DMI quirk to Intel_Strago systems

It turns out there are quite many Chromebooks out there that have the
same keyboard issue than Acer Chromebook. All of them are based on
Intel_Strago reference and report their DMI_PRODUCT_FAMILY as
"Intel_Strago" (Samsung Chromebook 3 and Cyan Chromebooks are exceptions
for which we add separate entries).

Instead of adding each machine to the quirk table, we use
DMI_PRODUCT_FAMILY of "Intel_Strago" that hopefully covers most of the
machines out there currently.
