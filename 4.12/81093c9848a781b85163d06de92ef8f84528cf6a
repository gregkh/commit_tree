Input: xpad - support some quirky Xbox One pads

There are several quirky Xbox One pads that depend on initialization
packets that the Microsoft pads don't require. To deal with these,
I've added a mechanism for issuing device-specific initialization
packets using a VID/PID-based quirks list.

For the initial set of init quirks, I have added quirk handling from
Valve's Steam Link xpad driver[0] and the 360Controller project[1] for
macOS to enable some new pads to work properly.

This should enable full functionality on the following quirky pads:
0x0e6f:0x0165 - Titanfall 2 gamepad (previously fully non-functional)
0x0f0d:0x0067 - Hori Horipad (analog sticks previously non-functional)
0x24c6:0x541a - PowerA Xbox One pad (previously fully non-functional)
0x24c6:0x542a - PowerA Xbox One pad (previously fully non-functional)
0x24c6:0x543a - PowerA Xbox One pad (previously fully non-functional)
