drm/sun4i: Save newly created layer in layers array in sun4i_layers_init

sun4i_layers_init allocates an array to store pointers to newly created
layers returned by sun4i_layer_init_one(), but fails to actually store
them. But it actually returns the empty array to unsuspecting users.

Save the pointers in the array, so that they may be used later.
