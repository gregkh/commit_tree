pinctrl: aspeed: Allow disabling Port D and Port E loopback mode

Port D and port E GPIO loopback modes are commonly enabled via hardware
straps for use with front-panel buttons.  When the BMC is powered
off or fails to boot, the front-panel buttons are directly connected to
the host chipset via the loopback to allow direct power-on and reset
control. Once the BMC has booted, the loopback mode must be disabled for
the BMC to take over control of host power-on and reset.

Disabling these loopback modes requires writing to the hardware strap
register which violates the current design of assuming the system
designer chose the strap settings for a specific reason and they should
be treated as read-only. Only the two bits of the strap register related
to these loopback modes are allowed to be written and comments have been
added to explain why.
