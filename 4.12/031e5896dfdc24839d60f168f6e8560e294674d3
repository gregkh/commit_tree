drm: Clear e after kfree in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl

With the explicit retry loop static analyzers get confused by the
control flow and believe that e could be accessed after kfree. That's
not possible, but it's non-obvious, so let's clear it to NULL.

We already cleared e = NULL at the top of the function, so this is all
in line.
