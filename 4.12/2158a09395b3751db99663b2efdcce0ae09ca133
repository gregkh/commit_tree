clk: ti: fix linker error with !SOC_OMAP4

When none of the OMAP4-generation SoCs are enabled, we run into a link
error for am43xx/am43xx:

drivers/clk/ti/dpll.o: In function `of_ti_am3_dpll_x2_setup':
dpll.c:(.init.text+0xd8): undefined reference to `clkhwops_omap4_dpllmx'

This is easily fixed by adding another #ifdef.

While looking at the code, I also spotted another problem with the
assignment of hw_ops variable that is not used again later. I'm
changing this to setting clk_hw->ops instead, which I guess is what
was intended here.
