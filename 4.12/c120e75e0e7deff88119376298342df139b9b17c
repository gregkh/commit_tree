mtd: nand: use read_oob() instead of cmdfunc() for bad block check

The nand_default_block_markbad() and scan_block_fast() use high
level APIs to get access to the BBM.

On the other hand, nand_block_bad (the default implementation of
->block_bad) calls the lower level ->cmdfunc hook.  This prevents
drivers from using ->ecc.read_oob() even if optimized read operation
is implemented.  Besides, some NAND controllers may protect the BBM
with ECC.
