rcu: Open-code the rcu_cblist_n_lazy_cbs() function

Because the rcu_cblist_n_lazy_cbs() just samples the ->len_lazy counter,
and because the rcu_cblist structure is quite straightforward, it makes
sense to open-code rcu_cblist_n_lazy_cbs(p) as p->len_lazy, cutting out
a level of indirection.  This commit makes this change.
