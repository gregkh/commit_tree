drm/i915: Disable EXEC_OBJECT_ASYNC when doing relocations

If we write a relocation into the buffer, we require our own implicit
synchronisation added after the start of the execbuf, outside of the
user's control. As we may end up clflushing, or doing the patch itself
on the GPU, asynchronously we need to look at the implicit serialisation
on obj->resv and hence need to disable EXEC_OBJECT_ASYNC for this
object.

If the user does trigger a stall for relocations, we make sure the stall
is complete enough so that the batch is not submitted before we complete
those relocations.
