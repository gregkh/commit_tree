powerpc/smp: Remove migrate_irq() custom implementation

Some powerpc platforms use this to move IRQs away from a CPU being
unplugged. This function has several bugs such as not taking the right
locks or failing to NULL check pointers.

There's a new generic function doing exactly the same thing without all
the bugs, so let's use it instead.

mpe: The obvious place for the select of GENERIC_IRQ_MIGRATION is on
HOTPLUG_CPU, but that doesn't work. On some configs PM_SLEEP_SMP will
select HOTPLUG_CPU even though its dependencies are not met, which means
the select of GENERIC_IRQ_MIGRATION doesn't happen. That leads to the
build breaking. Fix it by moving the select of GENERIC_IRQ_MIGRATION to
SMP.
