Fix max_sgl_segments settings for NVME / NVMET

Cannot set NVME segment counts to a large number

The existing module parameter lpfc_sg_seg_cnt is used for both
SCSI and NVME.

Limit the module parameter lpfc_sg_seg_cnt to 128 with the
default being 64 for both NVME and NVMET, assuming NVME is enabled in the
driver for that port. The driver will set max_sgl_segments in the
NVME/NVMET template to lpfc_sg_seg_cnt + 1.
