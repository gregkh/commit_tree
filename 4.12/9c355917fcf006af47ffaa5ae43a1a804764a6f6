powerpc/tracing: Allow tracing of mmap syscalls

Currently sys_mmap() and sys_mmap2() (32-bit only), are not visible to the
syscall tracing machinery. This means users are not able to see the execution of
mmap() syscalls using the syscall tracer.

Fix that by using SYSCALL_DEFINE6 for sys_mmap() and sys_mmap2() so that the
meta-data associated with these syscalls is visible to the syscall tracer.

A side-effect of this change is that the return type has changed from unsigned
long to long. However this should have no effect, the only code in the kernel
which uses the result of these syscalls is in the syscall return path, which is
written in asm and treats the result as unsigned regardless.

Example output:
  cat-3399  [001] ....   196.542410: sys_mmap(addr: 7fff922a0000, len: 20000, prot: 3, flags: 812, fd: 3, offset: 1b0000)
  cat-3399  [001] ....   196.542443: sys_mmap -> 0x7fff922a0000
  cat-3399  [001] ....   196.542668: sys_munmap(addr: 7fff922c0000, len: 6d2c)
  cat-3399  [001] ....   196.542677: sys_munmap -> 0x0
