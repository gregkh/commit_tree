x86/timers: Move simple_udelay_calibration past init_hypervisor_platform

This ensures that adjustments to x86_platform done by the hypervisor
setup is already respected by this simple calibration.

The current user of this, introduced by 1b5aeebf3a92 ("x86/earlyprintk:
Add support for earlyprintk via USB3 debug port"), comes much later
into play.
