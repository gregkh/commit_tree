IB/core: Add support for fd objects

The completion channel we use in verbs infrastructure is FD based.
Previously, we had a separate way to manage this object. Since we
strive for a single way to manage any kind of object in this
infrastructure, we conceptually treat all objects as subclasses
of ib_uobject.

This commit adds the necessary mechanism to support FD based objects
like their IDR counterparts. FD objects release need to be synchronized
with context release. We use the cleanup_mutex on the uverbs_file for
that.
