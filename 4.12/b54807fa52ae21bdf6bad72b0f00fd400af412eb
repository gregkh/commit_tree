sysctl: Remove dead register_sysctl_root

The function no longer does anything.  The is only a single caller of
register_sysctl_root when semantically there should be two.  Remove
this function so that if someone decides this functionality is needed
again it will be obvious all of the callers of setup_sysctl_set need
to be audited and modified appropriately.
