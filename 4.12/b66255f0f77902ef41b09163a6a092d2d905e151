drm/i915: Refactor wakeup of the next breadcrumb waiter

Refactor the common task of updating the first_waiter, serialised with
the interrupt handler. When we update the first_waiter, we also need to
wakeup the new bottom-half in order to complete the actions that we may
have delegated to it (such as checking the irq-seqno coherency or waking
up other lower priority concurrent waiters).
