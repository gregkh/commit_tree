livepatch/x86: add TIF_PATCH_PENDING thread flag

Add the TIF_PATCH_PENDING thread flag to enable the new livepatch
per-task consistency model for x86_64.  The bit getting set indicates
the thread has a pending patch which needs to be applied when the thread
exits the kernel.

The bit is placed in the _TIF_ALLWORK_MASK macro, which results in
exit_to_usermode_loop() calling klp_update_patch_state() when it's set.
