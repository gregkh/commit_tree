drm/i915: Move calling engine->init_hw() to its own function

Just a simple refactor to move a loop and some support code out of
i915_gem_init_hw(). This is in preparation for avoiding a race between
the tasklet writing to ELSP whilst simultaneously being written by
engine->init_hw() following a GPU reset.
