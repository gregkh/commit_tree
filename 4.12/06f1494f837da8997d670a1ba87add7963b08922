arm64: cpu_errata: Allow an erratum to be match for all revisions of a core

Some minor erratum may not be fixed in further revisions of a core,
leading to a situation where the workaround needs to be updated each
time an updated core is released.

Introduce a MIDR_ALL_VERSIONS match helper that will work for all
versions of that MIDR, once and for all.
