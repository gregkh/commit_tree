staging: ks7010: remove superfluous comments

Driver uses custom function comment format. These comments are on
functions with internal likage. Comment string /*--------/* adds
nothing to the driver. Comment 'Wireless Handler' does not have allot
of meaning.

Remove superfluous function comments. Leave comments that add meaning.
