arm64: dts: apq8016-sbc: Add ramoops

Declare a ramoops memory segment to aid debugging for those without UART
access. Verified to carry console log when holding volume down for 15
seconds.

No memory region for ramoops-like support was found downstream, so the
arbitrarily picked region is the last MB of System RAM.
