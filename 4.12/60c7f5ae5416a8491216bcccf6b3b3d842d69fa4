mlx4: removal of frag_sizes[]

We will soon use order-0 pages, and frag truesize will more precisely
match real sizes.

In the new model, we prefer to use <= 2048 bytes fragments, so that
we can use page-recycle technique on PAGE_SIZE=4096 arches.

We will still pack as much frames as possible on arches with big
pages, like PowerPC.
