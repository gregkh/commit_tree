arm64: move !VHE work to end of el2_setup

We only need to initialise sctlr_el1 if we're installing an EL2 stub, so
we may as well defer this until we're doing so. Similarly, we can defer
intialising CPTR_EL2 until then, as we do not access any trapped
functionality as part of el2_setup.

This patch modified el2_setup accordingly, allowing us to remove a
branch and simplify the code flow.
