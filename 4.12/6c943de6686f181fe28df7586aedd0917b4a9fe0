drm/i915: Skip execlists_dequeue() early if the list is empty

Do an early read of the execlists' queue before we take the spinlock and
start checking. This is safe as the first writer to the execlists queue
will cause the tasklet to be run again after a memory barrier.

v2: Keep guc in sync with execlists queue changes
v3: Explain the mb between the tasklet running on one cpu and the
execlist_first update and schedule from a second cpu.
