powerpc: Create asm/debugfs.h and move powerpc_debugfs_root there

powerpc_debugfs_root is the dentry representing the root of the
"powerpc" directory tree in debugfs.

Currently it sits in asm/debug.h, a long with some other things that
have "debug" in the name, but are otherwise unrelated.

Pull it out into a separate header, which also includes linux/debugfs.h,
and convert all the users to include debugfs.h instead of debug.h.
