include: pe.h: allow for use in assembly

Some of the definitions in include/linux/pe.h would be useful for the
EFI stub headers, where values are currently open-coded. Unfortunately
they cannot be used as some structures are also defined in pe.h without
!__ASSEMBLY__ guards.

This patch moves the structure definitions into an #ifdef __ASSEMBLY__
block, so that the common value definitions can be used from assembly.
