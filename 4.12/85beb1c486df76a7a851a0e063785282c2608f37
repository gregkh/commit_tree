powerpc/mm/hash: Check for non-kernel address in get_kernel_vsid()

get_kernel_vsid() has a very stern comment saying that it's only valid
for kernel addresses, but there's nothing in the code to enforce that.

Rather than hoping our callers are well behaved, add a check and return
a VSID of 0 (invalid).
