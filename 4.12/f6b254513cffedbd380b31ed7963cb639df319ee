scsi: ufs: add missing macros for register bits from UFSHCI spec

Add macros for register bits that can be found in JESD223C (v2.1).

Not all registers are defined in ufshci.h (i.e. some are unused whether
macros are defined or undefined), but all the bits for those registers
that are already defined should appear here.
