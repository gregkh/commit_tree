iwlwifi: mvm: tell the firmware about the U-APSD parameters

Newer firmware versions will be able to handle all the
WMM-PS flows internally when we act as a GO. The firwmare
relies on the fact that the drivers puts frames for
different peers in different queues (DQA) to achieve this.
The driver will not be aware of the power state of the peers
anymore.

Tell the firmware about the WMM-PS parameters of earch peer
that connects to us so that it can know what are the
trigger-enabled ACs, the delivery-enableds ACs and the
Service Period length.

This API change is backward compatible since older firmware
versions will simply ignore the newly added values.

Since we don't support ieee80211 TSPECs for now, just copy
the trigger-enabled ACs to the delivery enabled ones.
