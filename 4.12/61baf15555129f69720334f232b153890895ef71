powerpc/64e: Don't place the stack beyond TASK_SIZE

Commit f4ea6dcb08ea ("powerpc/mm: Enable mappings above 128TB") increased
the task size on book3s, and introduced a mechanism to dynamically
control whether a task uses these larger addresses.  While the change to
the task size itself was ifdef-protected to only apply on book3s, the
change to STACK_TOP_USER64 was not.  On book3e, this had the effect of
trying to use addresses up to 128TiB for the stack despite a 64TiB task
size limit -- which broke 64-bit userspace producing the following errors:

Starting init: /sbin/init exists but couldn't execute it (error -14)
Starting init: /bin/sh exists but couldn't execute it (error -14)
Kernel panic - not syncing: No working init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel. See Linux Documentation/admin-guide/init.rst for guidance.
