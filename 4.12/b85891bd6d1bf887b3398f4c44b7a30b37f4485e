drm/amdgpu: IOCTL interface for PRT support v4

Till GFX8 we can only enable PRT support globally, but with the next hardware
generation we can do this on a per page basis.

Keep the interface consistent by adding PRT mappings and enable
support globally on current hardware when the first mapping is made.

v2: disable PRT support delayed and on all error paths
v3: PRT and other permissions are mutal exclusive,
    PRT mappings don't need a BO.
v4: update PRT mappings durign CS as well, make va_flags 64bit
