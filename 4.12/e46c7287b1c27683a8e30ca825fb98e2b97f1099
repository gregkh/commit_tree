nbd: add a basic netlink interface

The existing ioctl interface for configuring NBD devices is a bit
cumbersome and hard to extend.  The other problem is we leave a
userspace app sitting in it's syscall until the device disconnects,
which is less than ideal.

This patch introduces a netlink interface for adding and disconnecting
nbd devices.  This has the benefits of being easily extendable without
breaking older userspace applications, and allows us to configure a nbd
device without leaving a userspace app sitting waiting for the device to
disconnect.

With this interface we also gain the ability to configure more devices
than are preallocated at insmod time.  We also have gained the ability
to not specify a particular device and be provided one for us so that
userspace doesn't need to find a free device to configure.
