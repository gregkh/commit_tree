qed: Add support for PTP resource locking.

The patch adds support for per-port resource lock in favour of PTP.
PTP module acquires/releases the MFW resource lock while enabling/
disabling the PTP on the interface. The PF instance which has the
ownership of this resource lock will get the exclusive access to the
PTP clock functionality on the port.
