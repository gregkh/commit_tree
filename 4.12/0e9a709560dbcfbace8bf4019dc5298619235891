ip6_tunnel, ip6_gre: fix setting of DSCP on encapsulated packets

This fix addresses two problems in the way the DSCP field is formulated
 on the encapsulating header of IPv6 tunnels.
Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195661

1) The IPv6 tunneling code was manipulating the DSCP field of the
 encapsulating packet using the 32b flowlabel. Since the flowlabel is
 only the lower 20b it was incorrect to assume that the upper 12b
 containing the DSCP and ECN fields would remain intact when formulating
 the encapsulating header. This fix handles the 'inherit' and
 'fixed-value' DSCP cases explicitly using the extant dsfield u8 variable.

2) The use of INET_ECN_encapsulate(0, dsfield) in ip6_tnl_xmit was
 incorrect and resulted in the DSCP value always being set to 0.

Commit 90427ef5d2a4 ("ipv6: fix flow labels when the traffic class
 is non-0") caused the regression by masking out the flowlabel
 which exposed the incorrect handling of the DSCP portion of the
 flowlabel in ip6_tunnel and ip6_gre.
