selinux: Fix an uninitialized variable bug

We removed this initialization as a cleanup but it is probably required.

The concern is that "nel" can be zero.  I'm not an expert on SELinux
code but I think it looks possible to write an SELinux policy which
triggers this bug.  GCC doesn't catch this, but my static checker does.
