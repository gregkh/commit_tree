usb: dwc2: Make sure we disconnect the gadget state

I had seen some odd behavior with HiKey's usb-gadget interface
that I finally seemed to have chased down. Basically every other
time I plugged in the OTG port, the gadget interface would
properly initialize. The other times, I'd get a big WARN_ON
in dwc2_hsotg_init_fifo() about the fifo_map not being clear.

Ends up if we don't disconnect the gadget state, the fifo-map
doesn't get cleared properly, which causes WARN_ON messages and
also results in the device not properly being setup as a gadget
every other time the OTG port is connected.

So this patch adds a call to dwc2_hsotg_disconnect() in the
reset path so the state is properly cleared.

With it, the gadget interface initializes properly on every
plug in.
