ASoC: es8328: Simplify rates definition

Currently most of the standard rates are supported by this driver.
Instead of defining each supported rate one by one, we use the SND macro
SNDRV_PCM_RATE_8000_48000. Also adds support for 88.2khz as the codec
supports it and the sys clocks are already supported.
