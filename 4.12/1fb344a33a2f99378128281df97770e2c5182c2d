ASoC: Intel: bxtn: Update DSP core state in D0

In system suspend, firmware needs to be re-downloaded as IMR is cleared.
When firmware is downloaded in D0, core state is not set to running
state causing instability with subsequent D0-D3 cycles.

So set the core state correctly during D0 and check the DSP core state
if not in reset to set the DSP to D3.
