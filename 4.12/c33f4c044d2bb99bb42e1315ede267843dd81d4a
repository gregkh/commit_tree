platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: only register platform device if FUJ02E3 is present

The platform device registered by fujitsu-laptop is registered
unconditionally while sysfs attributes attached to it depend on the
FUJ02E3 ACPI device being present.  Fix this by moving platform device
creation and removal to acpi_fujitsu_laptop_add() and
acpi_fujitsu_laptop_remove(), respectively.
