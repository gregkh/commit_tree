Revert "mm, vmscan: account for skipped pages as a partial scan"

This reverts commit d7f05528eedb047efe2288cff777676b028747b6.

Now that reclaimability of a node is no longer based on the ratio
between pages scanned and theoretically reclaimable pages, we can remove
accounting tricks for pages skipped due to zone constraints.
