staging: ks7010: fix line continuations

Checkpatch emits CHECK: Logical continuations should be on the
previous line. Also the same code section causes checkpatch to emit
WARNING: Avoid multiple line dereference.

Move logical line continuations onto the previous line. Move multiple
line dereferences onto single line.

Make these two changes in a single patch to give review a chance
to critique the final layout of the *complex* logical statement.
