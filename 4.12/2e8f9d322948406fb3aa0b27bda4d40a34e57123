drm/i915: Restore engine->submit_request before unwedging

When we wedge the device, we override engine->submit_request with a nop
to ensure that all in-flight requests are marked in error. However, igt
would like to unwedge the device to test -EIO handling. This requires us
to flush those in-flight requests and restore the original
engine->submit_request.

v2: Use a vfunc to unify enabling request submission to engines
v3: Split new vfunc to a separate patch.
v4: Make the wait interruptible -- the third party fences we wait upon
may be indefinitely broken, so allow the reset to be aborted.
