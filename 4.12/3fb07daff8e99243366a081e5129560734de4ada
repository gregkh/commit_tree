ipv4: add reference counting to metrics

Andrey Konovalov reported crashes in ipv4_mtu()

I could reproduce the issue with KASAN kernels, between
10.246.7.151 and 10.246.7.152 :

1) 20 concurrent netperf -t TCP_RR -H 10.246.7.152 -l 1000 &

2) At the same time run following loop :
while :
do
 ip ro add 10.246.7.152 dev eth0 src 10.246.7.151 mtu 1500
 ip ro del 10.246.7.152 dev eth0 src 10.246.7.151 mtu 1500
done

Cong Wang attempted to add back rt->fi in commit
82486aa6f1b9 ("ipv4: restore rt->fi for reference counting")
but this proved to add some issues that were complex to solve.

Instead, I suggested to add a refcount to the metrics themselves,
being a standalone object (in particular, no reference to other objects)

I tried to make this patch as small as possible to ease its backport,
instead of being super clean. Note that we believe that only ipv4 dst
need to take care of the metric refcount. But if this is wrong,
this patch adds the basic infrastructure to extend this to other
families.

Many thanks to Julian Anastasov for reviewing this patch, and Cong Wang
for his efforts on this problem.
