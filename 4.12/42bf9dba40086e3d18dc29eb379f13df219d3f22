xfs: remove the trailing newline used in the fmt parameter of TP_printk

The trailing newlines wil lead to extra newlines in the trace file
which looks like the following output, so remove them.
>kworker/4:1H-1508  [004] .... 47879.101608: xfs_discard_extent: dev 8:0
>
>kworker/u16:2-238  [004] .... 47879.101725: xfs_extent_busy_clear: dev 8:0
