cpufreq: imx6q: Set max suspend_freq to avoid changes during suspend

If the cpufreq driver tries to modify voltage/freq during suspend/resume
it might need to control an external PMIC via I2C or SPI but those
devices might be already suspended. This issue is likely to happen
whenever the LDOs have their vin-supply set.

To avoid this scenario we just increase cpufreq to the maximum before
suspend.
