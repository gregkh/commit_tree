cxl: Force context lock during EEH flow

During an eeh event when the cxl card is fenced and card sysfs attr
perst_reloads_same_image is set following warning message is seen in the
kernel logs:

  Adapter context unlocked with 0 active contexts
  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  WARNING: CPU: 12 PID: 627 at
  ../drivers/misc/cxl/main.c:325 cxl_adapter_context_unlock+0x60/0x80 [cxl]

Even though this warning is harmless, it clutters the kernel log
during an eeh event. This warning is triggered as the EEH callback
cxl_pci_error_detected doesn't obtain a context-lock before forcibly
detaching all active context and when context-lock is released during
call to cxl_configure_adapter from cxl_pci_slot_reset, a warning in
cxl_adapter_context_unlock is triggered.

To fix this warning, we acquire the adapter context-lock via
cxl_adapter_context_lock() in the eeh callback
cxl_pci_error_detected() once all the virtual AFU PHBs are notified
and their contexts detached. The context-lock is released in
cxl_pci_slot_reset() after the adapter is successfully reconfigured
and before the we call the slot_reset callback on slice attached
device-drivers.
