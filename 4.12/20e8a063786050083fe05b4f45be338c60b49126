xfs: fix up quotacheck buffer list error handling

The quotacheck error handling of the delwri buffer list assumes the
resident buffers are locked and doesn't clear the _XBF_DELWRI_Q flag
on the buffers that are dequeued. This can lead to assert failures
on buffer release and possibly other locking problems.

Move this code to a delwri queue cancel helper function to
encapsulate the logic required to properly release buffers from a
delwri queue. Update the helper to clear the delwri queue flag and
call it from quotacheck.
