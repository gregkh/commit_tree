dt-bindings: Add TI SCI PM Domains

Add a generic power domain implementation, TI SCI PM Domains, that
will hook into the genpd framework and allow the TI SCI protocol to
control device power states.

Also, provide macros representing each device index as understood
by TI SCI to be used in the device node power-domain references.
These are identifiers for the K2G devices managed by the PMMC.
