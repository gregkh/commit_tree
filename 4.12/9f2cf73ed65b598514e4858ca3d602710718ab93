ASoC: bytcr_rt5640: Allow quirk set via module option

The bytcr-rt5640 driver has a few quirk setups depending on the board,
where the quirk value is set by DMI matching.  When you have a new
device to add the support, you often experience to try the different
quirk by trial-and-error.  Or, you may have a development model that
still has no proper DMI string.  In either case, you'd need to compile
the driver at each time.

This patch introduces a module option to override the quirk value on
the fly.  User can boot like snd-soc-sst-bytcr-rt5640.quirk=0x4004 to
override the default value without recompilation.  It's a raw value,
so user needs to check the source code for the meaning of each bit.
