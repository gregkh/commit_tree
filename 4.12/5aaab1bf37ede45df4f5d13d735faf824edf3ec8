ALSA: firewire-motu: enable to read transaction cache via hwdep interface

MOTU FireWire series can transfer messages to registered address. These
messages are transferred for the status of internal clock synchronization
just after starting streams.

When the synchronization is stable, it's 0x01ffffff. Else, it's 0x05ffffff.

This commit adds a functionality for user space applications to receive
content of the message.
