partitions/msdos: FreeBSD UFS2 file systems are not recognized

The code in block/partitions/msdos.c recognizes FreeBSD, OpenBSD
and NetBSD partitions and does a reasonable job picking out OpenBSD
and NetBSD UFS subpartitions.

But for FreeBSD the subpartitions are always "bad".

    Kernel: <bsd:bad subpartition - ignored

Though all 3 of these BSD systems use UFS as a file system, only
FreeBSD uses relative start addresses in the subpartition
declarations.

The following patch fixes this for FreeBSD partitions and leaves
the code for OpenBSD and NetBSD intact:
