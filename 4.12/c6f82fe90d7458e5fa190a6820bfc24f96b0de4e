Revert "f2fs: put allocate_segment after refresh_sit_entry"

This reverts commit 3436c4bdb30de421d46f58c9174669fbcfd40ce0.

This makes a leak to register dirty segments. I reproduced the issue by
modified postmark which injects a lot of file create/delete/update and
finally triggers huge number of SSR allocations.
