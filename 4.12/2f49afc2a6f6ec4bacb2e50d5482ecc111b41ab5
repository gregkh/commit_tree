cpufreq: intel_pstate: Drop struct cpu_defaults

The cpu_defaults structure is redundant, because it only contains
one member of type struct pstate_funcs which can be used directly
instead of struct cpu_defaults.

For this reason, drop struct cpu_defaults, use struct pstate_funcs
directly instead of it where applicable and rename all of the
variables of that type accordingly.
