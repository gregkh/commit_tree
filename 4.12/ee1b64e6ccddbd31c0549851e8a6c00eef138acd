KVM: arm64: Use common debug sysreg definitions

Now that we have common definitions for the debug register encodings,
make the KVM code use these, simplifying the sys_reg_descs table.

The table previously erroneously referred to MDCCSR_EL0 as MDCCSR_EL1.
This is corrected (as is necessary in order to use the common sysreg
definition).
