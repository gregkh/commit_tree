xfs: Fix off-by-in in loop termination in xfs_find_get_desired_pgoff()

There is an off-by-one error in loop termination conditions in
xfs_find_get_desired_pgoff() since 'end' may index a page beyond end of
desired range if 'endoff' is page aligned. It doesn't have any visible
effects but still it is good to fix it.
