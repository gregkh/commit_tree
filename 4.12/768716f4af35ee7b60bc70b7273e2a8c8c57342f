ARM: dts: imx28-duckbill: update to match vendor distributed DT

This patch updates the Duckbill device tree and synchronize it with
the vendor distributed file. The changes in mostly pin-muxing stuff,
but also some minor fixes. In detail:
- enable SPI pins
- enable I2C pins
- enable UART pins
- enable LRADC pin
- adjust USB DR mode
- add default triggers for LEDs
- get rid of regulators simple-bus container
- adjust phy reset duration
  According to phy datasheet, 25ms are sufficient. This also reduces
  the time to boot the system.
