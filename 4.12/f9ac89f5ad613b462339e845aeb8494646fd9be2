platform/x86: acer-wmi: setup accelerometer when ACPI device was found

The 98d610c3739a patch was introduced since v4.11-rc1 that it causes
that the accelerometer input device will not be created on workable
machines because the HID string comparing logic is wrong.

And, the patch doesn't prevent that the accelerometer input device
be created on the machines that have no BST0001. That's because
the acpi_get_devices() returns success even it didn't find any
match device.

This patch fixed the HID string comparing logic of BST0001 device.
And, it also makes sure that the acpi_get_devices() returns
acpi_handle for BST0001.
