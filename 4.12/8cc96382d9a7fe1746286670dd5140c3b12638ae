audit: use kmem_cache to manage the audit_buffer cache

The audit subsystem implemented its own buffer cache mechanism which
is a bit silly these days when we could use the kmem_cache construct.

Some credit is due to Florian Westphal for originally proposing that
we remove the audit cache implementation in favor of simple
kmalloc()/kfree() calls, but I would rather have a dedicated slab
cache to ease debugging and future stats/performance work.
