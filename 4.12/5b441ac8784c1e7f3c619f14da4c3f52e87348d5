mpls: allow TTL propagation to IP packets to be configured

Provide the ability to control on a per-route basis whether the TTL
value from an MPLS packet is propagated to an IPv4/IPv6 packet when
the last label is popped as per the theoretical model in RFC 3443
through a new route attribute, RTA_TTL_PROPAGATE which can be 0 to
mean disable propagation and 1 to mean enable propagation.

In order to provide the ability to change the behaviour for packets
arriving with IPv4/IPv6 Explicit Null labels and to provide an easy
way for a user to change the behaviour for all existing routes without
having to reprogram them, a global knob is provided. This is done
through the addition of a new per-namespace sysctl,
"net.mpls.ip_ttl_propagate", which defaults to enabled. If the
per-route attribute is set (either enabled or disabled) then it
overrides the global configuration.
