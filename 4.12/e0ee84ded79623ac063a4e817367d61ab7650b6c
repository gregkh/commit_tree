net sched actions: Complete the JUMPX opcode

per discussion at netconf/netdev:
When we have an action that is capable of branching (example a policer),
we can achieve a continuation of the action graph by programming a
"continue" where we find an exact replica of the same filter rule with a lower
priority and the remainder of the action graph. When you have 100s of thousands
of filters which require such a feature it gets very inefficient to do two
lookups.

This patch completes a leftover feature of action codes. Its time has come.

Example below where a user labels packets with a different skbmark on ingress
of a port depending on whether they have/not exceeded the configured rate.
This mark is then used to make further decisions on some egress port.

 #rate control, very low so we can easily see the effect
sudo $TC actions add action police rate 1kbit burst 90k \
conform-exceed pipe/jump 2 index 10
 # skbedit index 11 will be used if the user conforms
sudo $TC actions add action skbedit mark 11 ok index 11
 # skbedit index 12 will be used if the user does not conform
sudo $TC actions add action skbedit mark 12 ok index 12

 #lets bind the user ..
sudo $TC filter add dev $ETH parent ffff: protocol ip prio 8 u32 \
match ip dst 127.0.0.8/32 flowid 1:10 \
action police index 10 \
action skbedit index 11 \
action skbedit index 12

 #run a ping -f and see what happens..

Not bad, about 28% non-conforming packets..
