locks: Set FL_CLOSE when removing flock locks on close()

Set FL_CLOSE in fl_flags as in locks_remove_posix() when clearing locks.
NFS will check for this flag to ensure an unlock is sent in a following
patch.

Fuse handles flock and posix locks differently for FL_CLOSE, and so
requires a fixup to retain the existing behavior for flock.
