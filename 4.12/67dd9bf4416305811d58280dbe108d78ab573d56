cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add update_util callback to pstate_funcs

Avoid using extra function pointers during P-state selection by
dropping the get_target_pstate member from struct pstate_funcs,
adding a new update_util callback to it (to be registered with
the CPU scheduler as the utilization update callback in the active
mode) and reworking the utilization update callback routines to
invoke specific P-state selection functions directly.
