tracing: Postpone tracer start-up tests till the system is more robust

As tracing can now be enabled very early in boot up, even before some
critical system services (like scheduling), do not run the tracer selftests
until after early_initcall() is performed. If a tracer is registered before
such time, it is saved off in a list and the test is run when the system is
able to handle more diverse functions.
