ARM: dts: imx53-qsrb: Pulldown PMIC IRQ pin

Currently the following errors are seen:

[   14.015056] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6
[   27.321093] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6
[   27.411681] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6
[   27.456281] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6
[   30.527106] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6
[   36.596900] mc13xxx 0-0008: Failed to read IRQ status: -6

Also when reading the interrupts via 'cat /proc/interrupts' the
PMIC GPIO interrupt counter does not stop increasing.

The reason for the storm of interrupts is that the PUS field of
register IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_CSI0_DAT5 is currently configured as:
10 : 100k pullup

and the PMIC interrupt is being registered as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH type,
which is the correct type as per the MC34708 datasheet.

Use the default power on value for the IOMUX, which sets PUS field as:
00: 360k pull down

This prevents the spurious PMIC interrupts from happening.

Commit e1ffceb078c6 ("ARM: imx53: qsrb: fix PMIC interrupt level")
correctly described the irq type as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, but
missed to update the IOMUX of the PMIC GPIO as pull down.
