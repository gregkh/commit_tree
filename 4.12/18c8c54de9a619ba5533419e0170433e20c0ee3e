macvlan: Let passthru macvlan correctly restore lower mac address

Passthru macvlans directly change the mac address of the lower
level device.  That's OK, but after the macvlan is deleted,
the lower device is left with changed address and one needs to
reboot to bring back the origina HW addresses.

This scenario is actually quite common with passthru macvtap devices.

This patch attempts to solve this, by storing the mac address
of the lower device in macvlan_port structure and keeping track of
it through the changes.

After this patch, any changes to the lower device mac address
done trough the macvlan device, will be reverted back.  Any
changs done directly to the lower device mac address will be kept.
