drm/radeon: Refuse to migrate a prime BO to VRAM. (v2)

BOs shared via dma-buf, either imported or exported, cannot sensibly be migrated to VRAM
without breaking the dma-buf sharing. Refuse userspace requests to migrate to VRAM,
ensure such BOs are not migrated during command submission, and refuse to pin them
to VRAM.

v2: Don't pin BOs in GTT. Instead, refuse to migrate BOs to VRAM.
