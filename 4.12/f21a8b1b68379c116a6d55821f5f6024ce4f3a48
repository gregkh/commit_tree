PCI: aardvark: Move to MSI handling using generic MSI support

The MSI support introduced with the initial Aardvark driver was based
on the msi_controller structure and the of_pci_msi_chip_add() /
of_pci_find_msi_chip_by_node() API, which are being deprecated in
favor of the generic MSI support.

Update the Aardvark driver to use the generic MSI support.
