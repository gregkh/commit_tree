bnxt_en: Add missing logic to handle TPA end error conditions.

When we get a TPA_END completion to handle a completed LRO packet, it
is possible that hardware would indicate errors.  The current code is
not checking for the error condition.  Define the proper error bits and
the macro to check for this error and abort properly.
