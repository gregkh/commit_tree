ARM: dts: r8a73a4: Add INTC-SYS clock to device tree

Link the ARM GIC to the INTC-SYS module clock and the C4 power domain,
so it can be power managed using that clock in the future.

Note that currently the GIC-400 driver doesn't support module clocks nor
Runtime PM, so this must be handled as a critical clock.
