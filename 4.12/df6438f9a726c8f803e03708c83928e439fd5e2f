selftests: lib.mk: define CLEAN macro to allow Makefiles to override clean

Define CLEAN macro to allow Makefiles to override common clean target
in lib.mk. This will help fix the following failures:

warning: overriding recipe for target 'clean'
../lib.mk:55: warning: ignoring old recipe for target 'clean'
