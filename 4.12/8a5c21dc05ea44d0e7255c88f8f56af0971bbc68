clocksource: arm_arch_timer: rename type macros

In preparation for moving the type macros out into a header, rename
these so they are namespaced w.r.t. the arch timer. We'll apply the same
prefix to other definitions in subsequent patches. This will aid
consistency and avoid potential name clahses when this move occurs.

No functional change.
