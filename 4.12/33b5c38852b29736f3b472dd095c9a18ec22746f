arm: KVM: Allow unaligned accesses at HYP

We currently have the HSCTLR.A bit set, trapping unaligned accesses
at HYP, but we're not really prepared to deal with it.

Since the rest of the kernel is pretty happy about that, let's follow
its example and set HSCTLR.A to zero. Modern CPUs don't really care.
