livepatch: Make livepatch dependent on !TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS

If TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS is enabled, all unneeded exported symbols are made
unexported. Two-pass build of the kernel is done to find out which
symbols are needed based on a configuration. This effectively
complicates things for out-of-tree modules.

Livepatch exports functions to (un)register and enable/disable a live
patch. The only in-tree module which uses these functions is a sample in
samples/livepatch/. If the sample is disabled, the functions are
trimmed and out-of-tree live patches cannot be built.

Note that live patches are intended to be built out-of-tree.
