mac80211: use DECLARE_EWMA for mesh_fail_avg

As moving average is not considering fractional part, it will
get stuck at the same level after certain state. For example,
with current values, it can get stuck at 96. Fortunately the
current threshold 95%, but if it were increased to 96 or more
mesh paths would never be deactivated. Fix failure average
movement by using EWMA helpers, which does take into account
fractional parts.

 the limited range that we will feed into it, adjust to new API]
