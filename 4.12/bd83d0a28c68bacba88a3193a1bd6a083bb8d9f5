md/raid5: call bio_endio() directly rather than queueing for later.

We currently gather bios that need to be returned into a bio_list
and call bio_endio() on them all together.
The original reason for this was to avoid making the calls while
holding a spinlock.
Locking has changed a lot since then, and that reason is no longer
valid.

So discard return_io() and various return_bi lists, and just call
bio_endio() directly as needed.
