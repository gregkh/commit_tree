mm: clarify why we want kmalloc before falling backto vmallock

While converting drm_[cm]alloc* helpers to kvmalloc* variants Chris
Wilson has wondered why we want to try kmalloc before vmalloc fallback
even for larger allocations requests.  Let's clarify that one larger
physically contiguous block is less likely to fragment memory than many
scattered pages which can prevent more large blocks from being created.
