xen: adjust early dom0 p2m handling to xen hypervisor behavior

When booted as pv-guest the p2m list presented by the Xen is already
mapped to virtual addresses. In dom0 case the hypervisor might make use
of 2M- or 1G-pages for this mapping. Unfortunately while being properly
aligned in virtual and machine address space, those pages might not be
aligned properly in guest physical address space.

So when trying to obtain the guest physical address of such a page
pud_pfn() and pmd_pfn() must be avoided as those will mask away guest
physical address bits not being zero in this special case.
