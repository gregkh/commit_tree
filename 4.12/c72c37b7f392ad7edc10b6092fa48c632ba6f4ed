iwlwifi: mvm: Fix command queue number on d0i3 flow

During d0i3 flow we flush all the queue except from the command queue.
Currently, in this flow the command queue is hard coded to 9.
In DQA the command queue number has changed from 9 to 0.
Fix that.

This fixes a problem in runtime PM resume flow.
