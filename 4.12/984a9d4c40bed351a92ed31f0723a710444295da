      target: Fix VERIFY and WRITE VERIFY command parsing

This patch broke existing behaviour for WRITE_VERIFY because
it dropped the original SCF_SCSI_DATA_CDB assignment for
bytchk = 0 so target_cmd_size_check() no longer rejected
this case, allowing an overflow case to trigger an OOPs
in iscsi-target.

Since the short term and long term fixes are still being
discussed, revert it for now since it's late in the merge
window and try again in v4.13-rc1.
