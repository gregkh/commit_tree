net: thunderx: Optimize RBDR descriptor handling

Receive buffer's physical address or iova will anyway not
go beyond 49bits, since it is the max supported HW address.
As per perf, updating bitfields i.e buf_addr:42 in RBDR
descriptor entry consumes lots of cpu cycles, hence changed
it to a 64bit field with alignment requirements taken care of.
