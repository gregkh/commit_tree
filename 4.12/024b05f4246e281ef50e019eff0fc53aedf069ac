i40e: don't hold RTNL lock while waiting for VF reset to finish

We made some effort to reduce the RTNL lock scope when resetting and
rebuilding the PF. Unfortunately we still held the RTNL lock during the
VF reset operation, which meant that multiple PFs could not reset in
parallel due to the global lock. For now, further reduce the scope by
not holding the RTNL lock while resetting VFs. This allows multiple PFs
to reset in a timely manner.
