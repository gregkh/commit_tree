x86/mce: Init some CPU features early

When the MCA banks in __mcheck_cpu_init_generic() are polled for leftover
errors logged during boot or from the previous boot, its required to have
CPU features detected sufficiently so that the reading out and handling of
those early errors is done correctly.

If those features are not available, the decoding may miss some information
and get incomplete errors logged. For example, on SMCA systems the MCA_IPID
and MCA_SYND registers are not logged and MCA_ADDR is not masked
appropriately.

To cure that, do a subset of the basic feature detection early while the
rest happens in its usual place in __mcheck_cpu_init_vendor().
