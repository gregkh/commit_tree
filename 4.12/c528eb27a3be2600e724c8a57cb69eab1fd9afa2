gpio: mvebu: fix blink counter register selection

The blink counter A was always selected because 0 was forced in the
blink select counter register.
The variable 'set' was obviously there to be used as the register value,
selecting the B counter when id==1 and A counter when id==0.

Tested on clearfog-pro (Marvell 88F6828)
