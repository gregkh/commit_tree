x86/platform/uv/BAU: Implement uv4_wait_completion with read_status

UV4 does not employ a software-timeout as in previous generations so a new
wait_completion routine without this logic is required. Certain completion
statuses require the AUX status bit in addition to ERROR and BUSY.

Add the read_status routine to construct the full completion status. Use
read_status in the uv4_wait_completion routine to handle all possible
completion statuses.
