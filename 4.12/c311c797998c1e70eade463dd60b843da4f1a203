cpumask: make "nr_cpumask_bits" unsigned

Bit searching functions accept "unsigned long" indices but
"nr_cpumask_bits" is "int" which is signed, so inevitable sign
extensions occur on x86_64.  Those MOVSX are #1 MOVSX bloat by number of
uses across whole kernel.

Change "nr_cpumask_bits" to unsigned, this number can't be negative
after all.  It allows to do implicit zero-extension on x86_64 without
MOVSX.

Change signed comparisons into unsigned comparisons where necessary.

Other uses looks fine because it is either argument passed to a function
or comparison is already unsigned.

Same arguments apply to "nr_cpu_ids" but I haven't yet found enough
courage to delve into this issue (and proper fix may require new type
"cpu_t" which is whole separate story).
