ACPI / CPPC: add sysfs entries for CPPC perf capabilities

Computed delivered performance using CPPC feedback counters are in the
CPPC abstract scale, whereas cppc_cpufreq driver operates in KHz scale.
Exposing the CPPC performance capabilities (highest,lowest, nominal,
lowest non-linear) will allow userspace to figure out the conversion
factor from CPPC abstract scale to KHz.

Also rename ctr_wrap_time to wraparound_time so that show_cppc_data()
macro will work with it.
