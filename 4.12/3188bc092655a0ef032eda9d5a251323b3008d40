staging: ks7010: remove switch statement

Switch statement uses one [trivial] case and a default case holding
bulk of code. We can swap the switch statement with an if/return
statement as replacement for the original switch. This can be done
without changing the program logic.

Remove switch statement. Use original switch parameter as conditional
and return if conditional evaluates to true. Reduce level of
indentation. Do not change the program logic.
