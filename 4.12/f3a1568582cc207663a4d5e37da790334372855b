ovl: mark upper merge dir with type origin entries "impure"

An upper dir is marked "impure" to let ovl_iterate() know that this
directory may contain non pure upper entries whose d_ino may need to be
read from the origin inode.

We already mark a non-merge dir "impure" when moving a non-pure child
entry inside it, to let ovl_iterate() know not to iterate the non-merge
dir directly.

Mark also a merge dir "impure" when moving a non-pure child entry inside
it and when copying up a child entry inside it.

This can be used to optimize ovl_iterate() to perform a "pure merge" of
upper and lower directories, merging the content of the directories,
without having to read d_ino from origin inodes.
