qed: Deprecate VF multiple queue-stop

The PF<->VF interface allows for the VF to request
multiple queues closure via a single message, but this has
never been used by any official driver.

We now deprecate this option, forcing each queue close
to arrive via a different command; This would be required
for future TLVs that are going to extend the queue TLVs with
additional information on a per-queue basis.
