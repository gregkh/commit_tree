powerpc/book3s64: Move PPC_DT_CPU_FTRs and enable it by default

The PPC_DT_CPU_FTRs is a bit misplaced in menuconfig, it shows up with
other general kernel options. It's really more at home in the "Platform
Support" section, so move it there.

Also enable it by default, for Book3s 64. It does mostly nothing unless
the device tree properties are found, and we will want it enabled
eventually in distro kernels, so turn it on to start getting more
testing.
