scsi: sd: Return SUCCESS in sd_eh_action() after device offline

If sd_eh_action() decides to take the device offline there is
no point in returning FAILED, as taking the device offline
is the ultimate step in SCSI EH anyway.
So further escalation via SCSI EH is not likely to make a
difference and we can as well return SUCCESS.
