arm64: dts: juno: add information about L1 and L2 caches

Commit a8d4636f96ad ("arm64: cacheinfo: Remove CCSIDR-based cache
information probing") removed mechanism to extract cache information
based on CCSIDR register as the architecture explicitly states no
inference about the actual sizes of caches based on CCSIDR registers.

Commit 9a802431c527 ("arm64: cacheinfo: add support to override cache
levels via device tree") had already provided options to override cache
information from the device tree.

This patch adds the information about L1 and L2 caches on all variants
of Juno platform.
