srcu: Move to state-based grace-period sequencing

The current SRCU grace-period processing might never reach the last
portion of srcu_advance_batches().  This is OK given the current
implementation, as the first portion, up to the try_check_zero()
following the srcu_flip() is sufficient to drive grace periods forward.
However, it has the unfortunate side-effect of making it impossible to
determine when a given grace period has ended, and it will be necessary
to efficiently trace ends of grace periods in order to efficiently handle
per-CPU SRCU callback lists.

This commit therefore adds states to the SRCU grace-period processing,
so that the end of a given SRCU grace period is marked by the transition
to the SRCU_STATE_DONE state.
