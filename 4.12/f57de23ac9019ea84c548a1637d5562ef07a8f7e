blk-mq-debugfs: get rid of a bunch of boilerplate

A large part of blk-mq-debugfs.c is file_operations and seq_file
boilerplate. This sucks as is but will suck even more when schedulers
can define their own debugfs entries. Factor it all out into a single
blk_mq_debugfs_fops which multiplexes as needed. We store the
request_queue, blk_mq_hw_ctx, or blk_mq_ctx in the parent directory
dentry, which is kind of hacky, but it works.
