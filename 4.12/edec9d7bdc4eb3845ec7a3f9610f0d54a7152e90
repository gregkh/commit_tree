KVM: MIPS/VZ: Trace guest mode changes

Create a trace event for guest mode changes, and enable VZ's
GuestCtl0.MC bit after the trace event is enabled to trap all guest mode
changes.

The MC bit causes Guest Hardware Field Change (GHFC) exceptions whenever
a guest mode change occurs (such as an exception entry or return from
exception), so we need to handle this exception now. The MC bit is only
enabled when restoring register state, so enabling the trace event won't
take immediate effect.

Tracing guest mode changes can be particularly handy when trying to work
out what a guest OS gets up to before something goes wrong, especially
if the problem occurs as a result of some previous guest userland
exception which would otherwise be invisible in the trace.
