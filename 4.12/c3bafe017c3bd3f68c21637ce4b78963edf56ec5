gpio: aspeed: Add open-source and open-drain support

As per the datasheet, manage the IO and value states to implement
open-source/open-drain, but do this by falling back to gpiolib's
emulation.

This commit simply makes the behaviour explicit for clarity, rather than
relying on the implicit return of -ENOTSUPP to trigger the emulation.
