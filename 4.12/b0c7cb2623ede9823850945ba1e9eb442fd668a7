staging: android: ion: Break the ABI in the name of forward progress

Several of the Ion ioctls were designed in such a way that they
necessitate compat ioctls. We're breaking a bunch of other ABIs and
cleaning stuff up anyway so let's follow the ioctl guidelines and clean
things up while everyone is busy converting things over anyway. As part
of this, also remove the useless alignment field from the allocation
structure.
