arm64: arch_timer: Allow erratum matching with ACPI OEM information

Just as we're able to identify a broken platform using some DT
information, let's enable a way to spot the offenders with ACPI.

The difference is that we can only match on some OEM info instead
of implementation-specific properties. So in order to avoid the
insane multiplication of errata structures, we allow an array
of OEM descriptions to be attached to an erratum structure.
