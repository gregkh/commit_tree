drm: Remove the struct drm_device platformdev field

The field contains a pointer to the parent platform device of the DRM
device. As struct drm_device also contains a dev pointer to the struct
device embedded in the platform_device structure, the platformdev field
is redundant. Remove it and use the dev pointer directly.
