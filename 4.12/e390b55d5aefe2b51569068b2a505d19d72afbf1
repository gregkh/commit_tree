bpf: make bpf_xdp_adjust_head support mandatory

Now that also the last in-tree user of the xdp_adjust_head bit has
been removed, we can remove the flag from struct bpf_prog altogether.

This, at the same time, also makes sure that any future driver for
XDP comes with bpf_xdp_adjust_head() support right away.

A rejection based on this flag would also mean that tail calls
couldn't be used with such driver as per c2002f983767 ("bpf: fix
checking xdp_adjust_head on tail calls") fix, thus lets not allow
for it in the first place.
