drm: Fix deadlock retry loop in page_flip_ioctl

I failed to properly onion-wrap the unwind code: We acquire the vblank
reference before we start with the wait-wound locking dance, hence we
must make sure we retry before we drop the reference. Oops.

v2: The vblank_put must be after the frambuffer_put (Michel). I suck at
unwrapping code that doesn't use separate labels for each stage, but
checks each pointer first ... While re-reading everything I also
realized that we must clean up the fb refcounts, and specifically
plane->old_fb before we drop the locks, either in the final unlocking,
or in the w/w retry path. Hence the correct fix is to drop the
vblank_put to the very bottom.
