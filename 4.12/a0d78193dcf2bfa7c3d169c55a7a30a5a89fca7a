IB/ucm: utilize new cdev_device_add helper function

The use after free is not triggerable here because the cdev holds
the module lock and the only device_unregister is only triggered by
module unload, however make the change for consistency.

To make this work the cdev_del needs to move out of the struct device
release function.

This cleans up the error path significantly and thus also fixes a minor
bug where the devnum would not be released if cdev_add failed.
