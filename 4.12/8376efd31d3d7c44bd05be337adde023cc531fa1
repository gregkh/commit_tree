x86, pmem: Fix cache flushing for iovec write < 8 bytes

Commit 11e63f6d920d added cache flushing for unaligned writes from an
iovec, covering the first and last cache line of a >= 8 byte write and
the first cache line of a < 8 byte write.  But an unaligned write of
2-7 bytes can still cover two cache lines, so make sure we flush both
in that case.
