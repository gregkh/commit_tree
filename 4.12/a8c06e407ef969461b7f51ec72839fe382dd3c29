usb: separate out sysdev pointer from usb_bus

For xhci-hcd platform device, all the DMA parameters are not
configured properly, notably dma ops for dwc3 devices.

The idea here is that you pass in the parent of_node along with
the child device pointer, so it would behave exactly like the
parent already does. The difference is that it also handles all
the other attributes besides the mask.

sysdev will represent the physical device, as seen from firmware
or bus.Splitting the usb_bus->controller field into the
Linux-internal device (used for the sysfs hierarchy, for printks
and for power management) and a new pointer (used for DMA,
DT enumeration and phy lookup) probably covers all that we really
need.
