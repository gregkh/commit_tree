KVM: arm/arm64: Get rid of its->initialized field

The its->initialized doesn't bring much to the table, and creates
unnecessary ordering between setting the address and initializing it
(which amounts to exactly nothing).

Let's kill it altogether, making KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT the no-op
it deserves to be.
