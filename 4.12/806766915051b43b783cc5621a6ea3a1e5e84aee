ARM: qcom_defconfig: Enable Qualcomm remoteproc and related drivers

An adsp-pil node is present in at least the MSM8974 SoC. Simply enable
all Qualcomm remoteproc drivers to avoid more work in the future.

The SMP2P driver is required for adsp-pil to initialize correctly.

Enable the SMSM driver at Bjorn Andersson's request: "We also need
CONFIG_QCOM_SMSM=y here, its currently used to signal state of the ring
buffers for WiFi."

CONFIG_QCOM_WCNSS_CTRL is required to load firmware/configuration data
into the WCNSS core, which handles WiFi and Bluetooth.
