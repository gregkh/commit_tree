KVM: s390: gaccess: fix real-space designation asce handling for gmap shadows

For real-space designation asces the asce origin part is only a token.
The asce token origin must not be used to generate an effective
address for storage references. This however is erroneously done
within kvm_s390_shadow_tables().

Furthermore within the same function the wrong parts of virtual
addresses are used to generate a corresponding real address
(e.g. the region second index is used as region first index).

Both of the above can result in incorrect address translations. Only
for real space designations with a token origin of zero and addresses
below one megabyte the translation was correct.

Furthermore replace a "!asce.r" statement with a "!*fake" statement to
make it more obvious that a specific condition has nothing to do with
the architecture, but with the fake handling of real space designations.
