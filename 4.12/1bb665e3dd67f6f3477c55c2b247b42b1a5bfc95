nfp: fix invalid area detection

Core should detect when someone is trying to request an access
window which is too large for a given type of access.  Otherwise
the requester will be put on a wait queue for ever without any
error message.

Add const qualifiers to clarify that we are only looking at read-
-only members in relevant functions.
