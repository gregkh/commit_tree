wil6210: remove HALP voting in debugfs ioblob

debugfs ioblob function is called by the FW logs scripts
to copy the FW logs via PCIe.
As the FW logs collection is done in parallel to the operational
11AD actions, the HALP voting can take place during 11AD reset flow
and other sensitive scenarios.
To prevent that, remove HALP voting from the ioblob function.
