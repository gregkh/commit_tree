ceph: check that the new inode size is within limits in ceph_fallocate()

Currently the ceph client doesn't respect the rlimit in fallocate.  This
means that a user can allocate a file with size > RLIMIT_FSIZE.  This
patch adds the call to inode_newsize_ok() to verify filesystem limits and
ulimits.  This should make ceph successfully run xfstest generic/228.
