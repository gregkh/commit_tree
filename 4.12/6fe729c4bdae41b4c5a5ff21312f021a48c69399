serdev: Add serdev_device_write subroutine

Add serdev_device_write() a blocking call allowing to transfer
arbitraty amount of data (potentially exceeding amount that
serdev_device_write_buf can process in a single call)

To support that, also add serdev_device_write_wakeup().

Drivers wanting to use full extent of serdev_device_write
functionality are expected to provide serdev_device_write_wakeup() as
a sole handler of .write_wakeup event or call it as a part of driver's
custom .write_wakeup code.

Because serdev_device_write() subroutine is a superset of
serdev_device_write_buf() the patch re-impelements latter is terms of
the former. For drivers wanting to just use serdev_device_write_buf()
.write_wakeup handler is optional.
