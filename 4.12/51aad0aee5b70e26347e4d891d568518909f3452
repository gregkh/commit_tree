trace: make trace_hwlat timestamp y2038 safe

struct timespec is not y2038 safe on 32 bit machines and needs to be
replaced by struct timespec64 in order to represent times beyond year
2038 on such machines.

Fix all the timestamp representation in struct trace_hwlat and all the
corresponding implementations.
