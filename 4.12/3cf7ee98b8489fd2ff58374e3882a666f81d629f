drivers/perf: arm_pmu: move irq request/free into probe

Currently we request (and potentially free) all IRQs for a given PMU in
cpu_pmu_init(). This works for platform/DT probing today, but it doesn't
fit ACPI well as we don't have all our affinity data up-front.

In preparation for ACPI support, fold the IRQ request/free into
arm_pmu_device_probe(), which will remain specific to platform/DT
probing.
