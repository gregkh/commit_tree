staging: ks7010: fix checkpatch BRACES

Checkpatch emits CHECK: Unbalanced braces around else
statement. Statements in question are single statements so we do not
need braces. Checkpatch also warns about multiple line dereference for
this code.

Fix if/else/else if statement use of braces. Fix function argument layout
at the same time since it is the same statement.
