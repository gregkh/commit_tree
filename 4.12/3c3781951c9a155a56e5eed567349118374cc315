xfs: Allow user to kill fstrim process

fstrim can take really long time on big, slow device or on file system
with a lots of allocation groups. Currently there is no way for the user
to cancell the operation. This patch makes it possible for the user to
kill fstrim pocess by adding the check for fatal_signal_pending() in
xfs_trim_extents().
