staging: gdm724x: Replace ternary operator with min macro

Use macro min() to get the minimum of two values for
brevity and readability. The macro MUX_TX_MAX_SIZE
has a value of 2048 which is well within the integer
limits. This check was done manually.

Found using Coccinelle:
@@ type T; T x; T y; @@
(
- x < y ? x : y
+ min(x,y)
|
- x > y ? x : y
+ max(x,y)
)
