treewide: move set_memory_* functions away from cacheflush.h

Patch series "set_memory_* functions header refactor", v3.

The set_memory_* APIs came out of a desire to have a better way to
change memory attributes.  Many of these attributes were linked to cache
functionality so the prototypes were put in cacheflush.h.  These days,
the APIs have grown and have a much wider use than just cache APIs.  To
support this growth, split off set_memory_* and friends into a separate
header file to avoid growing cacheflush.h for APIs that have nothing to
do with caches.
