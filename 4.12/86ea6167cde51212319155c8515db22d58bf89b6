staging: ks7010: fix spelling of Michael MIC

Driver mixes spelling michael and michel in symbol names and
comments. Michael here references the IEEE 802.11i Message Integrity
Code. It is incorrect to spell it michel and confusing having two
spellings for the same thing.

Change michel -> micheal in both symbol names and comments.
