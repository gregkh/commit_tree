tty: pl011: use "qdf2400_e44" as the earlycon name for QDF2400 E44

Define a new early console name for Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies
QDF2400 SOCs affected by erratum 44, instead of piggy-backing on "pl011".
Previously, to enable traditional (non-SPCR) earlycon, the documentation
said to specify "earlycon=pl011,<address>,qdf2400_e44", but the code was
broken and this didn't actually work.

So instead, the method for specifying the E44 work-around with traditional
earlycon is "earlycon=qdf2400_e44,<address>".  Both methods of earlycon
are now enabled with the same function.
