raid5-ppl: support disk hot add/remove with PPL

Add a function to modify the log by removing an rdev when a drive fails
or adding when a spare/replacement is activated as a raid member.

Removing a disk just clears the child log rdev pointer. No new stripes
will be accepted for this child log in ppl_write_stripe() and running io
units will be processed without writing PPL to the device.

Adding a disk sets the child log rdev pointer and writes an empty PPL
header.
