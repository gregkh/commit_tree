platform/x86: intel-hid: use devm_input_allocate_device() for HID events input device

intel_hid_input_setup() is only called from the platform driver's .probe
callback.  Use the devm variant of input_allocate_device() for
allocating memory for the HID events input device in order to simplify
two error paths and get rid of intel_hid_input_destroy().
