staging: bcm2835-camera: Create struct mmal_es_format_local to mirror struct mmal_es_format

The struct struct mmal_es_format is passed between the firmware which has
pointers.  A local version of mmal_es_format is also used.

Luckly, the two versions are always memberwise copied from each other
so simply have different structures for the local and msg versions.
