staging: ks7010: remove unnecessary address check

Currently source and destination ethernet addresses are checked twice,
once in hostif_data_indication() and then again in
hostif_data_indication_wpa(). The second of these functions is called
from the first right after the address check is done. This check is a
duplicate and is unnecessary.

Remove unnecessary duplicate address check.
