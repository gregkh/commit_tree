cpufreq: intel_pstate: Drop redundant wrapper function

intel_pstate_hwp_set_policy() is a wrapper around
intel_pstate_hwp_set(), but the only value it adds is to check
hwp_active before calling the latter and one of its two callers
has already checked hwp_active before that happens, so in that
code path the additional check is redundant and using the wrapper
is rather pointless.

For this reason, drop intel_pstate_hwp_set_policy() and make its
callers invoke intel_pstate_hwp_set() directly (after checking
hwp_active).
