staging: typec: fusb302: refactor resume retry mechanism

The i2c functions need to test the pm_suspend state and do, if needed, some
retry before i2c operations. This code was repeated 4x.

To isolate this, create a new function to check suspend state and call it in
every need place.

As at it, move the error message from pr_err to dev_err.
