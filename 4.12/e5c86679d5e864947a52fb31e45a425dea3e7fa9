xtensa: don't use linux IRQ #0

Linux IRQ #0 is reserved for error reporting and may not be used.
Increase NR_IRQS for one additional slot and increase
irq_domain_add_legacy parameter first_irq value to 1, so that linux
IRQ #0 is not associated with hardware IRQ #0 in legacy IRQ domains.
Introduce macro XTENSA_PIC_LINUX_IRQ for static translation of xtensa
PIC hardware IRQ # to linux IRQ #. Use this macro in XTFPGA platform
data definitions.

This fixes inability to use hardware IRQ #0 in configurations that don't
use device tree and allows for non-identity mapping between linux IRQ #
and hardware IRQ #.
