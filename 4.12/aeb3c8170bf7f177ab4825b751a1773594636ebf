Add Fabric assigned WWN support.

Adding support for Fabric assigned WWPN and WWNN.

Firmware sends first FLOGI to fabric with vendor version changes.
On link up driver gets updated service parameter with FAWWN assigned port
name.  Driver sends 2nd FLOGI with updated fawwpn and modifies the
vport->fc_portname in driver.

Note:
Soft wwpn will not be allowed when fawwpn is enabled.
