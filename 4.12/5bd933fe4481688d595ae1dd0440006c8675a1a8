module: set .init_array alignment to 8

The proper idiom for aligning linker sections in modules is different
than for built-in sections.  ". = ALIGN();" followed by a forced
output address of 0 does nothing, as forcing the address changes the
value of ".".

Use output section alignment specifier instead.
