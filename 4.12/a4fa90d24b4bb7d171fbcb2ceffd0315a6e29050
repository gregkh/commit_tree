clk: rockchip: fix up rk3368 timer-ids

The timer-ids are wrong compared to the manual, probably due a simple
copy-paste mistake from the otherwise very similar rk3288. And there
are even more timers in the system than the ones wrongly listed here.

Timer-Ids were unused both in clock-driver as well as devicetree
till now, so fixing them won't break anything.
