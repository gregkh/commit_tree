Revert "printk: fix double printing with earlycon"

This reverts commit cf39bf58afdaabc0b86f141630fb3fd18190294e.

The commit regression to users that define both console=ttyS1
and console=ttyS0 on the command line, see
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20170509082915.GA13236@bistromath.localdomain

The kernel log messages always appeared only on one serial port. It is
even documented in Documentation/admin-guide/serial-console.rst:

"Note that you can only define one console per device type (serial,
video)."

The above mentioned commit changed the order in which the command line
parameters are searched. As a result, the kernel log messages go to
the last mentioned ttyS* instead of the first one.

We long thought that using two console=ttyS* on the command line
did not make sense. But then we realized that console= parameters
were handled also by systemd, see
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/serial-console.html

"By default systemd will instantiate one serial-getty@.service on
the main kernel console, if it is not a virtual terminal."

where

"[4] If multiple kernel consoles are used simultaneously, the main
console is the one listed first in /sys/class/tty/console/active,
which is the last one listed on the kernel command line."

This puts the original report into another light. The system is running
in qemu. The first serial port is used to store the messages into a file.
The second one is used to login to the system via a socket. It depends
on systemd and the historic kernel behavior.

By other words, systemd causes that it makes sense to define both
console=ttyS1 console=ttyS0 on the command line. The kernel fix
caused regression related to userspace (systemd) and need to be
reverted.

In addition, it went out that the fix helped only partially.
The messages still were duplicated when the boot console was
removed early by late_initcall(printk_late_init). Then the entire
log was replayed when the same console was registered as a normal one.
