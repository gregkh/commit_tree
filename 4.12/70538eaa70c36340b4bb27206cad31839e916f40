powerpc/mm: Fix missing _PAGE_NON_IDEMPOTENT in pgtable dump

On Book3s we have two PTE flags used to mark cache-inhibited mappings:
_PAGE_TOLERANT and _PAGE_NON_IDEMPOTENT. Currently the kernel page table dumper
only looks at the generic _PAGE_NO_CACHE which is defined to be _PAGE_TOLERANT.
This patch modifies the dumper so both flags are shown in the dump.
