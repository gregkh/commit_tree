Remove compat_sys_getdents64()

Unlike normal compat syscall variants, it is needed only for
biarch architectures that have different alignement requirements for
u64 in 32bit and 64bit ABI *and* have __put_user() that won't handle
a store of 64bit value at 32bit-aligned address.  We used to have one
such (ia64), but its biarch support has been gone since 2010 (after
being broken in 2008, which went unnoticed since nobody had been using
it).

It had escaped removal at the same time only because back in 2004
a patch that switched several syscalls on amd64 from private wrappers to
generic compat ones had switched to use of compat_sys_getdents64(), which
hadn't needed (or used) a compat wrapper on amd64.

Let's bury it - it's at least 7 years overdue.
