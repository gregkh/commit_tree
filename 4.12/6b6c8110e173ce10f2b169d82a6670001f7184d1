md/raid1, raid10: move rXbio accounting closer to allocation.

When raid1 or raid10 find they will need to allocate a new
r1bio/r10bio, in order to work around a known bad block, they
account for the allocation well before the allocation is
made.  This separation makes the correctness less obvious
and requires comments.

The accounting needs to be a little before: before the first
rXbio is submitted, but that is all.

So move the accounting down to where it makes more sense.
