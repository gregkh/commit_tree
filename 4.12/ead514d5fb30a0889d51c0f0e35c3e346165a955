powerpc/kprobes: Add support for KPROBES_ON_FTRACE

Allow kprobes to be placed on ftrace _mcount() call sites. This optimization
avoids the use of a trap, by riding on ftrace infrastructure.

This depends on HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS which depends on MPROFILE_KERNEL,
which is only currently enabled on powerpc64le with newer toolchains.

Based on the x86 code by Masami.
