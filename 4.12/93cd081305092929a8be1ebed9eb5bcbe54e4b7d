mlxsw: spectrum: Teach mlxsw_sp_port_vlan_set to accept any vlan range

So far, mlxsw_sp_port_vlan_set range is limited by
MLXSW_REG_SPVM_REC_MAX_COUNT. In spectrum_switchdev code this is
wrapped up by a helper function which actually does multiple calls
to FW for bigger ranges. Move the code into mlxsw_sp_port_vlan_set
and use it always. That allows caller not to care about the range.
