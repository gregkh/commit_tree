net: use kvmalloc with __GFP_REPEAT rather than open coded variant

fq_alloc_node, alloc_netdev_mqs and netif_alloc* open code kmalloc with
vmalloc fallback.  Use the kvmalloc variant instead.  Keep the
__GFP_REPEAT flag based on explanation from Eric:

 "At the time, tests on the hardware I had in my labs showed that
  vmalloc() could deliver pages spread all over the memory and that was
  a small penalty (once memory is fragmented enough, not at boot time)"

The way how the code is constructed means, however, that we prefer to go
and hit the OOM killer before we fall back to the vmalloc for requests
<=32kB (with 4kB pages) in the current code.  This is rather disruptive
for something that can be achived with the fallback.  On the other hand
__GFP_REPEAT doesn't have any useful semantic for these requests.  So
the effect of this patch is that requests which fit into 32kB will fall
back to vmalloc easier now.
