cxgb4: avoid crash on PCI error recovery path

During PCI error recovery process, specifically on eeh_err_detected()
we might have a NULL netdev struct, hence a direct dereference will
lead to a kernel oops. This was observed with latest upstream kernel
(v4.12-rc2) on Chelsio adapter T422-CR in PowerPC machines.

This patch checks for NULL pointer and avoids the crash, both in
eeh_err_detected() and eeh_resume(). Also, we avoid to trigger
a fatal error or to try disabling interrupts on FW during PCI
error recovery, because: (a) driver might not be able to accurately
access PCI regions in this case, and (b) trigger a fatal error
_during_ the recovery steps is a mistake that could prevent the
recovery path to complete successfully.
