cpufreq: intel_pstate: Do not walk policy->cpus

intel_pstate_hwp_set() is the only function walking policy->cpus
in intel_pstate.  The rest of the code simply assumes one CPU per
policy, including the initialization code.

Therefore it doesn't make sense for intel_pstate_hwp_set() to
walk policy->cpus as it is guaranteed to have only one bit set
for policy->cpu.

For this reason, rearrange intel_pstate_hwp_set() to take the CPU
number as the argument and drop the loop over policy->cpus from it.
