rcu: Open-code the rcu_cblist_empty() function

Because the rcu_cblist_empty() just samples the ->head pointer, and
because the rcu_cblist structure is quite straightforward, it makes
sense to open-code rcu_cblist_empty(p) as !p->head, cutting out a
level of indirection.  This commit makes this change.
