printk: rename selected_console -> preferred_console

The variable selected_console is set in __add_preferred_console()
to point to the last console parameter that was added to the
console_cmdline array.

Rename it to preferred_console so that the name reflects the usage.

Petr Mladek:
"[..] the selected_console/preferred_console
value is used to keep the console first in the console_drivers list.
IMHO, the main effect is that each line will first appear on this
console, see call_console_drivers(). But the message will still
appear also on all other enabled consoles. From this point,
the name "preferred" sounds better to me. More consoles
are selected (enabled) and only one is preferred (first)."
