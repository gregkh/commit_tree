livepatch: Reduce the time of finding module symbols

It's reported that the time of insmoding a klp.ko for one of our
out-tree modules is too long.

~ time sudo insmod klp.ko
real	0m23.799s
user	0m0.036s
sys	0m21.256s

Then we found the reason: our out-tree module used a lot of static local
variables, so klp.ko has a lot of relocation records which reference the
module. Then for each such entry klp_find_object_symbol() is called to
resolve it, but this function uses the interface kallsyms_on_each_symbol()
even for finding module symbols, so will waste a lot of time on walking
through vmlinux kallsyms table many times.

This patch changes it to use module_kallsyms_on_each_symbol() for modules
symbols. After we apply this patch, the sys time reduced dramatically.

~ time sudo insmod klp.ko
real	0m1.007s
user	0m0.032s
sys	0m0.924s
