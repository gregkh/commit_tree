drm/i915: Support explicit fencing for execbuf

Now that the user can opt-out of implicit fencing, we need to give them
back control over the fencing. We employ sync_file to wrap our
drm_i915_gem_request and provide an fd that userspace can merge with
other sync_file fds and pass back to the kernel to wait upon before
future execution.
