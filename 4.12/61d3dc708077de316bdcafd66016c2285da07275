drm/i915: Split breadcrumbs spinlock into two

As we now take the breadcrumbs spinlock within the interrupt handler, we
wish to minimise its hold time. During the interrupt we do not care
about the state of the full rbtree, only that of the first element, so
we can guard that with a separate lock.

v2: Rename first_wait to irq_wait to make it clearer that it is guarded
by irq_lock.
