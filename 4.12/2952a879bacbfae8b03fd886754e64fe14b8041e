nvme-fc: stop queues on error detection

Per the recommendation by Sagi on:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-nvme/2017-April/009261.html

Rather than waiting for reset work thread to stop queues and abort the ios,
immediately stop the queues on error detection. Reset thread will restop
the queues (as it's called on other paths), but it does not appear to have
a side effect.
