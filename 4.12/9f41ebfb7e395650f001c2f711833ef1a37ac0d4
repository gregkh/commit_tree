usb: musb: don't mark of_dev_auxdata as initdata

The probe function is not __init since it can be called for deferred
probing or when unbinding/rebinding the device, and therefore it must
not reference objects in __initdata, as pointed out by this link
time warning:

WARNING: drivers/usb/musb/da8xx.o(.text+0x9d4): Section mismatch in reference from the function da8xx_probe() to the (unknown reference) .init.data:(unknown)

This removes the annotation.
