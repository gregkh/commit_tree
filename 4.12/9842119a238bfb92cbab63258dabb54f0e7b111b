arm64: Add CNTFRQ_EL0 trap handler

We now trap accesses to CNTVCT_EL0 when the counter is broken
enough to require the kernel to mediate the access. But it
turns out that some existing userspace (such as OpenMPI) do
probe for the counter frequency, leading to an UNDEF exception
as CNTVCT_EL0 and CNTFRQ_EL0 share the same control bit.

The fix is to handle the exception the same way we do for CNTVCT_EL0.
