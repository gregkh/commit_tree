blk-mq: Register <dev>/queue/mq after having registered <dev>/queue

A later patch in this series will modify blk_mq_debugfs_register()
such that it uses q->kobj.parent to determine the name of a
request queue. Hence make sure that that pointer is initialized
before blk_mq_debugfs_register() is called. To avoid lock inversion,
protect sysfs / debugfs registration with the queue sysfs_lock
instead of the global mutex all_q_mutex.
