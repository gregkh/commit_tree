mtd: nand: fsmc: fix NAND width handling

In commit eea628199d5b ("mtd: Add device-tree support to fsmc_nand"),
Device Tree support was added to the fmsc_nand driver. However, this
code has a bug in how it handles the bank-width DT property to set the
bus width.

Indeed, in the function fsmc_nand_probe_config_dt() that parses the
Device Tree, it sets pdata->width to either 8 or 16 depending on the
value of the bank-width DT property.

Then, the ->probe() function will test if pdata->width is equal to
FSMC_NAND_BW16 (which is 2) to set NAND_BUSWIDTH_16 in
nand->options. Therefore, with the DT probing, this condition will never
match.

This commit fixes that by removing the "width" field from
fsmc_nand_platform_data and instead have the fsmc_nand_probe_config_dt()
function directly set the appropriate nand->options value.

It is worth mentioning that if this commit gets backported to older
kernels, prior to the drop of non-DT probing, then non-DT probing will
be broken because nand->options will no longer be set to
NAND_BUSWIDTH_16.
