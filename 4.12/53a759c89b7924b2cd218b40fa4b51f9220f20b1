smsc95xx: Add comments to the registers definition

This chip is used by a lot of embedded devices and also by the Raspberry
Pi 1, 2 & 3 which were created to promote the study of computer
sciences. Students wanting to learn kernel / network device driver
programming through those devices can only rely on the Linux kernel
driver source to make their own.

This commit adds a lot of comments to the registers definition to expand
the register names.
