staging: lustre: llite: remove extraneous export parameter

The ll_close_inode_openhandle() and ll_md_close() functions passed an
extra "obd_export *md_exp" parameter, but it turns out that all of the
callers already pass inode->i_sb->s_fs_info->lsi_llsbi->ll_md_exp in
one form or another, so it can just be extracted from "inode" directly
as needed.
