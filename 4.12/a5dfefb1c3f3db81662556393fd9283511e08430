crypto: drbg - wait for crypto op not signal safe

drbg_kcapi_sym_ctr() was using wait_for_completion_interruptible() to
wait for completion of async crypto op but if a signal occurs it
may return before DMA ops of HW crypto provider finish, thus
corrupting the output buffer.

Resolve this by using wait_for_completion() instead.
