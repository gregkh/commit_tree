fsnotify: Lock object list with connector lock

So far list of marks attached to an object (inode / vfsmount) was
protected by i_lock or mnt_root->d_lock. This dictates that the list
must be empty before the object can be destroyed although the list is
now anchored in the fsnotify_mark_connector structure. Protect the list
by a spinlock in the fsnotify_mark_connector structure to decouple
lifetime of a list of marks from a lifetime of the object. This also
simplifies the code quite a bit since we don't have to differentiate
between inode and vfsmount lists in quite a few places anymore.
