blk-throttle: fix unused variable warning with BLK_DEV_THROTTLING_LOW=n

We trigger this warning:

block/blk-throttle.c: In function ‘blk_throtl_bio’:
block/blk-throttle.c:2042:6: warning: variable ‘ret’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  int ret;
      ^~~

since we only assign 'ret' if BLK_DEV_THROTTLING_LOW is off, we never
check it.
