usb: dwc3: pci: Switch to devm_acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios()

Switch to use managed variant of acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios() to simplify
error path and fix potentially wrong assignment if ->probe() fails.

While here, add a debug message in case assignment fails to allow user
see the cause of a potential issue.
