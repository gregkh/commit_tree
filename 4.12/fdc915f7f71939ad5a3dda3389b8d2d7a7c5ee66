tpm: expose spaces via a device link /dev/tpmrm<n>

Currently the tpm spaces are not exposed to userspace.  Make this
exposure via a separate device, which can now be opened multiple times
because each read/write transaction goes separately via the space.

Concurrency is protected by the chip->tpm_mutex for each read/write
transaction separately.  The TPM is cleared of all transient objects
by the time the mutex is dropped, so there should be no interference
between the kernel and userspace.
