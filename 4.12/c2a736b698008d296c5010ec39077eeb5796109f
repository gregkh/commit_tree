ARM: dts: Adjust moxart IRQ controller and flags

The moxart interrupt line flags were not respected in previous
driver: instead of assigning them per-consumer, a fixes mask
was set in the controller.

With the migration to a standard Faraday driver we need to
set up and handle the consumer flags correctly. Also remove
the Moxart-specific flags when switching to using real consumer
flags.

Extend the register window to 0x100 bytes as we may have a few
more registers in there and it doesn't hurt.
