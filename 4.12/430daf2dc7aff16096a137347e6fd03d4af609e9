perf stat: Collapse identically named events

The uncore PMU has a lot of duplicated PMUs for different subsystems.
When expanding an uncore alias we usually end up with a large
number of identically named aliases, which makes perf stat
output difficult to read.

Automatically sum them up in perf stat, unless --no-merge is specified.

This can be default because only the uncores generally have duplicated
aliases. Other PMUs have unique names.

Before:

  % perf stat --no-merge -a -e unc_c_llc_lookup.any sleep 1

v2: Split collect_aliases. Rename alias flag.
v3: Make sure unsupported/not counted is always printed.
v4: Factor out callback change into separate patch.
v5: Move check for bad results here
    Move merged check into collect_data
