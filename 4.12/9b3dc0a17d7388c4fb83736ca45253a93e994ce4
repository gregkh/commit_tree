l2tp: cast l2tp traffic counter to unsigned

This fixes a counter problem on 32bit systems:
When the rx_bytes counter reached 2 GiB, it jumpd to (2^64 Bytes - 2GiB) Bytes.

rtnl_link_stats64 has __u64 type and atomic_long_read returns
atomic_long_t which is signed. Due to the conversation
we get an incorrect value on 32bit systems if the MSB of
the atomic_long_t value is set.
