[media] s5p-mfc: Fix race between interrupt routine and device functions

Interrupt routine must wake process waiting for given interrupt AFTER
updating driver's internal structures and contexts. Doing it in-between
is a serious bug. This patch moves all calls to the wake() function to
the end of the interrupt processing block to avoid potential and real
races, especially on multi-core platforms. This also fixes following issue
reported from clock core (clocks were disabled in interrupt after being
unprepared from the other place in the driver, the stack trace however
points to the different place than s5p_mfc driver because of the race):
