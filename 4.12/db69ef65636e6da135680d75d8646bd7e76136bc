x86/intel_rdt/mba: Add info directory files for Memory Bandwidth Allocation

The files in the info directory for MBA are as follows:

 num_closids
 	The maximum number of CLOSids available for MBA

 min_bandwidth
 	The minimum memory bandwidth percentage value

 bandwidth_gran
 	The granularity of the bandwidth control in percent for the
	particular CPU SKU. Intermediate values entered are rounded off
	to the previous control step available. Available bandwidth
	control steps are minimum_bandwidth + N * bandwidth_gran.

 delay_linear
 	When set, the OS writes a linear percentage based value to the
	control MSRs ranging from minimum_bandwidth to 100 percent.

	This value is informational and has no influence on the values
	written to the schemata files. The values written to the
	schemata are always bandwidth percentage that is requested.
