drm/vc4: Extend and edit documentation for output from the RST

I had written most of my comments as if I was describing the
individual code files the way I used to for doxygen, while for RST we
want to describe things in a more chapter/section way where there's no
obvious relation to .c files.

Additionally, several of the files had stub descriptions that I've
taken this opportunity to extend.
