vTPM: Fix missing NULL check

The current code passes the address of tpm_chip as the argument to
dev_get_drvdata() without prior NULL check in
tpm_ibmvtpm_get_desired_dma.  This resulted an oops during kernel
boot when vTPM is enabled in Power partition configured in active
memory sharing mode.

The vio_driver's get_desired_dma() is called before the probe(), which
for vtpm is tpm_ibmvtpm_probe, and it's this latter function that
initializes the driver and set data.  Attempting to get data before
the probe() caused the problem.

This patch adds a NULL check to the tpm_ibmvtpm_get_desired_dma.
