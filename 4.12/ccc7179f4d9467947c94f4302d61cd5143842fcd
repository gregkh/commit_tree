platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Add IdeaPad V310-15ISK to no_hw_rfkill

Like other Lenovo models the IdeaPad V310-15ISK does not have an hw
rfkill switch. This results in hard-blocked radios after boot, resulting
in always blocked radios rendering them unusable.

Add the IdeaPad V310-15ISK to the no_hw_rfkill DMI list and allows using
the built-in radios.
