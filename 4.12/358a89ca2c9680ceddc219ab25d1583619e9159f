input: utilize new cdev_device_add helper function

Replace the open coded registration of the cdev and dev with the
new device_add_cdev() helper in evdev, joydev and mousedev. The helper
replaces a common pattern by taking the proper reference against the
parent device and adding both the cdev and the device.
