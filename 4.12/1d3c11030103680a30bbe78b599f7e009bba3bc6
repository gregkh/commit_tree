drm/nouveau: Don't register Thunderbolt eGPU with vga_switcheroo

An external Thunderbolt GPU can neither drive the laptop's panel nor be
powered off by the platform, so there's no point in registering it with
vga_switcheroo.  In fact, when the external GPU is runtime suspended,
vga_switcheroo will cut power to the internal discrete GPU, resulting in
a lockup.
