IB/ipoib: Fix memory leak in create child syscall

The flow of creating a new child goes through ipoib_vlan_add
which allocates a new interface and checks the rtnl_lock.

If the lock is taken, restart_syscall will be called to restart
the system call again. In this case we are not releasing the
already allocated interface, causing a leak.
