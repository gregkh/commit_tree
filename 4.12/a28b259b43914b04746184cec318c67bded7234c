scsi: hisi_sas: add missing break in switch statement

It appears that a break in the TRANS_TX_OPEN_CNX_ERR_NO_DESTINATION case
got accidentally removed in an earlier commit, as it stands, the
ts->stat and ts->open_rej_reason are being updated twice for this case
which looks incorrect.  Fix this by adding in the missing break
statement.
