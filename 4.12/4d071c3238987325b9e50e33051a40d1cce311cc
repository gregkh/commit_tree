PCI/PM: Add needs_resume flag to avoid suspend complete optimization

Some drivers - like i915 - may not support the system suspend direct
complete optimization due to differences in their runtime and system
suspend sequence.  Add a flag that when set resumes the device before
calling the driver's system suspend handlers which effectively disables
the optimization.

Needed by a future patch fixing suspend/resume on i915.
