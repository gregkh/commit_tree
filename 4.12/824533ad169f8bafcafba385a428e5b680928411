KVM: MIPS/VZ: VZ hardware setup for Octeon III

Set up hardware virtualisation on Octeon III cores, configuring guest
interrupt routing and carving out half of the root TLB for guest use,
restoring it back again afterwards.

We need to be careful to inhibit TLB shutdown machine check exceptions
while invalidating guest TLB entries, since TLB invalidation is not
available so guest entries must be invalidated by setting them to unique
unmapped addresses, which could conflict with mappings set by the guest
or root if recently repartitioned.
