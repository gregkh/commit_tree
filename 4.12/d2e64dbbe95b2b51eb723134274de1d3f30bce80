net: Only define skb_mark_napi_id in one spot instead of two

Instead of defining two versions of skb_mark_napi_id I think it is more
readable to just match the format of the sk_mark_napi_id functions and just
wrap the contents of the function instead of defining two versions of the
function.  This way we can save a few lines of code since we only need 2 of
the ifdef/endif but needed 5 for the extra function declaration.
