vt: make mouse selection of non-ASCII consistent

For some reason a handful of ISO-8859-1 symbols are excluded from "word
chars" while the vast majority of Unicode is hard-coded as included, even
when inappropriate (we really would want to _not_ select line-drawing/etc).
Those symbols are: ¡¢£¤¥¦§¨©ª«¬®¯°±²³´µ¶·¸¹º»¼½¾¿×÷

Thus, let's not special-case any non-ASCII anymore.  Attempts to set these
via ioctl will be silently ignored.

As an extra bonus, we debloat the kernel by 128 bytes.
