of/acpi: Configure dma operations at probe time for platform/amba/pci bus devices

Configuring DMA ops at probe time will allow deferring device probe when
the IOMMU isn't available yet. The dma_configure for the device is
now called from the generic device_attach callback just before the
bus/driver probe is called. This way, configuring the DMA ops for the
device would be called at the same place for all bus_types, hence the
deferred probing mechanism should work for all buses as well.

pci_bus_add_devices    (platform/amba)(_device_create/driver_register)
       |                         |
pci_bus_add_device     (device_add/driver_register)
       |                         |
device_attach           device_initial_probe
       |                         |
__device_attach_driver    __device_attach_driver
       |
driver_probe_device
       |
really_probe
       |
dma_configure

Similarly on the device/driver_unregister path __device_release_driver is
called which inturn calls dma_deconfigure.

This patch changes the dma ops configuration to probe time for
both OF and ACPI based platform/amba/pci bus devices.
