serial: core: Re-use struct uart_port {name} field

Since we have port name stored in struct uart_port, we better to use
that one instead of open coding.

This will make it one place source for easier maintenance or
modifications.

While here, replace printk(KERN_INFO ) by pr_info(). It seems last printk()
call in serial_core.c.
