blk-mq-sched: provide hooks for initializing hardware queue data

Schedulers need to be informed when a hardware queue is added or removed
at runtime so they can allocate/free per-hardware queue data. So,
replace the blk_mq_sched_init_hctx_data() helper, which only makes sense
at init time, with .init_hctx() and .exit_hctx() hooks.
