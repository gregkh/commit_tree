staging: ks7010: simplify calls to memcpy()

Function uses overly complex calls to memcpy(). Code may be simplified
by the use of a local variable. Code sometimes uses explicit address
of initial array element and sometimes does not. Uniformity aids
readability. If array pointers are explicit it aids readability further.

Simplify calls to memcpy(). Add local pointer variable, define it to
the correct memory location. Use newly defined variable in calls to
memcpy(). Be uniform in use of explicit address of first element of
array (&foo[0]).
