powerpc: Fix distclean with Makefile.postlink

Makefile.postlink always includes include/config/auto.conf, however
this file is not present in a clean kernel tree, causing make to fail:

  $ git clone linuxppc.git
  $ cd linuxppc.git
  $ make distclean
  arch/powerpc/Makefile.postlink:10: include/config/auto.conf: No such file or directory
  make[1]: *** No rule to make target `include/config/auto.conf'.  Stop.
  make: *** [vmlinuxclean] Error 2

Equally running 'make distclean; make distclean' will trip the error case.

Change the inclusion such that file not being found does not trigger an error.
