staging: android: ion: Replace pr_err with dev_err

All devm functions has a device structure as the first argument which is
required by dev_{err,info,dbg} printing functions.
This patch converts pr_err to dev_err as dev_* is preferred after calls
to devm functions.

Done using coccinelle:

@r1 exists@
expression e,e1;
identifier f =~ "^devm_";
identifier g =~ "^pcim_";
identifier h =~ "^dmam_";
@@
e=\(f\|g\|h\)(e1,...);
<+...
(
- pr_info(
+ dev_info(e1,
   ...);
|
- pr_err(
+ dev_err(e1,
  ...);
|
- pr_debug(
+ dev_dbg(e1,
  ...);
)
...+>
