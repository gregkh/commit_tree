drm/blend: Use new atomic iterator macros.

There are new iterator macros that annotate whether the new or old
state should be used. This is better than using a state that depends on
whether it's called before or after swap. For clarity, also rename the
variables from $obj_state to (old,new)_$obj_state as well.
