powerpc/kprobes: Blacklist exception handlers

Introduce __head_end to mark end of the early fixed sections and use it to
blacklist all exception handlers from kprobes.

mpe: We do not need to do anything special for relocatable kernels, where the
exception vectors are split from the main kernel, as the split vectors are
already excluded by the check for kernel_text_address().
