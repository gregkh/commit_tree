x86/platform/uv/BAU: Cleanup bau_operations declaration and instances

Move the bau_operations declaration after bau struct declarations so the
bau structs can be referenced when adding new functions to
bau_operations. That way we avoid forward declarations of the bau
structs.

Likewise, move uv*_bau_ops structs down to avoid forward declarations of
new functions defined in the same file. Declare these structs __initconst
since they are only used during initialization. Similarly, declare the
bau_operations ops instance __ro_after_init as it is read-only after
initialization.

This is a preparatory patch for adding wait_completion to bau_operations.
