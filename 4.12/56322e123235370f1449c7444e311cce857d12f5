ARM: dts: LogicPD Torpedo: Fix camera pin mux

Fix commit 05c4ffc3a266 ("ARM: dts: LogicPD Torpedo: Add MT9P031 Support")
In the previous commit, I indicated that the only testing was done by
showing the camera showed up when probing.  This patch fixes an incorrect
pin muxing on cam_d0, cam_d1 and cam_d2.
