perf/x86: Fix spurious NMI with PEBS Load Latency event

Spurious NMIs will be observed with the following command:

  while :; do
    perf record -bae "cpu/umask=0x01,event=0xcd,ldlat=0x80/pp"
                  -e "cpu/umask=0x03,event=0x0/"
                  -e "cpu/umask=0x02,event=0x0/"
                  -e cycles,branches,cache-misses
                  -e cache-references -- sleep 10
  done

The bug was introduced by commit:

  8077eca079a2 ("perf/x86/pebs: Add workaround for broken OVFL status on HSW+")

That commit clears the status bits for the counters used for PEBS
events, by masking the whole 64 bits pebs_enabled. However, only the
low 32 bits of both status and pebs_enabled are reserved for PEBS-able
counters.

For status bits 32-34 are fixed counter overflow bits. For
pebs_enabled bits 32-34 are for PEBS Load Latency.

In the test case, the PEBS Load Latency event and fixed counter event
could overflow at the same time. The fixed counter overflow bit will
be cleared by mistake. Once it is cleared, the fixed counter overflow
never be processed, which finally trigger spurious NMI.

Correct the PEBS enabled mask by ignoring the non-PEBS bits.
