net: thunderx: Optimize page recycling for XDP

Driver follows a method of taking one extra reference on the
page for recycling which is fine in usual packet path where
each 64KB page is segmented into multiple receive buffers.

But in XDP mode since there is just one receive buffer per
page taking extra page reference itself becomes big bottleneck
consuming ~50% of CPU cycles due to atomic operations.

This patch adds a internal ref count in pgcache for each
page and additional page references are taken in a batch
instead of just one at a time. Internal i.e 'pgcache->ref_count'
and page's i.e 'page->_refcount' counters are compared to check
page's recyclability.
