md: initialise ->writes_pending in personality modules.

The new per-cpu counter for writes_pending is initialised in
md_alloc(), which is not called by dm-raid.
So dm-raid fails when md_write_start() is called.

Move the initialization to the personality modules
that need it.  This way it is always initialised when needed,
but isn't unnecessarily initialized (requiring memory allocation)
when the personality doesn't use writes_pending.
