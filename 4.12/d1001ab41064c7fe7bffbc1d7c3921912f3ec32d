usb: xhci: clear EINT bit in status correctly

EINT(Event Interrupt) is a write-1-to-clear type of bit in xhci
status register. It should be cleared by writing a 1. Writing 0
to this bit has no effect.

Xhci driver tries to clear this bit by writing 0 to it. This is
not the right way to go. This patch corrects this by reading the
register first, then clearing all RO/RW1C/RsvZ bits and setting
the clearing bit, and writing back the new value at last.

Xhci spec requires that software that uses EINT shall clear it
prior to clearing any IP flags in section 5.4.2. This is the
reason why this patch is CC'ed stable as well.

[old way didn't cause any issues, skip stable, send to next -Mathias]
