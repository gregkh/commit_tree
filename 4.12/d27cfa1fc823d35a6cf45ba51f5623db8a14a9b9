arm64: mm: set the contiguous bit for kernel mappings where appropriate

This is the third attempt at enabling the use of contiguous hints for
kernel mappings. The most recent attempt 0bfc445dec9d was reverted after
it turned out that updating permission attributes on live contiguous ranges
may result in TLB conflicts. So this time, the contiguous hint is not set
for .rodata or for the linear alias of .text/.rodata, both of which are
mapped read-write initially, and remapped read-only at a later stage.
(Note that the latter region could also be unmapped and remapped again
with updated permission attributes, given that the region, while live, is
only mapped for the convenience of the hibernation code, but that also
means the TLB footprint is negligible anyway, so why bother)

This enables the following contiguous range sizes for the virtual mapping
of the kernel image, and for the linear mapping:

          granule size |  cont PTE  |  cont PMD  |
          -------------+------------+------------+
               4 KB    |    64 KB   |   32 MB    |
              16 KB    |     2 MB   |    1 GB*   |
              64 KB    |     2 MB   |   16 GB*   |

* Only when built for 3 or more levels of translation. This is due to the
  fact that a 2 level configuration only consists of PGDs and PTEs, and the
  added complexity of dealing with folded PMDs is not justified considering
  that 16 GB contiguous ranges are likely to be ignored by the hardware (and
  16k/2 levels is a niche configuration)
