nvmet: convert from kmap to nvmet_copy_from_sgl

This is safer as it doesn't rely on the data being stored in
a single page in an sgl.

It also aids our effort to start phasing out users of sg_page. See [1].

For this we kmalloc some memory, copy to it and free at the end. Note:
we can't allocate this memory on the stack as the kbuild test robot
reports some frame size overflows on i386.
