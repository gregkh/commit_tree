KVM: s390: introduce ais mode modify function

Provide an interface for userspace to modify AIS
(adapter-interruption-suppression) mode state, and add documentation
for the interface. Allowed target modes are ALL-Interruptions mode
and SINGLE-Interruption mode.

We introduce the 'simm' and 'nimm' fields in kvm_s390_float_interrupt
to store interruption modes for each ISC. Each bit in 'simm' and
'nimm' targets to one ISC, and collaboratively indicate three modes:
ALL-Interruptions, SINGLE-Interruption and NO-Interruptions. This
interface can initiate most transitions between the states; transition
from SINGLE-Interruption to NO-Interruptions via adapter interrupt
injection will be introduced in a following patch. The meaningful
combinations are as follows:

    interruption mode | simm bit | nimm bit
    ------------------|----------|----------
             ALL      |    0     |     0
           SINGLE     |    1     |     0
             NO       |    1     |     1

Besides, add tracepoint to track AIS mode transitions.
