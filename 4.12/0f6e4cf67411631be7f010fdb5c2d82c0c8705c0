net/mlx5e: Disable HW LRO when PCI is slower than link on striding RQ

We will activate the HW LRO only on servers with PCI BW > MAX LINK BW,
or when PCI BW > 16Gbps. On other cases we do not want LRO by default as
LRO sessions might get timeout and add redundant software overhead.

Tested:
	ethtool -k <ifs-name> | grep large-receive-offload
	On systems with and without the limitations.
