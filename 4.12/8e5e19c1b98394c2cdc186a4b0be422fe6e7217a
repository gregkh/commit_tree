selftests: ftrace: Add a way to reset triggers in the set_ftrace_filter file

Just writing into the set_ftrace_filter file does not reset triggers, even
though it can reset the function list. Triggers require writing the trigger
name with a "!" prepended. It's worse that it requires the number if the
trigger has a count associated to it.

Add a reset_ftrace_filter function to the ftrace self tests to allow for the
tests to have a generic way to clear them. It also resets any functions that
are listed in that file as well.
