powerpc/vfio_spapr_tce: Add reference counting to iommu_table

So far iommu_table obejcts were only used in virtual mode and had
a single owner. We are going to change this by implementing in-kernel
acceleration of DMA mapping requests. The proposed acceleration
will handle requests in real mode and KVM will keep references to tables.

This adds a kref to iommu_table and defines new helpers to update it.
This replaces iommu_free_table() with iommu_tce_table_put() and makes
iommu_free_table() static. iommu_tce_table_get() is not used in this patch
but it will be in the following patch.

Since this touches prototypes, this also removes @node_name parameter as
it has never been really useful on powernv and carrying it for
the pseries platform code to iommu_free_table() seems to be quite
useless as well.

This should cause no behavioral change.
