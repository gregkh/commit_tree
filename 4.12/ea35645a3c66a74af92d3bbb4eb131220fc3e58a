mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add support for signal voltage switch

eSDHC supports signal voltage switch from 3.3v to 1.8v by
eSDHC_PROCTL[VOLT_SEL] bit. This bit changes the value of output
signal SDHC_VS, and there must be a control circuit out of eSDHC
to change the signal voltage according to SDHC_VS output signal.
