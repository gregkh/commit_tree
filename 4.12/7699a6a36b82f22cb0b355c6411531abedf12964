acpi, nfit: kill ACPI_NFIT_DEBUG

Inevitably when one actually needs to debug a DSM issue it's on a
distribution kernel that has CONFIG_ACPI_NFIT_DEBUG=n. The config symbol
was only there to avoid the compile error due to the missing fallback for
print_hex_dump_debug in the CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG=n case. That was fixed
with commit cdf17449af1d "hexdump: do not print debug dumps for
!CONFIG_DEBUG", so the config symbol can just be dropped.
