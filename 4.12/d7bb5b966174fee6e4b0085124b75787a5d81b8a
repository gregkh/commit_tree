ARM: sunxi: h3/h5: switch apb0-related clocks to r_ccu

Now we have driver for the PRCM CCU, switch to use it instead of
old-style clock nodes for apb0-related clocks in sunxi-h3-h5.dtsi .

The mux 3 of R_CCU is still the internal oscillator, which is said to be
16MHz plus minus 30%, and get a measured value of 15MHz~16MHz on my two
H3 boards and one H5 board.
