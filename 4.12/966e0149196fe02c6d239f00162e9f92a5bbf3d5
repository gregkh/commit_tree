KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Implement early VGIC init functionality

Implement early initialization for both the distributor and the CPU
interfaces.  The basic idea is that even though the VGIC is not
functional or not requested from user space, the critical path of the
run loop can still call VGIC functions that just won't do anything,
without them having to check additional initialization flags to ensure
they don't look at uninitialized data structures.
