sock: reset sk_err when the error queue is empty

Prior to f5f99309fa74 (sock: do not set sk_err in
sock_dequeue_err_skb), sk_err was reset to the error of
the skb on the head of the error queue.

Applications, most notably ping, are relying on this
behavior to reset sk_err for ICMP packets.

Set sk_err to the ICMP error when there is an ICMP packet
at the head of the error queue.

Fixes: f5f99309fa74 (sock: do not set sk_err in sock_dequeue_err_skb)
