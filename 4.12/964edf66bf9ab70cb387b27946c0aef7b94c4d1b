ext4: clear lockdep subtype for quota files on quota off

Quota files have special ranking of i_data_sem lock. We inform lockdep
about it when turning on quotas however when turning quotas off, we
don't clear the lockdep subclass from i_data_sem lock and thus when the
inode gets later reused for a normal file or directory, lockdep gets
confused and complains about possible deadlocks. Fix the problem by
resetting lockdep subclass of i_data_sem on quota off.
