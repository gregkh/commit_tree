qed: Clean VF malicious indication when disabling IOV

When a VF is considered malicious, driver handling of the VF
FLR flow would clean said indication - but not if the FLR is
part of an sriov-disable flow.
That leads to further issues, as PF wouldn't re-enable the
previously malicious VF when sriov is re-enabled.

No reason for that - simply clean malicious indications in
the sriov-disable flow as well.
