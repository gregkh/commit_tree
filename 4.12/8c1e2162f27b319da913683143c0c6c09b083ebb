dm ioctl: restore __GFP_HIGH in copy_params()

Commit d224e9381897 ("drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c: use kvmalloc rather than
opencoded variant") left out the __GFP_HIGH flag when converting from
__vmalloc to kvmalloc.  This can cause the DM ioctl to fail in some low
memory situations where it wouldn't have failed earlier.  Add __GFP_HIGH
back to avoid any potential regression.
