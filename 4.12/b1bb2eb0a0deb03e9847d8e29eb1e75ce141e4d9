igb: Re-add support for build_skb in igb

This reverts commit f9d40f6a9921 ("igb: Revert support for build_skb in
igb") and adds a few changes to update it to work with the latest version
of igb. We are now able to revert the removal of this due to the fact
that with the recent changes to the page count and the use of
DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC we can make the pages writable so we should not be
invalidating the additional data added when we call build_skb.
