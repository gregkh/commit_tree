mailbox: Add driver for Broadcom FlexRM ring manager

Some of the Broadcom iProc SoCs have FlexRM ring manager
which provides a ring-based programming interface to various
offload engines (e.g. RAID, Crypto, etc).

This patch adds a common mailbox driver for Broadcom FlexRM
ring manager which can be shared by various offload engine
drivers (implemented as mailbox clients).
