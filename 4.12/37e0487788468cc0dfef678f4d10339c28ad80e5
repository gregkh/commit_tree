drm: bridge: analogix: Destroy connector & encoder when unbinding

Normally we do this in drm_mode_config_cleanup. But:
1/ analogix dp's connector is allocated in bind, and freed after unbind.
So we need to destroy it in unbind to avoid further access.
2/ the drm bridge is attached in bind, and detached in encoder cleanup.
So we need to destroy encoder in unbind.
