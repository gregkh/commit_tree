driver: (adm1275) set the m,b and R coefficients correctly for power

Seems like coefficient values for m, b and R under power have been
put in the wrong order. Rearranging them properly to get correct
values of coefficients for power.

For specs, please refer to table 7 (page 35) on
http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADM1075.pdf
