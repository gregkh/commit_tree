staging: ks7010: invert if statement conditionals

Checkpatch emits WARNING: Avoid multiple line dereference.

Function uses if statement blocks to guard the body of the
function. If we invert these conditionals and return, then the code
becomes more readable and subsequent code is indented less. The
checkpatch fix then follows trivially.

Invert conditionals, return from function if new conditional evaluates
to true. Reduce the level of indentation in subsequent code.
