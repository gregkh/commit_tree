ARM: KVM: Fix tracepoint generation after move to virt/kvm/arm/

Moving most of the shared code to virt/kvm/arm had for consequence
that KVM/ARM doesn't build anymore, because the code that used to
define the tracepoints is now somewhere else.

Fix this by defining CREATE_TRACE_POINTS in coproc.c, and clean-up
trace.h as well.
