Revert "ACPI / sleep: Ignore spurious SCI wakeups from suspend-to-idle"

Revert commit eed4d47efe95 (ACPI / sleep: Ignore spurious SCI wakeups
from suspend-to-idle) as it turned out to be premature and triggered
a number of different issues on various systems.

That includes, but is not limited to, premature suspend-to-RAM aborts
on Dell XPS 13 (9343) reported by Dominik.

The issue the commit in question attempted to address is real and
will need to be taken care of going forward, but evidently more work
is needed for this purpose.
