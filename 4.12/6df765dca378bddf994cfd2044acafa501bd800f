serial: imx: ensure UCR3 and UFCR are setup correctly

Commit e61c38d85b73 ("serial: imx: setup DCEDTE early and ensure DCD and
RI irqs to be off") has a flaw: While UCR3 and UFCR were modified using
read-modify-write before it switched to write register values
independent of the previous state. That's a good idea in principle (and
that's why I did it) but needs more care.

This patch reinstates read-modify-write for UFCR and for UCR3 ensures
that RXDMUXSEL and ADNIMP are set for post imx1.
