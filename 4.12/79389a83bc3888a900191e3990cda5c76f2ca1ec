ACPI / property: Add support for remote endpoints

DT has had concept of remote endpoints for some time already. It makes
possible to reference another firmware node through a property called
remote-endpoint. This is already used by some subsystems like v4l2 for
parsing hardware properties related to camera.

This patch adds ACPI support for remote endpoints utilizing _DSD
hierarchical data extensions.
