KEYS: encrypted: fix buffer overread in valid_master_desc()

With the 'encrypted' key type it was possible for userspace to provide a
data blob ending with a master key description shorter than expected,
e.g. 'keyctl add encrypted desc "new x" @s'.  When validating such a
master key description, validate_master_desc() could read beyond the end
of the buffer.  Fix this by using strncmp() instead of memcmp().  [Also
clean up the code to deduplicate some logic.]
