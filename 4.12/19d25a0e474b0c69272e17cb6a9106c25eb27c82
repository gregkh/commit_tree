KVM: x86: check against irqchip_mode in pic_in_kernel()

Let's avoid checking against kvm->arch.vpic. We have kvm->arch.irqchip_mode
for that now.

KVM_IRQCHIP_KERNEL implies a fully inititalized pic, while kvm->arch.vpic
might temporarily be set but invalidated again if e.g. kvm_ioapic_init()
fails when setting KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP. Although current users seem to be
fine, this avoids future bugs.
