ARM: DRA7: hwmod_data: Prevent wait_target_disable error for usb_otg_ss

It seems that if L3_INIT clkdomain is kept in HW_AUTO while usb_otg_ss
is in use then there are random chances that the usb_otg_ss module
will fail to completely idle. i.e. IDLEST = 0x2 instead of 0x3.

Preventing L3_INIT from HW_AUTO while usb_otg_ss module is in use
fixes this issue.

We don't know yet if usb_otg_ss instances 3 and 4 are affected by this
issue or not so don't add this flag for those instances.
