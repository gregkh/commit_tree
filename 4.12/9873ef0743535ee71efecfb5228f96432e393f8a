drm/msm: Make sure to detach the MMU during GPU cleanup

We should be detaching the MMU before destroying the address
space. To do this cleanly, the detach has to happen in
adreno_gpu_cleanup() because it needs access to structs
in adreno_gpu.c.  Plus it is better symmetry to have
the attach and detach at the same code level.
