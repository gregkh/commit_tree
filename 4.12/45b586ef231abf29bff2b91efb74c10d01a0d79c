tile/time: Set ->min_delta_ticks and ->max_delta_ticks

In preparation for making the clockevents core NTP correction aware,
all clockevent device drivers must set ->min_delta_ticks and
->max_delta_ticks rather than ->min_delta_ns and ->max_delta_ns: a
clockevent device's rate is going to change dynamically and thus, the
ratio of ns to ticks ceases to stay invariant.

Currently, the tile's timer clockevent device is initialized as follows:

  evt->max_delta_ns = clockevent_delta2ns(MAX_TICK, evt);

and

  .min_delta_ns = 1000,

The first one translates to a ->max_delta_ticks value of MAX_TICK.
For the latter, note that the clockevent core will superimpose a
minimum of 1us by itself -- setting ->min_delta_ticks to 1 is safe here.

Initialize ->min_delta_ticks and ->max_delta_ticks with these values.

This patch alone doesn't introduce any change in functionality as the
clockevents core still looks exclusively at the (untouched) ->min_delta_ns
and ->max_delta_ns. As soon as this has changed, a followup patch will
purge the initialization of ->min_delta_ns and ->max_delta_ns from this
driver.
