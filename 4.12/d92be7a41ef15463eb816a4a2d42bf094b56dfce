net: make struct net_device::min_header_len 8-bit

This field is never big enough to warrant 16-bitness.

8-bit accesses enjoy shorted encoding on i386/x86_64 than 16-bit
accesses:

	add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/2 up/down: 0/-10 (-10)
	function                                     old     new   delta
	loopback_setup                               169     164      -5
	ether_setup                                  148     143      -5
