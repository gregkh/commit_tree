rds: tcp: allow progress of rds_conn_shutdown if the rds_connection is marked ERROR by an intervening FIN

rds_conn_shutdown() runs in workq context, and marks the rds_connection
as DISCONNECTING before quiescing Tx/Rx paths. However, after all I/O
has quiesced, we may still find the rds_connection state to be
RDS_CONN_ERROR if an intervening FIN was processed in softirq context.

This is not a fatal error: rds_conn_shutdown() should continue the
shutdown, and there is no need to log noisy messages about this event.
