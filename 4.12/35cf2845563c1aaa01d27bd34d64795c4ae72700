vxlan: eliminate cached dst leak

After commit 0c1d70af924b ("net: use dst_cache for vxlan device"),
cached dst entries could be leaked when more than one remote was
present for a given vxlan_fdb entry, causing subsequent netns
operations to block indefinitely and "unregister_netdevice: waiting
for lo to become free." messages to appear in the kernel log.

Fix by properly releasing cached dst and freeing resources in this
case.
