drm/i915: Clear gt.active_requests before checking idle status

commit 8490ae207f1d ("drm/i915: Suppress busy status for engines if
wedged") moved the check for inflight requests to the
intel_engines_are_idle() check to protect the idle worker. However, the
request selftests were also checking the engine idle status and erroring
out if they did not become idle within a short period of time after the
final wait. In order to accommodate the new check, call retire requests
prior to the engine check so that we flush all the waits.
