ixgbe: Acquire PHY semaphore before device reset

A recent firmware change fixed an issue to acquire the PHY semaphore before
accessing PHY registers. This led to a case where  SW can issue a device
reset clearing the MDIO registers. This patch makes SW acquire the PHY
semaphore before issuing a device reset.
