clk: vc5: Add support for IDT VersaClock 5P49V5935

Update IDT VersaClock 5 driver to support 5P49V5935. This chip has
two clock inputs (internal XTAL or external CLKIN), four fractional
dividers (FODs) and five clock outputs (four universal clock outputs
and one reference clock output at OUT0_SELB_I2C).

Current driver supports up to 2 FODs and up to 3 clock outputs. This
patch sets max number of supported FODs to 4 and max number of supported
clock outputs to 5.
