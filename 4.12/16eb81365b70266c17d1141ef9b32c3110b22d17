Revert "perf tools: Fix include of linux/mman.h"

In https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/2/16 I reported a build error that I
believed was caused by wrong uapi includes. The synthom was fixed by
Arnaldo in:

 commit 2f7db5557994 ("perf tools: Fix include of linux/mman.h")

but I was wrong attributing the problem to the uapi include.

The root cause was that I was using ARCH=x86_64, hence using the wrong
uapi include path. This explains why no one else ran into this build
problem.
