ARM: dts: imx50: imx50-esdhc use imx53-esdhc

According to the reference manuals, both imx50/imx53 SOC seem to share
the same eSDHC controller, especially the section on "Multi-block Read"
mentioned in commit 361b8482026c ("mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: fix multiblock
reads on i.MX53") is identical for both SOC.
Hence, let imx50 use imx53-esdhc.
