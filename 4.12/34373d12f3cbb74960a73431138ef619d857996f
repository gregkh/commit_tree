cfg80211: Disallow moving out of operating DFS channel in non-ETSI

For non-ETSI regulatory domain, CAC result on DFS channel
may not be valid once moving out of that channel (as done
during remain-on-channel, scannning and off-channel tx).
Running CAC on an operating DFS channel after every off-channel
operation will only add complexity and disturb the current
link. Better do not allow any off-channel switch from a DFS
operating channel in non-ETSI domain.
