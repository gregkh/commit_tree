block: simple improvements for bio->flags

The comment for the 'flags' field of 'bio' mentions
"command" which is no longer stored there, and doesn't
mention the bvec pool number, which is.

BIO_RESET_BITS is set in such a way that it would need to be
updated if new bits were added, which is easy to miss.

BVEC_POOL_BITS is larger than needed.  The BVEC_POOL_IDX()
ranges from 0 to 6, so 3 bits are sufficient.

This patch make improvements in each of these areas.
