netfilter: nft_ct: add helper set support

this allows to assign connection tracking helpers to
connections via nft objref infrastructure.

The idea is to first specifiy a helper object:

 table ip filter {
    ct helper some-name {
      type "ftp"
      protocol tcp
      l3proto ip
    }
 }

and then assign it via

nft add ... ct helper set "some-name"

helper assignment works for new conntracks only as we cannot expand the
conntrack extension area once it has been committed to the main conntrack
table.

ipv4 and ipv6 protocols are tracked stored separately so
we can also handle families that observe both ipv4 and ipv6 traffic.
