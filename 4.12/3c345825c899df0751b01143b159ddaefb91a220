rcu: Expedited wakeups need to be fully ordered

Expedited grace periods use workqueue handlers that wake up the requesters,
but there is no lock mediating this wakeup.  Therefore, memory barriers
are required to ensure that the handler's memory references are seen by
all to occur before synchronize_*_expedited() returns to its caller.
