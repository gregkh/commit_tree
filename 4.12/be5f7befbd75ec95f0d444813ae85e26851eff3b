ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb-wetek-hub: add the ethernet PHY's reset GPIO

This resets the ethernet PHY during boot to get the PHY into a "clean"
state.
While here also specify the phy-handle of the ethmac node to make the
PHY configuration similar to the one we have on GXL devices. This will
allow us to specify OF-properties for the PHY itself.
