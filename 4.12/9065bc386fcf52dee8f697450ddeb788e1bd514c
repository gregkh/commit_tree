net: emac: fix and unify emac_mdio functions

emac_mdio_read_link() was not copying the requested phy settings
back into the emac driver's own phy api. This has caused a link
speed mismatch issue for the AR8035 as the emac driver kept
trying to connect with 10/100MBps on a 1GBit/s link.

This patch also unifies shared code between emac_setup_aneg()
and emac_mdio_setup_forced(). And furthermore it removes
a chunk of emac_mdio_init_phy(), that was copying the same
data into itself.
