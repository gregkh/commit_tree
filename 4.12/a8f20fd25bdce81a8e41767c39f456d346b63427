ALSA: hda - set input_path bitmap to zero after moving it to new place

Recently we met a problem, the codec has valid adcs and input pins,
and they can form valid input paths, but the driver does not build
valid controls for them like "Mic boost", "Capture Volume" and
"Capture Switch".

Through debugging, I found the driver needs to shrink the invalid
adcs and input paths for this machine, so it will move the whole
column bitmap value to the previous column, after moving it, the
driver forgets to set the original column bitmap value to zero, as a
result, the driver will invalidate the path whose index value is the
original colume bitmap value. After executing this function, all
valid input paths are invalidated by a mistake, there are no any
valid input paths, so the driver won't build controls for them.
