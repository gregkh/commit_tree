staging: most: usb: fix calculation of the extra_len

The final size of the buffer used for the streaming transfer consists of
the size for the user payload (buffer_size) and the size for the gaps
needed by the controller (extra_len).

The current implementation of the hdm_configure_channel() corrects the
buffer size down to the next appropriate for the hardware value, that is
the whole number of frames, but uses the old unaligned value to
calculate the extra_len.

Current patch fixes the described problem.
