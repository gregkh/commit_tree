ALSA: firewire-motu: remove invalid bitshift for register value

In protocol version 3, drivers can read current sampling clock status from
register 0x'ffff'f000'0b14. 8 bits of LSB of this register represents type
of signal as source of clock.

Current driver code includes invalid bitshift to handle the parameter. This
commit fixes the bug.
