qed: Always publish VF link from leading hwfn

The link information exists only on the leading hwfn,
but some of its derivatives [e.g., min/max rate] need to
be configured for each hwfn.
When re-basing the VF link view, use the leading hwfn
information as basis for all existing hwfns to allow
said configurations to stick.
