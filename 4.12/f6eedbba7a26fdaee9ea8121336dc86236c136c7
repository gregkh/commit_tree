powerpc/mm/hash: Increase VA range to 128TB

We update the hash linux page table layout such that we can support
512TB. But we limit the TASK_SIZE to 128TB. We can switch to 128TB by
default without conditional because that is the max virtual address
supported by other architectures. We will later add a mechanism to
on-demand increase the application's effective address range to 512TB.

Having the page table layout changed to accommodate 512TB makes testing
large memory configuration easier with less code changes to kernel
