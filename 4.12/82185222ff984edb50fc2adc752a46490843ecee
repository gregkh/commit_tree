powerpc/mm/slice: Move slice_mask struct definition to slice.c

This structure definition need not be in a header since this is used only by
slice.c file. So move it to slice.c. This also allow us to use SLICE_NUM_HIGH
instead of 64.

I also switch the low_slices type to u64 from u16. This doesn't have an impact
on size of struct due to padding added with u16 type. This helps in using
bitmap printing function for printing slice mask.
