ALSA: firewire-lib: cache maximum length of payload to reduce function calls

During packet streaming, maximum length of payload for isochronous packet
is invariable, therefore no need to recalculate. Current ALSA IEC 61883-1/6
engine calls a function to calculate it 8,000 or more times per second
for incoming packet processing.

This commit adds a member to have maximum length of payload into 'struct
amdtp_stream', to reduces the function calls. At first callback from
isochronous context, the length is calculated and stored for later
processing.
