drm/i915: Ensure the engine is idle before manually changing HWS

During reset_all_global_seqno() on seqno rollover, we have to update the
HWS. This causes all in flight requests to be completed, so first we
wait. However, we were only waiting for the requests themselves to be
completed and clearing out the waiter rbtrees - what I had missed was
the extra reference in execlists->port[]. Since commit fe9ae7a3bfdb
("drm/i915/execlists: Detect an out-of-order context switch") we can
detect when the request is retired before the context switch interrupt
is completed. The impact should be neglible outside of debugging.
