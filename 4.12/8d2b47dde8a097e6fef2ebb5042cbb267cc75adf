drm/i915: Enable atomic support by default on supported platforms.

i915 is pretty much feature complete. Support for atomic i915-specific
connector properties is still missing; those properties can (for now)
only be set through the legacy ioctl.

ILK style watermarks and gen9+ watermarks are handled atomically,
and nonblocking modesets work. FBC has also been made to work with
atomic.

gen4x- and vlv/chv watermarks still need to be fixed, so disable atomic
by default there for now.

Flip the switch!!
