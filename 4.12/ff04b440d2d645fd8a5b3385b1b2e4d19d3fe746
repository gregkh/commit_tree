x86/ftrace: Clean up ftrace_regs_caller

When ftrace_regs_caller was created, it was designed to preserve flags as
much as possible as it needed to act just like a breakpoint triggered on the
same location. But the design is over complicated as it treated all
operations as modifying flags. But push, mov and lea do not modify flags.
This means the code can become more simplified by allowing flags to be
stored further down.

Making ftrace_regs_caller simpler will also be useful in implementing fentry
logic.
