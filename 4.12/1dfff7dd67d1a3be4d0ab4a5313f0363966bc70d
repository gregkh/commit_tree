pstore: Pass record contents instead of copying

pstore_mkfile() shouldn't have to memcpy the record contents. It can use
the existing copy instead. This adjusts the allocation lifetime management
and renames the contents variable from "data" to "buf" to assist moving to
struct pstore_record in the future.
