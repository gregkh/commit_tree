ARM: DRA7: clockdomain: Change the CLKTRCTRL of CM_PCIE_CLKSTCTRL to SW_WKUP

The PCIe programming sequence in TRM suggests CLKSTCTRL of PCIe should be
set to SW_WKUP. There are no issues when CLKSTCTRL is set to HW_AUTO in RC
mode. However in EP mode, the host system is not able to access the
MEMSPACE and setting the CLKSTCTRL to SW_WKUP fixes it.
