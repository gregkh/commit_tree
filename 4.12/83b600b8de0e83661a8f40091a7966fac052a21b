mmc: sdhci: Control the delay between tuning commands

The delay between tuning commands for SD cards is not part of the
specification. A driver that needs it probably needs it for eMMC
too, whereas most drivers would probably like to set it to 0. Make
it a host member (host->tuning_delay) that defaults to the existing
behaviour. Drivers can set it to zero to eliminate the delay, or
set it to a positive value to always have a delay.
