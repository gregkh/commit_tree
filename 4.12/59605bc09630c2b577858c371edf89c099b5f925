i40e/i40evf: Add support for mapping pages with DMA attributes

This patch adds support for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC and
DMA_ATTR_WEAK_ORDERING. By enabling both of these for the Rx path we
are able to see performance improvements on architectures that implement
either one due to the fact that page mapping and unmapping only has to
sync what is actually being used instead of the entire buffer. In addition
by enabling the weak ordering attribute enables a performance improvement
for architectures that can associate a memory ordering with a DMA buffer
such as Sparc.
