drm/i915: Park the breadcrumbs signaler across a GPU reset

The signal threads may be running concurrently with the GPU reset. The
completion from the GPU run asynchronous with the reset and two threads
may see different snapshots of the state, and the signaler may mark a
request as complete as we try to reset it. We don't tolerate 2 different
views of the same state and complain if we try to mark a request as
failed if it is already complete. Disable the signal threads during
reset to prevent this conflict (even though the conflict implies that
the state we resetting to is invalid, we have already made our
decision!).
