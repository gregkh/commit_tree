initramfs: Always do fput() and load modules after rootfs populate

In OpenRISC we do not have a bootloader passed initrd, but the built in
initramfs does contain the /init and other binaries, including modules.
The previous commit 08865514805d2 ("initramfs: finish fput() before
accessing any binary from initramfs") made a change to only call fput()
if the bootloader initrd was available, this caused intermittent crashes
for OpenRISC.

This patch changes the fput() to happen unconditionally if any rootfs is
loaded. Also, I added some comments to make it a bit more clear why we
call unpack_to_rootfs() multiple times.
