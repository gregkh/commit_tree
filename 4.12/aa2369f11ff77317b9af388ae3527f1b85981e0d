mm/gup.c: fix access_ok() argument type

MIPS just got changed to only accept a pointer argument for access_ok(),
causing one warning in drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c.  I tried changing x86 the
same way and found the same warning in __get_user_pages_fast() and
nowhere else in the kernel during randconfig testing:

  mm/gup.c: In function '__get_user_pages_fast':
  mm/gup.c:1578:6: error: passing argument 1 of '__chk_range_not_ok' makes pointer from integer without a cast [-Werror=int-conversion]

It would probably be a good idea to enforce type-safety in general, so
let's change this file to not cause a warning if we do that.

I don't know why the warning did not appear on MIPS.
