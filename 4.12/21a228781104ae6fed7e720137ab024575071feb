ovl: handle rename when upper doesn't support xattr

On failure to set opaque/redirect xattr on rename, skip setting xattr and
return -EXDEV.

On failure to set opaque xattr when creating a new directory, -EIO is
returned instead of -EOPNOTSUPP.

Any failure to set those xattr will be recorded in super block and
then setting any xattr on upper won't be attempted again.
