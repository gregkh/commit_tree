power: bq24190_charger: Check the interrupt status on resume

Some SoCs like omap3 can configure GPIO irqs to use Linux generic
dedicated wakeirq support. If the dedicated wakeirq is configured,
the SoC will use a always-on interrupt controller to produce wake-up
events.

If bq24190 is configured for dedicated wakeirq, we need to check the
interrupt status on PM runtime resume. This is because the Linux
generic wakeirq will call pm_runtime_resume() on the device on a
wakeirq. And as the bq24190 interrupt is falling edge sensitive
and only active for 250 us, there will be no device interrupt seen
by the runtime SoC IRQ controller.

Note that this can cause spurious interrupts on omap3 devices with
bq24190 connected to gpio banks 2 - 5 as there's a glitch on those
pins waking from off mode as listed in "Advisory 1.45". Devices
with this issue should not configure the optional wakeirq interrupt
in the dts file.
