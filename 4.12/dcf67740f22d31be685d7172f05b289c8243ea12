netfilter: helper: add build-time asserts for helper data size

add a 32 byte scratch area in the helper struct instead of relying
on variable sized helpers plus compile-time asserts to let us know
if 32 bytes aren't enough anymore.

Not having variable sized helpers will later allow to add BUILD_BUG_ON
for the total size of conntrack extensions -- the helper extension is
the only one that doesn't have a fixed size.

The (useless!) NF_CT_HELPER_BUILD_BUG_ON(0); are added so that in case
someone adds a new helper and copy-pastes from one that doesn't store
private data at least some indication that this macro should be used
somehow is there...
