dax: introduce dax_operations

Track a set of dax_operations per dax_device that can be set at
alloc_dax() time. These operations will be used to stop the abuse of
block_device_operations for communicating dax capabilities to
filesystems. It will also be used to replace the "pmem api" and move
pmem-specific cache maintenance, and other dax-driver-specific
filesystem-dax operations, to dax device methods. In particular this
allows us to stop abusing __copy_user_nocache(), via memcpy_to_pmem(),
with a driver specific replacement.

This is a standalone introduction of the operations. Follow on patches
convert each dax-driver and teach fs/dax.c to use ->direct_access() from
dax_operations instead of block_device_operations.
