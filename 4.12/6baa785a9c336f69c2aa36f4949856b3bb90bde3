net: systemport: Clear status to reduce spurious interrupts

Do something similar to commit d5810ca3252a ("net: bcmgenet: clear
status to reduce spurious interrupts") and clear interrupts right before
servicing them. This reduces the number of interrupts by 10K
interrupts/sec for a TX TCP session 1Gbits/sec.
