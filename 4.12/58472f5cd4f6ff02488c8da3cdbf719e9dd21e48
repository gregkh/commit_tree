tpm: validate TPM 2.0 commands

Check for every TPM 2.0 command that the command code is supported and
the command buffer has at least the length that can contain the header
and the handle area.

For ContextSave and FlushContext we mark the body to be part of the
handle area. This gives validation for these commands at zero
cost, including the body of the command.

The more important reason for this is that we can virtualize these
commands in the same way as you would virtualize the handle area of a
command.
