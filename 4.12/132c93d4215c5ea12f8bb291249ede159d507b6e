drivers/misc: Aspeed LPC control fix compile error and warning

pgprot_dmachoerent() is not defined on every architecture. Having
COMPILE_TEST set for the driver causes it to be compiled on
architectures which do not have pgprot_dmachoerent():
    drivers/misc/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.c: In function 'aspeed_lpc_ctrl_mmap':
    drivers/misc/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.c:51:9: error: implicit declaration of
        function 'pgprot_dmacoherent' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
        prot = pgprot_dmacoherent(prot);

There are two possible solutions:
    1. Remove COMPILE_TEST to ensure the driver is only compiled on ARM
    2. Use pgprot_noncached() instead of pgprot_dmachoerent()

The first option results in less compile testing of the LPC control
driver which is undesirable.
The second option uses a function that is declared on all architectures
and therefore should always build. Currently there is no practical
difference between pgprot_noncached() and pgprot_dmachoerent() for the
aspeed chips that this driver is compatible with. The reason for
pgprot_dmachoerent() was that there may be chips made at some point in
the future that could include hardware that pgprot_dmachoerent() could
optimise for. As none of this hardware has even been announced there
isn't really a need for pgprot_dmachoerent().

Using pgprot_noncached() is completely correct and optimal for all
existing hardware on which the LPC control driver will run.

This commit also addresses that phys_addr_t should be printed using %pap
rather than %x:
