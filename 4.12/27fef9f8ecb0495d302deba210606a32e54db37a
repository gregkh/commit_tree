mfd: arizona: Fix typo using hard-coded register

A hardcoded register is accidentally used instead of the register
address passed into the function. Correct this and use the appropriate
variable. This would cause minor issues on wm5102, but all other
devices using this driver would have been unaffected.

Fixes: commit ef84f885e037 ("mfd: arizona: Refactor arizona_poll_reg")
