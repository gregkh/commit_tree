mtd: nand: allow drivers to request minimum alignment for passed buffer

In some cases, nand_do_{read,write}_ops is passed with unaligned
ops->datbuf.  Drivers using DMA will be unhappy about unaligned
buffer.

The new struct member, buf_align, represents the minimum alignment
the driver require for the buffer.  If the buffer passed from the
upper MTD layer does not have enough alignment, nand_do_*_ops will
use bufpoi.
