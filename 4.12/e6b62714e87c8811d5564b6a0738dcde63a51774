drm: Introduce drm_gem_object_{get,put}()

For consistency with other reference counting APIs in the kernel, add
drm_gem_object_get() and drm_gem_object_put(), as well as an unlocked
variant of the latter, to reference count GEM buffer objects.

Compatibility aliases are added to keep existing code working. To help
speed up the transition, all the instances of the old functions in the
DRM core are already replaced in this commit.

The existing semantic patch for the DRM subsystem-wide conversion is
extended to account for these new helpers.
