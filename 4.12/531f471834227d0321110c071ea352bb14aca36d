ALSA: firewire-lib/firewire-tascam: localize async midi port

In Linux kernel 4.4, firewire-lib got a feature called as 'async midi port'
for transmission of MIDI message via IEEE 1394 asynchronous communication,
however actual consumer of this feature is ALSA driver for TASCAM FireWire
series only. When adding this feature, I assumed that ALSA driver for
Digi00x might also be a consumer, actually it's not.

This commit moves the feature from firewire-lib to firewire-tascam module.
Two minor kernel APIs are removed.
