scsi: cxlflash: Fix power-of-two validations

Validation statements to enforce assumptions about specific defines are not
being evaluated by the compiler due to the fact that they reside in a routine
that is not used. To activate them, call the routine as part of module
initialization. As an additional, related cleanup, remove the now-defunct
CXLFLASH_NUM_CMDS.
