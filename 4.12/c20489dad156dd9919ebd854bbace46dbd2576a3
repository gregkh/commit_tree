ftrace: Assign iter->hash to filter or notrace hashes on seq read

Instead of testing if the hash to use is the filter_hash or the notrace_hash
at each iteration, do the test at open, and set the iter->hash to point to
the corresponding filter or notrace hash. Then use that directly instead of
testing which hash needs to be used each iteration.
