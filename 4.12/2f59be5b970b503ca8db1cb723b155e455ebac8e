powerpc/ftrace: Restore LR from pt_regs

Pass the real LR to the ftrace handler. This is needed for KPROBES_ON_FTRACE for
the pre handlers.

Also, with KPROBES_ON_FTRACE, the link register may be updated by the pre
handlers or by a registed kretprobe. Honor updated LR by restoring it from
pt_regs, rather than from the stack save area.

Live patch and function graph continue to work fine with this change.
