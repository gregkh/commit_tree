staging: iio: ad9832: replace mlock with driver private lock

The IIO subsystem is redefining iio_dev->mlock to be used by
the IIO core only for protecting device operating mode changes.
ie. Changes between INDIO_DIRECT_MODE, INDIO_BUFFER_* modes.

In this driver, mlock was being used to protect hardware state
changes.  Replace it with a lock in the devices global data.
