drm/i915: Initialize pm_intr_keep during intel_irq_init for GuC

Driver needs to ensure that it doesn't mask the PM interrupts, which are
unmasked/needed by GuC firmware. For that, Driver maintains a bitmask of
interrupts to be kept unmasked, pm_intr_keep.

pm_intr_keep was determined across GuC load. GuC gets loaded in different
scenarios and it is not going to change the pm_intr_keep so this patch
moves its setup to intel_irq_init.

This patch fixes incorrect RPS masking leading to UP interrupts triggered
even when at cur_freq=max and inversly for Down interrupts.
