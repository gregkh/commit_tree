staging/media: make atomisp vlv2_plat_clock explicitly non-modular

The Makefile / Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

clock/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_INTEL_ATOMISP)     += vlv2_plat_clock.o

atomisp/Kconfig:menuconfig INTEL_ATOMISP
atomisp/Kconfig:        bool "Enable support to Intel MIPI camera drivers"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init was already not in use by this driver, the init
ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
