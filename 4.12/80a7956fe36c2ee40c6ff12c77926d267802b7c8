srcu: Merge ->srcu_state into ->srcu_gp_seq

Updating ->srcu_state and ->srcu_gp_seq will lead to extremely complex
race conditions given multiple callback queues, so this commit takes
advantage of the two-bit state now available in rcu_seq counters to
store the state in the bottom two bits of ->srcu_gp_seq.
