net/mlx5e: Use dma_rmb rather than rmb in CQE fetch routine

Use dma_rmb in mlx5e_get_cqe rather than aggressive rmb (at least on
some architectures), this should help improve the performance on such
CPU archs where dma_rmb is optimized.

Performance improvement:
System: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz

Test case                   Baseline      Now      improvement
