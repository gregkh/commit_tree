IB/core: If the MGID/MLID pair is not on the list return an error

A list of MGID/MLID pairs is built when doing a multicast attach.  When
the multicast detach is called, the list is searched, and regardless of
the search outcome, the driver detach is called.

If an MGID/MLID pair is not on the list, driver detach should not be
called, and an error should be returned.  Calling the driver without
removing an MGID/MLID pair from the list can leave the core and driver
out of sync.
