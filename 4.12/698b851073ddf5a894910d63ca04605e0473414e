MIPS: kprobes: flush_insn_slot should flush only if probe initialised

When ftrace is used with kprobes, it is possible for a kprobe to contain
an invalid location (ie. only initialised to 0 and not to a specific
location in the code). Trying to perform a cache flush on such location
leads to a crash r4k_flush_icache_range().
