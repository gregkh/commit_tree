staging: iio: update locking method during frequency writes

The driver needs to insure atomicity during frequency
changes of bus and device. The iiodev->mlock as used
was not doing that. Replace it with the drivers existing
buffer lock and introduce an auxiliary spi_write() that does
not hold the lock.
