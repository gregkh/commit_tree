scsi: cxlflash: Support multiple hardware queues

Introduce multiple hardware queues to improve legacy I/O path performance.
Each hardware queue is comprised of a master context and associated I/O
resources. The hardware queues are initially implemented as a static array
embedded in the AFU. This will be transitioned to a dynamic allocation in a
later series to improve the memory footprint of the driver.
