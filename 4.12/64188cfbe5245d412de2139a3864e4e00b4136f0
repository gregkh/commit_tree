Revert "ALSA: usb-audio: purge needless variable length array"

This reverts commit 89b593c30e83 ("ALSA: usb-audio: purge needless
variable length array").  The patch turned out to cause a severe
regression, triggering an Oops at snd_usb_ctl_msg().  It was overseen
that snd_usb_ctl_msg() writes back the response to the given buffer,
while the patch changed it to a read-only const buffer.  (One should
always double-check when an extra pointer cast is present...)

As a simple fix, just revert the affected commit.  It was merely a
cleanup.  Although it brings VLA again, it's clearer as a fix.  We'll
address the VLA later in another patch.
