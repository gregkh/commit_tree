mmc: meson-gx: add support for descriptor chain mode

So far a bounce buffer is used to serialize the scatterlist(s).
This overhead can be avoided by switching to descriptor chain mode.
As result the performance is drastically improved. On a Odroid-C2 with
a 128 GB eMMC module raw reads reach 140 MB/s.

Prerequisite for descriptor chain mode is that all scatterlist buffers
are 8 byte aligned for 64-bit DMA. That's not always the case, at least
the brcmfmac SDIO WiFi driver is known to cause problems.

Therefore, for each request, check upfront whether all scatterlist
buffers are 8 byte aligned and fall back to bounce buffer mode if
that's not the case.
