tcp: remove tcp_tw_recycle

The tcp_tw_recycle was already broken for connections
behind NAT, since the per-destination timestamp is not
monotonically increasing for multiple machines behind
a single destination address.

After the randomization of TCP timestamp offsets
in commit 8a5bd45f6616 (tcp: randomize tcp timestamp offsets
for each connection), the tcp_tw_recycle is broken for all
types of connections for the same reason: the timestamps
received from a single machine is not monotonically increasing,
anymore.

Remove tcp_tw_recycle, since it is not functional. Also, remove
the PAWSPassive SNMP counter since it is only used for
tcp_tw_recycle, and simplify tcp_v4_route_req and tcp_v6_route_req
since the strict argument is only set when tcp_tw_recycle is
enabled.
