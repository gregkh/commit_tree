dm mpath: multipath_clone_and_map must not return -EIO

Since 412445ac ("dm: introduce a new DM_MAPIO_KILL return value"), the
clone_and_map_rq methods must not return errno values, so fix it up
to properly return DM_MAPIO_KILL, instead of the -EIO value that snuck
in due to a conflict between two patches.
