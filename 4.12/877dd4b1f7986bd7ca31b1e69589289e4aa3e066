ARM: configs: add a gemini defconfig

It makes sense to have a stripped-down defconfig for just Gemini, as
it is a pretty small platform used in NAS etc, and will use appended
device tree. It is also quick to compile and test. Hopefully this
defconfig can be a good base for distributions such as OpenWRT.

I plan to add in the config options needed for the different
variants of Gemini as we go along.
