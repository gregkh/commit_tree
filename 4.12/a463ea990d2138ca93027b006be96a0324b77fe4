[media] ov2640: make GPIOLIB an optional dependency

As warned by kbuild test robot:
	warning: (VIDEO_EM28XX_V4L2) selects VIDEO_OV2640 which has unmet direct dependencies (MEDIA_SUPPORT && VIDEO_V4L2 && I2C && GPIOLIB && MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT)

The em28xx driver can use ov2640, but it doesn't depend
(or use) the GPIOLIB in order to power off/on the sensor.

So, as we want to allow both usages with and without
GPIOLIB, make its dependency optional.
