drm/rockchip: dw-mipi-dsi: properly configure PHY timing

These values are specified as constant time periods but the PHY
configuration is in terms of the current lane byte clock so using
constant values guarantees that the timings will be outside the
specification with some display configurations.

Derive the necessary configuration from the byte clock in order to
ensure that the PHY configuration is correct.
