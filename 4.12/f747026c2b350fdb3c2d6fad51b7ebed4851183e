drm/i915: Only run execlist context-switch handler after an interrupt

Mark when we run the execlist tasklet following the interrupt, so we
don't probe a potentially uninitialised register when submitting the
contexts multiple times before the hardware responds.

v2: Use a shared engine->irq_posted
v3: Always use locked bitops to be sure of atomicity wrt to other bits
in the mask.
