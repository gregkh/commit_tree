ALSA: hda - Avoid tricky macros

The macros _snd_hdac_chip_read() and *_write() expand to different
types (b,w,l) per their argument.  They were thought to be used only
internally for other snd_hdac_chip_*() macros, but in some situations
we need to call these directly, and they are way too ugly.

Instead of saving a few lines, we just write these macros explicitly
with the types, so that they can be used in a saner way.
