IB/hfi1: Use kcalloc() in hfi1_user_exp_rcv_init()

* A multiplication for the size determination of a memory allocation
  indicated that an array data structure should be processed.
  Thus reuse the corresponding function "kcalloc".

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* Replace the specification of a data type by a pointer dereference
  to make the corresponding size determination a bit safer according to
  the Linux coding style convention.
