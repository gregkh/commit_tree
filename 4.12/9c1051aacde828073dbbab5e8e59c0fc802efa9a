blk-mq: untangle debugfs and sysfs

Originally, I tied debugfs registration/unregistration together with
sysfs. There's no reason to do this, and it's getting in the way of
letting schedulers define their own debugfs attributes. Instead, tie the
debugfs registration to the lifetime of the structures themselves.

The saner lifetimes mean we can also get rid of the extra mq directory
and move everything one level up. I.e., nvme0n1/mq/hctx0/tags is now
just nvme0n1/hctx0/tags.
