KVM: arm/arm64: Register ITS iodev when setting base address

We have to register the ITS iodevice before running the VM, because in
migration scenarios, we may be restoring a live device that wishes to
inject MSIs before the VCPUs have started.

All we need to register the ITS io device is the base address of the
ITS, so we can simply register that when the base address of the ITS is
set.
