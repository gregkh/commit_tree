net: handle NAPI_GRO_FREE_STOLEN_HEAD case also in napi_frags_finish()

Recently I started seeing warnings about pages with refcount -1. The
problem was traced to packets being reused after their head was merged into
a GRO packet by skb_gro_receive(). While bisecting the issue pointed to
commit c21b48cc1bbf ("net: adjust skb->truesize in ___pskb_trim()") and
I have never seen it on a kernel with it reverted, I believe the real
problem appeared earlier when the option to merge head frag in GRO was
implemented.

Handling NAPI_GRO_FREE_STOLEN_HEAD state was only added to GRO_MERGED_FREE
branch of napi_skb_finish() so that if the driver uses napi_gro_frags()
and head is merged (which in my case happens after the skb_condense()
call added by the commit mentioned above), the skb is reused including the
head that has been merged. As a result, we release the page reference
twice and eventually end up with negative page refcount.

To fix the problem, handle NAPI_GRO_FREE_STOLEN_HEAD in napi_frags_finish()
the same way it's done in napi_skb_finish().
