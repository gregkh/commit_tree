qed: Don't close the OUT_EN during init

Before initializing the chip's engine, driver currently closes a set
of registers on the HW's ingress flow to prevent packets from slipping
in while they're not supposed to.

This configuration is insufficient, as there are some scenarios where
packets would still arrive even when said registers are set,
but the management firmware already closes other per-port registers
that do suffice, making this setting unnecessray.
