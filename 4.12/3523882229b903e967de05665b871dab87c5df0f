bnx2x: Don't post statistics to malicious VFs

Once firmware indicates that a given VF is malicious and until
that VF passes an FLR all bets are off - PF can't know anything
is happening to the VF [since VF can't communicate anything to its PF].
But PF is currently still periodically asking device to collect
statistics for the VF which might in turn fill logs by IOMMU blocking
memory access done by the VF's PCI function [in the case VF has unmapped
its buffers].
