net: Add sysctl to toggle early demux for tcp and udp

Certain system process significant unconnected UDP workload.
It would be preferrable to disable UDP early demux for those systems
and enable it for TCP only.

By disabling UDP demux, we see these slight gains on an ARM64 system-
782 -> 788Mbps unconnected single stream UDPv4
633 -> 654Mbps unconnected UDPv4 different sources

The performance impact can change based on CPU architecure and cache
sizes. There will not much difference seen if entire UDP hash table
is in cache.

Both sysctls are enabled by default to preserve existing behavior.

v1->v2: Change function pointer instead of adding conditional as
suggested by Stephen.

v2->v3: Read once in callers to avoid issues due to compiler
optimizations. Also update commit message with the tests.

v3->v4: Store and use read once result instead of querying pointer
again incorrectly.

v4->v5: Refactor to avoid errors due to compilation with IPV6={m,n}
