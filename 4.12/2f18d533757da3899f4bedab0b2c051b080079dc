powerpc/mm: Lower the max real address to 53 bits

Max value supported by hardware is 51 bits address. Radix page table define
a slot of 57 bits for future expansion. We restrict the value supported in
linux kernel 53 bits, so that we can use the bits between 57-53 for storing
hash linux page table bits. This is done in the next patch.

This will free up the software page table bits to be used for features
that are needed for both hash and radix. The current hash linux page table
format doesn't have any free software bits. Moving hash linux page table
specific bits to top of RPN field free up the software bits for other purpose.
