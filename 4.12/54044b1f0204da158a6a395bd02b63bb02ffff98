netfilter: conntrack: remove prealloc support

It was used by the nat extension, but since commit
7c9664351980 ("netfilter: move nat hlist_head to nf_conn") its only needed
for connections that use MASQUERADE target or a nat helper.

Also it seems a lot easier to preallocate a fixed size instead.

With default settings, conntrack first adds ecache extension (sysctl
defaults to 1), so we get 40(ct extension header) + 24 (ecache) == 64 byte
on x86_64 for initial allocation.

Followup patches can constify the extension structs and avoid
the initial zeroing of the entire extension area.
