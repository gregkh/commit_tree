i40e: Drop FCoE code from core driver files

Looking over the code for FCoE it looks like the Rx path has been broken at
least since the last major Rx refactor almost a year ago.  It seems like
FCoE isn't supported for any of the Fortville/Fortpark hardware so there
isn't much point in carrying the code around, especially if it is broken
and untested.
