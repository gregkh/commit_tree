arm64: mmu: apply strict permissions to .init.text and .init.data

To avoid having mappings that are writable and executable at the same
time, split the init region into a .init.text region that is mapped
read-only, and a .init.data region that is mapped non-executable.

This is possible now that the alternative patching occurs via the linear
mapping, and the linear alias of the init region is always mapped writable
(but never executable).

Since the alternatives descriptions themselves are read-only data, move
those into the .init.text region.
