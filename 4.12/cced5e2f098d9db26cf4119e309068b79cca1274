drm/i915: Take a reference whilst processing the signaler request

The plan in the near-future is to allow requests to be removed from the
signaler. We can no longer then rely on holding a reference to the
request for the duration it is in the signaling tree, and instead must
obtain a reference to the request for the current operation using RCU.
