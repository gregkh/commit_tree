USB: hub: fix SS max number of ports

Add define for the maximum number of ports on a SuperSpeed hub as per
USB 3.1 spec Table 10-5, and use it when verifying the retrieved hub
descriptor.

This specifically avoids benign attempts to update the DeviceRemovable
mask for non-existing ports (should we get that far).
