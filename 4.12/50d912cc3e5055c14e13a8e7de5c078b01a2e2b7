arm64: hyp-stub: Stop pointlessly clobbering lr

When entering the kernel hyp stub, we check whether or not we've
made it here through an HVC instruction, clobbering lr (aka x30)
in the process.

This is completely pointless, as HVC is the only way to get here
(all traps to EL2 are disabled, no interrupt override is applied).

So let's remove this bit of code whose only point is to corrupt
a valuable register.
