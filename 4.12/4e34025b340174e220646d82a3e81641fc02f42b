Input: ad7879 - return plain error code from ad7879_probe()

With the switch to devm, there is no need for ad7879_probe() to return the
touchscreen structure, we can use plain error code. This also fixes issue
introduced with devm concersion, where we returned 0 on success (which
worked OK since IS_ERR(0) would not trigger, but was not correct
regardless).
