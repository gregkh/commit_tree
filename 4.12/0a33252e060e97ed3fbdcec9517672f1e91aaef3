staging/lustre/lov: remove set_fs() call from lov_getstripe()

lov_getstripe() calls set_fs(KERNEL_DS) so that it can handle a struct
lov_user_md pointer from user- or kernel-space.  This changes the
behavior of copy_from_user() on SPARC and may result in a misaligned
access exception which in turn oopses the kernel.  In fact the
relevant argument to lov_getstripe() is never called with a
kernel-space pointer and so changing the address limits is unnecessary
and so we remove the calls to save, set, and restore the address
limits.
