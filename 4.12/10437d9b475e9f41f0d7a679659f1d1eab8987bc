drm: tegra: use vblank hooks in struct drm_crtc_funcs

The vblank hooks in struct drm_driver are deprecated and only meant for
legacy drivers.  For modern drivers with DRIVER_MODESET flag, the hooks
in struct drm_crtc_funcs should be used instead.

As the result, the wrapper functions tegra_drm_xxx get killed
completely, and tegra_dc_xxx are filled into struct drm_crtc_funcs as
vblank hooks directly.
