ipv4: restore rt->fi for reference counting

IPv4 dst could use fi->fib_metrics to store metrics but fib_info
itself is refcnt'ed, so without taking a refcnt fi and
fi->fib_metrics could be freed while dst metrics still points to
it. This triggers use-after-free as reported by Andrey twice.

This patch reverts commit 2860583fe840 ("ipv4: Kill rt->fi") to
restore this reference counting. It is a quick fix for -net and
-stable, for -net-next, as Eric suggested, we can consider doing
reference counting for metrics itself instead of relying on fib_info.

IPv6 is very different, it copies or steals the metrics from mx6_config
in fib6_commit_metrics() so probably doesn't need a refcnt.

Decnet has already done the refcnt'ing, see dn_fib_semantic_match().
