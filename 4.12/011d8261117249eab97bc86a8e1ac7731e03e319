RAS: Add a Corrected Errors Collector

Introduce a simple data structure for collecting correctable errors
along with accessors. More detailed description in the code itself.

The error decoding is done with the decoding chain now and
mce_first_notifier() gets to see the error first and the CEC decides
whether to log it and then the rest of the chain doesn't hear about it -
basically the main reason for the CE collector - or to continue running
the notifiers.

When the CEC hits the action threshold, it will try to soft-offine the
page containing the ECC and then the whole decoding chain gets to see
the error.
