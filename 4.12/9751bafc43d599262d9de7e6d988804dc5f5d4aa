drm/i915/glk: Program pipe gamma and degamma tables

The gamma tables in Geminilake were changed. There is no split-gamma
mode. Instead, there is a dedicated degamma table that is enabled
whenever pipe CSC is enabled.

The dedicated gamma table has 16 bit precision but doesn't support
separate channels. Since that doesn't match the per-channel format of
the degamma LUT property, for now only a linear table is loaded and the
property ignored.

v2: Remove empty line. (Ville)
    Reuse broadwell code. (Ville)

v3: Don't write PIPE_CSC_MODE. (Ville)
