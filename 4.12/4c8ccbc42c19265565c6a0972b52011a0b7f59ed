devicetree/bindings: display: Add bindings for LVDS panels

LVDS is a physical layer specification defined in ANSI/TIA/EIA-644-A.
Multiple incompatible data link layers have been used over time to
transmit image data to LVDS panels. This binding supports display panels
compatible with the JEIDA-59-1999, Open-LDI and VESA SWPG
specifications.
