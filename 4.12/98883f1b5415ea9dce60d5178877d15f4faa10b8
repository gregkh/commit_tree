ibmvscsis: Clear left-over abort_cmd pointers

With the addition of ibmvscsis->abort_cmd pointer within
commit 25e78531268e ("ibmvscsis: Do not send aborted task response"),
make sure to explicitly NULL these pointers when clearing
DELAY_SEND flag.

Do this for two cases, when getting the new new ibmvscsis
descriptor in ibmvscsis_get_free_cmd() and before posting
the response completion in ibmvscsis_send_messages().
