atomisp: remove aa kernel wrappers

The aa kernel is used but it consists of nothing more than a set of wrappers
for a memset and an assignment. Replace these at the calling points with the
memset and assignment.

Keep the structures for now - those should disappear as the next layer up
gets unwrapped.
