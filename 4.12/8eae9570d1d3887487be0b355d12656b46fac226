KVM: SVM: ignore type when setting segment registers

Commit 19bca6ab75d8 ("KVM: SVM: Fix cross vendor migration issue with
unusable bit") added checking type when setting unusable.
So unusable can be set if present is 0 OR type is 0.
According to the AMD processor manual, long mode ignores the type value
in segment descriptor. And type can be 0 if it is read-only data segment.
Therefore type value is not related to unusable flag.

This patch is based on linux-next v4.12.0-rc3.
