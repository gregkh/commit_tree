cpufreq: intel_pstate: Modify check in intel_pstate_update_status()

One of the checks in intel_pstate_update_status() implicitly relies
on the information that there are only two struct cpufreq_driver
objects available, but it is better to do it directly against the
value it really is about (to make the code easier to follow if
nothing else).
