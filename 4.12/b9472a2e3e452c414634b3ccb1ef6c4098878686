brcmfmac: Handle status == BRCMF_E_STATUS_ABORT in cfg80211_escan_handler

If a scan gets aborted BRCMF_SCAN_STATUS_BUSY gets cleared in
cfg->scan_status and when we receive an abort event from the firmware
the BRCMF_SCAN_STATUS_BUSY check in the cfg80211_escan_handler will
trigger resulting in multiple errors getting logged.

Check for a status of BRCMF_E_STATUS_ABORT and in this case simply
cleanly exit the cfg80211_escan_handler. This also avoids a
BRCMF_E_STATUS_ABORT event arriving after a new scan has been started
causing the new scan to complete prematurely without any data.
