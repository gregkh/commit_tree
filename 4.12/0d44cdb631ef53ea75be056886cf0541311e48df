KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Interpret MAPD Size field and check related errors

Up to now the MAPD's ITT size field has been ignored. It encodes
the number of eventid bit minus 1. It should be used to check
the eventid when a MAPTI command is issued on a device. Let's
store the number of eventid bits in the its_device and do the
check on MAPTI. Also make sure the ITT size field does
not exceed the GITS_TYPER IDBITS field.
