xfs: simplify validation of the unwritten extent bit

XFS only supports the unwritten extent bit in the data fork, and only if
the file system has a version 5 superblock or the unwritten extent
feature bit.

We currently have two routines that validate the invariant:
xfs_check_nostate_extents which return -EFSCORRUPTED when it's not met,
and xfs_validate_extent that triggers and assert in debug build.

Both of them iterate over all extents of an inode fork when called,
which isn't very efficient.

This patch instead adds a new helper that verifies the invariant one
extent at a time, and calls it from the places where we iterate over
all extents to converted them from or two the in-memory format.  The
callers then return -EFSCORRUPTED when reading invalid extents from
disk, or trigger an assert when writing them to disk.
