bonding: handle link transition from FAIL to UP correctly

When link transitions from LINK_FAIL to LINK_UP, the commit phase is
not called. This leads to an erroneous state causing slave-link state to
get stuck in "going down" state while its speed and duplex are perfectly
fine. This issue is a side-effect of splitting link-set into propose and
commit phases introduced by de77ecd4ef02 ("bonding: improve link-status
update in mii-monitoring")

This patch fixes these issues by calling commit phase whenever link
state change is proposed.
