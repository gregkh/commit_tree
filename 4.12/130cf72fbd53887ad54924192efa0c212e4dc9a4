staging: rtl8723bs: Fix some indenting problems and a potential data overrun

Smatch reports the following:

  CHECK   drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/core/rtw_wlan_util.c
drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/core/rtw_wlan_util.c:67 cckrates_included() warn: if statement not indented
drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/core/rtw_wlan_util.c:81 cckratesonly_included() warn: if statement not indented
drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/core/rtw_wlan_util.c:815 rtw_camid_alloc() warn: should '1 << (cam_id)' be a 64 bit type?

The first two are fixed with white-space changes. The third is fixed by
restricting cam_id to be less than 32.
