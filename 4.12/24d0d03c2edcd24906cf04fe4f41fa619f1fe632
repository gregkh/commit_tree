apparmorfs: replace CURRENT_TIME with current_time()

CURRENT_TIME macro is not y2038 safe on 32 bit systems.

The patch replaces all the uses of CURRENT_TIME by current_time().

This is also in preparation for the patch that transitions vfs
timestamps to use 64 bit time and hence make them y2038 safe.
current_time() is also planned to be transitioned to y2038 safe behavior
along with this change.

CURRENT_TIME macro will be deleted before merging the aforementioned
change.
