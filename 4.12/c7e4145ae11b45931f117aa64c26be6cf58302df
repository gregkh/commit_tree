blk-mq-debugfs: error on long write to queue "state" file

blk_queue_flags_store() currently truncates and returns a short write if
the operation being written is too long. This can give us weird results,
like here:

$ echo "run            bar"
echo: write error: invalid argument
$ dmesg
[ 1103.075435] blk_queue_flags_store: unsupported operation bar. Use either 'run' or 'start'

Instead, return an error if the user does this. While we're here, make
the argument names consistent with everywhere else in this file.
