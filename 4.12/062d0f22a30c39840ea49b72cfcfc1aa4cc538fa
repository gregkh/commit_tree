IB/ocrdma: fix out of bounds access to local buffer

In write to debugfs file 'resource_stats' the local buffer 'tmp_str' is
written at index 'count-1' where 'count' is the size of the write, so
potentially 0.

This patch filters odd values for the write size/position to avoid this
type of problem.
