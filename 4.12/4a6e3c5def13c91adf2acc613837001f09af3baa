net: ipv6: send unsolicited NA on admin up

ndisc_notify is the ipv6 equivalent to arp_notify. When arp_notify is
set to 1, gratuitous arp requests are sent when the device is brought up.
The same is expected when ndisc_notify is set to 1 (per ndisc_notify in
Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt). The NA is not sent on NETDEV_UP
event; add it.
