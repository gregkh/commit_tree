usb: host: ehci-platform: fix usb 1.1 device is not connected in system resume

This patch fixes an issue that a usb 1.1 device is not connected in
system resume and then the following message appeared if debug messages
are enabled:
	usb 2-1: Waited 2000ms for CONNECT

To resolve this issue, the EHCI controller must be resumed after its
companion controllers. So, this patch adds such code on the driver.
