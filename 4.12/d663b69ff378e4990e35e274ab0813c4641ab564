nvme-fc: fix status code handling in nvme_fc_fcpio_done

nvme_complete_async_event expects the little endian status code
including the phase bit, and a new completion handler I plan to
introduce will do so as well.

Change the status variable into the little endian format with the
phase bit used in the NVMe CQE to fix / enable this.
