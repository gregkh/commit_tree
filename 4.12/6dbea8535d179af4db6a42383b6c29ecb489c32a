dell-led: remove GUID check from dell_micmute_led_set()

As dell_micmute_led_set() no longer uses the dell_wmi_perform_query()
method, which was removed in commit 0c41a08e131d ("dell-led: use
dell_smbios_send_request() for performing SMBIOS calls"), the
DELL_APP_GUID check is redundant and thus can be safely removed.
