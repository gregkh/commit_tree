efi/arm32-stub: Allow boot-time allocations in the vmlinux region

The arm32 kernel decompresses itself to the base of DRAM unconditionally,
and so it is the EFI stub's job to ensure that the region is available.

Currently, we do this by creating an allocation there, and giving up if
that fails. However, any boot services regions occupying this area are
not an issue, given that the decompressor executes strictly after the
stub calls ExitBootServices().

So let's try a bit harder to proceed if the initial allocation fails,
and check whether any memory map entries occupying the region may be
considered safe.
