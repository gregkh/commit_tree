block, bfq: boost the throughput with random I/O on NCQ-capable HDDs

This patch is basically the counterpart, for NCQ-capable rotational
devices, of the previous patch. Exactly as the previous patch does on
flash-based devices and for any workload, this patch disables device
idling on rotational devices, but only for random I/O. In fact, only
with these queues disabling idling boosts the throughput on
NCQ-capable rotational devices. To not break service guarantees,
idling is disabled for NCQ-enabled rotational devices only when the
same symmetry conditions considered in the previous patches hold.
