USB: serial: mct_u232: fix big-endian baud-rate handling

Drop erroneous cpu_to_le32 when setting the baud rate, something which
corrupted the divisor on big-endian hosts.

Found using sparse:

	warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different base types)
	    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [usertype] val
	    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>
