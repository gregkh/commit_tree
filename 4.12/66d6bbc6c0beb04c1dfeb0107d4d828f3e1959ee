ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Update sig_bits based on converter capability

When creating the codec dai, use sig_bits to update the max bps based
on the codec capability. So both the link DMA and codec format will be
calculated based on DAI sig_bits.

So update the sig_bits with converter capability and use the sig_bits
for HDA format calculation.
