netvsc: fix dereference before null check errors

ndev is being checked to see if it is a null pointer however before
the null check ndev is being dereferenced; hence there is a potential
null pointer dereference bug that needs fixing. Fix this by only
dereferencing ndev after the null check.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1420760, CID#140761 ("Dereference
before null check")
