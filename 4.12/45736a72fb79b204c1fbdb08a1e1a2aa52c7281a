drivers/perf: arm_pmu: add ACPI framework

This patch adds framework code to handle parsing PMU data out of the
MADT, sanity checking this, and managing the association of CPUs (and
their interrupts) with appropriate logical PMUs.

For the time being, we expect that only one PMU driver (PMUv3) will make
use of this, and we simply pass in a single probe function.

This is based on an earlier patch from Jeremy Linton.
