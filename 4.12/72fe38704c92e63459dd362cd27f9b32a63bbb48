Input: synaptics-rmi4 - use dev_driver_string when registering interrupt

When IRQ handling was moved to rmi_driver in 3aeed5b the naming of the
interrupt changed from "rmi4_i2c" to "2-0020" (or similar). This patch
restores the previous behaviour and makes the interrupt easier to identify
in /proc/interrupts.
