iio: adc: cpcap: Add minimal support for CPCAP PMIC ADC

On Motorola phones like droid 4 there is a custom CPCAP PMIC. This PMIC
has ADCs that are used for battery charging and USB PHY VBUS and ID pin
detection.

Unfortunately the only documentation for this ADC seems to be the
Motorola mapphone Linux kernel tree. I have tested that reading raw and
scaled values works, but I have not used the timed sampling that the ADC
seems to support.

Let's add a minimal support for it so we can eventually provide IIO
channels for the related battery charging and USB PHY drivers.
