ALSA: firewire_lib: add tracepoints for packets without CIP headers

Unique protocol is used for RME Fireface series. In this protocol,
payload format for isochronous packet is not compliant to CIP in
IEC 61883-1/6. The packet includes data blocks just with data channels,
without headers and any metadata.

In previous commits, ALSA IEC 61883-1/6 engine supports this protocol.
However, tracepoints are not supported yet, unlike implementation for
IEC 61883-1/6 protocol. This commit adds support of tracepoints for
the protocol.
