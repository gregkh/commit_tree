mtd: spi-nor: add driver for STM32 quad spi flash controller

The quadspi is a specialized communication interface targeting single,
dual or quad SPI Flash memories.

It can operate in any of the following modes:
-indirect mode: all the operations are performed using the quadspi
 registers
-read memory-mapped mode: the external Flash memory is mapped to the
 microcontroller address space and is seen by the system as if it was
 an internal memory
