ARM: Expose the VA/IDMAP offset

The KVM code needs to be able to compute the address of
symbols in its idmap page (the equivalent of a virt_to_idmap()
call). Unfortunately, virt_to_idmap is slightly complicated,
depending on the use of arch_phys_to_idmap_offset or not, and
none of that is readily available at HYP.

Instead, expose a single kimage_voffset variable which contains the
offset between a kernel VA and its idmap address, enabling the
VA->IDMAP conversion. This allows the KVM code to behave similarily
to its arm64 counterpart.
