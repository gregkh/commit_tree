fs/affs: bugfix: enable writes on OFS disks

We called unconditionally affs_bread_ino() with create 0 resulting in
"error (device ...): get_block(): strange block request 0"
when trying to write on AFFS OFS format.

This patch adds create parameter to that function.
0 for affs_readpage_ofs()
1 for affs_write_begin_ofs()
