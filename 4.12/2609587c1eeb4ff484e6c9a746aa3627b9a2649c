xen-blkfront: don't use req->errors

xen-blkfron is the last users using rq->errros for passing back error to
blk-mq, and I'd like to get rid of that.  In the longer run the driver
should be moving more of the completion processing into .complete, but
this is the minimal change to move forward for now.
