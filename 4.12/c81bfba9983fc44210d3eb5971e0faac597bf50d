nvme: only setup block integrity if supported by the driver

Currently only the PCIe driver supports metadata, so we should not claim
integrity support for the other drivers.  This prevents nasty crashes
with targets that advertise metadata support on fabrics.

Also use the opportunity to factor out some code into a separate helper
that isn't even compiled if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INTEGRITY is disabled.
