aspeed-lpc-ctrl: include linux/types.h for uapi header

The newly added header file triggers a sanity check:

usr/include/linux/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.h:44: found __[us]{8,16,32,64} type without #include <linux/types.h>

We should include linux/types.h explicitly to ensure the header
can be included from user space.
