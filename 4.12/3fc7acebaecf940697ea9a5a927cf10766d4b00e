s390/cpum_cf: add IBM z13 counter event names

Add the event names for the IBM z13/z13s specific CPU-MF counters.

Also improve the merging of the generic and model specific events
so that their sysfs attribute definitions completely reside in
memory.  Hence, flagging the generic event attribute definitions
as initdata too.
