srcu: Move rcu_init_levelspread() to rcu_tree_node.h

This commit moves the rcu_init_levelspread() function from
kernel/rcu/tree.c to kernel/rcu/rcu.h so that SRCU can access it.  This is
another step towards enabling SRCU to create its own combining tree.
This commit is code-movement only, give or take knock-on adjustments.
