drm/i915/dsi: VLV/CHT Only wait for LP00 on MIPI PORT A

On some devices only MIPI PORT C is used, in this case checking the
MIPI PORT A CTRL AFE_LATCHOUT bit (there is no such bit for PORT C
on VLV/CHT) will result in false positive "DSI LP not going Low" errors
as this checks the PORT A clk status.

In case both ports are used we have already checked the AFE_LATCHOUT
bit when going through the for_each_dsi_port() loop for PORT A and
checking the same bit again for PORT C is a no-op.
