net: bcmgenet: add support for the GENETv5 hardware

This commit adds support for the GENETv5 implementation.

The GENETv5 reports a major version of 6 instead of 5 so compensate
for this when verifying the configuration of the driver.  Also the
EPHY revision is now contained in the MDIO registers of the PHY so
the EPHY revision of 0 in GENET_VER_FMT is expected for GENETv5.
