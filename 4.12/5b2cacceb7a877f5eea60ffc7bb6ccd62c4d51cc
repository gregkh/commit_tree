i2c: designware-baytrail: Acquire P-Unit access on bus acquire

Acquire P-Unit access to stop others from accessing the P-Unit while the
PMIC i2c bus is in use. This is necessary because accessing the P-Unit
from the kernel may result in the P-Unit trying to access the PMIC i2c
bus, which results in a hang when it happens while we own the PMIC i2c
bus semaphore.
