md: add raid4/5/6 journal mode switching API

Commit 2ded370373a4 ("md/r5cache: State machine for raid5-cache write
back mode") added support for "write-back" caching on the raid journal
device.

In order to allow the dm-raid target to switch between the available
"write-through" and "write-back" modes, provide a new
r5c_journal_mode_set() API.

Use the new API in existing r5c_journal_mode_store()
