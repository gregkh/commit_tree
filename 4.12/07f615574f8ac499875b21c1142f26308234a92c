ipv6: Do not leak throw route references

While commit 73ba57bfae4a ("ipv6: fix backtracking for throw routes")
does good job on error propagation to the fib_rules_lookup()
in fib rules core framework that also corrects throw routes
handling, it does not solve route reference leakage problem
happened when we return -EAGAIN to the fib_rules_lookup()
and leave routing table entry referenced in arg->result.

If rule with matched throw route isn't last matched in the
list we overwrite arg->result losing reference on throw
route stored previously forever.

We also partially revert commit ab997ad40839 ("ipv6: fix the
incorrect return value of throw route") since we never return
routing table entry with dst.error == -EAGAIN when
CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES is on. Also there is no point
to check for RTF_REJECT flag since it is always set throw
route.
