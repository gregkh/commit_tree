USB: usbip: fix nonconforming hub descriptor

Fix up the root-hub descriptor to accommodate the variable-length
DeviceRemovable and PortPwrCtrlMask fields, while marking all ports as
removable (and leaving the reserved bit zero unset).

Also add a build-time constraint on VHCI_HC_PORTS which must never be
greater than USB_MAXCHILDREN (but this was only enforced through a
KConfig constant).

This specifically fixes the descriptor layout whenever VHCI_HC_PORTS is
greater than seven (default is 8).
