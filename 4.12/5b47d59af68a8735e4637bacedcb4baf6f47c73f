fix braino in generic_file_read_iter()

Wrong sign of iov_iter_revert() argument.  Unfortunately, slipped through
the testing, since most of the time we don't do anything to the iterator
afterwards and potential oops on walking the iter->iov too far backwards
is too infrequent to be easily triggered.

Add a sanity check in iov_iter_revert() to catch bugs like this one;
fortunately, the same braino hadn't happened in other callers, but we'd
better have a warning if such thing crops up.
