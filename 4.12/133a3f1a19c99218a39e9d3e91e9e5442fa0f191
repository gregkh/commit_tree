ARM: dts: r8a7794: Add INTC-SYS clock to device tree

Link the ARM GIC to the INTC-SYS module clock, and add it to the "always
on" PM Domain, so it can be power managed using that clock.

Note that currently the GIC-400 driver doesn't support module clocks nor
Runtime PM, so this must be handled as a critical clock.
