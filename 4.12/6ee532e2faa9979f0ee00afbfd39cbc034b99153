irqchip/gemini: Refactor Gemini driver to reflect Faraday origin

The Gemini irqchip turns out to be a standard IP component from
Faraday Technology named FTINTC010 after some research and new
information.

- Rename the driver and all symbols to reflect the new information.
- Add the new compatible string "faraday,ftintc010"
- Create a Kconfig symbol CONFIG_FARADAY_FTINTC010 so that SoCs
  using this interrupt controller can easily select and reuse it
  instead of hardwiring it to ARCH_GEMINI

I have created a separate patch to select the new Kconfig symbol
from the Gemini machine, which will be merged through the ARM
SoC tree.
