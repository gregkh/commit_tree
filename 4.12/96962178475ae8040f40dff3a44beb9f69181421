leds: lp3952: Remove ACPI support for lp3952

In ACPI world any ID should be carefully chosen and registered
officially. The discussion [1] as I read it gets to wilful assignment
an ID for non-existing real DSDT example.

Rafael already told [2] how this device would be enumerated using
compatible string. To be more precise look at the possible DSDT excerpt
below:

	Device (LDX0) {
		Name (_HID, "PRP0001")
		Name (_DDN, "TI LP3952 compatible led driver")
		...
	})

	Name (_DSD, Package () {
		ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
		Package () {
			Package () {"compatible", "ti,lp3952"},
			...
		}
	})

Based on above, remove non-official ACPI IDs and enumeration from the
driver.

Note: currently driver has no compatible strings at all, to make above
working one should add at least one.
