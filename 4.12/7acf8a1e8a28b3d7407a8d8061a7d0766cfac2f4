Replace 2 jiffies with sysctl netdev_budget_usecs to enable softirq tuning

Constants used for tuning are generally a bad idea, especially as hardware
changes over time. Replace the constant 2 jiffies with sysctl variable
netdev_budget_usecs to enable sysadmins to tune the softirq processing.
Also document the variable.

For example, a very fast machine might tune this to 1000 microseconds,
while my regression testing 486DX-25 needs it to be 4000 microseconds on
a nearly idle network to prevent time_squeeze from being incremented.

Version 2: changed jiffies to microseconds for predictable units.
