netfilter: nf_nat: Fix return NF_DROP in nfnetlink_parse_nat_setup

The __nf_nat_alloc_null_binding invokes nf_nat_setup_info which may
return NF_DROP when memory is exhausted, so convert NF_DROP to -ENOMEM
to make ctnetlink happy. Or ctnetlink_setup_nat treats it as a success
when one error NF_DROP happens actully.
