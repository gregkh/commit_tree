bpf: provide a generic macro for percpu values for selftests

To overcome bugs as described and fixed in 89087c456fb5 ("bpf: Fix
values type used in test_maps"), provide a generic BPF_DECLARE_PERCPU()
and bpf_percpu() accessor macro for all percpu map values used in
tests.

Declaring variables works as follows (also works for structs):

  BPF_DECLARE_PERCPU(uint32_t, my_value);

They can then be accessed normally as uint32_t type through:

  bpf_percpu(my_value, <cpu_nr>)

For example:

  bpf_percpu(my_value, 0)++;

Implicitly, we make sure that the passed type is allocated and aligned
by gcc at least on a 8-byte boundary, so that it works together with
the map lookup/update syscall for percpu maps. We use it as a usage
example in test_maps, so that others are free to adapt this into their
code when necessary.
