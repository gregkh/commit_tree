drm/sun4i: Fix up error path cleanup for master bind function

The master bind function calls numerous drm functions which initialize
underlying structures. It also tries to bind the various components
of the display pipeline, some of which may add additional drm objects.

This patch adds proper cleanup functions in the error path of the
master bind function.

This requires the patch "drm/sun4i: Move drm_mode_config_cleanup call
to main driver", which splits out drm_mode_config_cleanup from
sun4i_framebuffer_free so we can call it separately.
