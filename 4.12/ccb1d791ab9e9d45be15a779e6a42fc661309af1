KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Fix pending table sync

In its_sync_lpi_pending_table() we currently ignore the
target_vcpu of the LPIs. We sync the pending bit found in
the vcpu pending table even if the LPI is not targeting it.

Also in vgic_its_cmd_handle_invall() we are supposed to
read the config table data for the LPIs associated to the
collection ID. At the moment we refresh all LPI config
information.

This patch passes a vpcu to vgic_copy_lpi_list() so that
this latter returns a snapshot of the LPIs targeting this
CPU and only those.
