ohci-pci: add qemu quirk

On a loaded virtualization host (dozen guests booting at the same time)
it may happen that the ohci controller emulation doesn't manage to do
timely frame processing, with the result that the io watchdog fires and
considers the controller being dead, even though it's only the emulation
being unusual slow due to the load peak.

So, add a quirk for qemu and don't use the watchdog in case we figure we
are running on emulated ohci.  The virtual ohci controller masquerades
as apple ohci controller, but we can identify it by subsystem id.
