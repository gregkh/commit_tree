printk: use console_trylock() in console_cpu_notify()

There is no need to always call blocking console_lock() in
console_cpu_notify(), it's quite possible that console_sem can
be locked by other CPU on the system, either already printing
or soon to begin printing the messages. console_lock() in this
case can simply block CPU hotplug for unknown period of time
(console_unlock() is time unbound). Not that hotplug is very
fast, but still, with other CPUs being online and doing
printk() console_cpu_notify() can stuck.

Use console_trylock() instead and opt-out if console_sem is
already acquired from another CPU, since that CPU will do
the printing for us.
