net/phy: micrel: configure intterupts after autoneg workaround

The commit ("net/phy: micrel: Add workaround for bad autoneg") fixes an
autoneg failure case by resetting the hardware. This turns off
intterupts. Things will work themselves out if the phy polls, as it will
figure out it's state during a poll. However if the phy uses only
intterupts, the phy will stall, since interrupts are off. This patch
fixes the issue by calling config_intr after resetting the phy.
