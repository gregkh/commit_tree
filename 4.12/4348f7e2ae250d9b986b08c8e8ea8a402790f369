FPGA: Add TS-7300 FPGA manager

Add support for loading bitstreams on the Altera Cyclone II FPGA
populated on the TS-7300 board. This is done through the configuration
and data registers offered through a memory interface between the EP93xx
SoC and the FPGA via an intermediate CPLD device.

The EP93xx SoC on the TS-7300 does not have direct means of configuring
the on-board FPGA other than by using the special memory mapped
interface to the CPLD. No other entity on the system can control the
FPGA bitstream.
