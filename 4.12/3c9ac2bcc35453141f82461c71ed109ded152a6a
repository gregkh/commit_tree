powerpc/mm/radix: Drop support for CPUs without lockless tlbie

Currently the radix TLB code includes support for CPUs that do *not*
have MMU_FTR_LOCKLESS_TLBIE. On those CPUs we are required to take a
global spinlock before issuing a tlbie.

Radix can only be built for 64-bit Book3s CPUs, and of those, only
POWER4, 970, Cell and PA6T do not have MMU_FTR_LOCKLESS_TLBIE. Although
it's possible to build a kernel with Radix support that can also boot on
those CPUs, we happen to know that in reality none of those CPUs support
the Radix MMU, so the code can never actually run on those CPUs.

So remove the native_tlbie_lock in the Radix TLB code.

Note that there is another lock of the same name in the hash code, which
is unaffected by this patch.
