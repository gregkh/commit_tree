pinctrl: rockchip: Add mux recalculation support

Some pins are special at a bank so that add
IOMUX_RECALCED type to indicate which iomux source
of the bank need to be recalculated. If the mux
recalculateed callback and IOMUX_RECALCED type
were set, recalculate the pins' iomux by using
mux recalculated data struct.
