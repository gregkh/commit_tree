staging: media: atomisp: Compress return logic into one line.

Simplify function return by merging assignment and return into a single
line. The following coccinelle script is used to fix this issue.

expression e;
local idexpression ret;
@@

-ret = e;
-return ret;
+return e;

This patch also removes unnecessary declarations.
