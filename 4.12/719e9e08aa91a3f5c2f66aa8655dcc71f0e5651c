staging: lustre: osc: remove obsolete asserts

Remove the no longer needed assert in the function
osc_cache_truncate_start(). The assertion in
osc_object_prune() will become faulty with upcoming
changes. The reason this will become a problem is
that there may exist freeing pages in object's
radix tree at the time of osc_object_prune(), which
causes failure at the assertion of (osc->oo_npages == 0).
This patch prevents that problem from happening.
