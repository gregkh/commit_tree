cpuidle: powernv: Avoid a branch in the core snooze_loop() loop

When in the snooze_loop() we want to take up the least amount of
resources. On my version of gcc (6.3), we end up with an extra
branch because it predicts snooze_timeout_en to be false, whereas it
is almost always true.

Use likely() to avoid the branch and be a little nicer to the
other non idle threads on the core.
