ALSA: hda - Support Gigabyte Gaming board with dual Realtek codecs

This patch adds some workarounds to make Gigabyte GA-AX370 Gaming 5
board working without the conflicts of kctls, etc.  In general, the
dual codec configs result in the conflicts of the following stuff:
- Master controls
- Capture controls
- Analog loopback controls
In addition, the auto-mute and the auto-mic can't work well among
multiple codecs.

The current "solution" is to disable all these features, and use UCM
for a better PulseAudio management.  For a dedicated UCM profile, the
patch overrides the card longname so that the system an get a unique
profile path.
