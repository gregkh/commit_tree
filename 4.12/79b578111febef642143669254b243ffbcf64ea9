cpuidle: powernv: Don't bounce between low and very low thread priority

The core of snooze_loop() continually bounces between low and very
low thread priority. Changing thread priorities is an expensive
operation that can negatively impact other threads on a core.

All CPUs that can run PowerNV support very low priority, so we can
avoid the change completely.
