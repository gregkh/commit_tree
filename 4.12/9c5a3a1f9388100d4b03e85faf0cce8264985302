sunvnet: xoff not needed when removing port link

The sunvnet netdev is connected to the controlling ldom's vswitch
for network bridging.  However, for higher performance between ldoms,
there also is a channel between each client ldom.  These connections are
represented in the sunvnet driver by a queue for each ldom.  The driver
uses select_queue to tell the stack which queue to use by tracking the mac
addresses on the other end of each port.  When a connected ldom shuts down,
the driver receives an LDC_EVENT_RESET and the port is removed from the
driver, thus a queue with no ldom on the other end will never be selected
for Tx.

The driver was trying to reinforce the "don't use this queue" notion with
netif_tx_stop_queue() and netif_tx_wake_queue(), which really should only
be used to signal a Tx queue is full (aka XOFF).  This misuse of queue
state resulted in NETDEV WATCHDOG messages and lots of unnecessary calls
into the driver's tx_timeout handler.  Simply removing these takes care
of the problem.
