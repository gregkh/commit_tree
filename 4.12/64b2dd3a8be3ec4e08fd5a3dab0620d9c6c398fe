MIPS: BPF: Use unsigned access for unsigned SKB fields.

The SKB vlan_tci and queue_mapping fields are unsigned, don't sign
extend these in the BPF JIT.  In the vlan_tci case, the value gets
masked so the change is not needed for correctness, but do it anyway
for agreement with the types defined in struct sk_buff.
