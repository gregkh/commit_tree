IB/hns: Use kcalloc() in hns_roce_buddy_init()

* Multiplications for the size determination of memory allocations
  indicated that array data structures should be processed.
  Thus use the corresponding function "kcalloc".

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* Replace the specification of data types by pointer dereferences
  to make the corresponding size determinations a bit safer according to
  the Linux coding style convention.
