drm/i915: Apply a cond_resched() to the saturated signaler

If the engine is continually completing nops, we can saturate the
signaler and keep it working indefinitely. This angers the NMI watchdog!

A good example is to disable semaphores on snb and run igt/gem_exec_nop -
the parallel, multi-engine workloads are more than sufficient to hog the
CPU, preventing the system from even processing ICMP echo replies.

v2: Tvrtko dug into cond_resched() on x86 and found that it only
depended upon preempt_count and not tif_need_resched() - which means
that we would always call schedule() at that point.
