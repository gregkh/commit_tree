vfio: ccw: introduce channel program interfaces

Introduce ccwchain structure and helper functions that can be used to
handle a channel program issued from a virtual machine.

The following limitations apply:
1. Supports only prefetch enabled mode.
2. Supports idal(c64) ccw chaining.
3. Supports 4k idaw.
4. Supports ccw1.
5. Supports direct ccw chaining by translating them to idal ccws.

CCW translation requires to leverage the vfio_(un)pin_pages interfaces
to pin/unpin sets of mem pages frequently. Currently we have a lack of
support to do this in an efficient way. So we introduce pfn_array data
structure and helper functions to handle pin/unpin operations here.
