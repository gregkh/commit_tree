fscrypt: remove unnecessary checks for NULL operations

The functions in fs/crypto/*.c are only called by filesystems configured
with encryption support.  Since the ->get_context(), ->set_context(),
and ->empty_dir() operations are always provided in that case (and must
be, otherwise there would be no way to get/set encryption policies, or
in the case of ->get_context() even access encrypted files at all),
there is no need to check for these operations being NULL and we can
remove these unneeded checks.
