qxl: fix qxl_conn_get_modes

Call qxl_add_monitors_config_modes() unconditionally.  Do all sanity
checks in that function.

Fix sanity checks.  monitors_config is the current monitor
configuration, whereas client_monitors_config is the configuration
requested by the spice client.  So when filling the mode list, based on
the spice client request, we need to look at
client_monitors_config->count not monitors_config->count.
