netfilter: nft_ct: allow to set ctnetlink event types of a connection

By default the kernel emits all ctnetlink events for a connection.
This allows to select the types of events to generate.

This can be used to e.g. only send DESTROY events but no NEW/UPDATE ones
and will work even if sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_events is set to 0.

This was already possible via iptables' CT target, but the nft version has
the advantage that it can also be used with already-established conntracks.

The added nf_ct_is_template() check isn't a bug fix as we only support
mark and labels (and unlike ecache the conntrack core doesn't copy those).
