blk-mq: update ->init_request and ->exit_request prototypes

Remove the request_idx parameter, which can't be used safely now that we
support I/O schedulers with blk-mq.  Except for a superflous check in
mtip32xx it was unused anyway.

Also pass the tag_set instead of just the driver data - this allows drivers
to avoid some code duplication in a follow on cleanup.
