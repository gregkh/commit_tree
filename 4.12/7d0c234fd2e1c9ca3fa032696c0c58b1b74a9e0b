Do not return number of bytes written for ioctl CIFS_IOC_COPYCHUNK_FILE

commit 620d8745b35d ("Introduce cifs_copy_file_range()") changes the
behaviour of the cifs ioctl call CIFS_IOC_COPYCHUNK_FILE. In case of
successful writes, it now returns the number of bytes written. This
return value is treated as an error by the xfstest cifs/001. Depending
on the errno set at that time, this may or may not result in the test
failing.

The patch fixes this by setting the return value to 0 in case of
successful writes.
