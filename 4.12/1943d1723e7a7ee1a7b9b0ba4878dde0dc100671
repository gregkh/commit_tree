Input: silead - disable interrupt during suspend

When we put the touchscreen controller in low-power mode the irq
pin may trigger (float) and if we then try to read a data packet we
get the following error in dmesg:

[  478.801017] silead_ts i2c-MSSL1680:00: Data read error -121

This commit disables the irq during suspend/resume fixing this error.
