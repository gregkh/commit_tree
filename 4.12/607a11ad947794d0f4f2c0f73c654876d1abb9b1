fs: ubifs: replace CURRENT_TIME_SEC with current_time

CURRENT_TIME_SEC is not y2038 safe.  current_time() will be transitioned
to use 64 bit time along with vfs in a separate patch.  There is no plan
to transition CURRENT_TIME_SEC to use y2038 safe time interfaces.

current_time() returns timestamps according to the granularities set in
the inode's super_block.  The granularity check to call
current_fs_time() or CURRENT_TIME_SEC is not required.

Use current_time() directly to update inode timestamp.  Use
timespec_trunc during file system creation, before the first inode is
created.
