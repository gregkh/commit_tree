cpufreq: schedutil: Use policy-dependent transition delays

Make the schedutil governor take the initial (default) value of the
rate_limit_us sysfs attribute from the (new) transition_delay_us
policy parameter (to be set by the scaling driver).

That will allow scaling drivers to make schedutil use smaller default
values of rate_limit_us and reduce the default average time interval
between consecutive frequency changes.

Make intel_pstate set transition_delay_us to 500.
