Input: tsc2007 - add iio interface to read external ADC input and temperature

The tsc2007 chip not only has a resistive touch screen controller but
also an external AUX adc imput which can be used for an ambient
light sensor, battery voltage monitoring or any general purpose.

Additionally it can measure the chip temperature.

This extension provides an iio interface for these adc channels.

Since it is not wasting much resources and is very straightforward,
we simply provide all other adc channels as optional iio interfaces
as weel. This can be used for debugging or special applications.

This patch also splits the tsc2007 driver in several source files:
tsc2007.h -- constants, structs and stubs
tsc2007_core.c -- functional parts of the original driver
tsc2007_iio.c -- the optional iio stuff

Makefile magic allows to conditionally link the iio stuff
if CONFIG_IIO=y or =m in a way that it works with
CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_TSC2007=m.
