qed: Correct default VF coalescing configuration

When starting the VF's vport, the PF would first configure
the status blocks of the VF and then reset them.
That would cause some of the configured information to be lost -
specifically it would mean that all the VFs queues would use
the Rx coalescing state-machine of the status block.
