bpf: add various verifier test cases

This patch adds various verifier test cases:

1) A test case for the pruning issue when tracking alignment
   is used.
2) Various PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE_OR_NULL tests to make sure pointer
   arithmetic turns such register into UNKNOWN_VALUE type.
3) Test cases for the special treatment of LD_ABS/LD_IND to
   make sure verifier doesn't break calling convention here.
   Latter is needed, since f.e. arm64 JIT uses r1 - r5 for
   storing temporary data, so they really must be marked as
   NOT_INIT.
