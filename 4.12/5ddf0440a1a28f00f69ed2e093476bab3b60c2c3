md/r5cache: handle sync with data in write back cache

Currently, sync of raid456 array cannot make progress when hitting
data in writeback r5cache.

This patch fixes this issue by flushing cached data of the stripe
before processing the sync request. This is achived by:

1. In handle_stripe(), do not set STRIPE_SYNCING if the stripe is
   in write back cache;
2. In r5c_try_caching_write(), handle the stripe in sync with write
   through;
3. In do_release_stripe(), make stripe in sync write out and send
   it to the state machine.

Shaohua: explictly set STRIPE_HANDLE after write out completed
