PCI: Add pcibios_default_alignment() for arch-specific alignment control

When VFIO passes through a PCI device to a guest, it does not allow the
guest to mmap BARs that are smaller than PAGE_SIZE unless it can reserve
the rest of the page (see vfio_pci_probe_mmaps()). This is because a page
might contain several small BARs for unrelated devices and a guest should
not be able to access all of them.

VFIO emulates guest accesses to non-mappable BARs, which is functional but
slow. On systems with large page sizes, e.g., PowerNV with 64K pages, BARs
are more likely to share a page and performance is more likely to be a
problem.

Add a weak function to set default alignment for all PCI devices.  An arch
can override it to force the PCI core to place memory BARs on their own
pages.
