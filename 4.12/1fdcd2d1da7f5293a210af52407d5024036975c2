scsi: qla2xxx: remove some redundant pointer assignments

There are several local or function parameter pointers that are being
assigned NULL after a kfree where and these have no effect and hence can
be removed.

Fixes various cppcheck warnings:

"Assignment of function parameter has no effect outside the
function. Did you forget dereferencing it"
