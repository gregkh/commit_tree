arm: KVM: Make unexpected register accesses inject an undef

Reads from write-only system registers are generally confined to
EL1 and not propagated to EL2 (that's what the architecture
mantates). In order to be sure that we have a sane behaviour
even in the unlikely event that we have a broken system, we still
handle it in KVM. Same goes for write to RO registers.

In that case, let's inject an undef into the guest.
