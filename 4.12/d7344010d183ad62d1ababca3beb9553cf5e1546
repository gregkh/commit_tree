ASoC: jack: add snd_soc_codec_set_jack

There are many codecs with the capability of jack detection. Usually,
we create a jack on machine driver but there is no common function for
machine driver to deliver the jack pointer to codec driver.
snd_soc_codec_set_jack can be used for delivering the jack pointer to
codec driver and enable the jack detection function. To make it work,
codec driver need to define a callback function to receive the jack
pointer and do all necessary procedure for enabling jack detection.
