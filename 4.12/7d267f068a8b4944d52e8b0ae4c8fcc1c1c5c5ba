drm/omap: work-around for errata i886

DRA7 errata i886 (FPDLink PLL Unlocks With Certain SoC PLL M/N Values)
says that FPDLink is sensitive to jitter on the vout clock, and that low
PLL M and N values result in more jitter than high M and N values.

This patch implements a workaround for the problem by changing the PLL
setup to search for clocks starting from high M and N values, instead of
low values. This should not cause any functional change, and only
reduces the jitter.
