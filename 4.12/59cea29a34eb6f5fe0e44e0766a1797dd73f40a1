s390: remove HAVE_ARCH_EARLY_PFN_TO_NID select statement

HAVE_ARCH_EARLY_PFN_TO_NID selects a not present Kconfig
option. Therefore remove it.
Given that the first call of early_pfn_to_nid() happens after
numa_setup() finished to establish the memory to node mapping, there
is no need to implement an architecture private version of
__early_pfn_to_nid() like (only) ia64 does.
