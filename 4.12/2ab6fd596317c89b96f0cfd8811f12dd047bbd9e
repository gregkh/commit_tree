staging: ks7010: factor out send stop request

Function contains compound statement delineated by lone braces. This
statement represents a discreet set of functionality and thus can be
factored out into a separate function. Using a separate function
instead of a compound statement increases readability, reduces code
indentation, reduces function length, and generally looks more tidy.

Factor compound statement out to separate function.
