ath: Fix updating radar flags for coutry code India

As per latest regulatory update for India, channel 52, 56, 60, 64
is no longer restricted to DFS. Enabling DFS/no infra flags in driver
results in applying all DFS related restrictions (like doing CAC etc
before this channel moves to 'available state') for these channels
even though the country code is programmed as 'India' in he hardware,
fix this by relaxing the frequency range while applying RADAR flags
only if the country code is programmed to India. If the frequency range
needs to modified based on different country code, ath_is_radar_freq
can be extended/modified dynamically.
