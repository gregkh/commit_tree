ovl: don't set origin on broken lower hardlink

When copying up a file that has multiple hard links we need to break any
association with the origin file.  This makes copy-up be essentially an
atomic replace.

The new file has nothing to do with the old one (except having the same
data and metadata initially), so don't set the overlay.origin attribute.

We can relax this in the future when we are able to index upper object by
origin.
