tracing/kprobes: Allow to create probe with a module name starting with a digit

Always try to parse an address, since kstrtoul() will safely fail when
given a symbol as input. If that fails (which will be the case for a
symbol), try to parse a symbol instead.

This allows creating a probe such as:

    p:probe/vlan_gro_receive 8021q:vlan_gro_receive+0

Which is necessary for this command to work:

    perf probe -m 8021q -a vlan_gro_receive
