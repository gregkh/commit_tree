powerpc/mm: Fix hash table dump when memory is not contiguous

The current behaviour of the hash table dump assumes that memory is contiguous
and iterates from the start of memory to (start + size of memory). When memory
isn't physically contiguous, this doesn't work.

If memory exists at 0-5 GB and 6-10 GB then the current approach will check if
entries exist in the hash table from 0GB to 9GB. This patch changes the
behaviour to iterate over any holes up to the end of memory.
