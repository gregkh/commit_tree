drm/i915/dsi: Merge intel_dsi_disable/enable into their respective callers

intel_dsi_disable/enable only have one caller, merge them into their
respective callers.

Change msleep(2) into usleep_range(2000, 5000) to make checkpatch happy,
otherwise no functional changes.

The main advantage of this change is that it makes it easier to
follow all the steps of the panel enable / disable sequence when
reading the code.
