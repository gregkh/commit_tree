extcon: arizona: Wait for any running HPDETs to complete on jack removal

As the HPDET can't be aborted mid way through we should not allow any new
insertion to be processed until the previous HPDET has finished. It is very
unlikely but with low enough debounce settings you could start a new HPDET
before the old one has completed, which results in an erroneous reading.
