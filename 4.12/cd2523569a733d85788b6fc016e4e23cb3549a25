drm: Always prepare null framebuffer in transitional helper

Despite the documentation claim that cleanup_fb will match prior calls
to prepare_fb, in case of NULL framebuffers in the transitional helpers,
the code will skip the call to prepare_fb but not the corresponding
cleanup_fb call.  This asymmetry in semantics is unnecessarily surprising
for developers transitioning drivers to atomic model, specially because
the final atomic handlers don't have the issue - the prepare_fb is
always called, despite the new state framebuffer being null.

The only current user of the transitional helper that doesn't take care
of null framebuffers explicitly inside the prepare_fb hook is
atmel_hlcdc, so we take special care to make sure we don't break
anything there.
