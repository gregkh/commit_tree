ovl: persistent inode number for directories

stat(2) on overlay directories reports the overlay temp inode
number, which is constant across copy up, but is not persistent.

When all layers are on the same fs, report the copy up origin inode
number for directories.

This inode number is persistent, unique across the overlay mount and
constant across copy up.
