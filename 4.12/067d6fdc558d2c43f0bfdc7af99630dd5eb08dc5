usb: gadget: udc: renesas_usb3: fix deadlock by spinlock

This patch fixes an issue that this driver is possible to cause
deadlock by double-spinclocked in renesas_usb3_stop_controller().
So, this patch removes spinlock API calling in renesas_usb3_stop().
(In other words, the previous code had a redundant lock.)
