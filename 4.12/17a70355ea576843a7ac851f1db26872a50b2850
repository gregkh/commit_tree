of: fix sparse warnings in fdt, irq, reserved mem, and resolver code

sparse generates the following warnings in drivers/of/:

../drivers/of/fdt.c:63:36: warning: cast to restricted __be32
../drivers/of/fdt.c:68:33: warning: cast to restricted __be32
../drivers/of/irq.c:105:88: warning: incorrect type in initializer (different base types)
../drivers/of/irq.c:105:88:    expected restricted __be32
../drivers/of/irq.c:105:88:    got int
../drivers/of/irq.c:526:35: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different modifiers)
../drivers/of/irq.c:526:35:    expected int ( *const [usertype] irq_init_cb )( ... )
../drivers/of/irq.c:526:35:    got void const *const data
../drivers/of/of_reserved_mem.c:200:50: warning: incorrect type in initializer (different modifiers)
../drivers/of/of_reserved_mem.c:200:50:    expected int ( *[usertype] initfn )( ... )
../drivers/of/of_reserved_mem.c:200:50:    got void const *const data
../drivers/of/resolver.c:95:42: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
../drivers/of/resolver.c:95:42:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [usertype] <noident>
../drivers/of/resolver.c:95:42:    got restricted __be32 [usertype] <noident>

All these are harmless type mismatches fixed by adjusting the types.
