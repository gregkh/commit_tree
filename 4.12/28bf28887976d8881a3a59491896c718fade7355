KVM: x86: fix user triggerable warning in kvm_apic_accept_events()

If we already entered/are about to enter SMM, don't allow switching to
INIT/SIPI_RECEIVED, otherwise the next call to kvm_apic_accept_events()
will report a warning.

Same applies if we are already in MP state INIT_RECEIVED and SMM is
requested to be turned on. Refuse to set the VCPU events in this case.
