HID: wacom: Move wacom_remote_irq and wacom_remote_status_irq

These two functions awkwardly break up the otherwise-contiguous chunk of
related Intuos IRQ functions with a 500 line tangent about the operation
of the EKR. Their presence makes it difficult to read/navigate through the
the Intuos code. Since there is no dependency between these functions, it
is possible to simply move them down somewhat. This commit moves them
to be after the final Intuos IRQ function.
