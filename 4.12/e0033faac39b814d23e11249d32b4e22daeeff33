MAINTAINERS: drop broken reference to i2c/trivial-devices

Due to RST rework, the reference to i2c/trivial-devices was changed, but the
result is broken. However, let's just drop the whole reference, since it
doesn't make sense in the first place to reference this "global" file
for a single driver.
