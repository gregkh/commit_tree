i40e/i40evf: Add tracepoints

This patch adds tracepoints to the i40e and i40evf drivers to which
BPF programs can be attached for feature testing and verification.
It's expected that an attached BPF program will identify and count or
log some interesting subset of traffic. The bcc-tools package is
helpful there for containing all the BPF arcana in a handy Python
wrapper. Though you can make these tracepoints log trace messages, the
messages themselves probably won't be very useful (other to verify the
tracepoint is being called while you're debugging your BPF program).

The idea here is that tracepoints have such low performance cost when
disabled that we can leave these in the upstream drivers. This may
eventually enable the instrumentation of unmodified customer systems
should the need arise to verify a NIC feature is working as expected.
In general this enables one set of feature verification tools to be
used on these drivers whether they're built with the kernel or
separately.

Users are advised against using these tracepoints for anything other
than a diagnostic tool. They have a performance impact when enabled,
and their exact placement and form may change as we see how well they
work in practice for the purposes above.
