fs/affs: bugfix: make symbolic links work again

AFFS symbolic links were broken since kernel 2.6.29

Problem was bisected to the following

commit ebd09abbd969 ("vfs: ensure page symlinks are NUL-terminated")
commit 035146851cfa ("vfs: introduce helper function to safely
NUL-terminate symlinks")

AFFS wasn't setting inode size when reading symbolic link from disk or
creating a new one. Result was zero allocation in pagecache.

ln -s file symlink

ls -lrt

file
symlink ->

This patch adds inode isize information on inode get and symbolic link
addition.
