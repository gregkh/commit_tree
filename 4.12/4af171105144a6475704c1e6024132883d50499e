x86/boot/32: Rewrite test_wp_bit()

This code seems to be very old and has gotten only minor updates.
It's overcomplicated and has a bunch of comments that are, at best,
of purely historical interest.  Nowadays we have a shiny function
probe_kernel_write() that does more or less exactly what we need.
Use it.

I switched the page that we test from swapper_pg_dir to
empty_zero_page because writing zero to empty_zero_page is more
obviously safe than writing to the paging structures.  (It's
extremely unlikely that any of this would cause problems in practice
because the write will fail on any supported CPU.)
