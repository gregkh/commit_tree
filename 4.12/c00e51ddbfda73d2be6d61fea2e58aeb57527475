net: mpls: Don't show nexthop if device has been deleted

If the device for a nexthop in a multipath route is deleted, the nexthop
is effectively removed from the route. Currently, a route dump still
returns the nexhop though without the device set:

$ ip -f mpls ro ls
100
	nexthopvia inet 10.11.1.2  dev br0
	nexthopvia inet 10.100.3.1  dev eth3
$ ip li del br0
$ ip -f mpls ro ls
100
	nexthopvia inet 10.11.1.2  dev * dead linkdown
	nexthopvia inet 10.100.3.1  dev eth3

Since the nexthop is effectively deleted, drop the hop from the route
dump.
