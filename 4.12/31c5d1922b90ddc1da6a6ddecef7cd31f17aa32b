USB: serial: ftdi_sio: add device ID for Microsemi/Arrow SF2PLUS Dev Kit

This development kit has an FT4232 on it with a custom USB VID/PID.
The FT4232 provides four UARTs, but only two are used. The UART 0
is used by the FlashPro5 programmer and UART 2 is connected to the
SmartFusion2 CortexM3 SoC UART port.

Note that the USB VID is registered to Actel according to Linux USB
VID database, but that was acquired by Microsemi.
