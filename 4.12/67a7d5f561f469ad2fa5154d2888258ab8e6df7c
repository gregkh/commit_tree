ext4: fix fdatasync(2) after extent manipulation operations

Currently, extent manipulation operations such as hole punch, range
zeroing, or extent shifting do not record the fact that file data has
changed and thus fdatasync(2) has a work to do. As a result if we crash
e.g. after a punch hole and fdatasync, user can still possibly see the
punched out data after journal replay. Test generic/392 fails due to
these problems.

Fix the problem by properly marking that file data has changed in these
operations.
