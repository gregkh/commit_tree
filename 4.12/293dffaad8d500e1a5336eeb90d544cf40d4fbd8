libceph: NULL deref on crush_decode() error path

If there is not enough space then ceph_decode_32_safe() does a goto bad.
We need to return an error code in that situation.  The current code
returns ERR_PTR(0) which is NULL.  The callers are not expecting that
and it results in a NULL dereference.
