ftrace: Simplify ftrace_match_record() even more

Dan Carpenter sent a patch to remove a check in ftrace_match_record()
because the logic of the code made the check redundant. I looked deeper into
the code, and made the following logic table, with the three variables and
the result of the original code.

modname        mod_matches     exclude_mod         result
-------        -----------     -----------         ------
  0                 0               0              return 0
  0                 0               1              func_match
  0                 1               *             < cannot exist >
  1                 0               0              return 0
  1                 0               1              func_match
  1                 1               0              func_match
  1                 1               1              return 0

Notice that when mod_matches == exclude mod, the result is always to
return 0, and when mod_matches != exclude_mod, then the result is to test
the function. This means we only need test if mod_matches is equal to
exclude_mod.
