rtlwifi: btcoex: 21a 1ant: avoid LPS/IPS mismatch for pnp notify

When driver is going to sleep, it does not leave LPS/IPS, thus the
BTCoex may have mismatch when driver wakes up. To avoid that, BTCoex
needs to clear the IPS/LPS state when it receives a pnp notify, then
it can properly set up the hw when driver wakes up.
