usb: musb: Fix trying to suspend while active for OTG configurations

Commit d8e5f0eca1e8 ("usb: musb: Fix hardirq-safe hardirq-unsafe
lock order error") caused a regression where musb keeps trying to
enable host mode with no cable connected. This seems to be caused
by the fact that now phy is enabled earlier, and we are wrongly
trying to force USB host mode on an OTG port. The errors we are
getting are "trying to suspend as a_idle while active".

For ports configured as OTG, we should not need to do anything
to try to force USB host mode on it's OTG port. Trying to force host
mode in this case just seems to completely confuse the musb state
machine.

Let's fix the issue by making musb_host_setup() attempt to force the
mode only if port_mode is configured for host mode.
