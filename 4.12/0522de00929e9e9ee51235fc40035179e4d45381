dt-bindings: Add vendor prefix for Motorola

Motorola was involved in semiconductor and mobile phone business.
The "motorola," prefix is already used by a couple of bindings:

* rtc/rtc-cmos.txt
* mfd/motorola-cpcap.txt
* regulator/cpcap-regulator.txt

Apart from that it is used in the DT file for the Droid 4 mobile
phone.
