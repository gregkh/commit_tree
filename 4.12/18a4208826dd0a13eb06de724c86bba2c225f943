imx-serial: Reduce RX DMA startup latency when opening for reading

Reduce RX DMA start latency for the first reception when port is opened
for reading. Instead of waiting for an interrupt signaling data on RX
FIFO or data too old on RX FIFO, start RX DMA immediately when the
serial port is opened for reading.

Before this patch, the average RX DMA latency for the first reception
was 42489 microseconds with a standard deviation of 25721 microseconds
in 36 samples.

After the patch the average RX DMA latency for the first reception, when
the serial port is opened for reading, is 653 microseconds with a
standard deviation of 294 microseconds in 36 samples.
