ovl: check IS_APPEND() on real upper inode

For overlay file open, check IS_APPEND() on the real upper inode
inside d_real(), because the overlay inode does not have the
S_APPEND flag and IS_APPEND() can only be checked at open time.

Note that because overlayfs does not copy up the chattr inode flags
(i.e. S_APPEND, S_IMMUTABLE), the IS_APPEND() check is only relevant
for upper inodes that were set with chattr +a and not to lower
inodes that had chattr +a before copy up.
