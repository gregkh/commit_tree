f2fs: avoid IO split due to mixed WB_SYNC_ALL and WB_SYNC_NONE

If two threads try to flush dirty pages in different inodes respectively,
f2fs_write_data_pages() will produce WRITE and WRITE_SYNC one at a time,
resulting in a lot of 4KB seperated IOs.

So, this patch gives higher priority to WB_SYNC_ALL IOs and gathers write
IOs with a big WRITE_SYNC'ed bio.
