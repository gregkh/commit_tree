KVM: nVMX: fix EPT permissions as reported in exit qualification

This fixes the new ept_access_test_read_only and ept_access_test_read_write
testcases from vmx.flat.

The problem is that gpte_access moves bits around to switch from EPT
bit order (XWR) to ACC_*_MASK bit order (RWX).  This results in an
incorrect exit qualification.  To fix this, make pt_access and
pte_access operate on raw PTE values (only with NX flipped to mean
"can execute") and call gpte_access at the end of the walk.  This
lets us use pte_access to compute the exit qualification with XWR
bit order.
