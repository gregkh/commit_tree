Documentation: devicetree: thermal: da9062/61 TJUNC temperature binding

Device tree binding information for DA9062 and DA9061 thermal junction
temperature monitor.

Binding descriptions for the DA9061 and DA9062 thermal TJUNC supervisor
device driver, using a single THERMAL_TRIP_HOT trip-wire and allowing for
a configurable polling period for over-temperature polling.

This patch also adds two examples, one for DA9062 and one for DA9061. The
DA9061 example uses a fall-back compatible string for the DA9062.
