scsi: cxlflash: Introduce hardware queue steering

As an enhancement to distribute requests to multiple hardware queues, add the
infrastructure to hash a SCSI command into a particular hardware queue.
Support the following scenarios when deriving which queue to use: single
queue, tagging when SCSI-MQ enabled, and simple hash via CPU ID when SCSI-MQ
is disabled. Rather than altering the existing send API, the derived hardware
queue is stored in the AFU command where it can be used for sending a command
to the chosen hardware queue.
