[media] tc358743: put lanes in STOP state before starting streaming

Without calling tc358743_set_csi after stopping streaming (or calling
tc358743_s_dv_timings or tc358743_set_fmt from userspace after stopping
the stream), the i.MX6 MIPI CSI2 input fails waiting for lanes to enter
STOP state when streaming is started again.
