powerpc/book3s: Print the kernel function name in machine check

For D-side errors we print the load/store address that caused the
machine check as 'Effective address'. But the instruction that may have
caused the machine check can also be helpful, so in addition to printing
the NIP, also print the kernel function name as well.

After this patch the MCE console log would look like:

  Severe Machine check interrupt [Recovered]
    NIP [d00000001bc70194]: init_module+0x194/0x2b0 [bork_kernel]
    Initiator: CPU
    Error type: SLB [Parity]
      Effective address: d000000026de0000
