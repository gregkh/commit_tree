dm kcopyd: switch to use REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES

It seems like the code currently passes whatever it was using for writes
to WRITE SAME.  Just switch it to WRITE ZEROES, although that doesn't
need any payload.

Untested, and confused by the code, maybe someone who understands it
better than me can help..
