staging: ks7010: change static function return type

Function has return type 'int'. Function has internal linkage. Function
returns 0 on all execution paths. Function is called only once in the
driver and the return value is not checked. Removal of this return
value does not change the program logic. The 'int' return type is not
adding any information thus it is better to remove it.

Change return type of function with internal linkage from 'int' to
'void'.
