ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix module state after unbind and delete

When DSP module is unbound, the module state needs to be in INIT_DONE
state instead of UNINT. Also the state needs to be set to UNINIT after
module is deleted from DSP pipeline.

So, set the module state to INIT_DONE after unbind and then UNINIT after
module is deleted.
