KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v3: Use PREbits to infer the number of ICH_APxRn_EL2 registers

The GICv3 documentation is extremely confusing, as it talks about
the number of priorities represented by the ICH_APxRn_EL2 registers,
while it should really talk about the number of preemption levels.

This leads to a bug where we may access undefined ICH_APxRn_EL2
registers, since PREbits is allowed to be smaller than PRIbits.
Thankfully, nobody seem to have taken this path so far...

The fix is to use ICH_VTR_EL2.PREbits instead.
