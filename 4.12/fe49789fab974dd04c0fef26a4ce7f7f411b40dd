drm/i915: Deconstruct execute fence

On reflection, we are only using the execute fence as a waitqueue on the
global_seqno and not using it for dependency tracking between fences
(unlike the submit and dma fences). By only treating it as a waitqueue,
we can then treat it similar to the other waitqueues during submit,
making the code simpler.
