net: ipv6: Release route when device is unregistering

Roopa reported attempts to delete a bond device that is referenced in a
multipath route is hanging:

$ ifdown bond2    # ifupdown2 command that deletes virtual devices
unregister_netdevice: waiting for bond2 to become free. Usage count = 2

Steps to reproduce:
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/ignore_routes_with_linkdown
    ip link add dev bond12 type bond
    ip link add dev bond13 type bond
    ip addr add 2001:db8:2::0/64 dev bond12
    ip addr add 2001:db8:3::0/64 dev bond13
    ip route add 2001:db8:33::0/64 nexthop via 2001:db8:2::2 nexthop via 2001:db8:3::2
    ip link del dev bond12
    ip link del dev bond13

The root cause is the recent change to keep routes on a linkdown. Update
the check to detect when the device is unregistering and release the
route for that case.
