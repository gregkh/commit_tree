mlx4: remove duplicate code in mlx4_en_process_rx_cq()

We should keep one way to build skbs, regardless of GRO being on or off.

Note that I made sure to defer as much as possible the point we need to
pull data from the frame, so that future prefetch() we might add
are more effective.

These skb attributes derive from the CQE or ring :
 ip_summed, csum
 hash
 vlan offload
 hwtstamps
 queue_mapping

As a bonus, this patch removes mlx4 dependency on eth_get_headlen()
which is very often broken enough to give us headaches.
