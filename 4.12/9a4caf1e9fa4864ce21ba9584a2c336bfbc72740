mm: memcontrol: provide shmem statistics

Cgroups currently don't report how much shmem they use, which can be
useful data to have, in particular since shmem is included in the
cache/file item while being reclaimed like anonymous memory.

Add a counter to track shmem pages during charging and uncharging.
