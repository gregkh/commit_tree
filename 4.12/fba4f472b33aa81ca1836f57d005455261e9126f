x86/reboot: Turn off KVM when halting a CPU

A CPU in VMX root mode will ignore INIT signals and will fail to bring
up the APs after reboot.  Therefore, on a panic we disable VMX on all
CPUs before rebooting or triggering kdump.

Do this when halting the machine as well, in case a firmware-level reboot
does not perform a cold reset for all processors.  Without doing this,
rebooting the host may hang.
