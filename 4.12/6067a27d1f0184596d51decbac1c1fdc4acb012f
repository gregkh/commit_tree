drm/i915: Avoid tweaking evaluation thresholds on Baytrail v3

Certain Baytrails, namely the 4 cpu core variants, have been
plaqued by spurious system hangs, mostly occurring with light loads.

Multiple bisects by various people point to a commit which changes the
reclocking strategy for Baytrail to follow its bigger brethen:
commit 8fb55197e64d ("drm/i915: Agressive downclocking on Baytrail")

There is also a review comment attached to this commit from Deepak S
on avoiding punit access on Cherryview and thus it was excluded on
common reclocking path. By taking the same approach and omitting
the punit access by not tweaking the thresholds when the hardware
has been asked to move into different frequency, considerable gains
in stability have been observed.

With J1900 box, light render/video load would end up in system hang
in usually less than 12 hours. With this patch applied, the cumulative
uptime has now been 34 days without issues. To provoke system hang,
light loads on both render and bsd engines in parallel have been used:
glxgears >/dev/null 2>/dev/null &
mpv --vo=vaapi --hwdec=vaapi --loop=inf vid.mp4

So far, author has not witnessed system hang with above load
and this patch applied. Reports from the tenacious people at
kernel bugzilla are also promising.

Considering that the punit access frequency with this patch is
considerably less, there is a possibility that this will push
the, still unknown, root cause past the triggering point on most loads.

But as we now can reliably reproduce the hang independently,
we can reduce the pain that users are having and use a
static thresholds until a root cause is found.
