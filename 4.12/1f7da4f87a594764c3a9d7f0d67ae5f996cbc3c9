usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix ExtCompat documentation in uapi header

The code was fixed in
commit 53642399aa71 ("usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix wrong check on reserved1 wof OS_DESC_EXT_COMPAT")
but the in-header documentation kept referencing 0 as the expected value.
Reference 1 instead as per original commit message.
