vfio/powerpc/spapr_tce: Enforce IOMMU type compatibility check

The existing SPAPR TCE driver advertises both VFIO_SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU and
VFIO_SPAPR_TCE_v2_IOMMU types to the userspace and the userspace usually
picks the v2.

Normally the userspace would create a container, attach an IOMMU group
to it and only then set the IOMMU type (which would normally be v2).

However a specific IOMMU group may not support v2, in other words
it may not implement set_window/unset_window/take_ownership/
release_ownership and such a group should not be attached to
a v2 container.

This adds extra checks that a new group can do what the selected IOMMU
type suggests. The userspace can then test the return value from
ioctl(VFIO_SET_IOMMU, VFIO_SPAPR_TCE_v2_IOMMU) and try
VFIO_SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU.
