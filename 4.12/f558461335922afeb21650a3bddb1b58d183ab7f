[media] saa7134: constify nxt200x_config structures

Declare nxt200x_config structures as const as they are only passed as
an argument to the function dvb_attach. dvb_attach calls its first
argument on the rest of its arguments. The first argument of
dvb_attach in the changed cases is nxt200x_attach and the parameter of
this function to which the object references are passed is of type
const. So, nxt200x_config structures having this property can be made
const.
