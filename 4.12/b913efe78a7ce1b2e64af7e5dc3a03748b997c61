arm64: dma-mapping: Remove the notifier trick to handle early setting of dma_ops

With arch_setup_dma_ops now being called late during device's probe after
the device's iommu is probed, the notifier trick required to handle the
early setup of dma_ops before the iommu group gets created is not
required. So removing the notifier's here.
