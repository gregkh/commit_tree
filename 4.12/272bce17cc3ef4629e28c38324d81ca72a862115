drm/i915: split out check for noncontiguous pfn range

We get a warning with gcc-7 about a pointless comparison when
using a linear memmap:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/selftests/scatterlist.c: In function 'alloc_table':
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/selftests/scatterlist.c:219:66: error: self-comparison always evaluates to false [-Werror=tautological-compare]

Splitting out the comparison into a separate function avoids the warning
and makes it slightly more obvious what happens.
