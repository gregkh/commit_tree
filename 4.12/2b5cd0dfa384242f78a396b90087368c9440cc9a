net: Change return type of sk_busy_loop from bool to void

checking the return value of sk_busy_loop. As there are only a few
consumers of that data, and the data being checked for can be replaced
with a check for !skb_queue_empty() we might as well just pull the code
out of sk_busy_loop and place it in the spots that actually need it.
