blk-throttle: respect 0 bps/iops settings for io.low

If a cgroup with low limit 0 for both bps/iops, the cgroup's low limit
is ignored and we throttle the cgroup with its max limit. In this way,
other cgroups with a low limit will not get protected. To fix this, we
don't do the exception any more. cgroup will be throttled to a limit 0
if it uese default setting. To avoid completed stall, we give such
cgroup tiny IO resources.
