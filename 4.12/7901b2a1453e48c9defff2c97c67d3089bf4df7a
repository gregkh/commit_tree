staging:iio:adc:lpc32xx rename local state structure to _state

Previously it was called _info with instances as info.  This caused some
confusion against the info structure that are used in the core of IIO.

Since this driver was written it's become a fairly strong convention to
use _state and st for instances so change to that.
