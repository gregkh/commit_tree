net: mpls: bump maximum number of labels

Allow users to push down more labels per MPLS route. With the previous
patches, no memory allocations are based on MAX_NEW_LABELS; the limit
is only used to keep userspace in check.

At this point MAX_NEW_LABELS is only used for mpls_route_config (copying
route data from userspace) and processing nexthops looking for the max
number of labels across the route spec.
