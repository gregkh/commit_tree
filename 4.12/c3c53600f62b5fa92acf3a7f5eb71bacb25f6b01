doc: Explain light-handed markup preference a bit better

We're still pretty far away from anything like a consensus, but
there's clearly a lot of people who prefer an as-light as possible
approach to converting existing .txt files to .rst. Make sure this is
properly taken into account and clear.

Motivated by discussions with Peter and Christoph and others.
