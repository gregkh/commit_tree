drm/i915: Report both waiters and success from intel_engine_wakeup()

The two users of the return value from intel_engine_wakeup() are
expecting different results. In the breadcrumbs hangcheck, we are using
it to determine whether wake_up_process() detected the waiter was
currently running (and if so we presume that it hasn't yet missed the
interrupt). However, in the fake_irq path, we are using the return value
as a check as to whether there are any waiters, and so we may
incorrectly stop the fake-irq if that waiter was currently running.

To handle the two different needs, return both bits of information! We
uninline it from the irq path in preparation for the next patch which
makes the irq hotpath special and relegates intel_engine_wakeup() to the
slow fixup paths.

v2: s/ret/result/
