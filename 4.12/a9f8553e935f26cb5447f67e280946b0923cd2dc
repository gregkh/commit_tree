powerpc/kprobes: Pause function_graph tracing during jprobes handling

This fixes a crash when function_graph and jprobes are used together.
This is essentially commit 237d28db036e ("ftrace/jprobes/x86: Fix
conflict between jprobes and function graph tracing"), but for powerpc.

Jprobes breaks function_graph tracing since the jprobe hook needs to use
jprobe_return(), which never returns back to the hook, but instead to
the original jprobe'd function. The solution is to momentarily pause
function_graph tracing before invoking the jprobe hook and re-enable it
when returning back to the original jprobe'd function.
