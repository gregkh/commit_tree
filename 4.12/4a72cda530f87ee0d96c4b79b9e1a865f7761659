nvmem: sunxi-sid: read NVMEM size from device compatible

Sometimes the SID device have more memory address space than the real
NVMEM size (for the registers used to read/write the SID).

Fetch the NVMEM size from device compatible, rather than the memory
address space's length, in order to prepare for adding some
registers-based read support.
