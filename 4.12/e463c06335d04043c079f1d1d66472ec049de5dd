usb/URB.txt: convert to ReST and update it

The URB doc describes the Kernel mechanism that do USB transfers.
While the functions are already described at urb.h, there are a
number of concepts and theory that are important for USB driver
developers.

Convert it to ReST and use C ref links to point to the places
at usb.h where each function and struct is located.

A few of those descriptions were incomplete. While here, update
to reflect the current API status.
