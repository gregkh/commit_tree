ALSA: fireface: add model specific structure

RME Fireface series has several models and their specifications are
different. Currently, we find no way to retrieve the specifications
from actual devices and need to implement them in this driver.

This commit adds a structure to describe model specific data. This
structure has an identical name for each unit, and maximum number of
data channels in each mode. I'll describe about the mode in following
commits.
