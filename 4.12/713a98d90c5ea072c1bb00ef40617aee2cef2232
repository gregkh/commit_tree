virtio-net: serialize tx routine during reset

We don't hold any tx lock when trying to disable TX during reset, this
would lead a use after free since ndo_start_xmit() tries to access
the virtqueue which has already been freed. Fix this by using
netif_tx_disable() before freeing the vqs, this could make sure no tx
after vq freeing.
