clk: sunxi-ng: Fix round_rate/set_rate multiplier minimum mismatch

In commit 2beaa601c849 ("clk: sunxi-ng: Implement minimum for
multipliers"), the multiplier minimums in the set_rate callback
for NM and NKMP style clocks were not updated.

This patch fixes them to match their round_rate callbacks.
