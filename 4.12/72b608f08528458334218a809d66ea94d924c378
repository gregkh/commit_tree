ovl: constant st_ino/st_dev across copy up

When all layers are on the same underlying filesystem, let stat(2) return
st_dev/st_ino values of the copy up origin inode if it is known.

This results in constant st_ino/st_dev representation of files in an
overlay mount before and after copy up.

When the underlying filesystem support NFS exportfs, the result is also
persistent st_ino/st_dev representation before and after mount cycle.

Lower hardlinks are broken on copy up to different upper files, so we
cannot use the lower origin st_ino for those different files, even for the
same fs case.

When all overlay layers are on the same fs, use overlay st_dev for non-dirs
to get the correct result from du -x.
