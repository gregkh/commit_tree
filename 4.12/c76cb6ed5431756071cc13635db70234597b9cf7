i40e: Drop FCoE code that always evaluates to false or 0

Since FCoE isn't supported by the i40e products there isn't much point in
carrying around code that will always evaluate to false. This patch goes
through and strips out the code in several spots so that we don't go around
carrying variables and/or code that is always going to evaluate to false or
0.
