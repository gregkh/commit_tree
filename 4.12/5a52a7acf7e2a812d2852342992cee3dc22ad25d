IB/hfi1: NULL pointer dereference when freeing rhashtable

A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the driver
is unloaded, and the SDMA rhashtable is freed if
the rhashtable_init() function has not been called.
Prevent this by changing sdma_rht to be a pointer
to a dynamically allocated hash table. The NULL-ness
of the pointer serves as an indication that the hash
table was initialized and that it needs to be
destroyed.
