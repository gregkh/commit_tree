nfp: pass new data path to ring reconfig

Make callers of nfp_net_ring_reconfig() pass newly allocated data
path structure.  We will gradually make use of that structure
instead of passing parameters around to all the allocation functions.
This commit adds allocation and propagation of new data path struct,
no parameters are converted, yet.
