drm/radeon: remove useless and potentially wrong message

There is no need to repeat information that printed by PCI core at boot time.

Besides that printing was potentially wrong since resource_size_t might be
bigger than 32 bits and there is a dedicated specifier for such type, i.e.
%pap. Someone can fix it and use even better approach, i.e. %pR.
