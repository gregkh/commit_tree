KEYS: Add an optional lookup_restriction hook to key_type

The restrict_link functions used to validate keys as they are linked
to a keyring can be associated with specific key types.  Each key type
may be loaded (or not) at runtime, so lookup of restrict_link
functions needs to be part of the key type implementation to ensure
that the requested keys can be examined.
