drm/i915: Park the signaler before sleeping

If the signal to park arrives before we sleep, then we need to check
kthread_should_park() before sleeping to avoid missing the signal.
Otherwise, if the signal arrives whilst we are processing completed
requests, we will reset the current->state back to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
and so miss the wakeup.
