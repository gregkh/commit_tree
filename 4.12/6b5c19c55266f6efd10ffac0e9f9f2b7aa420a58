powerpc/mmu: Add real mode support for IOMMU preregistered memory

This makes mm_iommu_lookup() able to work in realmode by replacing
list_for_each_entry_rcu() (which can do debug stuff which can fail in
real mode) with list_for_each_entry_lockless().

This adds realmode version of mm_iommu_ua_to_hpa() which adds
explicit vmalloc'd-to-linear address conversion.
Unlike mm_iommu_ua_to_hpa(), mm_iommu_ua_to_hpa_rm() can fail.

This changes mm_iommu_preregistered() to receive @mm as in real mode
@current does not always have a correct pointer.

This adds realmode version of mm_iommu_lookup() which receives @mm
(for the same reason as for mm_iommu_preregistered()) and uses
lockless version of list_for_each_entry_rcu().
