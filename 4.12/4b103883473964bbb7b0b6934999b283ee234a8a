PCI: Don't attempt config access to disconnected devices

If we've  detected the PCI device is disconnected, there is no need to
attempt to access its config space since we know the operation will fail.
Make all the config reads and writes return -ENODEV error immediately when
in such a state.

If a caller requests a config read to a disconnected device, return a data
value of all 1's.  This is the same as what hardware is expected to return
when accessing a removed device, but software can do this faster without
relying on hardware.
