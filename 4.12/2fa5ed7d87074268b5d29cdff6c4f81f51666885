s390/mm: Remove double gaddr calculation when notifying

ptep_notify and gmap_shadow_notify both need a guest address and
therefore retrieve them from the available virtual host address.

As they operate on the same guest address, we can calculate it once
and then pass it on. As a gmap normally has more than one shadow gmap,
we also do not recalculate for each of them any more.
