srcu: Push srcu_advance_batches() fastpath into common case

This commit simplifies the SRCU state machine by pushing the
srcu_advance_batches() idle-SRCU fastpath into the common case.  This is
done by giving srcu_reschedule() a delay parameter, which is zero in
the call from srcu_advance_batches().

This commit is a step towards numbering callbacks in order to
efficiently handle per-CPU callback lists.
