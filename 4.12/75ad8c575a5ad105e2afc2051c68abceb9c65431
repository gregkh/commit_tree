checkpatch: add --typedefsfile

When using checkpatch on out-of-tree code, it may occur that some
project-specific types are used, which will cause spurious warnings.
Add the --typedefsfile option as a way to extend the known types and
deal with this issue.

This was developed for OP-TEE [1].  We run a Travis job on all pull
requests [2], and checkpatch is part of that.  The typical false warning
we get on a regular basis is with some pointers to functions returning
TEE_Result [3], which is a typedef from the GlobalPlatform APIs.  We
consider it is acceptable to use GP types in the OP-TEE core
implementation, that's why this patch would be helpful for us.
