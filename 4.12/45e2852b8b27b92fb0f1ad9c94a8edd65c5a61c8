staging: iio: isl29028: fix incorrect sleep time when taking initial proximity reading

When proximity is enabled in isl29028_enable_proximity(), the function
msleep() is called with the sampling frequency, which is not correct.
This patch changes the code to sleep the specified amount of time listed
in the datasheet instead.
