KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v2: Do not use Active+Pending state for a HW interrupt

When an interrupt is injected with the HW bit set (indicating that
deactivation should be propagated to the physical distributor),
special care must be taken so that we never mark the corresponding
LR with the Active+Pending state (as the pending state is kept in
the physycal distributor).
