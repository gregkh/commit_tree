ASoC: intel: Don't print FW version repeatedly

Intel SST driver spews an info message "FW Versoin xxxx" at each time
the device gets initialized.  Since it's triggered at each PM (or even
runtime PM), it appears so ofetn, and rather becomes annoying than
useful.

This patch suppresses the superfluous messages by checking the
currently loaded FW version with the previously loaded one.
