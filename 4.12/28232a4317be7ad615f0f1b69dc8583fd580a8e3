KVM: arm/arm64: Fix isues with GICv2 on GICv3 migration

We have been a little loose with our intermediate VMCR representation
where we had a 'ctlr' field, but we failed to differentiate between the
GICv2 GICC_CTLR and ICC_CTLR_EL1 layouts, and therefore ended up mapping
the wrong bits into the individual fields of the ICH_VMCR_EL2 when
emulating a GICv2 on a GICv3 system.

Fix this by using explicit fields for the VMCR bits instead.
