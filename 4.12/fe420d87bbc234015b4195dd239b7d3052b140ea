net/core: remove explicit do_softirq() from busy_poll_stop()

Since commit 217f69743681 ("net: busy-poll: allow preemption in
sk_busy_loop()") there is an explicit do_softirq() invocation after
local_bh_enable() has been invoked.
I don't understand why we need this because local_bh_enable() will
invoke do_softirq() once the softirq counter reached zero and we have
softirq-related work pending.
