dm cache: handle kmalloc failure allocating background_tracker struct

Currently there is no kmalloc failure check on the allocation of
the background_tracker struct in btracker_create(), and so a NULL return
will lead to a NULL pointer dereference.  Add a NULL check.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1416587 ("Dereference null return value")
