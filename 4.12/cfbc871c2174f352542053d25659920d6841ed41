igb: Limit maximum frame Rx based on MTU

In order to support the use of build_skb going forward it will be necessary
to place a maximum limit on the amount of data we can receive when jumbo
frames is not enabled.  In order to do this I am adding a new upper limit
for receive based on the size of a 2K buffer minus padding.
