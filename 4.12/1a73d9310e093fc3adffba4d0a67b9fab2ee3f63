MIPS: Fix bnezc/jialc return address calculation

The code handling the pop76 opcode (ie. bnezc & jialc instructions) in
__compute_return_epc_for_insn() needs to set the value of $31 in the
jialc case, which is encoded with rs = 0. However its check to
differentiate bnezc (rs != 0) from jialc (rs = 0) was unfortunately
backwards, meaning that if we emulate a bnezc instruction we clobber $31
& if we emulate a jialc instruction it actually behaves like a jic
instruction.

Fix this by inverting the check of rs to match the way the instructions
are actually encoded.
