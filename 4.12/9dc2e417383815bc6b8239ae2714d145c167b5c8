i40e: split some code in i40e_reset_vf into helpers

A future patch is going to want to re-use some of the code in
i40e_reset_vf, so lets break up the beginning and ending parts into
their own helper functions. The first function will be used to
initialize the reset on a VF, while the second function will be used to
finalize the reset and restore functionality.
