mlx4: use order-0 pages for RX

Use of order-3 pages is problematic in some cases.

This patch might add three kinds of regression :

1) a CPU performance regression, but we will add later page
recycling and performance should be back.

2) TCP receiver could grow its receive window slightly slower,
   because skb->len/skb->truesize ratio will decrease.
   This is mostly ok, we prefer being conservative to not risk OOM,
   and eventually tune TCP better in the future.
   This is consistent with other drivers using 2048 per ethernet frame.

3) Because we allocate one page per RX slot, we consume more
   memory for the ring buffers. XDP already had this constraint anyway.
