net: systemport: Fix missing Wake-on-LAN interrupt for SYSTEMPORT Lite

On SYSTEMPORT Lite, since we have the main interrupt source in the first
cell, the second cell is the Wake-on-LAN interrupt, yet the code was not
properly updated to fetch the second cell, and instead looked at the
third and non-existing cell for Wake-on-LAN.
