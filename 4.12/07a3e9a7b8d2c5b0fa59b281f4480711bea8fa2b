KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Check the device id matches TYPER DEVBITS range

On MAPD we currently check the device id can be stored in the device table.
Let's first check it can be encoded within the range defined by TYPER
DEVBITS.

Also check the collection ID belongs to the 16 bit range as GITS_TYPER
CIL field equals to 0.
