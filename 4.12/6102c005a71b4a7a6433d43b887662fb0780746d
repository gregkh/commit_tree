powerpc/64s: Fix unnecessary machine check handler relocation branch

Similarly to commit 2563a70c3b ("powerpc/64s: Remove unnecessary relocation
branch from idle handler"), the machine check handler has a BRANCH_TO from
relocated to relocated code, which is unnecessary.

It has also caused build errors with some toolchains:

  arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S: Assembler messages:
  arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S:395: Error: operand out of range
  (0xffffffffffff8280 is not between 0x0000000000000000 and
  0x000000000000ffff)
