mac80211: Fix possible sband related NULL pointer de-reference

Existing API 'ieee80211_get_sdata_band' returns default 2 GHz band even
if the channel context configuration is NULL. This crashes for chipsets
which support 5 Ghz alone when it tries to access members of 'sband'.
Channel context configuration can be NULL in multivif case and when
channel switch is in progress (or) when it fails. Fix this by replacing
the API 'ieee80211_get_sdata_band' with  'ieee80211_get_sband' which
returns a NULL pointer for sband when the channel configuration is NULL.

An example scenario is as below:

In multivif mode (AP + STA) with drivers like ath10k, when we do a
channel switch in the AP vif (which has a number of clients connected)
and a STA vif which is connected to some other AP, when the channel
switch in AP vif fails, while the STA vifs tries to connect to the
other AP, there is a window where the channel context is NULL/invalid
and this results in a crash  while the clients connected to the AP vif
tries to reconnect and this race is very similar to the one investigated
by Michal in https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/3788161/ and this does
happens with hardware that supports 5Ghz alone after long hours of
testing with continuous channel switch on the AP vif
