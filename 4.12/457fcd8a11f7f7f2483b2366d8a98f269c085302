net/mlx5e: Set default RX moderation parameters on driver load

RX moderation default parameters shouldn't be set in
mlx5e_build_rx_cq_param since it would reset the values every time on
netdev open/close.  Instead, it should be set in
mlx5e_set_rx_cq_mode_params which is called on driver load only.
