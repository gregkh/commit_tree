dmaengine: rcar-dmac: enable descriptor mode on 40bit

SYS-DMAC can use 40bit address transfer, and it supports Descriptor
Mode too. Current SYS-DMAC driver disables Descriptor Mode if it was
40bit address today. But it can use Descriptor Mode with 40bit if
transfer Source/Destination address are located in same 4GiB region
in the 40 bit address space.
This patch enables it if all condition was clear
