drm/atomic: Add new iterators over all state, v3.

Add for_each_(old)(new)_(plane,connector,crtc)_in_state iterators to
replace the old for_each_xxx_in_state ones. This is useful for >1 flip
depth and getting rid of all xxx->state dereferences.

This requires extra fixups done when committing a state after
duplicating, which in general isn't valid but is used by suspend/resume.
To handle these, introduce drm_atomic_helper_commit_duplicated_state
which performs those fixups before checking & committing the state.

Changes since v1:
- Remove nonblock parameter for commit_duplicated_state.
Changes since v2:
- Use commit_duplicated_state for i915 load detection.
- Add WARN_ON(old_state != obj->state) before swapping.
