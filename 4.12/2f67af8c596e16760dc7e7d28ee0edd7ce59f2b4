qed: Pass src/dst sizes when interacting with MFW

The driver interaction with management firmware involves a union
of all the data-members relating to the commands the driver prepares.

Current interface assumes the caller always passes such a union -
but thats cumbersome as well as risky [chancing a stack corruption
in case caller accidentally passes a smaller member instead of union].

Change implementation so that caller could pass a pointer to any
of the members instead of the union.
