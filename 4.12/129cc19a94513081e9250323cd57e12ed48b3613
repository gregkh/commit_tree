vfio: ccw: improve error handling for vfio_ccw_mdev_remove

When vfio_ccw_mdev_reset fails during the remove process of the mdev,
the current implementation simply returns.

The failure indicates that the subchannel device is in a NOT_OPER state,
thus the right thing to do should be removing the mdev.

While we are at here, reverse the condition check to make the code more
concise and readable.
