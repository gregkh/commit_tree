clocksource: em_sti: Compute rate before registration

With the upcoming NTP correction related rate adjustments to be implemented
in the clockevents core, the latter needs to get informed about every rate
change of a clockevent device made after its registration.

Currently, em_sti violates this requirement in that it registers its
clockevent device with a dummy rate and sets its final rate through
clockevents_config() called from its ->set_state_oneshot().

This patch moves the setting of the clockevent device's rate to its
registration.

I checked all current em_sti users in arch/arm/mach-shmobile and right now,
none of them changes any rate in any clock tree relevant to em_sti after
their respective time_init(). Since all em_sti instances are created after
time_init(), none of them should ever observe any clock rate changes.

- Determine the ->rate value in em_sti_probe() at device probing rather
  than at first usage.
- Set the clockevent device's rate at its registration.
- Although not strictly necessary for the upcoming clockevent core changes,
  set the clocksource's rate at its registration for consistency.
