ARM: dts: uniphier: move memory node below aliases node

These UniPhier DT files are fine as long as they are compiled in the
Linux build system.  It is true that Linux is the biggest user of
DT, but DT is project neutral from its concept.  DT files are often
re-used for other projects.  Especially for the UniPhier platform,
these DT files are re-used for U-Boot as well.

If I feed these DT files to the FDTGREP tool in U-Boot, it complains
about the node order.

  FDTGREP spl/u-boot-spl.dtb
  Error at 'fdt_find_regions': FDT_ERR_BADLAYOUT
  /aliases node must come before all other nodes

Given that DT is not very sensitive to the order of nodes, this is a
problem of FDTGREP.  I filed a bug report a year ago, but it has not
been fixed yet.

Differentiating DT is painful.  So, I am up-streaming the requirement
from the down-stream project.
