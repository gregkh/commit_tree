mfd: syscon: atmel-smc: Add new helpers to ease SMC regs manipulation

These new helpers + macro definitions are meant to replace the old ones
which are unpractical to use.

Note that the macros and function prefixes have been intentionally
changed to ATMEL_[H]SMC_XX and atmel_[h]smc_ to reflect the fact that
this IP is also embedded in avr32 SoCs (and not only in at91 ones).
