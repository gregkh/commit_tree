ARM: dts: imx6qp-sabresd: Set reg_arm regulator supply

On imx6qp-sabresd LDO_ARM is connected to a different PMIC output than
the other imx6qdl-sabresd boards.

Setting cpu0 arm-supply to sw2_reg is wrong, this must have mistakenly
slipped out of the vendor tree where this is are used for LDO bypass.
