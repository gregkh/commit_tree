drm: bridge: lvds-encoder: Add thine,thc63lvdm83d compatible string

The THC63LVDM83D is a transparent LVDS encoder. Unlike dumb LVDS
encoders it can be controlled through a few pins (power down, LVDS
swing, clock edge selection) and requires power supplies. However, on
several boards where the device is used neither the control pins nor the
power supply are controllable.

To avoid developing a separate device-specific driver add a
"thine,thc63lvdm83d" compatible entry to the lvds-encoder driver. This
will allow supporting many THC63LVDM83D-based boards easily, while
allowing future development of an thc63lvdm83d driver when needed
without breaking backward compatibility.
