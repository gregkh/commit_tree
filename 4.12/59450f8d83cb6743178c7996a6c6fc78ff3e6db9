net/tcp_fastopen: Remove mss check in tcp_write_timeout()

Christoph Paasch from Apple found another firewall issue for TFO:
After successful 3WHS using TFO, server and client starts to exchange
data. Afterwards, a 10s idle time occurs on this connection. After that,
firewall starts to drop every packet on this connection.

The fix for this issue is to extend existing firewall blackhole detection
logic in tcp_write_timeout() by removing the mss check.
