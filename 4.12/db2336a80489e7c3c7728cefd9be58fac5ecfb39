KVM: x86: virtualize cpuid faulting

Hardware support for faulting on the cpuid instruction is not required to
emulate it, because cpuid triggers a VM exit anyways. KVM handles the relevant
MSRs (MSR_PLATFORM_INFO and MSR_MISC_FEATURES_ENABLE) and upon a
cpuid-induced VM exit checks the cpuid faulting state and the CPL.
kvm_require_cpl is even kind enough to inject the GP fault for us.
