cfq-iosched: fix the delay of cfq_group's vdisktime under iops mode

When adding a cfq_group into the cfq service tree, we use CFQ_IDLE_DELAY
as the delay of cfq_group's vdisktime if there have been other cfq_groups
already.

When cfq is under iops mode, commit 9a7f38c42c2b ("cfq-iosched: Convert
from jiffies to nanoseconds") could result in a large iops delay and
lead to an abnormal io schedule delay for the added cfq_group. To fix
it, we just need to revert to the old CFQ_IDLE_DELAY value: HZ / 5
when iops mode is enabled.

Despite having the same value, the delay of a cfq_queue in idle class
and the delay of cfq_group are different things, so I define two new
macros for the delay of a cfq_group under time-slice mode and iops mode.
