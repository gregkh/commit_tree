crypto: testmgr - replace compression known answer test

Compression implementations might return valid outputs that
do not match what specified in the test vectors.
For this reason, the testmgr might report that a compression
implementation failed the test even if the data produced
by the compressor is correct.
This implements a decompress-and-verify test for acomp
compression tests rather than a known answer test.
