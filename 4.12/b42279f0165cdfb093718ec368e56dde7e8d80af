powerpc/mm/nohash: MM_SLICE is only used by book3s 64

BOOKE code is dead code as per the Kconfig details. So make it simpler
by enabling MM_SLICE only for book3s_64. The changes w.r.t nohash is just
removing deadcode. W.r.t ppc64, 4k without hugetlb will now enable MM_SLICE.
But that is good, because we reduce one extra variant which probably is not
getting tested much.
