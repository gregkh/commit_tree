iwlwifi: pcie: print less data upon firmware crash

We don't need to print so much data in the kernel log.
Limit the data to be printed to the queue that actually
got stuck in case of a TFD queue hang, and stop dumping
all the CSR and FH registers. Over the course of time, the
CSR and FH values haven't proven themselves to be really
useful for debugging, and they are now in the firmware dump
anyway.

This comes as a preparation to the addition of more data
required to be printed by the firwmare team.
