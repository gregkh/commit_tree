staging: ks7010: remove multi-way decision

Function uses multi-way decision for control flow. Final statement of
function is spin_unlock(). Code can be simplified by adding a goto label
labelling the call to spin_unlock() and jumping to label instead of
using multi-way decision. This allows the code to be indented one
level less which adds to the readability.

Add goto label. Remove multi-way decision by jumping to label. Reduce
indentation in subsequent code. Do not change program logic.
