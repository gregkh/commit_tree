sfc: don't insert mc_list on low-latency firmware if it's too long

If the mc_list is longer than 256 addresses, we enter mc_promisc mode.
If we're in mc_promisc mode and the firmware doesn't support cascaded
 multicast, normally we also insert our mc_list, to prevent stealing by
 another VI.  However, if the mc_list was too long, this isn't really
 helpful - the MC groups that didn't fit in the list can still get
 stolen, and having only some of them stealable will probably cause
 more confusing behaviour than having them all stealable.  Since
 inserting 256 multicast filters takes a long time and can lead to MCDI
 state machine timeouts, just skip the mc_list insert in this overflow
 condition.
