arm64: pmuv3: handle pmuv3+

Commit f1b36dcb5c316c27 ("arm64: pmuv3: handle !PMUv3 when probing") is
a little too restrictive, and prevents the use of of backwards
compatible PMUv3 extenstions, which have a PMUver value other than 1.

For instance, ARMv8.1 PMU extensions (as implemented by ThunderX2) are
reported with PMUver value 4.

Per the usual ID register principles, at least 0x1-0x7 imply a
PMUv3-compatible PMU. It's not currently clear whether 0x8-0xe imply the
same.

For the time being, treat the value as signed, and with 0x1-0x7 treated
as meaning PMUv3 is implemented. This may be relaxed by future patches.
