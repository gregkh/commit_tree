kvm: nVMX: Remove superfluous VMX instruction fault checks

According to the Intel SDM, "Certain exceptions have priority over VM
exits. These include invalid-opcode exceptions, faults based on
privilege level*, and general-protection exceptions that are based on
checking I/O permission bits in the task-state segment (TSS)."

There is no need to check for faulting conditions that the hardware
has already checked.

* These include faults generated by attempts to execute, in
  virtual-8086 mode, privileged instructions that are not recognized
  in that mode.
