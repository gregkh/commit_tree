KVM: arm/arm64: Move shared files to virt/kvm/arm

For some time now we have been having a lot of shared functionality
between the arm and arm64 KVM support in arch/arm, which not only
required a horrible inter-arch reference from the Makefile in
arch/arm64/kvm, but also created confusion for newcomers to the code
base, as was recently seen on the mailing list.

Further, it causes confusion for things like cscope, which needs special
attention to index specific shared files for arm64 from the arm tree.

Move the shared files into virt/kvm/arm and move the trace points along
with it.  When moving the tracepoints we have to modify the way the vgic
creates definitions of the trace points, so we take the chance to
include the VGIC tracepoints in its very own special vgic trace.h file.
