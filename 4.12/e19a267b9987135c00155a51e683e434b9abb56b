HID: sony: DS3 comply to Linux gamepad spec

The axis and button mapping for the DS3 is strange. This is mostly
due to the device reporting many axes as for every digital button
it also has an analog button. Due to amount of analog values it
is even leaking well into the MT axes range.

We felt it is best to remove the many analog buttons and just report
digital and comply to the Linux gamepad spec. The analog buttons are
rarely used on the official platform, let alone on Linux.

This patch does remove motion sensor support (added back in another
patch).
