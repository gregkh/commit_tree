perf stat: Fix bug in handling events in error state

(This is a patch has been sitting in the Intel CQM/CMT driver series for
 a while, despite not depend on it. Sending it now independently since
 the series is being discarded.)

When an event is in error state, read() returns 0 instead of sizeof()
buffer. In certain modes, such as interval printing, ignoring the 0
return value may cause bogus count deltas to be computed and thus
invalid results printed.

This patch fixes this problem by modifying read_counters() to mark the
event as not scaled (scaled = -1) to force the printout routine to show
<NOT COUNTED>.
