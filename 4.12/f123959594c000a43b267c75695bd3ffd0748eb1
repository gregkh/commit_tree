    drm/i915/lspcon: Add workaround for resuming in PCON mode

The workaround was added without considering that HPD is low during
the failed AUX transfers the WA fixed. Since the previous patch we
wait for HPD to get asserted. My tests also show that this happens
_after_ the DPCD reads start to return correct values. This
suggests that we don't need this WA any more, let's try to remove
it to reduce the clutter.
