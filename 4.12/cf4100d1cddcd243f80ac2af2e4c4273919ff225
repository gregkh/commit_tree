Revert "ARCv2: Allow enabling PAE40 w/o HIGHMEM"

This reverts commit 7cab91b87dd8eeee5911ec34be8bb0288ebba18b.

Now when we have a real hardware platform with PAE40 enabled
(here I mean axs103 with firmware v1.2) and 1 Gb of DDR mapped to
0x1_a000_0000-0x1_ffff_ffff we're really targeting memory above 4Gb
when PAE40 is enabled. This in its turn requires HIGHMEM to be enabled
otherwise user won't see any difference with enabling PAE in
kernel configuration as only lowmem will be used anyways.
