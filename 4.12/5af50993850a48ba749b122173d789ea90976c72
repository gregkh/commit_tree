KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Native usage of the XIVE interrupt controller

This patch makes KVM capable of using the XIVE interrupt controller
to provide the standard PAPR "XICS" style hypercalls. It is necessary
for proper operations when the host uses XIVE natively.

This has been lightly tested on an actual system, including PCI
pass-through with a TG3 device.
