md: superblock changes for PPL

Include information about PPL location and size into mdp_superblock_1
and copy it to/from rdev. Because PPL is mutually exclusive with bitmap,
put it in place of 'bitmap_offset'. Add a new flag MD_FEATURE_PPL for
'feature_map', analogically to MD_FEATURE_BITMAP_OFFSET. Add MD_HAS_PPL
to mddev->flags to indicate that PPL is enabled on an array.
