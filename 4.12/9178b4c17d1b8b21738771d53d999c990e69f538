samples/bpf: export map_data[] for more info on maps

Giving *_user.c side tools access to map_data[] provides easier
access to information on the maps being loaded.  Still provide
the guarantee that the order maps are being defined in inside the
_kern.c file corresponds with the order in the array.  Now user
tools are not blind, but can inspect and verify the maps that got
loaded from the ELF binary.
