drm/i915: Always preallocate gen6/7 ppgtt

The hardware does not cope very well with us changing the PD within an
active context (the context must be idle for it to re-read the PD). As
we only check whether the page is idle before changing the entry (and on
through the PD tree), we cannot reliably replace PD entries on
gen6/gen7. To fully avoid changing the tree at runtime, preallocate it
on init.
