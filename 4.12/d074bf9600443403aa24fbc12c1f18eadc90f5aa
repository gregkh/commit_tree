vxlan: correctly handle ipv6.disable module parameter

When IPv6 is compiled but disabled at runtime, __vxlan_sock_add returns
-EAFNOSUPPORT. For metadata based tunnels, this causes failure of the whole
operation of bringing up the tunnel.

Ignore failure of IPv6 socket creation for metadata based tunnels caused by
IPv6 not being available.
