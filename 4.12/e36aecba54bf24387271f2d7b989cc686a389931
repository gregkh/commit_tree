drm/imx: imx-ldb: Accept drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge failure

Not having an endpoint bound in DT should not cause a failure here,
there are fallbacks. So explicitly accept a missing endpoint.

This behavior change was introduced by refactoring in drm_of parsing
code and it should not require dts changes.

In particular this fixes imx6qdl-sabreauto boards.
