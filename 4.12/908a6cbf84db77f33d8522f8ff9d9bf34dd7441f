drm/i915/breadcrumbs: Assert that we do not shortcut the current bottom-half

We need to ensure that we always serialize updates to the bottom-half
using the breadcrumbs.irq_lock so that we don't race with a concurrent
interrupt handler. This is most important just prior to leaving the
waiter (when the intel_wait will be overwritten), so make sure we are
not the current bottom-half when skipping the irq locks.
