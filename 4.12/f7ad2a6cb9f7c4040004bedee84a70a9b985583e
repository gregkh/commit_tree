mm: move MADV_FREE pages into LRU_INACTIVE_FILE list

madv()'s MADV_FREE indicate pages are 'lazyfree'.  They are still
anonymous pages, but they can be freed without pageout.  To distinguish
these from normal anonymous pages, we clear their SwapBacked flag.

MADV_FREE pages could be freed without pageout, so they pretty much like
used once file pages.  For such pages, we'd like to reclaim them once
there is memory pressure.  Also it might be unfair reclaiming MADV_FREE
pages always before used once file pages and we definitively want to
reclaim the pages before other anonymous and file pages.

To speed up MADV_FREE pages reclaim, we put the pages into
LRU_INACTIVE_FILE list.  The rationale is LRU_INACTIVE_FILE list is tiny
nowadays and should be full of used once file pages.  Reclaiming
MADV_FREE pages will not have much interfere of anonymous and active
file pages.  And the inactive file pages and MADV_FREE pages will be
reclaimed according to their age, so we don't reclaim too many MADV_FREE
pages too.  Putting the MADV_FREE pages into LRU_INACTIVE_FILE_LIST also
means we can reclaim the pages without swap support.  This idea is
suggested by Johannes.

This patch doesn't move MADV_FREE pages to LRU_INACTIVE_FILE list yet to
avoid bisect failure, next patch will do it.

The patch is based on Minchan's original patch.
