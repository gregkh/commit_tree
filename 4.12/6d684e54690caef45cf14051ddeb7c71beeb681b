rhashtable: Cap total number of entries to 2^31

When max_size is not set or if it set to a sufficiently large
value, the nelems counter can overflow.  This would cause havoc
with the automatic shrinking as it would then attempt to fit a
huge number of entries into a tiny hash table.

This patch fixes this by adding max_elems to struct rhashtable
to cap the number of elements.  This is set to 2^31 as nelems is
not a precise count.  This is sufficiently smaller than UINT_MAX
that it should be safe.

When max_size is set max_elems will be lowered to at most twice
max_size as is the status quo.
