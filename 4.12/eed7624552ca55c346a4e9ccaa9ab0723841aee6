RDMA/mlx4: Fix MAD tunneling when SRIOV is enabled

The cited patch added a type field to structures ib_ah and rdma_ah_attr.

Function mlx4_ib_query_ah() builds an rdma_ah_attr structure from the
data in an mlx4_ib_ah structure (which contains both an ib_ah structure
and an address vector).

For mlx4_ib_query_ah() to work properly, the type field in the contained
ib_ah structure must be set correctly.

In the outgoing MAD tunneling flow, procedure mlx4_ib_multiplex_mad()
paravirtualizes a MAD received from a slave and sends the processed
mad out over the wire. During this processing, it populates an
mlx4_ib_ah structure and calls mlx4_ib_query_ah().

The cited commit overlooked setting the type field in the contained
ib_ah structure before invoking mlx4_ib_query_ah(). As a result, the
type field remained uninitialized, and the rdma_ah_attr structure was
incorrectly built. This resulted in improperly built MADs being sent out
over the wire.

This patch properly initializes the type field in the contained ib_ah
structure before calling mlx4_ib_query_ah(). The rdma_ah_attr structure
is then generated correctly.
