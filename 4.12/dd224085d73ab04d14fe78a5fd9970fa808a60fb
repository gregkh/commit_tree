Input: soc_button_array - properly map usage 0x07/0xe3 to KEY_LEFTMETA

When submitting the support for the ACPI0011 windows tablet keys device I
mapped the "windows" logo homekey to KEY_HOMEPAGE. But this is inconsistent
with how it is done on windows tablets using the old PNP0C40 ACPI device
and it does not match the HUT spec, which says that usage-page 7 usage 0xe3
is "Keyboard Left GUI".

This commit maps usage-page 7 usage 0xe3 to KEY_LEFTMETA fixing this.
