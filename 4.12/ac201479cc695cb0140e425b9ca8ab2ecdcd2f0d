auxdisplay: charlcd: Add support for 4-bit interfaces

In 4-bit mode, 8-bit commands and data are written using two raw writes
to the data interface: high nibble first, low nibble last.  This must be
handled by the low-level driver.

However, as we don't know in which mode (4-bit or 8-bit) nor 4-bit phase
the LCD was left, initialization must always be handled using raw
writes, and needs to configure the LCD for 8-bit mode first.
