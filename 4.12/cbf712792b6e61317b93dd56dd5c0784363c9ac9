KVM: nVMX: fix nested_vmx_check_vmptr failure paths under debugging

kvm_skip_emulated_instruction() will return 0 if userspace is
single-stepping the guest.

kvm_skip_emulated_instruction() uses return status convention of exit
handler: 0 means "exit to userspace" and 1 means "continue vm entries".
The problem is that nested_vmx_check_vmptr() return status means
something else: 0 is ok, 1 is error.

This means we would continue executing after a failure.  Static checker
noticed it because vmptr was not initialized.
