drm/i915: Add some selftests for sg_table manipulation

Start exercising the scattergather lists, especially looking at
iteration after coalescing.

v2: Comment on the peculiarity of table construction (i.e. why this
sg_table might be interesting).
v3: Added one __func__ to identify expect_pfn_sg()
v4: Loop until we have crossed the chain boundary (forcing sg_table to
do multiple allocations) before squelching a potential ENOMEM from oom.
