KEYS: Keyring asymmetric key restrict method with chaining

Add a restrict_link_by_key_or_keyring_chain link restriction that
searches for signing keys in the destination keyring in addition to the
signing key or keyring designated when the destination keyring was
created. Userspace enables this behavior by including the "chain" option
in the keyring restriction:

  keyctl(KEYCTL_RESTRICT_KEYRING, keyring, "asymmetric",
         "key_or_keyring:<signing key>:chain");
