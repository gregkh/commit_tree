i40e: remove unnecessary msleep() delay in i40e_free_vfs

The delay was added because of a desire to ensure that the VF driver can
finish up removing. However, pci_disable_sriov already has its own
ssleep() call that will sleep for an entire second, so there is no
reason to add extra delay on top of this by using msleep here. In
practice, an msleep() won't have a huge impact on timing but there is no
real value in keeping it, so lets just simplify the code and remove it.
