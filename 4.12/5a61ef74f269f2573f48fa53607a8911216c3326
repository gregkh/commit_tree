powerpc/64s: Support new device tree binding for discovering CPU features

The ibm,powerpc-cpu-features device tree binding describes CPU features with
ASCII names and extensible compatibility, privilege, and enablement metadata
that allows improved flexibility and compatibility with new hardware.

The interface is described in detail in ibm,powerpc-cpu-features.txt in this
patch.

Currently this code is not enabled by default, and there are no released
firmwares that provide the binding.
