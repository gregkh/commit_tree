scsi: lpfc: Cleanup entry_repost settings on SLI4 queues

Too many work items being processed in IRQ context take a lot of CPU
time and cause problems.

With a recent change, we get out of the ISR after hitting entry_repost
work items on a queue. However, the actual values for entry repost are
still high. EQ is 128 and CQ is 128, this could translate into
processing 128 * 128 (16384) work items under IRQ context.

Set entry_repost in the actual queue creation routine now.  Limit EQ
repost to 8 and CQ repost to 64 to further limit the amount of time
spent in the IRQ.

Fix fof IRQ routines as well.
