drm/i915: Use atomic page flip for intel again.

This reverts commit 527b6abe5fd2d2
(Revert "drm/i915: Use atomic commits for legacy page_flips")

and reapplies commit ee042aa40b66d1.
("drm/i915: Use atomic commits for legacy page_flips")

The reason for the revert was because legacy cursor updates were
forced to wait for pending page flips and rendering after they
were converted to atomic.

Commit f79f26921ee12c6f
(drm/i915: Add a cursor hack to allow converting legacy page flip to atomic, v3)
adds a fastpath to cursor updates, which fixes the stuttering issues.
With these changes I feel confident enough to re-enable cursor updates.

Legacy cursor update won't block in the following cases:
- Moving cursor
- Changing cursor fb

The legacy cursor update will still block in the following cases:
- Showing/hiding cursor.
- Cursor size or scaling changes.
- cursor update while cursor is invisible (could be fixed, if it turns out to be important).
- Cursor tiling changes (Not sure we support tiled cursors.)
- Last update was a modeset.
