cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fold intel_pstate_reset_all_pid() into the caller

There is only one caller of intel_pstate_reset_all_pid(), which is
pid_param_set() used in the debugfs interface only, and having that
code split does not make it particularly convenient to follow.

For this reason, move the body of intel_pstate_reset_all_pid() into
its caller and drop that function.

Also change the loop from for_each_online_cpu() (which is obviously
racy with respect to CPU offline/online) to for_each_possible_cpu(),
so that all PID parameters are reset for all CPUs regardless of their
online/offline status (to prevent, for example, a previously offline
CPU from going online with a stale set of PID parameters).
