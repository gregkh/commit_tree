drm/i915: Remove intel_ prefix from encoder variables in intel_ddi.c

In I915 driver, there are many places where variable name for
intel_encoder object is given as 'intel_encoder' whereas it would
make more sense to call it just 'encoder' when possible.

This patch does this cleanup in file intel_ddi.c.

PS: There are few functions where both drm_encoder and intel_encoder
are present. For such functions, this patch does nothing.
