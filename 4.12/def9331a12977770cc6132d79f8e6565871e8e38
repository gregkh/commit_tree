x86/amd: don't set X86_BUG_SYSRET_SS_ATTRS when running under Xen

When running as Xen pv guest X86_BUG_SYSRET_SS_ATTRS must not be set
on AMD cpus.

This bug/feature bit is kind of special as it will be used very early
when switching threads. Setting the bit and clearing it a little bit
later leaves a critical window where things can go wrong. This time
window has enlarged a little bit by using setup_clear_cpu_cap() instead
of the hypervisor's set_cpu_features callback. It seems this larger
window now makes it rather easy to hit the problem.

The proper solution is to never set the bit in case of Xen.
