powerpc/powernv: Add sanity checks to pnv_pci_get_{gpu|npu}_dev

The pnv_pci_get_{gpu|npu}_dev functions are used to find associations
between nvlink PCIe devices and standard PCIe devices. However they
lacked basic sanity checking which results in NULL pointer
dereferencing if they are incorrect called can be harder to spot than
an explicit WARN_ON.
