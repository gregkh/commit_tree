drivers:staging:vt6656: remove usb_device_reset in main_usb.c:

Removed the usb_device_reset(), replace with call to usb_reset_device()
directly. Plus it removes the confusing function name and addressed
the checkpatch warning. This change also swaps string in the dev_warn() call
with __func__ argument to "vt6656_probe" instead of literal string
"usb_reset_device".

        WARNING: Prefer using "%s", __func__ to embedded function names
        #417: FILE: main_usb.c:417:
        +                        "usb_device_reset fail status=%d\n", status);

        total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 1058 lines checked

And after fix:

         main_usb.c has no obvious style problems and is ready for submission.
