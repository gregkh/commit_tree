md: raid10: don't use bio's vec table to manage resync pages

Now we allocate one page array for managing resync pages, instead
of using bio's vec table to do that, and the old way is very hacky
and won't work any more if multipage bvec is enabled.

The introduced cost is that we need to allocate (128 + 16) * copies
bytes per r10_bio, and it is fine because the inflight r10_bio for
resync shouldn't be much, as pointed by Shaohua.

Also bio_reset() in raid10_sync_request() and reshape_request()
are removed because all bios are freshly new now in these functions
and not necessary to reset any more.

This patch can be thought as cleanup too.
