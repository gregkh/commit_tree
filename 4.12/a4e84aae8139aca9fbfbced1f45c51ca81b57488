mtip32xx: use runtime tag to initialize command header

mtip32xx supposes that 'request_idx' passed to .init_request()
is tag of the request, and use that as request's tag to initialize
command header.

After MQ IO scheduler is in, request tag assigned isn't same with
the request index anymore, so cause strange hardware failure on
mtip32xx, even whole system panic is triggered.

This patch fixes the issue by initializing command header via
request's real tag.
