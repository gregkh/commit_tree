s390/debugfs: introduce top-level 's390' directory

Introduce a top-level 's390' directory which should be used when
adding new s390 specific debug feature files and/or directories.

This makes hopefully sure that the contents of the s390 directory will
be a bit more structured. Right now we have a couple of top-level
files where it is not easy to tell to which subsystem they belong to.
