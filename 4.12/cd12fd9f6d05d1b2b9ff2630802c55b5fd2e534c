usb: xhci: remove enq_updates and deq_updates from ring

enq_updates and deq_updates were introduced in the first place
to check whether an xhci hardware is able to respond to trbs
enqueued in the ring. We now have trb tracers to trace every
single enqueue/dequeue trb. It's time to remove them and the
associated debugging code.
