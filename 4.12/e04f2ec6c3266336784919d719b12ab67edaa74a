staging: ks7010: continue from loop on unmatched mac

Inside loop, code block is guarded with an 'if' statement. Instead of
guarding the block we can invert the 'if' statement conditional and
continue the loop. Doing so allows subsequent code indentation to be
reduced and aids the readability of the code.

Invert 'if' statement conditional, continue loop if new conditional
evaluates to true. Reduce subsequent code indentation level. Do not
change program logic.
