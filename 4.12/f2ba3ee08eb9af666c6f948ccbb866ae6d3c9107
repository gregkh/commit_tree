tools headers: Sync {tools/,}arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h

We use those in tools/arch/x86/lib/mem{cpy,set}_64.S, in turn used
in the 'perf bench mem' benchmarks.

The changes in the following csets are not relevant for this usecase,
but lets sync it to silence the diff detector in the tools build system:

	6fb895692a03 ("x86/cpufeature: Add 5-level paging detection")
