platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: refactor LED registration

Move a long section of code responsible for registering LEDs out of
acpi_fujitsu_laptop_add() to improve readability and ensure proper
cleanup of platform device and kfifo e.g. when two supported LEDs are
detected, the first one gets registered successfully but the second one
does not.  This makes the result variable in acpi_fujitsu_laptop_add()
redundant, so remove it.  Adjust whitespace to make checkpatch happy.
