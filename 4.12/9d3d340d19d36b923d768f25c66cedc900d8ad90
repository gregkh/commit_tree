Fix crash after issuing lip reset

When RPI is not available, driver sends WQE with invalid RPI value and
rejected by HBA.
lpfc 0000:82:00.3: 1:3154 BLS ABORT RSP failed, data:  x3/xa0320008
and
lpfc :2753 PLOGI failure DID:FFFFFA Status:x3/xa0240008

In this case, driver accesses rpi_ids array out of bounds.

Fix:
Check return value of lpfc_sli4_alloc_rpi(). Do not allocate
lpfc_nodelist entry if RPI is not available.

When RPI is not available, we will get discovery timeouts and
command drops for some of the vports as seen below.

lpfc :0273 Unexpected discovery timeout, vport State x0
lpfc :0230 Unexpected timeout, hba link state x5
lpfc :0111 Dropping received ELS cmd Data: x0 xc90c55 x0
