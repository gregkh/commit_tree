i40e: remove a useless goto statement

The goto found here for when in MFP mode is pointless. It jumps to the
end of a series of if blocks. However, right after this statement is
a closing '}' for this if block, which will result in the program flow
going to the exact same location as the goto statement indicates. Thus,
regardless of whether we are in MFP mode, the program flow will resume
from the same location.

This arose due to various refactoring which did not notice that this
goto became essentially a no-op.

To properly understand this diff you will need to view a larger context
than is given by default.
