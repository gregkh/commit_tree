clk: meson: mpll: use 64bit math in rate_from_params

On Meson8b the MPLL parent clock (fixed_pll) has a rate of 2550MHz.
Multiplying this with SDM_DEN results in a value greater than 32bits.
This is not a problem on the 64bit Meson GX SoCs, but it may result in
undefined behavior on the older 32bit Meson8b SoC.

While rate_from_params was only introduced recently to make the math
reusable from _round_rate and _recalc_rate the original bug exists much
longer.
