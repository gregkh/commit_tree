rtlwifi: btcoex: 21a 2ant: action for wifi is idle/linking/common

Depending on the state of wifi, we need to set different tdma and coex

bt may have low sound quality or mouse lag, which mean bad user
experience. The same problem may occur on wifi also, if could disconnect
or lose some important packets.
