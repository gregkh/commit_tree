i40e: partition the ring_cookie to get VF index

Do not use the user-def field for determining the VF target. Instead,
similar to ixgbe, partition the ring_cookie value into 8bits of VF
index, along with 32bits of queue number. This is better than using the
user-def field, because it leaves the field open for extension in
a future patch which will enable flexible data. Also, this matches with
convention used by ixgbe and other drivers.
