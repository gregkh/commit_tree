platform/x86: hp-wmi: Standardize enum usage for constants

Use enums consistently throughout the hp-wmi driver for groups of
related constants. Use hex and align the assignment within groups. Move
the *QUERY constants into an enum, create a new enum defining the READ,
WRITE, and ODM constants and use them instead of 0 and 1 at the call
sites. Set the command directly instead of using the ternary operator
since both 1 and 3 as previously documented would result in the command
being set to 0x2.
