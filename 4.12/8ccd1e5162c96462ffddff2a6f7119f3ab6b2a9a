MAINTAINERS: Add Lukas Wunner as reviewer for vga_switcheroo

I've been contributing to vga_switcheroo for the past two years and by
now am fairly familiar with it, so danvet suggested that I add myself
as reviewer.

While at it, add missing file pattern for vga_switcheroo.h + vgaarb.h
to the DRM and DRM-MISC sections such that get_maintainer.pl returns
dri-devel@ and the drm-misc maintainers.
