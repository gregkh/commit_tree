i40e/i40evf: Change the way we limit the maximum frame size for Rx

This patch changes the way we handle the maximum frame size for the Rx
path.  Previously we were rounding up to 2K for a 1500 MTU and then brining
the max frame size down to MTU plus a fixed amount.  With this patch
applied what we now do is limit the maximum frame to 1.5K minus the value
for NET_IP_ALIGN for standard MTU, and for any MTU greater than 1500 we
allow up to the maximum frame size.  This makes the behavior more
consistent with the other drivers such as igb which had similar logic.  In
addition it reduces the test matrix for MTU since we only have two max
frame sizes that are handled for Rx now.
