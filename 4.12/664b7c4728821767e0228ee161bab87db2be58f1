pinctrl: core: Fix warning by removing bogus code

Andre Przywara <andre.przywara@arm.com> noticed that we can get the
following warning with -EPROBE_DEFER:

"WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 89 at drivers/base/dd.c:349
driver_probe_device+0x2ac/0x2e8"

Let's fix the issue by removing the indices as suggested by
Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>. All we have to do here is kill the radix
tree.

I probably ended up with the indices after grepping for removal
of all entries using radix_tree_for_each_slot() and the first
match found was gmap_radix_tree_free(). Anyways, no need for
indices here, and we can just do remove all the entries using
radix_tree_for_each_slot() along how the item_kill_tree() test
case does.
