clk: sunxi-ng: a80: Fix audio PLL comment not matching actual code

We ignore the d1 and d2 dividers in the audio PLL, and force them to
1 (register value 0) at probe time. However the comment preceding the
audio PLL definition says we enforce the default value, which is not
the same.

Fix the preceding comment to match what we do in code.
