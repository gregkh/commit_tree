staging: ks7010: remove duplicate code

Current switch statement has duplicate code in branches. This code can
be put after the switch statement so as to remove the duplication.

Move code to after switch statement, remove duplicate code. Make error
branch return so as not to execute the moved code block. Do not change
the program logic.
