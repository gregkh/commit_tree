arch/sparc: support NR_CPUS = 4096

Linux SPARC64 limits NR_CPUS to 4064 because init_cpu_send_mondo_info()
only allocates a single page for NR_CPUS mondo entries. Thus we cannot
use all 4096 CPUs on some SPARC platforms.

To fix, allocate (2^order) pages where order is set according to the size
of cpu_list for possible cpus. Since cpu_list_pa and cpu_mondo_block_pa
are not used in asm code, there are no imm13 offsets from the base PA
that will break because they can only reach one page.
