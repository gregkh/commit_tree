drm/mediatek: update DSI sub driver flow for sending commands to panel

This patch update enable/disable flow of DSI module.
Original flow works on there is a bridge chip: DSI -> bridge -> panel.
In this case: DSI -> panel, the DSI sub driver flow should be updated.
We need to initialize DSI first so that we can send commands to panel.
