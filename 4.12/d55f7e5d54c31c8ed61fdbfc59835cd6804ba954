drm: Create DEFINE_DRM_GEM_CMA_FOPS and roll it out to drivers

Less code ftw.

This converts all drivers except the tinydrm helper module. That one
needs more work, since it gets the THIS_MODULE reference from
tinydrm.ko instead of the actual driver module like it should.
Probably needs a similar trick like I used here with generating the
entire struct with a macro.
