arm64: arch_timer: Workaround for Cortex-A73 erratum 858921

Cortex-A73 (all versions) counter read can return a wrong value
when the counter crosses a 32bit boundary.

The workaround involves performing the read twice, and to return
one or the other depending on whether a transition has taken place.
