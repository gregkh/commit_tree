drm/i915/dsi: Document always using v3 SHUTDOWN / MIPI_SEQ_DISPLAY_OFF order

According to the spec for v2 VBTs we should call MIPI_SEQ_DISPLAY_OFF
before sending SHUTDOWN, where as for v3 VBTs we should send SHUTDOWN
first.

Since the v2 order has known issues, we use the v3 order everywhere,
add a comment documenting this.
