pinctrl: generic: Add bi-directional and output-enable

Add bi-directional and output-enable pin configuration properties.

bi-directional allows to specify when a pin shall operate in input and
output mode at the same time. This is particularly useful in platforms
where input and output buffers have to be manually enabled.

output-enable is just syntactic sugar to specify that a pin shall
operate in output mode, ignoring the provided argument.
This pairs with input-enable pin configuration option.
