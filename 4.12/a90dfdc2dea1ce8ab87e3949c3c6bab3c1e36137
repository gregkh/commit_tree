scsi: sd: sd_zbc: Rename sd_zbc_setup_write_cmnd

Rename sd_zbc_setup_write_cmnd() to sd_zbc_write_lock_zone() to be clear
about what the function actually does. To be consistent, also rename
sd_zbc_cancel_write_cmnd() to sd_zbc_write_unlock_zone().

No functional change is introduced by this patch.
