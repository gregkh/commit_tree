perf annotate: Fix AArch64 comment char

The commit 0fcb1da4aba "perf annotate: AArch64 support" blindly copied
the comment character from the original:

            https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/19/461

whereas that same commit shows objdump output utilizing the C++ style
"//" as the comment delimeter.  Since '/' doesn't occur elsewhere in
objdump output, we retain the single character check, but fix it to be
'/'.
