Fix nvme unregister port timeout.

During some link event testing it was observed that the
wait_for_completion_timeout in the lpfc_nvme_unregister_port
was timing out all the time.

The initiator is claiming the nvme_fc_unregister_remoteport upcall is
not completing the unregister in the time allotted.
[ 2186.151317] lpfc 0000:07:00.0: 0:(0):6169 Unreg nvme wait failed 0

 The wait_for_completion_timeout returns 0 when the wait has
been outstanding for the jiffies passed by the caller.  In this error
message, the nvme initiator passed value 5 - meaning 5 jiffies -
and this is just wrong.

Calculate 5 seconds in Jiffies and pass that value
from the current jiffies.

Also the log message for the unregister timeout was reduced
because timeout failure is the same as timeout.
