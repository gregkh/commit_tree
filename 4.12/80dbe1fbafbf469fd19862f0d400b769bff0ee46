vfio/type1: Prune vfio_pin_page_external()

With vfio_lock_acct() testing the locked memory limit under mmap_sem,
it's redundant to do it here for a single page.  We can also reorder
our tests such that we can avoid testing for reserved pages if we're
not doing accounting and let vfio_lock_acct() test the process
CAP_IPC_LOCK.  Finally, this function oddly returns 1 on success.
Update to return zero on success, -errno on error.  Since the function
only pins a single page, there's no need to return the number of pages
pinned.

N.B. vfio_pin_pages_remote() can pin a large contiguous range of pages
before calling vfio_lock_acct().  If we were to similarly remove the
extra test there, a user could temporarily pin far more pages than
they're allowed.
