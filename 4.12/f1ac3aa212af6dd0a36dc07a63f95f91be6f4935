brcmfmac: always print error when PSM's watchdog fires

So far we were attaching BRCMF_E_PSM_WATCHDOG event listener in
brcmf_debug_attach which gets compiled only with CONFIG_BRCMDBG. This
event means something went wrong and firmware / hardware usually can't
be expected to work (reliably).

Such a problem is significant for user experience so I believe we should
print an error unconditionally (even with debugging disabled). What can
be indeed optional is dumping bus memory as this is clearly part of
debugging process.

In the future we may also try to extend this listener by trying to
recover from the error or at least signal it to the cfg80211.
