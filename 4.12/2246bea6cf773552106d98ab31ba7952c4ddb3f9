drm/i915: Postpone fake breadcrumb interrupt until real interrupts cease

When the timer expires for checking on interrupt processing, check to
see if any interrupts arrived within the last time period. If real
interrupts are still being delivered, we can be reassured that we
haven't missed the final interrupt as the waiter will still be woken.
Only once all activity ceases, do we have to worry about the waiter
never being woken and so need to install a timer to kick the waiter for
a slow arrival of a seqno.
