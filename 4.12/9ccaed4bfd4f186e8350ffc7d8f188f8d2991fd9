acpi, nfit: limit ->flush_probe() to initialization work

The nvdimm probe flushing mechanism gives userspace a sync point where
it knows all asynchronous driver probe sequences have completed.
However, it need not wait for other asynchronous actions, like
on-demand address-range-scrub. Track the init work separately from other
work in the workqueue, and only flush the former.
