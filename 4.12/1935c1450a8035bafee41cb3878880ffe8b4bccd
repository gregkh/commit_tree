staging: ks7010: Unnecessary parentheses removed and improved coding style.

Unnecessary parentheses are removed as reported by checkpatch.pl
to make coder nicer and to improve readability.
Also coding style is improved as it's often nicer to read if
 &(foo[0]) is converted to foo like:
 memcpy(&(ap->bssid[0]), &(ap_info->bssid[0]), ETH_ALEN);
 memcpy(ap->bssid, ap_info->bssid, ETH_ALEN);
