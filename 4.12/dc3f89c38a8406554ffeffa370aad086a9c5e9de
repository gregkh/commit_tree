libertas: check return value of alloc_workqueue

Function alloc_workqueue() will return a NULL pointer if there is no
enough memory, and its return value should be validated before using.
However, in function if_spi_probe(), its return value is not checked.
This may result in a NULL dereference bug. This patch fixes the bug.
