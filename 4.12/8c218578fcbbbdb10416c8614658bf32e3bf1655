powerpc/perf: Fix Power9 test_adder fields

Commit 8d911904f3ce4 ('powerpc/perf: Add restrictions to PMC5 in power9 DD1')
was added to restrict the use of PMC5 in Power9 DD1. Intention was to disable
the use of PMC5 using raw event code. But instead of updating the
power9_isa207_pmu structure (used on DD1), the commit incorrectly updated the
power9_pmu structure. Fix it.
