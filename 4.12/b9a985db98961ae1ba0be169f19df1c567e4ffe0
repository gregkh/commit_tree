pid_ns: Sleep in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE in zap_pid_ns_processes

The code can potentially sleep for an indefinite amount of time in
zap_pid_ns_processes triggering the hung task timeout, and increasing
the system average.  This is undesirable.  Sleep with a task state of
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE instead of TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE to remove these
undesirable side effects.

Apparently under heavy load this has been allowing Chrome to trigger
the hung time task timeout error and cause ChromeOS to reboot.
