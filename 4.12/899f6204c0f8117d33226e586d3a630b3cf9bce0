drm/i915/execlists: Split the atomic test_and_clear_bit for irq handler

Rather than impose the cost of a locked test before queuing a new
request, reduce it to a simple test_bit() with a following clear_bit()
prior to doing the CSB check. This ensure that if an interrupt does
occur whilst reading from the CSB, we still detect it (the interrupt
would trigger a rescheduling of the tasklet anyway).
