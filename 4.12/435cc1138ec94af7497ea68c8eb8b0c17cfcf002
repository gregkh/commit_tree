usb: host: xhci-plat: set resume_quirk() for R-Car controllers

This patch sets resume_quirk() for R-Car controllers to re-download
the firmware in resume timing. Otherwise, if the controller's power
is down in suspend timing, the firmware in the controller goes away,
and then the controller doesn't work after resume.
