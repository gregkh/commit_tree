IB/hfi1: Use bool in process_ecn

The process_ecn intends to return a bool value. However it is doing
so incorrectly by ANDing the fecn mask. The fecn bit is bit 31. Bool is
not a native data type and is up to the compiler to implement how it
sees fit. It is conceivable that this upper bit gets washed out.

Fix by converting to a bool properly.
