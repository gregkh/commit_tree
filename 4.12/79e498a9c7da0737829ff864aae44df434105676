net: phy: micrel: Restore led_mode and clk_sel on resume

These bits seem to be lost after a suspend/resume cycle so just set them
again. Do this by splitting the handling of these bits into a function
that is also called on resume.

This patch fixes ethernet suspend/resume on imx6ul-14x14-evk boards.
