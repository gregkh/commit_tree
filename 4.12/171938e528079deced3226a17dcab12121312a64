btrfs: track exclusive filesystem operation in flags

There are several operations, usually started from ioctls, that cannot
run concurrently. The status is tracked in
mutually_exclusive_operation_running as an atomic_t. We can easily track
the status as one of the per-filesystem flag bits with same
synchronization guarantees.

The conversion replaces:

* atomic_xchg(..., 1)    ->   test_and_set_bit(FLAG, ...)
* atomic_set(..., 0)     ->   clear_bit(FLAG, ...)
