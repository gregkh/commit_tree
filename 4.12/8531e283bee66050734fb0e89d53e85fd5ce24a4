PCI: Recognize Thunderbolt devices

Detect on probe whether a PCI device is part of a Thunderbolt controller.
Intel uses a Vendor-Specific Extended Capability (VSEC) with ID 0x1234
on such devices.  Detect presence of this VSEC and cache it in a newly
added is_thunderbolt bit in struct pci_dev.

Also, add a helper to check whether a given PCI device is situated on a
Thunderbolt daisy chain (i.e., below a PCI device with is_thunderbolt
set).

The necessity arises from the following:

* If an external Thunderbolt GPU is connected to a dual GPU laptop,
  that GPU is currently registered with vga_switcheroo even though it
  can neither drive the laptop's panel nor be powered off by the
  platform.  To vga_switcheroo it will appear as if two discrete
  GPUs are present.  As a result, when the external GPU is runtime
  suspended, vga_switcheroo will cut power to the internal discrete GPU
  which may not be runtime suspended at all at this moment.  The
  solution is to not register external GPUs with vga_switcheroo, which
  necessitates a way to recognize if they're on a Thunderbolt daisy
  chain.

* Dual GPU MacBook Pros introduced 2011+ can no longer switch external
  DisplayPort ports between GPUs.  (They're no longer just used for DP
  but have become combined DP/Thunderbolt ports.)  The driver to switch
  the ports, drivers/platform/x86/apple-gmux.c, needs to detect presence
  of a Thunderbolt controller and, if found, keep external ports
  permanently switched to the discrete GPU.

v2: Make kerneldoc for pci_is_thunderbolt_attached() more precise,
