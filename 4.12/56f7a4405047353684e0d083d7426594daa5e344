KVM: MIPS: Add VZ support to build system

Add support for the MIPS Virtualization (VZ) ASE to the MIPS KVM build
system. For now KVM can only be configured for T&E or VZ and not both,
but the design of the user facing APIs support the possibility of having
both available, so this could change in future.

Note that support for various optional guest features (some of which
can't be turned off) are implemented in immediately following commits,
so although it should now be possible to build VZ support, it may not
work yet on your hardware.
