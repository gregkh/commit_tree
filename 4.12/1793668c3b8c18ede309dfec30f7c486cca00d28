i40e/i40evf: Update code to better handle incrementing page count

Update the driver code so that we do bulk updates of the page reference
count instead of just incrementing it by one reference at a time.  The
advantage to doing this is that we cut down on atomic operations and
this in turn should give us a slight improvement in cycles per packet.
In addition if we eventually move this over to using build_skb the gains
will be more noticeable.

I also found and fixed a store forwarding stall from where we were
assigning "*new_buff = *old_buff".  By breaking it up into individual
copies we can avoid this and as a result the performance is slightly
improved.
