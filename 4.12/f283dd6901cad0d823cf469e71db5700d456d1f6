staging: ks7010: make goto labels uniform

Driver uses different label forms for similar purposes. It would be
more clear if single use case has uniform label. 'out' is generic and
adds no meaning to label.

Documentation/process/coding-style.rst:
Choose label names which say what the goto does or why the goto
exists.

Rename labels so as to better describe what they do. If an execution
path only exists for the label on an error, prefix the label with
'err_'. If a non-error execution path exist do not use prefix.
