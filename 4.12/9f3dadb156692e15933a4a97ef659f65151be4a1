ALSA: hda - A new flag to enforce prefix to each pin

This is a preliminary patch for a smooth multi-codec support, and it
introduces a new flag, force_pin_prefix, to struct hda_codec.
This flag is used to force to add the pin location prefix to each
input pin.  For example, when there is only one microphone pin,
usually the auto-parser assigns the string "Mic".  With this flag on,
it'll be like "Front Mic".  Also, the creation of "Master" or "PCM"
playback volume for a single pin is suppressed, too.
