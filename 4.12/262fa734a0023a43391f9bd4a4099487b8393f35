x86/unwind: Dump all stacks in unwind_dump()

Currently unwind_dump() dumps only the most recently accessed stack.
But it has a few issues.

In some cases, 'first_sp' can get out of sync with 'stack_info', causing
unwind_dump() to start from the wrong address, flood the printk buffer,
and eventually read a bad address.

In other cases, dumping only the most recently accessed stack doesn't
give enough data to diagnose the error.

Fix both issues by dumping *all* stacks involved in the trace, not just
the last one.
