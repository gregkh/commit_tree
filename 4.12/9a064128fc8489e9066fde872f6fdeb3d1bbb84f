i40e/i40evf: Pull code for grabbing and syncing rx_buffer from fetch_buffer

This patch pulls the code responsible for fetching the Rx buffer and
synchronizing DMA into a function, specifically called i40e_get_rx_buffer.

The general idea is to allow for better code reuse by pulling this out of
i40e_fetch_rx_buffer.  We dropped a couple of prefetches since the time
between the prefetch being called and the data being accessed was too small
to be useful.
