drm/i915: Avoid spurious WARNs about the wrong pipe in the PPS code

Until recently vlv_steal_power_sequencer() wasn't being called for
normal DP ports, and hence it could assert that it should only be
called for pipe A and B (since pipe C doesn't support eDP). However
that changed when we started to consider normal DP ports as well when
choosing a PPS. So we will now get spurious warnings when
vlv_steal_power_sequencer() does get called for pipe C. Avoid this by
moving the WARN down into vlv_detach_power_sequencer() where this
assertion should still hold.
