platform/x86: Add Intel Cherry Trail ACPI INT33FE device driver

The INT33FE ACPI device has a CRS table with I2cSerialBusV2 resources for
3 devices: Maxim MAX17047 Fuel Gauge Controller, FUSB302 USB Type-C
Controller and PI3USB30532 USB switch.

This commit adds a driver for this ACPI device which instantiates
i2c-clients for these, so that the standard i2c drivers for these chips
can bind to the them.
