cpufreq: intel_pstate: Drop driver_registered variable

The driver_registered variable in intel_pstate is used for checking
whether or not the driver has been registered, but intel_pstate_driver
can be used for that too (with the rule that the driver is not
registered as long as it is NULL).

That is a bit more straightforward and the code may be simplified
a bit this way, so modify the driver accordingly.
