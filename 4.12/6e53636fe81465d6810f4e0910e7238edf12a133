dm raid: add raid4/5/6 journal write-back support via journal_mode option

Commit 63c32ed4afc ("dm raid: add raid4/5/6 journaling support") added
journal support to close the raid4/5/6 "write hole" -- in terms of
writethrough caching.

Introduce a "journal_mode" feature and use the new
r5c_journal_mode_set() API to add support for switching the journal
device's cache mode between write-through (the current default) and
write-back.

NOTE: If the journal device is not layered on resilent storage and it
fails, write-through mode will cause the "write hole" to reoccur.  But
if the journal fails while in write-back mode it will cause data loss
for any dirty cache entries unless resilent storage is used for the
journal.
