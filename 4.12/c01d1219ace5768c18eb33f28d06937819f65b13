mmc: meson-gx: improve initial configuration

Config values which are not changed during runtime we can set
in the probe function already.
The block size setting is overwritten later in
meson_mmc_start_cmd anyway if needed, so it doesn't harm if we
remove this setting in meson_mmc_set_ios.

In addition write config register only if configuration changed.

Don't change the location of clock initialization as in an
earlier version of the patch, this change causes a hang.
