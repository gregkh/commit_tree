fsnotify: Provide framework for dropping SRCU lock in ->handle_event

fanotify wants to drop fsnotify_mark_srcu lock when waiting for response
from userspace so that the whole notification subsystem is not blocked
during that time. This patch provides a framework for safely getting
mark reference for a mark found in the object list which pins the mark
in that list. We can then drop fsnotify_mark_srcu, wait for userspace
response and then safely continue iteration of the object list once we
reaquire fsnotify_mark_srcu.
