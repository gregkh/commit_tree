fpga: region: release FPGA region reference in error path

If fpga_region_get_manager() fails in fpga_region_program_fpga(), a
reference to the fpga_manager instance previously acquired through
fpga_region_get() is retained. Make sure to properly release it in the
error case by using a separate jump label which will call
fpga_region_put() in before returning.
