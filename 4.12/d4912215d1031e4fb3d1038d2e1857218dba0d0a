This is triggered occasionally by running both win7 and win2016 in L2, in
addition, EPT is disabled on both L1 and L2. It can't be reproduced easily.

Commit 0b6ac343fc (KVM: nVMX: Correct handling of exception injection) mentioned
that "KVM wants to inject page-faults which it got to the guest. This function
assumes it is called with the exit reason in vmcs02 being a #PF exception".
Commit e011c663 (KVM: nVMX: Check all exceptions for intercept during delivery to
L2) allows to check all exceptions for intercept during delivery to L2. However,
there is no guarantee the exit reason is exception currently, when there is an
external interrupt occurred on host, maybe a time interrupt for host which should
not be injected to guest, and somewhere queues an exception, then the function
nested_vmx_check_exception() will be called and the vmexit emulation codes will
try to emulate the "Acknowledge interrupt on exit" behavior, the warning is
triggered.

Reusing the exit reason from the L2->L0 vmexit is wrong in this case,
the reason must always be EXCEPTION_NMI when injecting an exception into
L1 as a nested vmexit.
