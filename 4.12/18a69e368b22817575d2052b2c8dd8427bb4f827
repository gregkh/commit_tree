qed: Send pf-flr as part of initialization

During HW initialization, driver would set various registers to their
needed values - but it assumes all registers start at their reset-value,
so there's no need to re-configure a register's default value.

This assumption might be incorrect, e.g., in case of preboot driver
running and initializing the driver prior to our driver.

To overcome this, we now ask management firmware to initiate a PF-flr
early during the initialization sequence. That would return everything
in the PF's scope back to default and prevent previous configurations
from still being applied.
