net: Generic XDP

This provides a generic SKB based non-optimized XDP path which is used
if either the driver lacks a specific XDP implementation, or the user
requests it via a new IFLA_XDP_FLAGS value named XDP_FLAGS_SKB_MODE.

It is arguable that perhaps I should have required something like
this as part of the initial XDP feature merge.

I believe this is critical for two reasons:

1) Accessibility.  More people can play with XDP with less
   dependencies.  Yes I know we have XDP support in virtio_net, but
   that just creates another depedency for learning how to use this
   facility.

   I wrote this to make life easier for the XDP newbies.

2) As a model for what the expected semantics are.  If there is a pure
   generic core implementation, it serves as a semantic example for
   driver folks adding XDP support.

One thing I have not tried to address here is the issue of
XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM, thanks to Daniel for spotting that.  It seems
incredibly expensive to do a skb_cow(skb, XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM) or
whatever even if the XDP program doesn't try to push headers at all.
I think we really need the verifier to somehow propagate whether
certain XDP helpers are used or not.

v5:
 - Handle both negative and positive offset after running prog
 - Fix mac length in XDP_TX case (Alexei)
 - Use rcu_dereference_protected() in free_netdev (kbuild test robot)

v4:
 - Fix MAC header adjustmnet before calling prog (David Ahern)
 - Disable LRO when generic XDP is installed (Michael Chan)
 - Bypass qdisc et al. on XDP_TX and record the event (Alexei)
 - Do not perform generic XDP on reinjected packets (DaveM)

v3:
 - Make sure XDP program sees packet at MAC header, push back MAC
   header if we do XDP_TX.  (Alexei)
 - Elide GRO when generic XDP is in use.  (Alexei)
 - Add XDP_FLAG_SKB_MODE flag which the user can use to request generic
   XDP even if the driver has an XDP implementation.  (Alexei)
 - Report whether SKB mode is in use in rtnl_xdp_fill() via XDP_FLAGS
   attribute.  (Daniel)

v2:
 - Add some "fall through" comments in switch statements based
   upon feedback from Andrew Lunn
 - Use RCU for generic xdp_prog, thanks to Johannes Berg.
