drm/i915/gtt: Make I915_PDPES_PER_PDP inline function

The macro takes a vm pointer at some sites, and dev_priv on others
We were saved as the internal macro never deferences the pointer
given.

As the number of pdpes depend on vm configuration, make it
as a inline function that accepts vm pointer.
