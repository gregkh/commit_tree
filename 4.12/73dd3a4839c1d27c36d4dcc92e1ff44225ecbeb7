net/mlx5: Avoid using pending command interface slots

Currently when firmware command gets stuck or it takes long time to
complete, the driver command will get timeout and the command slot is
freed and can be used for new commands, and if the firmware receive new
command on the old busy slot its behavior is unexpected and this could
be harmful.
To fix this when the driver command gets timeout we return failure,
but we don't free the command slot and we wait for the firmware to
explicitly respond to that command.
Once all the entries are busy we will stop processing new firmware
commands.
