x86/platform/intel/iosf_mbi: Add a mutex for P-Unit access

One some systems the P-Unit accesses the PMIC to change various voltages
through the same bus as other kernel drivers use for e.g. battery
monitoring.

If a driver sends requests to the P-Unit which require the P-Unit to access
the PMIC bus while another driver is also accessing the PMIC bus various
bad things happen.

This commit adds a mutex to protect the P-Unit against simultaneous
accesses and 2 functions to lock / unlock this mutex.

Note on these systems the i2c-bus driver will request a sempahore from the
P-Unit for exclusive access to the PMIC bus when i2c drivers are accessing
it, but this does not appear to be sufficient, we still need to avoid
making certain P-Unit requests during the access window to avoid problems.
