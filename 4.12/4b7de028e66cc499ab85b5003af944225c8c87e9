KVM: MIPS/VZ: Support guest segmentation control

Add support for VZ guest CP0_SegCtl0, CP0_SegCtl1, and CP0_SegCtl2
registers, as found on P5600 and P6600 cores. These guest registers need
initialising, context switching, and exposing via the KVM ioctl API when
they are present.

They also require the GVA -> GPA translation code for handling a GVA
root exception to be updated to interpret the segmentation registers and
decode the faulting instruction enough to detect EVA memory access
instructions.
