KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Improve sync_hwstate performance

There is no need to call any functions to fold LRs when we don't use any
LRs and we don't need to mess with overflow flags, take spinlocks, or
prune the AP list if the AP list is empty.

Note: list_empty is a single atomic read (uses READ_ONCE) and can
therefore check if a list is empty or not without the need to take the
spinlock protecting the list.
