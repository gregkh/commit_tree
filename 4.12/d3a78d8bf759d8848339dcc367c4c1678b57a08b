PCI: hv: Properly handle PCI bus remove

hv_pci_devices_present() is called in hv_pci_remove() when we remove a PCI
device from the host, e.g., by disabling SR-IOV on a device.  In
hv_pci_remove(), the bus is already removed before the call, so we don't
need to rescan the bus in the workqueue scheduled from
hv_pci_devices_present().

By introducing bus state hv_pcibus_removed, we can avoid this situation.
