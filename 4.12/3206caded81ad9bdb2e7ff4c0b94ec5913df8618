netfilter: nft_hash: support of symmetric hash

This patch provides symmetric hash support according to source
ip address and port, and destination ip address and port.

For this purpose, the __skb_get_hash_symmetric() is used to
identify the flow as it uses FLOW_DISSECTOR_F_STOP_AT_FLOW_LABEL
flag by default.

The new attribute NFTA_HASH_TYPE has been included to support
different types of hashing functions. Currently supported
NFT_HASH_JENKINS through jhash and NFT_HASH_SYM through symhash.

The main difference between both types are:
 - jhash requires an expression with sreg, symhash doesn't.
 - symhash supports modulus and offset, but not seed.

Examples:

 nft add rule ip nat prerouting ct mark set jhash ip saddr mod 2
 nft add rule ip nat prerouting ct mark set symhash mod 2

By default, jenkins hash will be used if no hash type is
provided for compatibility reasons.
