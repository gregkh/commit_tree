NFSv4.1: Fix a race in nfs4_proc_layoutget

If the task calling layoutget is signalled, then it is possible for the
calls to nfs4_sequence_free_slot() and nfs4_layoutget_prepare() to race,
in which case we leak a slot.
The fix is to move the call to nfs4_sequence_free_slot() into the
nfs4_layoutget_release() so that it gets called at task teardown time.
