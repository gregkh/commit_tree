ext4: clean up ext4_match() and callers

When ext4 encryption was originally merged, we were encrypting the
user-specified filename in ext4_match(), introducing a lot of additional
complexity into ext4_match() and its callers.  This has since been
changed to encrypt the filename earlier, so we can remove the gunk
that's no longer needed.  This more or less reverts ext4_search_dir()
and ext4_find_dest_de() to the way they were in the v4.0 kernel.
