HID: usbhid: extend polling interval configuration to joysticks

For mouse devices we can currently change the polling interval
via usbhid.mousepoll. Implement the same thing for joysticks, so
users can reduce input latency this way.

This has been tested with a Logitech RumblePad 2 with jspoll=2,
resulting in a polling rate of 500Hz (verified with evhz).
