i40e: don't re-enable ATR when flushing filters if SB has TCP4/IPv4 rules

When flushing and replaying FDIR filters, it is possible we would
disable ATR, and then re-enable it even though we should have kept
it disabled due to existing TCP/IPv4 filters. Fix this by checking
whether we have TCP4/IPv4 filters before re-enabling.

Alternatively, we could instead restore ATR and then replay filters,
however, this would cause us to rapidly enable and then disable ATR in
some cases.
