lightnvm: assume 64-bit lba numbers

The driver uses both u64 and sector_t to refer to offsets, and assigns between the
two. This causes one harmless warning when sector_t is 32-bit:

drivers/lightnvm/pblk-rb.c: In function 'pblk_rb_write_entry_gc':
include/linux/lightnvm.h:215:20: error: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Werror=overflow]
drivers/lightnvm/pblk-rb.c:324:22: note: in expansion of macro 'ADDR_EMPTY'

As the driver is already doing this inconsistently, changing the type
won't make it worse and is an easy way to avoid the warning.
