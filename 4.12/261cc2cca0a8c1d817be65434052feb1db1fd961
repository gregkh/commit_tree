Btrfs: consistent usage of types in balance_args

The btrfs_balance_args are only used for the balance ioctl, so use __u
instead of __le here for consistency. The __le usage was introduced in
bc3094673f22d and dee32d0ac3719 and was probably a result of
copy/pasting when the code was written.

The usage of __le did not break anything, but it's unnecessary. Also,
this change makes the code less confusing for the careful reader.
