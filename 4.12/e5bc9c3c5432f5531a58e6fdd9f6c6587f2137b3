md: clear WantReplacement once disk is removed

We can clear 'WantReplacement' flag directly no
matter it's replacement existed or not since the
semantic is same as before.

Also since the disk is removed from array, then
it is straightforward to remove 'WantReplacement'
flag and the comments in raid10/5 can be removed
as well.
