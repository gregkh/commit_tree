net: mpls: Convert number of nexthops to u8

Number of nexthops and number of alive nexthops are tracked using an
unsigned int. A route should never have more than 255 nexthops so
convert both to u8. Update all references and intermediate variables
to consistently use u8 as well.

Shrinks the size of mpls_route from 32 bytes to 24 bytes with a 2-byte
hole before the nexthops.
