netlink/diag: report flags for netlink sockets

cb_running is reported in /proc/self/net/netlink and it is reported by
the ss tool, when it gets information from the proc files.

sock_diag is a new interface which is used instead of proc files, so it
looks reasonable that this interface has to report no less information
about sockets than proc files.

We use these flags to dump and restore netlink sockets.
