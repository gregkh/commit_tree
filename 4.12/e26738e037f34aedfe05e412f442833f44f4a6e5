block: add a error_count field to struct request

This is for the legacy floppy and ataflop drivers that currently abuse
->errors for this purpose.  It's stashed away in a union to not grow
the struct size, the other fields are either used by modern drivers
for different purposes or the I/O scheduler before queing the I/O
to drivers.
