drm/i915: Defer enabling hangcheck to the first fake breadcrumb interrupt

By deferring hangcheck to the fake breadcrumb interrupt, we can simply
the enabling procedure slightly - as by enabling the fake, we then
enable the hangcheck. By always enabling the hangcheck from each fake
interrupt (it will be a no-op for an already queued hangcheck), it will
make restoring the breadcrumbs after a reset simpler in the next patch.
