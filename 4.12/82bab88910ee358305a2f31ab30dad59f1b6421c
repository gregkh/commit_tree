ASoC: codec: wm8960: Relax bit clock computation when using PLL

Bitclk is derived from sysclk using bclk_divs.
Sysclk can be derived in two ways:
	(1) directly from MLCK
	(2) MCLK via PLL

Commit 3c01b9ee2ab9d0d ("ASoC: codec: wm8960: Relax bit clock
computation")
relaxed bitclk computation when sysclk is directly derived from MCLK.

Lets do the same thing when sysclk is derived via PLL.
