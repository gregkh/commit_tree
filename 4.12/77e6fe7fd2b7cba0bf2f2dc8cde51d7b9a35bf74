serial: omap: suspend device on probe errors

Make sure to actually suspend the device before returning after a failed
(or deferred) probe.

Note that autosuspend must be disabled before runtime pm is disabled in
order to balance the usage count due to a negative autosuspend delay as
well as to make the final put suspend the device synchronously.
