staging: ks7010: removed code in comments.

Commenting Code Is a Bad Idea.
Comments are their to explain the code and how the code achieves its
goal and as codes in the comments  does not explain what the code is
doing so there is no use of commenting them.
So in this patch codes in the comments are removed.
