drm/i915: Remove Braswell GGTT update w/a

Testing with concurrent GGTT accesses no longer show the coherency
problems from yonder, commit 5bab6f60cb4d ("drm/i915: Serialise updates
to GGTT with access through GGTT on Braswell"). My presumption is that
the root cause was more likely fixed by commit 3b5724d702ef ("drm/i915:
Wait for writes through the GTT to land before reading back"), along
with the use of WC updates to the global gTT in commit 8448661d65f6
("drm/i915: Convert clflushed pagetables over to WC maps". Given
that the original symptoms can no longer be reproduced, time to remove
the workaround.
