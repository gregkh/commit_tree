HID: sony: Remove report descriptor fixup for DS4

The DS4 in BT mode sends initial input reports through report 1, which
is described in the HID report descriptors. When activated after sending
a certain feature report, the device uses report 17.

Currently the hid-sony driver fixes up the BT HID report descriptors,
so the HID layer can manage input reports for report 17.

We think it is best to eliminate this fixup and do the handling ourselves,
which is what this patch does. The main motivation is that there are
various users of DS4 through hidraw, including various cross-platform
applications/games, which have their own HID parsing across Linux/Win/OSX.
Due to the fixup the descriptors differ, which is causing pain for many
developers including major game publishers (who reached out privately).
Without the fixup, the Windows titles also have a fighting chance for
working on Wine, which provides HID support now. Overall it felt
best because of these reasons to remove the fixup.
