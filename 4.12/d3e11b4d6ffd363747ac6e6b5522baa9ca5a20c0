x86/intel_rdt: Move CBM specific data into a struct

Memory bandwidth allocation requires different information than cache
allocation.

To avoid a lump of data in struct rdt_resource, move all cache related
information into a seperate structure and add that to struct rdt_resource.

Sanitize the data types while at it.
