PCI: Ignore requested alignment for IOV BARs

We would call pci_reassigndev_resource_alignment() before
pci_init_capabilities().  So the requested alignment would never work for
IOV BARs.

Furthermore, it's meaningless to request additional alignment for IOV BARs,
the IOV BAR alignment is only determined by the VF BAR size.
