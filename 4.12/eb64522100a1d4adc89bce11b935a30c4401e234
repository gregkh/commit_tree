arm64/arch_timer: Mark errata handlers as __maybe_unused

In some rare randconfig builds, we end up with two functions being entirely
unused:

drivers/clocksource/arm_arch_timer.c:342:12: error: 'erratum_set_next_event_tval_phys' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
 static int erratum_set_next_event_tval_phys(unsigned long evt,
drivers/clocksource/arm_arch_timer.c:335:12: error: 'erratum_set_next_event_tval_virt' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
 static int erratum_set_next_event_tval_virt(unsigned long evt,

We could add an #ifdef around them, but we would already have to check for
several symbols there and there is a chance this would get more complicated
over time, so marking them as __maybe_unused is the simplest way to avoid the
harmless warnings.
