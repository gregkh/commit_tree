x86/process: Correct and optimize TIF_BLOCKSTEP switch

The debug control MSR is "highly magical" as the blockstep bit can be
cleared by hardware under not well documented circumstances.

So a task switch relying on the bit set by the previous task (according to
the previous tasks thread flags) can trip over this and not update the flag
for the next task.

To fix this its required to handle DEBUGCTLMSR_BTF when either the previous
or the next or both tasks have the TIF_BLOCKSTEP flag set.

While at it avoid branching within the TIF_BLOCKSTEP case and evaluating
boot_cpu_data twice in kernels without CONFIG_X86_DEBUGCTLMSR.

[ tglx: Made the shift value explicit, use a local variable to make the
code readable and massaged changelog]
