dm cache policy smq: allow demotions to happen even during continuous IO

dm-cache's smq policy tries hard to do it's work during the idle periods
when there is no IO.  But if there are no idle periods (eg, a long fio
run) we still need to allow some demotions and promotions to occur.

To achieve this, pass @idle=true to queue_promotion()'s
free_target_met() call so that free_target_met() doesn't short-circuit
the possibility of demotion simply because it isn't an idle period.
