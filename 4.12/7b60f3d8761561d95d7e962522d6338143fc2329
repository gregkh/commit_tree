ftrace: Dynamically create the probe ftrace_ops for the trace_array

In order to eventually have each trace_array instance have its own unique
set of function probes (triggers), the trace array needs to hold the ops and
the filters for the probes.

This is the first step to accomplish this. Instead of having the private
data of the probe ops point to the trace_array, create a separate list that
the trace_array holds. There's only one private_data for a probe, we need
one per trace_array. The probe ftrace_ops will be dynamically created for
each instance, instead of being static.
