pstore: Use dynamic spinlock initializer

The per-prz spinlock should be using the dynamic initializer so that
lockdep can correctly track it. Without this, under lockdep, we get a
warning at boot that the lock is in non-static memory.

Fixes: 109704492ef6 ("pstore: Make spinlock per zone instead of global")
Fixes: 76d5692a5803 ("pstore: Correctly initialize spinlock and flags")
