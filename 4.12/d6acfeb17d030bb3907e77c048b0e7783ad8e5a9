vxlan: vxlan dev should inherit lowerdev's gso_max_size

vxlan dev currently ignores lowerdev's gso_max_size, which adversely
affects TSO performance of liquidio if it's the lowerdev.  Egress TCP
packets' skb->len often exceed liquidio's advertised gso_max_size.  This
may happen on other NIC drivers.

Fix it by assigning lowerdev's gso_max_size to that of vxlan dev.  Might as
well do likewise for gso_max_segs.

Single flow TSO throughput of liquidio as lowerdev (using iperf3):

    Before the patch:    139 Mbps
    After the patch :   8.68 Gbps
    Percent increase:  6,144 %
