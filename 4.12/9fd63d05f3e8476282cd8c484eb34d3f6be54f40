bpf: Allow bpf sample programs (*_user.c) to change bpf_map_def

The current bpf_map_def is statically defined during compile
time.  This patch allows the *_user.c program to change it during
runtime.  It is done by adding load_bpf_file_fixup_map() which
takes a callback.  The callback will be called before creating
each map so that it has a chance to modify the bpf_map_def.

The current usecase is to change max_entries in map_perf_test.
It is interesting to test with a much bigger map size in
some cases (e.g. the following patch on bpf_lru_map.c).
However,  it is hard to find one size to fit all testing
environment.  Hence, it is handy to take the max_entries
as a cmdline arg and then configure the bpf_map_def during
runtime.

This patch adds two cmdline args.  One is to configure
the map's max_entries.  Another is to configure the max_cnt
which controls how many times a syscall is called.
