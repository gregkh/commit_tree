i40e: allow changing input set for ntuple filters

Add support to detect when we can update the input set for each flow
type.

Because the hardware only supports a single input set for all flows of
that matching type, the driver shall only allow the input set to change
if there are no other configured filters for that flow type.

Thus, the first filter added for each flow type is allowed to change the
input set, and all future filters must match the same input set. Display
a diagnostic message whenever the filter input set changes, and
a warning whenever a filter cannot be accepted because it does not match
the configured input set.
