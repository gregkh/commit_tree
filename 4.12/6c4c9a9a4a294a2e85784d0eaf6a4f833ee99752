power: supply: axp288_charger: Only wait for INT3496 device if present

On some devices with an axp288 pmic setting vbus path based on the
id-pin is handled by an ACPI _AIE interrupt on the gpio and the
INT3496 device is disabled.

Instead of returning -EPROBE_DEFER on these devices waiting for the
never to show up INT3496 device, check for its presence and only
request and monitor the matching extcon if the device is there,
otherwise let the firmware handle the vbus path control.
