arm64: KVM: Allow the main HYP code to use the init hyp stub implementation

We now have a full hyp-stub implementation in the KVM init code,
but the main KVM code only supports HVC_GET_VECTORS, which is not
enough.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, let's reuse the init implementation
by branching to the idmap page when called with a hyp-stub hypercall.
