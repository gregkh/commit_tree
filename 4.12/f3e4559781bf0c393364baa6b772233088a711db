x86/syscalls/32: Ignore arch_prctl for other architectures

sys_arch_prctl is only provided on x86, and there is no reason
to add it elsewhere. However, including it on the 32-bit syscall
table caused a warning for most configurations on non-x86:

:1328:2: warning: #warning syscall arch_prctl not implemented [-Wcpp]

This adds an exception to the syscall table checking script.
