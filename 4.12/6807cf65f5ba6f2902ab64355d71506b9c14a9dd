x86/xen: use capabilities instead of fake cpuid values for xsave

When running as pv domain xen_cpuid() is being used instead of
native_cpuid(). In xen_cpuid() the xsave feature availability is
indicated by special casing the related cpuid leaf.

Instead of delivering fake cpuid values set or clear the cpu
capability bits for xsave instead.
