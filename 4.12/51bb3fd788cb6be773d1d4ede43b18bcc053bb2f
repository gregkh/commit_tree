[media] staging: lirc_sasem: remove

This driver was merged in 2010 and never had the necessary work done
to promote it out of staging (port to rc-core), so remove it.

I have not managed to track down the hardware. If anyone has the
hardware and would like a driver for it, please contact me and
hopefully we can work together to write a new driver.
