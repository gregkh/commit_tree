xfs: don't allow bmap on rt files

bmap returns a dumb LBA address but not the block device that goes with
that LBA.  Swapfiles don't care about this and will blindly assume that
the data volume is the correct blockdev, which is totally bogus for
files on the rt subvolume.  This results in the swap code doing IOs to
arbitrary locations on the data device(!) if the passed in mapping is a
realtime file, so just turn off bmap for rt files.
