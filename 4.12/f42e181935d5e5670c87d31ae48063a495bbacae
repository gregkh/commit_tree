drm/gem: Add DEFINE_DRM_GEM_FOPS

Sadly there's only 1 driver which can use it, everyone else is special
for some reason:

- gma500 has a horrible runtime PM ioctl wrapper that probably doesn't
  really work but meh.
- i915 needs special compat_ioctl handler because regrets.
- arcgpu needs to fixup the pgprot because (no idea why it can't do
  that in the fault handler like everyone else).
- tegra does even worse stuff with pgprot
- udl does something with vm_flags too ...
- cma helpers, etnaviv, mtk, msm, rockchip, omap all implement some
  variation on prefaulting.
- exynos is exynos, I got lost in the midlayers.
- vc4 has to reinvent half of cma helpers because those are too much
  midlayer, plus vm_flags dances.
- vgem also seems unhappy with the default vm_flags.

So pretty sad divergence and I'm sure we could do better, but not
really an idea. Oh well, maybe this macro here helps to encourage more
consistency at least going forward.
