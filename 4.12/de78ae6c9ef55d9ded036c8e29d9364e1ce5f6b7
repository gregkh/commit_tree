powerpc/xmon: add debugfs entry for xmon

Currently the xmon debugger is set only via kernel boot command-line.
It's disabled by default, and can be enabled with "xmon=on" on the
command-line. Also, xmon may be accessed via sysrq mechanism.
But we cannot enable/disable xmon in runtime, it needs kernel reload.

This patch introduces a debugfs entry for xmon, allowing user to query
its current state and change it if desired. Basically, the "xmon" file
to read from/write to is under the debugfs mount point, on powerpc
directory. It's a simple attribute, value 0 meaning xmon is disabled
and value 1 the opposite. Writing these states to the file will take
immediate effect in the debugger.
