md/raid10: simplify handle_read_error()

handle_read_error() duplicates a lot of the work that raid10_read_request()
does, so it makes sense to just use that function.

handle_read_error() relies on the same r10bio being re-used so that,
in the case of a read-only array, setting IO_BLOCKED in r1bio->devs[].bio
ensures read_balance() won't re-use that device.
So when called from raid10_make_request() we clear that array, but not
when called from handle_read_error().

Two parts of handle_read_error() that need to be preserved are the warning
message it prints, so they are conditionally added to
raid10_read_request().  If the failing rdev can be found, messages
are printed.  Otherwise they aren't.

Not that as rdev_dec_pending() has already been called on the failing
rdev, we need to use rcu_read_lock() to get a new reference from
the conf.  We only use this to get the name of the failing block device.

With this change, we no longer need inc_pending().
