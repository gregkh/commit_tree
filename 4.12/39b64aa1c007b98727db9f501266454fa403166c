cpufreq: schedutil: Reduce frequencies slower

The schedutil governor reduces frequencies too fast in some
situations which cases undesirable performance drops to
appear.

To address that issue, make schedutil reduce the frequency slower by
setting it to the average of the value chosen during the previous
iteration of governor computations and the new one coming from its
frequency selection formula.
