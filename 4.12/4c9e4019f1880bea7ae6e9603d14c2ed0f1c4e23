blk-mq: Let blk_mq_debugfs_register() look up the queue name

A later patch will move the call of blk_mq_debugfs_register() to
a function to which the queue name is not passed as an argument.
To avoid having to add a 'name' argument to multiple callers, let
blk_mq_debugfs_register() look up the queue name.
