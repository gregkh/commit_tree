Revert "block: use DAX for partition table reads"

commit d1a5f2b4d8a1 ("block: use DAX for partition table reads") was
part of a stalled effort to allow dax mappings of block devices. Since
then the device-dax mechanism has filled the role of dax-mapping static
device ranges.

Now that we are moving ->direct_access() from a block_device operation
to a dax_inode operation we would need block devices to map and carry
their own dax_inode reference.

Unless / until we decide to revive dax mapping of raw block devices
through the dax_inode scheme, there is no need to carry
read_dax_sector(). Its removal in turn allows for the removal of
bdev_direct_access() and should have been included in commit
223757016837 ("block_dev: remove DAX leftovers").
