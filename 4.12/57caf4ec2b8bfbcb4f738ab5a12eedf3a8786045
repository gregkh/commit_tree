cpufreq: intel_pstate: Avoid division by 0 in min_perf_pct_min()

Commit c5a2ee7dde89 (cpufreq: intel_pstate: Active mode P-state
limits rework) incorrectly assumed that pstate.turbo_pstate would
always be nonzero for CPU0 in min_perf_pct_min() if
cpufreq_register_driver() had succeeded which may not be the case
in virtualized environments.

If that assumption doesn't hold, it leads to an early crash on boot
in intel_pstate_register_driver(), so add a sanity check to
min_perf_pct_min() to prevent the crash from happening.
