ASoC: sgtl5000: Allow LRCLK pad drive strength to be changed

Introduce the "lrclk-strength" property to allow LRCLK pad drive strength
to be changed via device tree.

When running a stress playback loop test on a mx6dl wandboard channel
swap can be noticed on about 10% of the times.

While debugging this issue I noticed that when probing the SGTL5000
LRCLK pin with the scope the swap did not happen. After removing
the probe the swap started to happen again.

After changing the LRCLK pad drive strength to the maximum value the
issue is gone.

Same fix works on a mx6dl Colibri board as well.
