nfp: add port state refresh

We will need a way of refreshing port state for link settings
get/set.  For get we need to refresh port speed and type.

When settings are changed the reconfiguration may require
reboot before it's effective.  Unregister netdevs affected
by reconfiguration from a workqueue.
