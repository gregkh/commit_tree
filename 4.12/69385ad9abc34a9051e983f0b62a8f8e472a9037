staging: lustre: Replace typedef with struct

As per the Linux kernel coding style guidelines, using typedef for a
structure type is not recommended. Hence, occurences of typedefs have
been removed. To find the occurences of the structures grep was used
and no uses were found.

Coccinelle script:

@r1@
type T;
@@

typedef struct { ... } T;

@script:python c1@
T2;
T << r1.T;
@@
coccinelle.T2=T;

@@
type r1.T;
identifier c1.T2;
@@
-typedef
struct
+ T2
{ ... }
-T
;
