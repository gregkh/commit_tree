staging: atomisp: remove useless condition in if-statements

The css_pipe_id was checked with 'CSS_PIPE_ID_COPY' in previous if-
statement. In this case, if the css_pipe_id equals to 'CSS_PIPE_ID_COPY',
it could not enter the next if-statement. But the "next" if-statement
has the condition to check whether the css_pipe_id equals to
'CSS_PIPE_ID_COPY' or not. It should be removed.
