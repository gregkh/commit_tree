scsi: qla2xxx: Fix extraneous ref on sp's after adapter break

Hung task timeouts can result if a qlogic board breaks unexpectedly
while running I/O. These tasks become hung because command srb reference
counts are not going to zero, hence the affected srbs and commands do
not get freed. This fix accounts for this extra reference in the srbs in
the case of a board failure.
