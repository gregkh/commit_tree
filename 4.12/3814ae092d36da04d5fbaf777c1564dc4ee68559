clocksource: em_sti: Split clock prepare and enable steps

Currently, the em_sti driver prepares and enables the needed clock in
em_sti_enable(), potentially called through its clockevent device's
->set_state_oneshot().

However, the clk_prepare() step may sleep whereas tick_program_event() and
thus, ->set_state_oneshot(), can be called in atomic context.

Split the clk_prepare_enable() in em_sti_enable() into two steps:
- prepare the clock at device probing via clk_prepare()
- and enable it in em_sti_enable() via clk_enable().
Slightly reorder resource initialization in em_sti_probe() in order to
facilitate error handling in later patches.
