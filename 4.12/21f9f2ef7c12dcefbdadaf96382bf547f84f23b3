[media] Staging: media/lirc: don't call put_ir_rx on rx twice

There is an exit path where rx is kfree'd on put_ir_rx and then
a jump to label out_put_xx will again kfree it with another
call to put_ir_rx.  Fix this by adding a new label that avoids
this 2nd call to put_ir_rx for this specific case.
