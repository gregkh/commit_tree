net: ena: fix bug that might cause hang after consecutive open/close interface.

Fixing a bug that the driver does not unmask the IO interrupts
in ndo_open():
occasionally, the MSI-X interrupt (for one or more IO queues)
can be masked when ndo_close() was called.
If that is followed by ndo open(),
then the MSI-X will be still masked so no interrupt
will be received by the driver.
