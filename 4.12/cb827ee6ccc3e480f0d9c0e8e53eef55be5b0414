ntb_transport: fix qp count bug

In cases where there are more mw's than spads/2-2, the mw count gets
reduced to match the limitation. ntb_transport also tries to ensure that
there are fewer qps than mws but uses the full mw count instead of
the reduced one. When this happens, the math in
'ntb_transport_setup_qp_mw' will get confused and result in a kernel
paging request bug.

This patch fixes the bug by reducing qp_count to the reduced mw count
instead of the full mw count.
