Input: psmouse - add support for SMBus companions

This provides glue between PS/2 devices that enumerate the RMI4 devices
and Elan touchpads to the RMI4 (or Elan) SMBus driver.

The SMBus devices keep their PS/2 connection alive. If the initialization
process goes too far (psmouse_activate called), the device disconnects
from the I2C bus and stays on the PS/2 bus, that is why we explicitly
disable PS/2 device reporting (by calling psmouse_deactivate) before
trying to register SMBus companion device.

The HID over I2C devices are enumerated through the ACPI DSDT, and
their PS/2 device also exports the InterTouch bit in the extended
capability 0x0C. However, the firmware keeps its I2C connection open
even after going further in the PS/2 initialization. We don't need
to take extra precautions with those device, especially because they
block their PS/2 communication when HID over I2C is used.
