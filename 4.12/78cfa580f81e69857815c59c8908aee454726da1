drm/i915/glk: Apply cdclk workaround for DP audio

Implement the DP-Audio cdclk restriction for GLK, similar to what is
implemented for BDW and other GEN9 platforms. The max. pixel clock
adjustment for GLK, however factors in the 2 pixels per clock output that
GLK generates.

Separating min. cdclk and max. pixel_rate would be nicer, but let's
defer that to future and fix the GLK bug for now.
