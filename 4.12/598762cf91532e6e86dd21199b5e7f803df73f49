perf test: Disable breakpoint signal tests for powerpc

The following tests are failing on powerpc:

  # perf test break
  18: Breakpoint overflow signal handler  : FAILED!
  19: Breakpoint overflow sampling        : FAILED!

The powerpc kenel so far does not have support to even create
instruction breakpoints using the perf event interface, so those tests
fail early in the config phase.

I added a '->is_supported()' callback to test struct to be able to
disable specific tests. It seems better than putting ifdefs directly to
the test array.
