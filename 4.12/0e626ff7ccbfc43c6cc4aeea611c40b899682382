i40e: Fix support for flow director programming status

This patch fixes an issue I introduced when I converted the code over to
using the length field to determine if a descriptor was done or not. It
turns out that we are also processing programming descriptors in the Rx
path and need to have these processed even though the length field will be
0 on these packets.  What will happen with a programming descriptor is that
we will receive a descriptor that has the SPH bit set, and the header
length and packet length fields cleared.

To account for this we should be checking for the bit for split header
being set even though we aren't actually using header split. This bit is
set in the length field to indicate if a programming descriptor response is
contained in the descriptor. Since we don't support header split we don't
need to perform the extra checks of using a fixed value for the entire
length field.

In addition I am moving the function for checking if a filter is a
programming status filter into the i40e_txrx.c file since there is no
longer support for FCoE it doesn't make sense to keep this file in i40e.h.
