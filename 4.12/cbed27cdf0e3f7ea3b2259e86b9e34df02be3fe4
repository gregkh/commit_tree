x86/PAT: Fix Xorg regression on CPUs that don't support PAT

In the file arch/x86/mm/pat.c, there's a '__pat_enabled' variable. The
variable is set to 1 by default and the function pat_init() sets
__pat_enabled to 0 if the CPU doesn't support PAT.

However, on AMD K6-3 CPUs, the processor initialization code never calls
pat_init() and so __pat_enabled stays 1 and the function pat_enabled()
returns true, even though the K6-3 CPU doesn't support PAT.

The result of this bug is that a kernel warning is produced when attempting to
start the Xserver and the Xserver doesn't start (fork() returns ENOMEM).
Another symptom of this bug is that the framebuffer driver doesn't set the
K6-3 MTRR registers:

  x86/PAT: Xorg:3891 map pfn expected mapping type uncached-minus for [mem 0xe4000000-0xe5ffffff], got write-combining
  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3891 at arch/x86/mm/pat.c:1020 untrack_pfn+0x5c/0x9f
  ...
  x86/PAT: Xorg:3891 map pfn expected mapping type uncached-minus for [mem 0xe4000000-0xe5ffffff], got write-combining

To fix the bug change pat_enabled() so that it returns true only if PAT
initialization was actually done.

Also, I changed boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_PAT) to
this_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_PAT) in pat_ap_init(), so that we check the PAT
feature on the processor that is being initialized.
