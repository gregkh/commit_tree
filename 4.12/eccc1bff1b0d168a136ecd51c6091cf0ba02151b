arm64/mmu: ignore debug_pagealloc for kernel segments

The debug_pagealloc facility manipulates kernel mappings in the linear
region at page granularity to detect out of bounds or use-after-free
accesses. Since the kernel segments are not allocated dynamically,
there is no point in taking the debug_pagealloc_enabled flag into
account for them, and we can use block mappings unconditionally.

Note that this applies equally to the linear alias of text/rodata:
we will never have dynamic allocations there given that the same
memory is statically in use by the kernel image.
