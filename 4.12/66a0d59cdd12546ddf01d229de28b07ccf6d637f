scsi: ipr: Fix missed EH wakeup

Following a command abort or device reset, ipr's EH handlers wait for
the commands getting aborted to get sent back from the adapter prior to
returning from the EH handler. This fixes up some cases where the
completion handler was not getting called, which would have resulted in
the EH thread waiting until it timed out, greatly extending EH time.
