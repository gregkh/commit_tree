i40e: return immediately when failing to add fdir filter

Instead of setting err=true and checking this to determine when to free
the raw_packet near the end of the function, simply kfree and return
immediately. The resulting code is a bit cleaner and has one less
variable. This also resolves a subtle bug in the ipv4 case which could
fail to add the first filter and then never free the memory, resulting
in a small memory leak.
