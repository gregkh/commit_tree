net: Busy polling should ignore sender CPUs

This patch is a cleanup/fix for NAPI IDs following the changes that made it
so that sender_cpu and napi_id were doing a better job of sharing the same
location in the sk_buff.

One issue I found is that we weren't validating the napi_id as being valid
before we started trying to setup the busy polling.  This change corrects
that by using the MIN_NAPI_ID value that is now used in both allocating the
NAPI IDs, as well as validating them.
