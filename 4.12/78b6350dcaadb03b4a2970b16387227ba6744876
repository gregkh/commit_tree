md: support disabling of create-on-open semantics.

md allows a new array device to be created by simply
opening a device file.  This make it difficult to
remove the device and udev is likely to open the device file
as part of processing the REMOVE event.

There is an alternate mechanism for creating arrays
by writing to the new_array module parameter.
When using tools that work with this parameter, it is
best to disable the old semantics.
This new module parameter allows that.
