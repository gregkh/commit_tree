drivers/perf: arm_pmu: split out platform device probe logic

Now that we've split the pdev and DT probing logic from the runtime
management, let's move the former into its own file. We gain a few lines
due to the copyright header and includes, but this should keep the logic
clearly separated, and paves the way for adding ACPI support in a
similar fashion.
