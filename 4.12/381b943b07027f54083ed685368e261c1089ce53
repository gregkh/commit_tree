drm/i915: Remove i915_address_space.start

Once upon a time, back in the UMS days, we supported userspace
initialising the GTT and sharing portions of the GTT with other users.
Now, we own the GTT (both global and per-process) and the tables always
start at 0 - so we can remove i915_address_space.start and forget about
this old complication.
