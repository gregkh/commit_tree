staging: comedi: jr3_pci: cope with jiffies wraparound

The timer expiry routine `jr3_pci_poll_dev()` checks for expiry by
checking whether the absolute value of `jiffies` (stored in local
variable `now`) is greater than the expected expiry time in jiffy units.
This will fail when `jiffies` wraps around.  Also, it seems to make
sense to handle the expiry one jiffy earlier than the current test.  Use
`time_after_eq()` to check for expiry.
