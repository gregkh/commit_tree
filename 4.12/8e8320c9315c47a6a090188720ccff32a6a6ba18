blk-mq: fix performance regression with shared tags

If we have shared tags enabled, then every IO completion will trigger
a full loop of every queue belonging to a tag set, and every hardware
queue for each of those queues, even if nothing needs to be done.
This causes a massive performance regression if you have a lot of
shared devices.

Instead of doing this huge full scan on every IO, add an atomic
counter to the main queue that tracks how many hardware queues have
been marked as needing a restart. With that, we can avoid looking for
restartable queues, if we don't have to.

Max reports that this restores performance. Before this patch, 4K
IOPS was limited to 22-23K IOPS. With the patch, we are running at
950-970K IOPS.
