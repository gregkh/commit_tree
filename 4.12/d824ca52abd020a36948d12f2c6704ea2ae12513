arm/arm64: Add hyp-stub API documentation

In order to help people understanding the hyp-stub API that exists
between the host kernel and the hypervisor mode (whether a hypervisor
has been installed or not), let's document said API.

As with any form of documentation, I expect it to become obsolete
and completely misleading within 20 minutes after having being merged.
