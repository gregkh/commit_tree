drm: armada: use vblank hooks in struct drm_crtc_funcs

The vblank hooks in struct drm_driver are deprecated and only meant for
legacy drivers.  For modern drivers with DRIVER_MODESET flag, the hooks
in struct drm_crtc_funcs should be used instead.  As the result,
functions armada_drm_crtc_enable[disable]_irq() can be static, although
they are moved around a bit to save forward declaration.

The armada_crtc pointer array in struct armada_private is still kept in
there, because armada_debugfs.c still have reference to it.
