drm: ensure atomic messages consistently include the name of the component

Most DRM messages include three pieces of information: the type of the
component (CRTC, ENCODER, CONNECTOR etc), the DRM object ID of the
component, and the component name.  However, there are some messages
which omit the last piece of identifying information.  This makes it
harder to debug failures when these messages are printed, because the
DRM object ID doesn't supply enough information to know which piece of
hardware had a problem.

Update the atomic modeset code to always print the component name along
with the type and DRM object ID.
