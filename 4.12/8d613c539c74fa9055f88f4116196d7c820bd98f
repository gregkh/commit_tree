drm/i915: Always call i915_gem_reset_finish() following i915_gem_reset_prepare()

As i915_gem_reset_finish() undoes the steps from
i915_gem_reset_prepare() to leave the system in a fully-working state,
e.g. to be able to free the breadcrumb signal threads, make sure that we
always call it even on the error path.
