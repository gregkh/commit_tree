   iscsi-target: Add sk->sk_state_change to cleanup after TCP failure

which would trigger a NULL pointer dereference when a TCP connection
was closed asynchronously via iscsi_target_sk_state_change(), but only
when the initial PDU processing in iscsi_target_do_login() from iscsi_np
process context was blocked waiting for backend I/O to complete.

To address this issue, this patch makes the following changes.

First, it introduces some common helper functions used for checking
socket closing state, checking login_flags, and atomically checking
socket closing state + setting login_flags.

Second, it introduces a LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU bit to know when a TCP
connection has dropped via iscsi_target_sk_state_change(), but the
initial PDU processing within iscsi_target_do_login() in iscsi_np
context is still running.  For this case, it sets LOGIN_FLAGS_CLOSED,
but doesn't invoke schedule_delayed_work().

The original NULL pointer dereference case reported by MNC is now handled
by iscsi_target_do_login() doing a iscsi_target_sk_check_close() before
transitioning to FFP to determine when the socket has already closed,
or iscsi_target_start_negotiation() if the login needs to exchange
more PDUs (eg: iscsi_target_do_login returned 0) but the socket has
closed.  For both of these cases, the cleanup up of remaining connection
resources will occur in iscsi_target_start_negotiation() from iscsi_np
process context once the failure is detected.

Finally, to handle to case where iscsi_target_sk_state_change() is
called after the initial PDU procesing is complete, it now invokes
conn->login_work -> iscsi_target_do_login_rx() to perform cleanup once
existing iscsi_target_sk_check_close() checks detect connection failure.
For this case, the cleanup of remaining connection resources will occur
in iscsi_target_do_login_rx() from delayed workqueue process context
once the failure is detected.
