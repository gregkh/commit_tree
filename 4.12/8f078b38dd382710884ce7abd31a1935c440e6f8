libnvdimm: convert NDD_ flags to use bitops, introduce NDD_LOCKED

This is a preparation patch for handling locked nvdimm label regions, a
new concept as introduced by the latest DSM document on pmem.io [1]. A
future patch will leverage nvdimm_set_locked() at DIMM probe time to
flag regions that can not be enabled. There should be no functional
difference resulting from this change.
