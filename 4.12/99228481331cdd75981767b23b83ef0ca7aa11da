ARM: davinci: add pdata-quirks for da850-evm vpif display

Similarly to vpif capture: we need to register the vpif display driver
and the corresponding adv7343 encoder in pdata-quirks as the DT
support is not complete - there isn't currently a way to define the
output_routing in the V4L2 drivers (c.f. s_routing) via DT.
