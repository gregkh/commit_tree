ubifs: Add CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_SECURITY to disable/enable security labels

When write syscall is called, every time security label is searched to
determine that file's privileges should be changed.
If LSM(Linux Security Model) is not used, this is useless.

So introduce CONFIG_UBIFS_SECURITY to disable security labels. it's default
value is "y".
