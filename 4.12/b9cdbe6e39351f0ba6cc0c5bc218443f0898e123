ARM: Implement pci_remap_cfgspace() interface

The PCI bus specification (rev 3.0, 3.2.5 "Transaction Ordering and
Posting") defines rules for PCI configuration space transactions ordering
and posting, that state that configuration writes have to be non-posted
transactions.

Current ioremap interface on ARM provides mapping functions that provide
"bufferable" writes transactions (ie ioremap uses MT_DEVICE memory type)
aka posted writes, so PCI host controller drivers have no arch interface to
remap PCI configuration space with memory attributes that comply with the
PCI specifications for configuration space.

Implement an ARM specific pci_remap_cfgspace() interface that allows to map
PCI config memory regions with MT_UNCACHED memory type (ie strongly ordered
- non-posted writes), providing a remap function that complies with PCI
specifications for config space transactions.
