arm64: Fix the DMA mmap and get_sgtable API with DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS

While honouring the DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS on arm64 (commit
44176bb38fa4: "arm64: Add support for DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS to
IOMMU"), the existing uses of dma_mmap_attrs() and dma_get_sgtable()
have been broken by passing a physically contiguous vm_struct with an
invalid pages pointer through the common iommu API.

Since the coherent allocation with DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS uses CMA,
this patch simply reuses the existing swiotlb logic for mmap and
get_sgtable.

Note that the current implementation of get_sgtable (both swiotlb and
iommu) is broken if dma_declare_coherent_memory() is used since such
memory does not have a corresponding struct page. To be addressed in a
subsequent patch.
