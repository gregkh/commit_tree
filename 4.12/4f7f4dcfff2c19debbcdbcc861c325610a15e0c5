infiniband/uverbs: Fix integer overflows

The 'num_sge' variable is verfied to be smaller than the 'sge_count'
variable; however, since both are user-controlled it's possible to cause
an integer overflow for the kmalloc multiply on 32-bit platforms
(num_sge and sge_count are both defined u32). By crafting an input that
causes a smaller-than-expected allocation it's possible to write
controlled data out-of-bounds.
