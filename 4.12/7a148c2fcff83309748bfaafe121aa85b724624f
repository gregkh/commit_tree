block: don't call blk_mq_quiesce_queue() after queue is frozen

After queue is frozen, no request in this queue can be in use at all, so
there can't be any .queue_rq() running on this queue.  It isn't
necessary to call blk_mq_quiesce_queue() any more, so remove it in both
elevator_switch_mq() and blk_mq_update_nr_requests().
