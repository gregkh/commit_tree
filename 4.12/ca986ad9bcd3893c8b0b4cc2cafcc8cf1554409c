nl80211: allow multiple active scheduled scan requests

This patch implements the idea to have multiple scheduled scan requests
running concurrently. It mainly illustrates how to deal with the incoming
request from user-space in terms of backward compatibility. In order to
use multiple scheduled scans user-space needs to provide a flag attribute
NL80211_ATTR_SCHED_SCAN_MULTI to indicate support. If not the request is
treated as a legacy scan.

Drivers currently supporting scheduled scan are now indicating they support
a single scheduled scan request. This obsoletes WIPHY_FLAG_SUPPORTS_SCHED_SCAN.
