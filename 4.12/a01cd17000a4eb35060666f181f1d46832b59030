Input: soc_button_array - use NULL for GPIO connection ID

The gpiolib-acpi code is becoming more strict and connection-IDs
may only be used with devices which have a _DSD with matching IDs
in there. Since the soc_button_array ACPI binding is pure index
based pass in NULL as connection-ID to avoid the more strict cheks
resulting in gpiod_count and gpiod_get_index not returning any gpios.
