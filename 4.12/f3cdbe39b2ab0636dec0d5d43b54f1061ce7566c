tcmu: fix crash during device removal

We currently do

tcmu_free_device ->tcmu_netlink_event(TCMU_CMD_REMOVED_DEVICE) ->
uio_unregister_device -> kfree(tcmu_dev).

The problem is that the kernel does not wait for userspace to
do the close() on the uio device before freeing the tcmu_dev.
We can then hit a race where the kernel frees the tcmu_dev before
userspace does close() and so when close() -> release -> tcmu_release
is done, we try to access a freed tcmu_dev.

This patch made over the target-pending master branch moves the freeing
of the tcmu_dev to when the last reference has been dropped.

This also fixes a leak where if tcmu_configure_device was not called on a
device we did not free udev->name which was allocated at tcmu_alloc_device time.
