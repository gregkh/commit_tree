zram: reduce load operation in page_same_filled

In page_same_filled function, all elements in the page is compared with
next index value.  The current comparison routine compares the (i)th and
(i+1)th values of the page.

In this case, two load operaions occur for each comparison.  But if we
store first value of the page stores at 'val' variable and using it to
compare with others, the load opearation is reduced.  It reduce load
operation per page by up to 64times.
