drm/nouveau/tmr: avoid processing completed alarms when adding a new one

The idea here was to avoid having to "manually" program the HW if there's
a new earliest alarm.  This was lazy and bad, as it leads to loads of fun
races between inter-related callers (ie. therm).

Turns out, it's not so difficult after all.  Go figure ;)
