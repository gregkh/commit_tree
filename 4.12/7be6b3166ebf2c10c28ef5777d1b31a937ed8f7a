perf tools: Pass PYTHON config to feature detection

( This is a rebased version of https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/7/662 )

Python's CC and link Makefile variables were not passed to feature
detection, causing feature detection to use system's Python rather than
PYTHON_CONFIG's one. This created a mismatch between the detected Python
support and the one actually used by perf when PYTHON_CONFIG is
specified.

Fix it by moving Python's variable initialization to before feature
detection and pass FLAGS_PYTHON_EMBED to Python's feature detection's
build target.
