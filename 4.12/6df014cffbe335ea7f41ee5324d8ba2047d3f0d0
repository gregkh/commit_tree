Enable tx timestamping on loopback and dummy

This enables developing code that uses SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE
by using localhost addresses (without needing to send packets outside),
as well as enabling unit and functional testing of TX timestamping code
without needing hardware support or network access.

It also fulfills the expectation of software network devices supporting
software-based timestamping.

Tested on qemu using txtimestamping.c from the kernel selftests, and
ethtool -T.
