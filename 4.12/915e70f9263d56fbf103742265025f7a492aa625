staging, android: remove lowmemory killer from the tree

Lowmemory killer is sitting in the staging tree since 2008 without any
serious interest for fixing issues brought up by the MM folks. The main
objection is that the implementation is basically broken by design:
	- it hooks into slab shrinker API which is not suitable for this
	  purpose. lowmem_count implementation just shows this nicely.
	  There is no scaling based on the memory pressure and no
	  feedback to the generic shrinker infrastructure.
	  Moreover lowmem_scan is called way too often for the heavy
	  work it performs.
	- it is not reclaim context aware - no NUMA and/or memcg
	  awareness.

As the code stands right now it just adds a maintenance overhead when
core MM changes have to update lowmemorykiller.c as well. It also seems
that the alternative LMK implementation will be solely in the userspace
so this code has no perspective it seems. The staging tree is supposed
to be for a code which needs to be put in shape before it can be merged
which is not the case here obviously.
