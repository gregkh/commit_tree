Input: synaptics-rmi4 - only read the F54 query registers which are used

The F54 driver is currently only using the first 6 bytes of F54 so there is
no need to read all 27 bytes. Some Dell systems (Dell XP13 9333 and
similar) have an issue with the touchpad or I2C bus when reading reports
larger then 16 bytes. Reads larger then 16 bytes are reported in two HID
reports. Something about the back to back reports seems to cause the next
read to report incorrect data. This results in F30 failing to load and the
click button failing to work.

Previous issues with the I2C controller or touchpad were addressed in:
commit 5b65c2a02966 ("HID: rmi: check sanity of the incoming report")
