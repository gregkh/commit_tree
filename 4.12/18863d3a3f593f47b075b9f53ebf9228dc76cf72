mm: remove SWAP_DIRTY in ttu

If we found lazyfree page is dirty, try_to_unmap_one can just
SetPageSwapBakced in there like PG_mlocked page and just return with
SWAP_FAIL which is very natural because the page is not swappable right
now so that vmscan can activate it.  There is no point to introduce new
return value SWAP_DIRTY in try_to_unmap at the moment.
