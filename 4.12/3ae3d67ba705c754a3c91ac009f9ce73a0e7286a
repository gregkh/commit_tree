libnvdimm: add an atomic vs process context flag to rw_bytes

nsio_rw_bytes can clear media errors, but this cannot be done while we
are in an atomic context due to locking within ACPI. From the BTT,
->rw_bytes may be called either from atomic or process context depending
on whether the calls happen during initialization or during IO.

During init, we want to ensure error clearing happens, and the flag
marking process context allows nsio_rw_bytes to do that. When called
during IO, we're in atomic context, and error clearing can be skipped.
