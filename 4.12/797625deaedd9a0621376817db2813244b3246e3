cxl: Fixes for Coherent Accelerator Interface Architecture 2.0

A previous set of patches "cxl: Add support for Coherent Accelerator
Interface Architecture 2.0" has introduced a new support for the CAPI
cards. These patches have been tested on Simulation environment and
quite a bit of them have been tested on real hardware.

This patch brings new fixes after a series of tests carried out on new
equipment:
  - Add POWER9 definition.
  - Re-enable any masked interrupts when the AFU is not activated
    after resetting the AFU.
  - Remove the api cxl_is_psl8/9 which is no longer useful.
  - Do not dump CAPI1 registers.
  - Rewrite cxl_is_page_fault() function.
  - Do not register slb callack on P9.
