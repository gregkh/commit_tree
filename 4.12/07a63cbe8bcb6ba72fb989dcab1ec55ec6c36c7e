s390/cputime: fix incorrect system time

git commit c5328901aa1db134 "[S390] entry[64].S improvements" removed
the update of the exit_timer lowcore field from the critical section
cleanup of the .Lsysc_restore/.Lsysc_done and .Lio_restore/.Lio_done
blocks. If the PSW is updated by the critical section cleanup to point to
user space again, the interrupt entry code will do a vtime calculation
after the cleanup completed with an exit_timer value which has *not* been
updated. Due to this incorrect system time deltas are calculated.

If an interrupt occured with an old PSW between .Lsysc_restore/.Lsysc_done
or .Lio_restore/.Lio_done update __LC_EXIT_TIMER with the system entry
time of the interrupt.
