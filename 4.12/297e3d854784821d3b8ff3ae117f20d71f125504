blk-throttle: make throtl_slice tunable

throtl_slice is important for blk-throttling. It's called slice
internally but it really is a time window blk-throttling samples data.
blk-throttling will make decision based on the samplings. An example is
bandwidth measurement. A cgroup's bandwidth is measured in the time
interval of throtl_slice.

A small throtl_slice meanse cgroups have smoother throughput but burn
more CPUs. It has 100ms default value, which is not appropriate for all
disks. A fast SSD can dispatch a lot of IOs in 100ms. This patch makes
it tunable.

Since throtl_slice isn't a time slice, the sysfs name
'throttle_sample_time' reflects its character better.
