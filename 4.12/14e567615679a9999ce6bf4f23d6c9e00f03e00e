netfilter: ctnetlink: drop the incorrect cthelper module request

First, when creating a new ct, we will invoke request_module to try to
load the related inkernel cthelper. So there's no need to call the
request_module again when updating the ct helpinfo.

Second, ctnetlink_change_helper may be called with rcu_read_lock held,
i.e. rcu_read_lock -> nfqnl_recv_verdict -> nfqnl_ct_parse ->
ctnetlink_glue_parse -> ctnetlink_glue_parse_ct ->
ctnetlink_change_helper. But the request_module invocation may sleep,
so we can't call it with the rcu_read_lock held.

Remove it now.
