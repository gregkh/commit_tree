KVM: s390: gs support for kvm guests

This patch adds guarded storage support for KVM guest. We need to
setup the necessary control blocks, the kvm_run structure for the
new registers, the necessary wrappers for VSIE, as well as the
machine check save areas.
GS is enabled lazily and the register saving and reloading is done in
KVM code.  As this feature adds new content for migration, we provide
a new capability for enablement (KVM_CAP_S390_GS).
