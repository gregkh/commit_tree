powerpc/powernv/idle: Don't override default/deepest directly in kernel

Currently during idle-init on power9, if we don't find suitable stop
states in the device tree that can be used as the
default_stop/deepest_stop, we set stop0 (ESL=1,EC=1) as the default
stop state psscr to be used by power9_idle and deepest stop state
which is used by CPU-Hotplug.

However, if the platform firmware has not configured or enabled a stop
state, the kernel should not make any assumptions and fallback to a
default choice.

If the kernel uses a stop state that is not configured by the platform
firmware, it may lead to further failures which should be avoided.

In this patch, we modify the init code to ensure that the kernel uses
only the stop states exposed by the firmware through the device
tree. When a suitable default stop state isn't found, we disable
ppc_md.power_save for power9. Similarly, when a suitable
deepest_stop_state is not found in the device tree exported by the
firmware, fall back to the default busy-wait loop in the CPU-Hotplug
code.
