MIPS: ftrace: fix init functions tracing

Since introduction of tracing for init functions the in_kernel_space()
check is no longer correct, as it ignores the init sections. As a
result, when probes are inserted (and disabled) in the init functions,
a branch instruction is inserted instead of a nop, which is likely to
result in random crashes during boot.

Remove the MIPS-specific in_kernel_space() method and replace it with a
generic core_kernel_text() that also checks for init sections during
system boot stage.
