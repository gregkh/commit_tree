[media] staging: sir: remove unselectable Tekram and Actisys

Support for these sir ports is not compiled in by default, it has to
be enabled by manually defining LIRC_TEKRAM, LIRC_SIR_ACTISYS_ACT200L
or LIRC_SIR_ACTISYS_ACT220L somewhere. This cannot be done from Kconfig
at all so remove them from the driver.
