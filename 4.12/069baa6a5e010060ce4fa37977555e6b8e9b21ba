staging: wilc1000: removes redundant 'continue' in while loop conditional blocks

Removing 6 continue statements from a while loop. The
continue statements are redundant here since control
already returns to the beginning of the loop upon exit
of any of the conditional blocks. Found using Coccinelle.
