drm/i915: struct_mutex is not required for allocating the framebuffer

We do not need the BKL struct_mutex in order to allocate a GEM object,
nor to create the framebuffer, so resist the temptation to take the BKL
willy nilly. As this changes the locking contract around internal API
calls, the patch is a little larger than a plain removal of a pair of
mutex_lock/unlock.
