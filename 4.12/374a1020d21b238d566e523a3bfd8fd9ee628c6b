usb: gadget: mv_u3d: fix error handling in mv_u3d_probe()

There are several inconsistencies in the error handling code.
1. If clk_get() fails, it goes to clk_put().
2. If pdata->phy_init() fails, it does not disable u3d->clk.
3. In case of failure after stopping u3d, it does pdata->phy_deinit()
   and clk_disable(u3d->clk) twice.
4. It ignores failures in clk_enable().
