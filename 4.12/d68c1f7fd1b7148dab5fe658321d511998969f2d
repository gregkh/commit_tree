arm64: KVM: Preserve RES1 bits in SCTLR_EL2

__do_hyp_init has the rather bad habit of ignoring RES1 bits and
writing them back as zero. On a v8.0-8.2 CPU, this doesn't do anything
bad, but may end-up being pretty nasty on future revisions of the
architecture.

Let's preserve those bits so that we don't have to fix this later on.
