Bluetooth: btrtl: Change message for missing config file

The message concerning missing config files for 8723b, 8821a, and
8761a should have been issued with BT_INFO() rather than BT_ERR() as
this condition is not fatal. After looking at that code, I have
reworked the logic to log such messages only if the device needs such a
config file. At the moment, only the 8822b fits that description.
