drm/doc: Document drm_file.[hc]

Well, mostly drm_file.h, and clean up all related things:

- I didnt' figure out the difference between preclose and postclose.
  The existing explanation in drm-internals.rst didn't convince me,
  since it's also really outdated - we clean up pending DRM events in
  the core nowadays. I put a FIXME in for the future.

- Another FIXME is to have a macro for default fops.

- Lots of links all around, main areas are to tie the overview in
  drm_file.c more into the callbacks in struct drm_device, and the
  other is to link render/primary node code to the right sections in
  drm-uapi.rst.

- Also moved the open/close stuff to drm_drv.h from drm-internals.rst,
  seems like the better place for that information. Since that section
  was rather outdated this amounted to full-on rewrite.

A big missing piece here is some overview graph, but I think better to
wait with that one until drm_device and drm_driver are also fully
documented.
