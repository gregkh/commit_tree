batman-adv: restructure rebroadcast counter into forw_packet API

This patch refactors the num_packets counter of a forw_packet in the
following three ways:

1) Removed dual-use of forw_packet::num_packets:
   -> now for aggregation purposes only
2) Using forw_packet::skb::cb::num_bcasts instead:
   -> for easier access in aggregation code later
3) make access to num_bcasts private to batadv_forw_packet_*()
