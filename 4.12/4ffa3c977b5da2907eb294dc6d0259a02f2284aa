x86/intel_rdt: Add cpus_list rdtgroup file

The resource control filesystem provides only a bitmask based cpus file for
assigning CPUs to a resource group. That's cumbersome with large cpumasks
and non-intuitive when modifying the file from the command line.

Range based cpu lists are commonly used along with bitmask based cpu files
in various subsystems throughout the kernel.

Add 'cpus_list' file which is CPU range based.

  # cd /sys/fs/resctrl/
  # echo 1-10 > krava/cpus_list
  # cat krava/cpus_list
  1-10
  # cat krava/cpus
  0007fe
  # cat cpus
  fffff9
  # cat cpus_list
  0,3-23

[ tglx: Massaged changelog and replaced "bitmask lists" by "CPU ranges" ]
