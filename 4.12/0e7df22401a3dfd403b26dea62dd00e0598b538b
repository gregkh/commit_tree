PCI: Add sysfs sriov_drivers_autoprobe to control VF driver binding

Sometimes it is not desirable to bind SR-IOV VFs to drivers.  This can save
host side resource usage by VF instances that will be assigned to VMs.

Add a new PCI sysfs interface "sriov_drivers_autoprobe" to control that
from the PF.  To modify it, echo 0/n/N (disable probe) or 1/y/Y (enable
probe) to:

  /sys/bus/pci/devices/<DOMAIN:BUS:DEVICE.FUNCTION>/sriov_drivers_autoprobe

Note that this must be done before enabling VFs.  The change will not take
effect if VFs are already enabled.  Simply, one can disable VFs by setting
sriov_numvfs to 0, choose whether to probe or not, and then re-enable the
VFs by restoring sriov_numvfs.
