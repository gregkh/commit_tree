dm mpath: avoid that path removal can trigger an infinite loop

If blk_get_request() fails, check whether the failure is due to a path
being removed.  If that is the case, fail the path by triggering a call
to fail_path().  This avoids that the following scenario can be
encountered while removing paths:
* CPU usage of a kworker thread jumps to 100%.
* Removing the DM device becomes impossible.

Delay requeueing if blk_get_request() returns -EBUSY or -EWOULDBLOCK,
and the queue is not dying, because in these cases immediate requeuing
is inappropriate.
