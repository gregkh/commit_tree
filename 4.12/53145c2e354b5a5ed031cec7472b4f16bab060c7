Revert "HID: magicmouse: Set multi-touch keybits for Magic Mouse"

Setting these bits causes libinput to fail to initialize the device;
setting BTN_TOUCH and BTN_TOOL_FINGER causes it to treat the mouse as a
touchpad, and it then refuses to continue when it discovers ABS_X is not
set.

This breaks all known Wayland compositors, as well as Xorg when the
libinput driver is being used.

This reverts commit f4b65b9563216b3e01a5cc844c3ba68901d9b195.
