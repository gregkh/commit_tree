ARM: sun5i: A10s: Switch the EMAC pins indices

One of the pins group for the EMAC can be used by all the SoCs of the sun5i
family, and as such can be moved to the common DTSI.

Unfortunately, this group is the second one we declare in our DT for now.
Make it the first one so that it's more logical and consistent with the
rest of our DTs before moving it.
