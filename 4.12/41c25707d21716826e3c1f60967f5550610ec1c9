cpuset: consider dying css as offline

In most cases, a cgroup controller don't care about the liftimes of
cgroups.  For the controller, a css becomes online when ->css_online()
is called on it and offline when ->css_offline() is called.

However, cpuset is special in that the user interface it exposes cares
whether certain cgroups exist or not.  Combined with the RCU delay
between cgroup removal and css offlining, this can lead to user
visible behavior oddities where operations which should succeed after
cgroup removals fail for some time period.  The effects of cgroup
removals are delayed when seen from userland.

This patch adds css_is_dying() which tests whether offline is pending
and updates is_cpuset_online() so that the function returns false also
while offline is pending.  This gets rid of the userland visible
delays.
