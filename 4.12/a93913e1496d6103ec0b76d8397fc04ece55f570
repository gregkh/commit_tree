HID: asus: fix and generalize ambiguous preprocessor macros

Before commits a1cbda7a65a7a ("HID: asus: drop dependency
on I2C_HID") and 64a403c6555fd ("HID: asus: support Republic
Of Gamers special keys") hid-asus only pertained to a single
I2C keyboard model found in ASUS X205TA, F205TA, & X200HA. The
aforementioned commits expanded this support to other ASUS
laptop keyboard models.

In order to clarify that existing keyboard and touchpad quirks
only apply to the I2C devices, and not ASUS keyboards in
general, I2C HID IDs and their corresponding quirk sets have
been renamed. In addition, the latter commit introduced
special key handling, which also applies to the I2C keyboard,
not just Republic of Gamers series. Therefore, the
rog_map_key_clear() macro is renamed to asus_map_key_clear()
for the sake of generality.
