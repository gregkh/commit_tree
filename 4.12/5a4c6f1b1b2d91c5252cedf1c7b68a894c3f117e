drm/i915: The return of i915_gpu_info to debugfs

Once upon a time before we had automated GPU state capture upon hangs,
we had intel_gpu_dump. Now we come almost full circle and reinstate that
view of the current GPU queues and registers by using the error capture
facility to snapshot the GPU state when debugfs/.../i915_gpu_info is
opened - which should provided useful debugging to both the error
capture routines (without having to cause a hang and avoid the error
state being eaten by igt) and generally.

v2: Rename drm_i915_error_state to i915_gpu_state to alleviate some name
collisions between the error state dump and inspecting the gpu state.
