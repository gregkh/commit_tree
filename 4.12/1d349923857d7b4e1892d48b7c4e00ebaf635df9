builddeb: Update a few outdated and hardcoded strings

The builddeb script has some hardcoded references to Linux version 2.6
which is ancient. Drop Provides as the virtual packages provided are not
useful anymore. Leave the Provides for linux-kernel-headers, as someone
might still be referring to it.

While at it, updated copyright date and drop Standards-Version: since
the package isn't Debian Standards compliant anyways.
