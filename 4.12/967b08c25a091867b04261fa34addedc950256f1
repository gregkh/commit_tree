RTC: rtc-cmos: Fix wakeup from suspend-to-idle

Commit eed4d47efe95 (ACPI / sleep: Ignore spurious SCI wakeups from
suspend-to-idle) modified the core suspend-to-idle code to filter
out spurious SCI interrupts received while suspended, which requires
ACPI event source handlers to report wakeup events in a way that
will trigger a wakeup from suspend to idle (or abort system suspends
in progress, which is equivalent).

That needs to be done in the rtc-cmos driver too, which was overlooked
by the above commit, so do that now.
