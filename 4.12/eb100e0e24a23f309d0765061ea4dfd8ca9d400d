net: bridge: allow to add externally learned entries from user-space

The NTF_EXT_LEARNED flag was added for switchdev and externally learned

in user-space which requires dynamic entries that do not expire.
One such case that we have is with quagga and evpn which need dynamic
entries but also require to age them themselves.
