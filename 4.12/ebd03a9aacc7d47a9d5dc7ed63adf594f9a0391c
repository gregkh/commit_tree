Revert "lib/test_sort.c: make it explicitly non-modular"

Patch series "lib: add module support to sort tests".

This patch series allows to compile the array-based and linked list sort
test code either to loadable modules, or builtin into the kernel.

It's very valuable to have modular tests, so you can run them just by
insmodding the test modules, instead of needing a separate kernel that
runs them at boot.
