qed: Support management-based resource locking

Global locking can't properly be used to synchronize between different
PFs in all scenarios, as those instances might reside in different
logical partitions [e.g., when a PF is assigned via PDA to some VM].

The management firmware provides a generic infrastructure for
device locks. For each 'resource', it's guaranteed it could be acquired
by at most a single PF at any given time [or by management firmware].

This patch adds the necessary logic in qed for utilizing said
infrastructure, implementing lock/unlock internal APIs.
