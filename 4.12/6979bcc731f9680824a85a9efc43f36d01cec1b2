samples/bpf: load_bpf.c make callback fixup more flexible

Do this change before others start to use this callback.
Change map_perf_test_user.c which seems to be the only user.

This patch extends capabilities of commit 9fd63d05f3e8 ("bpf:
Allow bpf sample programs (*_user.c) to change bpf_map_def").

Give fixup callback access to struct bpf_map_data, instead of
only stuct bpf_map_def.  This add flexibility to allow userspace
to reassign the map file descriptor.  This is very useful when
wanting to share maps between several bpf programs.
