ACPI / AC: Add a blacklist with PMIC ACPI HIDs with a native charger driver

On some systems we have a native PMIC driver which provides Mains
monitoring, while the ACPI ac driver is broken on these systems
due to bad DSTDs or because we do not support the proprietary and
undocumented ACPI opregions these ACPI battery devices rely on
(e.g. BMOP opregion).

This leads for example to a ADP1 power_supply which reports
itself as always online even if no mains are connected.

This commit adds a blacklist with PMIC ACPI HIDs for which we've a
native charger or extcon driver and makes the ACPI ac driver not
register itself when a PMIC on this list is present.
