drivers/perf: arm_pmu: remove pointless PMU disabling

We currently disable the PMU temporarily in armpmu_add(). We may have
required this historically, but the perf core always disables an event's
PMU when calling event::pmu::add(), so this is not necessary.

We don't do similarly in armpmu_del(), or elsewhere, so this is
unnecessary and inconsistent, and only serves to confuse the reader.

Remove the pointless disable, simplifying armpmu_add() in the process.
