net: bcmgenet: remove handling of wol interrupts from isr0

The bcmgenet_wol_isr() handler performs the necessary processing for
waking from a GENET event.  There is no necessary functionality behind
servicing the UMAC_IRQ_MPD_R event in the handling of isr0.  Therefore
the code that unmasks and masks this interrupt and that gets invoked
in response to it is removed by this commit.
