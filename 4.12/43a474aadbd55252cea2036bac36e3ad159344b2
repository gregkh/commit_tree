IB/rdmavt, IB/hfi1, IB/qib: Make wc opcode translation driver dependent

The work to create a completion helper moved the translation of send
wqe operations to completion opcodes to rdmvat.

This precludes having driver dependent operations.  Make the translation
driver dependent by doing the translation in the driver prior to the
rvt_qp_swqe_complete() call using restored translation tables.
