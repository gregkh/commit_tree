brd: fix uninitialized use of brd->dax_dev

commit 1647b9b9 "brd: add dax_operations support" introduced the allocation
and freeing of a dax_device, but the allocated dax_device is not stored
into the brd_device, so brd_del_one() will eventually operate on an
uninitialized brd->dax_dev.

Fix this by storing the allocated dax_device to brd->dax_dev.
