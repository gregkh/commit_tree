drm/i915/gen5+, pch: Enable hotplug detection early

To be consistent with the recent change to enable hotplug detection
early on GEN9 platforms do the same on all non-GMCH platforms starting
from GEN5. On GMCH platforms enabling detection without interrupts isn't
trivial, since AUX and HPD have a shared interrupt line. It could be
done there too by using a SW interrupt mask, but I punt on that for now.
