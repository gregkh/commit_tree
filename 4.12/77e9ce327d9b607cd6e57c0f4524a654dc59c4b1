ufs: fix the logics for tail relocation

* original hysteresis loop got broken by typo back in 2002; now
it never switches out of OPTTIME state.  Fixed.
* critical levels for switching from OPTTIME to OPTSPACE and back
ought to be calculated once, at mount time.
* we should use mul_u64_u32_div() for those calculations, now that
->s_dsize is 64bit.
* to quote Kirk McKusick (in 1995 FreeBSD commit message):
    The threshold for switching from time-space and space-time is too small
    when minfree is 5%...so make it stay at space in this case.
