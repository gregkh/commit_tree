xfs: remove xfs_bmap_remap_alloc

The main thing that xfs_bmap_remap_alloc does is fixing the AGFL, similar
to what we do in the space allocator.  But the reflink code doesn't touch
the allocation btree unlike the normal space allocator, so we couldn't
care less about the state of the AGFL.

So remove xfs_bmap_remap_alloc and just handle the di_nblocks update in
the caller.
