x86/xen: use capabilities instead of fake cpuid values for x2apic

When running as pv domain xen_cpuid() is being used instead of
native_cpuid(). In xen_cpuid() the x2apic feature is indicated as not
being present by special casing the related cpuid leaf.

Instead of delivering fake cpuid values clear the cpu capability bit
for x2apic instead.
