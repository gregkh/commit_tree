staging: ks7010: clean up SDIO source comments

SDIO code currently has a number of unneeded comments. Following
kernel coding style we do not need extraneous comments, especially on
code where it is clear what is being done. Spelling typos can be
fixed.

Remove unnecessary comments, fix typos in comments.
