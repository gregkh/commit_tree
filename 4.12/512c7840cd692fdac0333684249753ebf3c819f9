qed: Don't log missing periodic stats by default

Current implementation lacks the logic for providing management
firmware with RDMA-related statistics; [much] worse than that -
it logs such events by default to system logs.

Since the statistics' gathering is done periodically, using sufficiently
new management firmware the system logs would get filled with these
unnecessary prints.

For now, reduce the verbosity of the log so that it would not be
logged by default.
