scsi: be2iscsi: Fix closing of connection

CID needs to be freed even when invalidate or upload connection fails.
Attempt to close connection 3 times before freeing CID.

Set cleanup_type to INVALIDATE instead of force TCP_RST.  This
unnecessarily is terminating connection with reset instead of gracefully
closing it.

Set save_cfg to 0 - session not to be saved on flash.

Add delay and process CQ before uploading connection.
