lightnvm: potential underflow in pblk_read_rq()

This is a static checker fix, and perhaps not a real bug.  The static
checker thinks that nr_secs could be negative.  It would result in
zeroing more memory than intended.  Anyway, even if it's not a bug,
changing this variable to unsigned makes the code easier to audit.
