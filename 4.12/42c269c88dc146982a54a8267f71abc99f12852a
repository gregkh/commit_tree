ftrace: Allow for function tracing to record init functions on boot up

Adding a hook into free_reserve_area() that informs ftrace that boot up init
text is being free, lets ftrace safely remove those init functions from its
records, which keeps ftrace from trying to modify text that no longer
exists.

Note, this still does not allow for tracing .init text of modules, as
modules require different work for freeing its init code.
