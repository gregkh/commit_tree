arm: sun8i: h3: split Allwinner H3 .dtsi

The new Allwinner H5 SoC is pin-compatible to the H3 SoC, but with the
Cortex-A7 cores replaced by Cortex-A53 cores and the MMC controller
updated. So we should really share almost the whole .dtsi.
In preparation for that move the peripheral parts of the existing
sun8i-h3.dtsi into a new sunxi-h3-h5.dtsi.
The actual sun8i-h3.dtsi then includes that and defines the H3 specific
parts on top of it.
