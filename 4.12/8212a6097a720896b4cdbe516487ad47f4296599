fsnotify: Remove indirection from fsnotify_detach_mark()

fsnotify_detach_mark() calls fsnotify_destroy_inode_mark() or
fsnotify_destroy_vfsmount_mark() to remove mark from object list. These
two functions are however very similar and differ only in the lock they
use to protect the object list of marks. Simplify the code by removing
the indirection and removing mark from the object list in a common
function.
