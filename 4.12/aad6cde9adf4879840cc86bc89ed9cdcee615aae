quota: Stop setting IMMUTABLE and NOATIME flags on quota files

Currently we set IMMUTABLE and NOATIME flags on quota files to stop
userspace from messing with them. Now that all filesystems set these
flags in their quota_on handlers, we can stop setting the flags in
generic quota code. This will allow filesystems to stop copying i_flags
to their on-disk flags on various occasions.
