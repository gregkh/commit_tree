lockd: fix lockd shutdown race

As reported by David Jeffery: "a signal was sent to lockd while lockd
was shutting down from a request to stop nfs.  The signal causes lockd
to call restart_grace() which puts the lockd_net structure on the grace
list.  If this signal is received at the wrong time, it will occur after
lockd_down_net() has called locks_end_grace() but before
lockd_down_net() stops the lockd thread.  This leads to lockd putting
the lockd_net structure back on the grace list, then exiting without
anything removing it from the list."

So, perform the final locks_end_grace() from the the lockd thread; this
ensures it's serialized with respect to restart_grace().
