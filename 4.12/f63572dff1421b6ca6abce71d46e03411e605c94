nvme: unmap CMB and remove sysfs file in reset path

CMB doesn't get unmapped until removal while getting remapped on every
reset. Add the unmapping and sysfs file removal to the reset path in
nvme_pci_disable to match the mapping path in nvme_pci_enable.

Fixes: 202021c1a ("nvme : Add sysfs entry for NVMe CMBs when appropriate")
