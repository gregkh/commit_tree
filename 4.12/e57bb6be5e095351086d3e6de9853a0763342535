RDMA/qedr: Add 64KB PAGE_SIZE support to user-space queues

Add 64KB PAGE_SIZE support to user-space CQ, SQ and RQ queues.
De-facto it means that code was added to translate 64KB
pages to smaller 4KB pages that the FW can handle. Otherwise,
the FW would wrap (or jump to the next page)  when reaching 4KB
while the user space library will continue on the same large page.

Note that MR code remains as is since the FW supports larger pages
for MRs.
