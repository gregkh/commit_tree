cpufreq: intel_pstate: Clean up intel_pstate_busy_pid_reset()

intel_pstate_busy_pid_reset() is the only caller of pid_reset(),
pid_p_gain_set(), pid_i_gain_set(), and pid_d_gain_set().  Moreover,
it passes constants as two parameters of pid_reset() and all of
the other routines above essentially contain the same code, so
fold all of them into the caller and drop unnecessary computations.

Introduce percent_fp() for converting integer values in percent
to fixed-point fractions and use it in the above code cleanup.

Finally, rename intel_pstate_busy_pid_reset() to
intel_pstate_pid_reset() as it also is used for the
initialization of PID parameters for every CPU and the
meaning of the "busy" part of the name is not particularly
clear.
