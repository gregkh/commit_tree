powerpc/kprobes: Prefer ftrace when probing function entry

KPROBES_ON_FTRACE avoids much of the overhead of regular kprobes as it
eliminates the need for a trap, as well as the need to emulate or single-step
instructions.

Though OPTPROBES provides us with similar performance, we have limited
optprobes trampoline slots. As such, when asked to probe at a function
entry, default to using the ftrace infrastructure.

With:
  # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
  # echo 'p _do_fork' > kprobe_events

before patch:
  # cat ../kprobes/list
  c0000000000daf08  k  _do_fork+0x8    [DISABLED]
  c000000000044fc0  k  kretprobe_trampoline+0x0    [OPTIMIZED]

and after patch:
  # cat ../kprobes/list
  c0000000000d074c  k  _do_fork+0xc    [DISABLED][FTRACE]
  c0000000000412b0  k  kretprobe_trampoline+0x0    [OPTIMIZED]
