powerpc/64: Initialise thread_info for emergency stacks

Emergency stacks have their thread_info mostly uninitialised, which in
particular means garbage preempt_count values.

Emergency stack code runs with interrupts disabled entirely, and is
used very rarely, so this has been unnoticed so far. It was found by a
proposed new powerpc watchdog that takes a soft-NMI directly from the
masked_interrupt handler and using the emergency stack. That crashed
at BUG_ON(in_nmi()) in nmi_enter(). preempt_count()s were found to be
garbage.

To fix this, zero the entire THREAD_SIZE allocation, and initialize
the thread_info.
