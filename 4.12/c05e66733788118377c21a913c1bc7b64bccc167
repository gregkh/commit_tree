sbitmap: add sbitmap_get_shallow() operation

This operation supports the use case of limiting the number of bits that
can be allocated for a given operation. Rather than setting aside some
bits at the end of the bitmap, we can set aside bits in each word of the
bitmap. This means we can keep the allocation hints spread out and
support sbitmap_resize() nicely at the cost of lower granularity for the
allowed depth.
