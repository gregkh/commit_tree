watchdog: iTCO_wdt: cleanup set/unset no_reboot_bit functions

iTCO_wdt no_reboot_bit set/unset functions has lot of common code between
them. So merging these two functions into a single update function would
remove these unnecessary code duplications. This patch fixes this issue
by creating a no_reboot_bit update function to handle both set/unset
functions.

Also checking for iTCO version every time you make no_reboot_bit set/unset
call is inefficient and makes the code look complex. This can be improved
by performing this check once during device probe and selecting the
appropriate no_reboot_bit update function. This patch fixes this issue
by splitting the update function into multiple helper functions.
