ALSA: timer: Fix race between read and ioctl

The read from ALSA timer device, the function snd_timer_user_tread(),
may access to an uninitialized struct snd_timer_user fields when the
read is concurrently performed while the ioctl like
snd_timer_user_tselect() is invoked.  We have already fixed the races
among ioctls via a mutex, but we seem to have forgotten the race
between read vs ioctl.

This patch simply applies (more exactly extends the already applied
range of) tu->ioctl_lock in snd_timer_user_tread() for closing the
race window.
