dm ioctl: prevent stack leak in dm ioctl call

When calling a dm ioctl that doesn't process any data
(IOCTL_FLAGS_NO_PARAMS), the contents of the data field in struct
dm_ioctl are left initialized.  Current code is incorrectly extending
the size of data copied back to user, causing the contents of kernel
stack to be leaked to user.  Fix by only copying contents before data
and allow the functions processing the ioctl to override.
