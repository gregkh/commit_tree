PCI: Don't reassign resources that are already aligned

The "pci=resource_alignment=" kernel argument designates devices for which
we want alignment greater than is required by the PCI specs.  Previously we
set IORESOURCE_UNSET for every MEM resource of those devices, even if the
resource was *already* sufficiently aligned.

If a resource is already sufficiently aligned, leave it alone and don't try
to reassign it.
