perf vendor events intel: Add missing UNC_M_DCLOCKTICKS for Broadwell DE uncore

An earlier update removed the UNC_M_CLOCKTICKS event for Broadwell DE.
But Metric events were still referring to it.
This adds it back under a different name from the event list,
and also fixes up the Metric events to use the new name.
