bpf: remove struct bpf_map_type_list

There's no need to have struct bpf_map_type_list since
it just contains a list_head, the type, and the ops
pointer. Since the types are densely packed and not
actually dynamically registered, it's much easier and
smaller to have an array of type->ops pointer. Also
initialize this array statically to remove code needed
to initialize it.

In order to save duplicating the list, move it to the
types header file added by the previous patch and
include it in the same fashion.
