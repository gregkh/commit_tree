udp: use sk_protocol instead of pcflag to detect udplite sockets

In the udp_sock struct, the 'forward_deficit' and 'pcflag' fields
share the same cacheline. While the first is dirtied by
udp_recvmsg, the latter is read, possibly several times, by the
bottom half processing to discriminate between udp and udplite
sockets.

With this patch, sk->sk_protocol is used to check is the socket is
really an udplite one, avoiding some cache misses per
packet and improving the performance under udp_flood with
small packet up to 10%.
