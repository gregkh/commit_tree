mm: numa: avoid waiting on freed migrated pages

In do_huge_pmd_numa_page(), we attempt to handle a migrating thp pmd by
waiting until the pmd is unlocked before we return and retry.  However,
we can race with migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page():

    // do_huge_pmd_numa_page                // migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page()
    // Holds 0 refs on page                 // Holds 2 refs on page

    vmf->ptl = pmd_lock(vma->vm_mm, vmf->pmd);
    /* ... */
    if (pmd_trans_migrating(*vmf->pmd)) {
            page = pmd_page(*vmf->pmd);
            spin_unlock(vmf->ptl);
                                            ptl = pmd_lock(mm, pmd);
                                            if (page_count(page) != 2)) {
                                                    /* roll back */
                                            }
                                            /* ... */
                                            mlock_migrate_page(new_page, page);
                                            /* ... */
                                            spin_unlock(ptl);
                                            put_page(page);
                                            put_page(page); // page freed here
            wait_on_page_locked(page);
            goto out;
    }

This can result in the freed page having its waiters flag set
unexpectedly, which trips the PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_PREP checks in the
page alloc/free functions.  This has been observed on arm64 KVM guests.

We can avoid this by having do_huge_pmd_numa_page() take a reference on
the page before dropping the pmd lock, mirroring what we do in
__migration_entry_wait().

When we hit the race, migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page() will see the
reference and abort the migration, as it may do today in other cases.
