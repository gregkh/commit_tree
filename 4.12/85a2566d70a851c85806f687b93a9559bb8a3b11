nfc: Send same info for both of NFC_CMD_GET_DEVICE and NFC_EVENT_DEVICE_ADDED

Now, NFC_EVENT_DEVICE_ADDED doesn't send NFC_ATTR_RF_MODE. But
NFC_CMD_GET_DEVICE send.

To get NFC_ATTR_RF_MODE, we have to call NFC_CMD_GET_DEVICE just for
NFC_ATTR_RF_MODE when get NFC_EVENT_DEVICE_ADDED.

This fixes those inconsistent.
