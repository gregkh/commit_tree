ath10k: update available channel list for 5G radio

If a 5 GHz radio is calibrated for operation in both
the low band (channels 36 to 64) and high band(channels 100 to 169),
hardware allows operations in all the listed channels. However,
if the chip has been calibrated only for the low/high band and
a high/low band channel is configured, due to lack of calibration
there will be potentially invalid signal on those non calibrated channels.
To avoid this problem this patch sets IEEE80211_CHAN_DISABLED flag for
those non calibrated channels by using low_5ghz_chan and high_5ghz_chan
values which we get from target through wmi service ready event.

Driver initialized flags are getting re initialized in handle_channel
in cfg80211. So calling the function to disable the non supported channel
from reg_notifier().
