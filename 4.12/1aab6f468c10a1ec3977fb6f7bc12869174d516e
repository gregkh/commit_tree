KVM: arm/arm64: Register iodevs when setting redist base and creating VCPUs

Instead of waiting with registering KVM iodevs until the first VCPU is
run, we can actually create the iodevs when the redist base address is
set.  The only downside is that we must now also check if we need to do
this for VCPUs which are created after creating the VGIC, because there
is no enforced ordering between creating the VGIC (and setting its base
addresses) and creating the VCPUs.
