gpio: acpi: Don't return 0 on acpi_gpio_count()

It's unusual to have error checking like (ret <= 0) in cases when
counting GPIO resources. In case when it's mandatory we propagate the
error (-ENOENT), otherwise we don't use the result.

This makes consistent behaviour across all possible variants called in
gpiod_count().
