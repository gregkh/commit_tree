btrfs: qgroup: Re-arrange tracepoint timing to co-operate with reserved space tracepoint

Newly introduced qgroup reserved space trace points are normally nested
into several common qgroup operations.

While some other trace points are not well placed to co-operate with
them, causing confusing output.

This patch re-arrange trace_btrfs_qgroup_release_data() and
trace_btrfs_qgroup_free_delayed_ref() trace points so they are triggered
before reserved space ones.
