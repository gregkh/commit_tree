axon_ram: add dax_operations support

Setup a dax_device to have the same lifetime as the axon_ram block
device and add a ->direct_access() method that is equivalent to
axon_ram_direct_access(). Once fs/dax.c has been converted to use
dax_operations the old axon_ram_direct_access() will be removed.
