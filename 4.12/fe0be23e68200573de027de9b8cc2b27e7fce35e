xfs: reserve enough blocks to handle btree splits when remapping

In xfs_reflink_end_cow, we erroneously reserve only enough blocks to
handle adding 1 extent.  This is problematic if we fragment free space,
have to do CoW, and then have to perform multiple bmap btree expansions.
Furthermore, the BUI recovery routine doesn't reserve /any/ blocks to
handle btree splits, so log recovery fails after our first error causes
the filesystem to go down.

Therefore, refactor the transaction block reservation macros until we
have a macro that works for our deferred (re)mapping activities, and fix
both problems by using that macro.

With 1k blocks we can hit this fairly often in g/187 if the scratch fs
is big enough.
