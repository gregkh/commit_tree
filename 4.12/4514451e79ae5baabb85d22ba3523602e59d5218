bdi: Do not wait for cgwbs release in bdi_unregister()

Currently we wait for all cgwbs to get released in cgwb_bdi_destroy()
(called from bdi_unregister()). That is however unnecessary now when
cgwb->bdi is a proper refcounted reference (thus bdi cannot get
released before all cgwbs are released) and when cgwb_bdi_destroy()
shuts down writeback directly.
