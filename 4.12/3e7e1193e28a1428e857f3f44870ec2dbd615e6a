IB: Replace ib_umem page_size by page_shift

Size of pages are held by struct ib_umem in page_size field.

It is better to store it as an exponent, because page size by nature
is always power-of-two and used as a factor, divisor or ilog2's argument.

The conversion of page_size to be page_shift allows to have portable
code and avoid following error while compiling on ARM:

  ERROR: "__aeabi_uldivmod" [drivers/infiniband/core/ib_core.ko] undefined!
