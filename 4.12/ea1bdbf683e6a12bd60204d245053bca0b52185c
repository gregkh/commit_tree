KVM: MIPS: Update exit handler for VZ

The general guest exit handler needs a few tweaks for VZ compared to
trap & emulate, which for now are made directly depending on
CONFIG_KVM_MIPS_VZ:

- There is no need to re-enable the hardware page table walker (HTW), as
  it can be left enabled during guest mode operation with VZ.

- There is no need to perform a privilege check, as any guest privilege
  violations should have already been detected by the hardware and
  triggered the appropriate guest exception.
