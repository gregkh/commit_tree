[media] em28xx: simplify ID-reading from Micron sensors

Use i2c_smbus_read_word_data() instead of i2c_master_send() and
i2c_master_recv() for reading the ID of Micorn sensors.

i2c_smbus_read_word_data() assumes that byes are in little-endian,
so, it uses:
	data->word = msgbuf1[0] | (msgbuf1[1] << 8);

However, Micron datasheet describes the ID as if they were read
in big-endian. So, we need to change the byte order in order to
match the ID number as described on their datasheets.
