ipv6: initialize route null entry in addrconf_init()

Andrey reported a crash on init_net.ipv6.ip6_null_entry->rt6i_idev
since it is always NULL.

This is clearly wrong, we have code to initialize it to loopback_dev,
unfortunately the order is still not correct.

loopback_dev is registered very early during boot, we lose a chance
to re-initialize it in notifier. addrconf_init() is called after
ip6_route_init(), which means we have no chance to correct it.

Fix it by moving this initialization explicitly after
ipv6_add_dev(init_net.loopback_dev) in addrconf_init().
