arm: spear6xx: remove unneeded pinctrl properties in spear600-evb

The spear6xx doesn't have a pinctrl driver, since the pinmux is globally
defined through a single register, generally configured by the
firmware/bootloader.

Therefore, the pinctrl related properties in spear600-evb.dts are not
necessary.
