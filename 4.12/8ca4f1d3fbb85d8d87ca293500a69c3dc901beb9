ACPI/IORT: Introduce iort_node_map_platform_id() to retrieve dev id

To retrieve dev id for IORT named components nodes there are
two steps involved (second is optional):

(1) Retrieve the initial id (this may well provide the final mapping)
(2) Map the id (optional if (1) represents the map type we need), this
    is needed for use cases such as NC (named component) -> SMMU -> ITS
    mappings.

the iort_node_get_id() function was created for step (1) above and
iort_node_map_rid() for step (2).

Create a wrapper, named iort_node_map_platform_id(), that encompasses
the two steps at once to retrieve the dev id to provide steps (1)-(2)
functionality.

iort_node_map_platform_id() will handle the parent type so type handling
in iort_node_get_id() is duplicated, remove it and update current
iort_node_get_id() users to move them over to iort_node_map_platform_id().
