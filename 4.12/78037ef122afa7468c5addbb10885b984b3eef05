staging: ks7010: rename identifier packet to skb

Kernel networking code predominately uses the identifier 'skb' for a struct
sk_buff pointer. Of 8088 instances of 'struct sk_buff *' within
net/ 6670 are named 'skb'. Following the principle of least surprise,
new networking code should use the identifier 'skb' for variables of
type 'struct sk_buff *'.

Rename identifier 'packet' to 'skb'.
