i40e: Allow untrusted VFs to have more filters

Our original filter limit of 8 was based on behavior that we saw from
Linux VMs. Now we're running Other Operating Systems under KVM and we
see that they commonly use more MAC filters. Since it seems weird to
require people to enable trusted VFs just to boot their OS, bump the
number of filters allowed by default.
