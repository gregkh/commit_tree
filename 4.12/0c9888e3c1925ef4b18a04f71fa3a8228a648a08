power: supply: cpcap-charger: Add minimal CPCAP PMIC battery charger

The custom CPCAP PMIC used on Motorola phones such as Droid 4 has a
USB battery charger. It can optionally also have a companion chip that
is used for wireless charging.

The charger on CPCAP also can feed VBUS for the USB host mode. This
can be handled by the existing kernel phy_companion interface.
