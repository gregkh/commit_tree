sfc: Fix MCDI command size for filter operations

The 8000 series adapters uses catch-all filters for encapsulated traffic
to support filtering VXLAN, NVGRE and GENEVE traffic.
This new filter functionality requires a longer MCDI command.
This patch increases the size of buffers on stack that were missed, which
fixes a kernel panic from the stack protector.
