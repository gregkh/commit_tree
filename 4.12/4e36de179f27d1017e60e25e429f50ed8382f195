arm64: allwinner: h5: add Allwinner H5 .dtsi

The Allwinner H5 SoC is pin-compatible to the H3 SoC, but uses
Cortex-A53 cores instead.
Based on the now shared base .dtsi describing the common peripherals
describe the H5 specific nodes on top of that.
That symlinks in the sunxi-h3-h5.dtsi from the arch/arm tree.

[Icenowy: add H5 pinctrl compatible, and changes for my h3-h5 dtsi
 refactor, commit message changed to meet new arm64 naming scheme,
 drop H3 pinctrl compatible because of interrupt bank change, drop
 H3 ccu compatible because of clock change, drop ccu node as it come
 into h3-h5 dtsi]
