mm/sparse: refine usemap_size() a little

The current implementation calculates usemap_size in two steps:
    * calculate number of bytes to cover these bits
    * calculate number of "unsigned long" to cover these bytes

It would be more clear by:
    * calculate number of "unsigned long" to cover these bits
    * multiple it with sizeof(unsigned long)

This patch refine usemap_size() a little to make it more easy to
understand.
