clocksource/drivers/fttmr010: Refactor to handle clock

The plain Faraday FTTMR010 timer needs a clock to figure out its
tick rate, and the gemini reads it directly from the system
controller set-up. Split the init function and add two paths for
the two compatible-strings. We only support clocking using PCLK
because of lack of documentation on how EXTCLK works.

The Gemini still works like before, but we can also support a
generic, clock-based version.
