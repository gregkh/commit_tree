iscsi-target: Fix delayed logout processing greater than SECONDS_FOR_LOGOUT_COMP

This patch fixes a BUG() in iscsit_close_session() that could be
triggered when iscsit_logout_post_handler() execution from within
tx thread context was not run for more than SECONDS_FOR_LOGOUT_COMP
(15 seconds), and the TCP connection didn't already close before
then forcing tx thread context to automatically exit.

This would manifest itself during explicit logout as:

[33206.974254] 1 connection(s) still exist for iSCSI session to iqn.1993-08.org.debian:01:3f5523242179
[33206.980184] INFO: NMI handler (kgdb_nmi_handler) took too long to run: 2100.772 msecs
[33209.078643] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[33209.078646] kernel BUG at drivers/target/iscsi/iscsi_target.c:4346!

Normally when explicit logout attempt fails, the tx thread context
exits and iscsit_close_connection() from rx thread context does the
extra cleanup once it detects conn->conn_logout_remove has not been
cleared by the logout type specific post handlers.

To address this special case, if the logout post handler in tx thread
context detects conn->tx_thread_active has already been cleared, simply
return and exit in order for existing iscsit_close_connection()
logic from rx thread context do failed logout cleanup.
