audit: Use timespec64 to represent audit timestamps

struct timespec is not y2038 safe.
Audit timestamps are recorded in string format into
an audit buffer for a given context.
These mark the entry timestamps for the syscalls.
Use y2038 safe struct timespec64 to represent the times.
The log strings can handle this transition as strings can
hold upto 1024 characters.
