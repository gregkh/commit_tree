auxdisplay: ht16k33: don't access uninitialized data

gcc-7.0.1 points out that we copy uninitialized data from the stack
into a per-device structure:

drivers/auxdisplay/ht16k33.c: In function 'ht16k33_keypad_irq_thread':
arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:78:16: error: 'new_state' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:79:22: error: '*((void *)&new_state+4)' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The access is harmless because we never read the data, but we are better
off not doing this, so this changes the code to only copy the data
that was actually initialized. To make sure we don't overflow the
stack with an incorrect DT, we also need to add a sanity checkin the
probe function.
