platform/x86: dell-laptop: Protect kbd_state against races

The kbd led code has multiple entry points each of which modifies the
kbd_state by reading it, modifying a copy, writing the copy and on
error setting the modified copy writing back the original state.

This is racy, so add a mutex protection the read-modify-write cycle
on each of the entry points.
