device property: Add support for fwnode endpoints

Similar to OF endpoints, endpoint type nodes can be also supported on
ACPI. In order to make it possible for drivers to ignore the matter,
add a type for fwnode_endpoint and a function to parse them.

On ACPI, find the child node index instead of relying on the "endpoint"
property.
