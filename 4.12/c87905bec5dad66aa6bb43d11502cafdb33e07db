mac80211: set bss_info data before configuring the channel

When mac80211 changes the channel, it also calls into the driver's
bss_info_changed() callback, e.g. with BSS_CHANGED_IDLE. The driver
may, like iwlwifi does, access more data from bss_info in that case
and iwlwifi accesses the basic_rates bitmap, but if changing from a
band with more (basic) rates to one with fewer, an out-of-bounds
access of the rate array may result.

While we can't avoid having invalid data at some point in time, we
can avoid having it while we call the driver - so set up all the
data before configuring the channel, and then apply it afterwards.
