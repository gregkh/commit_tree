mm/swapfile.c: fix swap space leak in error path of swap_free_entries()

In swapcache_free_entries(), if swap_info_get_cont() returns NULL,
something wrong occurs for the swap entry.  But we should still continue
to free the following swap entries in the array instead of skip them to
avoid swap space leak.  This is just problem in error path, where system
may be in an inconsistent state, but it is still good to fix it.
