ALSA: firewire-motu: add tracepoints for messages for unique protocol

MOTU units transfer/receive messages in each data block of their
isochronous packet payload. A part of content in the message is cleard for
MIDI message transmission, while the rest is unknown yet. Additional
features are required to assist users and developers to reveal the
details.

This commit adds tracepoints for the purpose. The tracepoints are designed
for MOTU's protocol version 2 and 3 (Protocol version 1 is not upstreamed
yet). In the tracepoints, events are probed to gather first two 24 bit
data chunks of each data block. The chunks are formatted into elements
of 64 bit array with padding in MSB.
