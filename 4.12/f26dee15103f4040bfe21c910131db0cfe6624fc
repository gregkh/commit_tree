debug: Avoid setting BUGFLAG_WARNING twice

Dan reported that his static checking complains about BUGFLAG_WARNING
being set on both sides of the bitwise-or, it figures that that might've
been an unintentional mistake.

Since there are no architectures that implement __WARN_TAINT() (I
converted them all to implement __WARN_FLAGS()), and all __WARN_FLAGS()
implementations already set BUGFLAG_WARNING, we can remove the bit from
BUGFLAG_TAINT() and make Dan's checker happy.
