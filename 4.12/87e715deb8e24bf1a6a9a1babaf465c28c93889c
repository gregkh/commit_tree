zorro: stop creating attributes by hand

Instead of creating attributes one by one, define attribute_group array
and attach it to bus->dev_groups, so that all needed attributes are created
automatically when a new device is registered on the bus.

Also switch to using standard DEVICE_ATTR_RO() macros.
