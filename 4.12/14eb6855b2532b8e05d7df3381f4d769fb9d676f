ARM: dts: am335x-icev2: Add SPI based NOR

Enable support for W25Q64CVSSIG which is a Winbond 64 Mbit SPI NOR.

At boot you will see the following message:
m25p80 spi1.0: found s25fl064k, expected w25q64

This is because the JEDEC ID for this chip is the same as s25fl064k.
However, this should be harmless since both chips are essentially the
same.
