ASoC: qcom: move clock names into LPASS variant struct

The clock names for the two supported codecs are either
"mi2s-*" name variants generated by code. This naming scheme
does not work for platforms like MSM8660 which has I2S channels
named CODEC_I2S_SPKR (rather than just "MI2S tertiary" and other
repetitive names) and consequently have clocks named
"codec-i2s-spkr-osr-clk" and similar.

Skip the runtime generation of clock names and replace it with
name lookup tables encoded into the variant data.
