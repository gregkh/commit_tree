KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Do not fail emulation with mtspr/mfspr for unknown SPRs

According to the PowerISA 2.07, mtspr and mfspr should not always
generate an illegal instruction exception when being used with an
undefined SPR, but rather treat the instruction as a NOP or inject a
privilege exception in some cases, too - depending on the SPR number.
Also turn the printk here into a ratelimited print statement, so that
the guest can not flood the dmesg log of the host by issueing lots of
illegal mtspr/mfspr instruction here.
