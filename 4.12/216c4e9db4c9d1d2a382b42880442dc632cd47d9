PowerCap: Fix an error code in powercap_register_zone()

In the current code we accidentally return the successful result from
idr_alloc() instead of a negative error pointer.  The caller is looking
for an error pointer and so it treats the returned value as a valid
pointer.

This one might be a bit serious because if it lets people get around the
kernel's protection for remapping NULL.  I'm not sure.
