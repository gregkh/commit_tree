mtd: nand: denali: remove meaningless pipeline read-ahead operation

The pipeline read-ahead function of the Denali IP enables continuous
reading from the device; while data is being read out by a CPU, the
controller maintains additional commands for streaming data from the
device.  This will reduce the latency of the second page or later.

This feature is obviously no help for per-page accessors of Linux
NAND driver interface.

In the current implementation, the pipeline command is issued to
load a single page, then data are read out immediately.  The use of
the pipeline operation is not adding any advantage, but just adding
complexity to the code.  Remove.
