net: bridge: Fix improper taking over HW learned FDB

Commit 7e26bf45e4cb ("net: bridge: allow SW learn to take over HW fdb
entries") added the ability to "take over an entry which was previously
learned via HW when it shows up from a SW port".

However, if an entry was learned via HW and then a control packet
(e.g., ARP request) was trapped to the CPU, the bridge driver will
update the entry and remove the externally learned flag, although the
entry is still present in HW. Instead, only clear the externally learned
flag in case of roaming.
