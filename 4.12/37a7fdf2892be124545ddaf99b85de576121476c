tg3: don't clear stats while tg3_close

Now tg3 NIC's stats will be cleared after ifdown/ifup. bond_get_stats traverse
its salves to get statistics,cumulative the increment.If a tg3 NIC is added to
bonding as a slave,ifdown/ifup will cause bonding's stats become tremendous value
(ex.1638.3 PiB) because of negative increment.
