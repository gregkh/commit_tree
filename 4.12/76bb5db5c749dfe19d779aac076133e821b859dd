netvsc: fix use after free on module removal

The NAPI data structure is embedded in the netvsc_device structure
and is freed when device is closed. There is still a reference
(in NAPI list) to this which causes a crash in netif_napi_del
when device is removed. Fix by managing NAPI instances correctly.
