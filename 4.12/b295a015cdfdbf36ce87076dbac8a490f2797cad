clk: cs2000: tidyup DEVICE_CFG2 settings

DEVICE_CFG2 can select ratio from user defined ratio and LOCKCLK is
for it. But current driver sets fixed 0 value. This patch fixes it.
Note is that current cs2000 driver is using/supporting only ratio0
(= ch0) now.

DEVICE_CFG2 can select STATIC/DYNAMIC ratio mode, and current cs2000
driver is selecting STATIC mode, but it was not understandable on
current code. This patch also solve this issue.
