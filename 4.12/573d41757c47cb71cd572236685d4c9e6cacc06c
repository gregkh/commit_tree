iommu/of: Fix check for returning EPROBE_DEFER

Now with IOMMU probe deferral, we return -EPROBE_DEFER
for masters that are connected to an IOMMU which is not
probed yet, but going to get probed, so that we can attach
the correct dma_ops. So while trying to defer the probe of
the master, check if the of_iommu node that it is connected
to is marked in DT as 'status=disabled', then the IOMMU is never
is going to get probed. So simply return NULL and let the master
work without an IOMMU.

Fixes: 7b07cbefb68d ("iommu: of: Handle IOMMU lookup failure with deferred probing or error")
