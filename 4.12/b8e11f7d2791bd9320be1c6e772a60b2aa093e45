cpufreq: conservative: Allow down_threshold to take values from 1 to 10

Commit 27ed3cd2ebf4 (cpufreq: conservative: Fix the logic in frequency
decrease checking) removed the 10 point substraction when comparing the
load against down_threshold but did not remove the related limit for the
down_threshold value.  As a result, down_threshold lower than 11 is not
allowed even though values from 1 to 10 do work correctly too. The
comment ("cannot be lower than 11 otherwise freq will not fall") also
does not apply after removing the substraction.

For this reason, allow down_threshold to take any value from 1 to 99
and fix the related comment.
