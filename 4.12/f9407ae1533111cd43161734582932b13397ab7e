drm/i915: Use i9xx_check_plane_surface() for sprite planes as well

All the pre-SKL sprite planes compute the x/y/tile offsets in a
similar way. There are a couple of minor differences but the primary
planes have those as well. Thus i9xx_check_plane_surface()
already does what we need, so let's use it.
