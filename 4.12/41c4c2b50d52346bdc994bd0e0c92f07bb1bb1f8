i40e: allow look-up of MAC address from Open Firmware or IDPROM

Look up the MAC address from the eth_get_platform_mac_address() function
first before checking what the firmware provides. We already handle the
case of re-writing the MAC-VLAN filter, so there is no need to add extra
code for this. However, update the comment where we do this to indicate
that it does impact the Open Firmware MAC address case.
