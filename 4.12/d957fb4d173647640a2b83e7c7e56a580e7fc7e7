powerpc: Fix booting P9 hash with CONFIG_PPC_RADIX_MMU=N

Currently if you disable CONFIG_PPC_RADIX_MMU you'll crash on boot on
a P9. This is because we still set MMU_FTR_TYPE_RADIX via
ibm,pa-features and MMU_FTR_TYPE_RADIX is what's used for code patching
in much of the asm code (ie. slb_miss_realmode)

This patch fixes the problem by stopping MMU_FTR_TYPE_RADIX from being
set from ibm.pa-features.

We may eventually end up removing the CONFIG_PPC_RADIX_MMU option
completely but until then this fixes the issue.
