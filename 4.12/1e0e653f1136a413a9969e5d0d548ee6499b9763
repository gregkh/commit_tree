reiserfs: Protect dquot_writeback_dquots() by s_umount semaphore

dquot_writeback_dquots() expects s_umount semaphore to be held to
protect it from other concurrent quota operations. reiserfs_sync_fs()
can call dquot_writeback_dquots() without holding s_umount semaphore
when called from flush_old_commits().

Fix the problem by grabbing s_umount in flush_old_commits(). However we
have to be careful and use only trylock since reiserfs_cancel_old_sync()
can be waiting for flush_old_commits() to complete while holding
s_umount semaphore. Possible postponing of sync work is not a big deal
though as that is only an opportunistic flush.
