net: stmmac: dwc-qos: Split out ->probe() and ->remove()

Split out the binding specific parts of ->probe() and ->remove() to
enable the driver to support variants of the binding. This is useful in
order to keep backwards-compatibility while making it easy for a sub-
driver to deal only with the updated bindings rather than having to add
compatibility quirks all over the place.
