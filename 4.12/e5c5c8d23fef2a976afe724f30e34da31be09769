soc/fsl/qe: only apply QE_General4 workaround on affected SoCs

The QE_General4 workaround is only valid for the MPC832x and MPC836x
SoCs. The other SoCs that embed a QUICC engine are not affected by this
hardware bug and thus can use the computed divisors (this was
successfully tested on the T1040).

Similalry to what was done in commit 8ce795cb0c6b ("i2c: mpc: assign the
correct prescaler from SVR") in order to avoid changes in
the device tree nodes of the QE (with maybe a variant of the compatible
property), the PVR reg is read out to find out if the workaround must be
applied or not.
