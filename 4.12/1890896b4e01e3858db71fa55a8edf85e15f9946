xprtrdma: Refactor rpcrdma_ep_connect

I'm about to add another arm to

    if (ep->rep_connected != 0)

It will be cleaner to use a switch statement here. We'll be looking
for a couple of specific errnos, or "anything else," basically to
sort out the difference between a normal reconnect and recovery from
device removal.

This is a refactoring change only.
