dt-bindings: mdio: Clarify binding document

The described GPIO reset property is applicable to *all* child PHYs. If
we have one reset line per PHY present on the MDIO bus, these
automatically become properties of the child PHY nodes.

Finally, indicate how the RESET pulse width must be defined, which is
the maximum value of all individual PHYs RESET pulse widths determined
by reading their datasheets.
