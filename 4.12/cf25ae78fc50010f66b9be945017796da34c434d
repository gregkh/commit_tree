md/raid10: wait up frozen array in handle_write_completed

Since nr_queued is changed, we need to call wake_up here
if the array is already frozen and waiting for condition
"nr_pending == nr_queued + extra" to be true.

And commit 824e47daddbf ("RAID1: avoid unnecessary spin
locks in I/O barrier code") which has already added the
wake_up for raid1.
