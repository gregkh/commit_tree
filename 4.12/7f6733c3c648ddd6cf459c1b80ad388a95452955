srcu: Make rcutorture writer stalls print SRCU GP state

In the past, SRCU was simple enough that there was little point in
making the rcutorture writer stall messages print the SRCU grace-period
number state.  With the advent of Tree SRCU, this has changed.  This
commit therefore makes Classic, Tiny, and Tree SRCU report this state
to rcutorture as needed.
