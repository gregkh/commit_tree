staging: ks7010: clean memory allocation

Memory allocation code contains unneeded debug statements, failed
kmalloc() calls typically do not require a debug message. Introduction
of a local 'size' variable allows kmalloc() call to be marginally
cleaner, still uses magic numbers but these require a more substantial
fix. Moving the magic numbers onto a single line opens the way for
further refactoring.

Clean memory allocation code, remove debug statements.
