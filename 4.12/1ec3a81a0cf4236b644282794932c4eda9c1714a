ftrace: Have each function probe use its own ftrace_ops

Have the function probes have their own ftrace_ops, and remove the
trace_probe_ops. This simplifies some of the ftrace infrastructure code.

Individual entries for each function is still allocated for the use of the
output for set_ftrace_filter, but they will be removed soon too.
