Revert "ARM: dts: qcom: msm8974: Add USB gadget nodes"

This reverts commit 769907ae6e6c2871c2ba4f578814d86fbfbe8d91.

This change caused issues with people using USB gadget for serial
consoles.  In addition, with the other USB changes coming in, it
makes sense to revert this patch and apply the new set as it
becomes ready.
