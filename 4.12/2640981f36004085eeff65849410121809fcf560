drm: document drm_ioctl.[hc]

Also unify/merge with the existing stuff.

I was a bit torn where to put this, but in the end I decided to put
all the ioctl/sysfs/debugfs stuff into drm-uapi.rst. That means we
have a bit a split with the other uapi related stuff used internally,
like drm_file.[hc], but I think overall this makes more sense.

If it's too confusing we can always add more cross-links to make it
more discoverable. But the auto-sprinkling of links kernel-doc already
does seems sufficient.

Also for prettier docs and more cross-links, switch the internal
defines over to an enum, as usual.

v2: Update kerneldoc fro drm_compat_ioctl too (caught by 0day), plus a
bit more drive-by polish.

v3: Fix typo, spotted by xerpi on irc (Sergi).

v4: Add missing space in comment (Neil).
