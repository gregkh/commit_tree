selftests/ftrace: Add a testcase for many kprobe events

Add a testcase to test kprobes via ftrace interface
with many concurrent kprobe events.

This tries to add many kprobe events (up to 256) on
kernel functions. To avoid making ftrace-based
kprobes (kprobes on fentry), it skips first N bytes
(on x86 N=5, on ppc or arm N=4) of function entry.
After that, it enables all those events, disable it,
and remove it.

Since the unoptimization buffer reclaiming will
be delayed, after removing events, it will wait
enough time.
