[media] tveeprom: get rid of unused arg on tveeprom_hauppauge_analog()

tveeprom_hauppauge_analog() used to need the I2C adapter in
order to print debug messages. As it now uses pr_foo() facilities
since commit 6037b3ca28f4 ("[media] tveeprom: print log messages
using pr_foo()"), the first argument of the function is not
needed anymore.

So, get rid of it.
