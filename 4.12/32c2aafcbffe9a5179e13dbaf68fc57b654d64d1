staging: bcm2835-camera: select BCM2835_VCHIQ rather then depending on it.

Change the camera's dependency on BCM2835_VCHIQ to a select
since camera support is typically more important to people
then base VCHIQ(which they may not even know what it's for).

Also, with a dependency the camera support would not be
visiable until VCHIQ is selected first, and that may
not be what most people would expect.
