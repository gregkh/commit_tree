staging: ks7010: refactor newly separated function

Checkpatch emits various warnings and checks;

WARNING: Avoid multiple line dereference
CHECK: Alignment should match open parenthesis
WARNING: line over 80 characters
CHECK: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

These are all whitespace fixes.

Refactor whitespace inline with kernel coding style. Fix various
checkpatch warnings.
