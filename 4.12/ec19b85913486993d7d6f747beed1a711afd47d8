ftrace: Move the probe function into the tracing directory

As nothing outside the tracing directory uses the function probes mechanism,
I'm moving the prototypes out of the include/linux/ftrace.h and into the
local kernel/trace/trace.h header. I plan on making them hook to the
trace_array structure which is local to kernel/trace, and I do not want to
expose it to the rest of the kernel. This requires that the probe functions
must also be local to tracing. But luckily nothing else uses them.
