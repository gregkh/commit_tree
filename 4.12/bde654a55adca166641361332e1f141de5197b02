usb: hcd: use correct device pointer for dma ops

commit a8c06e407ef9 ("usb: separate out sysdev pointer from
usb_bus") converted to use hcd->self.sysdev for DMA
operations instead of hcd->self.controller but forgot to do
it for one instance.

This gets caught when DMA debugging is enabled since dma map
and unmap end up using different device pointers.

Fix it.
