[media] v4l: Allow calling v4l2_device_register_subdev_nodes() multiple times

Previously multiple calls to v4l2_device_register_subdev_nodes() ended up
corrupting memory and leaking some, too. This patch changes the behaviour so
that sub-devices the device nodes of which are already registered are
ignored.
