btrfs: delete unused member nobarriers

The last consumer of nobarriers is removed by the commit [1] and sync
won't fail with EOPNOTSUPP anymore. Thus, now when write cache is write
through it just return success without actually transpiring such a
request to the block device/lun.

[1]
commit b25de9d6da49b1a8760a89672283128aa8c78345
block: remove BIO_EOPNOTSUPP

And, as the device/lun write cache state may change dynamically saving
such as state won't help either. So deleting the member nobarriers.
