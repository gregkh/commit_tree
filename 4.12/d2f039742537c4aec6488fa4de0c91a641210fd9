s390/dump_stack: remove whitespace from arch description

The arch description provided for the "Hardware name:" contains lots
of extra whitespace due to the way the SYSIB contents are defined
(strings aren't zero terminated).
This looks a bit odd and therefore remove the extra whitespace
characters. This also gives the opportunity to add more information,
if required, without hitting the magic 80 characters per line limit.
