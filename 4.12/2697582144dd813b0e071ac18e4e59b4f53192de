net: mvpp2: handle misc PPv2.1/PPv2.2 differences

This commit handles a few miscellaneous differences between PPv2.1 and
PPv2.2 in different areas, where code done for PPv2.1 doesn't apply for
PPv2.2 or needs to be adjusted (getting the MAC address, disabling PHY
polling, etc.).

Thanks to Russell King for providing the initial implementation of
mvpp22_port_mii_set().
