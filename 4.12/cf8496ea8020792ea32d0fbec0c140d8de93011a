Show MADV_FREE pages info of each vma in smaps.  The interface is for
diganose or monitoring purpose, userspace could use it to understand
what happens in the application.  Since userspace could dirty MADV_FREE
pages without notice from kernel, this interface is the only place we
can get accurate accounting info about MADV_FREE pages.
