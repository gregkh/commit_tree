rcu: Open-code the rcu_cblist_n_cbs() function

Because the rcu_cblist_n_cbs() just samples the ->len counter, and
because the rcu_cblist structure is quite straightforward, it makes
sense to open-code rcu_cblist_n_cbs(p) as p->len, cutting out a level
of indirection.  This commit makes this change.
