security: use READ_ONCE instead of deprecated ACCESS_ONCE

With the new standardized functions, we can replace all ACCESS_ONCE()
calls across relevant security/keyrings/.

ACCESS_ONCE() does not work reliably on non-scalar types. For example
gcc 4.6 and 4.7 might remove the volatile tag for such accesses during
the SRA (scalar replacement of aggregates) step:

https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58145

Update the new calls regardless of if it is a scalar type, this is
cleaner than having three alternatives.
