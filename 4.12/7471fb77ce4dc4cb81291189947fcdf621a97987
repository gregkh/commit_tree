md/raid6: Fix anomily when recovering a single device in RAID6.

When recoverying a single missing/failed device in a RAID6,
those stripes where the Q block is on the missing device are
handled a bit differently.  In these cases it is easy to
check that the P block is correct, so we do.  This results
in the P block be destroy.  Consequently the P block needs
to be read a second time in order to compute Q.  This causes
lots of seeks and hurts performance.

It shouldn't be necessary to re-read P as it can be computed
from the DATA.  But we only compute blocks on missing
devices, since c337869d9501 ("md: do not compute parity
unless it is on a failed drive").

So relax the change made in that commit to allow computing
of the P block in a RAID6 which it is the only missing that
block.

This makes RAID6 recovery run much faster as the disk just
"before" the recovering device is no longer seeking
back-and-forth.
