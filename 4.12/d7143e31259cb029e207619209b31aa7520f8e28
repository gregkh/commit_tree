mm: correct the comment when reclaimed pages exceed the scanned pages

Commit e1587a494540 ("mm: vmpressure: fix sending wrong events on
underflow") declared that reclaimed pages exceed the scanned pages due
to the thp reclaim.

That is incorrect because THP will be spilt to normal page and loop
again, which will result in the scanned pages increment.
