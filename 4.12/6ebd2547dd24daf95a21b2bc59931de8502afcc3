perf annotate: Fix a bug following symbolic link of a build-id file

It is wrong way to read link name from a build-id file.  Because a
build-id file is not anymore a symbolic link but build-id directory of
it is symbolic link, so fix it.

For example, if build-id file name gotten from
dso__build_id_filename() is as below,

  /root/.debug/.build-id/4f/75c7d197c951659d1c1b8b5fd49bcdf8f3f8b1/elf

To correctly read link name of build-id, use the build-id dir path that
is a symbolic link, instead of the above build-id file name like below.

  /root/.debug/.build-id/4f/75c7d197c951659d1c1b8b5fd49bcdf8f3f8b1
