mm: remove SWAP_AGAIN in ttu

In 2002, [1] introduced SWAP_AGAIN.  At that time, try_to_unmap_one used
spin_trylock(&mm->page_table_lock) so it's really easy to contend and
fail to hold a lock so SWAP_AGAIN to keep LRU status makes sense.

However, now we changed it to mutex-based lock and be able to block
without skip pte so there is few of small window to return SWAP_AGAIN so
remove SWAP_AGAIN and just return SWAP_FAIL.
