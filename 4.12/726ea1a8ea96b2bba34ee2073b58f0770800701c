goldfish_pipe: An implementation of more parallel pipe

This is a driver code for a redesigned android pipe.
Currently it works for x86 and x64 emulators with the following
performance results:
  ADB push to /dev/null,
  Ubuntu,
  400 MB file,
  times are for (1 / 10 / 100) parallel adb commands
x86 adb push: (4.4s / 11.5s / 2m10s) -> (2.8s / 6s / 51s)
x64 adb push: (7s / 15s / (too long, 6m+) -> (2.7s / 6.2s / 52s)

ADB pull and push to /data/ have the same %% of speedup
More importantly, I don't see any signs of slowdowns when
run in parallel with Antutu benchmark, so it is definitely
making much better job at multithreading.
