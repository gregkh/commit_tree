powerpc/64s: Clean up machine check recovery flushing

Use the flush function introduced with the POWER9 machine check handler
for POWER7 and 8, rather than open coding it multiple times in callers.

There is a specific ERAT flush type introduced for POWER9, but the
POWER7-8 ERAT errors continue to do SLB flushing (which also flushes
ERAT), so as not to introduce functional changes with this cleanup
patch.
