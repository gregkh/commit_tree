ACPI / video: get rid of magic numbers and use enum instead

The first two items in the _BCL method response are special:

  - Level when machine has full power
  - Level when machine is on batteries
  - .... actual supported levels go there ....

So this commits adds an enum and uses its descriptive elements
throughout the code, instead of magic numbers.
