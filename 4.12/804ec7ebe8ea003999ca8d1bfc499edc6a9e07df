sctp: fix ICMP processing if skb is non-linear

sometimes ICMP replies to INIT chunks are ignored by the client, even if
the encapsulated SCTP headers match an open socket. This happens when the
ICMP packet is carried by a paged skb: use skb_header_pointer() to read
packet contents beyond the SCTP header, so that chunk header and initiate
tag are validated correctly.

v2:
- don't use skb_header_pointer() to read the transport header, since
  icmp_socket_deliver() already puts these 8 bytes in the linear area.
- change commit message to make specific reference to INIT chunks.
