i40e: restore default input set for each flow type

Ensure that the default input set is correctly reprogrammed when
cleaning up after disabling flow director support. This ensures that the
programmed value will be in a clean state.

Although we do not yet have support for SCTPv4 filters, a future patch
will add support for this protocol, so we will correctly restore the
SCTPv4 input set here as well. Note that strictly speaking the default
hardware value for SCTP includes matching the verification tag. However,
the ethtool API does not have support for specifying this value, so
there is no reason to keep the verification field enabled.

This patch is the next step on the way to enabling partial tuple filters
which will be implemented in a following patch.
