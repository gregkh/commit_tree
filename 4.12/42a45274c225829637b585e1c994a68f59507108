nvme-fabrics: Allow ctrl loss timeout configuration

When a host sense that its controller session is damaged,
it tries to re-establish it periodically (reconnect every
reconnect_delay). It may very well be that the controller
is gone and never coming back, in this case the host will
try to reconnect forever.

Add a ctrl_loss_tmo to bound the number of reconnect attempts
to a specific controller (default to a reasonable 10 minutes).
The timeout configuration is actually translated into number of
reconnect attempts and not a schedule on its own but rather
divided with reconnect_delay. This is useful to prevent
racing flows of remove and reconnect, and it doesn't really
matter if we remove slightly sooner than what the user requested.
