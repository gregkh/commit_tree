staging: fbtft: fb_sh1106: use own implementation of write_register

The default implementation of write_register keeps DC low for the first
byte only. SH1106 requires DC to be low for all bytes of a multi-byte
command. To deal with this limitation we currently use a separate call
to write_reg for each single command byte what is not really efficient.

Therefore override the default implementation of write_register with an
own one which keeps DC low for all bytes.
