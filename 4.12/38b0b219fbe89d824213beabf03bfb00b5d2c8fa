of: add devm_ functions for populate and depopulate

Lots of calls to of_platform_populate() are not unbalanced by a call
to of_platform_depopulate(). This create issues while drivers are
bind/unbind.

In way to solve those issues is to add devm_of_platform_populate()
which will call of_platform_depopulate() when the device is unbound
from the bus.
