staging: speakup: move spk_stop_serial_interrupt into synth-specific release function

This moves call to spk_stop_serial_interrupt() function out of synth_release()
and into release() method of specific spk_synth instances. This is because
the spk_stop_serial_interrupt() call is specific to current serial i/o
implementation. Moving it into each synth's release() method gives the
decision of calling  spk_stop_serial_interrupt() to that synth.
