drm: tilcdc: use vblank hooks in struct drm_crtc_funcs

The vblank hooks in struct drm_driver are deprecated and only meant for
legacy drivers.  For modern drivers with DRIVER_MODESET flag, the hooks
in struct drm_crtc_funcs should be used instead.

While at it, the 'return' of .disable_vblank is dropped to fix the
following checkpatch warning.

 WARNING: void function return statements are not generally useful
