spi: davinci: Use SPI framework to handle DMA mapping

Uppers layers like MTD can pass vmalloc'd buffers to the SPI driver,
and the current implementation will fail to map these kind of buffers.
The SPI framework is able to detect the best way to handle and map
buffers.
This commit updates the davinci SPI driver in order to use the SPI
framework to handle the DMA mapping of buffers coming from an upper
layer.
