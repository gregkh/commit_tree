mtd: nand: denali: remove unused CONFIG option and macros

All of these macros are not used at all.
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_DENALI_SCRATCH_REG_ADDR is not used for anything but
defining SCRATCH_REG_ADDR.  The config option should go away as well.

I am removing some register macros.  They are not used, and do not
exist in recent IP versions.
