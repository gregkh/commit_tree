i40e/i40evf: Break i40e_fetch_rx_buffer up to allow for reuse of frag code

This patch is meant to clean up the code in preparation for us adding
support for build_skb.  Specifically we deconstruct i40e_fetch_buffer into
several functions so that those functions can later be reused when we add a
path for build_skb.

Specifically with this change we split out the code for adding a page to an
exiting skb.
