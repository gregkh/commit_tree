pstore: Fix flags to enable dumps on powerpc

After commit c950fd6f201a kernel registers pstore write based on flag set.
Pstore write for powerpc is broken as flags(PSTORE_FLAGS_DMESG) is not set for
powerpc architecture. On panic, kernel doesn't write message to
/fs/pstore/dmesg*(Entry doesn't gets created at all).

This patch enables pstore write for powerpc architecture by setting
PSTORE_FLAGS_DMESG flag.
