xdp: add flag to enforce driver mode

After commit b5cdae3291f7 ("net: Generic XDP") we automatically fall
back to a generic XDP variant if the driver does not support native
XDP. Allow for an option where the user can specify that always the
native XDP variant should be selected and in case it's not supported
by a driver, just bail out.
