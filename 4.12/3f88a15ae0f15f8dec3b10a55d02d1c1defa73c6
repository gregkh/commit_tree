xfs: don't use bool values in trace buffers

Using bool values produces sparse warnings of this form:

fs/xfs/./xfs_trace.h:2252:1: warning: odd constant _Bool cast (ffffffffffffffff becomes 1)
fs/xfs/./xfs_trace.h:2252:1: warning: odd constant _Bool cast (ffffffffffffffff becomes 1)
fs/xfs/./xfs_trace.h:2278:1: warning: odd constant _Bool cast (ffffffffffffffff becomes 1)
fs/xfs/./xfs_trace.h:2278:1: warning: odd constant _Bool cast (ffffffffffffffff becomes 1)
fs/xfs/./xfs_trace.h:2307:1: warning: odd constant _Bool cast (ffffffffffffffff becomes 1)

Just use a char instead to fix those up.
