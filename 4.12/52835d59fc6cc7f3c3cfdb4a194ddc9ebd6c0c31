soc: ti: Add ti_sci_pm_domains driver

Introduce a ti_sci_pm_domains driver to act as a generic pm domain
provider to allow each device to attach and associate it's ti-sci-id so
that it can be controlled through the TI SCI protocol.

This driver implements a simple genpd where each device node has a
phandle to the power domain node and also must provide an index which
represents the ID to be passed with TI SCI representing the device using
a single phandle cell. The driver manually parses the phandle to get the
cell value. Through this interface the genpd dev_ops start and stop
hooks will use TI SCI to turn on and off each device as determined by
pm_runtime usage.
