KVM: s390: fix stale machine check data for guarded storage

When delivering a machine check the CPU state is "loaded", which
means that some registers are already in the host registers.
Before writing the register content into the machine check
save area, we must make sure that we save the content of the
registers into the data structures that are used for delivering
the machine check.
We already do the right thing for access, vector/floating point
registers, let's do the same for guarded storage.
