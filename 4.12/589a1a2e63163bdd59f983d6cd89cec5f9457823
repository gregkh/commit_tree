stmmac: use netif_set_real_num_{rx,tx}_queues

A driver must not access the two fields directly but should instead use
the helper functions to set the values and keep a consistent internal
state:

ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c: In function 'stmmac_dvr_probe':
ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:4083:8: error: 'struct net_device' has no member named 'real_num_rx_queues'; did you mean 'real_num_tx_queues'?
