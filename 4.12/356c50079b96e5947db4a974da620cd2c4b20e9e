usb: orion-ehci: Add support for the Armada 3700

- Add a new compatible string for the Armada 3700 SoCs

- add sbuscfg support for orion usb controller driver. For the SoCs
  without hlock, need to program BAWR/BARD/AHBBRST fields in the sbuscfg
  register to guarantee the AHB master's burst would not overrun or
  underrun the FIFO.

- the sbuscfg register has to be set after the usb controller reset,
  otherwise the value would be overridden to 0. In order to do this, the
  reset callback is registered.
