ASoC: rsnd: don't use PDTA bit for 24bit on SSI

Current SSI uses PDTA bit which indicates data that Input/Output
data are Right-Aligned. But, 24bit sound should be Left-Aligned
in this HW. Because Linux is using Right-Aligned data, and HW uses
Left-Aligned data, current 24bit data is missing lower 8bit.
To fix this issue, this patch removes PDTA bit, and shift 8bit
in necessary module
