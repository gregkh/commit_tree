cpufreq: User/admin documentation update and consolidation

The user/admin documentation of cpufreq is badly outdated.  It
conains stale and/or inaccurate information along with things
that are not particularly useful.  Also, some of the important
pieces are missing from it.

For this reason, add a new user/admin document for cpufreq
containing current information to admin-guide and drop the old
outdated .txt documents it is replacing.

Since there will be more PM documents in admin-guide going forward,
create a separate directory for them and put the cpufreq document
in there right away.
