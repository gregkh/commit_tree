drm/omap: improve DPI clock selection on DRA7xx

The clock source selection for the LCD outputs is too hardcoded at the
moment. For example, LCD3 is set to use PLL2_1, and PLL2 doesn't exist
on DRA72x SoCs.

There are quite many ways to configure the clocks, even using HDMI PLL
for LCD outputs, but enabling full configuration of the clocks is rather
tricky.

This patch improves the situation a bit by checking if the PLL about to
be used exists, and if not, tries another one.
