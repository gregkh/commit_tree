power: supply: cpcap-charger: Fix charge voltage configuration

We have the charge voltage wrong, it should be 4.35V instead of 4.2V.
This will cause the battery to never get fully charged.

I noticed this when looking at the Andoid kernel battery and charger
status for a fully charged battery:

POWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_NOW=4351000

Also the battery on droid 4 says "4.35, 1735/1785mAh (min/typ),
6.6/6.8 Wh (min/typ)". Presumably the 4.35 on the battery is the
charge voltage.

And finally, on Android the CPCAP CRM register is set to 0x03b5 where
the b is the charge voltage.

Let's fix the charge voltage define and update the charge configuration
to use the 4.35V setting.
