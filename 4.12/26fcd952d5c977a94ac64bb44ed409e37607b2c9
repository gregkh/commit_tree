x86/mshyperv: Remove excess #includes from mshyperv.h

A recent commit included linux/slab.h in linux/irq.h. This breaks the build
of vdso32 on a 64-bit kernel.

The reason is that linux/irq.h gets included into the vdso code via
linux/interrupt.h which is included from asm/mshyperv.h. That makes the
32-bit vdso compile fail, because slab.h includes the pgtable headers for
64-bit on a 64-bit build.

Neither linux/clocksource.h nor linux/interrupt.h are needed in the
mshyperv.h header file itself - it has a dependency on <linux/atomic.h>.

Remove the includes and unbreak the build.
