tools/power/x86/intel_pstate_tracer: Adjust directory ownership

The intel_pstate_tracer.py script only needs to be run as root
when it is also used to actually acquire the trace data that
it will post process. Otherwise it is generally preferable
that it be run as a regular user.
If run the first time as root the results directory will be
incorrect for any subsequent run as a regular user. For any run
as root the specific testname subdirectory will not allow any
subsequent file saves by a regular user. Typically, and for example,
the regular user might be attempting to save a .csv file converted to
a spreadsheet with added calculations or graphs.

Set the directories and files owner and groups IDs to be the regular
user, if required.
