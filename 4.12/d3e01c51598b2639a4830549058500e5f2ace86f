arm: dma-mapping: Reset the device's dma_ops

arch_teardown_dma_ops() being the inverse of arch_setup_dma_ops()
,dma_ops should be cleared in the teardown path. Currently, only the
device's iommu mapping structures are cleared in arch_teardown_dma_ops,
but not the dma_ops. So on the next reprobe, dma_ops left in place is
stale from the first IOMMU setup, but iommu mappings has been disposed
of. This is a problem when the probe of the device is deferred and
recalled with the IOMMU probe deferral.

So for fixing this, slightly refactor by moving the code from
__arm_iommu_detach_device to arm_iommu_detach_device and cleanup
the former. This takes care of resetting the dma_ops in the teardown
path.
