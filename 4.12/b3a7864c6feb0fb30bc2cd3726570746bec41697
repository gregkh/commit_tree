powerpc/ftrace: Add prototype for prepare_ftrace_return()

Sparse emits a warning: symbol 'prepare_ftrace_return' was not
declared. Should it be static? prepare_ftrace_return() is called from
assembler and should not be static.

Add a prototype for it to asm-prototypes.h and include that in ftrace.c.
