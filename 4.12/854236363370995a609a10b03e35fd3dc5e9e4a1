MIPS: Avoid accidental raw backtrace

Since commit 81a76d7119f6 ("MIPS: Avoid using unwind_stack() with
usermode") show_backtrace() invokes the raw backtracer when
cp0_status & ST0_KSU indicates user mode to fix issues on EVA kernels
where user and kernel address spaces overlap.

However this is used by show_stack() which creates its own pt_regs on
the stack and leaves cp0_status uninitialised in most of the code paths.
This results in the non deterministic use of the raw back tracer
depending on the previous stack content.

show_stack() deals exclusively with kernel mode stacks anyway, so
explicitly initialise regs.cp0_status to KSU_KERNEL (i.e. 0) to ensure
we get a useful backtrace.
