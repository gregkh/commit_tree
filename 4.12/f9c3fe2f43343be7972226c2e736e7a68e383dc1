qlcnic: Fix link configuration with autoneg disabled

Currently driver returns error on speed configurations
for 83xx adapter's non XGBE ports, due to this link doesn't
come up on the ports using 1000Base-T as a connector with
autoneg disabled. This patch fixes this with initializing
appropriate port type based on queried module/connector
types from hardware before any speed/autoneg configuration.
