net: hns: support deferred probe when can not obtain irq

In the hip06 and hip07 SoCs, the interrupt lines from the
DSAF controllers are connected to mbigen hw module.
The mbigen module is probed with module_init, and, as such,
is not guaranteed to probe before the HNS driver. So we need
to support deferred probe.
