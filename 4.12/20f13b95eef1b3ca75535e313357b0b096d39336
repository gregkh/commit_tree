powerpc/powernv/npu: Remove dead iommu code

PNV_IODA_PE_DEV is only used for NPU devices (emulated PCI bridges
representing NVLink). These are added to IOMMU groups with corresponding
NVIDIA devices after all non-NPU PEs are setup; a special helper -
pnv_pci_ioda_setup_iommu_api() - handles this in pnv_pci_ioda_fixup().

The pnv_pci_ioda2_setup_dma_pe() helper sets up DMA for a PE. It is called
for VFs (so it does not handle NPU case) and PCI bridges but only
IODA1 and IODA2 types. An NPU bridge has its own type id (PNV_PHB_NPU)
so pnv_pci_ioda2_setup_dma_pe() cannot be called on NPU and therefore
(pe->flags & PNV_IODA_PE_DEV) is always "false".

This removes not used iommu_add_device(). This should not cause any
behavioral change.
