ceph: choose readdir frag based on previous readdir reply

The dirfragtree is lazily updated, it's not always accurate. Infinite
loops happens in following circumstance.

- client send request to read frag A
- frag A has been fragmented into frag B and C. So mds fills the reply
  with contents of frag B
- client wants to read next frag C. ceph_choose_frag(frag value of C)
  return frag A.

The fix is using previous readdir reply to calculate next readdir frag
when possible.
