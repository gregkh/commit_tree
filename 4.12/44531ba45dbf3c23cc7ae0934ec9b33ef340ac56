qed: Fix TM block ILT allocation

When configuring the HW timers block we should set the number of CIDs
up until the last CID that require timers, instead of only those CIDs
whose protocol needs timers support.

Today, the protocols that require HW timers' support have their CIDs
before any other protocol, but that would change in future [when we
add iWARP support].
