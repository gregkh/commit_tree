iwlwifi: mvm: remove references to queue_info in new TX path

Most of the fields aren't needed in new TX path.
Enlarging the struct to 512 queues will consume a lot of memory.
Remove all references to the struct in the new TX path.
Move mac80211 queue mapping outside, since it will be needed per
queue for TVQM mode.
Add warning in paths that shouldn't be hit.
