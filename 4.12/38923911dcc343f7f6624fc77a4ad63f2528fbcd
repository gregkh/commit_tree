iio:core: utilize new cdev_device_add helper function

Replace the open coded registration of the cdev and dev with the
new device_add_cdev() helper. The helper replaces a common pattern by
taking the proper reference against the parent device and adding both
the cdev and the device.

In doing so we have to remove a guard statement from cdev_del,
but this doesn't appear to be required in any way.
