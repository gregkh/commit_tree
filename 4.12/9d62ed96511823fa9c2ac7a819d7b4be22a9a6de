libnvdimm: handle locked label storage areas

Per the latest version of the "NVDIMM DSM Interface Example" [1], the
label data retrieval routine can report a "locked" status. In this case
all regions associated with that DIMM are disabled until the label area
is unlocked. Provide generic libnvdimm enabling for NVDIMMs with label
data area locking capabilities.
