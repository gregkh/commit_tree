perf script python: Remove dups in documentation examples

Few shell command examples in perf-script-python.txt has few nitpicks
include:

- tools/perf/scripts/python directory listing command is unnecessarily
  repeated.
- few examples contain additional information in command prompt
  unnecessarily and inconsistently.

This commit fixes them to enhance readability of the document.
