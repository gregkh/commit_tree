s390/spinlock: remove compare and delay instruction

The CAD instruction never worked quite as expected for the spinlock
code. It has been disabled by default with git commit 61b0b01686d48220,
if the "cad" kernel parameter is specified it is enabled for both user
space and the spinlock code. Leave the option to enable the instruction
for user space but remove it from the spinlock code.
