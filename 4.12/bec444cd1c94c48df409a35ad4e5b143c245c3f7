USB: hub: fix non-SS hub-descriptor handling

Add missing sanity check on the non-SuperSpeed hub-descriptor length in
order to avoid parsing and leaking two bytes of uninitialised slab data
through sysfs removable-attributes (or a compound-device debug
statement).

Note that we only make sure that the DeviceRemovable field is always
present (and specifically ignore the unused PortPwrCtrlMask field) in
order to continue support any hubs with non-compliant descriptors. As a
further safeguard, the descriptor buffer is also cleared.
