gpu: ipu-v3: Fix CSI selection for VDIC

The description of the CSI_SEL bit in the i.MX6 reference manual is
incorrect. It states "This bit defines which CSI is the input to the
IC. This bit is effective only if IC_INPUT is bit cleared".

From experiment it was found this is in fact not correct. The CSI_SEL
bit selects which CSI is input to _both_ the VDIC _and_ the IC. If the
IC_INPUT bit is set so that the IC is receiving from the VDIC, the IC
ignores the CSI_SEL bit, but CSI_SEL still selects which CSI the VDIC
receives from in that case.
