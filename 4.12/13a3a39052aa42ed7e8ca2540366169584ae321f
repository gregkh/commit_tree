iwlwifi: pcie: alloc queues dynamically

Change queue allocation to be dynamic. On transport init only
the command queue is being allocated. Other queues are allocated
on demand.
This is due to the huge amount of queues we will soon enable (512)
and as a preparation for TX Virtual Queue Manager feature (TVQM),
where firmware will assign the actual queue number on demand.
This includes also allocation of the byte count table per queue
and not as a contiguous chunk of memory.
