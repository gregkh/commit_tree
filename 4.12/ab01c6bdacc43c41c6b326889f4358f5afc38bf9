KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Implement vgic_mmio_uaccess_write_its_iidr

The GITS_IIDR revision field is used to encode the migration ABI
revision. So we need to restore it to check the table layout is
readable by the destination.

By writing the IIDR, userspace thus forces the ABI revision to be
used and this must be less than or equal to the max revision KVM
supports.
