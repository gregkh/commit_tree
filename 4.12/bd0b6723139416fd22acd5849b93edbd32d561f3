ibmvnic: Move login and queue negotiation into ibmvnic_open

VNIC server expects LINK_STATE_UP to be sent within 30s of the login. If we
exceed the timeout, VNIC server will attempt to fail over. Since time
between probe and open of the device is indeterminate, move login and queue
negotiation into ibmvnic open so we can guarantee that login and sending
LINK_STATE_UP occur within the 30s window.
