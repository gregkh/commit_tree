drm/i915: Make intel_detect_preproduction_hw easier to extend

As we add new generations, we should keep detecting new pre-production
system development platforms that were temporarily enabled to facilitate
initial development and now superseded by production systems. To make
it easier to add more platforms, split the if into a series of logical
operations.

v2: s/sdv/pre/ - not all system development vehicles are for
preproduction usage.
