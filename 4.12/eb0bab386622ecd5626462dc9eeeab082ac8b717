MIPS: Add some missing guest CP0 accessors & defs

Add some missing guest accessors and register field definitions for KVM
for MIPS VZ to make use of.

Guest CP0_LLAddr register accessors and definitions for the LLB field
allow KVM to clear the guest LLB to cancel in-progress LL/SC atomics on
restore, and to emulate accesses by the guest to the CP0_LLAddr
register.

Bitwise modifiers and definitions for the guest CP0_Wired and
CP0_Config1 registers allow KVM to modify fields within the CP0_Wired
and CP0_Config1 registers.

Finally a definition for the CP0_Config5.SBRI bit allows KVM to
initialise and allow modification of the guest version of the SBRI bit.
