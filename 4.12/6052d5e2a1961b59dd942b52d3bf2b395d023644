ibmvnic: Insert header on VLAN tagged received frame

This patch addresses a modification in the PAPR+ specification which now
defines a previously reserved value for vNIC capabilities. It indicates
whether the system firmware performs a VLAN header stripping on all VLAN
tagged received frames, in case it does, the behavior expected is for
the ibmvnic driver to be responsible for inserting the VLAN header.
