IB/mlx4: Fix incorrect order of formal and actual parameters

The last two actual parameters when calling id_map_find_by_sl_id()
from id_map_get() are swapped. However, the same formal parameters to
id_map_get() have them swapped as well, inverting the effect of the
first error.

This commit improves readability, but makes no functional change to
the code.
