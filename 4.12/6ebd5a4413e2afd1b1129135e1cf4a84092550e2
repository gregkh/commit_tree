xfs: introduce xfs_bmapi_remap

Add a new helper to be used for reflink extent list additions instead of
funneling them through xfs_bmapi_write and overloading the firstblock
member in struct xfs_bmalloca and struct xfs_alloc_args.

With some small changes to xfs_bmap_remap_alloc this also means we do
not need a xfs_bmalloca structure for this case at all.
