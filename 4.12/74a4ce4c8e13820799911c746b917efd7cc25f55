ASoC: intel: remove unused variable data and associated code

The variable 'data' is assigned null and never re-assigned. There
is also a redundant check for data being non-null which is always
false, so remove this and the variable data and dma_addr as they
are not used once the dead code has been removed.

Detected with CoverityScan, CID#1324015 ("'Constant' variable gaurds
dead code")
