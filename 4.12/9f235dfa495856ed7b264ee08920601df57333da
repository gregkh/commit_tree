drm/i915: Consolidate gen8_emit_pipe_control

We have a few open coded instances in the execlists code and an
almost suitable helper in intel_ringbuf.c

We can consolidate to a single helper if we change the existing
helper to emit directly to ring buffer memory and move the space
reservation outside it.

v2: Drop memcpy for memset. (Chris Wilson)
