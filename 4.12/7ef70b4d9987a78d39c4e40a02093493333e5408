btrfs: preallocate radix tree node for global readahead tree

We can preallocate the node so insertion does not have to do that under
the lock. The GFP flags for the global radix tree are initialized to
 GFP_NOFS & ~__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM
but we can use GFP_KERNEL, because readahead is optional and not on any
critical writeout path.
