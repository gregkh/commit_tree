HID: sony: Treat the ds4 dongle as a separate device

This patch adds a new quirk, which allows us to differentiate
between the DualShock 4 USB and the dongle. So far they have
been treated the same, but handling of calibration data differs
as the dongle behaves like Bluetooth, for other requests it
behaves like USB.

In addition this patches changes usb/dongle/bt handling in
sony_raw_event, which makes the code cleaner to read. In addition
another patch in this series will add more dongle logic, so this
change paves the road for that.
