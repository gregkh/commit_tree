scsi: MAINTAINERS: update OSD entries

The open-osd domain doesn't exist anymore, and mails to the list lead to
really annoying bounced that repeat every day.

Also the primarydata address for Benny bounces, and while I have a new
one for him he doesn't seem to be maintaining the OSD code any more.

Which beggs the question: should we really leave the Supported status in
MAINTAINERS given that the code is barely maintained?
