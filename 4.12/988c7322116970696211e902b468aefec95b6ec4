sctp: return next obj by passing pos + 1 into sctp_transport_get_idx

In sctp_for_each_transport, pos is used to save how many objs it has
dumped. Now it gets the last obj by sctp_transport_get_idx, then gets
the next obj by sctp_transport_get_next.

The issue is that in the meanwhile if some objs in transport hashtable
are removed and the objs nums are less than pos, sctp_transport_get_idx
would return NULL and hti.walker.tbl is NULL as well. At this moment
it should stop hti, instead of continue getting the next obj. Or it
would cause a NULL pointer dereference in sctp_transport_get_next.

This patch is to pass pos + 1 into sctp_transport_get_idx to get the
next obj directly, even if pos > objs nums, it would return NULL and
stop hti.
