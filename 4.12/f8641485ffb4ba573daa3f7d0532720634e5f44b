staging: ks7010: fix function return code path

Function has duplicate code clean up sequences; identical function
call followed by return. This would be better expressed with the use
of a goto statement, as is typical in-tree.

One call site places the clean up code within the 'else' branch of an
multi-way decision. This can be more clearly expressed by inverting
the initial decision conditional and jumping directly to the cleanup
code. Subsequent code indentation can then be reduced, aiding
readability.

Fix function return code execution path. Move clean up code to end of
function with a label. Replace duplicate clean up code within function
with a jump to label. Invert conditional, jump to label if new
conditional evaluates to true, reduce indentation in subsequent code.
