PCI/ACPI: Add ThunderX pass2.x 2nd node MCFG quirk

Currently SoCs pass2.x do not emulate EA headers for ACPI boot method at
all.  However, for pass2.x some devices (like EDAC) advertise incorrect
base addresses in their BARs which results in driver probe failure during
resource request.  Since all problematic blocks are on 2nd NUMA node under
domain 10 add necessary quirk entry to obtain BAR addresses correction
using EA header emulation.
