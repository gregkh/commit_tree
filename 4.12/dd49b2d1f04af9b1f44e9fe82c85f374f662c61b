ALSA: firewire-motu: add PCM functionality

This commit adds PCM functionality to transmit/receive PCM samples.

When one of PCM substreams are running or external clock source is
selected, current sampling rate is used. Else, the sampling rate is
changed according to requests from a userspace application.

Available number of samples in a frame of PCM substream is determined at
open(2) to corresponding PCM character device. Later, packet streaming
starts by ioctl(2) with SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_PREPARE. In theory, between them,
applications can change state of the unit by any write transaction to
change the number. In this case, this driver may fail packet streaming due
to wrong data format.
