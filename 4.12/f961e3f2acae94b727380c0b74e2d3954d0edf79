nfsd: encoders mustn't use unitialized values in error cases

In error cases, lgp->lg_layout_type may be out of bounds; so we
shouldn't be using it until after the check of nfserr.

This was seen to crash nfsd threads when the server receives a LAYOUTGET
request with a large layout type.

GETDEVICEINFO has the same problem.
