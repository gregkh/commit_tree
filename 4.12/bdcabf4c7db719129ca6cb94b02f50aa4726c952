rcu: Add single-element dequeue functions to rcu_segcblist

This commit adds single-element dequeue functions to rcu_segcblist.
These are less efficient than using the extract and insert functions,
but allow more precise debugging code.  These functions are thus
expected to be used only in debug builds, for example, CONFIG_PROVE_RCU.
