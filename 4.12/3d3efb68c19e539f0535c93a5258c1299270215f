KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Ignore timebase offset on POWER9 DD1

POWER9 DD1 has an erratum where writing to the TBU40 register, which
is used to apply an offset to the timebase, can cause the timebase to
lose counts.  This results in the timebase on some CPUs getting out of
sync with other CPUs, which then results in misbehaviour of the
timekeeping code.

To work around the problem, we make KVM ignore the timebase offset for
all guests on POWER9 DD1 machines.  This means that live migration
cannot be supported on POWER9 DD1 machines.
