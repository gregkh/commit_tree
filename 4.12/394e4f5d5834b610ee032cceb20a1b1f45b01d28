initramfs: avoid "label at end of compound statement" error

Commit 17a9be317475 ("initramfs: Always do fput() and load modules after
rootfs populate") introduced an error for the

    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y

case, because even though the code looks fine, the compiler really wants
a statement after a label, or you'll get complaints:

  init/initramfs.c: In function 'populate_rootfs':
  init/initramfs.c:644:2: error: label at end of compound statement

That commit moved the subsequent statements to outside the compound
statement, leaving the label without any associated statements.
