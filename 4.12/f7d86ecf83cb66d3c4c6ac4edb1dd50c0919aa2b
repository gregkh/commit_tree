iio: adc: bcm_iproc_adc: swap primary and secondary isr handler's

The third argument of devm_request_threaded_irq() is the primary
handler. It is called in hardirq context and checks whether the
interrupt is relevant to the device. If the primary handler returns
IRQ_WAKE_THREAD, the secondary handler (a.k.a. handler thread) is
scheduled to run in process context.

bcm_iproc_adc.c uses the secondary handler as the primary one
and the other way around. So this patch fixes the same, along with
re-naming the secondary handler and primary handler names properly.

Tested on the BCM9583XX iProc SoC based boards.
