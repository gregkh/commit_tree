arm64: efi: split Image code and data into separate PE/COFF sections

To prevent unintended modifications to the kernel text (malicious or
otherwise) while running the EFI stub, describe the kernel image as
two separate sections: a .text section with read-execute permissions,
covering .text, .rodata and .init.text, and a .data section with
read-write permissions, covering .init.data, .data and .bss.

This relies on the firmware to actually take the section permission
flags into account, but this is something that is currently being
implemented in EDK2, which means we will likely start seeing it in
the wild between one and two years from now.
