drivers/perf: arm_pmu: manage interrupts per-cpu

When requesting or freeing interrupts, we use platform_get_irq() to find
relevant irqs, backing this up with additional information in an
optional irq_affinity table.

This means that our irq request and free paths are tied to a
platform_device, and our request path must jump through a number of
hoops in order to determine the required affinity of each interrupt.

Given that the affinity must be static, we can compute the affinity once
up-front at probe time, simplifying the irq request and free paths. By
recording interrupts in a per-cpu data structure, we simplify a few
paths, and permit a subsequent rework of the request and free paths.
