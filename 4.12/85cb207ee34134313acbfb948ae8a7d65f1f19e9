nfp: don't completely refuse to work with old flashes

Right now the required Service Process ABI version is still tied
to max ID of known commands.  For new NSP commands we are adding
we are checking if NSP version is recent enough on command-by-command
basis.  The driver doesn't have to force the device to have the
very latest flash, anything newer than 0.8 should do.
