drm/vc4: Fulfill user BO creation requests from the kernel BO cache.

The from_cache flag was actually "the BO is invisible to userspace",
so we can repurpose it to just zero out a cached BO and return it to
userspace.

Improves wall time for a loop of 5 glsl-algebraic-add-add-1 by
-1.44989% +/- 0.862891% (n=28, 1 outlier removed from each that
appeared to be other system noise)

Note that there's an intel-gpu-tools test to check for the proper
zeroing behavior here, which we continue to pass.
