nvmet: Introduced helper routine for controller status check.

This patch introduces helper function for checking controller
status during admin and io command processing which returns u16
status. As to bring consistency on returning status, other
friend functions also now return u16 status instead of int
to match the spec.

As part of the theseerror log prints in also prints qid on
which command error occured.
