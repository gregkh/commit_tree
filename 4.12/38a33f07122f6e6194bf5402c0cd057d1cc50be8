tools include: Sync {,tools/}include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h

To get PERF_AUX_FLAG_PARTIAL, introduced in:

  ae0c2d995d64 ("perf/core: Add a flag for partial AUX records")

and that will be used to warn the user about gaps in AUX records due
to VMX being used in KVM guests.

Silences the kernel/tools file copy detector:

  Warning: include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h differs from kernel
