staging: ks7010: refactor, whitespace only

Code may be refactored to take advantage of previous patches which
reduced the level of indentation. Function parameter line breaks can
be adjusted in line with kernel coding standards.

Refactor layout of function call parameters. Make whitespace changes
only.
