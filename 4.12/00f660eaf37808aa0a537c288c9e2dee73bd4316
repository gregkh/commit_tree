Sample program using SO_COOKIE

Added a per socket traffic monitoring option to illustrate the usage
of new getsockopt SO_COOKIE. The program is based on the socket traffic
monitoring program using xt_eBPF and in the new option the data entry
can be directly accessed using socket cookie. The cookie retrieved
allow us to lookup an element in the eBPF for a specific socket.
