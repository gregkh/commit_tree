clocksource: h8300_timer8: Don't reset rate in ->set_state_oneshot()

With the upcoming NTP correction related rate adjustments to be implemented
in the clockevents core, the latter needs to get informed about every rate
change of a clockevent device made after its registration.

Currently, h8300_timer8 violates this requirement in that it registers its
clockevent device with the correct rate, but resets its ->mult and ->rate
values in timer8_clock_event_start(), called from its ->set_state_oneshot()
function.

It seems like
  commit 4633f4cac85a ("clocksource/drivers/h8300: Cleanup startup and
                        remove module code."),
which introduced the rate initialization at registration, missed to remove
the manual setting of ->mult and ->shift from timer8_clock_event_start().

Purge the setting of ->mult, ->shift, ->min_delta_ns and ->max_delta_ns
from timer8_clock_event_start().
