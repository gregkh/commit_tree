net: hns: Fix to adjust buf_size of ring according to mtu

Because buf_size of ring set to 2048, the process of rx_poll_one
can reuse the page, therefore the performance of XGE can improve.
But the chip only supports three bds in one package, so the max mtu
is 6K when it sets to 2048. For better performane in litter mtu, we
need change buf_size according to mtu.

When user change mtu, hns is only change the desc in memory. There
are some desc has been fetched by the chip, these desc can not be
changed by the code. So it needs set the port loopback and send
some packages to let the chip consumes the wrong desc and fetch new
desc.
Because the Pv660 do not support rss indirection, we need add version
check in mtu change process.
