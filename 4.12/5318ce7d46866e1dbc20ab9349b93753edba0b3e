bdi: Shutdown writeback on all cgwbs in cgwb_bdi_destroy()

Currently we waited for all cgwbs to get freed in cgwb_bdi_destroy()
which also means that writeback has been shutdown on them. Since this
wait is going away, directly shutdown writeback on cgwbs from
cgwb_bdi_destroy() to avoid live writeback structures after
bdi_unregister() has finished. To make that safe with concurrent
shutdown from cgwb_release_workfn(), we also have to make sure
wb_shutdown() returns only after the bdi_writeback structure is really
shutdown.
