initramfs: use vfs_stat/lstat directly

sys_newlstat is a system call implementation that is meant for user
space, and that copies kernel-internal data structure to the user
format, which is not needed for in-kernel users.

Further, as we rearrange the system call implementation so we can extend
it with 64-bit time_t, the prototype for sys_newlstat changes.

This changes the initramfs code to use vfs_lstat directly, to get it out
of the way of the time_t changes, and make it slightly more efficient in
the process.  Along the same lines we also replace sys_stat and
sys_stat64 with vfs_stat.
