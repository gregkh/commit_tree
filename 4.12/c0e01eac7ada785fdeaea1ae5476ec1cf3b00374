mlxsw: spectrum: Avoid possible NULL pointer dereference

In case we got an FDB notification for a port that doesn't exist we
execute an FDB entry delete to prevent it from re-appearing the next
time we poll for notifications.

If the operation failed we would trigger a NULL pointer dereference as
'mlxsw_sp_port' is NULL.

Fix it by reporting the error using the underlying bus device instead.
