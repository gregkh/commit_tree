KVM: x86: fix maintaining of kvm_clock stability on guest CPU hotplug

VCPU TSC synchronization is perfromed in kvm_write_tsc() when the TSC
value being set is within 1 second from the expected, as obtained by
extrapolating of the TSC in already synchronized VCPUs.

This is naturally achieved on all VCPUs at VM start and resume;
however on VCPU hotplug it is not: the newly added VCPU is created
with TSC == 0 while others are well ahead.

To compensate for that, consider host-initiated kvm_write_tsc() with
TSC == 0 a special case requiring synchronization regardless of the
current TSC on other VCPUs.
