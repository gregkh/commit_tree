livepatch: Cancel transition a safe way for immediate patches

klp_init_transition() does not set func->transition for immediate patches.
Then klp_ftrace_handler() could use the new code immediately. As a result,
it is not safe to put the livepatch module in klp_cancel_transition().

This patch reverts most of the last minute changes klp_cancel_transition().
It keeps the warning about a misuse because it still makes sense.
