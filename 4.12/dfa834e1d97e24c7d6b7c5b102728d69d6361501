IB/SA: Introduce path record specific types

struct sa_path_rec has a gid_type field. This patch introduces a more
generic path record specific type 'rec_type' which is either IB, ROCE v1
or ROCE v2. The patch also provides conversion functions to get
a gid type from a path record type and vice versa
