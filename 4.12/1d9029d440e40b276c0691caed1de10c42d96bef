ACPI/IORT: Add function to check SMMUs drivers presence

The IOMMU probe deferral implementation requires a mechanism to detect
if drivers for SMMU components are built-in in the kernel to detect
whether IOMMU configuration for a given device should be deferred (ie
SMMU drivers present but still not probed) or not (drivers not present).

Add a simple function to IORT to detect if SMMU drivers for SMMU
components managed by IORT are built-in in the kernel.
