ldmvsw: better use of link up and down on ldom vswitch

When an ldom VM is bound, the network vswitch infrastructure is set up for
it, but was being forced 'UP' by the userland switch configuration script.
When 'UP' but not actually connected to a running VM, the ipv6 neighbor
probes fail (not a horrible thing) and start cluttering up the kernel logs.
Funny thing: these are debug messages that never actually show up, but
we do see the net_ratelimited messages that say N callbacks were
suppressed.

This patch defers the netif_carrier_on() until an actual link has been
established with the VM, as indicated by receiving an LDC_EVENT_UP from
the underlying LDC protocol.  Similarly, we take the link down when we
see the LDC_EVENT_RESET.  Now when we see the ndo_open(), we reset the
link to get things talking again.
