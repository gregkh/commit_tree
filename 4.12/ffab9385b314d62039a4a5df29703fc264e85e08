acpi, nfit: add support for acpi 6.1 dimm state flags

Add support for the ACPI_NFIT_MEM_MAP_FAILED ("map_fail") and
ACPI_NFIT_MEM_HEALTH_ENABLED ("smart_notify") health state flags. The
"map_fail" flag identifies DIMMs that were not mapped into one or more
physical address ranges. The "health_notify" flag indicates whether
platform firmware will send notifications when there is new SMART health
data to consume.
