irqchip/gicv3-its: platform-msi: Refactor its_pmsi_prepare()

By adding ACPI support for platform MSI, the gicv3 driver has to
provide code to retrieve the dev id through ACPI instead of device
tree bindings; given that its_pmsi_prepare() allows already to get
the dev id but it is OF dependent, factor OF related code out into
a single function to make its_pmsi_prepare() ready to be used with
other firmware interfaces.
