clocksource: arm_arch_timer: refactor arch_timer_needs_probing

When booting with DT, it's possible for timer nodes to be probed in any
order. Some common initialisation needs to occur after all nodes have
been probed, and arch_timer_common_init() has code to detect when this
has happened.

This logic is DT-specific, and it would be best to factor it out of the
common code that will be shared with ACPI.

This patch folds this into the existing arch_timer_needs_probing(),
which is renamed to arch_timer_needs_of_probing(), and no longer takes
any arguments. This is only called when using DT, and not when using
ACPI, which will have a deterministic probe order.
