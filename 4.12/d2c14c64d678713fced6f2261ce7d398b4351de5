spi: loopback-test: fix potential integer overflow on multiple

A multiplication of 8U * xfer-len with the type of a 32 bit unsigned int
is evaluated using 32 bit arithmetic and then used in a context that
expects an expression of type unsigned long long (64 bits).  Avoid any
potential overflow by casting BITS_PER_BYTE to unsigned long long.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1419691 ("Unintentional integer overflow")
