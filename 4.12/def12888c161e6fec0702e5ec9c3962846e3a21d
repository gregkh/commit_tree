rtnl: Add support for netdev event to link messages

When netdev events happen, a rtnetlink_event() handler will send
messages for every event in it's white list.  These messages contain
current information about a particular device, but they do not include
the iformation about which event just happened.  The consumer of
the message has to try to infer this information.  In some cases
(ex: NETDEV_NOTIFY_PEERS), that is not possible.

This patch adds a new extension to RTM_NEWLINK message called IFLA_EVENT
that would have an encoding of the which event triggered this
message.  This would allow the the message consumer to easily determine
if it is interested in a particular event or not.
