qed: Revise MFW command locking

Interaction of driver -> management firmware is based
on a one-pending mailbox [per interface], and various
mailbox commands need to be synchronized.

Current scheme is messy, and there's a difficulty extending
it as it deals differently with various commands as well as
making assumption on the required behavior for load/unload
requests.

Drop the current scheme into a completion-list-based approach;
Each flow would try sending the command when possible,
allowing one flow to complete another flow's completion and
relieve the mailbox before sending its own command.
