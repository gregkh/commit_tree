spi: spi-ti-qspi: Use bounce buffer if read buffer is not DMA'ble

Flash filesystems like JFFS2, UBIFS and MTD block layer can provide
vmalloc'd or kmap'd buffers that cannot be mapped using dma_map_sg() and
can potentially be in memory region above 32bit addressable region(ie
buffers belonging to memory region backed by LPAE) of DMA, implement
spi_flash_can_dma() interface to inform SPI core not to map such
buffers.
When buffers are not mapped for DMA, then use a pre allocated bounce
buffer(64K = typical flash erase sector size) to read from flash and
then do a copy to actual destination buffer. This is approach is much
faster than using memcpy using CPU and also reduces CPU load.

With this patch, UBIFS read speed is ~18MB/s and CPU utilization <20% on
DRA74 Rev H EVM. Performance degradation is negligible when compared
with non bounce buffer case while using UBIFS.
