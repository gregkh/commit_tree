pinctrl: meson: use gpio-ranges from DT

When trying to add a gpio-hog, we enter a weird loop where the gpio-ranges
is needed when gpiochip_add_data() is called but in the current implementation
the ranges are added from the driver afterwards.

A simple solution is to rely on the DR gpio-ranges attribute and remove the
call to gpiochip_add_pin_range().
