rcu: Default RCU_FANOUT_LEAF to 16 unless explicitly changed

If the RCU_EXPERT Kconfig option is not set (the default), then the
RCU_FANOUT_LEAF Kconfig option will not be defined, which will cause
the leaf-level rcu_node tree fanout to default to 32 on 32-bit systems
and 64 on 64-bit systems.  This can result in excessive lock contention.
This commit therefore changes the computation of the leaf-level rcu_node
tree fanout so that the result will be 16 unless an explicit Kconfig or
kernel-boot setting says otherwise.
