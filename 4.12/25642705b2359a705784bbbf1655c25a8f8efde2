powerpc/xive: Fix offset for store EOI MMIOs

Architecturally we should apply a 0x400 offset for these. Not doing
it will break future HW implementations.

The offset of 0 is supposed to remain for "triggers" though not all
sources support both trigger and store EOI, and in P9 specifically,
some sources will treat 0 as a store EOI. But future chips will not.
So this makes us use the properly architected offset which should work
always.
