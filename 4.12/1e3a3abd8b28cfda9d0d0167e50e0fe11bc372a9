gtp: make GTP sockets in gtp_newlink optional

Having both GTPv0-U and GTPv1-U is not always desirable.
Fallback from GTPv1-U to GTPv0-U was depreciated from 3GPP
Rel-8 onwards. Post Rel-8 implementation are discuraged
from listening on the v0 port (see 3GPP TS 29.281, Sect. 1).

A future change will completely decouple the sockets from the
network device. Till then, at least one of the sockets needs to
be specified (either v0 or v1), the other is optional.
