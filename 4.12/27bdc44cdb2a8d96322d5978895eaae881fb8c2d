ixgbe: Allow setting zero MAC address for VF

Currently, there is no logic that allows a VF's MAC address to be removed
from the RAR table.

Allow the user to specify a zero MAC address in order to clear the VF's
MAC address from the RAR table.  This functionality is also utilized by
libvirt when removing VFs.
