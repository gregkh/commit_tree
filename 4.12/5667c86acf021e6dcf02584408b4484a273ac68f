mac80211: strictly check mesh address extension mode

Mesh forwarding path checks for address extension mode to fetch
appropriate proxied address and MPP address. Existing condition
that looks for 6 address format is not strict enough so that
frames with improper values are processed and invalid entries
are added into MPP table. Fix that by adding a stricter check before
processing the packet.

Per IEEE Std 802.11s-2011 spec. Table 7-6g1 lists address extension
mode 0x3 as reserved one. And also Table Table 9-13 does not specify
0x3 as valid address field.
