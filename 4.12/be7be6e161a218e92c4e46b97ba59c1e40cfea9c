netfilter: ipvs: fix incorrect conflict resolution

The commit ab8bc7ed864b9c4f1fcb00a22bbe4e0f66ce8003
("netfilter: remove nf_ct_is_untracked")
changed the line
   if (ct && !nf_ct_is_untracked(ct) && nfct_nat(ct)) {
	   to
   if (ct && nfct_nat(ct)) {

meanwhile, the commit 41390895e50bc4f28abe384c6b35ac27464a20ec
("netfilter: ipvs: don't check for presence of nat extension")
from ipvs-next had changed the same line to

  if (ct && !nf_ct_is_untracked(ct) && (ct->status & IPS_NAT_MASK)) {

When ipvs-next got merged into nf-next, the merge resolution took
the first version, dropping the conversion of nfct_nat().

While this doesn't cause a problem at the moment, it will once we stop
adding the nat extension by default.
