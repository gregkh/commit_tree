tools include: Adopt kernel's refcount.h

To aid in catching bugs when using atomics as a reference count.

This is a trimmed down version with just what is used by tools/ at
this point.

After this, the patches submitted by Elena for tools/ doing the
conversion from atomic_ to recount_ methods can be applied and tested.

To activate it, buint perf with:

  make DEBUG=1 -C tools/perf
