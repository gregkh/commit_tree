tracing: Have the trace_array hold the list of registered func probes

Add a link list to the trace_array to hold func probes that are registered.
Currently, all function probes are the same for all instances as it was
before, that is, only the top level trace_array holds the function probes.
But this lays the ground work to have function probes be attached to
individual instances, and having the event trigger only affect events in the
given instance. But that work is still to be done.
