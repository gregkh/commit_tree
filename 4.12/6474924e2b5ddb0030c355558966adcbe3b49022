arch: remove unused macro/function thread_saved_pc()

The only user of thread_saved_pc() in non-arch-specific code was removed
in commit 8243d5597793 ("sched/core: Remove pointless printout in
sched_show_task()").  Remove the implementations as well.

Some architectures use thread_saved_pc() in their arch-specific code.
Leave their thread_saved_pc() intact.
