cpufreq: Add Tegra186 cpufreq driver

Add a new cpufreq driver for Tegra186 (and likely later).
The CPUs are organized into two clusters, Denver and A57,
with two and four cores respectively. CPU frequency can be
adjusted by writing the desired rate divisor and a voltage
hint to a special per-core register.

The frequency of each core can be set individually; however,
this is just a hint as all CPUs in a cluster will run at
the maximum rate of non-idle CPUs in the cluster.
