drm/i915: Amalgamate flushing of display objects

We have three different paths by which userspace wants to flush the
display plane (i.e. objects with obj->pin_display). Use a common helper
to identify those paths and to simplify a later change.

v2: Include the conditional in the name, i915_gem_object_flush_if_display
