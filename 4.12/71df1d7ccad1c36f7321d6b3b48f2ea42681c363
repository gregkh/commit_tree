xen/blkback: don't free be structure too early

The be structure must not be freed when freeing the blkif structure
isn't done. Otherwise a use-after-free of be when unmapping the ring
used for communicating with the frontend will occur in case of a
late call of xenblk_disconnect() (e.g. due to an I/O still active
when trying to disconnect).
