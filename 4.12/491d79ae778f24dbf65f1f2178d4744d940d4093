mm: remove unnecessary back-off function when retrying page reclaim

The backoff mechanism is not needed.  If we have MAX_RECLAIM_RETRIES
loops without progress, we'll OOM anyway; backing off might cut one or
two iterations off that in the rare OOM case.  If we have intermittent
success reclaiming a few pages, the backoff function gets reset also,
and so is of little help in these scenarios.

We might want a backoff function for when there IS progress, but not
enough to be satisfactory.  But this isn't that.  Remove it.
