drm: bridge: dw-hdmi: Create PHY operations

The HDMI TX controller support different PHYs whose programming
interface can vary significantly, especially with vendor PHYs that are
not provided by Synopsys. To support them, create a PHY operation
structure that can be provided by the platform glue layer. The existing
PHY handling code (limited to Synopsys PHY support) is refactored into a
set of default PHY operations that are used automatically when the
platform glue doesn't provide its own operations.
