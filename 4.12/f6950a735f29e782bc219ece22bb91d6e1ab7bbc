checkpatch: improve the SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT test

The current SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT test does not recognize several
defective code style defects where code following a logical test is
inappropriately indented.

Before this patch, for code like:

	if (foo)
	bar();

checkpatch would not emit a warning.

Improve the test to warn when code after a logical test has the same
indentation as the logical test.

Perform the same indentation test for "else" blocks too.
