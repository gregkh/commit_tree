ALSA: hda - Fix applying MSI dual-codec mobo quirk

The previous commit [63691587f7b0: ALSA: hda - Apply dual-codec quirk
for MSI Z270-Gaming mobo] attempted to apply the existing dual-codec
quirk for a MSI mobo.  But it turned out that this isn't applied
properly due to the MSI-vendor quirk before this entry.  I overlooked
such two MSI entries just because they were put in the wrong position,
although we have a list ordered by PCI SSID numbers.

This patch fixes it by rearranging the unordered entries.
