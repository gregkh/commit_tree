ACPICA: Update for automatic repair code for objects returned by evaluate_object

ACPICA commit 6b58810b9aad7358fbf1a0f4057fefa8d29838d3

This change fixes two instances where the repair code made an incorrect
assumption about how reference counts are assigned to package objects.
Resolves issues where a warning was issued about a "large reference
count" -- which usually indicates an attempt to delete an object
that has previously been poisoned and released into the object cache.
