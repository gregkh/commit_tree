ath10k: fix warnings from an earlier commit

I failed to notice that commit 523f6701dbab ("ath10k: update available channel
list for 5G radio") added two new warnings:

drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/mac.c:3129:6: warning: symbol 'ath10k_mac_update_channel_list' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/mac.c:3170: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Fix those.
