net/mlx5: avoid build warning for uniprocessor

Building the driver with CONFIG_SMP disabled results in a harmless
warning:

ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/main.c: In function 'mlx5_irq_set_affinity_hint':
ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/main.c:615:6: error: unused variable 'irq' [-Werror=unused-variable]

It's better to express the conditional compilation using IS_ENABLED()
here, as that lets the compiler see what the intented use for the variable
is, and that it can be silently discarded.
