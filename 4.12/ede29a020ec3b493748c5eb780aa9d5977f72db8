mtd: nand: fsmc: kill {nr_, }partitions structure fields

The ->partitions and ->nr_partitions fields of struct
fsmc_nand_platform_data are never set anywhere, so they are always
NULL/0. The corresponding fields in 'struct fsmc_nand_data' are set to the
value of the same fields in fsmc_nand_platform_data, i.e NULL/0.

Therefore, we remove those two fields, and pass NULL/0 directly to
mtd_device_register(), like many other NAND drivers already do.

At the same time, we remove the comment about the fact that we pass
partition info, since we are no longer doing this.
