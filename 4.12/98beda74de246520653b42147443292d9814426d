powerpc/mm/slice: Fix off-by-1 error when computing slice mask

For low slice, max addr should be less than 4G. Without limiting this correctly
we will end up with a low slice mask which has 17th bit set. This is not
a problem with the current code because our low slice mask is of type u16. But
in later patch I am switching low slice mask to u64 type and having the 17bit
set result in wrong slice mask which in turn results in mmap failures.
