regulator: Add settling time for non-linear voltage transition

Some regulators (some PWM regulators) have the voltage transition
non-linear i.e. exponentially. On such cases, the settling time
for voltage transition can not be presented in the voltage-ramp-delay.

Add new property for non-linear voltage transition and handle this
in getting the voltage settling time.
