fib_rules: Resolve goto rules target on delete

We should avoid marking goto rules unresolved when their
target is actually reachable after rule deletion.

Consolder following sample scenario:

  # ip -4 ru sh
  0:      from all lookup local
  32000:  from all goto 32100
  32100:  from all lookup main
  32100:  from all lookup default
  32766:  from all lookup main
  32767:  from all lookup default

  # ip -4 ru del pref 32100 table main
  # ip -4 ru sh
  0:      from all lookup local
  32000:  from all goto 32100 [unresolved]
  32100:  from all lookup default
  32766:  from all lookup main
  32767:  from all lookup default

After removal of first rule with preference 32100 we
mark all goto rules as unreachable, even when rule with
same preference as removed one still present.

Check if next rule with same preference is available
and make all rules with goto action pointing to it.
