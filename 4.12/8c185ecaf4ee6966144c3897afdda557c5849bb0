drm/i915: Split I915_RESET_IN_PROGRESS into two flags

I915_RESET_IN_PROGRESS is being used for both signaling the requirement
to i915_mutex_lock_interruptible() to avoid taking the struct_mutex and
to instruct a waiter (already holding the struct_mutex) to perform the
reset. To allow for a little more coordination, split these two meaning
into a couple of distinct flags. I915_RESET_BACKOFF tells
i915_mutex_lock_interruptible() not to acquire the mutex and
I915_RESET_HANDOFF tells the waiter to call i915_reset().
