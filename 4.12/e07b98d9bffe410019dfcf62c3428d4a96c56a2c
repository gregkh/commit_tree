bpf: Add strict alignment flag for BPF_PROG_LOAD.

Add a new field, "prog_flags", and an initial flag value
BPF_F_STRICT_ALIGNMENT.

When set, the verifier will enforce strict pointer alignment
regardless of the setting of CONFIG_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS.

The verifier, in this mode, will also use a fixed value of "2" in
place of NET_IP_ALIGN.

This facilitates test cases that will exercise and validate this part
of the verifier even when run on architectures where alignment doesn't
matter.
