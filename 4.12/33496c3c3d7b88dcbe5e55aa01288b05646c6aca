ocfs2: o2hb: revert hb threshold to keep compatible

Configfs is the interface for ocfs2-tools to set configure to kernel and
$configfs_dir/cluster/$clustername/heartbeat/dead_threshold is the one
used to configure heartbeat dead threshold.  Kernel has a default value
of it but user can set O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD in /etc/sysconfig/o2cb
to override it.

Commit 45b997737a80 ("ocfs2/cluster: use per-attribute show and store
methods") changed heartbeat dead threshold name while ocfs2-tools did
not, so ocfs2-tools won't set this configurable and the default value is
always used.  So revert it.
