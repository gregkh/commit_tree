powerpc/iommu: Do not call PageTransHuge() on tail pages

The CMA pages migration code does not support compound pages at
the moment so it performs few tests before proceeding to actual page
migration.

One of the tests - PageTransHuge() - has VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PageTail()) as
it is designed to be called on head pages only. Since we also test for
PageCompound(), and it contains PageTail() and PageHead(), we can
simplify the check by leaving just PageCompound() and therefore avoid
possible VM_BUG_ON_PAGE.
