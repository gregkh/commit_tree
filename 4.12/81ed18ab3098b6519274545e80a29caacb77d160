bpf: add helper inlining infra and optimize map_array lookup

Optimize bpf_call -> bpf_map_lookup_elem() -> array_map_lookup_elem()
into a sequence of bpf instructions.
When JIT is on the sequence of bpf instructions is the sequence
of native cpu instructions with significantly faster performance
than indirect call and two function's prologue/epilogue.
