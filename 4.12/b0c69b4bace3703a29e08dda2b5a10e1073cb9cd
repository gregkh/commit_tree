usb: host: plat: Enable xHCI plat runtime PM

Enable the xHCI plat runtime PM for parent device to suspend/resume
xHCI. Also call pm_runtime_forbid() in probe() function to force users
to explicitly enable runtime pm using power/control in sysfs, in case
some parent devices didn't implement runtime PM callbacks.
