platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: remove pf_device field from struct fujitsu_bl

Both struct fujitsu_bl and struct fujitsu_laptop have a pf_device field.
Up until now the latter has been redundant, which is logically incorrect
because the primary function of the platform device created by
fujitsu-laptop is to provide laptop-related (not brightness-related)
attributes to userspace.

Remove the pf_device field from struct fujitsu_bl and make all module
code use the pf_device field of struct fujitsu_laptop instead.
