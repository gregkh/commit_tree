PM / Domains: Enable users of genpd to specify always on PM domains

The current way to implement an always on PM domain consists of returning
-EBUSY from the ->power_off() callback. This is a bit different compared to
using the always on genpd governor, which prevents the PM domain from being
powered off via runtime suspend, but not via system suspend.

The approach to return -EBUSY from the ->power_off() callback to support
always on PM domains in genpd is suboptimal. That is because it requires
genpd to follow the regular execution path of the power off sequence, which
ends by invoking the ->power_off() callback.

To enable genpd to early abort the power off sequence for always on PM
domains, it needs static information about these configurations. Therefore
let's add a new genpd configuration flag, GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON.

Users of the new GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON flag, are by genpd required to make
sure the PM domain is powered on before calling pm_genpd_init(). Moreover,
users don't need to implement the ->power_off() callback, as genpd doesn't
ever invoke it.
