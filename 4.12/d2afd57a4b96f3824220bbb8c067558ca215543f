tracing/ftrace: Allow instances to have their own function probes

Pass around the local trace_array that is the descriptor for tracing
instances, when enabling and disabling probes. This by default sets the
enable/disable of event probe triggers to work with instances.

The other probes will need some more work to get them working with
instances.
