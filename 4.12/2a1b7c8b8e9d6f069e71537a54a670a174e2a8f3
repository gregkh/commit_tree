IB/rdmavt: Add additional fields to post send trace

This fix is to get additional debugging information.

The following fields are added:
- wqe
- qpt
- num_sge
- ssn
- pid
- send_flags

These additional fields provide for more focused filtering
and triggering.

The patch also moves the trace to just before the wqe is
posted to get the most accurate information and future proofs
the code to trace all possible reserved opcodes.
