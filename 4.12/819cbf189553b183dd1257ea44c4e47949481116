scsi: hisi_sas: workaround SoC about abort timeout bug

This patch adds a workaround solution for a SoC bug which may cause SoC
logic fatal error when disabling a PHY.  Then we find internal abort IO
timeout may occur, and the controller IO breakpoint may be corrupted.

We work around this SoC bug by optimizing the flow of disabling a PHY.
