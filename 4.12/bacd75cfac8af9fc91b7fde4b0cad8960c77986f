i40e/i40evf: Add capability exchange for outer checksum

This patch adds a capability negotiation between VF and PF using ENCAP/
ENCAP_CSUM offload flags in order for the VF to support outer checksum
and TSO offloads for encapsulated packets. These capabilities were assumed
by default and enabled in current hardware. Going forward, these features
needs to be negotiated with PF before advertising to the stack.
Additionally, strip out the mac.type checks for X722 since outer checksums
are enabled based on the ENCAP_CSUM offload negotiation flag and maintain
consistency between drivers in how the features are configured.
