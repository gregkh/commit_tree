sched/core: Idle_task_exit() shouldn't use switch_mm_irqs_off()

idle_task_exit() can be called with IRQs on x86 on and therefore
should use switch_mm(), not switch_mm_irqs_off().

This doesn't seem to cause any problems right now, but it will
confuse my upcoming TLB flush changes.  Nonetheless, I think it
should be backported because it's trivial.  There won't be any
meaningful performance impact because idle_task_exit() is only
used when offlining a CPU.
