rbd: move rbd_unregister_watch() call into rbd_dev_image_release()

rbd_dev->disk tear down vs rbd_watch_cb() race shouldn't be a problem
anymore thanks to EXISTS and REMOVING checks in rbd_dev_update_size().
A similar race could occur on "rbd map", see commit 811c66887746
("rbd: fix rbd map vs notify races").
