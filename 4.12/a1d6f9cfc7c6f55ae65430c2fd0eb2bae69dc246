firmware: google memconsole: Add ARM/ARM64 support

This patch expands the Google firmware memory console driver to also
work on certain tree based platforms running coreboot, such as ARM/ARM64
Chromebooks. This patch now adds another path to find the coreboot table
through the device tree. In order to find that, a second level
bootloader must have installed the 'coreboot' compatible device tree
node that describes its base address and size.

This patch is a rework/split/merge of patches from the chromeos v4.4
kernel tree originally authored by:
