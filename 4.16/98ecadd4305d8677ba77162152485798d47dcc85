hrtimer: Add clock bases and hrtimer mode for softirq context

Currently hrtimer callback functions are always executed in hard interrupt
context. Users of hrtimers, which need their timer function to be executed
in soft interrupt context, make use of tasklets to get the proper context.

Add additional hrtimer clock bases for timers which must expire in softirq
context, so the detour via the tasklet can be avoided. This is also
required for RT, where the majority of hrtimer is moved into softirq
hrtimer context.

The selection of the expiry mode happens via a mode bit. Introduce
HRTIMER_MODE_SOFT and the matching combinations with the ABS/REL/PINNED
bits and update the decoding of hrtimer_mode in tracepoints.
