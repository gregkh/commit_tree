selftests/bpf: add verifier tests for bpf_call

Add extensive set of tests for bpf_call verification logic:

calls: basic sanity
calls: using r0 returned by callee
calls: callee is using r1
calls: callee using args1
calls: callee using wrong args2
calls: callee using two args
calls: callee changing pkt pointers
calls: two calls with args
calls: two calls with bad jump
calls: recursive call. test1
calls: recursive call. test2
calls: unreachable code
calls: invalid call
calls: jumping across function bodies. test1
calls: jumping across function bodies. test2
calls: call without exit
calls: call into middle of ld_imm64
calls: call into middle of other call
calls: two calls with bad fallthrough
calls: two calls with stack read
calls: two calls with stack write
calls: spill into caller stack frame
calls: two calls with stack write and void return
calls: ambiguous return value
calls: two calls that return map_value
calls: two calls that return map_value with bool condition
calls: two calls that return map_value with incorrect bool check
calls: two calls that receive map_value via arg=ptr_stack_of_caller. test1
calls: two calls that receive map_value via arg=ptr_stack_of_caller. test2
calls: two jumps that receive map_value via arg=ptr_stack_of_jumper. test3
calls: two calls that receive map_value_ptr_or_null via arg. test1
calls: two calls that receive map_value_ptr_or_null via arg. test2
calls: pkt_ptr spill into caller stack
