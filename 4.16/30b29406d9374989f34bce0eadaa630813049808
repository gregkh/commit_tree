drm/i915: Restore the wait for idle engine after flushing interrupts

So it appears that commit 5427f207852d ("drm/i915: Bump wait-times for
the final CS interrupt before parking") was a little over optimistic in
its belief that it had successfully waited for all residual activity on
the engines before parking. Numerous sightings in CI since then of

on Braswell, which indicates that the engine just needs that little bit
longer after flushing the tasklet to settle. So give it a few more
milliseconds before declaring an err and applying the emergency brake.
