batman-adv: invalidate checksum on fragment reassembly

A more sophisticated implementation could try to combine fragment checksums
when all fragments have CHECKSUM_COMPLETE and are split at even offsets.
For now, we just set ip_summed to CHECKSUM_NONE to avoid "hw csum failure"
warnings in the kernel log when fragmented frames are received. In
consequence, skb_pull_rcsum() can be replaced with skb_pull().

Note that in usual setups, packets don't reach batman-adv with
CHECKSUM_COMPLETE (I assume NICs bail out of checksumming when they see
batadv's ethtype?), which is why the log messages do not occur on every
system using batman-adv. I could reproduce this issue by stacking
batman-adv on top of a VXLAN interface.
