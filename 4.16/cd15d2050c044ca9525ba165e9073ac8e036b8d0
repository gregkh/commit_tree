KVM: arm/arm64: Fixup userspace irqchip static key optimization

When I introduced a static key to avoid work in the critical path for
userspace irqchips which is very rarely used, I accidentally messed up
my logic and used && where I should have used ||, because the point was
to short-circuit the evaluation in case userspace irqchips weren't even
in use.

This fixes an issue when running in-kernel irqchip VMs alongside
userspace irqchip VMs.
