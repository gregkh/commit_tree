platform/x86: surfacepro3: Support for wakeup from suspend-to-idle

Modify surface_button_notify() to make it wake up the system from
suspend-to-idle (by reporting "hard" wakeup events while suspended)
and add wakeup initialization to surface_button_add() for wakeup
events reported by this driver to work at all.
