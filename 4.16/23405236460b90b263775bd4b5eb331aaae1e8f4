mt76: fix transmission of encrypted management frames

Hardware encryption seems to break encrypted unicast mgmt tx.
Unfortunately the hardware TXWI header does not have a bit to indicate
that a frame is software encrypted, so sw-encrypted frames need to use a
different WCID. For that to work, the CCMP PN needs to be generated in
software, which makes things a bit slower, so only do it for keys that
also need to tx management frames.
