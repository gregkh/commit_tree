nfs: Use proper enum definitions for nfs_show_stable

Commit 8224b2734ab1 ("NFS: Add static NFS I/O tracepoints") had a
hack to work around some odd behavior observed with
__print_symbolic. I couldn't ever get it to display NFS_FILE_SYNC
when using TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM macros to set up the enum values.

I tracked down the actual bug that forced me to add the workaround.
That issue will be addressed soon, so replace the hack with a proper
implementation.
