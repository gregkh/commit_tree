ALSA: ice1724: Fix resume issues with Prodigy 7.1 HiFi

There are two issues after resuming from suspend on the
Audiotrak Prodigy 7.1 HiFi:
 - the output volume is set to 100%
 - microphone input isn't working anymore

This patch fixes these issues by reinitializing both codecs of the device
and restoring the previous volumes during resume.
