ACPICA: Fix an off-by-one error in acpi_get_timer_duration().

ACPICA commit b4fd33f3c2af014aeec978d46392d286fd7f52b3

Delta calculation has an off-by-one error when there is a rollover.
For example, when start_ticks is 0x00FFFFFF and end_ticks is 0x00000000
(for 24-bit timer), delta_ticks should be 1 (one) but it was 0 (zero).
