signal/ia64: Move the ia64 specific si_codes to asm-generic/siginfo.h

Having si_codes in many different files simply encourages duplicate
definitions that can cause problems later.  To avoid that merge the
ia64 specific si_codes into uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h

Update the sanity checks in arch/x86/kernel/signal_compat.c to expect
the now lager NSIGILL and NSIGFPE.  As nothing excpe the larger count
is exposed on x86 no additional code needs to be updated.
