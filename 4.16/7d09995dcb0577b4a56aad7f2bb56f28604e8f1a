serdev: Fix serdev_uevent failure on ACPI enumerated serdev-controllers

ACPI enumerated serdev-controllers do not have an ACPI companion, the ACPI
companion belongs to the serdev-device child of the serdev-controller, not
to the controller itself. This was causing serdev_uevent to always return
-ENODEV when called on a serdev-controller leading to errors like these:

kernel: serial serial0: uevent: failed to send synthetic uevent

being logged. This commit modifies serdev_uevent to directly return 0
when called on an ACPI enumerated serdev-controller fixing this.

Note: I do not think that setting a modalias on a devicetree enumerated
serdev-controller makes sense either. So perhaps the !dev->of_node part of
the check can be dropped too, but I'm not entirely sure that doing this
on devicetree too is correct.
