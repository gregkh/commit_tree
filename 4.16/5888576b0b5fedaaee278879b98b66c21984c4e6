drm/i915: fix register naming

This name was added with the whitelisting of registers for building up OA
configs. It is contained in a range gen8 whitelist :

   addr >= RPM_CONFIG0.reg && addr <= NOA_CONFIG(8).reg

Hence why the name isn't used anywhere.

v2: Fix register name again RPC->RCP (Matthew)
