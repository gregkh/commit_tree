i2c: Switch to using gpiod interface for gpio bus recovery

Currently the i2c gpio recovery code uses gpio integer interface
instead of the gpiod. This change switch the core code to use
the gpiod while still retaining compatibility with the gpio integer
interface. This will allow individual driver to be updated and tested
individual to switch to using the gpiod interface.
