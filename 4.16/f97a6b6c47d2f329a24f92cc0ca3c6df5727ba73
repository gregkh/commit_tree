s390/cio: fix ccw_device_start_timeout API

There are cases a device driver can't start IO because the device is
currently in use by cio. In this case the device driver is notified
when the device is usable again.

Using ccw_device_start_timeout we would set the timeout (and change
an existing timeout) before we test for internal usage. Worst case
this could lead to an unexpected timer deletion.

Fix this by setting the timeout after we test for internal usage.
