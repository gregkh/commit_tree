i40e/i40evf: Detect and recover hung queue scenario

In VFs, there is a known issue which can cause writebacks
to not occur when interrupts are disabled and there are
less than 4 descriptors resulting in TX timeout. Timeout
can also occur due to lost interrupt.

The current implementation for detecting and recovering
from hung queues in the PF is problematic because it actually
actively encourages lost interrupts.  By triggering a SW
interrupt, interrupts are forced on.  If we are already in
napi_poll and an interrupt fires, napi_poll will not be
rescheduled and the interrupt is effectively lost; thereby
potentially *causing* hung queues.

This patch checks whether packets are being processed between
every watchdog cycle and determine potential hung queue and
fires triggers SW interrupt only for that particular queue.
