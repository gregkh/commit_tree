iio: add field identifier for @use_count kernel-doc

Kernel-doc for @use_count does not currently have a field identifier.
All the rest of the fields do. @use_count is used internally and should
not be accessed directly by the driver so it should be marked as so.

Add [INTERN] identifier to @use_count field.
