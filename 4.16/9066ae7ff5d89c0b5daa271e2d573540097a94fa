ALSA: pcm: Use dma_bytes as size parameter in dma_mmap_coherent()

When trying to use the driver (e.g. aplay *.wav), the 4MiB DMA buffer
will get mmapp'ed in 16KiB chunks. But this fails with the 2nd 16KiB
area, as the page offset is outside of the VMA range (size), which is
currently used as size parameter in snd_pcm_lib_default_mmap(). By
using the DMA buffer size (dma_bytes) instead, the complete DMA buffer
can be mmapp'ed and the issue is fixed.

This issue was detected on an ARM platform (TI AM57xx) using the RME
HDSP MADI PCIe soundcard.
