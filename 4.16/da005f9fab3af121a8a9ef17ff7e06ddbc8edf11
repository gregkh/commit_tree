IB/mlx5: remove redundant assignment of mdev

The initial assignment to mdev is redundant as mdev is re-assigned
later and the first assigned value is never read. Remove this
redundant assignment.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/main.c:359:24: warning: Value stored
to 'mdev' during its initialization is never read
