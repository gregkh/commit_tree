s390: do not bypass BPENTER for interrupt system calls

The system call path can be interrupted before the switch back to the
standard branch prediction with BPENTER has been done. The critical
section cleanup code skips forward to .Lsysc_do_svc and bypasses the
BPENTER. In this case the kernel and all subsequent code will run with
the limited branch prediction.
