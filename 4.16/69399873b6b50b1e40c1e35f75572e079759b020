i40e: Fix kdump failure

kdump fails in the system when used in conjunction with Ethernet driver
X722/X710. This is mainly because when we are resource constrained i.e.
when we have just one online_cpus, we are enabling VMDq and iWARP. It
doesn't make sense to enable them with just one CPU and starve kdump
for lack of IRQs.

So don't enable VMDq or iWARP when we just have a single CPU.
