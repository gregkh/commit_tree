staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Don't enable FAS on Tx

For Tx confirmed frames that have an error indication in the frame
descriptor, we look at the Frame Annotation Status field (in the
buffer headroom) for details on the root cause and then print
a debug message with that information.

While useful in initial development stages, it doesn't bring
enough added value to justify reserving 64B of headroom for all
Tx frames (FAS is only 8B long, but we must reserve chunks of 64B
from the hardware annotation area).

If we remove the need for FAS field from egress frames, we can
renounce hardware annotation completely, since FAS is the only
HWA field we currently use.
