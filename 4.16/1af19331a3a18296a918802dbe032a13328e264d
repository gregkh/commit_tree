powerpc/64s: Relax PACA address limitations

Book3S PACA memory allocation is restricted by the RMA limit and also
must not take SLB faults when accessed in virtual mode. Currently a
fixed 256MB limit is used for this, which is imprecise and sub-optimal.

Update the paca allocation limits to use use the ppc64_rma_size for RMA
limit, and share the safe_stack_limit() that is currently used for stack
allocations that must not take virtual mode faults.

The safe_stack_limit() name is changed to ppc64_bolted_size() to match
ppc64_rma_size and some comments are updated. We also need to use
early_mmu_has_feature() because we are now calling this function prior
to the jump label patching that enables mmu_has_feature().
