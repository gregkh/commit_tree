tee: shm: don't put_page on null shm->pages

In the case that shm->pages fails to allocate, the current exit
error path will try to put_page on a null shm->pages and cause
a null pointer dereference when accessing shm->pages[n]. Fix this
by only performing the put_page and kfree on shm->pages if it
is not null.
