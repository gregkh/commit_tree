drm/i915: Kick the rps worker when changing the boost frequency

The boost frequency is only applied from the RPS worker while someone is
waiting on a request and requested a boost. As such, when the user
wishes to change the frequency, we have to kick the worker in order to
re-evaluate whether to apply the boost frequency.

v2: Check num_waiters to decide if we should kick the worker to handle
boosting.
