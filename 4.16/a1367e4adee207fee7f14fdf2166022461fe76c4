scsi: aacraid: Reschedule host scan in case of failure

If the driver fails to retrieve information from the fw (could happen when
the fw is not fully in its senses), the driver does nothing and change is
not processed correctly by the driver

Schedule host rescan in case of failure. This is only for SAFW, since
the information retrieval failure will happen on SAFW devices.
