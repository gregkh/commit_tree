IB/hfi1: Remove unnecessary fecn and becn fields

packet->fecn and packet->becn are calculated in the hot path
and are never used. Remove these fields as they show to be
costly in a profile. Also, remove initialization for
becn and fecn in process_ecn() as they're unconditionally
assigned in the function and ensure fecn and becn variables
use a boolean type.
