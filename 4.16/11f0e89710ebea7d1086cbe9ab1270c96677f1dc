IB/{hfi1, qib}: Fix a concurrency issue with device name in logging

The get_unit_name() function crafts a string based on the device name
and the device unit number.  It then stores this in a static variable.

This has concurrency issues as can be seen with this log:

hfi1 0000:02:00.0: hfi1_1: read_idle_message: read idle message 0x203
hfi1 0000:01:00.0: hfi1_1: read_idle_message: read idle message 0x203

The PCI device ID (0000:02:00.0 vs. 0000:01:00.0) is correct for the
message, but the device string hfi1_1 is incorrect (it should be
hfi1_0 for the second log message).

Remove get_unit_name() function.

Instead, use the rvt accessor rvt_get_ibdev_name() to get the IB name
string.

Clean up any hfi1_early_xx calls that can now use the new path.

QIB has the same (qib_get_unit_name()) issue.  Updating as necessary.

Remove qib_get_unit_name() function.

Update log message that has redundant device name.
