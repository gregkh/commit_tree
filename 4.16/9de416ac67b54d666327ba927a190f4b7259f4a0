scsi: lpfc: Fix SCSI LUN discovery when SCSI and NVME enabled

When enabled for both SCSI and NVME support, and connected pt2pt to a
SCSI only target, the driver nodelist entry for the remote port is left
in PRLI_ISSUE state and no SCSI LUNs are discovered. Works fine if only
configured for SCSI support.

Error was due to some of the prli points still reflecting the need to
send only 1 PRLI. On a lot of fabric configs, targets were NVME only,
which meant the fabric-reported protocol attributes were only telling
the driver one protocol or the other. Thus things worked fine. With
pt2pt, the driver must send a PRLI for both protocols as there are no
hints on what the target supports. Thus pt2pt targets were hitting the
multiple PRLI issues.

Complete the dual PRLI support. Track explicitly whether scsi (fcp) or
nvme prli's have been sent. Accurately track protocol support detected
on each node as reported by the fabric or probed by PRLI traffic.
