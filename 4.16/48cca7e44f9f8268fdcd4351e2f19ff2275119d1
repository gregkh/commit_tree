libbpf: add support for bpf_call

- recognize relocation emitted by llvm
- since all regular function will be kept in .text section and llvm
  takes care of pc-relative offsets in bpf_call instruction
  simply copy all of .text to relevant program section while adjusting
  bpf_call instructions in program section to point to newly copied
  body of instructions from .text
- do so for all programs in the elf file
- set all programs types to the one passed to bpf_prog_load()

Note for elf files with multiple programs that use different
functions in .text section we need to do 'linker' style logic.
This work is still TBD
