PCI: tegra: Refactor configuration space mapping code

Use only 4 KiB space from the available 1 GiB PCIe aperture to access
endpoint configuration space by dynamically moving the AFI_FPCI_BAR base
address. This frees more space for mapping endpoint device BARs on some
Tegra platforms.

The ->add_bus() and ->remove_bus() callbacks are now no longer needed,
so they can be removed.
