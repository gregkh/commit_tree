clk: divider: fix incorrect usage of container_of

divider_recalc_rate() is an helper function used by clock divider of
different types, so the structure containing the 'hw' pointer is not
always a 'struct clk_divider'

At the following line:
> div = _get_div(table, val, flags, divider->width);

in several cases, the value of 'divider->width' is garbage as the actual
structure behind this memory is not a 'struct clk_divider'

Fortunately, this width value is used by _get_val() only when
CLK_DIVIDER_MAX_AT_ZERO flag is set. This has never been the case so
far when the structure is not a 'struct clk_divider'. This is probably
why we did not notice this bug before
