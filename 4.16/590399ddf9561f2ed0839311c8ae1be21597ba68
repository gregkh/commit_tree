gianfar: Fix Rx byte accounting for ndev stats

Don't include in the Rx bytecount of the packet sent up the stack:
the FCB (frame control block), and the padding bytes inserted by
the controller into the frame payload, nor the FCS. All these are
being pulled out of the skb by gfar_process_frame().
This issue is old, likely from the driver's beginnings, however
it was amplified by recent:
commit d903ec77118c ("gianfar: simplify FCS handling and fix memory leak")
which basically added the FCS to the Rx bytecount, and so brought
this to my attention.
