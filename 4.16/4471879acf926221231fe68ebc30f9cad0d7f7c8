hwmon: (pmbus) cffps: Add PMBUS_SKIP_STATUS_CHECK

This power supply device regularly fails to read VOUT_MODE due to the
CML bit going high. This results in an incorrect exponent used for the
voltage data, and therefore the power supply reports incorrect voltage.
Work around this by setting the pmbus flag to skip the CML check.
