bpf: fix bpf_prog_array_copy_to_user warning from perf event prog query

syzkaller tried to perform a prog query in perf_event_query_prog_array()
where struct perf_event_query_bpf had an ids_len of 1,073,741,353 and
thus causing a warning due to failed kcalloc() allocation out of the
bpf_prog_array_copy_to_user() helper. Given we cannot attach more than
64 programs to a perf event, there's no point in allowing huge ids_len.
Therefore, allow a buffer that would fix the maximum number of ids and
also add a __GFP_NOWARN to the temporary ids buffer.

Fixes: f371b304f12e ("bpf/tracing: allow user space to query prog array on the same tp")
Fixes: 0911287ce32b ("bpf: fix bpf_prog_array_copy_to_user() issues")
