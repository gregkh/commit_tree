net/smc: handle device, port, and QP error events

RoCE device changes cause an IB event, processed in the global event
handler for the ROCE device. Problems for a certain Queue Pair cause a QP
event, processed in the QP event handler for this QP.
Among those events are port errors and other fatal device errors. All
link groups using such a port or device must be terminated in those cases.
