PCI/DPC: Read RP PIO Log Size once at probe

The RP PIO Log Size is a read-only field in the DPC Capability, so it is
constant and known at probe-time, but previously we read it every time we
processed an RP PIO error.

Read it once in dpc_probe() (if the RP Extensions for DPC are supported)
and remember the size in struct dpc_dev.  No functional change intended.
