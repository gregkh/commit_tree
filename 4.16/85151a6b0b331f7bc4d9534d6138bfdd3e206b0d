clk: iproc: Fix error in the pll post divider rate calculation

The pll post divider code was using DIV_ROUND_UP when determining the
divider value best suited to produce the target frequency.
Using DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST will give us better divider values when
the division results in a small remainder.
Also, change the post divider clock over to the determine_rate api
instead of round_rate.
