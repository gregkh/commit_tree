tun: avoid unnecessary READ_ONCE in tun_net_xmit

The statement no longer serves a purpose.

Commit fa35864e0bb7 ("tuntap: Fix for a race in accessing numqueues")
added the ACCESS_ONCE to avoid a race condition with skb_queue_len.

Commit 436accebb530 ("tuntap: remove unnecessary sk_receive_queue
length check during xmit") removed the affected skb_queue_len check.

Commit 96f84061620c ("tun: add eBPF based queue selection method")
split the function, reading the field a second time in the callee.
The temp variable is now only read once, so just remove it.
