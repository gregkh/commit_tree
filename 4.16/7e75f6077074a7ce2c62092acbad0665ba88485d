scsi: bfa: use ktime_get_real_ts64 for firmware timestamp

BFA_TRC_TS() calculates a 32-bit microsecond timestamp using the
deprecated do_gettimeofday() function. This overflows roughly every 71
minutes, so it's obviously not used as an absolute time stamp, but it
seems wrong to use a time base for it that will jump during
settimeofday() calls, leap seconds, or the y2038 overflow.

This converts it to ktime_get_ts64(), which has none of those problems
but is not synchronized to wall-clock time.
