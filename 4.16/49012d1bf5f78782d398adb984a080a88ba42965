clk: bcm2835: Fix ana->maskX definitions

ana->maskX values are already '~'-ed in bcm2835_pll_set_rate(). Remove
the '~' in the definition to fix ANA setup.

Note that this commit fixes a long standing bug preventing one from
using an HDMI display if it's plugged after the FW has booted Linux.
This is because PLLH is used by the HDMI encoder to generate the pixel
clock.
