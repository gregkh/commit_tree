kernfs: fix regression in kernfs_fop_write caused by wrong type

Commit b7ce40cff0b9 ("kernfs: cache atomic_write_len in
kernfs_open_file") changes type of local variable 'len' from ssize_t
to size_t. This change caused that the *ppos value is updated also
when the previous write callback failed.

Mentioned snippet:
...
len = ops->write(...); <- return value can be negative
...
if (len > 0)           <- true here in this case
        *ppos += len;
...
