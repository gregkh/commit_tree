spi: a3700: Remove endianness swapping for full-duplex transfers

Fixes the following sparse warnings :
line 767: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
line 767:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [assigned] [usertype] val_out
line 767:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>
line 776: warning: cast to restricted __le32

This takes advantage of readl/writel to do the endianness reordering,
and removes an extra variable in the function.
