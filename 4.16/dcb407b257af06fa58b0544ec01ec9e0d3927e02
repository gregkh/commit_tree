ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: Handle inverted BCLK in non-DSP modes

Currently BCLK inverting is only handled when the DAI format is
DSP, but the BCLK may be inverted in any supported mode. Without
this using this CODEC in any other mode than DSP with the BCLK
inverted leads to bad sampling timing and very poor audio quality.
