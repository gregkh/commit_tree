sctp: update mid instead of ssn when doing stream and asoc reset

When using idata and doing stream and asoc reset, setting ssn with
0 could only clear the 1st 16 bits of mid.

So to make this work for both data and idata, it sets mid with 0
instead of ssn, and also mid_uo for unordered idata also need to
be cleared, as said in section 2.3.2 of RFC8260.
