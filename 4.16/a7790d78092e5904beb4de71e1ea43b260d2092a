drm/etnaviv: move workqueue to be per GPU

While the etnaviv workqueue needs to be ordered, as we rely on work items
being executed in queuing order, this is only true for a single GPU.
Having a shared workqueue for all GPUs in the system limits concurrency
artificially.

Getting each GPU its own ordered workqueue still meets our ordering
expectations and enables retire workers to run concurrently.
