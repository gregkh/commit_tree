dmaengine: xilinx_dma: properly configure the SG mode bit in the driver for cdma

If the hardware is configured for Scatter Gather(SG) mode,
and hardware is idle, in the control register SG mode bit
must be set to a 0 then back to 1 by the software, to force
the CDMA SG engine to use a new value written to the CURDESC_PNTR
register, failure to do so could result errors from the dmaengine.

This patch updates the same.
