ACPI / scan: Use acpi_bus_get_status() to initialize ACPI_TYPE_DEVICE devs

The acpi_get_bus_status wrapper for acpi_bus_get_status_handle has some
code to handle certain device quirks, in some cases we also need this
quirk handling for the initial _STA call.

Specifically on some devices calling _STA before all _DEP dependencies
are met results in errors like these:

[    0.123579] ACPI Error: No handler for Region [ECRM] (00000000ba9edc4c)
               [GenericSerialBus] (20170831/evregion-166)
[    0.123601] ACPI Error: Region GenericSerialBus (ID=9) has no handler
               (20170831/exfldio-299)
[    0.123618] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed
               \_SB.I2C1.BAT1._STA, AE_NOT_EXIST (20170831/psparse-550)

acpi_get_bus_status already has code to avoid this, so by using it we
also silence these errors from the initial _STA call.

Note that in order for the acpi_get_bus_status handling for this to work,
we initialize dep_unmet to 1 until acpi_device_dep_initialize gets called,
this means that battery devices will be instantiated with an initial
status of 0. This is not a problem, acpi_bus_attach will get called soon
after the instantiation anyways and it will update the status as first
point of order.
