perf vendor events aarch64: Add JSON metrics for ARM Cortex-A53 Processor

Add JSON metrics for ARM Cortex-A53 Processor.

Unlike the Intel processors there isn't a script that automatically
generated these files. The patch was manually generated from the
documentation and the previous oprofile ARM Cortex ac53 event file patch
I made.

The relevant documentation is in the "12.9 Events" section of the ARM
Cortex A53 MPCore Processor Revision: r0p4 Technical Reference Manual.

The ARM Cortex A53 manual is available at:

  http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0500g/DDI0500G_cortex_a53_trm.pdf

Use that to look for additional information about the events.
