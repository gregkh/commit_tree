Input: remove unneeded DRIVER_LICENSE #defines

There is no need to #define the license of the driver, just put it in
the MODULE_LICENSE() line directly as a text string.

This allows tools that check that the module license matches the source
code license to work properly, as there is no need to unwind the
unneeded dereference.  For some of these drivers, the #define is just a
few lines above the MODULE_LICENSE() line, which is extra pointless.
