dm raid: fix raid set size revalidation

The raid set size is being revalidated unconditionally before a
reshaping conversion is started.  MD requires the size to only be
reduced in case of a stripe removing (i.e. shrinking) reshape but not
when growing because the raid array has to stay small until after the
growing reshape finishes.

Fix by avoiding the size revalidation in preresume unless a shrinking
reshape is requested.
