crypto: caam - fix endless loop when DECO acquire fails

In case DECO0 cannot be acquired - i.e. run_descriptor_deco0() fails
with -ENODEV, caam_probe() enters an endless loop:

run_descriptor_deco0
	ret -ENODEV
	-> instantiate_rng
		-ENODEV, overwritten by -EAGAIN
		ret -EAGAIN
		-> caam_probe
			-EAGAIN results in endless loop

It turns out the error path in instantiate_rng() is incorrect,
the checks are done in the wrong order.
