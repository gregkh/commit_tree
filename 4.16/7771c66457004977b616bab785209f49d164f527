signal/arm: Document conflicts with SI_USER and SIGFPE

Setting si_code to 0 results in a userspace seeing an si_code of 0.
This is the same si_code as SI_USER.  Posix and common sense requires
that SI_USER not be a signal specific si_code.  As such this use of 0
for the si_code is a pretty horribly broken ABI.

Further use of si_code == 0 guaranteed that copy_siginfo_to_user saw a
value of __SI_KILL and now sees a value of SIL_KILL with the result
that uid and pid fields are copied and which might copying the si_addr
field by accident but certainly not by design.  Making this a very
flakey implementation.

Utilizing FPE_FIXME, siginfo_layout will now return SIL_FAULT and the
appropriate fields will be reliably copied.

Possible ABI fixes includee:
- Send the signal without siginfo
- Don't generate a signal
- Possibly assign and use an appropriate si_code
- Don't handle cases which can't happen
