pipe, sysctl: drop 'min' parameter from pipe-max-size converter

Patch series "pipe: buffer limits fixes and cleanups", v2.

This series simplifies the sysctl handler for pipe-max-size and fixes
another set of bugs related to the pipe buffer limits:

- The root user wasn't allowed to exceed the limits when creating new
  pipes.

- There was an off-by-one error when checking the limits, so a limit of
  N was actually treated as N - 1.

- F_SETPIPE_SZ accepted values over UINT_MAX.

- Reading the pipe buffer limits could be racy.

This patch (of 7):

Before validating the given value against pipe_min_size,
do_proc_dopipe_max_size_conv() calls round_pipe_size(), which rounds the
value up to pipe_min_size.  Therefore, the second check against
pipe_min_size is redundant.  Remove it.
