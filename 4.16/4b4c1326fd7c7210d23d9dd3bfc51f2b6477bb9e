xfs: treat CoW fork operations as delalloc for quota accounting

Since the CoW fork only exists in memory, it is incorrect to update the
on-disk quota block counts when we modify the CoW fork.  Unlike the data
fork, even real extents in the CoW fork are only delalloc-style
reservations (on-disk they're owned by the refcountbt) so they must not
be tracked in the on disk quota info.  Ensure the i_delayed_blks
accounting reflects this too.
