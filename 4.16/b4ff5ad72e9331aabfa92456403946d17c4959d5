Btrfs: use struct completion in scrub_submit_raid56_bio_wait

This changes to use struct completion directly and removes 'struct
scrub_bio_ret' along with the code using it.

This struct is used to get the return value from bio, but the caller can
access bio to get the return value directly and is holding a reference
on it so it won't go away underneath us and can be removed safely.
