ALSA: hda - Reduce the suspend time consumption for ALC256

ALC256 has its own quirk to override the shutup call, and it contains
the COEF update for pulling down the headset jack control.  Currently,
the COEF update is called after clearing the headphone pin, and this
seems triggering a stall of the codec communication, and results in a
long delay over a second at suspend.

A quick resolution is to swap the calls: at first with the COEF
update, then clear the headphone pin.
