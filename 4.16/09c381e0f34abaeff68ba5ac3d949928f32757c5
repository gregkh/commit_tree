drm/amdgpu: Unify the dm resume calls into one

amdgpu_dm_display_resume is now called from dm_resume to
unify DAL resume call into a single function call

There is no more need to separately call 2 resume functions
for DM.

Initially they were separated to resume display state after
cursor is pinned. But because there is no longer any corruption
with the cursor - the calls can be merged into one function hook.
