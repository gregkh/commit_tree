tcp: place all zerocopy payload in frags

This avoids an unnecessary copy of 1-2KB and improves tso_fragment,
which has to fall back to tcp_fragment if skb->len != skb_data_len.

It also avoids a surprising inconsistency in notifications:
Zerocopy packets sent over loopback have their frags copied, so set
SO_EE_CODE_ZEROCOPY_COPIED in the notification. But this currently
does not happen for small packets, because when all data fits in the
linear fragment, data is not copied in skb_orphan_frags_rx.
