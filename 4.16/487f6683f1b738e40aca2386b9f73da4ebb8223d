IB/mthca: Fix gup usage in mthca_map_user_db()

get_user_pages() must be called with mmap_sem held, currently
it is not. In fact it is called under the user db_table->mutex.
To fix this we can convert gup to use the fast alternative,
and safely avoid taking mmap_sem, if possible. Furthermore
this is safe wrt to the mutex as other callers that take the
lock (unmap and alloc_db) are not called under mmap_sem
(hence possible deadlock).
