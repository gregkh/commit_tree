posix-timers: Protect posix clock array access against speculation

The clockid argument of clockid_to_kclock() comes straight from user space
via various syscalls and is used as index into the posix_clocks array.

Protect it against spectre v1 array out of bounds speculation. Remove the
redundant check for !posix_clock[id] as this is another source for
speculation and does not provide any advantage over the return
posix_clock[id] path which returns NULL in that case anyway.
