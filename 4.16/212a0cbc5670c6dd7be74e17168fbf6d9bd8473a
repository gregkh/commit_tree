Revert "RDMA/mlx5: Fix integer overflow while resizing CQ"

The original commit of this patch has a munged log message that is
missing several of the tags the original author intended to be on the
patch.  This was due to patchworks misinterpreting a cut-n-paste
separator line as an end of message line and munging the mbox that was
used to import the patch:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10264089/

The original patch will be reapplied with a fixed commit message so the
proper tags are applied.

This reverts commit aa0de36a40f446f5a21a7c1e677b98206e242edb.
