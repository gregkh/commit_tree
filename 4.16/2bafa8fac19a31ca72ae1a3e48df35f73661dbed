ixgbe: don't set RXDCTL.RLPML for 82599

commit 2de6aa3a666e ("ixgbe: Add support for padding packet")

Uses RXDCTL.RLPML to limit the maximum frame size on Rx when using
build_skb. Unfortunately that register does not work on 82599.

Added an explicit check to avoid setting this register on 82599 MAC.

Extended the comment related to the setting of RXDCTL.RLPML to better
explain its purpose.
