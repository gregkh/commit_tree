act_mirred: get rid of tcfm_ifindex from struct tcf_mirred

tcfm_dev always points to the correct netdev and we already
hold a refcnt, so no need to use tcfm_ifindex to lookup again.

If we would support moving target netdev across netns, using
pointer would be better than ifindex.

This also fixes dumping obsolete ifindex, now after the
target device is gone we just dump 0 as ifindex.
