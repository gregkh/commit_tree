spi: a3700: Set frequency limits at startup

Armada 3700 SPI controller has an internal clock divider which can
divide the parent clock frequency by up to 30.

This patch sets the limits in the spi_controller fields so that we can
detect when a non-supported frequency is requested by a device for a
transfer.
