x86/mm/pkeys: Fix fill_sig_info_pkey

SEGV_PKUERR is a signal specific si_code which happens to have the
same numeric value as several others: BUS_MCEERR_AR, ILL_ILLTRP,
FPE_FLTOVF, TRAP_HWBKPT, CLD_TRAPPED, POLL_ERR, SEGV_THREAD_ID,
as such it is not safe to just test the si_code the signal number
must also be tested to prevent a false positive in fill_sig_info_pkey.

I found this error by inspection, and BUS_MCEERR_AR appears to
be a real candidate for confusion.  So pass in si_signo and fix it.
