MAINTAINERS: Move all MTD related branches to a single repo

Historically, branches targeting the next release (and pulled in
linux-next) have been pushed on the l2-mtd repo and fixes branches on
the linux-mtd one. Now that all MTD maintainers have RW permissions on
linux-mtd tree, there's no good reason to have two different trees.
Move all -next branches to linux-mtd.
