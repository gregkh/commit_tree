drm/amd/display: Implement work around for optc underflow.

Work around for a hw bug causing optc underflow if blank data
double buffer disable and remove mpcc.
Checking optc status after otg unlock, after wait mpcc idle
check status again, if optc underflow just happens after wait
mpcc idle, clear underflow status and enable blank data double
buffer.
