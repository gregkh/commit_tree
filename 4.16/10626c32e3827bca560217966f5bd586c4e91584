riscv/ftrace: Add basic support

This patch contains basic ftrace support for RV64I platform.
Specifically, function tracer (HAVE_FUNCTION_TRACER), function graph
tracer (HAVE_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER), and a frame pointer test
(HAVE_FUNCTION_GRAPH_FP_TEST) are implemented following the
instructions in Documentation/trace/ftrace-design.txt.

Note that the functions in both ftrace.c and setup.c should not be
hooked with the compiler's -pg option: to prevent infinite self-
referencing for the former, and to ignore early setup stuff for the
latter.
