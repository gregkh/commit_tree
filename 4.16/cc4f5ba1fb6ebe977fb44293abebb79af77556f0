lightnvm: pblk: ensure kthread alloc. before kicking it

When creating the write thread, ensure that the kthread has been created
before initializing the timer responsible from kicking it. Otherwise, if
the kthread creation fails or gets killed from used space, we risk
kicking an empty thread structure.

Also, since the kthread creation can be interrupted form user space,
adapt the error path to not report an error when this happens, since it
is intentional that the instance creation is aborted.
