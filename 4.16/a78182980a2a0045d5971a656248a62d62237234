soc: brcmstb: biuctrl: exit without warning on non brcmstb platforms

Currently if this driver is included, we get the following warning
on any platforms irrespective of whether it's brcmstb platform or not.
"
 brcmstb: biuctrl: missing BIU control node
 brcmstb: biuctrl: MCP: Unable to disable write pairing!
"

This patch allows to exit early without any warning messages on non
brcmstb platforms as it's meaningless for them.
