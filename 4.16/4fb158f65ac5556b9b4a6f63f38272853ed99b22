powerpc: track allocation status of all pkeys

Total 32 keys are available on power7 and above. However
pkey 0,1 are reserved. So effectively we  have  30 pkeys.

On 4K kernels, we do not  have  5  bits  in  the  PTE to
represent  all the keys; we only have 3bits. Two of those
keys are reserved; pkey 0 and pkey 1. So effectively  we
have 6 pkeys.

This patch keeps track of reserved keys, allocated  keys
and keys that are currently free.

Also it  adds  skeletal  functions  and macros, that the
architecture-independent code expects to be available.
