elf: fix NT_FILE integer overflow

If vm.max_map_count bumped above 2^26 (67+ mil) and system has enough RAM
to allocate all the VMAs (~12.8 GB on Fedora 27 with 200-byte VMAs), then
it should be possible to overflow 32-bit "size", pass paranoia check,
allocate very little vmalloc space and oops while writing into vmalloc
guard page...

But I didn't test this, only coredump of regular process.
