rt2x00: do not pause queue unconditionally on error path

Pausing queue without checking threshold is racy with txdone path.
Moreover we do not need pause queue on any error, but only if queue
is full - in case when we send RTS frame ( other cases of almost full
queue are already handled in rt2x00queue_write_tx_frame() ).

Patch fixes of theoretically possible problem of pausing empty
queue.
