i40evf: Do not clear MSI-X PBA manually

We should not be clearing the pending bit array for each vector manually.
The documentation for the hardware states that when in MSI-X mode the
pending bit array will be cleared automatically. Us clearing it ourselves
just results in multiple opportunities for us to drop an interrupt.
