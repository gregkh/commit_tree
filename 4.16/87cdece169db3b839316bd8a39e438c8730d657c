ACPICA: DT compiler: prevent error if optional field at the end of table is not present

ACPICA commit a7f73af9003bf4e730db5a133300c01ba7992a01

The data table compiler throws under the following conditions:
 1.) there is a table with a last field that is optional
 2.) if the optional field is not present
 3.) the optional field is the last line of the data table

A change was made to dt_compile_table to return an AE_EOF under
these conditions.  This AE_EOF means that we are at the end of the
file.  The caller to dt_compile_table() is responsible for handling
this case. For DBG2 table, we will complete the compilation of this
subtable.  For other tables, this could be different.
