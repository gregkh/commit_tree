ntb_hw_switchtec: Create helper function to setup reserved LUT MWs

This is a prep patch in order to support the crosslink feature which
will require the driver to use another reserved LUT window. To
simplify this we move the code which sets up the reserved LUT window
into a helper function which will be used by the crosslink
initialization.
