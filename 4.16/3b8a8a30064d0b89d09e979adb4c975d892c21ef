drm/i915: Add information needed to track engine preempt state

We shouldn't inspect ELSP context status (or any other bits depending on
specific submission backend) when using GuC submission.
Let's use another piece of HWSP for preempt context, to write its bit of
information, meaning that preemption has finished, and hardware is now
idle.
