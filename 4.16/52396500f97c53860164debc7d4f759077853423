powerpc/64s: Fix i-side SLB miss bad address handler saving nonvolatile GPRs

The SLB bad address handler's trap number fixup does not preserve the
low bit that indicates nonvolatile GPRs have not been saved. This
leads save_nvgprs to skip saving them, and subsequent functions and
return from interrupt will think they are saved.

This causes kernel branch-to-garbage debugging to not have correct
registers, can also cause userspace to have its registers clobbered
after a segfault.
