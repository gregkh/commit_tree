loop: Fix lost writes caused by missing flag

The following commit:

commit aa4d86163e4e ("block: loop: switch to VFS ITER_BVEC")

replaced __do_lo_send_write(), which used ITER_KVEC iterators, with
lo_write_bvec() which uses ITER_BVEC iterators.  In this change, though,
the WRITE flag was lost:

-       iov_iter_kvec(&from, ITER_KVEC | WRITE, &kvec, 1, len);
+       iov_iter_bvec(&i, ITER_BVEC, bvec, 1, bvec->bv_len);

This flag is necessary for the DAX case because we make decisions based on
whether or not the iterator is a READ or a WRITE in dax_iomap_actor() and
in dax_iomap_rw().

We end up going through this path in configurations where we combine a PMEM
device with 4k sectors, a loopback device and DAX.  The consequence of this
missed flag is that what we intend as a write actually turns into a read in
the DAX code, so no data is ever written.

The very simplest test case is to create a loopback device and try and
write a small string to it, then hexdump a few bytes of the device to see
if the write took.  Without this patch you read back all zeros, with this
you read back the string you wrote.

For XFS this causes us to fail or panic during the following xfstests:

	xfs/074 xfs/078 xfs/216 xfs/217 xfs/250

For ext4 we have a similar issue where writes never happen, but we don't
currently have any xfstests that use loopback and show this issue.

Fix this by restoring the WRITE flag argument to iov_iter_bvec().  This
causes the xfstests to all pass.
