crypto: inside-secure - move request dequeueing into a workqueue

This patch moves the request dequeueing into a workqueue to improve the
coalescing of interrupts when sending requests to the engine; as the
engine is capable of having one single interrupt for n requests sent.
Using a workqueue allows to send more request at once.
