ntb_transport: Fix bug with max_mw_size parameter

When using the max_mw_size parameter of ntb_transport to limit the size of
the Memory windows, communication cannot be established and the queues
freeze.

This is because the mw_size that's reported to the peer is correctly
limited but the size used locally is not. So the MW is initialized
with a buffer smaller than the window but the TX side is using the
full window. This means the TX side will be writing to a region of the
window that points nowhere.

This is easily fixed by applying the same limit to tx_size in
ntb_transport_init_queue().
