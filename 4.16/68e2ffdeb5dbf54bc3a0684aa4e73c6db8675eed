net/ipv6: Handle onlink flag with multipath routes

For multipath routes the ONLINK flag can be specified per nexthop in
rtnh_flags or globally in rtm_flags. Update ip6_route_multipath_add
to consider the ONLINK setting coming from rtnh_flags. Each loop over
nexthops the config for the sibling route is initialized to the global
config and then per nexthop settings overlayed. The flag is 'or'ed into
fib6_config to handle the ONLINK flag coming from either rtm_flags or
rtnh_flags.
