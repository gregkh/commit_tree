drm/i915: Move init_clock_gating() back to where it was

Apparently setting up a bunch of GT registers before we've properly
initialized the rest of the GT hardware leads to these setting being
lost. So looks like I broke HSW with commit b7048ea12fbb ("drm/i915:
Do .init_clock_gating() earlier to avoid it clobbering watermarks")
by doing init_clock_gating() too early. This should actually affect
other platforms as well, but apparently not to such a great degree.

What I was ultimately after in that commit was to move the
ilk_init_lp_watermarks() call earlier. So let's undo the damage and
move init_clock_gating() back to where it was, and call
ilk_init_lp_watermarks() just before the watermark state readout.

This highlights how fragile and messed up our init order really is.
I wonder why we even initialize the display before gem. The opposite
order would make much more sense to me...

v2: Keep WaRsPkgCStateDisplayPMReq:hsw early as it really must
    be done before all planes might get disabled.
