btrfs: Reduce scope of delayed_rsv->lock in may_commit_trans

After commit 996478ca9c460886ac1 ("btrfs: change how we decide to commit
transactions during flushing") there is no need to hold the delayed_rsv
during the percpu_counter_compare call since we get the byte's snapshot
earlier. So hold the lock only while reading delayed_rsv.
