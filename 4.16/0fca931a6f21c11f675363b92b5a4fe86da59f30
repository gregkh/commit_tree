samples/bpf: program demonstrating access to xdp_rxq_info

This sample program can be used for monitoring and reporting how many
packets per sec (pps) are received per NIC RX queue index and which
CPU processed the packet. In itself it is a useful tool for quickly
identifying RSS imbalance issues, see below.

The default XDP action is XDP_PASS in-order to provide a monitor
mode. For benchmarking purposes it is possible to specify other XDP
actions on the cmdline --action.

Output below shows an imbalance RSS case where most RXQ's deliver to
CPU-0 while CPU-2 only get packets from a single RXQ.  Looking at
things from a CPU level the two CPUs are processing approx the same
amount, BUT looking at the rx_queue_index levels it is clear that
RXQ-2 receive much better service, than other RXQs which all share CPU-0.
