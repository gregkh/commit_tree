nfp: protect each repr pointer individually with RCU

Representors are grouped in sets by type.  Currently the whole
sets are under RCU protection, but individual representor pointers
are not.  This causes some inconveniences when representors have
to be destroyed, because we have to allocate new sets to remove
any representors.  Protect the individual pointers with RCU.
