serial: fsl_lpuart: Support common rs485 binding for RTS polarity

Invoke the ->rs485_config callback on probe to set UARTMODEM_TXRTSPOL
appropriately based on the UART's device properties.

This implicitly sets UARTMODEM_TXRTSE if rs485 was enabled in the device
properties, so drop the identical code from lpuart_probe().

It also fixes a bug:  If an unsupported rs485 property was specified
(rs485-rx-during-tx or rs485-rts-delay), the driver returns -ENOSYS
without performing any cleanup, in particular without calling
uart_remove_one_port() or clk_disable_unprepare(), thus leaking the
uart_port. But with the invocation of ->rs485_config, the unsupported
properties are now cleared in struct serial_rs485 and thus ignored.
It therefore seems sufficient to just log an error instead of bailing
out.
