nvmet: fix PSDT field check in command format

PSDT field section according to NVM_Express-1.3:
"This field specifies whether PRPs or SGLs are used for any data
transfer associated with the command. PRPs shall be used for all
Admin commands for NVMe over PCIe. SGLs shall be used for all Admin
and I/O commands for NVMe over Fabrics. This field shall be set to
01b for NVMe over Fabrics 1.0 implementations.
