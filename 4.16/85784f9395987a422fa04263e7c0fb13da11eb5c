ceph: only dirty ITER_IOVEC pages for direct read

If a page is already locked, attempting to dirty it leads to a deadlock
in lock_page().  This is what currently happens to ITER_BVEC pages when
a dio-enabled loop device is backed by ceph:

  $ losetup --direct-io /dev/loop0 /mnt/cephfs/img
  $ xfs_io -c 'pread 0 4k' /dev/loop0

Follow other file systems and only dirty ITER_IOVEC pages.
