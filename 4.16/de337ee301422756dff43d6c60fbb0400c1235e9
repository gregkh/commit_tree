irqchip/gic-v2m: Add PCI Multi-MSI support

We'd never implemented Multi-MSI support with GICv2m, because
it is weird and clunky, and you'd think people would rather use
MSI-X.

Turns out there is still plenty of devices out there that rely
on Multi-MSI. Oh well, let's teach that trick to the v2m widget,
it is not a big deal anyway.
