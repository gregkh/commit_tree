scsi: lpfc: small sg cnt cleanup

The logic for sg_seg_cnt is a bit convoluted. This patch tries to clean
up a couple of areas, especially around the +2 and +1 logic.

This patch:

- Cleans up the lpfc_sg_seg_cnt attribute to specify a real minimum
  rather than making the minimum be whatever the default is.

- Removes the hardcoding of +2 (for the number of elements we use in a
  sgl for cmd iu and rsp iu) and +1 (an additional entry to compensate
  for nvme's reduction of io size based on a possible partial page)
  logic in sg list initialization. In the case where the +1 logic is
  referenced in host and target io checks, use the values set in the
  transport template as that value was properly set.

There can certainly be more done in this area and it will be addressed
in combined host/target driver effort.
