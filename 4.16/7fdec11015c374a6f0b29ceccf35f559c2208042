atmel_flexcom: Support resuming after a chip reset

The controller used by a flexcom module is configured at boot, and left
alone after this. In the suspend mode called "backup with self-refresh"
available on SAMA5D2, the chip will resume with most of its registers
reset. In this case, we need to restore the state of the flexcom driver
on resume.
