i40e/i40evf: Record ITR register location in the q_vector

The drivers for i40e and i40evf had a reg_idx value stored in the q_vector
that was going completely unused. I can only assume this was copied over
from ixgbe and nobody knew how to use it.

I'm going to make use of the value to avoid having to compute the vector
and thus the register index for multiple paths throughout the drivers.
