crypto: marvell/cesa - Fix DMA API misuse

phys_to_dma() is an internal helper for certain DMA API implementations,
and is not appropriate for drivers to use. It appears that what the CESA
driver really wants to be using is dma_map_resource() - admittedly that
didn't exist when the offending code was first merged, but it does now.
