RDMA/core: Do not use invalid destination in determining port reuse

cma_port_is_unique() allows local port reuse if the quad (source
address and port, destination address and port) for this connection
is unique. However, if the destination info is zero or unspecified, it
can't make a correct decision but still allows port reuse. For example,
sometimes rdma_bind_addr() is called with unspecified destination and
reusing the port can lead to creating a connection with a duplicate quad,
after the destination is resolved. The issue manifests when MPI scale-up
tests hang after the duplicate quad is used.

Set the destination address family and add checks for zero destination
address and port to prevent source port reuse based on invalid destination.
