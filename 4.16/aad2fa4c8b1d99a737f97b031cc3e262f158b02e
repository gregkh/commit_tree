media: vivid: use ktime_t for timestamp calculation

timespec is generally deprecated because of the y2038 overflow.
In vivid, the usage is fine, since we are dealing with monotonic
timestamps, but we can also simplify the code by going to ktime_t.

Using ktime_divns() should be roughly as efficient as the old code,
since the constant 64-bit division gets turned into a multiplication
on modern platforms, and we save multiple 32-bit divisions that can be
expensive e.g. on ARMv7.
