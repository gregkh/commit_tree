x86/mce/AMD: Don't set DEF_INT_TYPE in MSR_CU_DEF_ERR on SMCA systems

The McaIntrCfg register (MSRC000_0410), previously known as CU_DEFER_ERR,
is used on SMCA systems to set the LVT offset for the Threshold and
Deferred error interrupts.

This register was used on non-SMCA systems to also set the Deferred
interrupt type in bits 2:1. However, these bits are reserved on SMCA
systems.

Only set MSRC000_0410[2:1] on non-SMCA systems.
