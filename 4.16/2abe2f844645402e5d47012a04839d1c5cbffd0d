drm/i915: Allow fence allocations to fail

If a fence allocation fails in a blocking context, we will sleep on the
fence as a last resort. We can therefore allow ourselves to fail and
sleep on the fence instead of triggering a system-wide oom. This allows
us to throttle malicious clients that are consuming lots of system
resources by capping the amount of memory used by fences.
