media: staging: remove lirc_zilog driver

The ir-kbd-i2c driver behaves like the lirc_zilog driver, except it can
send raw IR and receives scancodes rather than lirccodes.

The lirc_zilog driver only polls if the lirc chardev is opened;
similarly the ir-kbd-i2c driver only polls if the corresponding input
device is opened, or the lirc device.

Polling is disabled during IR transmission through the mutex.

The polling period is 402ms in the ir-kdb-i2c driver, and 260ms in the
lirc_zilog driver.
