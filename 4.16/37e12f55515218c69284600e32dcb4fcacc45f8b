cifs: remove redundant duplicated assignment of pointer 'node'

Node is assigned twice to rb_first(root), first during declaration
time and second after a taking a spin lock, so we have a duplicated
assignment.  Remove the first assignment because it is redundant and
also not protected by the spin lock.

Cleans up clang warning:
fs/cifs/connect.c:4435:18: warning: Value stored to 'node' during
its initialization is never read
