IB/rdmavt: Allocate CQ memory on the correct node

CQ allocation does not ensure that completion queue entries
and the completion queue structure are allocated on the correct
numa node.

Fix by allocating the rvt_cq and kernel CQ entries on the device node,
leaving the user CQ entries on the default local node.  Also ensure
CQ resizes use the correct allocator when extending a CQ.
