iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: add regmap API support

Introduce regmap API support to access to i2c/spi bus instead of
using a custom support. Set max bulk read to
(32 / SAMPLE_SIZE) * SAMPLE_SIZE since spi_write_then_read() used in
regmap_spi indicates that is the max buffer length to use in order to
avoid a kmalloc for each bus access.
Remove lock mutex since concurrency is already managed by regmap API
