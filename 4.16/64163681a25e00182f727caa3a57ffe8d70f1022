thermal: armada: Wait sensors validity before exiting the init callback

The thermal core will check for sensors validity right after the
initialization callback has returned. As the initialization routine make
a reset, the sensors are not ready immediately and the core spawns an
error in the dmesg. Avoid this annoying situation by polling on the
validity bit before exiting from these routines. This also avoid the use
of blind sleeps.
