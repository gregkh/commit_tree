net: hns3: Add HNS3 VF HCL(Hardware Compatibility Layer) Support

This patch adds the support of hardware compatibiltiy layer to the
HNS3 VF Driver. This layer implements various {set|get} operations
over MAC address for a virtual port, RSS related configuration,
fetches the link status info from PF, does various VLAN related
configuration over the virtual port, queries the statistics from
the hardware etc.

This layer can directly interact with hardware through the
IMP(Integrated Mangement Processor) interface or can use mailbox
to interact with the PF driver.
