sched/fair: Use 'unsigned long' for utilization, consistently

Utilization and capacity are tracked as 'unsigned long', however some
functions using them return an 'int' which is ultimately assigned back to
'unsigned long' variables.

Since there is not scope on using a different and signed type,
consolidate the signature of functions returning utilization to always
use the native type.

This change improves code consistency, and it also benefits
code paths where utilizations should be clamped by avoiding
further type conversions or ugly type casts.
