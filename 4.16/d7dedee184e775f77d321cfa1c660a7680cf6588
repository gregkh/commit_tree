ipv6: Calculate hash thresholds for IPv6 nexthops

Before we convert IPv6 to use hash-threshold instead of modulo-N, we
first need each nexthop to store its region boundary in the hash
function's output space.

The boundary is calculated by dividing the output space equally between
the different active nexthops. That is, nexthops that are not dead or
linkdown.

The boundaries are rebalanced whenever a nexthop is added or removed to
a multipath route and whenever a nexthop becomes active or inactive.
