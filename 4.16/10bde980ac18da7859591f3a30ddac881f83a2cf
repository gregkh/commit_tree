scsi: scsi_debug: delay stress fix

Introduce a state enum into sdebug_defer objects to indicate which, if
any, defer method has been used with the associated command.  Also add 2
bools to indicate which of the defer methods has been initialized. Those
objects are re-used but the initialization only needs to be done
once. This simplifies command cancellation handling.

Now the delay associated with a deferred response of a command cannot be
changed (once started) by changing the delay (and ndelay) parameters in
sysfs. Command aborts and driver shutdown are still honoured immediately
when received.
