ipv6: Set nexthop flags upon carrier change

Similar to IPv4, when the carrier of a netdev changes we should toggle
the 'linkdown' flag on all the nexthops using it as their nexthop
device.

This will later allow us to test for the presence of this flag during
route lookup and dump.

Up until commit 4832c30d5458 ("net: ipv6: put host and anycast routes on
device with address") host and anycast routes used the loopback netdev
as their nexthop device and thus were not marked with the 'linkdown'
flag. The patch preserves this behavior and allows one to ping the local
address even when the nexthop device does not have a carrier and the
'ignore_routes_with_linkdown' sysctl is set.
