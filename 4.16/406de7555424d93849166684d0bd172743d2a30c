ptr_ring: keep consumer_head valid at all times

The comment near __ptr_ring_peek says:

 * If ring is never resized, and if the pointer is merely
 * tested, there's no need to take the lock - see e.g.  __ptr_ring_empty.

but this was in fact never possible since consumer_head would sometimes
point outside the ring. Refactor the code so that it's always
pointing within a ring.
