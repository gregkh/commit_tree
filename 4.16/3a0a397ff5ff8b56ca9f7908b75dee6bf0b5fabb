arm64: Kill PSCI_GET_VERSION as a variant-2 workaround

Now that we've standardised on SMCCC v1.1 to perform the branch
prediction invalidation, let's drop the previous band-aid.
If vendors haven't updated their firmware to do SMCCC 1.1, they
haven't updated PSCI either, so we don't loose anything.
