drm/prime: skip CPU sync in map/unmap dma_buf

Dma-bufs should already be device coherent, as they are only pulled in the
CPU domain via the begin/end cpu_access calls. As we cache the mapping set
up by dma_map_sg a CPU sync at this point will not actually guarantee proper
coherency on non-coherent architectures, so we can as well stop pretending.

This is an important performance fix for architectures which need explicit
cache synchronization and userspace doing lots of dma-buf imports.
Improves Weston on Etnaviv performance 5x, where before this patch > 90%
of Weston CPU time was spent synchronizing caches for buffers which are
already device coherent.
