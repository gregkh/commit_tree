drivers: core: arch_topology.c: move SPDX tag to top of the file

arch_topology.c had a SPDX tag in it, so move it to the top of the file
like the rest of the kernel files have it.

Also remove the redundant license text as it is not needed if the SPDX
tag is in the file, as the tag identifies the license in a specific and
legally-defined manner.

This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
needed.

No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.
