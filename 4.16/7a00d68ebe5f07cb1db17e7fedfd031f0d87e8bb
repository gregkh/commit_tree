arm64: sysreg: Move to use definitions for all the SCTLR bits

__cpu_setup() configures SCTLR_EL1 using some hard coded hex masks,
and el2_setup() duplicates some this when setting RES1 bits.

Lets make this the same as KVM's hyp_init, which uses named bits.

First, we add definitions for all the SCTLR_EL{1,2} bits, the RES{1,0}
bits, and those we want to set or clear.

Add a build_bug checks to ensures all bits are either set or clear.
This means we don't need to preserve endian-ness configuration
generated elsewhere.

Finally, move the head.S and proc.S users of these hard-coded masks
over to the macro versions.
