drm/amdgpu:don't change ctx->reset_couner upon query

reset_counter marks the reset counter number once the context
is created, shouldn't be changed due to query.

To keep U/K interface on the ctx_query and keep ctx's reset_counter
logic compatible with GPU RESET feature, now use another var named
"reset_counter_query" to replace the original checked & updated in
amdgpu_ctx_query.
