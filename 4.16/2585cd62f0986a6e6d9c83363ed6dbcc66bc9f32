bpf: Only reply field should be writeable

Currently, a sock_ops BPF program can write the op field and all the
reply fields (reply and replylong). This is a bug. The op field should
not have been writeable and there is currently no way to use replylong
field for indices >= 1. This patch enforces that only the reply field
(which equals replylong[0]) is writeable.
