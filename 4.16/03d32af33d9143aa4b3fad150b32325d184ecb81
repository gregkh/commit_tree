scsi: bfa: improve bfa_ioc_send_enable/disable data

In bfa_ioc_send_enable, we use the deprecated do_gettimeofday() function
to read the current time. This is not a problem, since the firmware
interface is already limited to 32-bit timestamps, but it's better to
use ktime_get_seconds() and document what the limitation is.

I noticed that I did the same change in commit a5af83925363 ("bna: avoid
writing uninitialized data into hw registers") for the ethernet
driver. That commit also changed the "disable" funtion to initialize the
data we pass to the firmware properly, so I'm doing the same thing here.
