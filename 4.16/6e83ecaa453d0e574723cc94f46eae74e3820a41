ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: fix clkctrl address translation logic

There are cases where clkctrl clock offsets do not match the corresponding
clockdomain, and this case the existing mapping functionality will fail.
Fix this by adding the whole address range for a clkctrl provider and
matching the actual clkctrl registers against these ranges.
