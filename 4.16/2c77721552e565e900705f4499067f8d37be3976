powerpc: Move of_drconf_cell struct to asm/drmem.h

Now that the powerpc code parses dynamic reconfiguration memory
LMB information from the LMB array and not the device tree
directly we can move the of_drconf_cell struct to drmem.h where
it fits better.

In addition, the struct is renamed to of_drconf_cell_v1 in
anticipation of upcoming support for version 2 of the dynamic
reconfiguration property and the members are typed as __be*
values to reflect how they exist in the device tree.
