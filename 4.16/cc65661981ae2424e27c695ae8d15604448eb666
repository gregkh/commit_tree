dm unstripe: fix target length versus number of stripes size check

Since the unstripe target takes a target length which is the
size of *one* striped member we're trying to expose, not the
total size of *all* the striped members, the check does not
make sense and fails for some striped setups.

For example, say we have a 4TB striped device:
or 3907018496 sectors per underlying device:

if (sector_div(width, uc->stripes)) :
   3907018496 / 2(num stripes)  == 1953509248

tmp_len = width;
if (sector_div(tmp_len, uc->chunk_size)) :
   1953509248 / 256(chunk size) == 7630895.5
   (fails)

Fix this by removing the first check which isn't valid for unstriping.
