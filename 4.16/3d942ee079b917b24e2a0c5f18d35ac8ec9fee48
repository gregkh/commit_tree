ipc/shm.c: add split function to shm_vm_ops

If System V shmget/shmat operations are used to create a hugetlbfs
backed mapping, it is possible to munmap part of the mapping and split
the underlying vma such that it is not huge page aligned.  This will
untimately result in the following BUG:

This bug was introduced by commit 31383c6865a5 ("mm, hugetlbfs:
introduce ->split() to vm_operations_struct").  A split function was
added to vm_operations_struct to determine if a mapping can be split.
This was mostly for device-dax and hugetlbfs mappings which have
specific alignment constraints.

Mappings initiated via shmget/shmat have their original vm_ops
overwritten with shm_vm_ops.  shm_vm_ops functions will call back to the
original vm_ops if needed.  Add such a split function to shm_vm_ops.
