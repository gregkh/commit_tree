netlink: put module reference if dump start fails

Before, if cb->start() failed, the module reference would never be put,
because cb->cb_running is intentionally false at this point. Users are
generally annoyed by this because they can no longer unload modules that
leak references. Also, it may be possible to tediously wrap a reference
counter back to zero, especially since module.c still uses atomic_inc
instead of refcount_inc.

This patch expands the error path to simply call module_put if
cb->start() fails.
