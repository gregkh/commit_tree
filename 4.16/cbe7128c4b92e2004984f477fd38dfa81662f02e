vlan: Fix out of order vlan headers with reorder header off

With reorder header off, received packets are untagged in skb_vlan_untag()
called from within __netif_receive_skb_core(), and later the tag will be
inserted back in vlan_do_receive().

This caused out of order vlan headers when we create a vlan device on top
of another vlan device, because vlan_do_receive() inserts a tag as the
outermost vlan tag. E.g. the outer tag is first removed in skb_vlan_untag()
and inserted back in vlan_do_receive(), then the inner tag is next removed
and inserted back as the outermost tag.

This patch fixes the behaviour by inserting the inner tag at the right
position.
