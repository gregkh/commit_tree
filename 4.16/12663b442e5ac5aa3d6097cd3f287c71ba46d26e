mtd: mtd_oobtest: Handle bitflips during reads

Reads from NAND devices usually trigger bitflips, this is an expected
behavior. While bitflips are under a given threshold, the MTD core
returns 0. However, when the number of corrected bitflips is above this
same threshold, -EUCLEAN is returned to inform the upper layer that this
block is slightly dying and soon the ECC engine will be overtaken so
actions should be taken to move the data out of it.

This particular condition should not be treated like an error and the
test should continue.
