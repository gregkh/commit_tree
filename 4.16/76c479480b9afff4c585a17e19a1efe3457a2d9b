nfsd: encode stat->mtime for getattr instead of inode->i_mtime

The values of stat->mtime and inode->i_mtime may differ for overlayfs
and stat->mtime is the correct value to use when encoding getattr.
This is also consistent with the fact that other attr times are also
encoded from stat values.

Both callers of lease_get_mtime() already have the value of stat->mtime,
so the only needed change is that lease_get_mtime() will not overwrite
this value with inode->i_mtime in case the inode does not have an
exclusive lease.
