ntb_hw_switchtec: Allow using Switchtec NTB in multi-partition setups

Allow using Switchtec NTB in setups that have more than two partitions.
Note: this does not enable having multi-host communication, it only
allows for a single NTB link between two hosts in a network that might
have more than two.

Use following logic to determine the NT peer partition:

1) If there are 2 partitions, and the target vector is set in
   the Switchtec configuration, use the partition specified in target
   vector.
2) If there are 2 partitions and target vector is unset
   use the only other partition as specified in the NT EP map.
3) If there are more than 2 partitions and target vector is set
   use the other partition specified in target vector.
4) If there are more than 2 partitions and target vector is unset,
   this is invalid and report an error.
