net/mlx5: E-Switch, Simplify representor load/unload callback API

In the load() callback for loading representors we don't really need
struct mlx5_eswitch but struct mlx5_core_dev, pass it directly.

In the unload() callback for unloading representors we don't need the
struct mlx5_eswitch argument, remove it.
