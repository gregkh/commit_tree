ASoC: eukrea-tlv320: Remove include line of fsl_ssi.h

The machine driver links both imx-ssi (legacy non-DT driver) and
fsl_ssi (up-to-date DT based driver). So It also includes both
imx-ssi.h and fsl_ssi.h header files. This creates a limitation
for two header files -- they can't define anything with identical
names.

Since the eukrea-tlv320 machine driver now does not really need
anything being defined in the fsl_ssi header file, and it's also
going to take some time to clean up two SSI drivers, this patch
takes a quick way to remove the #include fsl_ssi.h line for now.
It can be added back once the header files are done refactoring.

The eukrea-tlv320 driver is still compiled successfully without
any erorr using imx_v6_v7_defconfig, after removing it.
