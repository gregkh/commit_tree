arm64: capabilities: Handle duplicate entries for a capability

Sometimes a single capability could be listed multiple times with
differing matches(), e.g, CPU errata for different MIDR versions.
This breaks verify_local_cpu_feature() and this_cpu_has_cap() as
we stop checking for a capability on a CPU with the first
entry in the given table, which is not sufficient. Make sure we
run the checks for all entries of the same capability. We do
this by fixing __this_cpu_has_cap() to run through all the
entries in the given table for a match and reuse it for
verify_local_cpu_feature().
