net: stmmac: dwmac-meson8b: only configure the clocks in RGMII mode

Neither the m25_div_clk nor the m250_div_clk or m250_mux_clk are used in
RMII mode. The m25_div_clk output is routed to the RGMII PHY's "RGMII
clock".
This means that we don't need to configure the clocks in RMII mode. The
driver however did this - with no effect since the clocks are not routed
to the PHY in RMII mode.

While here also rename meson8b_init_clk to meson8b_init_rgmii_tx_clk to
make it easier to understand the code.
