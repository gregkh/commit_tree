drm/i915/cnl: Allow 2 pixel per clock on Cannonlake.

This is heavily based on a initial patch provided by Ville
plus all changes provided later by Ander.

As Geminilake, Cannonlake also supports 2 pixels per clock.

Different from Geminilake we are not implementing the 99% Wa.
But we can revisit that decision later if we find out
any limitation on later CNL SKUs.

v2: Rebase on top of commit 'd305e0614601 ("drm/i915: Track
minimum acceptable cdclk instead of "minimum dotclock")'

v3: When fixing HDMI on CNL I noticed that I missed to convert
    back the doubled pixel rate to cdclk.
