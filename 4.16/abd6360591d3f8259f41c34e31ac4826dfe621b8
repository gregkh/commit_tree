batman-adv: fix packet checksum in receive path

eth_type_trans() internally calls skb_pull(), which does not adjust the
skb checksum; skb_postpull_rcsum() is necessary to avoid log spam of the
form "bat0: hw csum failure" when packets with CHECKSUM_COMPLETE are
received.

Note that in usual setups, packets don't reach batman-adv with
CHECKSUM_COMPLETE (I assume NICs bail out of checksumming when they see
batadv's ethtype?), which is why the log messages do not occur on every
system using batman-adv. I could reproduce this issue by stacking
batman-adv on top of a VXLAN interface.
