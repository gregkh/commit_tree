bpf: sockmap sample, use fork() for send and recv

Currently for SENDMSG tests first send completes then recv runs. This
does not work well for large data sizes and/or many iterations. So
fork the recv and send handler so that we run both send and recv. In
the future we can add a parameter to do more than a single fork of
tx/rx.

With this we can get many GBps of data which helps exercise the
sockmap code.
