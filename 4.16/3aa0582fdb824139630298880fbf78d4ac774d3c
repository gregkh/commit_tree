of: platform: populate /firmware/ node from of_platform_default_populate_init()

Since "/firmware" does not have its own "compatible" property as it's
just collection of nodes representing firmware interface, it's sub-nodes
are not populated during system initialization.

Currently different firmware drivers search the /firmware/ node and
populate the sub-node devices selectively. Instead we can populate
the /firmware/ node during init to avoid more drivers continuing to
populate the devices selectively.

To generalize the solution this patch populates the /firmware/ node
explicitly from of_platform_default_populate_init().
