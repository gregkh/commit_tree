signal: Simplify and fix kdb_send_sig

- Rename from kdb_send_sig_info to kdb_send_sig
  As there is no meaningful siginfo sent

- Use SEND_SIG_PRIV instead of generating a siginfo for a kdb
  signal.  The generated siginfo had a bogus rationale and was
  not correct in the face of pid namespaces.  SEND_SIG_PRIV
  is simpler and actually correct.

- As the code grabs siglock just send the signal with siglock
  held instead of dropping siglock and attempting to grab it again.

- Move the sig_valid test into kdb_kill where it can generate
  a good error message.
