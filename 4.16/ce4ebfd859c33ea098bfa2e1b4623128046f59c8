nfp: bpf: add helpers for updating immediate instructions

Immediate loads are used to load the return address of a helper.
We need to be able to update those loads for relocations.
Immediate loads can be slightly more complex and spread over
two instructions in general, but here we only care about simple
loads of small (< 65k) constants, so complex cases are not handled.
