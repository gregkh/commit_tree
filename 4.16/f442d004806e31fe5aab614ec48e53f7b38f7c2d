powerpc/64s: Add support to mask perf interrupts and replay them

Two new bit mask field "IRQ_DISABLE_MASK_PMU" is introduced to support
the masking of PMI and "IRQ_DISABLE_MASK_ALL" to aid interrupt masking
checking.

Couple of new irq #defs "PACA_IRQ_PMI" and "SOFTEN_VALUE_0xf0*" added
to use in the exception code to check for PMI interrupts.

In the masked_interrupt handler, for PMIs we reset the MSR[EE] and
return. In the __check_irq_replay(), replay the PMI interrupt by
calling performance_monitor_common handler.
