arm_pmu: acpi: request IRQs up-front

We can't request IRQs in atomic context, so for ACPI systems we'll have
to request them up-front, and later associate them with CPUs.

This patch reorganises the arm_pmu code to do so. As we no longer have
the arm_pmu structure at probe time, a number of prototypes need to be
adjusted, requiring changes to the common arm_pmu code and arm_pmu
platform code.
