virt: Add vboxguest driver for Virtual Box Guest integration UAPI

This commit adds the headers describing the ioctl API for the
/dev/vboxguest device used by the Virtual Box Guest Additions
in Virtual Box virtual machines.

The driver providing the /dev/vboxguest device will allow Virtual Box
Guest Additions features such as copy-and-paste, seamless mode and
OpenGL pass-through.
