Input: goodix - use generic touchscreen_properties

Use touchscreen_properties structure instead of implementing all
properties by our own. It allows us to reuse generic code for parsing
device-tree properties (which was implemented manually in the driver for
now). Additionally, it allows us to report events using generic
touchscreen_report_pos(), which automatically handles inverted and
swapped axes.

This fixes the issue with the custom code incorrectly handling case where
ts->inverted_x and ts->swapped_x_y were true, but ts->inverted_y was
false. Assuming we have 720x1280 touch panel, ts->abs_x_max == 1279 and
ts->abs_y_max == 719 (because we inverted that in goodix_read_config()).
Now let's assume that we received event from (0:0) position (in touch
panel original coordinates). In function goodix_ts_report_touch() we
calculate input_x as 1279, but after swapping input_y takes that value
(which is more that maximum 719 value reported during initialization).

Note that since touchscreen coordinates are 0-indexed, we now report
touchscreen range as (0:size-1).

Developed and tested on custom DT-based device with gt1151 touch
panel.
