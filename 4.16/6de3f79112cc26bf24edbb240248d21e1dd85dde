arm_pmu: explicitly enable/disable SPIs at hotplug

To support ACPI systems, we need to request IRQs before CPUs are
hotplugged, and thus we need to request IRQs before we know their
associated PMU.

This is problematic if a PMU IRQ is pending out of reset, as it may be
taken before we know the PMU, and thus the IRQ handler won't be able to
handle it, leaving it screaming.

To avoid such problems, lets request all IRQs in a disabled state, and
explicitly enable/disable them at hotplug time, when we're sure the PMU
has been probed.
