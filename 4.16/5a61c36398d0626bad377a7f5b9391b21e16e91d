blk-mq: remove REQ_ATOM_STARTED

After the recent updates to use generation number and state based
synchronization, we can easily replace REQ_ATOM_STARTED usages by
adding an extra state to distinguish completed but not yet freed
state.

Add MQ_RQ_COMPLETE and replace REQ_ATOM_STARTED usages with
blk_mq_rq_state() tests.  REQ_ATOM_STARTED no longer has any users
left and is removed.
