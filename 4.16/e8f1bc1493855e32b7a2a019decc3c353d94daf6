Btrfs: fix btrfs_evict_inode to handle abnormal inodes correctly

This regression is introduced in
commit 3d48d9810de4 ("btrfs: Handle uninitialised inode eviction").

There are two problems,

a) it is ->destroy_inode() that does the final free on inode, not
   ->evict_inode(),
b) clear_inode() must be called before ->evict_inode() returns.

This could end up hitting BUG_ON(inode->i_state != (I_FREEING | I_CLEAR));
in evict() because I_CLEAR is set in clear_inode().

Fixes: commit 3d48d9810de4 ("btrfs: Handle uninitialised inode eviction")
