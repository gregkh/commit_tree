libnvdimm, {btt, blk}: do integrity setup before add_disk()

Prior to 25520d55cdb6 ("block: Inline blk_integrity in struct gendisk")
we needed to temporarily add a zero-capacity disk before registering for
blk-integrity. But adding a zero-capacity disk caused the partition
table scanning to bail early, and this resulted in partitions not coming
up after a probe of the BTT or blk namespaces.

We can now register for integrity before the disk has been added, and
this fixes the rescan problems.
