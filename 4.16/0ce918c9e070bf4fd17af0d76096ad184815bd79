ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: Reset registers during power up

Add a reset function that toggles the reset line if available or uses
the software reset command otherwise. Use this in power up to ensure the
registers are in a sane state. This is useful when the driver module
is reloaded, or after Kexec, warm-reboots, etc..
