mm/memcontrol.c: try harder to decrease [memory,memsw].limit_in_bytes

mem_cgroup_resize_[memsw]_limit() tries to free only 32
(SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX) pages on each iteration.  This makes it practically
impossible to decrease limit of memory cgroup.  Tasks could easily
allocate back 32 pages, so we can't reduce memory usage, and once
retry_count reaches zero we return -EBUSY.

Easy to reproduce the problem by running the following commands:

  mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/test
  echo $$ >> /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/test/tasks
  cat big_file > /dev/null &
  sleep 1 && echo $((100*1024*1024)) > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/test/memory.limit_in_bytes
  -bash: echo: write error: Device or resource busy

Instead of relying on retry_count, keep retrying the reclaim until the
desired limit is reached or fail if the reclaim doesn't make any
progress or a signal is pending.
