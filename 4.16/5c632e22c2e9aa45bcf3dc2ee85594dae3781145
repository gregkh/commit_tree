drm/bridge/sii8620: add DVI mode support

If the sink device is in HDMI mode, enable infoframe interrupt in scdt
irq handle function else call start_video function immediately, because
in DVI mode, there is no infoframe interrupt provided.

Rename start_hdmi function to start_video and get rid of the old
start_video function. In start_video, if the sink is DVI and mode is
MHL1 or MHl2, write appropriate values to registers else the path
should remain the same as in HDMI mode.
