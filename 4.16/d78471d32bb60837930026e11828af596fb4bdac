pnfs/blocklayout: set PNFS_LAYOUTRETURN_ON_ERROR

If there's an error doing I/O to block device, and the client resends the
I/O to the MDS, the MDS must recall the layout from the client before
processing the I/O.  Let's preempt that exchange by returning the layout
before falling back to the MDS when there's an error.
