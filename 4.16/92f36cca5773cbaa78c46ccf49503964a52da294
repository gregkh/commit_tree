spinlock: Add library function to allocate spinlock buckets array

Add two new library functions: alloc_bucket_spinlocks and
free_bucket_spinlocks. These are used to allocate and free an array
of spinlocks that are useful as locks for hash buckets. The interface
specifies the maximum number of spinlocks in the array as well
as a CPU multiplier to derive the number of spinlocks to allocate.
The number allocated is rounded up to a power of two to make the
array amenable to hash lookup.
