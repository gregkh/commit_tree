xfs: always zero di_flags2 when we free the inode

Always zero the di_flags2 field when we free the inode so that we never
end up with an on-disk record for an unallocated inode that also has the
reflink iflag set.  This is in keeping with the general principle that
only files can have the reflink iflag set, even though we'll zero out
di_flags2 if we ever reallocate the inode.
