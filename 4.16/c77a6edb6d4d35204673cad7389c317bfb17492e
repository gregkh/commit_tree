ALSA: x86: Fix potential crash at error path

When LPE audio driver gets some error at probing, it may lead to a
crash because of canceling the pending work in hdmi_lpe_audio_free(),
since some of ports might be still not initialized.

For assuring the proper free of each port, initialize all ports at the
beginning of the probe.
