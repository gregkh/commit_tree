KVM: x86: fix backward migration with async_PF

Guests on new hypersiors might set KVM_ASYNC_PF_DELIVERY_AS_PF_VMEXIT
bit when enabling async_PF, but this bit is reserved on old hypervisors,
which results in a failure upon migration.

To avoid breaking different cases, we are checking for CPUID feature bit
before enabling the feature and nothing else.
