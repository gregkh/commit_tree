xhci: Don't print a warning when setting link state for disabled ports

When disabling a USB3 port the hub driver will set the port link state to
U3 to prevent "ejected" or "safely removed" devices that are still
physically connected from immediately re-enumerating.

If the device was really unplugged, then error messages were printed
as the hub tries to set the U3 link state for a port that is no longer
enabled.

xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: Cannot set link state.
usb usb8-port1: cannot disable (err = -32)

Don't print error message in xhci-hub if hub tries to set port link state
for a disabled port. Return -ENODEV instead which also silences hub driver.
