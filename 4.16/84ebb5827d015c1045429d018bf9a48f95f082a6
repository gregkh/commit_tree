mm/slab.c: remove redundant assignments for slab_state

slab_state is being set to "UP" in create_kmalloc_caches(), and later on
we set it again in kmem_cache_init_late(), but slab_state does not
change in the meantime.

Remove the redundant assignment from kmem_cache_init_late().

And unless I overlooked anything, the same goes for "slab_state = FULL".
slab_state is set to "FULL" in kmem_cache_init_late(), but it is later
being set again in cpucache_init(), which gets called from
do_initcall_level().  So remove the assignment from cpucache_init() as
well.
