perf trace: No need to set PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER explicitely

Since 75562573bab3 ("perf tools: Add support for
PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER") we don't need explicitely set
PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER, as perf_evlist__config() will do this for us,
i.e. when there are more than one evsel in an evlist, it will check if
some evsel has a sample_type different than the one on the first evsel
in the list, setting PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER in that case.

So, to simplify 'perf trace' codebase, ditch that check.
