lib/test_kmod.c: fix limit check on number of test devices created

As reported by Dan the parentheses is in the wrong place, and since
unlikely() call returns either 0 or 1 it's never less than zero.  The
second issue is that signed integer overflows like "INT_MAX + 1" are
undefined behavior.

Since num_test_devs represents the number of devices, we want to stop
prior to hitting the max, and not rely on the wrap arround at all.  So
just cap at num_test_devs + 1, prior to assigning a new device.
