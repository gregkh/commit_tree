Btrfs: fix unexpected -EEXIST when creating new inode

The highest objectid, which is assigned to new inode, is decided at
the time of initializing fs roots.  However, in cases where log replay
gets processed, the btree which fs root owns might be changed, so we
have to search it again for the highest objectid, otherwise creating
new inode would end up with -EEXIST.
