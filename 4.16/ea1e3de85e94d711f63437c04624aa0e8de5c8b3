arm64: entry: Add fake CPU feature for unmapping the kernel at EL0

Allow explicit disabling of the entry trampoline on the kernel command
line (kpti=off) by adding a fake CPU feature (ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0)
that can be used to toggle the alternative sequences in our entry code and
avoid use of the trampoline altogether if desired. This also allows us to
make use of a static key in arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0().
