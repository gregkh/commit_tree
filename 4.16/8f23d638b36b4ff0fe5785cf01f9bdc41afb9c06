bnxt_en: Expand bnxt_check_rings() to check all resources.

bnxt_check_rings() is called by ethtool, XDP setup, and ndo_setup_tc()
to see if there are enough resources to support the new configuration.
Expand the call to test all resources if the firmware supports the new
API.  With the more flexible resource allocation scheme, this call must
be made to check that all resources are available before committing to
allocate the resources.
