thermal: armada: Add support for Armada AP806

The AP806 component is integrated in the Armada 8K and 7K lines of
processors.

The thermal sensor sample field on the status register is a signed
value. Extend armada_get_temp() and the driver structure to handle
signed values.

previous patches, including the register names changes, also switched

negative values and used do_div instead of the traditionnal '/']
