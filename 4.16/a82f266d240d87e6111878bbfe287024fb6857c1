net: phy: realtek: group all register bit #defines for RTL821x_INER

This simply moves all register bit #defines which describe the (PHY
specific) bits in the RTL821x_INER right below the RTL821x_INER register
definition. This makes it easier to spot which registers and bits belong
together.
No functional changes.
