powerpc/pci: Unroll two pass loop when scanning bridges

The current scanning code is really hard to understand because it calls the
same function in a loop where pass value is changed without any comments
explaining it:

  for (pass = 0; pass < 2; pass++)
    for_each_pci_bridge(dev, bus)
      max = pci_scan_bridge(bus, dev, max, pass);

Unfamiliar reader cannot tell easily what is the purpose of this loop
without looking at internals of pci_scan_bridge().

In order to make this bit easier to understand, open-code the loop in
pci_scan_child_bus() and pci_hp_add_bridge() with added comments.

No functional changes intended.
