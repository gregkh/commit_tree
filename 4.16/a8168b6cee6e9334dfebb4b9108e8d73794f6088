bnxt_en: Don't print "Link speed -1 no longer supported" messages.

On some dual port NICs, the 2 ports have to be configured with compatible
link speeds.  Under some conditions, a port's configured speed may no
longer be supported.  The firmware will send a message to the driver
when this happens.

Improve this logic that prints out the warning by only printing it if
we can determine the link speed that is no longer supported.  If the
speed is unknown or it is in autoneg mode, skip the warning message.
