ima: Use i_version only when filesystem supports it

i_version is only supported by a filesystem when the SB_I_VERSION
flag is set. This patch tests for the SB_I_VERSION flag before using
i_version. If we can't use i_version to detect a file change then we
must assume the file has changed in the last_writer path and remeasure
it.

On filesystems without i_version support IMA used to measure a file
only once and didn't detect any changes to a file. With this patch
IMA now works properly on these filesystems.
