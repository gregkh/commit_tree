clocksource/drivers/timer-of: Store the device node pointer in 'struct timer_of'

Under certain circumstances, some specific operations must be done with the
device node pointer, which forces the timer code to propagate the pointer to
the functions which need it.

In order to consolidate the function signatures in the different drivers
by using the timer-of structure, let's store it in the timer-of structure
as a handy pointer when it is needed.
