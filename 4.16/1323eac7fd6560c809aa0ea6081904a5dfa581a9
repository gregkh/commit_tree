ftrace/module: Move ftrace_release_mod() to ddebug_cleanup label

ftrace_module_init happen after dynamic_debug_setup, it is desired that
cleanup should be called after this label however in current implementation
it is called in free module label,ie:even though ftrace in not initialized,
from so many fail case ftrace_release_mod() will be called and unnecessary
traverse the whole list.
In below patch we moved ftrace_release_mod() from free_module label to
ddebug_cleanup label. that is the best possible location, other solution
is to make new label to ftrace_release_mod() but since ftrace_module_init()
is not return with minimum changes it should be in ddebug_cleanup label.
