KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Add missing irq_lock to vgic_mmio_read_pending

Our irq_is_pending() helper function accesses multiple members of the
vgic_irq struct, so we need to hold the lock when calling it.
Add that requirement as a comment to the definition and take the lock
around the call in vgic_mmio_read_pending(), where we were missing it
before.
