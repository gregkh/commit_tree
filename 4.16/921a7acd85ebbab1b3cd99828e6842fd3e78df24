tracing: Detect the string nul character when parsing user input string

User space can pass in a C nul character '\0' along with its input. The
function trace_get_user() will try to process it as a normal character,
and that will fail to parse.

open("/sys/kernel/debug/tracing//set_ftrace_pid", O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC) = 3
write(3, " \0", 2)                      = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

while parse can handle spaces, so below works.

$ echo "" > set_ftrace_pid
$ echo " " > set_ftrace_pid
$ echo -n " " > set_ftrace_pid

Have the parser stop on '\0' and cease any further parsing. Only process
the characters up to the nul '\0' character and do not process it.
