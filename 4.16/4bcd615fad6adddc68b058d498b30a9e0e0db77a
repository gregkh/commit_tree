watchdog: Fix potential kref imbalance when opening watchdog

If a watchdog driver's open function sets WDOG_HW_RUNNING with the
expectation that the watchdog can not be stopped, but then stops the
watchdog anyway in its stop function, kref_get() wil not be called in
watchdog_open(). If the watchdog then stops on close, WDOG_HW_RUNNING
will be cleared and kref_put() will be called, causing a kref imbalance.
As result the character device data structure will be released, which in
turn will cause the system to crash on the next call to watchdog_open().
