drm/debugfs: Fix framebuffer debugfs file init

The introduction of: drm/framebuffer: Add framebuffer debugfs file
broke vgem. That patch assumed that all drivers had initialized the
dev->mode_config.fb_lock mutex which happens in drm_mode_config_init().
vgem doesn't need to call drm_mode_config_init().

Fix this by only creating the framebuffer debugfs file for modesetting
drivers.
