rtlwifi: btcoex: Add wifi_only series ops to control solo card

Originally, btcoex controls the antenna of combo card, but solo card
is also needed to setup properly. The new ops are named with suffix
'_wifi_only' opposited to original btc_ops, and new structures and
definitions are also introduced. The wifi_only oly contains four ops that
are initial variable, hw config, scan notify, and switch band notify.
