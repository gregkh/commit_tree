SUNRPC: Don't call __UDPX_INC_STATS() from a preemptible context

Calling __UDPX_INC_STATS() from a preemptible context leads to a
warning of the form:

 BUG: using __this_cpu_add() in preemptible [00000000] code: kworker/u5:0/31
 caller is xs_udp_data_receive_workfn+0x194/0x270
 CPU: 1 PID: 31 Comm: kworker/u5:0 Not tainted 4.15.0-rc8-00076-g90ea9f1 #2

  ? __kthread_bind_mask+0x60/0x60
  ret_from_fork+0x24/0x30

Since we're taking a spinlock in those functions anyway, let's fix the
issue by moving the call so that it occurs under the spinlock.
