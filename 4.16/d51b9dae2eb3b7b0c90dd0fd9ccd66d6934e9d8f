Documentation/cgroup-v1: fix outdated programming details

The cgroup-v1 documentation is out of date in a few places:

 * cgroup controllers can no longer be compiled as modules since commit
   3ed80a6 ("cgroup: drop module support"); the functions and fields
   referenced here no longer exist.

 * Controllers need to create of a cgroup_subsys object named
   "<name>_cgrp_subsys" instead of "<name>_subsys" since commit
   073219e ("cgroup: clean up cgroup_subsys names and initialization")
