bpf: get rid of pure_initcall dependency to enable jits

Having a pure_initcall() callback just to permanently enable BPF
JITs under CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON is unnecessary and could leave
a small race window in future where JIT is still disabled on boot.
Since we know about the setting at compilation time anyway, just
initialize it properly there. Also consolidate all the individual
bpf_jit_enable variables into a single one and move them under one
location. Moreover, don't allow for setting unspecified garbage
values on them.
