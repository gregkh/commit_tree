bnxt_en: export a common switchdev PARENT_ID for all reps of an adapter

Currently the driver exports different switchdev PARENT_IDs for
representors belonging to different SR-IOV PF-pools of an adapter.
This is not correct as the adapter can switch across all vports
of an adapter. This patch fixes this by exporting a common switchdev
PARENT_ID for all reps of an adapter. The PCIE DSN is used as the id.
