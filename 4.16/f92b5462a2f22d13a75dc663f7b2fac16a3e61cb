firmware: arm_sdei: add support for CPU private events

Private SDE events are per-cpu, and need to be registered and enabled
on each CPU.

Hide this detail from the caller by adapting our {,un}register and
{en,dis}able calls to send an IPI to each CPU if the event is private.

CPU private events are unregistered when the CPU is powered-off, and
re-registered when the CPU is brought back online. This saves bringing
secondary cores back online to call private_reset() on shutdown, kexec
and resume from hibernate.
