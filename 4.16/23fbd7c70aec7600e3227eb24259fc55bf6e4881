acpi, nfit: fix register dimm error handling

A NULL pointer reference kernel bug was observed when
acpi_nfit_add_dimm() called in acpi_nfit_register_dimms() failed. This
error path does not set nfit_mem->nvdimm, but the 2nd
list_for_each_entry() loop in the function assumes it's always set. Add
a check to nfit_mem->nvdimm.
