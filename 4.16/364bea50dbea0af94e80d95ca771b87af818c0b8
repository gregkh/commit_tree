mt76: fix memcpy to potential null pointer on failed allocation

Currently if the allocation of skb fails and returns NULL then the
call to skb_put will cause a null pointer dereference. Fix this by
checking for a null skb and returning NULL.  Note that calls to
function mt76x2_mcu_msg_alloc don't directly check the null return
but instead pass the NULL pointer to mt76x2_mcu_msg_send which
checks for the NULL and returns ENOMEM in this case.
