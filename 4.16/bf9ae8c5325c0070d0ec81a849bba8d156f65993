blk-mq: fix bad clear of RQF_MQ_INFLIGHT in blk_mq_ct_ctx_init()

A previous commit moved the clearing of rq->rq_flags later,
but we may have already set RQF_MQ_INFLIGHT when that happens.
Ensure that we correctly initialize rq->rq_flags to the
right value.

This is based on an original fix by Ming, just rewritten to not
require a conditional.
