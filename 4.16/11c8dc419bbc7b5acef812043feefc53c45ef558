x86/jailhouse: Enable APIC and SMP support

Register the APIC which Jailhouse always exposes at 0xfee00000 if in
xAPIC mode or via MSRs as x2APIC. The latter is only available if it was
already activated because there is no support for switching its mode
during runtime.

Jailhouse requires the APIC to be operated in phys-flat mode. Ensure
that this mode is selected by Linux.

The available CPUs are taken from the setup data structure that the
loader filled and registered with the kernel.
