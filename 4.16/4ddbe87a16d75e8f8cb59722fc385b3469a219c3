drm/i915/guc: Add preemption action to GuC firmware interface

We're using GuC action to request preemption. However, after requesting
preemption we need to wait for GuC to finish its own post-processing
before we start submitting our requests. Firmware is using shared
context to report its status.
Let's update GuC firmware interface with those new definitions.

v2: Drop unused INTEL_GUC_PREEMPT_OPTION_IMMEDIATE
