drm/i915: Refactor common list iteration over GGTT vma

In quite a few places, we have a list iteration over the vma on an
object that only want to inspect GGTT vma. By construction, these are
placed at the start of the list, so we have copied that knowledge into
many callsites. Pull that knowledge back to i915_vma.h and provide a
for_each_ggtt_vma() to tidy up the code.

v2: Add a backreference from vma_create() to remind ourselves why we put
ggtt vma at the head of the obj->vma_list (and ppgtt vma at the tail).
v3: Fixup s/vma/V/
