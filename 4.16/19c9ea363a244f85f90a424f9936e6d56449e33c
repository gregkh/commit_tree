r8169: fix setting driver_data after register_netdev

pci_set_drvdata() is called only after registering the net_device,
therefore we could run into a NPE if one of the functions using
driver_data is called before it's set.

Fix this by calling pci_set_drvdata() before registering the
net_device.

This fix is a candidate for stable. As far as I can see the
bug has been there in kernel version 3.2 already, therefore
I can't provide a reference which commit is fixed by it.

The fix may need small adjustments per kernel version because
due to other changes the label which is jumped to if
register_netdev() fails has changed over time.
