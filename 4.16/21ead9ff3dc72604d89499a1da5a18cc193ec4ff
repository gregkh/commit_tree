SUNRPC: Micro-optimize __rpc_execute

The common case: There are 13 to 14 actions per RPC, and tk_callback
is non-NULL in only one of them. There's no need to store a NULL in
the tk_callback field during each FSM step.

This slightly improves throughput results in dbench and other multi-
threaded benchmarks on my two-socket client on 56Gb InfiniBand, but
will probably be inconsequential on slower systems.
