mac80211: Add TXQ scheduling API

This adds an API to mac80211 to handle scheduling of TXQs and changes the
interface between driver and mac80211 for TXQ handling as follows:

- The wake_tx_queue callback interface no longer includes the TXQ. Instead,
  the driver is expected to retrieve that from ieee80211_next_txq()

- Two new mac80211 functions are added: ieee80211_next_txq() and
  ieee80211_schedule_txq(). The former returns the next TXQ that should be
  scheduled, and is how the driver gets a queue to pull packets from. The
  latter is called internally by mac80211 to start scheduling a queue, and
  the driver is supposed to call it to re-schedule the TXQ after it is
  finished pulling packets from it (unless the queue emptied).

The ath9k and ath10k drivers are changed to use the new API.
