s390/qeth: fix IP removal on offline cards

If the HW is not reachable, then none of the IPs in qeth's internal
table has been registered with the HW yet. So when deleting such an IP,
there's no need to stage it for deregistration - just drop it from
the table.

This fixes the "add-delete-add" scenario on an offline card, where the
the second "add" merely increments the IP's use count. But as the IP is
still set to DISP_ADDR_DELETE from the previous "delete" step,
l3_recover_ip() won't register it with the HW when the card goes online.
