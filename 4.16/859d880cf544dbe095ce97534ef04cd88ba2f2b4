signal: Correct the offset of si_pkey in struct siginfo

The change moving addr_lsb into the _sigfault union failed to take
into account that _sigfault._addr_bnd._lower being a pointer forced
the entire union to have pointer alignment.  In practice this only
mattered for the offset of si_pkey which is why this has taken so long
to discover.

To correct this change _dummy_pkey and _dummy_bnd to have pointer type.
