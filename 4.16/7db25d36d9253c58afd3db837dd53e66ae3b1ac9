ovl: verify whiteout index entries on mount

Whiteout index entries are used as an indication that an exported
overlay file handle should be treated as stale (i.e. after unlink
of the overlay inode).

Check on mount that whiteout index entries have a name that looks like
a valid file handle and cleanup invalid index entries.

For whiteout index entries, do not check that they also have valid
origin fh and nlink xattr, because those xattr do not exist for a
whiteout index entry.
