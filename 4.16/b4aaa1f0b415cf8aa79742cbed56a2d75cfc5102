IB/mlx5: Handle type IB_QPT_DRIVER when creating a QP

The QP type IB_QPT_DRIVER doesn't describe the transport or the service
that the QP provides but those are known only to the hardware driver.
The actual type of the QP is stored in the hardware driver context (i.e.
mlx5_qp) under the field qp_sub_type.

Take the real QP type and any extra data that is required to create the QP
from the driver channel and modify the QP initial attributes before continuing
with create_qp().

Downstream patches from this series will add support for both DCI and
DCT driver QPs.
