clk: si5351: Apply PLL soft reset before enabling the outputs

The "Si5351A/B/C Data Sheet" states to apply a PLL soft reset before
enabling the output clocks [1]. This is required to get a deterministic
phase relationship between the output clocks.

Without resetting the PLL, the phase relationship between the clocks is
unpredictable. Fix this by resetting the PLL in si5351_clkout_prepare().
