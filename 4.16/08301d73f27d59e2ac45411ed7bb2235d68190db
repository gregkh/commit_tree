drm/etnaviv: move ww_acquire_ctx out of submit object

The acquire_ctx is special in that it needs to be released from the same
thread as has been used to initialize it. This collides with the intention to
extend the submit lifetime beyond the gem_submit function with potentially
other threads doing the final cleanup.

Move the ww_acquire_ctx to the function local stack as suggested in the
documentation.
