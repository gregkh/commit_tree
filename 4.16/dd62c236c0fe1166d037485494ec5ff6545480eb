ravb: Remove obsolete explicit clock handling for WoL

Currently, if Wake-on-LAN is enabled, the EtherAVB device's module clock
is manually kept running during system suspend, to make sure the device
stays active.

Since commit 91c719f5ec6671f7 ("soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: Keep wakeup
sources active during system suspend") , this workaround is no longer
needed.  Hence remove all explicit clock handling to keep the device
active.
