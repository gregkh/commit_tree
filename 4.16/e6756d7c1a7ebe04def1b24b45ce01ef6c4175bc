drm/msm: fix msm_rd_dump_submit prototype

The prototype of msm_rd_dump_submit() has recently changed. However,
we have two declarations of this functions, and the other one
remains the old version, leading to this:

drivers/gpu/drm/msm/msm_gpu.c: In function 'recover_worker':
drivers/gpu/drm/msm/msm_gpu.c:295:23: error: passing argument 1 of 'msm_rd_dump_submit' from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]

This changes the second one to match the first again.
