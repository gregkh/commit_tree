staging: unisys: add SPDX identifiers to all unisys driver files

It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.

Update the drivers/staging/unisys files files with the correct SPDX
license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.  The
SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
instead of the full boiler plate text.

This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.
