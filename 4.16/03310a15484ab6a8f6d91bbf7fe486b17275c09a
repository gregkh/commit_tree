USB: ledtrig-usbport: fix of-node leak

This code looks up a USB device node from a given parent USB device but
never dropped its reference to the returned node.

As only the address of the node is used for a later matching, the
reference can be dropped immediately.

Note that this trigger implementation confuses the description of the
USB device connected to a port with the port itself (which does not have
a device-tree representation).
