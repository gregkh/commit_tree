serial: 8250_of: fix return code when probe function fails to get reset

The error pointer from devm_reset_control_get_optional_shared() is
not propagated.

One of the most common problem scenarios is it returns -EPROBE_DEFER
when the reset controller has not probed yet.  In this case, the
probe of the reset consumer should be deferred.
