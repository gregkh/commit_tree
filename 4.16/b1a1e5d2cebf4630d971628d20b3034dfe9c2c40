drm/i915/selftests: Reduce the volume of the timeout message

Originally it was anticipated that timeouts would be a rare event, and
so merit a warning that the test was incomplete. However, for igt we
keep the timeout low, and hitting the timeout is intentional. It no
longer necessitates a warning, but to be expected.
