xdp/qede: setup xdp_rxq_info and intro xdp_rxq_info_is_reg

The driver code qede_free_fp_array() depend on kfree() can be called
with a NULL pointer. This stems from the qede_alloc_fp_array()
function which either (kz)alloc memory for fp->txq or fp->rxq.
This also simplifies error handling code in case of memory allocation
failures, but xdp_rxq_info_unreg need to know the difference.

Introduce xdp_rxq_info_is_reg() to handle if a memory allocation fails
and detect this is the failure path by seeing that xdp_rxq_info was
not registred yet, which first happens after successful alloaction in
qede_init_fp().

Driver hook points for xdp_rxq_info:
 * reg  : qede_init_fp
 * unreg: qede_free_fp_array

Tested on actual hardware with samples/bpf program.

V2: Driver have no proper error path for failed XDP RX-queue info reg, as
qede_init_fp() is a void function.
