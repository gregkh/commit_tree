selftests/powerpc: Fix to use ucontext_t instead of struct ucontext

With glibc 2.26 'struct ucontext' is removed to improve POSIX
compliance, which breaks powerpc/alignment_handler selftest. Fix the
test by using ucontext_t. Tested on ppc, works with older glibc
versions as well.

Fixes the following:
  alignment_handler.c: In function ‘sighandler’:
  alignment_handler.c:68:5: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type ‘struct ucontext’
    ucp->uc_mcontext.gp_regs[PT_NIP] += 4;
