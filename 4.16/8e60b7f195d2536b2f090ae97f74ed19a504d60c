drm/i915/gvt: fix off-by-one comparison of ring_id

The ring_id maximum boundary is being compared using the > operator
instead of >=, leading to an off-by-one error and an out of bounds
write into array vgpu->hws_pga[].  Fix this by simply using the
correct comparison operator. Also re-work another comparison that
uses the comparison > I915_NUM_ENGINES - 1 to use the >= idiom using
to keep this consistent in this code.
