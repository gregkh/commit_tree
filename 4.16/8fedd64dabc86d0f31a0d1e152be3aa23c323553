drm/i915: Fix vblank timestamp/frame counter jumps on gen2

Previously I was under the impression that the scanline counter
reads 0 when the pipe is off. Turns out that's not correct, and
instead the scanline counter simply stops when the pipe stops, and
it retains it's last value until the pipe starts up again, at which
point the scanline counter jumps to vblank start.

These jumps can cause the timestamp to jump backwards by one frame.
Since we use the timestamps to guesstimage also the frame counter
value on gen2, that would cause the frame counter to also jump
backwards, which leads to a massice difference from the previous value.
The end result is that flips/vblank events don't appear to complete as
they're stuck waiting for the frame counter to catch up to that massive
difference.

Fix the problem properly by actually making sure the scanline counter
has started to move before we assume that it's safe to enable vblank
processing.
