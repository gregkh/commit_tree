ARM: 8726/1: B15: Add CPU hotplug awareness

The Broadcom Brahma-B15 readahead cache needs to be disabled,
respectively re-enable during a CPU hotplug. In case we were not to do,
CPU hotplug would occasionally fail with random crashes when a given CPU
exits the coherency domain while the RAC is still enabled, as it would
get stale data from the RAC.

In order to avoid adding any specific B15 readahead-cache awareness to
arch/arm/mach-bcm/hotplug-brcmstb.c we use a CPU hotplug state machine
which allows us to catch CPU hotplug events and disable/flush enable the
RAC accordingly.
