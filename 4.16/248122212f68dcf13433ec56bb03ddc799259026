net: mvpp2: use device_*/fwnode_* APIs instead of of_*

OF functions can be used only for the driver using DT.
As a preparation for introducing ACPI support in mvpp2
driver, use struct fwnode_handle in order to obtain
properties from the hardware description.

This patch replaces of_* function with device_*/fwnode_*
where possible in the mvpp2.
