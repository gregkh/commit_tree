xfs: only grab shared inode locks for source file during reflink

Reflink and dedupe operations remap blocks from a source file into a
destination file.  The destination file needs exclusive locks on all
levels because we're updating its block map, but the source file isn't
undergoing any block map changes so we can use a shared lock.
