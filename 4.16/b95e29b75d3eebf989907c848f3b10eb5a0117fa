scsi: lpfc: Fix receive PRLI handling

Handling a rcv'ed PRLI incorrectly can cause the ndlp to end up in the
wrong state or the driver to ACC and PRLI when it should send LS_RJT.

The cause was due to the driver not properly looking at the PRLI type
and taking the multiple protocol support into consideration.

Resolved by adding checks in the various PRLI receive points to validate
PRLI type and reject if not valid for the enabled protocols and mode
(host vs target).
