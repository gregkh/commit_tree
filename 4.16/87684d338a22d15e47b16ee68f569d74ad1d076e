ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Re-order some code to silence a warning

I get a Smatch warning here:

    sound/soc/intel/skylake/skl-nhlt.c:335 skl_get_ssp_clks()
    error: testing array offset 'j' after use.

The code is harmless, but the checker is right that we should swap these
two conditions so we verify that the offset is within bounds before we
use it.
