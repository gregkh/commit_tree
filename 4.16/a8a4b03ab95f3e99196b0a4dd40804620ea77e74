powerpc: Hard wire PT_SOFTE value to 1 in ptrace & signals

We have always had softe in pt_regs, and accessible via PT_SOFTE, even
though it is not userspace state.

The value userspace sees should always be 1, because we should never
be in userspace with interrupts soft disabled.

In a subsequent patch we will be changing the semantics of the kernel
softe value, so hard wire the value to 1 to retain the existing
semantics. As far as we know nothing ever looks at it, but better safe
than sorry.
