btrfs: make btrfs_free_stale_device() to iterate all stales

Let the list iterator iterate further and find other stale
devices and delete it. This is in preparation to add support
for user land request-able stale devices cleanup. Also rename
btrfs_free_stale_device() to btrfs_free_stale_devices().
