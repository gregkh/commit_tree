phy: exynos5-usbdrd: Calibrate LOS levels for exynos5420/5800

Adding phy calibration sequence for USB 3.0 DRD PHY present on
Exynos5420/5800 systems.
This calibration facilitates setting certain PHY parameters viz.
the Loss-of-Signal (LOS) Detector Threshold Level, as well as
Tx-Vboost-Level for Super-Speed operations.
Additionally we also set proper time to wait for RxDetect measurement,
for desired PHY reference clock, so as to solve issue with enumeration
of few USB 3.0 devices, like Samsung SUM-TSB16S 3.0 USB drive
on the controller.

We are using CR_port for this purpose to send required data
to override the LOS values.

On testing with USB 3.0 devices on USB 3.0 port present on
SMDK5420, and peach-pit boards should see following message:
usb 2-1: new SuperSpeed USB device number 2 using xhci-hcd

and without this patch, should see below shown message:
usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using xhci-hcd

[Also removed unnecessary extra lines in the register macro definitions]
