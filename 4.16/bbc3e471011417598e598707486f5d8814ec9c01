userns: Don't fail follow_automount based on s_user_ns

When vfs_submount was added the test to limit automounts from
filesystems that with s_user_ns != &init_user_ns accidentially left
in follow_automount.  The test was never about any security concerns
and was always about how do we implement this for filesystems whose
s_user_ns != &init_user_ns.

At the moment this check makes no difference as there are no
filesystems that both set FS_USERNS_MOUNT and implement d_automount.

Remove this check now while I am thinking about it so there will not
be odd booby traps for someone who does want to make this combination
work.

vfs_submount still needs improvements to allow this combination to work,
and vfs_submount contains a check that presents a warning.

The autofs4 filesystem could be modified to set FS_USERNS_MOUNT and it would
need not work on this code path, as userspace performs the mounts.
