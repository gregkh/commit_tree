drm/i915: Silence compiler for csr_load_work_fn()

gcc-4.7 is not very smart and can not tell that "si" is guarded by size
being 0. So it complains,

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_csr.c: In function ‘csr_load_work_fn’:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_csr.c:204:3: warning: ‘si’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_csr.c:190:30: note: ‘si’ was declared in

Give in and mark si as NULL.
