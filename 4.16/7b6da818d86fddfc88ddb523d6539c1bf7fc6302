drm/i915: Restore the kernel context after a GPU reset on an idle engine

As part of the system requirement for powersaving is that we always have
a context loaded. Upon boot and resume, we load the kernel_context to
ensure that some valid state is set before powersaving kicks in, we
should do so after a full GPU reset as well. We only need to do so for
an idle engine, as any active engines will restart by executing the
stuck request, loading its context. For the idle engine, we create a
new request to load the kernel_context instead.

For whatever reason, perfoming a dummy execute on the idle engine after
reset papers over a subsequent GPU hang in rare circumstances, even on
machines not using contexts (e.g. Pineview).
