ipv6: Prepare to handle multiple netdev events

To make IPv6 more in line with IPv4 we need to be able to respond
differently to different netdev events. For example, when a netdev is
unregistered all the routes using it as their nexthop device should be
flushed, whereas when the netdev's carrier changes only the 'linkdown'
flag should be toggled.

Currently, this is not possible, as the function that traverses the
routing tables is not aware of the triggering event.

Propagate the triggering event down, so that it could be used in later
patches.
