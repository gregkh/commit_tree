x86/hyperv: Redirect reenlightment notifications on CPU offlining

It is very unlikely for CPUs to get offlined when running on Hyper-V as
there is a protection in the vmbus module which prevents it when the guest
has any VMBus devices assigned. This, however, may change in future if an
option to reassign an already active channel will be added. It is also
possible to run without any Hyper-V devices or to have a CPU with no
assigned channels.

Reassign reenlightenment notifications to some other active CPU when the
CPU which is assigned to them goes offline.
