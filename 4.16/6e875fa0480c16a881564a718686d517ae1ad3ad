ACPICA: Debugger: fix slight indentation issue

ACPICA commit c75af007d35c0afe8791ac39b7749c7442f49912

The %*s format specifier prints a string with a width indicated by an integer.

In the case of acpi_os_printf() ("%*s", acpi_gbl_nesting_level, " "),
a single space is printed to the console when acpi_gbl_nesting_level
is 0 or 1. This change increments acpi_gbl_nesting_level so that there
is one space printed when acpi_gbl_nesting_level is 0 and two spaces
printed when acpi_gbl_nesting_level is 1.
