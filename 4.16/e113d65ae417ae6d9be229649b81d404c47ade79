media: tegra-cec: reset rx_buf_cnt when start bit detected

If a start bit is detected, then reset the receive buffer counter to 0.

This ensures that no stale data is in the buffer if a message is
broken off midstream due to e.g. a Low Drive condition and then
retransmitted.

The only Rx interrupts we need to listen to are RX_REGISTER_FULL (i.e.
a valid byte was received) and RX_START_BIT_DETECTED (i.e. a new
message starts and we need to reset the counter).
