drm/edid: quirk Windows Mixed Reality headsets as non-desktop

This uses the EDID info from Lenovo Explorer (LEN-b800), Acer AH100
(ACR-7fce), and Samsung Odyssey (SEC-144a) to mark them as non-desktop.

The other entries are for the HP Windows Mixed Reality Headset (HPN-3515),
the Fujitsu Windows Mixed Reality headset (FUJ-1970), the Dell Visor
(DEL-7fce), and the ASUS HC102 (AUS-c102). They are not tested with real
hardware, but listed as HMD monitors alongside the tested headsets in the
Microsoft HololensSensors driver package.
