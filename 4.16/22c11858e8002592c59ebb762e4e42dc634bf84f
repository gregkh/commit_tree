dm: introduce DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED

If dm_table_determine_type() establishes DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED then
all devices in the DM table do not support partial completions.  Also,
the table has a single immutable target that doesn't require DM core to
split bios.

This will enable adding NVMe optimizations to bio-based DM.
