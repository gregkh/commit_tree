staging: fsl-mc: Remove unnecessary dependency

The function that enables fsl-mc msi interrupts doesn't need
to be explicitly called from the fsl-mc bus driver initialization
routine.

Mark it to be independently called at system init; this is in line
with how things are handled by other GICv3 irqchip users.

Due to this change we now have an unused cleanup function, so
remove it.
