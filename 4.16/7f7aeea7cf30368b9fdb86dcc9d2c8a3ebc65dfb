staging: rts5208: Fix "seg_no" calculation in reset_ms_card()

I get some static checker warnings like this:

    drivers/staging/rts5208/ms.c:2607 ms_build_l2p_tbl()
    error: buffer underflow 'ms_card->segment' (-1)-16

The problem is that we memset "ms_card" to zero at the start of the
reset_ms_card() function.  That means that when we try to calculate
"ms_card->total_block / 512 - 1" then it's just always -1.  The fix is
to calculate "seg_no" before doing the memset().

This is a static checker fix, and I am not able to test it.  My theory
is that reset_ms_card() gets very little testing which is why this bug
exists.
