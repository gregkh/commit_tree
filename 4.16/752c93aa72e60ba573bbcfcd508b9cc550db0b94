ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Ensure dai and dailink registration happens in sequence.

Platform registration happens in probe work handler whereas machine
device is registered during skl_probe. This sometimes results in cpu
dais not found if the work handler is sufficiently delayed due to system
load, even with deferred probe of machine driver.

So move machine device registration after registering platform.
