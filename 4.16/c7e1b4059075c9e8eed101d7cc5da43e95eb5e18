tty: serial: exar: Relocate sleep wake-up handling

Exar sleep wake-up handling has been done on a per-channel basis by
virtue of INT0 being accessible from each channel's address space. I
believe this was initially done out of necessity, but now that Exar
devices have their own driver, we can do things more efficiently by
registering a dedicated INT0 handler at the PCI device level.

I see this change providing the following benefits:

    1. If more than one port is active, eliminates the redundant bus
       cycles for reading INT0 on every interrupt.
    2. This note associated with hooking in the per-channel handler in
       8250_port.c is resolved:
        /* Fixme: probably not the best place for this */
