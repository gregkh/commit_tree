powerpc/pseries: Enable RAS hotplug events later

Currently if the kernel receives a memory hot-unplug event early
enough, it may get stuck in an infinite loop in
dissolve_free_huge_pages(). This appears as a stall just after:

  pseries-hotplug-mem: Attempting to hot-remove XX LMB(s) at YYYYYYYY

It appears to be caused by "minimum_order" being uninitialized, due to
init_ras_IRQ() executing before hugetlb_init().

To correct this, extract the part of init_ras_IRQ() that enables
hotplug event processing and place it in the machine_late_initcall
phase, which is guaranteed to be after hugetlb_init() is called.
