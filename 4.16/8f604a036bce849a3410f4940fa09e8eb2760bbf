scsi: bfa: use proper time accessor for stats_reset_time

We use the deprecated do_gettimeofday() function to read the current
time when resetting the statistics in both bfa_port and bfa_svc. This
works fine because overflow is handled correctly, but we want to get rid
of do_gettimeofday() and using a non-monotonic time suffers from
concurrent settimeofday calls and other problems.

This uses the ktime_get_seconds() function instead, which does what we
need here.
