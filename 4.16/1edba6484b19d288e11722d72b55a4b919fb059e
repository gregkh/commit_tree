media: rc: Replace timeval with ktime_t in imon.c

This patch changes the 32-bit time type (timeval) to the 64-bit one
(ktime_t), since 32-bit time types will break in the year 2038.

I use ktime_t instead of all uses of timeval in imon.c

This patch also changes do_gettimeofday() to ktime_get() accordingly,
since ktime_get returns a ktime_t, but do_gettimeofday returns a
struct timeval, and the other reason is that ktime_get() uses
the monotonic clock.
