mtd: nand: sunxi: Fix ECC strength choice

When the requested ECC strength does not exactly match the strengths
supported by the ECC engine, the driver is selecting the closest
strength meeting the 'selected_strength > requested_strength'
constraint. Fix the fact that, in this particular case, ecc->strength
value was not updated to match the 'selected_strength'.

For instance, one can encounter this issue when no ECC requirement is
filled in the device tree while the NAND chip minimum requirement is not
a strength/step_size combo natively supported by the ECC engine.
