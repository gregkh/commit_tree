crypto: hash - introduce crypto_hash_alg_has_setkey()

Templates that use an shash spawn can use crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()
to determine whether the underlying algorithm requires a key or not.
But there was no corresponding function for ahash spawns.  Add it.

Note that the new function actually has to support both shash and ahash
algorithms, since the ahash API can be used with either.
