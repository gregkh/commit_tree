arm64: handle 52-bit addresses in TTBR

The top 4 bits of a 52-bit physical address are positioned at bits 2..5
in the TTBR registers. Introduce a couple of macros to move the bits
there, and change all TTBR writers to use them.

Leave TTBR0 PAN code unchanged, to avoid complicating it. A system with
52-bit PA will have PAN anyway (because it's ARMv8.1 or later), and a
system without 52-bit PA can only use up to 48-bit PAs. A later patch in
this series will add a kconfig dependency to ensure PAN is configured.

In addition, when using 52-bit PA there is a special alignment
requirement on the top-level table. We don't currently have any VA_BITS
configuration that would violate the requirement, but one could be added
in the future, so add a compile-time BUG_ON to check for it.
