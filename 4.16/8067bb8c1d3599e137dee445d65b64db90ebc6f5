ipv6: Ignore dead routes during lookup

Currently, dead routes are only present in the routing tables in case
the 'ignore_routes_with_linkdown' sysctl is set. Otherwise, they are
flushed.

Subsequent patches are going to remove the reliance on this sysctl and
make IPv6 more consistent with IPv4.

Before this is done, we need to make sure dead routes are skipped during
route lookup, so as to not cause packet loss.
