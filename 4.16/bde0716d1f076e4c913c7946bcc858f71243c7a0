xhci: workaround for AMD Promontory disabled ports wakeup

For AMD Promontory xHCI host, although you can disable USB ports in
BIOS settings, those ports will be enabled anyway after you remove a
device on that port and re-plug it in again. It's a known limitation of
the chip. As a workaround we can clear the PORT_WAKE_BITS.
