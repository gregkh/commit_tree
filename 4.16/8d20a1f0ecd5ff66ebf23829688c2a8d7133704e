RDMA/cma: Fix rdma_cm raw IB path setting for RoCE

rdma_set_ib_path() missed setting path record fields for RoCE
transport when RoCE support was added.

This results in setting incorrect ndev, destination mac address,
incorrect GID type etc errors when user space attempts to set a raw
IB path using the roce IB path compatibility mapping from userspace.
