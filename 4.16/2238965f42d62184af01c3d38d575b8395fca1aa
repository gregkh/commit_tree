staging: dgnc: remove PCI_DEVICE_NEO stuff

The "Neo" devices are never allowed to be bound to this driver, as they
are not in the valid list of PCI ids, so delete them from the driver as
the code in the probe function has no way to ever run.

Also delete the defines that are no longer used in relation to the Neo
devices, as they are not needed anymore.
