scripts: kernel-doc: apply filtering rules to warnings

When kernel-doc is called with output selection filters,
it will be called lots of time for a single file. If
there is a warning present there, it means that it may
print hundreds of identical warnings.

Worse than that, the -function NAME actually filters only
functions. So, it makes no sense at all to print warnings
for structs or enums.
