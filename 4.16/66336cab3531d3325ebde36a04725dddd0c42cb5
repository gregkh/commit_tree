KVM: x86: add support for emulating UMIP

The User-Mode Instruction Prevention feature present in recent Intel
processor prevents a group of instructions (sgdt, sidt, sldt, smsw, and
str) from being executed with CPL > 0. Otherwise, a general protection
fault is issued.

UMIP instructions in general are also able to trigger vmexits, so we can
actually emulate UMIP on older processors.  This commit sets up the
infrastructure so that kvm-intel.ko and kvm-amd.ko can set the UMIP
feature bit for CPUID even if the feature is not actually available
in hardware.
