drm/i915/cnl: Simplify dco_fraction calculation.

I confess I never fully understood that previous calculation,
so this is not a "fix". But let's simplify this math
so poor brains like mine can read and make some sense of
it in the future.

v2: Don't follow the spec since that gives invalid
    values and it is also confusing. This Ville's
    version is much simpler.
v3: Use u64 cast instead of declaring a u64 dco. (Ville).
