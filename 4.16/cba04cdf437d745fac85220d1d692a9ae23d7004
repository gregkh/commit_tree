Input: stmfts - set IRQ_NOAUTOEN to the irq flag

The interrupt is requested before the device is powered on and
it's value in some cases cannot be reliable. It happens on some
devices that an interrupt is generated as soon as requested
before having the chance to disable the irq.

Set the irq flag as IRQ_NOAUTOEN before requesting it.

This patch mutes the error:

  stmfts 2-0049: failed to read events: -11

received sometimes during boot time.
