KVM: x86: don't forget vcpu_put() in kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_sregs()

Due to a bad merge resolution between commit f29810335965 ("KVM/x86:
Check input paging mode when cs.l is set") and commit b4ef9d4e8cb8
("KVM: Move vcpu_load to arch-specific kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_sregs"),
there is a case in kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_sregs() where vcpu_put() is
not called after vcpu_get().  Fix it.
