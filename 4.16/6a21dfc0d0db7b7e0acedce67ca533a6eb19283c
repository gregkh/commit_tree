RDMA/ucma: Limit possible option size

Users of ucma are supposed to provide size of option level,
in most paths it is supposed to be equal to u8 or u16, but
it is not the case for the IB path record, where it can be
multiple of struct ib_path_rec_data.

This patch takes simplest possible approach and prevents providing
values more than possible to allocate.
