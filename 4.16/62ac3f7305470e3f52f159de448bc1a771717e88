libata: Apply NOLPM quirk to Crucial M500 480 and 960GB SSDs

There have been reports of the Crucial M500 480GB model not working
with LPM set to min_power / med_power_with_dipm level.

It has not been tested with medium_power, but that typically has no
measurable power-savings.

Note the reporters Crucial_CT480M500SSD3 has a firmware version of MU03
and there is a MU05 update available, but that update does not mention any
LPM fixes in its changelog, so the quirk matches all firmware versions.

In my experience the LPM problems with (older) Crucial SSDs seem to be
limited to higher capacity versions of the SSDs (different firmware?),
so this commit adds a NOLPM quirk for the 480 and 960GB versions of the
M500, to avoid LPM causing issues with these SSDs.
