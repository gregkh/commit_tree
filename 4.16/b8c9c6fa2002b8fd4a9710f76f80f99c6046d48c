ARM: dts: dra7: Disable USB metastability workaround for USB2

The metastability workaround causes Erratic errors [1]
on the HighSpeed USB PHY which can cause upto 2 seconds
delay in enumerating to a USB host while in Gadget mode.

Disable the Run/Stop metastability workaround to avoid this
ill effect. We are aware that this opens up the opportunity
for Run/Stop metastability, however this issue has never been
observed in TI releases so we think that Run/Stop metastability
is a lesser evil than the PHY Erratic errors. So disable it.
