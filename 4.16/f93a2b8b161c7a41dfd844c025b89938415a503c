staging: rtl8192u: remove redundant initialization of 'timeout'

Variable timeout is initialized however this value is never read and
it is reassigned a new value a little later, hence the initialization
is redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/staging/rtl8192u/ieee80211/ieee80211_softmac.c:1728:6: warning:
Value stored to 'timeout' during its initialization is never read
