drm/i915: Mark vm_free_page() as a potential sleeper agent

vm_free_page() may call down into set_pages_array_wb() (which itself
sleeps, on x86 at least) but only if on !llc and the caches overflow.
Since this is unlikely, we only rarely trigger the error in practice,
and so to make CI detection of this sleeping bug possible we want to
mark the common vm_free_page() as a potential sleep.
