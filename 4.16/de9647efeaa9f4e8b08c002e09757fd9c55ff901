platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode switch on 2-in-1's

Some laptops such as the XPS 9360 support the intel-vbtn INT33D6
interface but don't initialize the bit that intel-vbtn uses to
represent switching tablet mode.

By running this only on real 2-in-1's it shouldn't cause false
positives.
