drm/tinydrm: Use drm_fb_cma_fbdev_init_with_funcs/fini()

Use drm_fb_cma_fbdev_init_with_funcs() and drm_fb_cma_fbdev_fini() which
relies on the fact that drm_device holds a pointer to the drm_fb_helper
structure. This means that the driver doesn't have to keep track of that.
Also use the drm_fb_helper functions directly.
Remove todo entry.
