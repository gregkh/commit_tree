target core: add device action configfs files

This patch adds a new group of files that are to be used to
have the kernel module execution some action. The next patch
will have target_core_user use the group/files to be able to block
a device and to reset its memory buffer used to pass commands
between user/kernel space.

This type of file is different from the existing device attributes
in that they may be write only and when written to they result in
the kernel module executing some function. These need to be
separate from the normal device attributes which get/set device
values so userspace can continue to loop over all the attribs and
get/set them during initialization.
