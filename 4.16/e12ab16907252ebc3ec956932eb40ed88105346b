drm/i915/guc: Add a second client, to be used for preemption

This second client is created with priority KMD_HIGH, and marked
as preemptive. This will allow us to request preemption using GuC actions.

v2: Extract clients creation into a helper, debugfs fixups. (Michał)
Recreate doorbell on init. (Daniele)
Move clients into an array.

v3: And move clients back from an array, to get rid of the enum (Michał)

v4: Use is_high_priority, move DRM_ERROR into __create_doorbell, move
GEM_BUG_ON inside guc_clients_create (Michał)

v5: Split the BUG_ON (Michał)

v6: Cleanup after error during doorbell reinit (Michał)
