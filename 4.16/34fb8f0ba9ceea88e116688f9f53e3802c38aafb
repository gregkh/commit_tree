PM / core: Use dev_pm_skip_next_resume_phases() internally

Make the PM core call dev_pm_skip_next_resume_phases() to skip the
"early resume" and "resume" phases of system-wide transitions to the
working state for a given device instead of clearing the relevant
status bits for it directly.

No intentional changes in functionality.
