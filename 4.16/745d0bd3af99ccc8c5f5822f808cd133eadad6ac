e1000e: Remove Other from EIAC

It was reported that emulated e1000e devices in vmware esxi 6.5 Build
7526125 do not link up after commit 4aea7a5c5e94 ("e1000e: Avoid receiver
overrun interrupt bursts", v4.15-rc1). Some tracing shows that after
e1000e_trigger_lsc() is called, ICR reads out as 0x0 in e1000_msix_other()
on emulated e1000e devices. In comparison, on real e1000e 82574 hardware,
icr=0x80000004 (_INT_ASSERTED | _LSC) in the same situation.

Some experimentation showed that this flaw in vmware e1000e emulation can
be worked around by not setting Other in EIAC. This is how it was before
16ecba59bc33 ("e1000e: Do not read ICR in Other interrupt", v4.5-rc1).
