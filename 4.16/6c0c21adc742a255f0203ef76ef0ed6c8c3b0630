usercopy: Mark kmalloc caches as usercopy caches

Mark the kmalloc slab caches as entirely whitelisted. These caches
are frequently used to fulfill kernel allocations that contain data
to be copied to/from userspace. Internal-only uses are also common,
but are scattered in the kernel. For now, mark all the kmalloc caches
as whitelisted.

This patch is modified from Brad Spengler/PaX Team's PAX_USERCOPY
whitelisting code in the last public patch of grsecurity/PaX based on my
understanding of the code. Changes or omissions from the original code are
mine and don't reflect the original grsecurity/PaX code.
