media: lirc: lirc daemon fails to detect raw IR device

Since commit 9b6192589be7 ("media: lirc: implement scancode sending"),
and commit de142c324106 ("media: lirc: implement reading scancode")
the lirc features ioctl for raw IR devices advertises two modes for
sending and receiving.

The lirc daemon now fails to detect a raw IR device, both for transmit
and receive.

To fix this, do not advertise the scancode mode in the lirc features
for raw IR devices (however do keep it for scancode devices). The mode
can still be used via the LIRC_SET_{REC,SEND}_MODE ioctl.
