drm/i915: Skip an engine reset if it recovered before our preparations

At the beginning of a reset, we disable the submission method and find
the stuck request. We expect to find a stuck request for we have
declared the engine stalled. However, if we find no active request, the
engine must have recovered from its stall before we could issue a reset,
so let the engine continue on without a reset. If the engine is truly
stuck, we will back soon enough with the next reset attempt.

v2: Remove the stale debug message.
