IB/cq: Don't force IB_POLL_DIRECT poll context for ib_process_cq_direct

polling the completion queue directly does not interfere
with the existing polling logic, hence drop the requirement.
Be aware that running ib_process_cq_direct with non IB_POLL_DIRECT
CQ may trigger concurrent CQ processing.

This can be used for polling mode ULPs.
