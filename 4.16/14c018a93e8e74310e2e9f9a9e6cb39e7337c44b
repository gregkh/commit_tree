staging: most: core: remove function get_channel_by_iface

This patch removes the function get_channel_by_iface that walks a list of
all registered interfaces and returns a pointer to a channel when matched.
Instead the private field of the interface structure is used to directly
access the channel via the id. The patch is needed to remove unnecessary
list traversing.
