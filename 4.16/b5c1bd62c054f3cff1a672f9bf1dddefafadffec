powerpc/64: Fix arch_local_irq_disable() prototype

In powerpc/64, the arch_local_irq_disable() function returns unsigned
long, which is not consistent with other architectures.

Move that set-return asm implementation into arch_local_irq_save(),
and make arch_local_irq_disable() return void, simplifying the
assembly.
