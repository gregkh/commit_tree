kconfig: Warn if there is more than one help text

Avoids mistakes like in the following real-world example, where only the
final help string ("Say Y...") was used. This particular example was
fixed in commit 561b29e4ec8d ("media: fix media Kconfig help syntax
issues").

  config DVB_NETUP_UNIDVB
  	...
	select DVB_CXD2841ER if MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT
  	---help---
  	  Support for NetUP PCI express Universal DVB card.
       help
  	Say Y when you want to support NetUP Dual Universal DVB card
        ...

This now prints the following warning:

  drivers/media/pci/netup_unidvb:13: warning: 'DVB_NETUP_UNIDVB' defined with more than one help text -- only the last one will be used

Also free() any extra help strings.
