perf test: Disable test cases 19 and 20 on s390x

The s390x CPU sampling and measurement facilities do not support perf
events of type PERF_TYPE_BREAKPOINT. The test cases are executed and
fail with -ENOENT due to missing hardware support.

Disable the execution of both test cases based on a
platform check. This is the same approach as done for
PowerPC.
