IB/hfi1: Fix infinite loop in 8051 command error path

When an 8051 command times out, the entire DC block is restarted. During
the restart, the host interface version bit is set, which calls
do_8051_command() recursively. The host version bit needs to be set
before the link moves into polling, so the host version bit can be set
in set_local_link_attributes() instead. Thus, the 8051 command functions
can be simplied as a non-locking version (dd->dc8051_lock) of those
functions are no longer needed.
