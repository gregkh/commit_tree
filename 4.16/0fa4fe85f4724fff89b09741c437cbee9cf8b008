bpf: skip unnecessary capability check

The current check statement in BPF syscall will do a capability check
for CAP_SYS_ADMIN before checking sysctl_unprivileged_bpf_disabled. This
code path will trigger unnecessary security hooks on capability checking
and cause false alarms on unprivileged process trying to get CAP_SYS_ADMIN
access. This can be resolved by simply switch the order of the statement
and CAP_SYS_ADMIN is not required anyway if unprivileged bpf syscall is
allowed.
