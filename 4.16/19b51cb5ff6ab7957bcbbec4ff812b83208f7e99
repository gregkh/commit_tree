hrtimer: Clean up 'enum hrtimer_mode'

It's not obvious that the HRTIMER_MODE variants are bit combinations,
because all modes are hard coded constants currently.

Change it so the bit meanings are clear; and use the symbols for creating
modes which combine bits.

While at it get rid of the ugly tail comments as well.
