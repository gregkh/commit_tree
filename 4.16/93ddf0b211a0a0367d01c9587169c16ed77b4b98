staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Flow affinity for non-forwarded traffic

The previous patch ensures Tx flow affinity for forwarded frames,
but for termination traffic the initial flow affinity is determined
based on the skb hash, which is expected to hit only a few Tx queues
when there is a small number of flows.

Instead, use XPS (transmit packet steering) to set netdevice queue
affinity to the sending core.
