doc: convert printk-formats.txt to rst

Documentation/printk-formats.txt is a candidate for conversion to
ReStructuredText format. Some effort has already been made to do this
conversion even thought the suffix is currently .txt

Changes required to complete conversion

 - Move printk-formats.txt to core-api/printk-formats.rst
 - Add entry to Documentation/core-api/index.rst
 - Remove entry from Documentation/00-INDEX
 - Fix minor grammatical errors.
 - Order heading adornments as suggested by rst docs.
 - Use 'Passed by reference' uniformly.
 - Update pointer documentation around %px specifier.
 - Fix erroneous double backticks (to commas).
 - Remove extraneous double backticks (suggested by Jonathan Corbet).
 - Simplify documentation for kobject.
