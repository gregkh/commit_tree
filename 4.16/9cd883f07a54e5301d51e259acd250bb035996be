scsi: qla2xxx: Fix session cleanup for N2N

When connection type is N_Port to N_Port (point-to-point), there
is a possibilty where initiator will not send PLOGI request and
will directly send PRLI. In N2N connection the port has higher
port name sends the PLOGI but not allow to send PRLI if is a
target mode. Only initiator is allowed to send PRLI.

Current driver code deletes old session when it receives PLOGI
request. If we will not receive PLOGI request then we will not
delete old session and create new session. Add check for N2N
with PRLI receive only and trigger cleanup. For this case, the
cleanup requires individual cmd abort instead of using implicit
logout as a broad stroke flush.
