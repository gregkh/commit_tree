scsi: 3w-9xxx: rework lock timeouts

The TW_IOCTL_GET_LOCK ioctl uses do_gettimeofday() to check whether a
lock has expired. This can misbehave due to a concurrent settimeofday()
call, as it is based on 'real' time, and it will overflow in y2038 on
32-bit architectures, producing unexpected results when used across the
overflow time.

This changes it to using monotonic time, using ktime_get() to simplify
the code.
