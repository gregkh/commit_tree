nfs: Referrals should use the same proto setting as their parent

Helen Chao <helen.chao@oracle.com> noticed that when a user
traverses a referral on an NFS/RDMA mount, the resulting submount
always uses TCP.

This behavior does not match the vers= setting when traversing
a referral (vers=4.1 is preserved). It also does not match the
behavior of crossing from the pseudofs into a real filesystem
(proto=rdma is preserved in that case).

The Linux NFS client does not currently support the
fs_locations_info attribute. The situation is similar for all
NFSv4 servers I know of. Therefore until the community has broad
support for fs_locations_info, when following a referral:

 - First try to connect with RPC-over-RDMA. This will fail quickly
   if the client has no RDMA-capable interfaces.

 - If connecting with RPC-over-RDMA fails, or the RPC-over-RDMA
   transport is not available, use TCP.
