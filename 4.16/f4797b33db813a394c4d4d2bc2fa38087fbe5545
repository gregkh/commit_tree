net/ipv6: Add flags and table id to ip6_nh_lookup_table

onlink verification needs to do a lookup in potentially different
table than the table in fib6_config and without the RT6_LOOKUP_F_IFACE
flag. Change ip6_nh_lookup_table to take table id and flags as input
arguments. Both verifications want to ignore link state, so add that
flag can stay in the lookup helper.
