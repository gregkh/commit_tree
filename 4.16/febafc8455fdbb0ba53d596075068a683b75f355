tipc: fix a potental access after delete in tipc_sk_join()

In commit d12d2e12cec2 "tipc: send out join messages as soon as new
member is discovered") we added a call to the function tipc_group_join()
without considering the case that the preceding tipc_sk_publish() might
have failed, and the group item already deleted.

We fix this by returning from tipc_sk_join() directly after the
failed tipc_sk_publish.
