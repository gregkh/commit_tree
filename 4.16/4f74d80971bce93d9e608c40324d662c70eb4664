bpf: fix kallsyms handling for subprogs

Right now kallsyms handling is not working with JITed subprogs.
The reason is that when in 1c2a088a6626 ("bpf: x64: add JIT support
for multi-function programs") in jit_subprogs() they are passed
to bpf_prog_kallsyms_add(), then their prog type is 0, which BPF
core will think it's a cBPF program as only cBPF programs have a
0 type. Thus, they need to inherit the type from the main prog.

Once that is fixed, they are indeed added to the BPF kallsyms
infra, but their tag is 0. Therefore, since intention is to add
them as bpf_prog_F_<tag>, we need to pass them to bpf_prog_calc_tag()
first. And once this is resolved, there is a use-after-free on
prog cleanup: we remove the kallsyms entry from the main prog,
later walk all subprogs and call bpf_jit_free() on them. However,
the kallsyms linkage was never released on them. Thus, do that
for all subprogs right in __bpf_prog_put() when refcount hits 0.
