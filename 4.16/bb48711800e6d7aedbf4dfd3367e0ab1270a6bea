arm64: cpu_errata: Add Kryo to Falkor 1003 errata

The Kryo CPUs are also affected by the Falkor 1003 errata, so
we need to do the same workaround on Kryo CPUs. The MIDR is
slightly more complicated here, where the PART number is not
always the same when looking at all the bits from 15 to 4. Drop
the lower 8 bits and just look at the top 4 to see if it's '2'
and then consider those as Kryo CPUs. This covers all the
combinations without having to list them all out.
