vrf: Fix use after free and double free in vrf_finish_output

Miguel reported an skb use after free / double free in vrf_finish_output
when neigh_output returns an error. The vrf driver should return after
the call to neigh_output as it takes over the skb on error path as well.

Patch is a simplified version of Miguel's patch which was written for 4.9,
and updated to top of tree.
