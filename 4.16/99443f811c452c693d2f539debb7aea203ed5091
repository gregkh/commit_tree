scripts/tags.sh: change find_other_sources() for include directories

The current find done in find_other_sources() excludes directories in
the kernel tree that are named 'include', eg.:

	./security/apparmor/include
	./security/selinux/include
	./drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/include
	./drivers/gpu/drm/amd/acp/include
	./drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/include
	./drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include
	./drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/include

This changes the find command in find_other_sources() to include those
using the -path option.
