drm/i915/selftests: Fix up igt_reset_engine

Now that we skip a per-engine reset on an idle engine, we need to update
the selftest to take that into account. In the process, we find that we
were not stressing the per-engine reset very hard, so add those missing
active resets.

v2: Actually test i915_reset_engine() by loading it with requests.
