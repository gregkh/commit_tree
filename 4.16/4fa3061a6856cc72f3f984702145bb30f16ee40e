PM / core: Add helpers for subsystem callback selection

Add helper routines to find and return a suitable subsystem callback
during the "noirq" phases of system suspend/resume (or analogous)
transitions as well as during the "late" phase of system suspend and
the "early" phase of system resume (or analogous) transitions.

The helpers will be called from additional sites going forward.
