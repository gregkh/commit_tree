ACPI / battery: Add quirk for Asus GL502VSK and UX305LA

On Asus GL502VSK and UX305LA, ACPI incorrectly reports discharging when
battery is full and AC is plugged.

However rate_now is correct under this circumstance, hence we can use
"rate_now == 0" as a predicate to report battery full status correctly.
