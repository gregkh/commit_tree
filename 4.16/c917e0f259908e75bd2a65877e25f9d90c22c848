perf/cgroup: Fix child event counting bug

When a perf_event is attached to parent cgroup, it should count events
for all children cgroups:

   parent_group   <---- perf_event
     \
      - child_group  <---- process(es)

However, in our tests, we found this perf_event cannot report reliable
results. Here is an example case:

  # create cgroups
  mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/p/c
  # start perf for parent group
  perf stat -e instructions -G "p"

  # on another console, run test process in child cgroup:
  stressapptest -s 2 -M 1000 & echo $! > /sys/fs/cgroup/p/c/cgroup.procs

  # after the test process is done, stop perf in the first console shows

       <not counted>      instructions              p

The instruction should not be "not counted" as the process runs in the
child cgroup.

We found this is because perf_event->cgrp and cpuctx->cgrp are not
identical, thus perf_event->cgrp are not updated properly.

This patch fixes this by updating perf_cgroup properly for ancestor
cgroup(s).
