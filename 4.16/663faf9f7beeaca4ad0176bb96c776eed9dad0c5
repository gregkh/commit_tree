error-injection: Add injectable error types

Add injectable error types for each error-injectable function.

One motivation of error injection test is to find software flaws,
mistakes or mis-handlings of expectable errors. If we find such
flaws by the test, that is a program bug, so we need to fix it.

But if the tester miss input the error (e.g. just return success
code without processing anything), it causes unexpected behavior
even if the caller is correctly programmed to handle any errors.
That is not what we want to test by error injection.

To clarify what type of errors the caller must expect for each
injectable function, this introduces injectable error types:

 - EI_ETYPE_NULL : means the function will return NULL if it
		    fails. No ERR_PTR, just a NULL.
 - EI_ETYPE_ERRNO : means the function will return -ERRNO
		    if it fails.
 - EI_ETYPE_ERRNO_NULL : means the function will return -ERRNO
		       (ERR_PTR) or NULL.

ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() macro is expanded to get one of
NULL, ERRNO, ERRNO_NULL to record the error type for
each function. e.g.

 ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION(open_ctree, ERRNO)

This error types are shown in debugfs as below.

  ====
  / # cat /sys/kernel/debug/error_injection/list
  open_ctree [btrfs]	ERRNO
  io_ctl_init [btrfs]	ERRNO
  ====
