virtio_net: fix XDP code path in receive_small()

When configuring virtio_net to use the code path 'receive_small()',
in-order to get correct XDP_REDIRECT support, I discovered TCP packets
would get silently dropped when loading an XDP program action XDP_PASS.

The bug seems to be that receive_small() when XDP is loaded check that
hdr->hdr.flags is zero, which seems wrong as hdr.flags contains the
flags VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_* :
 #define VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_NEEDS_CSUM 1 /* Use csum_start, csum_offset */
 #define VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_DATA_VALID 2 /* Csum is valid */

TCP got dropped as it had the VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_DATA_VALID flag set.

The flags that are relevant here are the VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_* flags
stored in hdr->hdr.gso_type. Thus, the fix is just check that none of
the gso_type flags have been set.
