bpf: hashtab: move attribute validation before allocation

Number of attribute checks are currently performed after hashtab
is already allocated.  Move them to be able to split them out to
the check function later on.  Checks have to now be performed on
the attr union directly instead of the members of bpf_map, since
bpf_map will be allocated later.  No functional changes.
