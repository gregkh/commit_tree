KVM: s390: define GISA format-0 data structure

In preperation to support pass-through adapter interrupts, the Guest
Interruption State Area (GISA) and the Adapter Interruption Virtualization
(AIV) features will be introduced here.

This patch introduces format-0 GISA (that is defines the struct describing
the GISA, allocates storage for it, and introduces fields for the
GISA address in kvm_s390_sie_block and kvm_s390_vsie).

As the GISA requires storage below 2GB, it is put in sie_page2, which is
already allocated in ZONE_DMA. In addition, The GISA requires alignment to
its integral boundary. This is already naturally aligned via the
padding in the sie_page2.
