Input: hil_mlc - convert timeval to jiffies

struct timeval is not y2038 safe, and what mlc->instart do is
scheduling a task in a fixed timeout, so jiffies is the
simplest choice here.

In hilse_donode(), the expires in mod_timer equals

	jiffies + intimeout - (now - instart)

If we use jiffies in 'now', the expires equals

	instart + intimeout

So, all we need to do is that making sure expires is a future
timestamp before passed it to mod_timer.

[arnd: slightly simplified patch further]
