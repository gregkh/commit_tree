drm/etnaviv: remove switch_context member from etnaviv_gpu

There is no need to store this in the gpu struct. MMU flushes are triggered
correctly in reaction to MMU maps and unmaps, independent of the current ctx.
Any required pipe switches can be infered from the current and the desired
GPU exec state.
