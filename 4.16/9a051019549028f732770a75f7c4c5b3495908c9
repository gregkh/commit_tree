scsi: scsi_debug: tab, kstrto changes

Some of my development tools tend to add spaces (my preference) rather
than tabs (kernel convention). Running unexpand to clean these spaces
up found more of them than checkpatch.pl did. Then checkpatch.pl
complained about other style violations in those newly tabbed lines.
