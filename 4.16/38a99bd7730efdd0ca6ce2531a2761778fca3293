i2c: mpc: always determine I2C clock prescaler at runtime

Remove the facility for setting the prescaler value at compile time
entirely. It was only used for two SoCs, duplicating the actual value
for one of them and setting sometimes bogus value for another. Make all
MPC8xxx SoCs obtain their actual I2C clock prescaler from a single place
in the code.

Changes from v2:
- left Device Tree compatibles in place
