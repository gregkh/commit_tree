Makefile: move stack-protector availability out of Kconfig

Various portions of the kernel, especially per-architecture pieces,
need to know if the compiler is building with the stack protector.
This was done in the arch/Kconfig with 'select', but this doesn't
allow a way to do auto-detected compiler support. In preparation for
creating an on-if-available default, move the logic for the definition of
CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR into the Makefile.
