clocksource/drivers/stm32: Compute a prescaler value with a targeted rate

The prescaler value is arbitrarily set to 1024 without any regard to the
timer frequency. For 32-bit timers, there is no need to set a prescaler
value as they wrap in an acceptable interval and give the opportunity to
have precise timers on this platform. However, for 16-bit timers a prescaler
value is needed if we don't want to wrap too often per second which is
inefficient and adds more and more error margin. With a targeted clock
of 10MHz, the 16 bits are precise enough whatever the timer frequency is
as we will compute the prescaler.
