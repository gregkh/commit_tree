powerpc/powernv: Set correct configuration space size for opencapi devices

The configuration space for opencapi devices doesn't have a PCI
Express capability, therefore confusing linux in thinking it's of an
old PCI type with a 256-byte configuration space size, instead of the
desired 4k. So add a PCI fixup to declare the correct size.
