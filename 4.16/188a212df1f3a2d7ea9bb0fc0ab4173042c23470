dm raid: add component device size checks to avoid runtime failure

Check all component data device sizes versus calculated size.
Reject if device(s) are too small.  Otherwise, MD will fail the
operation by accessing beyond the end of the data device.

An example use-case is that growing bitmap won't fit any more and the MD
runtime will report an error when DM raid should catch this earlier.
