mmc: dw_mmc: Fix the DTO/CTO timeout overflow calculation for 32-bit systems

The commit 9d9491a7da2a ("mmc: dw_mmc: Fix the DTO timeout calculation")
and commit 4c2357f57dd5 ("mmc: dw_mmc: Fix the CTO timeout calculation")
made changes, which cause multiply overflow for 32-bit systems. The broken
timeout calculations leads to unexpected ETIMEDOUT errors and causes
stacktrace splat (such as below) during normal data exchange with SD-card.

| Running :  4M-check-reassembly-tcp-cmykw2-rotatew2.out -v0 -w1

| mmcblk0: error -110 transferring data, sector 320544, nr 2048, cmd
| response 0x900, card status 0x0

DIV_ROUND_UP_ULL helps to escape usage of __udivdi3() from libgcc and so
code gets compiled on all 32-bit platforms as opposed to usage of
DIV_ROUND_UP when we may only compile stuff on a very few arches.

Lets cast this multiply to u64 type to prevent the overflow.
