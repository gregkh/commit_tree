slimbus: Add SLIMbus bus type

SLIMbus (Serial Low Power Interchip Media Bus) is a specification
developed by MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) alliance.
SLIMbus is a 2-wire implementation, which is used to communicate with
peripheral components like audio-codec.
SLIMbus uses Time-Division-Multiplexing to accommodate multiple data
channels, and control channel. Control channel has messages to do
device-enumeration, messages to send/receive control-data to/from
SLIMbus devices, messages for port/channel management, and messages to
do bandwidth allocation.
The framework supports multiple instances of the bus (1 controller per
bus), and multiple slave devices per controller.

This patch adds support to basic silmbus core which includes support to
SLIMbus type, slimbus device registeration and some basic data structures.
