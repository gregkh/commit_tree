ACPI / NUMA: ia64: Parse all entries of SRAT memory affinity table

In current implementation, SRAT Memory Affinity Structure table
parsing is restricted to number of maximum memblocks allowed
(NR_NODE_MEMBLKS). However NR_NODE_MEMBLKS is defined individually
as per architecture requirements. Hence removing the restriction of
SRAT Memory Affinity Structure parsing in ACPI driver code and
let architecture code check for allowed memblocks count.

This check is already there in the x86 code, so do the same on ia64.
