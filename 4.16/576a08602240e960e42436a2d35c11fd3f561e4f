ARM: 8728/1: B15: Register reboot notifier for KEXEC

During kexec, we will go through kernel_kexec() -> syscore_suspend() if
CONFIG_KEXEC_JUMP is set, if not, down the road we end-up calling
kernel_restart_prepare() which invokes reboot notifiers with
SYS_RESTART.

We register a reboot notifier to make sure that the B15 read-ahead cache
is disabled, since it is another level of instruction and data cache,
and we want to avoid any potential side effects with booting a new
kernel with such a cache still turned on.
