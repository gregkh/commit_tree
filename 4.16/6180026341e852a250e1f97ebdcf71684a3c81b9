usb: dwc3: gadget: Set maxpacket size for ep0 IN

There are 2 control endpoint structures for DWC3. However, the driver
only updates the OUT direction control endpoint structure during
ConnectDone event. DWC3 driver needs to update the endpoint max packet
size for control IN endpoint as well. If the max packet size is not
properly set, then the driver will incorrectly calculate the data
transfer size and fail to send ZLP for HS/FS 3-stage control read
transfer.

The fix is simply to update the max packet size for the ep0 IN direction
during ConnectDone event.
