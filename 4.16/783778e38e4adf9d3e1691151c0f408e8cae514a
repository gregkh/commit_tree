staging: rtl8192e: remove two redundant assignments

Clang detected two redundant assignments that can be safely removed.
The first is the removal of the duplicated assignment to pointer 'hdr',
this has already been initialized with the same value.  The second is
the removal of the redundant initialization of variable 'timeout', this
assigned value is never read and the variable is reassigned a new value
a little later.

Remove both redundant assignments, cleans up clang warnings:
drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib_rx.c:1305:27: warning: Value stored to
'hdr' during its initialization is never read
drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib_softmac.c:1971:6: warning: Value stored
to 'timeout' during its initialization is never read
