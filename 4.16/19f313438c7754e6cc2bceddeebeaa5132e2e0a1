IB/srp: Add RDMA/CM support

Since the SRP_LOGIN_REQ defined in the SRP standard is larger than
what fits in the RDMA/CM login request private data, introduce a new
login request format for the RDMA/CM.

Note: since srp_daemon and ibsrpdm rely on the subnet manager and
since there is no equivalent of the IB subnet manager in non-IB
networks, login has to be performed manually for non-IB networks.
