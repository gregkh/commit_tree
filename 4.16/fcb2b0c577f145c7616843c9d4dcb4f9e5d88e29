mm: show total hugetlb memory consumption in /proc/meminfo

Currently we display some hugepage statistics (total, free, etc) in
/proc/meminfo, but only for default hugepage size (e.g.  2Mb).

If hugepages of different sizes are used (like 2Mb and 1Gb on x86-64),
/proc/meminfo output can be confusing, as non-default sized hugepages
are not reflected at all, and there are no signs that they are existing
and consuming system memory.

To solve this problem, let's display the total amount of memory,
consumed by hugetlb pages of all sized (both free and used).  Let's call
it "Hugetlb", and display size in kB to match generic /proc/meminfo
style.

For example, (1024 2Mb pages and 2 1Gb pages are pre-allocated):
  $ cat /proc/meminfo
  MemTotal:        8168984 kB
  MemFree:         3789276 kB
  <...>
  CmaFree:               0 kB
  HugePages_Total:    1024
  HugePages_Free:     1024
  HugePages_Rsvd:        0
  HugePages_Surp:        0
  Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
  Hugetlb:         4194304 kB
  DirectMap4k:       32632 kB
  DirectMap2M:     4161536 kB
  DirectMap1G:     6291456 kB

Also, this patch updates corresponding docs to reflect Hugetlb entry
meaning and difference between Hugetlb and HugePages_Total * Hugepagesize.
