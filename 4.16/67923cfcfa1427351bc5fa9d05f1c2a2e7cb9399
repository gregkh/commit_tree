powerpc/eeh: Add EEH operations to notify resume

When pseries SR-IOV is enabled and after a PF driver has resumed from
EEH, platform has to be notified of the event so the child VFs can be
allowed to resume their normal recovery path.

This patch makes the EEH operation allow unfreeze platform dependent
code and adds the call to pseries EEH code.
