dm table: fix NVMe bio-based dm_table_determine_type() validation

The 'verify_rq_based:' code in dm_table_determine_type() was checking
all devices in the DM table rather than only checking the data devices.
Fix this by using the immutable target's iterate_devices method.

Also, tweak the block of dm_table_determine_type() code that decides
whether to upgrade from DM_TYPE_BIO_BASED to DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED so
that it makes sure the immutable_target doesn't support require
splitting IOs.

These changes have been verified to allow a "thin-pool" target whose
data device is an NVMe device to be upgraded to DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED.
Using the thin-pool in NVMe bio-based mode was verified to pass all the
device-mapper-test-suite's "thin-provisioning" tests.

Also verified that request-based DM multipath (with queue_mode "rq" and
"mq") works as expected using the 'mptest' harness.
