spi: sh-msiof: Avoid writing to registers from spi_master.setup()

The spi_master.setup() callback must not change configuration registers,
as that could corrupt I/O that is in progress for other SPI slaves.

The only exception is the configuration of the native chip select
polarity in SPI master mode, as a wrong chip select polarity will cause
havoc during all future transfers to any other SPI slave.

Hence stop writing to registers in sh_msiof_spi_setup(), unless it is
the first call for a controller using a native chip select, or unless
native chip select polarity has changed (note that you'll loose anyway
if I/O is in progress).  Even then, only do what is strictly necessary,
instead of calling sh_msiof_spi_set_pin_regs().
