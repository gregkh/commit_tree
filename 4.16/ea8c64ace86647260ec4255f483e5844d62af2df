dma-mapping: move swiotlb arch helpers to a new header

phys_to_dma, dma_to_phys and dma_capable are helpers published by
architecture code for use of swiotlb and xen-swiotlb only.  Drivers are
not supposed to use these directly, but use the DMA API instead.

Move these to a new asm/dma-direct.h helper, included by a
linux/dma-direct.h wrapper that provides the default linear mapping
unless the architecture wants to override it.

In the MIPS case the existing dma-coherent.h is reused for now as
untangling it will take a bit of work.
