net: hns3: add Asym Pause support to phy default features

commit c4fb2cdf575d ("net: hns3: fix a bug for phy supported feature
initialization") adds default supported features for phy, but our hardware
also supports Asym Pause. This patch adds Asym Pause support to phy
default features to prevent Asym Pause can not be advertised when the phy
negotiates flow control.
