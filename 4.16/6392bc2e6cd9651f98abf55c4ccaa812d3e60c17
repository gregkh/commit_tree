media: dvb-frontends/stv0910: cleanup init_search_param() and enable PLS

Cleanup the mess in init_search_param() by utilising the new register
access macros and functions. And while at it, move the ISI and PLS setup
into separate functions, and pass the new scrambling_sequence_index (aka.
physical layer scrambling) value to set_pls.

Picked up from the dddvb upstream, adapted to the different naming of the
pls property (pls vs. scrambling_sequence_index).
