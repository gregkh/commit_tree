errseq: Add to documentation tree

 - Move errseq.rst into core-api
 - Add errseq to the core-api index
 - Promote the header to a more prominent header type, otherwise we get three
   entries in the table of contents.
 - Reformat the table to look nicer and be a little more proportional in
   terms of horizontal width per bit (the SF bit is still disproportionately
   large, but there's no way to fix that).
 - Include errseq kernel-doc in the errseq.rst
 - Neaten some kernel-doc markup
