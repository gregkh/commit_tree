cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add Skylake servers support

Currently intel_pstate can function only in HWP mode on Skylake servers.
When HWP feature is not enabled on the processor then acpi-cpufreq is
driver is used.

Based on the power and performance tests using intel_pstate scaling
algorithm the results are comparable. But intel_pstate brings in
additional features:
 - Display of turbo frequency range, which many users like to see
 - Place limits in the turbo frequency range when platform allows

Since these tests are done only using non PID algorithm introduced in
kernel version 4.14, this patch is not a backport candidate. So each user
has to carefully weigh the benefits before he backports.
