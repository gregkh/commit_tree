rcu: Define rcu_irq_{enter,exit}() in terms of rcu_nmi_{enter,exit}()

RCU currently uses two different mechanisms for tracking irqs and NMIs.
This is unnecessary complexity: Given that NMIs can nest and given that
RCU's tracking handles such nesting, the NMI tracking mechanism can also
be used to track irqs.  This commit therefore defines rcu_irq_enter()
in terms of rcu_nmi_enter() and rcu_irq_exit() in terms of rcu_nmi_exit().

Unfortunately, callers must still distinguish between the irq and NMI
functions because additional actions are taken when an irq interrupts
idle or nohz_full usermode execution, and these actions cannot always
be taken from NMI handlers.
