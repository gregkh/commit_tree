i40e: Fix for adding multiple ethtool filters on the same location

This patch reorders i40e_add_del_fdir and i40e_update_ethtool_fdir_entry
calls so that we first remove an already existing filter (inside
i40e_update_ethtool_fdir_entry using i40e_add_del_fdir) and then
we add a new one with i40e_add_del_fdir.
After applying this patch, creating multiple identical filters (with
the same location) one after another doesn't revert their behavior
but behaves correctly.
