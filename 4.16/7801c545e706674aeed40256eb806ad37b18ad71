soc: imx: gpc: de-register power domains only if initialized

If power domain information are missing in the device tree, no
power domains get initialized. However, imx_gpc_remove tries to
remove power domains always in the old DT binding case. Only
remove power domains when imx_gpc_probe initialized them in
first place.
