scsi: qla2xxx: Fix NULL pointer crash due to probe failure

This patch fixes regression added by commit d74595278f4ab
("scsi: qla2xxx: Add multiple queue pair functionality.").

When driver is not able to get reqeusted IRQs from the system, driver will
attempt tp clean up memory before failing hardware probe. During this cleanup,
driver assigns NULL value to the pointer which has not been allocated by
driver yet. This results in a NULL pointer access.

Log file will show following message and stack trace

qla2xxx [0000:a3:00.1]-00c7:21: MSI-X: Failed to enable support, giving up -- 32/-1.
qla2xxx [0000:a3:00.1]-0037:21: Falling back-to MSI mode --1.
