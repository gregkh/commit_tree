checkpatch: add a few DEVICE_ATTR style tests

DEVICE_ATTR is a declaration macro that has a few alternate and
preferred forms like DEVICE_ATTR_RW, DEVICE_ATTR_RO, and DEVICE_ATTR.

As well, many uses of DEVICE_ATTR could use the preferred forms when the
show or store functions are also named in a regular form.

Suggest the preferred forms when appropriate.

Also emit a permissions warning if the the permissions are not the
typical 0644, 0444, or 0200.
