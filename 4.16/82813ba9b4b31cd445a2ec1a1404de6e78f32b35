drm/i915: Only prune fences after wait-for-all

Currently, we only allow ourselves to prune the fences so long as
all the waits completed (i.e. all the fences we checked were signaled),
and that the reservation snapshot did not change across the wait.
However, if we only waited for a subset of the reservation object, i.e.
just waiting for the last writer to complete as opposed to all readers
as well, then we would erroneously conclude we could prune the fences as
indeed although all of our waits were successful, they did not represent
the totality of the reservation object.

v2: We only need to check the shared fences due to construction (i.e.
all of the shared fences will be later than the exclusive fence, if
any).
