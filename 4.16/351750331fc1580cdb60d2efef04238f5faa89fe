powerpc/mm: Introduce _PAGE_NA

Today, PAGE_NONE is defined as a page not having _PAGE_USER.
In some circunstances, when the CPU supports it, it might be
better to be able to flag a page with NO ACCESS.

In a following patch, the 8xx will switch user access being flagged
in the PMD, therefore it will not be possible anymore to use
_PAGE_USER as a way to flag a page with no access.
