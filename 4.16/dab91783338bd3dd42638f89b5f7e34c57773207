drm/i915: expose command stream timestamp frequency to userspace

We use to have this fixed per generation, but starting with CNL userspace
cannot tell just off the PCI ID. Let's make this information available. This
is particularly useful for performance monitoring where much of the
normalization work is done using those timestamps (this include pipeline
statistics in both GL & Vulkan as well as OA reports).

v2: Use variables for 24MHz/19.2MHz values (Ewelina)
    Renamed function & coding style (Sagar)

v3: Fix frequency read on Broadwell (Sagar)
    Fix missing divide by 4 on <= gen4 (Sagar)
