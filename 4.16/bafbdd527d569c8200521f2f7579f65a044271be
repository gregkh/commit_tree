phylib: Add device reset GPIO support

The PHY devices sometimes do have their reset signal (maybe even power
supply?) tied to some GPIO and sometimes it also does happen that a boot
loader does not leave it deasserted. So far this issue has been attacked
from (as I believe) a wrong angle: by teaching the MAC driver to manipulate
the GPIO in question; that solution, when applied to the device trees, led
to adding the PHY reset GPIO properties to the MAC device node, with one
exception: Cadence MACB driver which could handle the "reset-gpios" prop
in a PHY device subnode. I believe that the correct approach is to teach
the 'phylib' to get the MDIO device reset GPIO from the device tree node
corresponding to this device -- which this patch is doing...

Note that I had to modify the AT803x PHY driver as it would stop working
otherwise -- it made use of the reset GPIO for its own purposes...
