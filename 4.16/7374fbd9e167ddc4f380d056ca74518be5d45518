RDMA/bnxt_re: Avoid system hang during device un-reg

BNXT_RE_FLAG_TASK_IN_PROG doesn't handle multiple work
requests posted together. Track schedule of multiple
workqueue items by maintaining a per device counter
and proceed with IB dereg only if this counter is zero.
flush_workqueue is no longer required from
NETDEV_UNREGISTER path.
