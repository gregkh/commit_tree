phy: phy-brcm-usb-init: Some Low Speed keyboards fail on 7271

Enable the the Low Speed Keep Alive signal on the 7271b0 by setting
the LS_KEEP_ALIVE bit in the USB CTRL OBRIDGE register otherwise
some Dell Low Speed keyboards fail.

Also do a little cleanup of the EBRIDGE ESTOP_SCB_REQ bit. Since
this is only used on one platform, remove it from the platform
tables and just use "if (family == ").
