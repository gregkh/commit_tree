btrfs: Move checks from btrfs_wq_run_delayed_node to btrfs_balance_delayed_items

btrfs_balance_delayed_items is the sole caller of
btrfs_wq_run_delayed_node and already includes one of the checks whether
the delayed inodes should be run. On the other hand
btrfs_wq_run_delayed_node duplicates that check and performs an
additional one for wq congestion.

Let's remove the duplicate check and move the congestion one in
btrfs_balance_delayed_items, leaving btrfs_wq_run_delayed_node to only
care about setting up the wq run. No functional changes.
