regmap: Add one flag to indicate if a hwlock should be used

Since the hwlock id 0 is valid for hardware spinlock core, but now id 0
is treated as one invalid value for regmap. Thus we should add one extra
flag for regmap config to indicate if a hardware spinlock should be used,
then id 0 can be valid for regmap to request.
