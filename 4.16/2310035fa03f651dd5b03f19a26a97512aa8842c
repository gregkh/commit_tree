bpf: fix incorrect kmalloc usage in lpm_trie MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY rcu region

In commit b471f2f1de8b ("bpf: implement MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY command for LPM_TRIE map"),
the implemented MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY callback function is guarded with rcu read lock.
In the function body, "kmalloc(size, GFP_USER | __GFP_NOWARN)" is used which may
sleep and violate rcu read lock region requirements. This patch fixed the issue
by using GFP_ATOMIC instead to avoid blocking kmalloc. Tested with
CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y as suggested by Eric Dumazet.
