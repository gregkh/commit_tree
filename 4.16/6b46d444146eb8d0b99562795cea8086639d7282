ubifs: free the encrypted symlink target

ubifs_symlink() forgot to free the kmalloc()'ed buffer holding the
encrypted symlink target, creating a memory leak.  Fix it.

(UBIFS could actually encrypt directly into ui->data, removing the
temporary buffer, but that is left for the patch that switches to use
the symlink helper functions.)
