drm/sun4i: Use values calculated by atomic check

Now that we have properly clipped coordinates in plane state structure,

This also fixes bug where source x and y were adjusted for negative
value, but width and height weren't. It wasn't discovered because
primary plane usually doesn't have negative coordinates.
