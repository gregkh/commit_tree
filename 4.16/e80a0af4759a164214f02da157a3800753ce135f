lib/scatterlist: Introduce sgl_alloc() and sgl_free()

Many kernel drivers contain code that allocates and frees both a
scatterlist and the pages that populate that scatterlist.
Introduce functions in lib/scatterlist.c that perform these tasks
instead of duplicating this functionality in multiple drivers.
Only include these functions in the build if CONFIG_SGL_ALLOC=y
to avoid that the kernel size increases if this functionality is
not used.
