ARM: dts: exynos: Switch to dedicated Odroid XU3 sound card binding

The new sound card DT binding is used for Odroid XU3 in order
to properly support the HDMI audio path.  Clocks configuration is
changed so the I2S controller is now the bit clock and the frame clock
master.  The EPLL output clock is now the audio root clock adjusted to
each audio sample rate.
