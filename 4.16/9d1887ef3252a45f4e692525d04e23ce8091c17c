KVM: nVMX: sync vmcs02 segment regs prior to vmx_set_cr0

Segment registers must be synchronized prior to any code that may
trigger a call to emulation_required()/guest_state_valid(), e.g.
vmx_set_cr0().  Because preparing vmcs02 writes segmentation fields
directly, i.e. doesn't use vmx_set_segment(), emulation_required
will not be re-evaluated when synchronizing the segment registers,
which can result in L0 incorrectly starting emulation of L2.
