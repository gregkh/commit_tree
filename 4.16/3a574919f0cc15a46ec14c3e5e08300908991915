mmc: core: Avoid hanging to claim host for mmc via some nested calls

As the block layer, since the conversion to blkmq, claims the host using a
context, a following nested call to mmc_claim_host(), which isn't using a
context, may hang.

Calling mmc_interrupt_hpi() and mmc_read_bkops_status() via the mmc block
layer, may suffer from this problem, as these functions are calling
mmc_claim|release_host().

Let's fix the problem by removing the calls to mmc_claim|release_host()
from the above mentioned functions and instead make the callers responsible
of claiming/releasing the host. As a matter of fact, the existing callers
already deals with it.
