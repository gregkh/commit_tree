ath10k: Add paddrs_ring_64 support for 64bit target

paddrs_ring_64 holds the physical device address of the
rx buffers that host SW provides for the MAC HW to fill.
Since this field is used in rx ring setup and rx ring
replenish in rx data path. Define separate methods
for handling 64 bit ring paddr and attach them dynamically
based on target_64bit hw param flag. Use u64 type
while popping paddr from the rx hash table for 64bit target.
