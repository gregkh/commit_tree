batman-adv: Fix netlink dumping of BLA backbones

The function batadv_bla_backbone_dump_bucket must be able to handle
non-complete dumps of a single bucket. It tries to do that by saving the
latest dumped index in *idx_skip to inform the caller about the current
state.

But the caller only assumes that buckets were not completely dumped when
the return code is non-zero. This function must therefore also return a
non-zero index when the dumping of an entry failed. Otherwise the caller
will just skip all remaining buckets.

And the function must also reset *idx_skip back to zero when it finished a
bucket. Otherwise it will skip the same number of entries in the next
bucket as the previous one had.
