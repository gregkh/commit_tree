SUNRPC: task_run_action should display tk_callback

This shows up in every RPC:

     kworker/4:1-19772 [004]  3467.373443: rpc_task_run_action:  task:4711@2 flags=0e81 state=0005 status=0 action=call_status
     kworker/4:1-19772 [004]  3467.373444: rpc_task_run_action:  task:4711@2 flags=0e81 state=0005 status=0 action=call_status

What's actually going on is that the first iteration of the RPC
scheduler is invoking the function in tk_callback (in this case,
xprt_timer), then invoking call_status on the next iteration.

Feeding do_action, rather than tk_action, to the "task_run_action"
trace point will now always display the correct FSM step.
