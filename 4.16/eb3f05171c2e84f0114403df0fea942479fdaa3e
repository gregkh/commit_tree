drm/i915/gvt: refine function emulate_mmio_read/write

These 2 functions are coded by multiple person in multiple patches. The
'return' and 'goto err' are mix-used in same place, which cause the
function looks disorder. Unify to use only 'goto' so that the gvt lock
is acquired in one place and released in one place.
