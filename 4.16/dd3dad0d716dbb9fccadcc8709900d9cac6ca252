ftrace: Mark function tracer test functions noinline/noclone

The ftrace function tracer self tests calls some functions to verify
the get traced. This relies on them not being inlined. Previously
this was ensured by putting them into another file, but with LTO
the compiler can inline across files, which makes the tests fail.

Mark these functions as noinline and noclone.
