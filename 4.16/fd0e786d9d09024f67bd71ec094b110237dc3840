x86/mm, mm/hwpoison: Don't unconditionally unmap kernel 1:1 pages

In the following commit:

  ce0fa3e56ad2 ("x86/mm, mm/hwpoison: Clear PRESENT bit for kernel 1:1 mappings of poison pages")

... we added code to memory_failure() to unmap the page from the
kernel 1:1 virtual address space to avoid speculative access to the
page logging additional errors.

But memory_failure() may not always succeed in taking the page offline,
especially if the page belongs to the kernel.  This can happen if
there are too many corrected errors on a page and either mcelog(8)
or drivers/ras/cec.c asks to take a page offline.

Since we remove the 1:1 mapping early in memory_failure(), we can
end up with the page unmapped, but still in use. On the next access
the kernel crashes :-(

There are also various debug paths that call memory_failure() to simulate
occurrence of an error. Since there is no actual error in memory, we
don't need to map out the page for those cases.

Revert most of the previous attempt and keep the solution local to
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c. Unmap the page only when:

	1) there is a real error
	2) memory_failure() succeeds.

All of this only applies to 64-bit systems. 32-bit kernel doesn't map
all of memory into kernel space. It isn't worth adding the code to unmap
the piece that is mapped because nobody would run a 32-bit kernel on a
machine that has recoverable machine checks.
