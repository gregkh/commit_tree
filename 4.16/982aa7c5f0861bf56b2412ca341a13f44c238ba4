arm64: add kconfig symbol to configure physical address size

ARMv8.2 introduces support for 52-bit physical addresses. To prepare for
supporting this, add a new kconfig symbol to configure the physical
address space size. The symbols will be used in subsequent patches.
Currently the only choice is 48, a later patch will add the option of 52
once the required code is in place.
