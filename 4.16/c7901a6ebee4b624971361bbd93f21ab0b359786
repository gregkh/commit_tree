KVM: s390: reverse bit ordering of irqs in pending mask

This patch prepares a simplification of bit operations between the irq
pending mask for emulated interrupts and the Interruption Pending Mask
(IPM) which is part of the Guest Interruption State Area (GISA), a feature
that allows interrupt delivery to guests by means of the SIE instruction.

Without that change, a bit-wise *or* operation on parts of these two masks
would either require a look-up table of size 256 bytes to map the IPM
to the emulated irq pending mask bit orientation (all bits mirrored at half
byte) or a sequence of up to 8 condidional branches to perform tests of
single bit positions. Both options are to be rejected either by performance
or space utilization reasons.

Beyond that this change will be transparent.
