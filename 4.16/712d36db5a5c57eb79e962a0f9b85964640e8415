perf report: Set browser mode right before setup_browser()

There are codes that print messages to the screen between assignment of
the use_browser variable and setup_browser().

But since the GUI browser is not initialized during that period, all
messages fail to show if the user passed the --gtk option to perf as GTK
is not initialized yet.

Reorder the code to assign use_browser variable right before
setup_browser() is called.
