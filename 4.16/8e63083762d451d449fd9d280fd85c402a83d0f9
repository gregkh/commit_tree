xfs: move all scrub input checking to xfs_scrub_validate

There were ad-hoc checks for some scrub types but not others;
mark each scrub type with ... it's type, and use that to validate
the allowed and/or required input fields.

Moving these checks out of xfs_scrub_setup_ag_header makes it
a thin wrapper, so unwrap it in the process.
