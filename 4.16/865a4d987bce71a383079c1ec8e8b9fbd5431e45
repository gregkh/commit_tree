ixgbevf: don't bother clearing tx_buffer_info in ixgbevf_clean_tx_ring()

In the case of the Tx rings we need to only clear the Tx buffer_info when
we are resetting the rings.  Ideally we do this when we configure the ring
to bring it back up instead of when we are taking it down in order to avoid
dirtying pages we don't need to.

In addition we don't need to clear the Tx descriptor ring since we will
fully repopulate it when we begin transmitting frames and next_to_watch can
be cleared to prevent the ring from being cleaned beyond that point instead
of needing to touch anything in the Tx descriptor ring.

Finally with these changes we can avoid having to reset the skb member of
the Tx buffer_info structure in the cleanup path since the skb will always
be associated with the first buffer which has next_to_watch set.
