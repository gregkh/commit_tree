Revert "gpio: set up initial state from .get_direction()"

This reverts commit 72d3200061776264941be1b5a9bb8e926b3b30a5.

We cannot blindly query the direction of all GPIOs when the pins are
first registered.  The get_direction callback normally triggers a
read/write to hardware, but we shouldn't be touching the hardware for
an individual GPIO until after it's been properly claimed.
