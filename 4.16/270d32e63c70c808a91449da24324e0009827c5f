ntb_hw_switchtec: Crosslink doorbells and messages

In a crosslink configuration doorbells and messages largely work the
same but the NTB registers must be accessed through the reserved LUT
window. Also, as a bonus, seeing there are now two independent sets of
NTB links, both partitions can actually use all 60 doorbell registers
instead of them having to be split into two for each partition.
