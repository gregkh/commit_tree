rds: tcp: remove redundant function rds_tcp_conn_paths_destroy()

A side-effect of Commit c14b0366813a ("rds: tcp: set linger to 1
when unloading a rds-tcp") is that we always send a RST on the tcp
connection for rds_conn_destroy(), so rds_tcp_conn_paths_destroy()
is not needed any more and is removed in this patch.
