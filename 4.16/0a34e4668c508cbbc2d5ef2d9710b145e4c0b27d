nvme: Don't use a stack buffer for keep-alive command

In nvme_keep_alive() we pass a request with a pointer to an NVMe command on
the stack into blk_execute_rq_nowait().  However, the block layer doesn't
guarantee that the request is fully queued before blk_execute_rq_nowait()
returns.  If not, and the request is queued after nvme_keep_alive() returns,
then we'll end up using stack memory that might have been overwritten to
form the NVMe command we pass to hardware.

Fix this by keeping a special command struct in the nvme_ctrl struct right
next to the delayed work struct used for keep-alives.
