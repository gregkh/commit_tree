i2c: sh_mobile: add new frequency calculation for later SoC

The formula to generate the desired bus speeds has changed a little over
time. Implement the new formula and allow drivers to opt-in by changing
to this new config set. Ensure in probe that we don't divide by zero.
The returned values on a R-Car H2 (r8a7790/Lager board) match the
suggested values in the datasheet.
