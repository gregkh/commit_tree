bpf: offload: don't use prog->aux->offload as boolean

We currently use aux->offload to indicate that program is bound
to a specific device.  This forces us to keep the offload structure
around even after the device is gone.  Add a bool member to
struct bpf_prog_aux to indicate if offload was requested.
