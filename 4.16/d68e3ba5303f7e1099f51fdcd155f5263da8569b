drivers/firmware: Expose psci_get_version through psci_ops structure

Entry into recent versions of ARM Trusted Firmware will invalidate the CPU
branch predictor state in order to protect against aliasing attacks.

This patch exposes the PSCI "VERSION" function via psci_ops, so that it
can be invoked outside of the PSCI driver where necessary.
