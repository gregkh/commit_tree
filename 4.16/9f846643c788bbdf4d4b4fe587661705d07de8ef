drm/i915: Remove most encoder->type uses from the audio code

encoder->type isn't genreally safe around DDI ports, so let's
replace some uses in the audio code with the crtc state's
output_types instead.

Actually in these cases encoder->type would work since the DP
SST case is only relevant for VLV/CHV and encoder->type==DP
is a thing on those platforms. The DP MST cases would work
as well since MST encoder->type==DP_MST always. But I think
it's best to try and minimize the encoder->type use in general
to avoid showing a bad example to people.
