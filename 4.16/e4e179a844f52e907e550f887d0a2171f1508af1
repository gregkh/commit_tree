staging: android: ion: Switch from WARN to pr_warn

Syzbot reported a warning with Ion:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3502 at drivers/staging/android/ion/ion-ioctl.c:73 ion_ioctl+0x2db/0x380 drivers/staging/android/ion/ion-ioctl.c:73
Kernel panic - not syncing: panic_on_warn set ...

This is a warning that validation of the ioctl fields failed. This was
deliberately added as a warning to make it very obvious to developers that
something needed to be fixed. In reality, this is overkill and disturbs
fuzzing. Switch to pr_warn for a message instead.
