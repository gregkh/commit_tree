kconfig: show '?' prompt even if no help text is available

'make config', 'make oldconfig', etc. always receive '?' as a valid
input and show useful information even if no help text is available.

------------------------>8------------------------
foo (FOO) [N/y] (NEW) ?

There is no help available for this option.
Symbol: FOO [=n]
Type  : bool
Prompt: foo
  Defined at Kconfig:1
------------------------>8------------------------

However, '?' is not shown in the prompt if its help text is missing.
Let's show '?' all the time so that the prompt and the behavior match.
