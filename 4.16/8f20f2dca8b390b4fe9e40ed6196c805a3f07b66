staging: most: usb: clear functional stall on OUT endpoint

For the MOST packet channel there are two dedicated USB endpoints. But
internally the hardware has actually one channel for data forwarding from
and to MOST. To have the hardware clean up its state machine correctly in
case of an error, both USB pipes need to be reset.  This patch triggers the
host to also clear the OUT endpoint's halt condition in case an IN endpoint
has signaled to be stalled.
