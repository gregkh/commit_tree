drm/i915: There is only one fault register from GEN8 onwards

Until Haswell/Baytrail, the hardware used to have a per engine fault
register (e.g. 0x4094 - render fault register, 0x4194 - media fault
register and so on). But since Broadwell, all these registers were
combined into a singe one and the engine id stored in bits 14:12.

Not only we should not been reading (and writing to) registers that do
not exist, in platforms with VCS2 (SKL), the address that would belong
this engine (0x4494, VCS2_HW = 4) is already assigned to other register.

v2: use less controversial function names (Chris).
v3: make non-exported functions static, remove now obsolete check for
engine presence before posting_read (Chris).
