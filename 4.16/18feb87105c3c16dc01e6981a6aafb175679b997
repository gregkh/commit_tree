enic: add wq clean up budget

In case of tx clean up, we set '-1' as budget. This means clean up until
wq is empty or till (1 << 32) pkts are cleaned. Under heavy load this
will run for long time and cause
"watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#25 stuck for 21s!" warning.

This patch sets wq clean up budget to 256.
