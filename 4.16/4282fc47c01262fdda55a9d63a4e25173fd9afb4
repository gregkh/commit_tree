sh_eth: kill redundant check in the probe() method

Browsing thru the driver disassembly, I noticed that gcc was  able to
figure  out  that the 'ndev' pointer is always non-NULL when calling
free_netdev()  on the probe() method's  error path and  thus skip that
redundant NULL check... gcc is smart, be like gcc! :-)
