libbpf: prefer global symbols as bpf program name source

Libbpf picks the name of the first symbol in the corresponding
elf section to use as a program name. But without taking symbol's
scope into account it may end's up with some local label
as a program name. E.g.:

$ bpftool prog
1: type 15  name LBB0_10    tag 0390a5136ba23f5c
	loaded_at Dec 07/17:22  uid 0
	xlated 456B  not jited  memlock 4096B

Fix this by preferring global symbols as program name.

For instance:
$ bpftool prog
1: type 15  name bpf_prog1  tag 0390a5136ba23f5c
	loaded_at Dec 07/17:26  uid 0
	xlated 456B  not jited  memlock 4096B
