Revert "extcon: axp288: Redo charger type detection a couple of seconds after probe()"

Redoing the charger type detection to give the usb-role-switch code time
to properly set the role-switch is no good for mainline, since the
usb-role-switch code is not yet in mainline (my bad, sorry).

Also once we've that code there are better ways to fix this which are
not prone to racing as doing a retry after 2 seconds is.

This reverts commit 50082c17bb1455acacd376ae30dff92f2e1addbd.
