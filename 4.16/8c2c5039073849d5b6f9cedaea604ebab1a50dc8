fm10k: stop adding VLAN 0 to the VLAN table

Currently, when the driver loads, it sends a request to add VLAN 0 to the
VLAN table. For the PF, this is honored, and VLAN 0 is indeed set. For
the VF, this request is silently converted into a request for the
default VLAN as defined by either the switch vid or the PF vid.

This results in the odd behavior that the VLAN table doesn't appear
consistent between the PF and the VF.

Furthermore, setting a MAC filter with VLAN 0 is generally considered an
invalid configuration by the switch, and since commit 856dfd69e84f
("fm10k: Fix multicast mode synch issues", 2016-03-03) we've had code
which prevents us from ever sending such a request.

Since there's not really a good reason to keep VLAN 0 in the VLAN table,
stop requesting it in fm10k_restore_rx_state().

This might seem to indicate that we would no longer properly configure
the MAC and VLAN tables for the default vid. However, due to the way
that fm10k_find_next_vlan() behaves, it will always return the
default_vid as enabled.
