mmc: sdhci_f_sdh30: add ACPI support

The Fujitsu SDH30 SDHCI controller may be described as a SCX0002 ACPI
device on ACPI platforms incorporating the Socionext SynQuacer SoC.

Given that mmc_of_parse() has already been made ACPI/DT agnostic,
making the SDH30 driver ACPI capable is actually rather simple:
all we need to do is make the call to sdhci_get_of_property() [which
does not set any properties we care about] and the clock handling
dependent on whether we are dealing with a DT device, and exposing
the ACPI id via the platform_driver struct and the module metadata.
