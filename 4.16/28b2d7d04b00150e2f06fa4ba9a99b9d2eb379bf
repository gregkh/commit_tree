nfp: fix XPB register reads in debug dump

For XPB registers reads, some island IDs require special handling (e.g.
ARM island), which is already taken care of in nfp_xpb_readl(), so use
that instead of a straight CPP read.

Without this fix all "xpbm:ArmIsldXpbmMap.*" registers are reported as
0xffffffff. It has also been observed to cause a system reboot.

With this fix correct values are reported, none of which are 0xffffffff.

The values may be read using ethtool debug level 2.
 # ethtool -W <netdev> 2
 # ethtool -w <netdev> data dump.dat
