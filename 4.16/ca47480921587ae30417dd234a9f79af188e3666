xtensa: fix futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic

Return 0 if the operation was successful, not the userspace memory
value. Check that userspace value equals passed oldval, not itself.
Don't update *uval if the value wasn't read from userspace memory.

This fixes process hang due to infinite loop in futex_lock_pi.
It also fixes a bunch of glibc tests nptl/tst-mutexpi*.
