tcmu: make ring buffer timer configurable

This adds a timer, qfull_time_out, that controls how long a
device will wait for ring buffer space to open before
failing the commands in the queue. It is useful to separate
this timer from the cmd_time_out and default 30 sec one,
because for HA setups cmd_time_out may be disbled and 30
seconds is too long to wait when some OSs like ESX will
timeout commands after as little as 8 - 15 seconds.
