KVM: arm/arm64: Limit icache invalidation to prefetch aborts

We've so far eagerly invalidated the icache, no matter how
the page was faulted in (data or prefetch abort).

But we can easily track execution by setting the XN bits
in the S2 page tables, get the prefetch abort at HYP and
perform the icache invalidation at that time only.

As for most VMs, the instruction working set is pretty
small compared to the data set, this is likely to save
some traffic (specially as the invalidation is broadcast).
