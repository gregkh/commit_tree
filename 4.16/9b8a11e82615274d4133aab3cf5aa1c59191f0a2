soc: qcom: Introduce QMI encoder/decoder

Add the helper library for encoding and decoding QMI encoded messages.
The implementation is taken from lib/qmi_encdec.c of the Qualcomm kernel
(msm-3.18).

Modifications has been made to the public API, source buffers has been
made const and the debug-logging part was omitted, for now.
