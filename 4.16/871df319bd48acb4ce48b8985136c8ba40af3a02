crypto: inside-secure - EIP97 support

The Inside Secure SafeXcel driver was firstly designed to support the
EIP197 cryptographic engine which is an evolution (with much more
feature, better performances) of the EIP97 cryptographic engine. This
patch convert the Inside Secure SafeXcel driver to support both engines
(EIP97 + EIP197).

The main differences are the register offsets and the context
invalidation process which is EIP197 specific. This patch adds an
indirection on the register offsets and adds checks not to send any
invalidation request when driving the EIP97. A new compatible is added
as well to bind the driver from device trees.
