f2fs: avoid high cpu usage in discard thread

We take very long time to finish generic/476, this is because we will
check consistence of all discard entries in global rb tree while
traversing all different granularity pending lists, even when the list
is empty, in order to avoid that unneeded overhead, we have to skip
the check when coming up an empty list.

generic/476 time consumption:
					cost
Before patch & w/o consistence check	57s
Before patch & w/ consistence check	1426s
After patch				78s
