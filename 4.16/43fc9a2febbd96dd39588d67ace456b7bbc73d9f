arm_pmu: acpi: check for mismatched PPIs

The arm_pmu platform code explicitly checks for mismatched PPIs at probe
time, while the ACPI code leaves this to the core code. Future
refactoring will make this difficult for the core code to check, so
let's have the ACPI code check this explicitly.

As before, upon a failure we'll continue on without an interrupt. Ho
hum.
