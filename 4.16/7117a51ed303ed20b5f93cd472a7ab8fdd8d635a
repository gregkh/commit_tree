clk: qcom: ipq8074: add NSS ethernet port clocks

IPQ8074 has 6 ethernet ports which supports all ethernet speeds
from 10Mpbs to 10 Gpbs and each speed requires different clock
rates. Each port has separate TX and RX clocks. These clocks
use separate external UNIPHY PLLâ€™s which will be registered with
separate NSS driver. The clock frequency is 125 Mhz for UNIPHY0
and 312.5 Mhz for UNIPHY1 and UNIPHY2.
