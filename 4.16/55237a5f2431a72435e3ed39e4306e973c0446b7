Btrfs: fix extent state leak from tree log

It's possible that btrfs_sync_log() bails out after one of the two
btrfs_write_marked_extents() which convert extent state's state bit into
EXTENT_NEED_WAIT from EXTENT_DIRTY/EXTENT_NEW, however only EXTENT_DIRTY
and EXTENT_NEW are searched by free_log_tree() so that those extent states
with EXTENT_NEED_WAIT lead to memory leak.
