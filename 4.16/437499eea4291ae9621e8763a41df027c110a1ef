X.509: fix BUG_ON() when hash algorithm is unsupported

The X.509 parser mishandles the case where the certificate's signature's
hash algorithm is not available in the crypto API.  In this case,
x509_get_sig_params() doesn't allocate the cert->sig->digest buffer;
this part seems to be intentional.  However,
public_key_verify_signature() is still called via
x509_check_for_self_signed(), which triggers the 'BUG_ON(!sig->digest)'.

Fix this by making public_key_verify_signature() return -ENOPKG if the
hash buffer has not been allocated.

Reproducer when all the CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512* options are disabled:

    openssl req -new -sha512 -x509 -batch -nodes -outform der \
        | keyctl padd asymmetric desc @s
