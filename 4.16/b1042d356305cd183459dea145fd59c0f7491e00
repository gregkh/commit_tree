netlink: convert netlink tap spinlock to mutex

Both netlink_add_tap() and netlink_remove_tap() are
called in process context, no need to bother spinlock.

Note, in fact, currently we always hold RTNL when calling
these two functions, so we don't need any other lock at
all, but keeping this lock doesn't harm anything.
