blk-mq: silence false positive warnings in hctx_unlock()

In some stupider versions of gcc, it complains:

block/blk-mq.c: In function ‘blk_mq_complete_request’:
./include/linux/srcu.h:175:2: warning: ‘srcu_idx’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  __srcu_read_unlock(sp, idx);
  ^
block/blk-mq.c:620:6: note: ‘srcu_idx’ was declared here
  int srcu_idx;
      ^

which is completely bogus, since we only use srcu_idx when
hctx->flags & BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING is set, and that's the case where
hctx_lock() has initialized it.

Just set it to '0' in the normal path in hctx_lock() to silence
this annoying warning.
