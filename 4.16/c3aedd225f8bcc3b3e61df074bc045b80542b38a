nvme_fc: cleanup io completion

There was some old cold that dealt with complete_rq being called
prior to the lldd returning the io completion. This is garbage code.
The complete_rq routine was being called after eh_timeouts were
called and it was due to eh_timeouts not being handled properly.
The timeouts were fixed in prior patches so that in general, a
timeout will initiate an abort and the reset timer restarted as
the abort operation will take care of completing things. Given the
reset timer restarted, the erroneous complete_rq calls were eliminated.

So remove the work that was synchronizing complete_rq with io
completion.
