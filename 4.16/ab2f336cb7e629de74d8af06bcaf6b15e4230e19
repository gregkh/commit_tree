Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Make shutdown and device wake GPIO optional

According to the devicetree binding the shutdown and device wake
GPIOs are optional. Since commit 3e81a4ca51a1 ("Bluetooth: hci_bcm:
Mandate presence of shutdown and device wake GPIO") this driver
won't probe anymore on Raspberry Pi 3 and Zero W (no device wake GPIO
connected). So fix this regression by reverting this commit partially.
