tcp: revert F-RTO middle-box workaround

This reverts commit cc663f4d4c97b7297fb45135ab23cfd508b35a77. While fixing
some broken middle-boxes that modifies receive window fields, it does not
address middle-boxes that strip off SACK options. The best solution is
to fully revert this patch and the root F-RTO enhancement.
