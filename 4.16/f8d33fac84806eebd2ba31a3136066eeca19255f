crypto: skcipher - prevent using skciphers without setting key

Similar to what was done for the hash API, update the skcipher API to
track whether each transform has been keyed, and reject
encryption/decryption if a key is needed but one hasn't been set.

This isn't as important as the equivalent fix for the hash API because
symmetric ciphers almost always require a key (the "null cipher" is the
only exception), so are unlikely to be used without one.  Still,
tracking the key will prevent accidental unkeyed use.  algif_skcipher
also had to track the key anyway, so the new flag replaces that and
simplifies the algif_skcipher implementation.
