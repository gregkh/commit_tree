fs/dcache: Use release-acquire for name/length update

The code in __d_alloc() carefully orders filling in the NUL character
of the name (and the length, hash, and the name itself) with assigning
of the name itself.  However, prepend_name() does not order the accesses
to the ->name and ->len fields, other than on TSO systems.  This commit
therefore replaces prepend_name()'s READ_ONCE() of ->name with an
smp_load_acquire(), which orders against the subsequent READ_ONCE() of
->len.  Because READ_ONCE() now incorporates smp_read_barrier_depends(),
prepend_name()'s smp_read_barrier_depends() is removed.  Finally,
to save a line, the smp_wmb()/store pair in __d_alloc() is replaced
by smp_store_release().
