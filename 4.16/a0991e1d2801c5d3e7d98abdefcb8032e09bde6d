drm/i915/guc: Split guc_wq_item_append

We're using a special preempt context for HW to preempt into. We don't
want to emit any requests there, but we still need to wrap this context
into a valid GuC work item.
Let's cleanup the functions operating on GuC work items.
We can extract guc_request_add - responsible for adding GuC work item and
ringing the doorbell, and guc_wq_item_append - used by the function
above, not tied to the concept of gem request.
