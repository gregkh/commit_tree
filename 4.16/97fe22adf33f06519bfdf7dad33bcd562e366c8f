selftests/ftrace: Add some missing glob checks

Al Viro discovered a bug in the glob ftrace filtering code where "*a*b" is
treated the same as "a*b", and functions that would be selected by "*a*b"
but not "a*b" are not selected with "*a*b".

Add tests for patterns "*a*b" and "a*b*" to the glob selftest.
