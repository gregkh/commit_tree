net: separate SIOCGIFCONF handling from dev_ioctl()

Only two of dev_ioctl() callers may pass SIOCGIFCONF to it.
Separating that codepath from the rest of dev_ioctl() allows both
to simplify dev_ioctl() itself (all other cases work with struct ifreq *)
*and* seriously simplify the compat side of that beast: all it takes
is passing to inet_gifconf() an extra argument - the size of individual
records (sizeof(struct ifreq) or sizeof(struct compat_ifreq)).  With
dev_ifconf() called directly from sock_do_ioctl()/compat_dev_ifconf()
that's easy to arrange.

As the result, compat side of SIOCGIFCONF doesn't need any
allocations, copy_in_user() back and forth, etc.
