drm/amdgpu:fix gpu recover missing skipping(v2)

if app close CTX right after IB submit, gpu recover
will fail to find out the entity behind this guilty
job thus lead to no job skipping for this guilty job.

to fix this corner case just move the increasement of
job->karma out of the entity iteration.

v2:
only do karma increasment if bad->s_priority != KERNEL
because we always consider KERNEL job be correct and always
want to recover an unfinished kernel job (sometimes kernel
job is interrupted by VF FLR or other GPU hang event)
