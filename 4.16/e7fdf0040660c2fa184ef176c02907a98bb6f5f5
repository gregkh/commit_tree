gfs2: Remove minor gfs2_journaled_truncate inefficiencies

First, this function truncates the file in chunks.  When the original
file size isn't block aligned, each chunk that is truncated will remain
be misaligned.  This is inefficient.

Second, this function doesn't recognize where holes are, so it loops
through them.  For each chunk of a hole, it creates a new transaction.
At least avoid creating another transactions whe the current one is
still empty.  (An better fix would be to skip large holes, of course.)
