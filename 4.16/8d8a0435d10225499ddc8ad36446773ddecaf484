usb: renesas_usbhs: add usbhs_pipe_clear_without_sequence() function

This patch adds usbhs_pipe_clear_without_sequence() function.
The controller has the pipe buffer and the PIPEnCTR.ACLRM can clear
it completely. But, it's also clear the data sequence. So, the driver
needs to get the sequence before.
