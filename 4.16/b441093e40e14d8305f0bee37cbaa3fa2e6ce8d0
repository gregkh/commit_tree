drm/amdkfd: Ignore ACPI CRAT for non-APU systems

Some AMD motherboards without an APU have a broken CRAT table which
causes KFD initialization failures or incorrect information about
NUMA nodes, CPU cores or system memory. Ignore CRAT tables without
GPUs and rely on KFD's code to create a CRAT table for the CPU.
