drm/amd/display: Fix memleaks when atomic check fails.

While checking plane states for updates during atomic check, we create
dc_plane_states in preparation. These dc states should be freed if
something errors.

Although the input transfer function is also freed by
dc_plane_state_release(), we should free it (on error) under the same
scope as where it is created.
