signal: Ensure generic siginfos the kernel sends have all bits initialized

Call clear_siginfo to ensure stack allocated siginfos are fully
initialized before being passed to the signal sending functions.

This ensures that if there is the kind of confusion documented by
TRAP_FIXME, FPE_FIXME, or BUS_FIXME the kernel won't send unitialized
data to userspace when the kernel generates a signal with SI_USER but
the copy to userspace assumes it is a different kind of signal, and
different fields are initialized.

This also prepares the way for turning copy_siginfo_to_user
into a copy_to_user, by removing the need in many cases to perform
a field by field copy simply to skip the uninitialized fields.
