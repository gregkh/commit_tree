kconfig: Don't leak 'source' filenames during parsing

The 'source_stmt' nonterminal takes a 'prompt', which consists of either
a T_WORD or a T_WORD_QUOTE, both of which are always allocated on the
heap in zconf.l and need to have their associated strings freed. Free
them.

The existing code already makes sure to always copy the string, but add
a warning to sym_expand_string_value() to make it clear that the string
must be copied, just in case.

Summary from Valgrind on 'menuconfig' (ARCH=x86) before the fix:

	LEAK SUMMARY:
	   definitely lost: 387,504 bytes in 15,545 blocks
