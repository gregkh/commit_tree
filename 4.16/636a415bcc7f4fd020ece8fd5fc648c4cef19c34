parisc: Reduce irq overhead when run in qemu

When run under QEMU, calling mfctl(16) creates some overhead because the
qemu timer has to be scaled and moved into the register. This patch
reduces the number of calls to mfctl(16) by moving the calls out of the
loops.

Additionally, increase the minimal time interval to 8000 cycles instead
of 500 to compensate possible QEMU delays when delivering interrupts.
