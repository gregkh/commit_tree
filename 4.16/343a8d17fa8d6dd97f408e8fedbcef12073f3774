cpufreq: scpi: remove arm_big_little dependency

The dependency on physical_package_id from the topology to get the
cluster identifier is wrong. The concept of cluster used in ARM topology
is unfortunately not well defined in the architecture, we should avoid
using it. Further the frequency domain need not be mapped to so called
"clusters" one to one.

SCPI already provides means to obtain the frequency domain id from the
device tree. In order to support some new topologies(e.g. DSU which
contains 2 frequency domains within the physical cluster), pseudo
clusters are created to make this driver work which is wrong again.

In order to solve those issues and also remove dependency of topological
physical id for frequency domain, this patch removes the arm_big_little
dependency from scpi driver.
