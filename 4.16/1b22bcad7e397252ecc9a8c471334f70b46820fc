tipc: correct initial value for group congestion flag

In commit 60c253069632 ("tipc: fix race between poll() and
setsockopt()") we introduced a pointer from struct tipc_group to the
'group_is_connected' flag in struct tipc_sock, so that this field can
be checked without dereferencing the group pointer of the latter struct.

The initial value for this flag is correctly set to 'false' when a
group is created, but we miss the case when no group is created at
all, in which case the initial value should be 'true'. This has the
effect that SOCK_RDM/DGRAM sockets sending datagrams never receive
POLLOUT if they request so.

This commit corrects this bug.
