perf test bpf: Hook on epoll_pwait()

The 'perf test bpf' was hooking a eBPF program on the SyS_epoll_wait()
kernel function, that was what the epoll_wait() glibc function ended up
calling, but since at least glibc 2.26, the one that comes with, for
instance, Fedora 27, glibc ends up calling SyS_epoll_pwait() when
epoll_wait() is used, causing this 'perf test' entry to fail.

So switch to using epoll_pwait() and hook the eBPF program to the
SyS_epoll_pwait() kernel function to make it work on a wider range of
glibc and kernel versions.
