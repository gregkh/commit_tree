scsi: qla2xxx: Fix memory leak in dual/target mode

When driver is loaded in Target/Dual mode, it creates QPair to support
MQ and allocates resources for each QPair. This Qpair initialization is
delayed until the FW personality is changed to Dual/Target mode by
issuing chip reset. At the time of chip reset firmware is re-initilized
in correct personality all the QPairs are initialized by sending
MBC_INITIALIZE_MULTIQ (001Fh).

This patch fixes memory leak by adding check to issue
MBC_INITIALIZE_MULTIQ command only while deleting rsp/req queue when the
flag is set for initiator mode, and clean up QPair resources correctly
during the driver unload. This MBX does not need to be issued for
Target/Dual mode because chip reset will reset ISP.
