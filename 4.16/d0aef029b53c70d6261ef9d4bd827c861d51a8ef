net: ethernet: ti: ale: disable ale from stop()

ALE is enabled from cpsw_ale_start() now, but disabled only from
cpsw_ale_destroy() which introduces inconsitance as cpsw_ale_start() is
called when netif[s] is opened, but cpsw_ale_destroy() is called when
driver is removed. Hence, move ALE disabling in cpsw_ale_stop().
