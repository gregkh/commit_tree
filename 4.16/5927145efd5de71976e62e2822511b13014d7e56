x86/cpu: Remove the CONFIG_X86_PPRO_FENCE=y quirk

There were only a few Pentium Pro multiprocessors systems where this
errata applied. They are more than 20 years old now, and we've slowly
dropped places which put the workarounds in and discouraged anyone
from enabling the workaround.

Get rid of it for good.
