ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Refresh sysfs during hdmi device probe

All nodes of hdmi codec widgets are not updated in sysfs interface
(/sys/bus/hdaudio/devices/<dev>/widgets/) as the vendor widget is not
programmed to enable all the converters and pins during init. So,
refresh the sysfs widget interface after enabling all pins and
converters.
