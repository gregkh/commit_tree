Documentation: security/credentials.rst: explain need to sort group_list

This patch updates the documentation with the observations that led
to commit bdcf0a423ea1 ("kernel: make groups_sort calling a
responsibility group_info allocators") and the new behaviour required.
Specifically that groups_sort() should be called on a new group_list
before set_groups() or set_current_groups() is called.
