btrfs: make btrfs_free_stale_devices() to match the path

The btrfs_free_stale_devices() is updated to match for the given device
path and delete it. (It searches for only unmounted list of devices.)
Also drop the comment about different path being used for the same
device, since now we will have cli to clean any device that's not a
concern any more.
