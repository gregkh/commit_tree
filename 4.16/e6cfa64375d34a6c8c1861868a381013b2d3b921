clk: ingenic: Fix recalc_rate for clocks with fixed divider

Previously, the clocks with a fixed divider would report their rate
as being the same as the one of their parent, independently of the
divider in use. This commit fixes this behaviour.

This went unnoticed as neither the jz4740 nor the jz4780 CGU code
have clocks with fixed dividers yet.
