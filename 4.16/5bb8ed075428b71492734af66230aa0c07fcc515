rtnetlink: enable IFLA_IF_NETNSID for RTM_NEWLINK

- Backwards Compatibility:
  If userspace wants to determine whether RTM_NEWLINK supports the
  IFLA_IF_NETNSID property they should first send an RTM_GETLINK request
  with IFLA_IF_NETNSID on lo. If either EACCESS is returned or the reply
  does not include IFLA_IF_NETNSID userspace should assume that
  IFLA_IF_NETNSID is not supported on this kernel.
  If the reply does contain an IFLA_IF_NETNSID property userspace
  can send an RTM_NEWLINK with a IFLA_IF_NETNSID property. If they receive
  EOPNOTSUPP then the kernel does not support the IFLA_IF_NETNSID property
  with RTM_NEWLINK. Userpace should then fallback to other means.

- Security:
  Callers must have CAP_NET_ADMIN in the owning user namespace of the
  target network namespace.
