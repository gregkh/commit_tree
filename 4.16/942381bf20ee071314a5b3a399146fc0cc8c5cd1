staging: lustre: Add identifier names to function declarations

Checkpatch was complaining about missing identifier names in function
declarations. So we added the missing names according to the names in
the respective function implementation. *obd_import* was sometimes named
*import* and sometimes *imp* (in genops.c), so to avoid confusion we just
named it imp everywhere.
