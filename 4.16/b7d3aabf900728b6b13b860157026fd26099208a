drm/i915/pmu: Hide the (unsigned long)ptr cast

We pretend the PMU config id is a pointer value when encoding it into
the device parameters for presentation via sysfs. This requires casting
of an unsigned long into and out of the pointer member, which annoys
smatch:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_pmu.c:684 i915_pmu_event_show() warn: argument 3 to %lx specifier is cast from pointer

Instead of abusing a generic dev_ext_attribute, define our own typesafe
attributes.
