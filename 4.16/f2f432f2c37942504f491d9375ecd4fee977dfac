net: hns3: Refactors the requested reset & pending reset handling code

In exisiting code, the way to detect if driver/client reset should
be executed or if hardware should be be soft resetted was overly
complex.

Existing code use to read the interrupt status register from task
context to figure out if the interrupt source event was reset and
then use clear the interrupt source for reset while waiting for the
hardware to finish the reset. This behaviour again was confusing
and overly complex in terms of the flow.

This patch simplifies the handling of the requested reset and the
pending reset(i.e. reset which have already been asserted by the
software and hardware has acknowledged back to driver that it is
processing the hardware reset through interrupt)
