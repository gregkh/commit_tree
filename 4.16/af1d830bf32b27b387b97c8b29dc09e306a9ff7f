jump_label: Fix sparc64 warning

The kbuild test robot reported the following warning on sparc64:

  kernel/jump_label.c: In function '__jump_label_update':
  kernel/jump_label.c:376:51: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
       WARN_ONCE(1, "can't patch jump_label at %pS", (void *)entry->code);

On sparc64, the jump_label entry->code field is of type u32, but
pointers are 64-bit.  Silence the warning by casting entry->code to an
unsigned long before casting it to a pointer.  This is also what the
sparc jump label code does.
