afs: convert to new i_version API

For AFS, it's generally treated as an opaque value, so we use the
*_raw variants of the API here.

Note that AFS has quite a different definition for this counter. AFS
only increments it on changes to the data to the data in regular files
and contents of the directories. Inode metadata changes do not result
in a version increment.

We'll need to reconcile that somehow if we ever want to present this to
userspace via statx.
