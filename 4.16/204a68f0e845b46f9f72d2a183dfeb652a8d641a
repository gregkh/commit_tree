staging: android: Remove redundant license text

Now that the SPDX tag is in all android files, that identifies the
license in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the extra GPL text
wording can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.

This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
needed.

No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.
