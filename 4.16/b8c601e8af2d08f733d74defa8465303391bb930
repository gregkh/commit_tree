media: v4l2-compat-ioctl32.c: fix ctrl_is_pointer

ctrl_is_pointer just hardcoded two known string controls, but that
caused problems when using e.g. custom controls that use a pointer
for the payload.

Reimplement this function: it now finds the v4l2_ctrl (if the driver
uses the control framework) or it calls vidioc_query_ext_ctrl (if the
driver implements that directly).

In both cases it can now check if the control is a pointer control
or not.
