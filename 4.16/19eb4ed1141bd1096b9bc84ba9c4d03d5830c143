Input: synaptics - reset the ABS_X/Y fuzz after initializing MT axes

input_mt_init_slots() resets the ABS_X/Y fuzz to 0 and expects the driver
to call input_mt_report_pointer_emulation(). That is based on the MT
position bits which are already defuzzed - hence a fuzz of 0.

In the case of synaptics semi-mt devices, we report the ABS_X/Y axes
manually.  This results in the MT position being defuzzed but the
single-touch emulation missing that defuzzing.

Work around this by re-initializing the ABS_X/Y axes after the MT axis to
get the same fuzz value back.
