pinctrl: axp209: dereference pointer after it's been set

The number of GPIOs is gotten from a field within the structure
referenced in the of_device.data but it was actually read before it was
retrieved, thus it was dereferencing a null pointer.

Set the number of GPIOs after retrieving of_device.data.
