drm: Fix PANEL_ORIENTATION_QUIRKS breaking the Kconfig DRM menuconfig

All Kconfig menu menu entries should have a depends on MENU_OPTION, the
menu stops after the first Kconfig entry without this depends on.

Since the PANEL_ORIENTATION_QUIRKS option is also used outside of DRM,
it deliberately does not have a depends on DRM, but this causes all
items after it to show as separate items rather then under the DRM
menuconfig.

This commit moves PANEL_ORIENTATION_QUIRKS to the end of the drm Kconfig
file, grouping it with DRM_LIB_RANDOM which also does not depend on DRM,
fixing the DRM menuconfig.
