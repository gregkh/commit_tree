drm/vc4: Use .pixel_order instead of custom .flip_cbcr

The hardware has enums for altering the Cr and Cb order,
so use this instead of having a flag which swaps the
order the pointers are presented to the hardware
(that only worked for 3 plane formats anyway).

Explicitly sets .pixel_order in each case, rather than
relying on then default XYCBCR order being a value 0.
