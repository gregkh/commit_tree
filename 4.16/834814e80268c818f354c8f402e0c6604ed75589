Revert: "vfio-pci: Mask INTx if a device is not capabable of enabling it"

This reverts commit 2170dd04316e0754cbbfa4892a25aead39d225f7

The intent of commit 2170dd04316e ("vfio-pci: Mask INTx if a device is
not capabable of enabling it") was to disallow the user from seeing
that the device supports INTx if the platform is incapable of enabling
it.  The detection of this case however incorrectly includes devices
which natively do not support INTx, such as SR-IOV VFs, and further
discussions reveal gaps even for the target use case.
