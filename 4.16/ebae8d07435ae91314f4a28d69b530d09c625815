drm/tegra: dc: Implement legacy blending

This implements alpha blending on legacy display controllers (Tegra20,
Tegra30 and Tegra114). While it's theoretically possible to support the
zpos property to enable userspace to specify the Z-order of each plane
individually, this is not currently supported and the same fixed Z-
order as previously defined is used.

Reverts commit 71835caa00e8 ("drm/tegra: fb: Force alpha formats") since
the opaque formats are now supported.
