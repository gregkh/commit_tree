openrisc: Fix conflicting types for _exext and _stext

The printk tree in linux-next has a patch "symbol lookup: introduce
dereference_symbol_descriptor()" that includes sections.h in kallsyms.h,
so arch/openrisc/kernel/traps.c gets a second extern definition for
_etext and _stext.

Remove the local definitions and include sections.h directly in
preparation for the kallsyms.h change.

This fixes the following (future) build error:

  CC      arch/openrisc/kernel/traps.o
arch/openrisc/kernel/traps.c:43:13: error: conflicting types for ‘_etext’
