spi: orion: Fix clock resource by adding an optional bus clock

On Armada 7K/8K we need to explicitly enable the bus clock. The bus clock
is optional because not all the SoCs need them but at least for Armada
7K/8K it is actually mandatory.

The binding documentation is updating accordingly as well as mentioning
the mandatory clock which was also missing.
