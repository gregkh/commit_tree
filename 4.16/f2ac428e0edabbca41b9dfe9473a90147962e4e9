powerpc/pseries/cpuidle: add polling idle for shared processor guests

For shared processor guests (e.g., KVM), add an idle polling mode rather
than immediately returning to the hypervisor when the guest CPU goes
idle.

Test setup is a 2 socket POWER9 with 4 guests running, each with vCPUs
equal to 1/2 of real of CPUs. Saturated each guest with tbench. Using
polling idle gives about 1.4x throughput.

Kernel compile speed was not changed significantly.
