MIPS: Push ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_SERIO down to platform level

Maybe once upon a time the select of ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_SERIO used to
make sense.  These days MIPS platforms long have done away with i8042 or
PS/2 style keyboard and mouse ports and embedded systems probably never
had them anyway so push the select down to the level of individual
platforms.
