btrfs: drop get_extent from extent_page_data

Previous patches cleaned up all places where
extent_page_data::get_extent was set and it was btrfs_get_extent all the
time, so we can simply call that instead.

This also reduces size of extent_page_data by 8 bytes which has positive
effect on stack consumption on various functions on the write out path.
