btrfs: cleanup unnecessary string dup in btrfs_parse_options()

Long ago, commit edf24abe51493 ("btrfs: sanity mount option parsing and
early mount code") split the btrfs_parse_options() into two parts
(btrfs_parse_early_options() and btrfs_parse_options()). As a result,
btrfs_parse_optins no longer gets called twice and is the last one to
parse mount option string. Therefore there is no need to dup it.
