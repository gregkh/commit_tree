jump_label: Disable jump labels in __exit code

With the following commit:

  333522447063 ("jump_label: Explicitly disable jump labels in __init code")

... we explicitly disabled jump labels in __init code, so they could be
detected and not warned about in the following commit:

  dc1dd184c2f0 ("jump_label: Warn on failed jump_label patching attempt")

In-kernel __exit code has the same issue.  It's never used, so it's
freed along with the rest of initmem.  But jump label entries in __exit
code aren't explicitly disabled, so we get the following warning when
enabling pr_debug() in __exit code:

  can't patch jump_label at dmi_sysfs_exit+0x0/0x2d
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 22572 at kernel/jump_label.c:376 __jump_label_update+0x9d/0xb0

Fix the warning by disabling all jump labels in initmem (which includes
both __init and __exit code).
