video: udlfb: Switch from the pr_*() to the dev_*() logging functions

Use dev_err() and dev_info() instead of pr_err() and pr_info().
USB device is used as argument to dev_*() functions for probe
and urb manipulation, FB device for framebuffer related info.

Also noisy device probe output was partly removed as idVendor,
idProduct, name and serial are already printed by usb core,
and partly turned into debug output.
