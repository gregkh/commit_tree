mn10300: READ_ONCE() now implies smp_read_barrier_depends()

Given that READ_ONCE() now implies smp_read_barrier_depends(),
there is no need for the open-coded smp_read_barrier_depends() in
mn10300_serial_receive_interrupt() and mn10300_serial_poll_get_char().
This commit therefore removes them, but replaces them with comments
calling out that carrying dependencies through non-pointers is quite
dangerous.  Compilers simply know too much about integers.
