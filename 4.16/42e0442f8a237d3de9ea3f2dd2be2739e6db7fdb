media: rc: move ir-lirc-codec.c contents into lirc_dev.c

Since removing the lirc kapi, ir-lirc-codec.c only contains lirc fops
so the file name is no longer correct. By moving its content into
lirc_dev.c the ugly extern struct lirc_fops is not longer needed,
and everything lirc related is in one file.
