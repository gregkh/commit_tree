tracing: Fix parsing of globs with a wildcard at the beginning

Al Viro reported:

    For substring - sure, but what about something like "*a*b" and "a*b"?
    AFAICS, filter_parse_regex() ends up with identical results in both
    cases - MATCH_GLOB and *search = "a*b".  And no way for the caller
    to tell one from another.

Testing this with the following:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 # echo '*raw*lock' > set_ftrace_filter
 bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

With this patch:

 # echo '*raw*lock' > set_ftrace_filter
 # cat set_ftrace_filter
_raw_read_trylock
_raw_write_trylock
_raw_read_unlock
_raw_spin_unlock
_raw_write_unlock
_raw_spin_trylock
_raw_spin_lock
_raw_write_lock
_raw_read_lock

Al recommended not setting the search buffer to skip the first '*' unless we
know we are not using MATCH_GLOB. This implements his suggested logic.
