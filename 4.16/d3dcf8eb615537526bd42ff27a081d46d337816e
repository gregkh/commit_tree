rhashtable: Fix rhlist duplicates insertion

When inserting duplicate objects (those with the same key),
current rhlist implementation messes up the chain pointers by
updating the bucket pointer instead of prev next pointer to the
newly inserted node. This causes missing elements on removal and
travesal.

Fix that by properly updating pprev pointer to point to
the correct rhash_head next pointer.
