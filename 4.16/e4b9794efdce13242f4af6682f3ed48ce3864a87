scsi: lpfc: Fix crash after bad bar setup on driver attachment

In test cases where an instance of the driver is detached and
reattached, the driver will crash on reattachment. There is a compound
if statement that will skip over the bar setup if the pci_resource_start
call is not successful. The driver erroneously returns success to its
bar setup in this scenario even though the bars aren't properly
configured.

Rework the offending code segment for proper initialization steps.  If
the pci_resource_start call fails, -ENOMEM is now returned.
