ARM: dts: Update ti-sysc data for existing users

Let's update the existing users with features and clock data as
specified in the binding. This is currently the smartreflex for most
part, and also few omap4 modules with no child device driver like
mcasp, abe iss and gfx.

Note that we had few mistakes that did not get noticed as we're still
probing the SmartReflex driver with legacy platform data and using
"ti,hwmods" legacy property for ti-sysc driver.

So let's fix the omap4 and dra7 smartreflex registers as there is no
no revision register.

And on omap4, the mcasp module has a revision register according to
the TRM.

And for omap34xx we need a different configuration compared to 36xx.
And the smartreflex on 3517 we've always kept disabled so let's
remove any references to it.
