KVM: arm/arm64: Support a vgic interrupt line level sample function

The GIC sometimes need to sample the physical line of a mapped
interrupt.  As we know this to be notoriously slow, provide a callback
function for devices (such as the timer) which can do this much faster
than talking to the distributor, for example by comparing a few
in-memory values.  Fall back to the good old method of poking the
physical GIC if no callback is provided.
