netfilter: flowtable infrastructure depends on NETFILTER_INGRESS

config NF_FLOW_TABLE depends on NETFILTER_INGRESS. If users forget to
enable this toggle, flowtable registration fails with EOPNOTSUPP.

Moreover, turn 'select NF_FLOW_TABLE' in every flowtable family flavour
into dependency instead, otherwise this new dependency on
NETFILTER_INGRESS causes a warning. This also allows us to remove the
explicit dependency between family flowtables <-> NF_TABLES and
NF_CONNTRACK, given they depend on the NF_FLOW_TABLE core that already
expresses the general dependencies for this new infrastructure.

Moreover, NF_FLOW_TABLE_INET depends on NF_FLOW_TABLE_IPV4 and
NF_FLOWTABLE_IPV6, which already depends on NF_FLOW_TABLE. So we can get
rid of direct dependency with NF_FLOW_TABLE.

In general, let's avoid 'select', it just makes things more complicated.
