hwrng: core - Clean up RNG list when last hwrng is unregistered

Commit 142a27f0a731 added support for a "best" RNG, and in doing so
introduced a hang from rmmod/modprobe -r when the last RNG on the list
was unloaded.

When the hwrng list is depleted, return the global variables to their
original state and decrement all references to the object.
