ixgbe: Fix interaction between SR-IOV and macvlan offload

When SR-IOV was enabled the macvlan offload was configuring several filters
with the wrong pool value. This would result in the macvlan interfaces not
being able to receive traffic that had to pass over the physical interface.

To fix it wrap the pool argument in the VMDQ_P macro which will add the
necessary offset to get to the actual VMDq pool
