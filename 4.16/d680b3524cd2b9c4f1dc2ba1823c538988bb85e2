net: sched: silence uninitialized parent variable warning in tc_dump_tfilter

When tcm->tcm_ifindex == TCM_IFINDEX_MAGIC_BLOCK, parent is still passed
down but the value is never used. Compiler does not recognize it and
issues a warning. Silence it down initializing parent to 0.

Fixes: 7960d1daf278 ("net: sched: use block index as a handle instead of qdisc when block is shared")
