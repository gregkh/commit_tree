dm: optimize bio-based NVMe IO submission

Upper level bio-based drivers that stack immediately ontop of NVMe can
leverage direct_make_request().  In addition DM's NVMe bio-based
will initially only ever have one NVMe device that it submits IO to at a
time.  There is no splitting needed.  Enhance DM core so that
DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED's IO submission takes advantage of both of these
characteristics.
