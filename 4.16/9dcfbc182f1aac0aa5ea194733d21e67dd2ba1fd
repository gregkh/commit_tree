drm/msm: Fix NULL deref in adreno_load_gpu

The msm/kms driver should work even if there is no GPU device specified
in DT. Currently, we get a NULL dereference crash in adreno_load_gpu
since the driver assumes that priv->gpu_pdev is non-NULL.

Perform an additional check on priv->gpu_pdev before trying to retrieve
the msm_gpu pointer from it.

v2: Incorporate Jordan's comments:
- Simplify the check to share the same error message.
- Use dev_err_once() to avoid an error message every time we open the
  drm device fd.
