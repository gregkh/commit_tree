dm raid: display a consistent copy of the MD status via raid_status()

The MD sync thread updates recovery flags providing state of any
running, idle, frozen, recovering, reshaping, ... activity it performs
and updates respective flags asynchronously versus dm processing
raid_status().  To close that race window, take a single copy of the
flags and pass it into its callees.
