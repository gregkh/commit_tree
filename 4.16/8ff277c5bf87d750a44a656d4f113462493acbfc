ACPI / bus: Remove checks in acpi_get_match_data()

As well as its sibling of_device_get_match_data() has no such checks,
no need to do it in acpi_get_match_data().

First of all, we are not supposed to call fwnode API like this without
driver attached.

Second, since __acpi_match_device() does check input parameter there is
no need to duplicate it outside.

And last but not least one, the API should still serve the cases when
ACPI device is enumerated via PRP0001. In such case driver has neither
ACPI table nor driver data there.
