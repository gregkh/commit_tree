scsi: megaraid_sas: Do not use 32-bit atomic request descriptor for Ventura controllers

Problem Statement: Sending I/O through 32 bit descriptors to Ventura series of
controller results in IO timeout on certain conditions.

This error only occurs on systems with high I/O activity on Ventura series
controllers.

Changes in this patch will prevent driver from using 32 bit descriptor and use
64 bit Descriptors.
