dmaengine: qcom_hidma: simplify DT resource parsing

The hidma driver open codes populating address and IRQ resources from DT.
We have standard functions of_address_to_resource and of_irq_to_resource
for this, so use them instead.

The DT binding states each child should have 2 addresses and 1 IRQ, so we
can simplify the logic and do a fixed size resource allocation. Using the
standard of_address_to_resource will also do any address translation which
was missing.
