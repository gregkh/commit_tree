dt-bindings: mvebu-uart: update documentation with extended UART

Update the device tree binding documentation for the Marvell EBU UART,
in order to allow describing the extended UART IP block, in addition to
the already supported standard UART IP. This requires adding a new
compatible string, the introduction of a clocks property, and extensions
to the interrupts property.
