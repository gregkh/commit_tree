media: videobuf2: Add new uAPI for DVB streaming I/O

Adds a new uAPI for DVB to use streaming I/O which is implemented
based on videobuf2, using those new ioctls:

- DMX_REQBUFS:  Request kernel to allocate buffers which count and size
	        are dedicated by user.
- DMX_QUERYBUF: Get the buffer information like a memory offset which
		will mmap() and be shared with user-space.
- DMX_EXPBUF:   Just for testing whether buffer-exporting success or not.
- DMX_QBUF:     Pass the buffer to kernel-space.
- DMX_DQBUF:    Get back the buffer which may contain TS data.

The original patch was written before merging VB2-core functionalities
upstream. When such series was added, several adjustments were made,
fixing some issues with	V4L2, causing the original patch to be
non-trivially rebased.

After rebased, a few bugs in the patch were fixed. The patch was
also enhanced it and polling functionality got added.

The main changes over the original patch are:

dvb_vb2_fill_buffer():
	- Set the size of the outgoing buffer after while loop using
	  vb2_set_plane_payload;

	- Added NULL check for source buffer as per normal convention
	  of demux driver, this is called twice, first time with valid
	  buffer second time with NULL pointer, if its not handled,
	  it will result in  crash

	- Restricted spinlock for only list_* operations

dvb_vb2_init():
	- Restricted q->io_modes to only VB2_MMAP as its the only
	  supported mode

dvb_vb2_release():
	- Replaced the && in if condiion with &, because otherwise
	  it was always getting satisfied.

dvb_vb2_stream_off():
	- Added list_del code for enqueud buffers upon stream off

dvb_vb2_poll():
	- Added this new function in order to support polling

dvb_demux_poll() and dvb_dvr_poll()
	- dvb_vb2_poll() is now called from these functions

- Ported this patch and latest videobuf2 to lower kernel versions and
  tested auto scan.
