dma-direct: rename dma_noop to dma_direct

The trivial direct mapping implementation already does a virtual to
physical translation which isn't strictly a noop, and will soon learn
to do non-direct but linear physical to dma translations through the
device offset and a few small tricks.  Rename it to a better fitting
name.
