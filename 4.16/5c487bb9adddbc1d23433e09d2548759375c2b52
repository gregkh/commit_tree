tcp: tracepoint: only call trace_tcp_send_reset with full socket

tracepoint tcp_send_reset requires a full socket to work. However, it
may be called when in TCP_TIME_WAIT:

        case TCP_TW_RST:
                tcp_v6_send_reset(sk, skb);
                inet_twsk_deschedule_put(inet_twsk(sk));
                goto discard_it;

To avoid this problem, this patch checks the socket with sk_fullsock()
before calling trace_tcp_send_reset().
