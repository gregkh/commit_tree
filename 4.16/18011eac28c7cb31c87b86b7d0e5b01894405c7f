arm64: tls: Avoid unconditional zeroing of tpidrro_el0 for native tasks

When unmapping the kernel at EL0, we use tpidrro_el0 as a scratch register
during exception entry from native tasks and subsequently zero it in
the kernel_ventry macro. We can therefore avoid zeroing tpidrro_el0
in the context-switch path for native tasks using the entry trampoline.
