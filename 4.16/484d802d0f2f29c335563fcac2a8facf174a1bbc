net: systemport: Rewrite __bcm_sysport_tx_reclaim()

There is no need for complex checking between the last consumed index
and current consumed index, a simple subtraction will do.

This also eliminates the possibility of a permanent transmit queue stall
under the following conditions:

- one CPU bursts ring->size worth of traffic (up to 256 buffers), to the
  point where we run out of free descriptors, so we stop the transmit
  queue at the end of bcm_sysport_xmit()

- because of our locking, we have the transmit process disable
  interrupts which means we can be blocking the TX reclamation process

- when TX reclamation finally runs, we will be computing the difference
  between ring->c_index (last consumed index by SW) and what the HW
  reports through its register

- this register is masked with (ring->size - 1) = 0xff, which will lead
  to stripping the upper bits of the index (register is 16-bits wide)

- we will be computing last_tx_cn as 0, which means there is no work to
  be done, and we never wake-up the transmit queue, leaving it
  permanently disabled

A practical example is e.g: ring->c_index aka last_c_index = 12, we
pushed 256 entries, HW consumer index = 268, we mask it with 0xff = 12,
so last_tx_cn == 0, nothing happens.
