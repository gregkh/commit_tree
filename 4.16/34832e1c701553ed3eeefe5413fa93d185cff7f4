net: sched: prepare for reimplementation of tc_cls_common_offload_init()

Rename the tc_cls_common_offload_init() helper function to
tc_cls_common_offload_init_deprecated() and add a new implementation
which also takes flags argument.  We will only set extack if flags
indicate that offload is forced (skip_sw) otherwise driver errors
should be ignored, as they don't influence the overall filter
installation.

Note that we need the tc_skip_hw() helper for new version, therefore
it is added later in the file.
