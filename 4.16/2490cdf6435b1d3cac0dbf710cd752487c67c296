tee: shm: Potential NULL dereference calling tee_shm_register()

get_user_pages_fast() can return zero in certain error paths.  We should
handle that or else it means we accidentally return ERR_PTR(0) which is
NULL instead of an error pointer.  The callers are not expecting that
and will crash with a NULL dereference.
