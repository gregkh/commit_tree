dm: remove unused 'num_write_bios' target interface

No DM target provides num_write_bios and none has since dm-cache's
brief use in 2013.

Having the possibility of num_write_bios > 1 complicates bio
allocation.  So remove the interface and assume there is only one bio
needed.

If a target ever needs more, it must provide a suitable bioset and
allocate itself based on its particular needs.
