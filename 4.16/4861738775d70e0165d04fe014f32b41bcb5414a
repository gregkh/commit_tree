net: sched: introduce shared filter blocks infrastructure

Allow qdiscs to share filter blocks among them. Each qdisc type has to
use block get/put extended modifications that enable sharing.
Shared blocks are tracked within each net namespace and identified
by u32 index. This index is passed from user during the qdisc creation.
If user passes index that is not used by any other qdisc, new block
is created. If user passes index that is already used, the existing
block will be re-used.
