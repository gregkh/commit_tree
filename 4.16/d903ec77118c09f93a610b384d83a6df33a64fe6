gianfar: simplify FCS handling and fix memory leak

Previously, buffer descriptors containing only the frame check sequence
(FCS) were skipped and not added to the skb. However, the page reference
count was still incremented, leading to a memory leak.

Fixing this inside gfar_add_rx_frag() is difficult due to reserved
memory handling and page reuse. Instead, move the FCS handling to
gfar_process_frame() and trim off the FCS before passing the skb up the
networking stack.
