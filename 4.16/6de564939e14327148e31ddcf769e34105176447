mtdchar: fix usage of mtd_ooblayout_ecc()

Section was not properly computed. The value of OOB region definition is
always ECC section 0 information in the OOB area, but we want to get all
the ECC bytes information, so we should call
mtd_ooblayout_ecc(mtd, section++, &oobregion) until it returns -ERANGE.

Fixes: c2b78452a9db ("mtd: use mtd_ooblayout_xxx() helpers where appropriate")
