signal/blackfin: Move the blackfin specific si_codes to asm-generic/siginfo.h

Having si_codes in many different files simply encourages duplicate definitions
that can cause problems later.  To avoid that merge the blackfin specific si_codes
into uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h

Update copy_siginfo_to_user to copy with the absence of BUS_MCEERR_AR that blackfin
defines to be something else.
