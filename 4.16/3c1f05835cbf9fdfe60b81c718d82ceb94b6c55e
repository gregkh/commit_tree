objtool: Add Clang support

Since the ORC unwinder was made the default on x86_64, Clang-built
defconfig kernels have triggered some new objtool warnings:

  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gpu_error.o: warning: objtool: i915_error_printf()+0x6c: return with modified stack frame
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_display.o: warning: objtool: pipe_config_err()+0xa6: return with modified stack frame

The problem is that objtool has never seen clang-built binaries before.

Shockingly enough, objtool is apparently able to follow the code flow
mostly fine, except for one instruction sequence.  Instead of a LEAVE
instruction, clang restores RSP and RBP the long way:

   67c:   48 89 ec                mov    %rbp,%rsp
   67f:   5d                      pop    %rbp

Teach objtool about this new code sequence.
