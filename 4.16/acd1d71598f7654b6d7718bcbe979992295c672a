xfs: preserve i_rdev when recycling a reclaimable inode

Commit 66f364649d870 ("xfs: remove if_rdev") moved storing of rdev
value for special inodes to VFS inodes, but forgot to preserve the
value of i_rdev when recycling a reclaimable xfs_inode.

This was detected by xfstest overlay/017 with inodex=on mount option
and xfs base fs. The test does a lookup of overlay chardev and blockdev
right after drop caches.

Overlayfs inodes hold a reference on underlying xfs inodes when mount
option index=on is configured. If drop caches reclaim xfs inodes, before
it relclaims overlayfs inodes, that can sometimes leave a reclaimable xfs
inode and that test hits that case quite often.

When that happens, the xfs inode cache remains broken (zere i_rdev)
until the next cycle mount or drop caches.
