vhost: correctly remove wait queue during poll failure

We tried to remove vq poll from wait queue, but do not check whether
or not it was in a list before. This will lead double free. Fixing
this by switching to use vhost_poll_stop() which zeros poll->wqh after
removing poll from waitqueue to make sure it won't be freed twice.
