Btrfs: remove redundant btrfs_balance_delayed_items

In functions like btrfs_create(), we run both
btrfs_balance_delayed_items() and btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() after
the operation, but btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() is surely going to run
btrfs_balance_delayed_items().

This keeps only btrfs_btree_balance_dirty().
