KVM: Move vcpu_load to arch-specific kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl

Move the calls to vcpu_load() and vcpu_put() in to the architecture
specific implementations of kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl() which dispatches
further architecture-specific ioctls on to other functions.

Some architectures support asynchronous vcpu ioctls which cannot call
vcpu_load() or take the vcpu->mutex, because that would prevent
concurrent execution with a running VCPU, which is the intended purpose
of these ioctls, for example because they inject interrupts.

We repeat the separate checks for these specifics in the architecture
code for MIPS, S390 and PPC, and avoid taking the vcpu->mutex and
calling vcpu_load for these ioctls.
