PCI: designware-ep: Read-only registers need DBI_RO_WR_EN to be writable

Certain registers that pcie-designware-ep tries to write to are read-only
registers. However, these registers can become read/write if we first
enable the DBI_RO_WR_EN bit. Set/unset the DBI_RO_WR_EN bit before/after
writing these registers.
