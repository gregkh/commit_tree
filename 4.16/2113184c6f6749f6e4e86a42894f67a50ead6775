drm/i915: Pull the unconditional GPU cache invalidation into request construction

As the request will, in the following patch, implicitly invoke a
context-switch on construction, we should precede that with a GPU TLB
invalidation. Also, even before using GGTT, we always want to invalidate
the TLBs for any updates (as well as the ppgtt invalidates that are
unconditionally applied by execbuf). Since we almost always require the
TLB invalidate, do it unconditionally on request allocation and so we can
remove it from all other paths.
