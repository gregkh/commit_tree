dt-bindings: iio: adc: sd-modulator: fix io-channel-cells

io-channel-cells should be <0> since sigma delta modulator exports only
one channel, as described in ../iio/iio-bindings.txt "IIO providers"
section. Only the phandle is necessary for IIO consumers in this case.

Fixes: af11143757b7 ("IIO: Add DT bindings for sigma delta adc modulator")
