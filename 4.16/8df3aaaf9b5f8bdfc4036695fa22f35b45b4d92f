btree: avoid variable-length allocations

geo->keylen cannot be larger than 4.  So we might as well make
fixed-size allocations.

Given the one remaining user, geo->keylen cannot even be larger than 1.
Logfs used to have 64bit and 128bit keys, tcm_qla2xxx only has 32bit
keys.  But let's not break the code if we don't have to.
