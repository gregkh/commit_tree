KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix handling of secondary HPTEG in HPT resizing code

This fixes the computation of the HPTE index to use when the HPT
resizing code encounters a bolted HPTE which is stored in its
secondary HPTE group.  The code inverts the HPTE group number, which
is correct, but doesn't then mask it with new_hash_mask.  As a result,
new_pteg will be effectively negative, resulting in new_hptep
pointing before the new HPT, which will corrupt memory.

In addition, this removes two BUG_ON statements.  The condition that
the BUG_ONs were testing -- that we have computed the hash value
incorrectly -- has never been observed in testing, and if it did
occur, would only affect the guest, not the host.  Given that
BUG_ON should only be used in conditions where the kernel (i.e.
the host kernel, in this case) can't possibly continue execution,
it is not appropriate here.
