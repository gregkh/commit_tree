kprobes: Propagate error from disarm_kprobe_ftrace()

Improve error handling when disarming ftrace-based kprobes. Like with
arm_kprobe_ftrace(), propagate any errors from disarm_kprobe_ftrace() so
that we do not disable/unregister kprobes that are still armed. In other
words, unregister_kprobe() and disable_kprobe() should not report success
if the kprobe could not be disarmed.

disarm_all_kprobes() keeps its current behavior and attempts to
disarm all kprobes. It returns the last encountered error and gives a
warning if not all probes could be disarmed.

This patch is based on Petr Mladek's original patchset (patches 2 and 3)
back in 2015, which improved kprobes error handling, found here:

   https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/26/452

However, further work on this had been paused since then and the patches
were not upstreamed.
