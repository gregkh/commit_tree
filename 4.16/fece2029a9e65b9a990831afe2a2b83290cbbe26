mm/khugepaged.c: convert VM_BUG_ON() to collapse fail

khugepaged is not yet able to convert PTE-mapped huge pages back to PMD
mapped.  We do not collapse such pages.  See check
khugepaged_scan_pmd().

But if between khugepaged_scan_pmd() and __collapse_huge_page_isolate()
somebody managed to instantiate THP in the range and then split the PMD
back to PTEs we would have a problem --
VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PageCompound(page)) will get triggered.

It's possible since we drop mmap_sem during collapse to re-take for
write.

Replace the VM_BUG_ON() with graceful collapse fail.
