mm: add unmap_mapping_pages()

Several users of unmap_mapping_range() would prefer to express their
range in pages rather than bytes.  Unfortuately, on a 32-bit kernel, you
have to remember to cast your page number to a 64-bit type before
shifting it, and four places in the current tree didn't remember to do
that.  That's a sign of a bad interface.

Conveniently, unmap_mapping_range() actually converts from bytes into
pages, so hoist the guts of unmap_mapping_range() into a new function
unmap_mapping_pages() and convert the callers which want to use pages.
