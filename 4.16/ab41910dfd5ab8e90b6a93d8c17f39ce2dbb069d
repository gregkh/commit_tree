ARM: davinci: make davinci_soc_info structures const

Make davinci_soc_info structures const as they are either passed to the
function davinci_common_init having the argument as const or their field
cpu_clks of type struct clk_lookup * is passed to the function
davinci_clk_init.

So, the fields are never modified and the structures can be const.

Done using Coccinelle.
