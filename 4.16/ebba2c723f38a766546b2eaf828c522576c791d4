hrtimer: Make hrtimer_force_reprogramm() unconditionally available

hrtimer_force_reprogram() needs to be available unconditionally for softirq
based hrtimers. Move the function and all required struct members out of
the CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS #ifdef.

There is no functional change because hrtimer_force_reprogram() is only
invoked when hrtimer_cpu_base.hres_active is true and
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y.

Making it unconditional increases the text size for the
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=n case slightly, but avoids replication of that code
for the upcoming softirq based hrtimers support. Most of the code gets
eliminated in the CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=n case by the compiler.
