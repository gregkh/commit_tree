tun: setup xdp_rxq_info

Driver hook points for xdp_rxq_info:
 * reg  : tun_attach
 * unreg: __tun_detach

I've done some manual testing of this tun driver, but I would
appriciate good review and someone else running their use-case tests,
as I'm not 100% sure I understand the tfile->detached semantics.

V2: Removed the skb_array_cleanup() call from V1 by request from Jason Wang.
