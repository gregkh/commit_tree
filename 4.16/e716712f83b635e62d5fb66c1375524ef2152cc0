__get_user_pages_locked(): get rid of notify_drop argument

The only caller that doesn't pass true in it is get_user_pages() and
it passes NULL in locked.  The only place where we check it is
	if (notify_locked && lock_dropped && *locked)
and lock_dropped can become true only if we have locked != NULL.
In other words, the second part of condition will be false when
called by get_user_pages().

Just get rid of the argument and turn the condition into
	if (lock_dropped && *locked)
