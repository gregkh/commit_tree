iio: adc: stm32: fix scan of multiple channels with DMA

By default, watermark is set to '1'. Watermark is used to fine tune
cyclic dma buffer period. In case watermark is left untouched (e.g. 1)
and several channels are being scanned, buffer period is wrongly set
(e.g. to 1 sample). As a consequence, data is never pushed to upper layer.
Fix buffer period size, by taking scan channels number into account.
