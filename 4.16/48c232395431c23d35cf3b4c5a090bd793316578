kasan: remove redundant initialization of variable 'real_size'

Variable real_size is initialized with a value that is never read, it is
re-assigned a new value later on, hence the initialization is redundant
and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warning:

  lib/test_kasan.c:422:21: warning: Value stored to 'real_size' during its initialization is never read
