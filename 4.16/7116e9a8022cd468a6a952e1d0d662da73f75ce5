drm/tegra: dc: Support background color

Starting with Tegra124, the interface to set the background color (the
value generated for pixels that are not sourced from any window) is via
a different register. Earlier generations called this the border color.
Reverse the feature flag and assume that IP revisions that don't have
support for background color will support border color instead.
