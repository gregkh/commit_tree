Bluetooth: btusb: Restore QCA Rome suspend/resume fix with a "rewritten" version

Commit 7d06d5895c15 ("Revert "Bluetooth: btusb: fix QCA...suspend/resume"")
removed the setting of the BTUSB_RESET_RESUME quirk for QCA Rome devices,
instead favoring adding USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME quirks in usb/core/quirks.c.

This was done because the DIY BTUSB_RESET_RESUME reset-resume handling
has several issues (see the original commit message). An added advantage
of moving over to the USB-core reset-resume handling is that it also
disables autosuspend for these devices, which is similarly broken on these.

But there are 2 issues with this approach:
1) It leaves the broken DIY BTUSB_RESET_RESUME code in place for Realtek
   devices.
2) Sofar only 2 of the 10 QCA devices known to the btusb code have been
   added to usb/core/quirks.c and if we fix the Realtek case the same way
   we need to add an additional 14 entries. So in essence we need to
   duplicate a large part of the usb_device_id table in btusb.c in
   usb/core/quirks.c and manually keep them in sync.

This commit instead restores setting a reset-resume quirk for QCA devices
in the btusb.c code, avoiding the duplicate usb_device_id table problem.

This commit avoids the problems with the original DIY BTUSB_RESET_RESUME
code by simply setting the USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME quirk directly on the
usb_device.

This commit also moves the BTUSB_REALTEK case over to directly setting the
USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME on the usb_device and removes the now unused
BTUSB_RESET_RESUME code.
