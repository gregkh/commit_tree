ida: do zeroing in ida_pre_get()

As far as I can tell, the only place the per-cpu ida_bitmap is populated
is in ida_pre_get.  The pre-allocated element is stolen in two places in
ida_get_new_above, in both cases immediately followed by a memset(0).

Since ida_get_new_above is called with locks held, do the zeroing in
ida_pre_get, or rather let kmalloc() do it.  Also, apparently gcc
generates ~44 bytes of code to do a memset(, 0, 128):

  $ scripts/bloat-o-meter vmlinux.{0,1}
  add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 2/1 up/down: 5/-88 (-83)
  Function                                     old     new   delta
  ida_pre_get                                  115     119      +4
  vermagic                                      27      28      +1
  ida_get_new_above                            715     627     -88
