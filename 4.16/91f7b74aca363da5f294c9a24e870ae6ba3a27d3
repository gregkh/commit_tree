DAC960: split up ioctl function to reduce stack size

When CONFIG_KASAN is set, all the local variables in this function are
allocated on the stack together, leading to a warning about possible
kernel stack overflow:

drivers/block/DAC960.c: In function 'DAC960_gam_ioctl':
drivers/block/DAC960.c:7061:1: error: the frame size of 2240 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

By splitting up the function into smaller chunks, we can avoid that and
make the code slightly more readable at the same time. The coding style
in this file is completely nonstandard, and I chose to not touch that
at all, leaving the unconventional intendation unchanged to make it
easier to review the diff.
