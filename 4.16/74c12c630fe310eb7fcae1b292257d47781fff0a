batman-adv: Fix multicast packet loss with a single WANT_ALL_IPV4/6 flag

As the kernel doc describes too the code is supposed to skip adding
multicast TT entries if both the WANT_ALL_IPV4 and WANT_ALL_IPV6 flags
are present.

Unfortunately, the current code even skips adding multicast TT entries
if only either the WANT_ALL_IPV4 or WANT_ALL_IPV6 is present.

This could lead to IPv6 multicast packet loss if only an IGMP but not an
MLD querier is present for instance or vice versa.
