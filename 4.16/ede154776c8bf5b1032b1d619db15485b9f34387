bpf: sockmap put client sockets in blocking mode

Put client sockets in blocking mode otherwise with sendmsg tests
its easy to overrun the socket buffers which results in the test
being aborted.

The original non-blocking was added to handle listen/accept with
a single thread the client/accepted sockets do not need to be
non-blocking.
