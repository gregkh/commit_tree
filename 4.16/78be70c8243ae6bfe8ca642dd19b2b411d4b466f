serial: max310x: Support IRQ sharing with other devices

According to my chip's datasheet [1], the IRQ output is an open
collector pin which is suitable for sharing with other chips. The chip
also has a register which indicates which UART performed a change and
the driver checks that register already, so we have everything what is
needed to effectively share the IRQ GPIO.
