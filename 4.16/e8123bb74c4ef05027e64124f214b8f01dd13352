ath10k: add per peer tx stats support for 10.2.4

10.2.4 firmware branch (used in QCA988X) does not support
HTT_10_4_T2H_MSG_TYPE_PEER_STATS and that's why ath10k does not provide
tranmission rate statistics to user space, instead it just shows
hardcoded 6 Mbit/s. But pktlog firmware facility provides per peer tx
statistics. The firmware sends one pktlog event for every four
PPDUs per peer, which include:

* successful number of packets and bytes transmitted
* number of packets and bytes dropped
* retried number of packets and bytes
* rate info per ppdu

Firmware supports WMI_SERVICE_PEER_STATS, pktlog is enabled through
ATH10K_FLAG_PEER_STATS, which is nowadays enabled by default in ath10k.

This patch does not impact throughput.

Tested on QCA9880 with firmware version 10.2.4.70.48. This should also
work with firmware branch 10.2.4-1.0-00029

Parse peer stats from pktlog packets and update the tx rate information
per STA. This way user space can query about transmit rate with iw:
