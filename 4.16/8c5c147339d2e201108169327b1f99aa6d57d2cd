dm mpath: fix passing integrity data

After v4.12 commit e2460f2a4bc7 ("dm: mark targets that pass integrity
data"), dm-multipath, e.g. on DIF+DIX SCSI disk paths, does not support
block integrity any more. So add it to the whitelist.

This is also a pre-requisite to use block integrity with other dm layer(s)
on top of multipath, such as kpartx partitions (dm-linear) or LVM.

Also, bump target version to reflect this fix.
