kcov: detect double association with a single task

Currently KCOV_ENABLE does not check if the current task is already
associated with another kcov descriptor.  As the result it is possible
to associate a single task with more than one kcov descriptor, which
later leads to a memory leak of the old descriptor.  This relation is
really meant to be one-to-one (task has only one back link).

Extend validation to detect such misuse.
