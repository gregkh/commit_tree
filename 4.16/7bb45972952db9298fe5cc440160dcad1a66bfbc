perf mmap: Introduce perf_mmap__read_event()

Except for 'perf record', the other perf tools read events one by one
from the ring buffer using perf_mmap__read_forward(). But it only
supports non-overwrite mode.

Introduce perf_mmap__read_event() to support both non-overwrite and
overwrite mode.

Usage:
perf_mmap__read_init()
while(event = perf_mmap__read_event()) {
        //process the event
        perf_mmap__consume()
}
perf_mmap__read_done()

It cannot use perf_mmap__read_backward(). Because it always reads the
stale buffer which is already processed. Furthermore, the forward and
backward concepts have been removed. The perf_mmap__read_backward() will
be replaced and discarded later.
