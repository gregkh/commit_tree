rocker: fix possible null pointer dereference in rocker_router_fib_event_work

Currently, rocker user may experience following null pointer
derefence bug:

[    3.062141] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000000000000d0
[    3.065163] IP: rocker_router_fib_event_work+0x36/0x110 [rocker]

The problem is uninitialized rocker->wops pointer that is initialized
only with the first initialized port. So move the port initialization
before registering the fib events.
