dt-bindings: clock: qcom: add remaining clocks for IPQ8074

This patch adds the DT bindings for following IPQ8074 clocks

 - General PLLâ€™s, NSS UBI PLL and NSS Crypto PLL.
 - 2 instances of PCIE, USB, SDCC.
 - 2 NSS UBI core and common NSS clocks. NSS is network switching
   system which accelerates the ethernet traffic. IPQ8074
   NSS has two UBI cores. Some clocks are separate for each UBI core
   and remaining NSS clocks are common.
 - NSS ethernet port clocks. IPQ8074 has 6 ethernet ports and
   each port uses different TX and RX clocks.
 - Crypto engine clocks.
 - General purpose clocks which comes over GPIO.
