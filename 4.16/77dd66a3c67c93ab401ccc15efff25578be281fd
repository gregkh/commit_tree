mm: Fix devm_memremap_pages() collision handling

If devm_memremap_pages() detects a collision while adding entries
to the radix-tree, we call pgmap_radix_release(). Unfortunately,
the function removes *all* entries for the range -- including the
entries that caused the collision in the first place.

Modify pgmap_radix_release() to take an additional argument to
indicate where to stop, so that only newly added entries are removed
from the tree.
