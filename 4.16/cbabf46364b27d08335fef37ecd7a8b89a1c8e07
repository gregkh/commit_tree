net: tracepoint: using sock_set_state tracepoint to trace SCTP state transition

With changes in inet_ files, SCTP state transitions are traced with
inet_sock_set_state tracepoint.
As SCTP state names, i.e. SCTP_SS_CLOSED, SCTP_SS_ESTABLISHED,
have the same value with TCP state names. So the output info still print
the TCP state names, that makes the code easy.
