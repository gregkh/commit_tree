s390x/mm: simplify gmap_protect_rmap()

We never call it with anything but PROT_READ. This is a left over from
an old prototype. For creation of shadow page tables, we always only
have to protect the original table in guest memory from write accesses,
so we can properly invalidate the shadow on writes. Other protections
are not needed.
