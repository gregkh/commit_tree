powerpc/pseries: Fix cpu hotplug crash with memoryless nodes

On powerpc systems with shared configurations of CPUs and memory and
memoryless nodes at boot, an event ordering problem was observed on a
SLES12 build platforms with the hot-add of CPUs to the memoryless
nodes.

* The most common error occurred when the memory SLAB driver attempted
  to reference the memoryless node to which a CPU was being added
  before the kernel had finished initializing all of the data
  structures for the CPU and exited 'device_online' under
  DLPAR/hot-add.

  Normally the memoryless node would be initialized through the call
  path device_online ... arch_update_cpu_topology ... find_cpu_nid ...
  try_online_node. This patch ensures that the powerpc node will be
  initialized as early as possible, even if it was memoryless and
  CPU-less at the point when we are trying to hot-add a new CPU to it.
