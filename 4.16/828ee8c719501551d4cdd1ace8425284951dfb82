media: uvcvideo: Use ktime_t for timestamps

uvc_video_get_ts() returns a 'struct timespec', but all its users
really want a nanoseconds variable anyway.

Changing the deprecated ktime_get_ts/ktime_get_real_ts to ktime_get
and ktime_get_real simplifies the code noticeably, while keeping
the resulting numbers unchanged.
