KVM: arm64: Store vcpu on the stack during __guest_enter()

KVM uses tpidr_el2 as its private vcpu register, which makes sense for
non-vhe world switch as only KVM can access this register. This means
vhe Linux has to use tpidr_el1, which KVM has to save/restore as part
of the host context.

If the SDEI handler code runs behind KVMs back, it mustn't access any
per-cpu variables. To allow this on systems with vhe we need to make
the host use tpidr_el2, saving KVM from save/restoring it.

__guest_enter() stores the host_ctxt on the stack, do the same with
the vcpu.
