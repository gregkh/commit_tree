media: mb86a16: avoid division by zero

As warned by smatch:
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/mb86a16.c:1690 mb86a16_read_ber() error: uninitialized symbol 'timer'.
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/mb86a16.c:1706 mb86a16_read_ber() error: uninitialized symbol 'timer'.

There is a potential risk of doing a division by zero if
timer is not handled well. Enforce it by setting a bit mask
for the values used to select the timer.

It should be noticed that I don't have mb86a16 datasheet. So,
the bitmask was guessed based on the existing checks for
the field. At worse case scenario, it will just show a
badly calculated bit error rate, but it won't crash.

While here, optimize the logic to prevent uneeded tests.
