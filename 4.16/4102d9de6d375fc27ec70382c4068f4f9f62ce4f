dm raid: fix rs_get_progress() synchronization state/ratio

Fix various sync state issues causing racy/bogus sync ratio,
sync_action ad health chars in dm_status() info output.

Sync ratio could be N/N (i.e. 100%) shortly after raid set
creation, i.e. creating a new RaidLV or upconverting a linear LV to
raid1 thus:
  "0 2097152 raid raid1 2 Aa 2097162/2097152 recover 0 0 -"
instead of:
  "0 2097152 raid raid1 2 Aa 0/2097152 idle 0 0 -"

Sync action could be non-idle, when the MD thread was done with io.

Health chars could be 'A' when they should be 'a' for a short time
before a resynchonization started.
