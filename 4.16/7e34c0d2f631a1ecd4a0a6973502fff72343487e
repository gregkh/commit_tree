Revert "mwifiex: cancel pcie/sdio work in remove/shutdown handler"

This reverts commit b713bbf1471b56b572ce26bd02b81a85c2b007f4.

The "fix" in question does not actually fix all related problems, and it
also introduces new deadlock possibilities. Since commit b014e96d1abb
("PCI: Protect pci_error_handlers->reset_notify() usage with
device_lock()"), the race in question is actually resolved (PCIe reset
cannot happen at the same time as remove()). Instead, this "fix" just
introduces a deadlock where mwifiex_pcie_card_reset_work() is waiting on
device_lock, which is held by PCIe device remove(), which is waiting
on...mwifiex_pcie_card_reset_work().

The proper thing to do is just to fix the deadlock. Patch for this will
come separately.
