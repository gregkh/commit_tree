bpf: cpumap: use GFP_KERNEL instead of GFP_ATOMIC in __cpu_map_entry_alloc()

There're several implications after commit 0bf7800f1799 ("ptr_ring:
try vmalloc() when kmalloc() fails") with the using of vmalloc() since
can't allow GFP_ATOMIC but mandate GFP_KERNEL. This will lead a WARN
since cpumap try to call with GFP_ATOMIC. Fortunately, entry
allocation of cpumap can only be done through syscall path which means
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary, so fixing this by replacing GFP_ATOMIC
with GFP_KERNEL.
