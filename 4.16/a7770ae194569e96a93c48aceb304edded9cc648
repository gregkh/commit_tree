firmware: dmi_scan: Fix handling of empty DMI strings

The handling of empty DMI strings looks quite broken to me:
* Strings from 1 to 7 spaces are not considered empty.
* True empty DMI strings (string index set to 0) are not considered
  empty, and result in allocating a 0-char string.
* Strings with invalid index also result in allocating a 0-char
  string.
* Strings starting with 8 spaces are all considered empty, even if
  non-space characters follow (sounds like a weird thing to do, but
  I have actually seen occurrences of this in DMI tables before.)
* Strings which are considered empty are reported as 8 spaces,
  instead of being actually empty.

Some of these issues are the result of an off-by-one error in memcmp,
the rest is incorrect by design.

So let's get it square: missing strings and strings made of only
spaces, regardless of their length, should be treated as empty and
no memory should be allocated for them. All other strings are
non-empty and should be allocated.
