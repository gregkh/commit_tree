ixgbe/fm10k: Record macvlan stats instead of Rx queue for macvlan offloaded rings

We shouldn't be recording the Rx queue on macvlan offloaded frames since
the macvlan is normally brought up as a single queue device, and it will
trigger warnings for RPS if we have recorded queue IDs larger than the
"real_num_rx_queues" value recorded for the device.

Instead we should be recording the macvlan statistics since we are
bypassing the normal macvlan statistics that would have been generated by
the receive path.
