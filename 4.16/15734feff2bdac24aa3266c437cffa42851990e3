drm/radeon: Fix deadlock on runtime suspend

radeon's ->runtime_suspend hook calls drm_kms_helper_poll_disable(),
which waits for the output poll worker to finish if it's running.

The output poll worker meanwhile calls pm_runtime_get_sync() in
radeon's ->detect hooks, which waits for the ongoing suspend to finish,
causing a deadlock.

Fix by not acquiring a runtime PM ref if the ->detect hooks are called
in the output poll worker's context.  This is safe because the poll
worker is only enabled while runtime active and we know that
->runtime_suspend waits for it to finish.

Stack trace for posterity:
