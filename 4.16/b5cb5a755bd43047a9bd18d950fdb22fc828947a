ipv6: Teach tree walker to skip multipath routes

As explained in previous patch, fib6_ifdown() needs to consider the
state of all the sibling routes when a multipath route is traversed.

This is done by evaluating all the siblings when the first sibling in a
multipath route is traversed. If the multipath route does not need to be
flushed (e.g., not all siblings are dead), then we should just skip the
multipath route as our work is done.

Have the tree walker jump to the last sibling when it is determined that
the multipath route needs to be skipped.
