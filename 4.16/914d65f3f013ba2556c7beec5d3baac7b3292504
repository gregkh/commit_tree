watchdog: Fix kref imbalance seen if handle_boot_enabled=0

If handle_boot_enabled is set to 0, the watchdog driver module use
counter will not be increased and kref_get() will not be called when
registering the watchdog. Subsequently, on open, this does not happen
either because the code believes that it was already done because the
hardware watchdog is marked as running.

We could introduce a state variable to indicate this state, but let's
just increase the module use counter and call kref_get() unconditionally
if the hardware watchdog is running when a driver is registering itself
to keep the code simple.
