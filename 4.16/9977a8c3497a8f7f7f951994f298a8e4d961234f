arm64: dts: Remove leading 0x and 0s from bindings notation

Improve the DTS files by removing all the leading "0x" and zeros to fix the
following dtc warnings:

Warning (unit_address_format): Node /XXX unit name should not have leading "0x"

and

Warning (unit_address_format): Node /XXX unit name should not have leading 0s

Converted using the following command:

find . -type f \( -iname *.dts -o -iname *.dtsi \) -exec sed -E -i -e "s/@0x([0-9a-fA-F\.]+)\s?\{/@\L\1 \{/g" -e "s/@0+([0-9a-fA-F\.]+)\s?\{/@\L\1 \{/g" {} +

For simplicity, two sed expressions were used to solve each warnings separately.

To make the regex expression more robust a few other issues were resolved,
namely setting unit-address to lower case, and adding a whitespace before the
the opening curly brace:
