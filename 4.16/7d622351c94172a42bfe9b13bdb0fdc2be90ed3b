drm/i915/fence: Use rcu to defer freeing of irq_work

It is illegal to perform an immediate free of the struct irq_work from
inside the irq_work callback (as irq_work_run_list modifies work->flags
after execution of the work->func()). As we use the irq_work to
coordinate the freeing of the callback from two different softirq paths,
we need to defer the kfree from inside our irq_work callback, for which
we can use kfree_rcu.
