tcp_nv: fix potential integer overflow in tcpnv_acked

Add suffix ULL to constant 80000 in order to avoid a potential integer
overflow and give the compiler complete information about the proper
arithmetic to use. Notice that this constant is used in a context that
expects an expression of type u64.

The current cast to u64 effectively applies to the whole expression
as an argument of type u64 to be passed to div64_u64, but it does
not prevent it from being evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic instead
of 64-bit arithmetic.

Also, once the expression is properly evaluated using 64-bit arithmentic,
there is no need for the parentheses and the external cast to u64.
