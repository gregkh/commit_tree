Revert "tuntap: add missing xdp flush"

This reverts commit 762c330d670e3d4b795cf7a8d761866fdd1eef49. The
reason is we try to batch packets for devmap which causes calling
xdp_do_flush() in the process context. Simply disabling preemption
may not work since process may move among processors which lead
xdp_do_flush() to miss some flushes on some processors.

So simply revert the patch, a follow-up patch will add the xdp flush
correctly.
