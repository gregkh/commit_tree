libbpf: add error reporting in XDP

Parse netlink ext attribute to get the error message returned by
the card. Code is partially take from libnl.

We add netlink.h to the uapi include of tools. And we need to
avoid include of userspace netlink header to have a successful
build of sample so nlattr.h has a define to avoid
the inclusion. Using a direct define could have been an issue
as NLMSGERR_ATTR_MAX can change in the future.

We also define SOL_NETLINK if not defined to avoid to have to
copy socket.h for a fixed value.
