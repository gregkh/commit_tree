media: dvb_ca_en50221: sanity check slot number from userspace

Currently a user can pass in an unsanitized slot number which
will lead to and out of range index into ca->slot_info. Fix this
by checking that the slot number is no more than the allowed
maximum number of slots. Seems that this bug has been in the driver
forever.
