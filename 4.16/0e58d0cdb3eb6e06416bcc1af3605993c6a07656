Bluetooth: hci_ll: Add optional nvmem BD address source

This adds an optional nvmem consumer to get a BD address from an external
source. The BD address is then set in the Bluetooth chip after the
firmware has been loaded.

This has been tested working with a TI CC2560A chip (in a LEGO MINDSTORMS
EV3).
