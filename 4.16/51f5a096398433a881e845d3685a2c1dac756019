drm/i915: Add .get_hw_state() method for planes

Add a .get_hw_state() method for planes, returning true or false
depending on whether the plane is enabled. Use it to rewrite the
plane enabled/disabled asserts in platform agnostic fashion.

We do lose the pre-gen4 plane<->pipe mapping checks, but since we're
supposed sanitize that anyway it doesn't really matter.

v2: Reoder patches to not depend on enum old_plane_id
    Just call assert_plane_disabled() from assert_planes_disabled()
v3: Deal with disabled power wells in .get_hw_state()
v4: Rebase due skl primary plane code removal
