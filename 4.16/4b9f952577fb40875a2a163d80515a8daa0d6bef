KVM: s390: introduce the format-1 GISA

The patch modifies the previously defined GISA data structure to be
able to store two GISA formats, format-0 and format-1. Additionally,
it verifies the availability of the GISA format facility and enables
the use of a format-1 GISA in the SIE control block accordingly.

A format-1 can do everything that format-0 can and we will need it
for real HW passthrough. As there are systems with only format-0
we keep both variants.
