Turn gfs2_block_truncate_page into gfs2_block_zero_range

Turn gfs2_block_truncate_page into a function that zeroes a range within
a block rather than only the end of a block.  This will be used for
cleaning the end of the first partial block and the start of the last
partial block when punching a hole in a file.
