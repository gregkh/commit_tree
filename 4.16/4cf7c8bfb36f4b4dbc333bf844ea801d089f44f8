mm: remove misleading alignment claims

The "third double word block" isn't on 32-bit systems.  The layout looks
like this:

	unsigned long flags;
	struct address_space *mapping
	pgoff_t index;
	atomic_t _mapcount;
	atomic_t _refcount;

which is 32 bytes on 64-bit, but 20 bytes on 32-bit.  Nobody is trying to
use the fact that it's double-word aligned today, so just remove the
misleading claims.
