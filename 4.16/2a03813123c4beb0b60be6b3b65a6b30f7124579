scsi: hisi_sas: add internal abort dev in some places

We should do internal abort dev before TMF_ABORT_TASK_SET and TMF_LU_RESET.
Because we may only have done internal abort for single IO in the earlier part
of SCSI EH process. Even the internal abort to the single IO, we also don't
know whether it is successful.

Besides, we should release slots of the device in hisi_sas_abort_task_set() if
the abort is successful.
