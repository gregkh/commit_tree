KVM: x86: simplify kvm_mwait_in_guest()

If Intel/AMD implements MWAIT, we expect that it works well and only
reject known bugs;  no reason to do it the other way around for minor
vendors.  (Not that they are relevant ATM.)

This allows further simplification of kvm_mwait_in_guest().
And use boot_cpu_has() instead of "cpu_has(&boot_cpu_data," while at it.
