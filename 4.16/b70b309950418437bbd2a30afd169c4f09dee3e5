ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_rt5645: Analog Mic support

Various Cherry Trail boards with a rt5645 codec have an analog mic
connected to IN2P + IN2N. The mic on this boards also needs micbias to
be enabled, on some boards micbias1 is used and on others micbias2, so
we enable both.

This commit adds a new "Int Analog Mic" DAPM widget for this, so that we
do not end up enabling micbias on boards with a digital mic which uses
the already present "Int Mic" widget. Some existing UCM files already
refer to "Int Mic" for their "Internal Analog Microphones" SectionDevice,
but these don't work anyways since they enable the RECMIX BST1 Switch
instead of the BST2 switch.
