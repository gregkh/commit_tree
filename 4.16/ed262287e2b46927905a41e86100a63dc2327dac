IB/srpt: Rename a local variable, a member variable and a constant

Rename rsp_size into max_rsp_size and SRPT_RQ_SIZE into MAX_SRPT_RQ_SIZE.
The new names better reflect the role of this member variable and constant.
Since the prefix "srp_" is superfluous in the context of the function
that creates an RDMA channel, rename srp_sq_size into sq_size.
