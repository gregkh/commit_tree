kasan: unify code between kasan_slab_free() and kasan_poison_kfree()

Both of these functions deal with freeing of slab objects.
However, kasan_poison_kfree() mishandles SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU
(must also not poison such objects) and does not detect double-frees.

Unify code between these functions.

This solves both of the problems and allows to add more common code
(e.g. detection of invalid frees).
