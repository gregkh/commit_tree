PCI: Add generic function to probe PCI host controllers

This patchs moves generic source code from
drivers/pci/host/pci-host-common.c into drivers/pci/probe.c.

Indeed the extracted lines of code were duplicated by many host
controller drivers. Regrouping them into a generic function gives a
change to properly share this code without introducing a useless
dependency to PCI_HOST_COMMON, which selects PCI_ECAM when not needed by
most host controller drivers.
