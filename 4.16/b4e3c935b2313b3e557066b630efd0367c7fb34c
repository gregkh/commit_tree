drm/i915: Save/restore irq state for vlv_residency_raw()

Since commit 6060b6aec03c ("drm/i915/pmu: Add RC6 residency metrics"),
vlv_residency_raw() may be called from an irq-disabled context (via perf
event sampling on remote cpu). As such, we can no longer assume that we
are called from process context and must save/restore the irq state for
the spinlock.

Fixes: 6060b6aec03c ("drm/i915/pmu: Add RC6 residency metrics")
Testcase: igt/perf_pmu/other-init-3
