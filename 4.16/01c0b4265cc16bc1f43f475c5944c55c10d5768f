ALSA: pcm: Fix UAF in snd_pcm_oss_get_formats()

snd_pcm_oss_get_formats() has an obvious use-after-free around
snd_mask_test() calls, as spotted by syzbot.  The passed format_mask
argument is a pointer to the hw_params object that is freed before the
loop.  What a surprise that it has been present since the original
code of decades ago...
