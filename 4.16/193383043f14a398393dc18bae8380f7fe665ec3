arm64: don't open code page table entry creation

Instead of open coding the generation of page table entries, use the
macros/functions that exist for this - pfn_p*d and p*d_populate. Most
code in the kernel already uses these macros, this patch tries to fix
up the few places that don't. This is useful for the next patch in this
series, which needs to change the page table entry logic, and it's
better to have that logic in one place.

The KVM extended ID map is special, since we're creating a level above
CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS and the required function isn't available. Leave
it as is and add a comment to explain it. (The normal kernel ID map code
doesn't need this change because its page tables are created in assembly
(__create_page_tables)).
