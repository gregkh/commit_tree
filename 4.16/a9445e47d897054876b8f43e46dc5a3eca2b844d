posix-cpu-timers: Make set_process_cpu_timer() more robust

Because the return value of cpu_timer_sample_group() is not checked,
compilers and static checkers can legitimately warn about a potential use
of the uninitialized variable 'now'. This is not a runtime issue as all call
sites hand in valid clock ids.

Also cpu_timer_sample_group() is invoked unconditionally even when the
result is not used because *oldval is NULL.

Make the invocation conditional and check the return value.
