media: lirc: allow lirc device to be opened more than once

This makes it possible for lircd to read from a lirc chardev, and not
keep it busy.

Note that this changes the default for timeout reports to on. lircd
already enables timeout reports when it opens a lirc device, leaving
them on until the next reboot.
