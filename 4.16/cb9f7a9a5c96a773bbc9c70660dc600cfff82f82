netlink: ensure to loop over all netns in genlmsg_multicast_allns()

Nowadays, nlmsg_multicast() returns only 0 or -ESRCH but this was not the
case when commit 134e63756d5f was pushed.
However, there was no reason to stop the loop if a netns does not have
listeners.
Returns -ESRCH only if there was no listeners in all netns.

To avoid having the same problem in the future, I didn't take the
assumption that nlmsg_multicast() returns only 0 or -ESRCH.
