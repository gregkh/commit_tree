uio_hv_generic: fix new type mismatch warnings

In commit 72d146578950 ("uio_hv_generic: fix type mismatch warnings"),
I addressed some warnings that show up with CONFIG_X86_PAE, now a new
change has added more of the same:

drivers/uio/uio_hv_generic.c: In function 'hv_uio_probe':
drivers/uio/uio_hv_generic.c:205:5: error: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Werror=pointer-to-int-cast]
drivers/uio/uio_hv_generic.c:225:5: error: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Werror=pointer-to-int-cast]

The fix is the same as before, casting to uintptr_t as an intermediate.
