net: don't unnecessarily load kernel modules in dev_ioctl()

Starting with v4.16-rc1 we've been seeing a higher than usual number
of requests for the kernel to load networking modules, even on events
which shouldn't trigger a module load (e.g. ioctl(TCGETS)).  Stephen
Smalley suggested the problem may lie in commit 44c02a2c3dc5
("dev_ioctl(): move copyin/copyout to callers") which moves changes
the network dev_ioctl() function to always call dev_load(),
regardless of the requested ioctl.

This patch moves the dev_load() calls back into the individual ioctls
while preserving the rest of the original patch.
