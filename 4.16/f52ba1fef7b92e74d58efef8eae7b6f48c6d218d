mm: Allow to kill tasks doing pcpu_alloc() and waiting for pcpu_balance_workfn()

In case of memory deficit and low percpu memory pages,
pcpu_balance_workfn() takes pcpu_alloc_mutex for a long
time (as it makes memory allocations itself and waits
for memory reclaim). If tasks doing pcpu_alloc() are
choosen by OOM killer, they can't exit, because they
are waiting for the mutex.

The patch makes pcpu_alloc() to care about killing signal
and use mutex_lock_killable(), when it's allowed by GFP
flags. This guarantees, a task does not miss SIGKILL
from OOM killer.
