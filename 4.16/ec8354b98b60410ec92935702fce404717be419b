staging: imx: use ktime_t for timestamps

The imx media driver passes around monotonic timestamps in the deprecated
'timespec' format. This is not a problem for the driver, as they won't
overflow, but moving to either timespec64 or ktime_t is preferred.

I'm picking ktime_t for simplicity here. frame_interval_monitor() is
the main function that changes, as it tries to compare a time interval
in microseconds. The algorithm slightly changes here, to avoid 64-bit
division. The code previously assumed that the error was at most 32-bit
worth of microseconds here, so I'm making the same assumption but add
an explicit test for it.
