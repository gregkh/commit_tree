Split buffer's b_fspriv field

By splitting the b_fspriv field into two different fields (b_log_item
and b_li_list). It's possible to get rid of an old ABI workaround, by
using the new b_log_item field to store xfs_buf_log_item separated from
the log items attached to the buffer, which will be linked in the new
b_li_list field.

This way, there is no more need to reorder the log items list to place
the buf_log_item at the beginning of the list, simplifying a bit the
logic to handle buffer IO.

This also opens the possibility to change buffer's log items list into a
proper list_head.

b_log_item field is still defined as a void *, because it is still used
by the log buffers to store xlog_in_core structures, and there is no
need to add an extra field on xfs_buf just for xlog_in_core.
