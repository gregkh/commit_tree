drm/ttm: Don't add swapped BOs to swap-LRU list

A BO that's already swapped would be added back to the swap-LRU list
for example if its validation failed under high memory pressure. This
could later lead to swapping it out again and leaking previous swap
storage.

This commit adds a condition to prevent that from happening.

v2: Check page_flags instead of swap_storage
