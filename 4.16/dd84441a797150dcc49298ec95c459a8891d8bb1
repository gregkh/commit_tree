x86/speculation: Use IBRS if available before calling into firmware

Retpoline means the kernel is safe because it has no indirect branches.
But firmware isn't, so use IBRS for firmware calls if it's available.

Block preemption while IBRS is set, although in practice the call sites
already had to be doing that.

Ignore hpwdt.c for now. It's taking spinlocks and calling into firmware
code, from an NMI handler. I don't want to touch that with a bargepole.
