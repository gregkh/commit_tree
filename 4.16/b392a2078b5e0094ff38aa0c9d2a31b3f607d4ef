net/mlx5e: Verify coalescing parameters in range

Add check of coalescing parameters received through ethtool are within
range of values supported by the HW.
Driver gets the coalescing rx/tx-usecs and rx/tx-frames as set by the
users through ethtool. The ethtool support up to 32 bit value for each.
However, mlx5 modify cq limits the coalescing time parameter to 12 bit
and coalescing frames parameters to 16 bits.
Return out of range error if user tries to set these parameters to
higher values.
