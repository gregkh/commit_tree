ixgbe: Do not manipulate macvlan Tx queues when performing macvlan offload

We should not be stopping/starting the upper devices Tx queues when
handling a macvlan offload. Instead we should be stopping and starting
traffic on our own queues.

In order to prevent us from doing this I am updating the code so that we no
longer change the queue configuration on the upper device, nor do we update
the queue_index on our own device. Instead we can just use the queue index
for our local device and not update the netdev in the case of the transmit
rings.
