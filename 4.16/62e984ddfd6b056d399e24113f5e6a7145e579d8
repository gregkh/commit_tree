powerpc/mm: Flush radix process translations when setting MMU type

Radix guests do normally invalidate process-scoped translations when a
new pid is allocated but migrated guests do not invalidate these so
migrated guests crash sometime, especially easy to reproduce with
migration happening within first 10 seconds after the guest boot start
on the same machine.

This adds the "Invalidate process-scoped translations" flush to fix
radix guests migration.
