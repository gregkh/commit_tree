tools/bpftool: use version from the kernel source tree

Bpftool determines it's own version based on the kernel
version, which is picked from the linux/version.h header.

It's strange to use the version of the installed kernel
headers, and makes much more sense to use the version
of the actual source tree, where bpftool sources are.

Fix this by building kernelversion target and use
the resulting string as bpftool version.

Example:
before:

$ bpftool version
bpftool v4.14.6

after:
$ bpftool version
bpftool v4.15.0-rc3

$bpftool version --json
{"version":"4.15.0-rc3"}
