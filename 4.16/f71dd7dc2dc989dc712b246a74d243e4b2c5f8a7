signal/ptrace: Add force_sig_ptrace_errno_trap and use it where needed

There are so many places that build struct siginfo by hand that at
least one of them is bound to get it wrong.  A handful of cases in the
kernel arguably did just that when using the errno field of siginfo to
pass no errno values to userspace.  The usage is limited to a single
si_code so at least does not mess up anything else.

Encapsulate this questionable pattern in a helper function so
that the userspace ABI is preserved.

Update all of the places that use this pattern to use the new helper
function.
