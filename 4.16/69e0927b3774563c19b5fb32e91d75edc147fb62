blk_rq_map_user_iov: fix error override

During stress tests by syzkaller on the sg driver the block layer
infrequently returns EINVAL. Closer inspection shows the block
layer was trying to return ENOMEM (which is much more
understandable) but for some reason overroad that useful error.

Patch below does not show this (unchanged) line:
   ret =__blk_rq_map_user_iov(rq, map_data, &i, gfp_mask, copy);
That 'ret' was being overridden when that function failed.
