serial: 8250_ingenic: Parse earlycon options

In the devicetree, it is possible to specify the baudrate, parity,
bits, flow of the early console, by passing a configuration string like
this:

aliases {
	serial0 = &uart0;
};

chosen {
	stdout-path = "serial0:57600n8";
};

This, for instance, will configure the early console for a baudrate of
57600 bps, no parity, and 8 bits per baud.

This patches implements parsing of this configuration string in the
8250_ingenic driver, which previously just ignored it.
