drm/msm: avoid false-positive -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

gcc-8 -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc produces a false-positive warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/msm/mdp/mdp5/mdp5_plane.c: In function 'mdp5_plane_mode_set.isra.8':
drivers/gpu/drm/msm/mdp/mdp5/mdp5_plane.c:1053:3: error: 'crtc_x_r' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

It's relatively clear from reading the source that this cannot happen,
and older compilers get it right. This rearranges the code remove
the two affected variables, which reliably avoids the problem.
