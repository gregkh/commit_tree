net: sch: prio: Add offload ability to PRIO qdisc

Add the ability to offload PRIO qdisc by using ndo_setup_tc.
There are three commands for PRIO offloading:
* TC_PRIO_REPLACE: handles set and tune
* TC_PRIO_DESTROY: handles qdisc destroy
* TC_PRIO_STATS: updates the qdiscs counters (given as reference)

Like RED qdisc, the indication of whether PRIO is being offloaded is being
set and updated as part of the dump function. It is so because the driver
could decide to offload or not based on the qdisc parent, which could
change without notifying the qdisc.
