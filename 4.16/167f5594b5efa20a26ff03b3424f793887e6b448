kernel/memremap: Remove stale devres_free() call

devm_memremap_pages() was re-worked in e8d513483300 "memremap: change
devm_memremap_pages interface to use struct dev_pagemap" to take a
caller allocated struct dev_pagemap as a function parameter. A call to
devres_free() was left in the error cleanup path which results in a
kernel panic if the remap fails for some reason. Remove it to fix the
panic and let devm_memremap_pages() fail gracefully.

Fixes: e8d513483300 ("memremap: change devm_memremap_pages interface...")
