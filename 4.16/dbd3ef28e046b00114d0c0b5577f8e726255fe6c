HID: asus: Add touchpad max x/y and resolution info for the T200TA

The Asus T200TA uses the same USB device-id for its keyboard dock as the
T100TA, but the touchpad has a different size and corresponding different
max x/y values.

Add a separate asus_touchpad_info struct for the T200TA and select this
based on the DMI product-name (as we are already doing for the T100HA),
so that we report the correct info to userspace.
