lockdep: Assign lock keys on registration

Lockdep is assigning lock keys when a lock was looked up.  This is
unnecessary; if the lock has never been registered then it is known that it
is not locked.  It also complicates the calling convention.  Switch to
assigning the lock key in register_lock_class().
