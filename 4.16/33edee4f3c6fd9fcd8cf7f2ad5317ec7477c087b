HID: asus: Fix special function keys on T200TA

Just like on the T100TA the T200TA HID descriptors for the 0xff32
Asus vendor usage page need a small fixup. But on the T200TA the HID
descriptors are larger because they have descrriptors for one more
(unused) HID report appended.

Extend the T100TA descriptor fixup to also check for the T200TA's
descriptors size.
