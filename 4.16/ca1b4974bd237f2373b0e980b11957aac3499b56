ahci: Annotate PCI ids for mobile Intel chipsets as such

Intel uses different SATA PCI ids for the Desktop and Mobile SKUs of their
chipsets. For older models the comment describing which chipset the PCI id
is for, aksi indicates when we're dealing with a mobile SKU. Extend the
comments for recent chipsets to also indicate mobile SKUs.

The information this commit adds comes from Intel's chipset datasheets.

This commit is a preparation patch for allowing a different default
sata link powermanagement policy for mobile chipsets.
