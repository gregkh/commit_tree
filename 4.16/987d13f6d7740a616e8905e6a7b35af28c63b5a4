ARM: OMAP2+: dra762: Add support for device package identification

dra762 comes in two packages:
- ABZ: Pin compatible package with DRA742 and DDR@1333MHz
- ACD: High performance(OPP_PLUS) package with new IPs

Both the above packages uses the same IDCODE hence needs to
differentiate using package information in DIE_ID_2.
Add support for the same.
