NTB: Rename NTB messaging API methods

There is a common methods signature form used over all the NTB API
like functions naming scheme, arguments names and order, etc.
Recently added NTB messaging API IO callbacks were named a bit
different so should be renamed to be in compliance with the rest
of the API.
