mmc: sh_mmcif: remove redundant initialization of 'opc'

Variable opc is initialized with a value that is never read, opc
is later re-assigned a newer value, hence the initialization can
be removed.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/mmc/host/sh_mmcif.c:919:6: warning: Value stored to 'opc'
during its initialization is never read
