ath10k: re-enable TXQs for all devices

Commit 4ca1807815aa ("ath10k: disable wake_tx_queue for older devices")
disables the use of the mac80211 TXQs for some devices because of a theoretical
throughput regression. The original regression report[1] was related to
fq_codel qdisc drop performance, which was fixed in commit 9d18562a2278
("fq_codel: add batch ability to fq_codel_drop()"). Since then, we have not
seen the TXQ-related regression, so it should be safe to re-enable TXQs.
