drm/i915: Mark the context state as dirty/written

In the next few patches, we will want to both copy out of the context
image and write a valid image into a new context. To be completely safe,
we should then couple in our domain tracking to ensure that we don't
have any issues with stale data remaining in unwanted cachelines.

Historically, we omitted the .write=true from the call to set-gtt-domain
in i915_switch_context() in order to avoid a stall between every request
as we would want to wait for the previous context write from the gpu.
Since then, we limit the set-gtt-domain to only occur when we first bind
the vma, so once in use we will never stall, and we are sure to flush
the context following a load from swap.

Equally we never applied the lessons learnt from ringbuffer submission
to execlists; so time to apply the flush of the lrc after load as well.
