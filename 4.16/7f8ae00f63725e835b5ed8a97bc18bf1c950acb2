iwlwifi: Cancel and set MARKER_CMD timer during suspend-resume

While entering to D3 mode there is a gap between the time the
driver handles the D3_CONFIG_CMD response to the time the host is going
to sleep.
In between there might be cases which MARKER_CMD can tailgate.
Also during resume flow the MARKER_CMD might get sent while D0I3_CMD
is being handled in the FW.
Cancel MARKER_CMD timer and set it again properly during suspend
resume flows to prevent this command from being sent accidentlly.
