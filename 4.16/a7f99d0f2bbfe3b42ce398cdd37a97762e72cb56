hv_netvsc: use reciprocal divide to speed up percent calculation

Every packet sent checks the available ring space. The calculation
can be sped up by using reciprocal divide which is multiplication.

Since ring_size can only be configured by module parameter, so it doesn't
have to be passed around everywhere. Also it should be unsigned
since it is number of pages.
