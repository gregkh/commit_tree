ALSA: ac97: kconfig: Remove select of undefined symbol AC97

The AC97_BUS_NEW Kconfig symbol selects the globally undefined symbol
AC97.

Robert Jarzmik confirmed in https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/2/7/96 that the
select was put in by mistake and can be safely removed, with no other
changes required. Remove it.
