KVM: arm/arm64: Reduce verbosity of KVM init log

On my GICv3 system, the following is printed to the kernel log at boot:

   kvm [1]: 8-bit VMID
   kvm [1]: IDMAP page: d20e35000
   kvm [1]: HYP VA range: 800000000000:ffffffffffff
   kvm [1]: vgic-v2@2c020000
   kvm [1]: GIC system register CPU interface enabled
   kvm [1]: vgic interrupt IRQ1
   kvm [1]: virtual timer IRQ4
   kvm [1]: Hyp mode initialized successfully

The KVM IDMAP is a mapping of a statically allocated kernel structure,
and so printing its physical address leaks the physical placement of
the kernel when physical KASLR in effect. So change the kvm_info() to
kvm_debug() to remove it from the log output.

While at it, trim the output a bit more: IRQ numbers can be found in
/proc/interrupts, and the HYP VA and vgic-v2 lines are not highly
informational either.
