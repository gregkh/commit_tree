net: stmmac: dwmac-meson8b: fix setting the RGMII TX clock on Meson8b

Meson8b only supports MPLL2 as clock input. The rate of the MPLL2 clock
set by Odroid-C1's u-boot is close to (but not exactly) 500MHz. The
exact rate is 500002394Hz, which is calculated in
drivers/clk/meson/clk-mpll.c using the following formula:
DIV_ROUND_UP_ULL((u64)parent_rate * SDM_DEN, (SDM_DEN * n2) + sdm)
Odroid-C1's u-boot configures MPLL2 with the following values:
- SDM_DEN = 16384
- SDM = 1638
- N2 = 5

The 250MHz clock (m250_div) inside dwmac-meson8b driver is derived from
the MPLL2 clock. Due to MPLL2 running slightly faster than 500MHz the
common clock framework chooses a divider which is too big to generate
the 250MHz clock (a divider of 2 would be needed, but this is rounded up
to a divider of 3). This breaks the RTL8211F RGMII PHY on Odroid-C1
because it requires a (close to) 125MHz RGMII TX clock (on Gbit speeds,
the IP block internally divides that down to 25MHz on 100Mbit/s
connections and 2.5MHz on 10Mbit/s connections - we don't need any
special configuration for that).

Round the divider to the closest value to prevent this issue on Meson8b.
This means we'll now end up with a clock rate for the RGMII TX clock of
125001197Hz (= 125MHz plus 1197Hz), which is close-enough to 125MHz.
This has no effect on the Meson GX SoCs since there fclk_div2 is used as
input clock, which has a rate of 1000MHz (and thus is divisible cleanly
to 250MHz and 125MHz).
