pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7796: Rename RTS{0,1,3,4}# pin function definitions

This patch renames the pin function macro definitions of the GPSR5 and
IPSR{0,3,5,6,12} registers value for the RTS{0,1,3,4}# pin.

This is a correction because GPSR and IPSR register specification for
R8A7796 SoC was changed in R-Car Gen3 Hardware User's Manual Rev.0.54E.
