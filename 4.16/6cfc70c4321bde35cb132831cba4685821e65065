MIPS: Loongson64: Select ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_PARPORT

Commit a211a0820d3c ("MIPS: Push ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_PARPORT down to
platform level") moves the global MIPS ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_PARPORT select
down to various platforms, but doesn't add it to Loongson64 platforms
which need it, so add the selects to these platforms too.
