i2c: update i2c-dev.h warning in documentation

`Documentation/i2c/dev-interface` gives examples for accessing i2c from
userspace.

There's a note that warns developers about the two `i2c-dev.h` header
files which were shipped with the kernel and i2c-tools separately.

However, following i2c-tools commits suggest that the header files are now
identical (in functionality) and `i2c_*` helper functions are now defined
in a separate header called `i2c/smbus.h`, which is distributed with
i2c-tools:

commit 652619121974 ("Minimize differences with kernel flavor")
commit 93caf007f4cb ("Move SMBus helper functions to include/i2c/smbus.h")

Thus, I've converted the warning paragraph into a historical note and
updated the suggested header files.
