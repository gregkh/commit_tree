net/mlx5e: Specify numa node when allocating drop rq

When allocating a drop rq, no numa node is explicitly set which means
allocations are done on node zero. This is not necessarily the nearest
numa node to the HCA, and even worse, might even be a memoryless numa
node.

Choose the numa_node given to us by the pci device in order to properly
allocate the coherent dma memory instead of assuming zero is valid.
