ovl: lookup connected ancestor of dir in inode cache

Decoding a dir file handle requires walking backward up to layer root and
for lower dir also checking the index to see if any of the parents have
been copied up.

Lookup overlay ancestor dentry in inode/dentry cache by decoded real
parents to shortcut looking up all the way back to layer root.
