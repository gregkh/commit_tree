net: tracepoint: replace tcp_set_state tracepoint with inet_sock_set_state tracepoint

As sk_state is a common field for struct sock, so the state
transition tracepoint should not be a TCP specific feature.
Currently it traces all AF_INET state transition, so I rename this
tracepoint to inet_sock_set_state tracepoint with some minor changes and move it
into trace/events/sock.h.
We dont need to create a file named trace/events/inet_sock.h for this one single
tracepoint.

Two helpers are introduced to trace sk_state transition
    - void inet_sk_state_store(struct sock *sk, int newstate);
    - void inet_sk_set_state(struct sock *sk, int state);
As trace header should not be included in other header files,
so they are defined in sock.c.

The protocol such as SCTP maybe compiled as a ko, hence export
inet_sk_set_state().
