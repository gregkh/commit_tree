arm64: limit PA size to supported range

We currently copy the physical address size from
ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1.PARange directly into TCR.(I)PS. This will not work for
4k and 16k granule kernels on systems that support 52-bit physical
addresses, since 52-bit addresses are only permitted with the 64k
granule.

To fix this, fall back to 48 bits when configuring the PA size when the
kernel does not support 52-bit PAs. When it does, fall back to 52, to
avoid similar problems in the future if the PA size is ever increased
above 52.
