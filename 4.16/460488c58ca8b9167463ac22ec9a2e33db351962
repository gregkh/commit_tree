idr: Remove idr_alloc_ext

It has no more users, so remove it.  Move idr_alloc() back into idr.c,
move the guts of idr_alloc_cmn() into idr_alloc_u32(), remove the
wrappers around idr_get_free_cmn() and rename it to idr_get_free().
While there is now no interface to allocate IDs larger than a u32,
the IDR internals remain ready to handle a larger ID should a need arise.

These changes make it possible to provide the guarantee that, if the
nextid pointer points into the object, the object's ID will be initialised
before a concurrent lookup can find the object.
