hv_netvsc: Fix the TX/RX buffer default sizes

The values were not computed correctly. There are no significant
visible impact, though.

The intended size of RX buffer is 16 MB, and the default slot size is 1728.
So, NETVSC_DEFAULT_RX should be 16*1024*1024 / 1728 = 9709.

The intended size of TX buffer is 1 MB, and the slot size is 6144.
So, NETVSC_DEFAULT_TX should be 1024*1024 / 6144 = 170.

The patch puts the formula directly into the macro, and moves them to
hyperv_net.h, together with related macros.
