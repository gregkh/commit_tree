signal/arm64: Document conflicts with SI_USER and SIGFPE,SIGTRAP,SIGBUS

Setting si_code to 0 results in a userspace seeing an si_code of 0.
This is the same si_code as SI_USER.  Posix and common sense requires
that SI_USER not be a signal specific si_code.  As such this use of 0
for the si_code is a pretty horribly broken ABI.

Further use of si_code == 0 guaranteed that copy_siginfo_to_user saw a
value of __SI_KILL and now sees a value of SIL_KILL with the result
that uid and pid fields are copied and which might copying the si_addr
field by accident but certainly not by design.  Making this a very
flakey implementation.

Utilizing FPE_FIXME, BUS_FIXME, TRAP_FIXME siginfo_layout will now return
SIL_FAULT and the appropriate fields will be reliably copied.

But folks this is a new and unique kind of bad.  This is massively
untested code bad.  This is inventing new and unique was to get
siginfo wrong bad.  This is don't even think about Posix or what
siginfo means bad.  This is lots of eyeballs all missing the fact
that the code does the wrong thing bad.  This is getting stuck
and keep making the same mistake bad.

I really hope we can find a non userspace breaking fix for this on a
port as new as arm64.

Possible ABI fixes include:
- Send the signal without siginfo
- Don't generate a signal
- Possibly assign and use an appropriate si_code
- Don't handle cases which can't happen
