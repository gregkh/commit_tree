rds: Incorrect reference counting in TCP socket creation

Commit 0933a578cd55 ("rds: tcp: use sock_create_lite() to create the
accept socket") has a reference counting issue in TCP socket creation
when accepting a new connection.  The code uses sock_create_lite() to
create a kernel socket.  But it does not do __module_get() on the
socket owner.  When the connection is shutdown and sock_release() is
called to free the socket, the owner's reference count is decremented
and becomes incorrect.  Note that this bug only shows up when the socket
owner is configured as a kernel module.
