nvme: fix subsystem multiple controllers support check

There is a problem when another module (e.g. nvmet) takes a reference on
the nvme block device and the physical nvme drive is removed.  In that
case nvme_free_ctrl() will not be called and the controller state will be
"deleting" or "dead" unless nvmet module releases the block device.
Later on, the same nvme drive probes back and nvme_init_subsystem() will
be called and fail due to duplicate subnqn (if the nvme device doesn't
support subsystem with multiple controllers). This will cause a probe
failure.  This commit changes the check of multiple controllers support
at nvme_init_subsystem() by not counting all the controllers at "dead" or
"deleting" state (this is safe because controllers at this state will
never be active again).
