scsi: aacraid: Remove AAC_HIDE_DISK check in queue command

Earlier driver would scan throgh all supported buses and targets and add
devices that responded. It would add devices that were _hidden_ by the fw.
Driver would invalidate commands sent to _hidden_ devices via the
AAC_HIDE_DISK check.

Since the driver now adds only the devices that are supposed to be
exposed, this code can be removed.
