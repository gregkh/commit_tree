dn_getsockoptdecnet: move nf_{get/set}sockopt outside sock lock

After commit 3f34cfae1238 ("netfilter: on sockopt() acquire sock lock
only in the required scope"), the caller of nf_{get/set}sockopt() must
not hold any lock, but, in such changeset, I forgot to cope with DECnet.

This commit addresses the issue moving the nf call outside the lock,
in the dn_{get,set}sockopt() with the same schema currently used by
ipv4 and ipv6. Also moves the unhandled sockopts of the end of the main
switch statements, to improve code readability.
