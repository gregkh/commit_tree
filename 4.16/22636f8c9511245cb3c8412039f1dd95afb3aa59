x86/asm: Add instruction suffixes to bitops

Omitting suffixes from instructions in AT&T mode is bad practice when
operand size cannot be determined by the assembler from register
operands, and is likely going to be warned about by upstream gas in the
future (mine does already). Add the missing suffixes here. Note that for
64-bit this means some operations change from being 32-bit to 64-bit.
