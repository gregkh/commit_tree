soc: mediatek: extend bus protection API

MT2712 add "set/clear" bus control register to each control register set
instead of providing only one "enable" control register, we could avoid
the read-modify-write racing by declaring "bus_prot_reg_update" as "false"
in scp_soc_data or declaring as "true" to use the legacy update method.
By improving the mtk-infracfg bus protection implementation to
support set/clear bus protection control method by IC configuration.
