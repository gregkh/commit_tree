perf rblist: Create rblist__exit() function

Currently we have a rblist__delete() which is used to delete a rblist.
While rblist__delete() will free the pointer of rblist at the end.

It's an inconvenience for the user to delete a rblist which is not
allocated by something like malloc(). For example, the rblist is
embedded in a larger data structure.

This patch creates a new function rblist__exit() which is similar to
rblist__delete() but it will not free the pointer of rblist.
