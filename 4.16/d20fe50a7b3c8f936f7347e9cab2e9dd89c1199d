KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Branch inside feature section

We ended up with code that did a conditional branch inside a feature
section to code outside of the feature section. Depending on how the
object file gets organized, that might mean we exceed the 14bit
relocation limit for conditional branches:

  arch/powerpc/kvm/built-in.o:arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S:416:(__ftr_alt_97+0x8): relocation truncated to fit: R_PPC64_REL14 against `.text'+1ca4

So instead of doing a conditional branch outside of the feature section,
let's just jump at the end of the same, making the branch very short.
