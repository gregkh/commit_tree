Bluetooth: btsdio: Do not bind to non-removable BCM43341

BCM43341 devices soldered onto the PCB (non-removable) always (AFAICT)
use an UART connection for bluetooth. But they also advertise btsdio
support on their 3th sdio function, this causes 2 problems:

1) A non functioning BT HCI getting registered

2) Since the btsdio driver does not have suspend/resume callbacks,
mmc_sdio_pre_suspend will return -ENOSYS, causing mmc_pm_notify()
to react as if the SDIO-card is removed and since the slot is
marked as non-removable it will never get detected as inserted again.
Which results in wifi no longer working after a suspend/resume.

This commit fixes both by making btsdio ignore BCM43341 devices
when connected to a slot which is marked non-removable.
