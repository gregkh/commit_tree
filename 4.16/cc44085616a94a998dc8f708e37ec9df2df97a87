drm/i915/guc: Change default GuC FW for KBL to v9.39

This patch makes v9.39 firmware as default firmware for KBL.

Note: GuC logging control is changed with this firmware. GuC is
expecting i915 to set control bit to enable "default logging"
while using GuC action UK_LOG_ENABLE_LOGGING.
However i915 is currently not doing this because it is version
specific change and can be handled entirely in GuC. It will need
to be fixed in future firmwares.

This update includes (since v9.14):

- DCC spec changes for BXT + DCT enabling
- Bug Fix for power conservation feature SLPC_DCC
- Scheduler 1-element submission during DCC cycles.
- SB based Pre-ETM/ETM flow enabling for debug signed GuC/HuC
- Moving GuC non_critical r/w data to lower SRAM 64KB
- Media engine Reset fix.  Correctly marking context for resubmission in
  Media Reset case.
- ABT Disable bug fix. Disabled Evaluation mode on context change.
- Async FW in Engine Schedule feature (not enabled from KMD)
- GuC clean up to align developer build in line to production build.
- Disable ARAT interrupt before programming ARAT delta.
- Memory range check in Parse to avoid failure due to overflow.
- GuC Msg Channel Hang WA - Stall GUC for mmio access when IDI is low
  during CPD flow.
- Fix for submit queue over flow issue
- Enabling IBC on KBL GT3 15W, GT4 45W
- Disabling wrong device ID WA in production signed kernel
- Enabling WA for MSGCH hang issue upto required KBL stepping
- Clear forcewake in CSB when SQ is empty.
- 3Tries of GuC2CSME wake request
- During reset one parameter was not getting accounted
- Disable DCC 1-elem mode submission
- Move UkGuckmdInterface.h file from 2016 folders to common 2016 folder.
- This is file location change.No functional change done as part of this
  check in.
- Enabling Guc Log changes for ultra low logging for OCA
- Enabling Dynamic Render Power Well Hysteresis Programming for Compute
  Worklaods
- Enabling build failure check to catch critical section overflow.
- Disable build.bat redundant prints.
- Move few least used functions to non-critical section.
- Rearrange GuC documentation folder structure.
- Synchronize SLPC internal debug interface with other branches.
