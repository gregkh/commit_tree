eventfd: fold eventfd_ctx_read() into eventfd_read()

eventfd_ctx_read() is not used outside of eventfd.c, so unexport it and
fold it into eventfd_read().  This slightly simplifies the code and
makes it more analogous to eventfd_write().

(eventfd_ctx_read() was apparently added years ago for KVM irqfd's, but
was never used.)
