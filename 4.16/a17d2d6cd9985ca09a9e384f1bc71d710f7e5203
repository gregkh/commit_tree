media: vsp1: Prevent suspending and resuming DRM pipelines

When used as part of a display pipeline, the VSP is stopped and
restarted explicitly by the DU from its suspend and resume handlers.
There is thus no need to stop or restart pipelines in the VSP suspend
and resume handlers, and doing so would cause the hardware to be
left in a misconfigured state.

Ensure that the VSP suspend and resume handlers do not affect DRM-based
pipelines.
