net: sched: a dflt qdisc may be used with per cpu stats

Enable dflt qdisc support for per cpu stats before this patch a dflt
qdisc was required to use the global statistics qstats and bstats.

This adds a static flags field to qdisc_ops that is propagated
into qdisc->flags in qdisc allocate call. This allows the allocation
block to completely allocate the qdisc object so we don't have
dangling allocations after qdisc init.
