powerpc/sysdev: change CPM GPIO to platform_device

Since commit 9427ecbed46cc ("gpio: Rework of_gpiochip_set_names()
to use device property accessors"), gpio chips have to have a
parent, otherwise devprop_gpiochip_set_names() prematurely exists
with message "GPIO chip parent is NULL" and doesn't proceed
'gpio-line-names' DT property.

This patch wraps the CPM GPIO into a platform driver to allow
assignment of the parent device.
