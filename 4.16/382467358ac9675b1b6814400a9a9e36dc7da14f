signal: Helpers for faults with specialized siginfo layouts

The helpers added are:
send_sig_mceerr
force_sig_mceerr
force_sig_bnderr
force_sig_pkuerr

Filling out siginfo properly can ge tricky.  Especially for these
specialized cases where the temptation is to share code with other
cases which use a different subset of siginfo fields.  Unfortunately
that code sharing frequently results in bugs with the wrong siginfo
fields filled in, and makes it harder to verify that the siginfo
structure was properly initialized.

Provide these helpers instead that get all of the details right, and
guarantee that siginfo is properly initialized.

send_sig_mceerr and force_sig_mceer are a little special as two si
codes BUS_MCEERR_AO and BUS_MCEER_AR both use the same extended
signinfo layout.
