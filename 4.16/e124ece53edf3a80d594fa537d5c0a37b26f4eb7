btrfs: get device pointer from device_list_add()

Instead of pointer to btrfs_fs_devices as an arg in device_list_add()
better to get pointer to btrfs_device as return value, then we have
both, pointer to btrfs_device and btrfs_fs_devices. btrfs_device is
needed to handle reappearing missing device.
