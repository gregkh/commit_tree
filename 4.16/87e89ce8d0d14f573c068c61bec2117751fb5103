mtd: nand: Fix nand_do_read_oob() return value

Starting from commit 041e4575f034 ("mtd: nand: handle ECC errors in
OOB"), nand_do_read_oob() (from the NAND core) did return 0 or a
negative error, and the MTD layer expected it.

However, the trend for the NAND layer is now to return an error or a
positive number of bitflips. Deciding which status to return to the user
belongs to the MTD layer.

Commit e47f68587b82 ("mtd: check for max_bitflips in mtd_read_oob()")
brought this logic to the mtd_read_oob() function while the return value
coming from nand_do_read_oob() (called by the ->_read_oob() hook) was
left unchanged.
