media: cec: add the adap_monitor_pin_enable op

Some devices can monitor the CEC pin using an interrupt, but you
only want to enable the interrupt if you actually switch to pin
monitoring mode.

So add a new op that is called when pin monitoring needs to be
switched on or off.

Also fix a small bug where the initial CEC pin event was sent
again when calling S_MODE twice with the same CEC_MODE_MONITOR_PIN
mode.
