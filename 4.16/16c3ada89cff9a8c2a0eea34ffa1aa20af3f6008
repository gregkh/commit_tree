media: r820t: fix r820t_write_reg for KASAN

With CONFIG_KASAN, we get an overly long stack frame due to inlining
the register access functions:

drivers/media/tuners/r820t.c: In function 'generic_set_freq.isra.7':
drivers/media/tuners/r820t.c:1334:1: error: the frame size of 2880 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

This is caused by a gcc bug that has now been fixed in gcc-8.
To work around the problem, we can pass the register data
through a local variable that older gcc versions can optimize
out as well.
