sfp: use precision to print non-null terminated strings

Rather than memcpy()'ing the strings and null terminate them, printf
allows non-NULL terminated strings provided the precision is not more
than the size of the buffer.  Use this form to print the basic module
information rather than copying and terminating the strings.
