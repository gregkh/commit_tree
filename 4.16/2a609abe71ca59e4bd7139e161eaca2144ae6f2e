sdhci: Advertise 2.0v supply on SDIO host controller

On Intel Edison the Broadcom Wi-Fi card, which is connected to SDIO,
requires 2.0v, while the host, according to Intel Merrifield TRM,
supports 1.8v supply only.

The card announces itself as

  mmc2: new ultra high speed DDR50 SDIO card at address 0001

Introduce a custom OCR mask for SDIO host controller on Intel Merrifield
and add a special case to sdhci_set_power_noreg() to override 2.0v supply
by enforcing 1.8v power choice.
