tcp_bbr: fix pacing_gain to always be unity when using lt_bw

This commit fixes the pacing_gain to remain at BBR_UNIT (1.0) when
using lt_bw and returning from the PROBE_RTT state to PROBE_BW.

Previously, when using lt_bw, upon exiting PROBE_RTT and entering
PROBE_BW the bbr_reset_probe_bw_mode() code could sometimes randomly
end up with a cycle_idx of 0 and hence have bbr_advance_cycle_phase()
set a pacing gain above 1.0. In such cases this would result in a
pacing rate that is 1.25x higher than intended, potentially resulting
in a high loss rate for a little while until we stop using the lt_bw a
bit later.

This commit is a stable candidate for kernels back as far as 4.9.
