ima: pass filename to ima_rdwr_violation_check()

ima_rdwr_violation_check() retrieves the full path of a measured file by
calling ima_d_path(). If process_measurement() calls this function, it
reuses the pointer and passes it to the functions to measure/appraise/audit
an accessed file.

After commit bc15ed663e7e ("ima: fix ima_d_path() possible race with
rename"), ima_d_path() first tries to retrieve the full path by calling
d_absolute_path() and, if there is an error, copies the dentry name to the
buffer passed as argument.

However, ima_rdwr_violation_check() passes to ima_d_path() the pointer of a
local variable. process_measurement() might be reusing the pointer to an
area in the stack which may have been already overwritten after
ima_rdwr_violation_check() returned.

Correct this issue by passing to ima_rdwr_violation_check() the pointer of
a buffer declared in process_measurement().
