ipv6: Use a 31-bit multipath hash

The hash thresholds assigned to IPv6 nexthops are in the range of
[-1, 2^31 - 1], where a negative value is assigned to nexthops that
should not be considered during multipath selection.

Therefore, in a similar fashion to IPv4, we need to use the upper
31-bits of the multipath hash for multipath selection.
