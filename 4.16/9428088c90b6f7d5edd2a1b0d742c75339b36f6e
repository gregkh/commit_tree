drm/qxl: reapply cursor after resetting primary

QXL associates mouse state with its primary plane.

Destroying a primary plane and putting a new one in place has the side
effect of destroying the cursor as well.

This commit changes the driver to reapply the cursor any time a new
primary is created. It achieves this by keeping a reference to the
cursor bo on the qxl_crtc struct.

This fix is very similar to

commit 4532b241a4b7 ("drm/qxl: reapply cursor after SetCrtc calls")

which got implicitly reverted as part of implementing the atomic
modeset feature.
