opp: cpu: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in dev_pm_opp_init_cpufreq_table

After checking all possible call chains to
dev_pm_opp_init_cpufreq_table() here,
my tool finds that this function is never called in atomic context,
namely never in an interrupt handler or holding a spinlock.
And dev_pm_opp_init_cpufreq_table() calls dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count(),
which calls mutex_lock that can sleep.
It indicates that atmtcp_v_send() can call functions which may sleep.
Thus GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary, and it can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
