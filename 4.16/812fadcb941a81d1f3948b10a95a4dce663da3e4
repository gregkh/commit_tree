powerpc/mm: extend _PAGE_PRIVILEGED to all CPUs

commit ac29c64089b74 ("powerpc/mm: Replace _PAGE_USER with
_PAGE_PRIVILEGED") introduced _PAGE_PRIVILEGED for BOOK3S/64

This patch generalises _PAGE_PRIVILEGED for all CPUs, allowing
to have either _PAGE_PRIVILEGED or _PAGE_USER or both.

PPC_8xx has a _PAGE_SHARED flag which is set for and only for
all non user pages. Lets rename it _PAGE_PRIVILEGED to remove
confusion as it has nothing to do with Linux shared pages.

On BookE, there's a _PAGE_BAP_SR which has to be set for kernel
pages: defining _PAGE_PRIVILEGED as _PAGE_BAP_SR will make
this generic
