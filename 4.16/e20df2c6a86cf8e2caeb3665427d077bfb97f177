mm: align struct page more aesthetically

Patch series "Restructure struct page", v2.

This series does not attempt any grand restructuring.  Instead, it cures
the worst of the indentitis, fixes the documentation and reduces the
ifdeffery.  The only layout change is compound_dtor and compound_order
are each reduced to one byte.

This patch (of 8):

Instead of an ifdef block at the end of the struct, which needed its own
comment, define _struct_page_alignment up at the top where it fits
nicely with the existing comment.
