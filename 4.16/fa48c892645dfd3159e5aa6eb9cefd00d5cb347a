perf script: Fix --per-event-dump for auxtrace synth evsels

When processing PERF_RECORD_AUXTRACE_INFO several perf_evsel entries
will be synthesized and inserted into session->evlist, eventually ending
in perf_script.tool.sample(), which ends up calling builtin-script.c's
process_event(), that expects evsel->priv to be a perf_evsel_script
object with a valid FILE pointer in fp.

So we need to intercept the processing of PERF_RECORD_AUXTRACE_INFO and
then setup evsel->priv for these newly created perf_evsel instances, do
it to fix the segfault in process_event() trying to use a NULL for that
FILE pointer.
