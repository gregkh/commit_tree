regmap: debugfs: document why we don't create the debugfs entries

This is a follow-up to commit a5ba91c380b8 ("regmap: debugfs: emit a
debug message when locking is disabled"). I figured that a user may
see this message, grep the code, come to this place and he still won't
know why we actually disabled debugfs.

Add a comment explaining the reason.
