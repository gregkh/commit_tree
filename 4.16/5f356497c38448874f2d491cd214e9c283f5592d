powerpc/8xx: remove unused _PAGE_WRITETHRU

_PAGE_WRITETHRU is only used in:
* AMIGA_Z2RAM block driver which is never activated on powerPC
* Video/FB driver which is for PPC_PMAC

Therefore, no need to spend time in 8xx TLB miss handlers for
handling it.

And by removing it, we free up bit 20 which then avoids having
to clear it on each TLB miss.
