siox: new driver framework for eckelmann SIOX

SIOX is a bus system invented at Eckelmann AG to control their building
management and refrigeration systems. Traditionally the bus was
implemented on custom microcontrollers, today Linux based machines are
in use, too.

The topology on a SIOX bus looks as follows:

      ,------->--DCLK-->---------------+----------------------.
      ^                                v                      v
 ,--------.                ,----------------------.       ,------
 |        |                |   ,--------------.   |       |
 |        |--->--DOUT-->---|->-|shift register|->-|--->---|
 |        |                |   `--------------'   |       |
 | master |                |        device        |       |  device
 |        |                |   ,--------------.   |       |
 |        |---<--DIN---<---|-<-|shift register|-<-|---<---|
 |        |                |   `--------------'   |       |
 `--------'                `----------------------'       `------
      v                                ^                      ^
      `----------DLD-------------------+----------------------'

There are two control lines (DCLK and DLD) driven from the bus master to
all devices in parallel and two daisy chained data lines, one for input
and one for output. DCLK is the clock to shift both chains by a single
bit. On an edge of DLD the devices latch both their input and output
shift registers.

This patch adds a framework for this bus type.
