KVM: Prepare for moving vcpu_load/vcpu_put into arch specific code

In preparation for moving calls to vcpu_load() and vcpu_put() into the
architecture specific implementations of the KVM vcpu ioctls, move the
calls in the main kvm_vcpu_ioctl() dispatcher function to each case
of the ioctl select statement.  This allows us to move the vcpu_load()
and vcpu_put() calls into architecture specific implementations of vcpu
ioctls, one by one.
