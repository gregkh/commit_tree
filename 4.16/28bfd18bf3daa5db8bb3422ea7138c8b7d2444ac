hrtimer: Make the hrtimer_cpu_base::hres_active field unconditional, to simplify the code

The hrtimer_cpu_base::hres_active_member field depends on CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y
currently, and all related functions to this member are conditional as well.

To simplify the code make it unconditional and set it to zero during initialization.

(This will also help with the upcoming softirq based hrtimers code.)

The conditional code sections can be avoided by adding IS_ENABLED(HIGHRES)
conditionals into common functions, which ensures dead code elimination.

There is no functional change.
