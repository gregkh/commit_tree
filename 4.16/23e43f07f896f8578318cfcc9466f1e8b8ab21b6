tuntap: disable preemption during XDP processing

Except for tuntap, all other drivers' XDP was implemented at NAPI
poll() routine in a bh. This guarantees all XDP operation were done at
the same CPU which is required by e.g BFP_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY. But
for tuntap, we do it in process context and we try to protect XDP
processing by RCU reader lock. This is insufficient since
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU can preempt the RCU reader critical section which
breaks the assumption that all XDP were processed in the same CPU.

Fixing this by simply disabling preemption during XDP processing.
