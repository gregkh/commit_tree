tools: bpftool: preserve JSON for batch mode when dumping insns to file

Print a "null" JSON object to standard output when bpftool is used to
print program instructions to a file, so as to avoid breaking JSON
output on batch mode.

This null object was added for most commands in a previous commit, but
this specific case had been omitted.
