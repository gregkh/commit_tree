bpf: offload: factor out netdev checking at allocation time

Add a helper to check if netdev could be found and whether it
has .ndo_bpf callback.  There is no need to check the callback
every time it's invoked, ndos can't reasonably be swapped for
a set without .ndp_bpf while program is loaded.

bpf_dev_offload_check() will also be used by map offload.
