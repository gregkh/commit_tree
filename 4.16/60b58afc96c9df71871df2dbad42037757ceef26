bpf: fix net.core.bpf_jit_enable race

global bpf_jit_enable variable is tested multiple times in JITs,
blinding and verifier core. The malicious root can try to toggle
it while loading the programs. This race condition was accounted
for and there should be no issues, but it's safer to avoid
this race condition.
