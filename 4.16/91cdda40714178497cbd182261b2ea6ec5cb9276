bnxt_en: Forward VF MAC address to the PF.

Forward hwrm_func_vf_cfg command from VF to PF driver, to store
VF MAC address in PF's context.  This will allow "ip link show"
to display all VF MAC addresses.

Maintain 2 locations of MAC address in VF info structure, one for
a PF assigned MAC and one for VF assigned MAC.

Display VF assigned MAC in "ip link show", only if PF assigned MAC is
not valid.
