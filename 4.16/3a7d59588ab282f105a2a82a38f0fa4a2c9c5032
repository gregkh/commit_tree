net: hns3: Increase the default depth of bucket for TM shaper

Burstiness of a flow is determined by the depth of a bucket, When the
upper rate of shaper is large, the current depth of a bucket is not
enough.

The default upper rate of shaper is 100G, so increase the depth of
a bucket according to UM.
