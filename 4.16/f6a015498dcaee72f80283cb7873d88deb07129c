signal/x86: Include the field offsets in the build time checks

Due to an oversight when refactoring siginfo_t si_pkey has been in the
wrong position since 4.16-rc1.  Add an explicit check of the offset of
every user space field in siginfo_t and compat_siginfo_t to make a
mistake like this hard to make in the future.

I have run this code on 4.15 and 4.16-rc1 with the position of si_pkey
fixed and all of the fields show up in the same location.
