x86/apic/vector: Handle vector release on CPU unplug correctly

When a irq vector is replaced, then the previous vector is normally
released when the first interrupt happens on the new vector. If the target
CPU of the previous vector is already offline when the new vector is
installed, then the previous vector is silently discarded, which leads to
accounting issues causing suspend failures and other problems.

Adjust the logic so that the previous vector is freed in the underlying
matrix allocator to ensure that the accounting stays correct.
