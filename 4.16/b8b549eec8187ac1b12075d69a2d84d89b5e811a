xfrm: Fix ESN sequence number handling for IPsec GSO packets.

When IPsec offloading was introduced, we accidentally incremented
the sequence number counter on the xfrm_state by one packet
too much in the ESN case. This leads to a sequence number gap of
one packet after each GSO packet. Fix this by setting the sequence
number to the correct value.
