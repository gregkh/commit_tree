dt-bindings: update compatible string for ILI9225

This updates the compatible string for a no-name LCD panel to
"vot,v220hf01a-t", "ilitek,ili9225".

The original bindings [1] were the generic "ilitek,ili9225-2.2in-176x220"
because I could not find a datasheet. However, after some more research,
I finally found one, so the actual vendor and model name are now known.

This previous bindings have not made it to the mainline kernel yet, so
this is not breaking backwards compatibility.

This is also following the precedence of the ILI9322 bindings [2] by using
the pattern "vendor,specific-system-config", "vendor,ip-part";
