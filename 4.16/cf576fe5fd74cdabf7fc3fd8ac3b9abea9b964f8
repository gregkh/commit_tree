ALSA: korg1212: Delete a duplicate function call "release_firmware" in snd_korg1212_create()

The function "release_firmware" is called in the current implementation of
the function "_request_firmware" after a failure was detected.
Link: https://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.14-rc8/source/drivers/base/firmware_class.c#L1196

Such a call should therefore not be repeated directly after the
corresponding error information was received in the local variable "err"
of the function "snd_korg1212_create".
Thus remove a misplaced function call.
