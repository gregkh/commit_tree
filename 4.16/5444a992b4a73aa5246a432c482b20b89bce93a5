Revert "Input: synaptics - Lenovo Thinkpad T460p devices should use RMI"

This reverts commit 48282969826b3d3c76e908182f69724d86d995fe which
caused the following issues:

1. On T460p with BIOS version 2.22 touchpad and trackpoint stop working
after suspend-resume cycle. Due to strange state of the device another
suspend is impossible.

The following dmesg errors can be observed:
thinkpad_acpi: EC reports that Thermal Table has changed
rmi4_smbus 7-002c: failed to get SMBus version number!
rmi4_physical rmi4-00: rmi_driver_reset_handler: Failed to read current IRQ mask.
rmi4_f01 rmi4-00.fn01: Failed to restore normal operation: -16.
rmi4_f01 rmi4-00.fn01: Resume failed with code -16.
rmi4_physical rmi4-00: Failed to suspend functions: -16
rmi4_smbus 7-002c: Failed to resume device: -16
PM: resume devices took 0.640 seconds
rmi4_f03 rmi4-00.fn03: rmi_f03_pt_write: Failed to write to F03 TX register (-16).
rmi4_physical rmi4-00: rmi_driver_clear_irq_bits: Failed to change enabled interrupts!
rmi4_physical rmi4-00: rmi_driver_set_irq_bits: Failed to change enabled interrupts!
psmouse: probe of serio3 failed with error -1

2. On another T460p with BIOS version 2.15 two finger scrolling gesture
on the touchpad stops working after suspend-resume cycle (about 75%
reproducibility, when it still works, the scrolling gesture becomes
laggy). Nothing suspicious appears in the dmesg.

Analysis form Richard Schütz:

"RMI is unreliable on the ThinkPad T460p because the device is affected
by the firmware behavior addressed in a7ae81952cda ("i2c: i801: Allow
ACPI SystemIO OpRegion to conflict with PCI BAR")."

The affected devices often show:

i801_smbus 0000:00:1f.4: BIOS is accessing SMBus registers
i801_smbus 0000:00:1f.4: Driver SMBus register access inhibited
