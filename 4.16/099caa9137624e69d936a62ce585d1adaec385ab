ACPI: GED: unregister interrupts during shutdown

Some GED interrupts could be pending by the time we are doing a reboot.

Even though GED driver uses devm_request_irq() to register the interrupt
handler, the handler is not being freed on time during a shutdown since
the driver is missing a shutdown callback.

If the ACPI handler is no longer available, this causes an interrupt
storm and delays shutdown.

 1. Don't use devm family of functions for IRQ registration/free
 2. Keep track of the events since free_irq() requires the dev_id
    parameter passed into the request_irq() function.
 3. Call free_irq() on both remove and shutdown explicitly.
