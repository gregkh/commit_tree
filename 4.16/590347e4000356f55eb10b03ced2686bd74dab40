dm bufio: avoid false-positive Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

gcc-6.3 and earlier show a new warning after a seemingly unrelated
change to the arm64 PAGE_KERNEL definition:

In file included from drivers/md/dm-bufio.c:14:0:
drivers/md/dm-bufio.c: In function 'alloc_buffer':
include/linux/sched/mm.h:182:56: warning: 'noio_flag' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  current->flags = (current->flags & ~PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO) | flags;
                                                        ^

The same warning happened earlier on linux-3.18 for MIPS and I did a
workaround for that, but now it's come back.

gcc-7 and newer are apparently smart enough to figure this out, and
other architectures don't show it, so the best I could come up with is
to rework the caller slightly in a way that makes it obvious enough to
all arm64 compilers what is happening here.
