nvme: delete NVME_CTRL_LIVE --> NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING transition

There is no logical reason to move from live state to connecting
state. In case of initial connection establishment, the transition
should be NVME_CTRL_NEW --> NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING --> NVME_CTRL_LIVE.
In case of error recovery or reset, the transition should be
NVME_CTRL_LIVE --> NVME_CTRL_RESETTING --> NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING -->
NVME_CTRL_LIVE.
