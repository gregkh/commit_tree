powerpc/pseries: Update memory hotplug code to use drmem LMB array

Update the pseries memory hotplug code to use the newly added
dynamic reconfiguration LMB array. Doing this is required for the
upcoming support of version 2 of the dynamic reconfiguration
device tree property.

In addition, making this change cleans up the code that parses the
LMB information as we no longer need to worry about device tree
format. This allows us to discard one of the first steps on memory
hotplug where we make a working copy of the device tree property and
convert the entire property to cpu format. Instead we just use the
LMB array directly while holding the memory hotplug lock.

This patch also moves the updating of the device tree property to
powerpc/mm/drmem.c. This allows to the hotplug code to work without
needing to know the device tree format and provides a single
routine for updating the device tree property. This new routine
will handle determination of the proper device tree format and
generate a properly formatted device tree property.
