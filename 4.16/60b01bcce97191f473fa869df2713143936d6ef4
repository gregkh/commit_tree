ath9k_htc: use non-QoS NDP for AP probing

When switching mac80211 to use QoS NDP, it turned out that
ath9k_htc is somehow broken by this, e.g. see
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=891060.

Fix this by using the new mac80211 flag to go back to the
old, incorrect, behaviour for this driver.
