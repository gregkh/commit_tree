usb: uhci: Add clk support to uhci-platform

The Aspeed SoCs use uhci-platform. With the new dynamic clock
control framework, the corresponding IP block clock must be
properly enabled.

This is a simplified variant of what ehci-platform does, it
looks for *one* clock attached to the device, and if it's
there, enables it.
