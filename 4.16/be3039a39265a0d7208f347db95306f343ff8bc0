PCI/DPC: Rename struct dpc_dev.rp to rp_extensions

"rp" is ambiguous: it might mean "this DPC device is a Root Port."  But in
fact, it means "this DPC device is a Root Port *and* it supports a set of
DPC Extensions."

Rename "rp" to "rp_extensions" to make this more clear.  No functional
change intended.
