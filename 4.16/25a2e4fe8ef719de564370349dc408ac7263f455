KVM: nVMX: initialize more non-shadowed fields in prepare_vmcs02_full

These fields are also simple copies of the data in the vmcs12 struct.
For some of them, prepare_vmcs02 was skipping the copy when the field
was unused.  In prepare_vmcs02_full, we copy them always as long as the
field exists on the host, because the corresponding execution control
might be one of the shadowed fields.

Optimization opportunities remain for MSRs that, depending on the
entry/exit controls, have to be copied from either the vmcs01 or
the vmcs12: EFER (whose value is partly stored in the entry controls
too), PAT, DEBUGCTL (and also DR7).  Before moving these three and
the entry/exit controls to prepare_vmcs02_full, KVM would have to set
dirty_vmcs12 on writes to the L1 MSRs.
