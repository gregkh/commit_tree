netfilter: nf_tables: add single table list for all families

Place all existing user defined tables in struct net *, instead of
having one list per family. This saves us from one level of indentation
in netlink dump functions.

Place pointer to struct nft_af_info in struct nft_table temporarily, as
we still need this to put back reference module reference counter on
table removal.

This patch comes in preparation for the removal of struct nft_af_info.
