ipv6: Set nexthop flags during route creation

It is valid to install routes with a nexthop device that does not have a
carrier, so we need to make sure they're marked accordingly.

As explained in the previous patch, host and anycast routes are never
marked with the 'linkdown' flag.

Note that reject routes are unaffected, as these use the loopback device
which always has a carrier.
