lib/bug.c: exclude non-BUG/WARN exceptions from report_bug()

Commit b8347c219649 ("x86/debug: Handle warnings before the notifier
chain, to fix KGDB crash") changed the ordering of fixups, and did not
take into account the case of x86 processing non-WARN() and non-BUG()
exceptions.  This would lead to output of a false BUG line with no other
information.

In the case of a refcount exception, it would be immediately followed by
the refcount WARN(), producing very strange double-"cut here":

  lkdtm: attempting bad refcount_inc() overflow
  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  Kernel BUG at 0000000065f29de5 [verbose debug info unavailable]
  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  refcount_t overflow at lkdtm_REFCOUNT_INC_OVERFLOW+0x6b/0x90 in cat[3065], uid/euid: 0/0
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3065 at kernel/panic.c:657 refcount_error_report+0x9a/0xa4
  ...

In the prior ordering, exceptions were searched first:

   do_trap_no_signal(struct task_struct *tsk, int trapnr, char *str,
   ...
                if (fixup_exception(regs, trapnr))
                        return 0;

  -               if (fixup_bug(regs, trapnr))
  -                       return 0;
  -

As a result, fixup_bugs()'s is_valid_bugaddr() didn't take into account
needing to search the exception list first, since that had already
happened.

So, instead of searching the exception list twice (once in
is_valid_bugaddr() and then again in fixup_exception()), just add a
simple sanity check to report_bug() that will immediately bail out if a
BUG() (or WARN()) entry is not found.
