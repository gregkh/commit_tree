scsi: lpfc: Handle XRI_ABORTED_CQE in soft IRQ

XRI_ABORTED_CQE completions were not being handled in the fast path.
They were being queued and deferred to the lpfc worker thread for
processing. This is an artifact of the driver design prior to moving
queue processing out of the isr and into a workq element. Now that queue
processing is already in a deferred context, remove this artifact and
process them directly.
