spi: imx: do not access registers while clocks disabled

Since clocks are disabled except during message transfer clocks
are also disabled when spi_imx_remove gets called. Accessing
registers leads to a freeeze at least on a i.MX 6ULL. Enable
clocks before disabling accessing the MXC_CSPICTRL register.
