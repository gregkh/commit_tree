bpf: change fake_ip for bpf_trace_printk helper

Currently, for bpf_trace_printk helper, fake ip address 0x1
is used with comments saying that fake ip will not be printed.
This is indeed true for 4.12 and earlier version, but for
4.13 and later version, the ip address will be printed if
it cannot be resolved with kallsym. Running samples/bpf/tracex5
program and you will have the following in the debugfs
trace_pipe output:
  ...
  <...>-1819  [003] ....   443.497877: 0x00000001: mmap
  <...>-1819  [003] ....   443.498289: 0x00000001: syscall=102 (one of get/set uid/pid/gid)
  ...

The kernel commit changed this behavior is:

      tracing: Show address when function names are not found
  ...

This patch changed the comment and also altered the fake ip
address to 0x0 as users may think 0x1 has some special meaning
while it doesn't. The new output:
  ...
  <...>-1799  [002] ....    25.953576: 0: mmap
  <...>-1799  [002] ....    25.953865: 0: read(fd=0, buf=00000000053936b5, size=512)
  ...
