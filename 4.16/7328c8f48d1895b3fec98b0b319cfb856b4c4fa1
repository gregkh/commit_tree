PCI: Add SPDX GPL-2.0 when no license was specified

b24413180f56 ("License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to
files with no license") added SPDX GPL-2.0 to several PCI files that
previously contained no license information.

Add SPDX GPL-2.0 to all other PCI files that did not contain any license
information and hence were under the default GPL version 2 license of the
kernel.
