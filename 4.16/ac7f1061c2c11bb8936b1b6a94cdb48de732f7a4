proc: fix /proc/*/map_files lookup

Current code does:

	if (sscanf(dentry->d_name.name, "%lx-%lx", start, end) != 2)

However sscanf() is broken garbage.

It silently accepts whitespace between format specifiers
(did you know that?).

It silently accepts valid strings which result in integer overflow.

Do not use sscanf() for any even remotely reliable parsing code.

	OK
	# readlink '/proc/1/map_files/55a23af39000-55a23b05b000'
	/lib/systemd/systemd

	broken
	# readlink '/proc/1/map_files/               55a23af39000-55a23b05b000'
	/lib/systemd/systemd

	broken
	# readlink '/proc/1/map_files/55a23af39000-55a23b05b000    '

: In CRIU this bug can be triggered, only if this patch will be backported
: to a kernel which version is lower than v3.16.
