KVM: nVMX: preserve SECONDARY_EXEC_DESC without UMIP

L1 might want to use SECONDARY_EXEC_DESC, so we must not clear the VMCS
bit if UMIP is not being emulated.

We must still set the bit when emulating UMIP as the feature can be
passed to L2 where L0 will do the emulation and because L2 can change
CR4 without a VM exit, we should clear the bit if UMIP is disabled.
