usb: phy: mxs: Fix NULL pointer dereference on i.MX23/28

Commit e93650994a95 ("usb: phy: mxs: add usb charger type detection")
causes the following kernel hang on i.MX28:

[    2.207973] usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage

mxs_phy_charger_detect() makes accesses to the anatop registers via regmap,
however i.MX23/28 do not have such registers, which causes a NULL pointer
dereference.

Fix the issue by doing a NULL check on the 'regmap' pointer.
