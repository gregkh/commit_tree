drm/i915: Consolidate checks for engine stats availability

Sagar noticed the check can be consolidated between the engine stats
implementation and the PMU.

My first choice was a static inline helper but that got into include
ordering mess quickly fast so I went with a macro instead. At some point
we should perhaps looking into taking out the non-ringubffer bits from
intel_ringbuffer.h into a new intel_engine.h or something.

v2: Use engine->flags. (Chris Wilson)
v3: Rebase and mark GuC as not yet supported. (Chris Wilson)
v4: Move flag setting to intel_engines_reset_default_submission.
    (Chris Wilson)
v5: Move flag setting to logical_ring_setup.
v6: intel_engines_reset_default_submission is the wrong place to set the
    flag - it needs to be in execlists_set_default_submission. (Sagar)
v7: Flag setting in logical_ring_setup is not required. (Chris)
