afs: Fix missing cursor clearance

afs_select_fileserver() ends the address cursor it is using in the case in
which we get some sort of network error and run out of addresses to iterate
through, before it jumps to try the next server.  This also needs to be
done when the server aborts with some sort of error that means we should
try the next server.

Fix this by:

 (1) Move the iterate_address afs_end_cursor() call to the next_server
     case.

 (2) End the cursor in the failed case.

 (3) Make afs_end_cursor() clear the ->begun flag and ->addr pointer in the
     address cursor.

 (4) Make afs_end_cursor() able to be called on an already cleared cursor.

Without this, something like the following oops may occur:
