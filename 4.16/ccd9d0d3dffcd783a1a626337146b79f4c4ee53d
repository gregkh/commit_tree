RDMA/bnxt_re: Enable RoCE on virtual functions

RoCE can be used by virtual functions (VFs) as well. Adding
code changes to allow resource reservation, initialization
and avail the resources to the RDMA applications running on
those VFs.

Currently, fifty percent of the total available resources
are reserved for PF and remaining are equally divided among
active VFs.
