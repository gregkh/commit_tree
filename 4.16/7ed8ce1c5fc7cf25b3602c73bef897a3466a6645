xen-blkfront: move negotiate_mq to cover all cases of new VBDs

negotiate_mq should happen in all cases of a new VBD being discovered by
xen-blkfront, whether called through _probe() or a hot-attached new VBD
from dom-0 via xenstore. Otherwise, hot-attached new VBDs are left
configured without multi-queue.
