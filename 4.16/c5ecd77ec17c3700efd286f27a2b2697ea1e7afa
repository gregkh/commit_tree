ARM: dts: vf500: Fix interrupt-controller unit address

The correct unit address for interrupt-controller is 0x40003000, so
change it accordingly in order to fix the following build warning
with W=1:

arch/arm/boot/dts/vf500-colibri-eval-v3.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/aips-bus@40000000/interrupt-controller@40002000 simple-bus unit address format error, expected "40003000"
