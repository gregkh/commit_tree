l2tp: remove l2specific_len dependency in l2tp_core

Remove l2specific_len dependency while building l2tpv3 header or
parsing the received frame since default L2-Specific Sublayer is
always four bytes long and we don't need to rely on a user supplied
value.
Moreover in l2tp netlink code there are no sanity checks to
enforce the relation between l2specific_len and l2specific_type,
so sending a malformed netlink message is possible to set
l2specific_type to L2TP_L2SPECTYPE_DEFAULT (or even
L2TP_L2SPECTYPE_NONE) and set l2specific_len to a value greater than
4 leaking memory on the wire and sending corrupted frames.
