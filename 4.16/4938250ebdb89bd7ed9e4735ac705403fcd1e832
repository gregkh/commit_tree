scsi: lpfc: Linux LPFC driver does not process all RSCNs

During RSCN storms, the driver does not rediscover some targets.  The
driver marks some RSCN as to be handled after the ones it's working
on. The driver missed processing some deferred RSCN.

Move where the driver checks for deferred RSCNs and initiate deferred
RSCN handling if the flag was set. Also revise nport state within the
RSCN confirm routine. Add some state data to a possible debug print to
aid future debugging.
