KVM: s390: consider epoch index on TOD clock syncs

For now, we don't take care of over/underflows. Especially underflows
are critical:

Assume the epoch is currently 0 and we get a sync request for delta=1,
meaning the TOD is moved forward by 1 and we have to fix it up by
subtracting 1 from the epoch. Right now, this will leave the epoch
index untouched, resulting in epoch=-1, epoch_idx=0, which is wrong.

We have to take care of over and underflows, also for the VSIE case. So
let's factor out calculation into a separate function.
