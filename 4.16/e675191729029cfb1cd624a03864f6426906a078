platform/chrome: cros_ec_lpc: Add support for Google Glimmer

This patch adds device information to the DMI table of the cros_ec_lpc
driver for Google Glimmer devices. Since Google BIOS does not enumerate
devices in the LPC bus, the cros_ec_lpc driver checks for system
compatibility and registers the cros_ec device itself.
