KVM: SVM: install RSM intercept

RSM instruction is used by the SMM handler to return from SMM mode.
Currently, rsm causes a #UD - which results in instruction fetch, decode,
and emulate. By installing the RSM intercept we can avoid the instruction
fetch since we know that #VMEXIT was due to rsm.

The patch is required for the SEV guest, because in case of SEV guest
memory is encrypted with guest-specific key and hypervisor will not
able to fetch the instruction bytes from the guest memory.
