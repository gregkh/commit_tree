btrfs: only dirty the inode in btrfs_update_time if something was changed

At this point, we know that "now" and the file times may differ, and we
suspect that the i_version has been flagged to be bumped. Attempt to
bump the i_version, and only mark the inode dirty if that actually
occurred or if one of the times was updated.
