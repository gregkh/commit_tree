stating: ccree: revert "staging: ccree: fix leak of import() after init()"

This reverts commit c5f39d07860c ("staging: ccree: fix leak of import()
after init()") and commit aece09024414 ("staging: ccree: Uninitialized
return in ssi_ahash_import()").

This is the wrong solution and ends up relying on uninitialized memory,
although it was not obvious to me at the time.
