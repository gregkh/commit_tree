iwlwifi: mvm: Fix channel switch for count 0 and 1

It was assumed that apply_time==0 implies immediate scheduling, which is
wrong. Instead, the fw expects the START_IMMEDIATELY flag to be set.
Otherwise, this resulted in 0x3063 assert.
Fix that.
While at it rename the T2_V2_START_IMMEDIATELY to
TE_V2_START_IMMEDIATELY.
