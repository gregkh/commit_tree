genhd: Fix leaked module reference for NVME devices

Commit 8ddcd653257c "block: introduce GENHD_FL_HIDDEN" added handling of
hidden devices to get_gendisk() but forgot to drop module reference
which is also acquired by get_disk(). Drop the reference as necessary.

Arguably the function naming here is misleading as put_disk() is *not*
the counterpart of get_disk() but let's fix that in the follow up
commit since that will be more intrusive.
