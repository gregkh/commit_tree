drm/i915: Empty the ring before disabling

An interesting snippet from Sandybridge's prm:

"Although a Ring Buffer can be enabled in the non-empty state, it must
not be disabled unless it is empty. Attempting to disable a Ring Buffer
in the non-empty state is UNDEFINED."

Let's avoid the undefined behaviour as we disable the rings prior to
reset and resume.

v2: Tell HEAD to catch up to TAIL (empty ring) first, then reset both to
0 (supposedly while stopped).
