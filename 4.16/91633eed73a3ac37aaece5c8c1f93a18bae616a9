tracing/hrtimer: Fix tracing bugs by taking all clock bases and modes into account

So far only CLOCK_MONOTONIC and CLOCK_REALTIME were taken into account as
well as HRTIMER_MODE_ABS/REL in the hrtimer_init tracepoint. The query for
detecting the ABS or REL timer modes is not valid anymore, it got broken
by the introduction of HRTIMER_MODE_PINNED.

HRTIMER_MODE_PINNED is not evaluated in the hrtimer_init() call, but for the
sake of completeness print all given modes.
