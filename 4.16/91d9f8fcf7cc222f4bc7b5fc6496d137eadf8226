MIPS: SMP-CPS: Remove duplicate assignment of core in play_dead

The merge of commit f875a832d2028 ("MIPS: Abstract CPU core & VP(E) ID
access through accessor functions") ended up creating a duplicate
assignment of core during the rebase on commit bac06cf0fb9d ("MIPS:
smp-cps: Fix potentially uninitialised value of core"). Remove the
duplicate.
