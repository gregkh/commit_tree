KVM: arm/arm64: Preserve Exec permission across R/W permission faults

So far, we loose the Exec property whenever we take permission
faults, as we always reconstruct the PTE/PMD from scratch. This
can be counter productive as we can end-up with the following
fault sequence:

	X -> RO -> ROX -> RW -> RWX

Instead, we can lookup the existing PTE/PMD and clear the XN bit in the
new entry if it was already cleared in the old one, leadig to a much
nicer fault sequence:

	X -> ROX -> RWX
