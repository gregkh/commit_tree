drm/i915: Make engine state pretty-printer header configurable

Pass in a format string (and args) to specify the header to be emitted
along with the engine state when pretty-printing. This allows the header
to be emitted inside the drm_printer stream, so sharing the same prefix
and output characteristics (e.g. debug level and filtering).
