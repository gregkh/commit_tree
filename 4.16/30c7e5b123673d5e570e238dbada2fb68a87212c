x86/tsc: Allow TSC calibration without PIT

Zhang Rui reported that a Surface Pro 4 will fail to boot with
lapic=notscdeadline. Part of the problem is that that machine doesn't have
a PIT.

If, for some reason, the TSC init has to fall back to TSC calibration, it
relies on the PIT to be present.

Allow TSC calibration to reliably fall back to HPET.

The below results in an accurate TSC measurement when forced on a IVB:

  tsc: Unable to calibrate against PIT
  tsc: No reference (HPET/PMTIMER) available
  tsc: Unable to calibrate against PIT
  tsc: using HPET reference calibration
  tsc: Detected 2792.451 MHz processor
