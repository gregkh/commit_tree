Input: matrix_keypad - fix race when disabling interrupts

If matrix_keypad_stop() is executing and the keypad interrupt is triggered,
disable_row_irqs() may be called by both matrix_keypad_interrupt() and
matrix_keypad_stop() at the same time, causing interrupts to be disabled
twice and the keypad being "stuck" after resuming.

Take lock when setting keypad->stopped to ensure that ISR will not race
with matrix_keypad_stop() disabling interrupts.
