ipc: fix ipc data structures inconsistency

As described in the title, this patch fixes <ipc>id_ds inconsistency when
<ipc>ctl_stat executes concurrently with some ds-changing function, e.g.
shmat, msgsnd or whatever.

For instance, if shmctl(IPC_STAT) is running concurrently
with shmat, following data structure can be returned:
{... shm_lpid = 0, shm_nattch = 1, ...}
