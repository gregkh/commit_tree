be2net: remove redundant initialization of 'head' and pointer txq

Variable head is initialized to a value that is never read and is
being updated to a new value a few lines later, hence this
initialization is redundant and can be safely removed as well
as the now unused pointer txq.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/net/ethernet/emulex/benet/be_main.c:996:6: warning: Value
stored to 'head' during its initialization is never read
