net_sched: properly check for empty skb array on error path

First, the check of &q->ring.queue against NULL is wrong, it
is always false. We should check the value rather than the address.

Secondly, we need the same check in pfifo_fast_reset() too,
as both ->reset() and ->destroy() are called in qdisc_destroy().
