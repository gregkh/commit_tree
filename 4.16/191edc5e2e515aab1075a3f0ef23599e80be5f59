xhci: Fix front USB ports on ASUS PRIME B350M-A

When a USB device gets plugged on ASUS PRIME B350M-A's front ports, the
xHC stops working:
[  549.114587] xhci_hcd 0000:02:00.0: WARN: xHC CMD_RUN timeout
[  549.114608] suspend_common(): xhci_pci_suspend+0x0/0xc0 returns -110
[  549.114638] xhci_hcd 0000:02:00.0: can't suspend (hcd_pci_runtime_suspend returned -110)

Delay before running xHC command CMD_RUN can workaround the issue.

Use a new quirk to make the delay only targets to the affected xHC.
