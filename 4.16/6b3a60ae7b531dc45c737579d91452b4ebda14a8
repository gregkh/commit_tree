rdma/ib: Add trace point macros to display human-readable values

These can be shared with all kernel ULPs, and more can easily be
added as needed.

Note: checkpatch.pl has some heartburn with the TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM
macros and the LIST macros. These follow the same style as other
header files under include/tracing/events , thus should be
considered acceptable exceptions.
