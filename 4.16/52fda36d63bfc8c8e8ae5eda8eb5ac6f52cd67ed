test_bpf: Fix testing with CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON=y on other arches

Function bpf_fill_maxinsns11 is designed to not be able to be JITed on
x86_64. So, it fails when CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON=y, and
commit 09584b406742 ("bpf: fix selftests/bpf test_kmod.sh failure when
CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON=y") makes sure that failure is detected on that
case.

However, it does not fail on other architectures, which have a different
JIT compiler design. So, test_bpf has started to fail to load on those.

After this fix, test_bpf loads fine on both x86_64 and ppc64el.
