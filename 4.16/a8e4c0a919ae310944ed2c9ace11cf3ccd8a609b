arm64: Move BP hardening to check_and_switch_context

We call arm64_apply_bp_hardening() from post_ttbr_update_workaround,
which has the unexpected consequence of being triggered on every
exception return to userspace when ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN is selected,
even if no context switch actually occured.

This is a bit suboptimal, and it would be more logical to only
invalidate the branch predictor when we actually switch to
a different mm.

In order to solve this, move the call to arm64_apply_bp_hardening()
into check_and_switch_context(), where we're guaranteed to pick
a different mm context.
