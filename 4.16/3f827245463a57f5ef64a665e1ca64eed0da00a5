ANDROID: binder: make binder_alloc_new_buf_locked static and indent its arguments

The function binder_alloc_new_buf_locked() is only used in this file, so
make it static. Also clean up sparse warning:

drivers/android/binder_alloc.c:330:23: warning: no previous prototype
for ‘binder_alloc_new_buf_locked’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In addition, the line of the function name exceeds 80 characters when
add static for this function, hence indent its arguments anew.
