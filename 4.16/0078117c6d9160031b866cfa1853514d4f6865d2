nfsd: return RESOURCE not GARBAGE_ARGS on too many ops

A client that sends more than a hundred ops in a single compound
currently gets an rpc-level GARBAGE_ARGS error.

It would be more helpful to return NFS4ERR_RESOURCE, since that gives
the client a better idea how to recover (for example by splitting up the
compound into smaller compounds).

This is all a bit academic since we've never actually seen a reason for
clients to send such long compounds, but we may as well fix it.

While we're there, just use NFSD4_MAX_OPS_PER_COMPOUND == 16, the
constant we already use in the 4.1 case, instead of hard-coding 100.
Chances anyone actually uses even 16 ops per compound are small enough
that I think there's a neglible risk or any regression.

This fixes pynfs test COMP6.
