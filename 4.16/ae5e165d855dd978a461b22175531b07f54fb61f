fs: new API for handling inode->i_version

Add a documentation blob that explains what the i_version field is, how
it is expected to work, and how it is currently implemented by various
filesystems.

We already have inode_inc_iversion. Add several other functions for
manipulating and accessing the i_version counter. For now, the
implementation is trivial and basically works the way that all of the
open-coded i_version accesses work today.

Future patches will convert existing users of i_version to use the new
API, and then convert the backend implementation to do things more
efficiently.
