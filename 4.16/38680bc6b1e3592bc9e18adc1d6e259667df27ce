dmaengine: qcom_hidma: check pending interrupts

Driver is missing the interrupts if two requests are queued up at the same
time as the interrupt handler is servicing a request that was just
delivered.

The ISR clears the interrupt at the end but it could be clearing the
interrupt for an outstanding event. Therefore, second interrupt never
arrives.

Clear the interrupt first and then check for completions.

Also, make sure that request start and interrupt clear do not overlap in
time by using a spinlock.
