lightnvm: pblk: use exact free block counter in RL

Until now, pblk's rate-limiter has used a heuristic to reserve space for
GC I/O given that the over-provision area was fixed.

In preparation for allowing to define the over-provision area on target
creation, define a dedicated free_block counter in the rate-limiter to
track the number of blocks being used for user data.
