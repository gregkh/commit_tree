ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Show detailed error when DAI configuration callbacks fail

When any of the DAI hardware configuration callbacks (.hw_param,
.set_fmt, .set_sysclk) fails, there is no explanation about why it
failed. This is particularly confusing for .hw_param, which covers
many parameters of the DAI. Telling the users what parameter isn't
supported, and what the requested value was goes a long way for
developers trying to combine sun4i-i2s with external codecs.

This patch adds dev_err calls explaining what isn't supported or
failed, and what the value was. sun4i_i2s_set_clk_rate()'s first
parameter was changed to a struct snd_soc_dai *dai, so we can
get the underlying device.
