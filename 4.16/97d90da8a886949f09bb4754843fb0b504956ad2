mtd: nand: provide several helpers to do common NAND operations

This is part of the process of removing direct calls to ->cmdfunc()
outside of the core in order to introduce a better interface to execute
NAND operations.

Here we provide several helpers and make use of them to remove all
direct calls to ->cmdfunc(). This way, we can easily modify those
helpers to make use of the new ->exec_op() interface when available.
