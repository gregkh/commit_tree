ahci: Add PCI-id for the Highpoint Rocketraid 644L card

Like the Highpoint Rocketraid 642L and cards using a Marvel 88SE9235
controller in general, this RAID card also supports AHCI mode and short
of a custom driver, this is the only way to make it work under Linux.

Note that even though the card is called to 644L, it has a product-id
of 0x0645.
