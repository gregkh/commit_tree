PCI: keystone: Fix interrupt-controller-node lookup

Fix child-node lookup during initialisation which was using the wrong
OF-helper and ended up searching the whole device tree depth-first
starting at the parent rather than just matching on its children.

To make things worse, the parent pci node could end up being prematurely
freed as of_find_node_by_name() drops a reference to its first argument.
Any matching child interrupt-controller node was also leaked.
