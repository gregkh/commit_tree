tcp: avoid min-RTT overestimation from delayed ACKs

This patch avoids having TCP sender or congestion control
overestimate the min RTT by orders of magnitude. This happens when
all the samples in the windowed filter are one-packet transfer
like small request and health-check like chit-chat, which is farily
common for applications using persistent connections. This patch
tries to conservatively labels and skip RTT samples obtained from
this type of workload.
