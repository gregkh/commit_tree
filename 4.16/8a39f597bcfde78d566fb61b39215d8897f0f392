gpio: mockup: rework device probing

We currently create a single platform device in init and then parse
the configuration passed to us via module parameters in probe() before
creating GPIO chips and registering them with the gpiolib framework.

The relation between platform devices and mockup chips should be 1:1.

Create a separate platform device for each mockup chip using convenient
helpers (platform_device_register_resndata()). Pass a platform data
structure to probe() in which the configuration (GPIO base, number of
lines, chip index) extracted from the module params is stored. Make
probe() create a single mockup chip for every platform device.

This approach has several advantages:
- we only parse the module parameters in init() and can bail out before
  attaching any device if the input is invalid (currently we would
  have to examine kernel logs),
- we'll get notified by the device framework about errors in probe()
  for specific chips,
- probe() gets simplified and only does what it's supposed to.
