bnxt_en: close & open NIC, only when the interface is in running state.

bnxt_restore_pf_fw_resources routine frees PF resources by calling
close_nic and allocates the resources back, by doing open_nic. However,
this is not needed, if the PF is already in closed state.

This bug causes the driver to call open the device and call request_irq()
when it is not needed.  Ultimately, pci_disable_msix() will crash
when bnxt_en is unloaded.

This patch fixes the problem by skipping __bnxt_close_nic and
__bnxt_open_nic inside bnxt_restore_pf_fw_resources routine, if the
interface is not running.
