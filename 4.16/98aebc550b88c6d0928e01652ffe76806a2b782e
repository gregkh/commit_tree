IB/ipoib: Update pathrec field if not valid record

In case that the PathRecord is not valid (SM changed its network prefix)
ipoib will continue issue PathQuery requests with the same parameters
that are in its database, which are no longer valid anymore.

Now the driver in that case will re-initialize the record from a valid
place (the priv structure keeps the updated values), and a valid request
will be issued.
