i2c: sh_mobile: make sure to not accidently trigger STOP

The datasheet was a bit vague, but after consultation with HW designers,
we came to the conclusion that we should set the SCP bit always when
dealing only with the ICE bit. A set SCP bit is ignored, and thus fine,
a cleared one may trigger STOP on the bus.
