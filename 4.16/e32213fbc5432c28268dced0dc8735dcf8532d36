eeprom: at24: support eeproms that do not auto-rollover reads

Some multi-address eeproms in the at24 family may not automatically
roll-over reads to the next slave address. On those eeproms, reads
that straddle slave boundaries will not work correctly.

Solution:
Mark such eeproms with a flag that prevents reads straddling
slave boundaries. Add the AT24_FLAG_NO_RDROL flag to the eeprom
entry in the device_id table, or add 'no-read-rollover' to the
eeprom devicetree entry.

Note that I have not personally enountered an at24 chip that
does not support read rollovers. They may or may not exist.
However, my hardware requires this functionality because of
a quirk.
