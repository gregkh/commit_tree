vfio: Simplify capability helper

The vfio_info_add_capability() helper requires the caller to pass a
capability ID, which it then uses to fill in header fields, assuming
hard coded versions.  This makes for an awkward and rigid interface.
The only thing we want this helper to do is allocate sufficient
space in the caps buffer and chain this capability into the list.
Reduce it to that simple task.
