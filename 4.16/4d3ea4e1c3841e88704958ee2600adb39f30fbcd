i2c: exynos5: change internal transmission timeout to 100ms

Exynos-I2C uses default timeout of 1 second for the whole transaction,
including re-transmissions due to arbitration lost errors (-EAGAIN).
To allow re-transmissions driver's internal timeout should be significantly
lower, 100ms seems to be good candidate.
