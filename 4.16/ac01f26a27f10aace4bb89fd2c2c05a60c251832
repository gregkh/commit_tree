btrfs: handle failure of add_pending_csums

add_pending_csums was added as part of the new data=ordered
implementation in e6dcd2dc9c48 ("Btrfs: New data=ordered
implementation"). Even back then it called the btrfs_csum_file_blocks
which can fail but it never bothered handling the failure. In ENOMEM
situation this could lead to the filesystem failing to write the
checksums for a particular extent and not detect this. On read this
could lead to the filesystem erroring out due to crc mismatch. Fix it by
propagating failure from add_pending_csums and handling them.
