IB/uverbs: Fix unbalanced unlock on error path for rdma_explicit_destroy

If remove_commit fails then the lock is left locked while the uobj still
exists. Eventually the kernel will deadlock.

lockdep detects this and says:

 test/4221 is leaving the kernel with locks still held!
 1 lock held by test/4221:
  #0:  (&ucontext->cleanup_rwsem){.+.+}, at: [<000000001e5c7523>] rdma_explicit_destroy+0x37/0x120 [ib_uverbs]
