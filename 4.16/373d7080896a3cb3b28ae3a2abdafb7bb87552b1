drm/amdkfd: Add CWSR support

This hardware feature allows the GPU to preempt shader execution in
the middle of a compute wave, save the state and restore it later
to resume execution.

Memory for saving the state is allocated per queue in user mode and
the address and size passed to the create_queue ioctl. The size
depends on the number of waves that can be in flight simultaneously
on a given ASIC.
