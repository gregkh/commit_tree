KVM: X86: Reduce the overhead when lapic_timer_advance is disabled

When I run ebizzy in a 32 vCPUs guest on a 32 pCPUs Xeon box, I can observe
~8000 kvm_wait_lapic_expire CurAvg/s through kvm_stat tool even if the advance
tscdeadline hrtimer expiration is disabled. Each call to wait_lapic_expire()
will consume ~70 cycles when a timer fires since apic_timer_expire() will
set expired_tscdeadline and then wait_lapic_expire() will do some caculation
before bailing out. So total ~175us per second is lost on this 3.2Ghz machine.
This patch reduces the overhead by skipping the function wait_lapic_expire()
when lapic_timer_advance is disabled.
