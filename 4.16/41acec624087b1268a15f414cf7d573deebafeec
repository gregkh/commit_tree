arm64: kpti: Make use of nG dependent on arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0()

To allow systems which do not require kpti to continue running with
global kernel mappings (which appears to be a requirement for Cavium
ThunderX due to a CPU erratum), make the use of nG in the kernel page
tables dependent on arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0(), which is resolved
at runtime.
