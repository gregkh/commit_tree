rcu: Shrink ->dynticks_{nmi_,}nesting from long long to long

Because the ->dynticks_nesting field now only contains the process-based
nesting level instead of a value encoding both the process nesting level
and the irq "nesting" level, we no longer need a long long, even on
32-bit systems.  This commit therefore changes both the ->dynticks_nesting
and ->dynticks_nmi_nesting fields to long.
