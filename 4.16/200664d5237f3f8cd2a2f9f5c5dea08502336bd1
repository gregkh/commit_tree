crypto: ccp: Add Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) command support

AMD's new Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) feature allows the
memory contents of virtual machines to be transparently encrypted with a
key unique to the VM. The programming and management of the encryption
keys are handled by the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP) which exposes the
commands for these tasks. The complete spec is available at:

http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/55766_SEV-KM%20API_Specification.pdf

Extend the AMD-SP driver to provide the following support:

 - an in-kernel API to communicate with the SEV firmware. The API can be
   used by the hypervisor to create encryption context for a SEV guest.

 - a userspace IOCTL to manage the platform certificates.
