pipe: actually allow root to exceed the pipe buffer limits

pipe-user-pages-hard and pipe-user-pages-soft are only supposed to apply
to unprivileged users, as documented in both Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt
and the pipe(7) man page.

However, the capabilities are actually only checked when increasing a
pipe's size using F_SETPIPE_SZ, not when creating a new pipe.  Therefore,
if pipe-user-pages-hard has been set, the root user can run into it and be
unable to create pipes.  Similarly, if pipe-user-pages-soft has been set,
the root user can run into it and have their pipes limited to 1 page each.

Fix this by allowing the privileged override in both cases.
