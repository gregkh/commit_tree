irqchip/gic-v3: Ignore disabled ITS nodes

On some platforms there's an ITS available but it's not enabled
because reading or writing the registers is denied by the
firmware. In fact, reading or writing them will cause the system
to reset. We could remove the node from DT in such a case, but
it's better to skip nodes that are marked as "disabled" in DT so
that we can describe the hardware that exists and use the status
property to indicate how the firmware has configured things.
