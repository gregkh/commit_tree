hugetlb: fix surplus pages accounting

Dan Rue has noticed that libhugetlbfs test suite fails counter test:

  # mount_point="/mnt/hugetlb/"
  # echo 200 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
  # mkdir -p "${mount_point}"
  # mount -t hugetlbfs hugetlbfs "${mount_point}"
  # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/root/libhugetlbfs/libhugetlbfs-2.20/obj64
  # /root/libhugetlbfs/libhugetlbfs-2.20/tests/obj64/counters
  Starting testcase "/root/libhugetlbfs/libhugetlbfs-2.20/tests/obj64/counters", pid 3319
  Base pool size: 0
  Clean...
  FAIL    Line 326: Bad HugePages_Total: expected 0, actual 1

The bug was bisected to 0c397daea1d4 ("mm, hugetlb: further simplify
hugetlb allocation API").

The reason is that alloc_surplus_huge_page() misaccounts per node
surplus pages.  We should increase surplus_huge_pages_node rather than
nr_huge_pages_node which is already handled by alloc_fresh_huge_page.
