virt: Add vboxguest driver for Virtual Box Guest integration

This commit adds a driver for the Virtual Box Guest PCI device used in
Virtual Box virtual machines. Enabling this driver will add support for
Virtual Box Guest integration features such as copy-and-paste, seamless
mode and OpenGL pass-through.

This driver also offers vboxguest IPC functionality which is needed
for the vboxfs driver which offers folder sharing support.
