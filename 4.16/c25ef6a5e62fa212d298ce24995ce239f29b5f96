samples/bpf: Partially fixes the bpf.o build

Do not build lib/bpf/bpf.o with this Makefile but use the one from the
library directory.  This avoid making a buggy bpf.o file (e.g. missing
symbols).

This patch is useful if some code (e.g. Landlock tests) needs both the
bpf.o (from tools/lib/bpf) and the bpf_load.o (from samples/bpf).
