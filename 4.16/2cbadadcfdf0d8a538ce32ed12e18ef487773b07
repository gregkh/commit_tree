fscrypt: define fscrypt_fname_alloc_buffer() to be for presented names

Previously fscrypt_fname_alloc_buffer() was used to allocate buffers for
both presented (decrypted or encoded) and encrypted filenames.  That was
confusing, because it had to allocate the worst-case size for either,
e.g. including NUL-padding even when it was meaningless.

But now that fscrypt_setup_filename() no longer calls it, it is only
used in the ->get_link() and ->readdir() paths, which specifically want
a buffer for presented filenames.  Therefore, switch the behavior over
to allocating the buffer for presented filenames only.
