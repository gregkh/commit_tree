riscv/barrier: Define __smp_{mb,rmb,wmb}

Introduce __smp_{mb,rmb,wmb}, and rely on the generic definitions
for smp_{mb,rmb,wmb}. A first consequence is that smp_{mb,rmb,wmb}
map to a compiler barrier on !SMP (while their definition remains
unchanged on SMP). As a further consequence, smp_load_acquire and
smp_store_release have "fence rw,rw" instead of "fence iorw,iorw".
