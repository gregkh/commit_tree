Revert "net: thunderx: Add support for xdp redirect"

This reverts commit aa136d0c82fcd6af14535853c30e219e02b2692d.

As I previously[1] pointed out this implementation of XDP_REDIRECT is
wrong.  XDP_REDIRECT is a facility that must work between different
NIC drivers.  Another NIC driver can call ndo_xdp_xmit/nicvf_xdp_xmit,
but your driver patch assumes payload data (at top of page) will
contain a queue index and a DMA addr, this is not true and worse will
likely contain garbage.

Given you have not fixed this in due time (just reached v4.16-rc1),
the only option I see is a revert.
