iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: add support for DMA

Added support for DMA transfers. The implementation uses the user watermark
to decide whether DMA will be used or not. For watermark 1, DMA will not be
used. If watermark is bigger, DMA will be used.
Sysfs attributes are created to indicate whether the DMA is used,
with hwfifo_enabled, and the current DMA watermark is readable
in hwfifo_watermark. Minimum and maximum values are in hwfifo_watermark_min
and hwfifo_watermark_max.
