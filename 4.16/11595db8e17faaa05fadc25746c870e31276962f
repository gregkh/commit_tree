coresight: Fix disabling of CoreSight TPIU

The CoreSight TPIU should be disabled when tracing to other sinks to allow
them to operate at full bandwidth.

This patch fixes tpiu_disable_hw() to correctly disable the TPIU by
configuring the TPIU to stop on flush, initiating a manual flush, waiting
for the flush to complete and then waits for the TPIU to indicate it has
stopped.
