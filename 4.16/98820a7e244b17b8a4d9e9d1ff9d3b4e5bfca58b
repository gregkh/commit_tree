btrfs: add support for SUPER_FLAG_CHANGING_FSID

The UUID change by btrfstune sets SUPER_FLAG_CHANGING_FSID and resets it
only when changing fsid is complete. Its not a good idea to mount the
device anything in between, reading metadata blocks would fail with UUID
mismatch.

This patch doesn't add SUPER_FLAG_CHANGING_FSID into
BTRFS_SUPER_FLAG_SUPP list, so mount will fail (along with the fix in
the next patch) when SUPER_FLAG_CHANGING_FSID is set.
