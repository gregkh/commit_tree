fm10k: Fix configuration for macvlan offload

The fm10k driver didn't work correctly when macvlan offload was enabled.
Specifically what would occur is that we would see no unicast packets being
received. This was traced down to us not correctly configuring the default
VLAN ID for the port and defaulting to 0.

To correct this we either use the default ID provided by the switch or
simply use 1. With that we are able to pass and receive traffic without any
issues.

In addition we were not repopulating the filter table following a reset. To
correct that I have added a bit of code to fm10k_restore_rx_state that will
repopulate the Rx filter configuration for the macvlan interfaces.
