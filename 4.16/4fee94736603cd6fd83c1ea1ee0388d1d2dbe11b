arm64: KVM: Add invalidate_icache_range helper

We currently tightly couple dcache clean with icache invalidation,
but KVM could do without the initial flush to PoU, as we've
already flushed things to PoC.

Let's introduce invalidate_icache_range which is limited to
invalidating the icache from the linear mapping (and thus
has none of the userspace fault handling complexity), and
wire it in KVM instead of flush_icache_range.
