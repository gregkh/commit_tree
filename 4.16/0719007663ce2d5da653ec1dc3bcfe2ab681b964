IB/hfi1: Convert PortXmitWait/PortVLXmitWait counters to flit times

HFI's counters SendWaitCnt and SendWaitVlCnt are in units
of TXE cycle time (at 805MHz). OPA counters PortXmitWait and
PortVLXmtWait are in units of flit times.
Convert the counter values to flit units using following
conversion formula:

PortXmitWait =
	SendWaitCnt * 2 * (4 /link_width) * (25 Gbps /link_speed)
PortVLXmitWait =
	SendWaitVLCnt * 2 * (4 /link_width) * (25 Gbps /link_speed)

At link up or downgrade events, the link width can change. To ensure
accurate counter calculations, sample the counters after the events,
during counter requests, and then aggregate the OPA counters.
