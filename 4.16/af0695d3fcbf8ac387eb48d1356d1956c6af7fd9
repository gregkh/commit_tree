rcutorture/kvm-build.sh: Skip build directory check

Check for build-directory existence and write permissions are provided in
both 'kvm-test-1-run.sh' an 'kvm-build.sh'.  Because the 'kvm-build.sh'
is dependent on 'kvm-test-1-run.sh' ('kvm-build.sh' uses variables that
defined from its caller.), these checks are unnecessarily duplicated.
This commit therefore removes the check in from the 'kvm-build.sh' script.
