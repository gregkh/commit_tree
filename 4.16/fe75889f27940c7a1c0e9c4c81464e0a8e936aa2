RDMA/{cma, ucma}: Simplify and rename rdma_set_ib_paths

Since 2006 there has been no user of rdmacm based application to make use
of setting multiple path records using rdma_set_ib_paths API.

Therefore code is simplified to allow setting one path record entry.
Now that it sets only single path, it is renamed to reflect the same.
