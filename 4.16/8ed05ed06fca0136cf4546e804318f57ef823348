ath10k: handle tdls peer events

Handle tdls peer events from the target. TDLS events for the peer
could be discover, teardown, etc. As of now, adding the logic to
handle tdls teardown events alone.

Teardown due to peer traffic indication(PTR) timeout is one such
teardown event from the target.

Tested this change on QCA9888 with 10.4-3.5.1-00018 fw version.
