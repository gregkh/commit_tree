powerpc/64: rtas avoid accessing paca in 32-bit mode

Commit 177ba7c647f3 ("powerpc/mm/radix: Limit paca allocation in radix")
limited the paca allocation address to 1G on pSeries because RTAS return
accesses the paca in 32-bit mode:

    On return from RTAS we access the paca variables and we have 64 bit
    disabled. This requires us to limit paca in 32 bit range.

    Fix this by setting ppc64_rma_size to first_memblock_size/1G range.

Avoid this limit by switching to 64-bit mode before accessing any memory.
