ocxl: Add a kernel API for other opencapi drivers

Some of the functions done by the generic driver should also be needed
by other opencapi drivers: attaching a context to an adapter,
translation fault handling, AFU interrupt allocation...

So to avoid code duplication, the driver provides a kernel API that
other drivers can use, similar to calling a in-kernel library.

It is still a bit theoretical, for lack of real hardware, and will
likely need adjustements down the road. But we used the cxlflash
driver as a guinea pig.
