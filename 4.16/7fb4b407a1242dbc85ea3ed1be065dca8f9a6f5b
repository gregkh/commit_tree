perf mmap: Don't discard prev in backward mode

'perf record' can switch its output data file. The new output should
only store the data after switching. However, in overwrite backward
mode, the new output still can have data from before switching. That
also brings extra overhead.

At the end of mmap_read(), the position of the processed ring buffer is
saved in md->prev. Next mmap_read should be end in md->prev if it is not
overwriten. That avoids processing duplicate data.  However, md->prev is
discarded. So next the mmap_read() has to process whole valid ring
buffer, which probably includes old processed data.

Avoid calling backward_rb_find_range() when md->prev is still
available.
