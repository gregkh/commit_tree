dm raid: validate current raid sets redundancy

Verifying the current raid sets redundancy based on retrieved
superblock content has to use the superblock's raid level (e.g. raid0),
not the constructor requested one (e.g. raid10).

Using the requested raid level of raid10 lead to a "divide error"
on raid0 which defines data copies divided by to be zero.

Also check for bogus data copies.
