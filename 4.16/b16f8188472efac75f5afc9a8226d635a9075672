RDMA/hns: Refactor eq code for hip06

Considering the compatibility of supporting hip08's eq
process and possible changes of data structure, this patch
refactors the eq code structure of hip06.

We move all the eq process code for hip06 from hns_roce_eq.c
into hns_roce_hw_v1.c, and also for hns_roce_eq.h. With
these changes, it will be convenient to add the eq support
for later hardware version.
