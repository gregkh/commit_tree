ipv6: Move dst->from into struct rt6_info.

The dst->from value is only used by ipv6 routes to track where
a route "came from".

Any time we clone or copy a core ipv6 route in the ipv6 routing
tables, we have the copy/clone's ->from point to the base route.

This is used to handle route expiration properly.

Only ipv6 uses this mechanism, and only ipv6 code references
it.  So it is safe to move it into rt6_info.
