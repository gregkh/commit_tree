hv_netvsc: enable multicast if necessary

My recent change to netvsc drive in how receive flags are handled
broke multicast.  The Hyper-v/Azure virtual interface there is not a
multicast filter list, filtering is only all or none. The driver must
enable all multicast if any multicast address is present.
