torture: Eliminate torture_runnable and perf_runnable

The purpose of torture_runnable is to allow rcutorture and locktorture
to be started and stopped via sysfs when they are built into the kernel
(as in not compiled as loadable modules).  However, the 0444 permissions
for both instances of torture_runnable prevent this use case from ever
being put into practice.  Given that there have been no complaints
about this deficiency, it is reasonable to conclude that no one actually
makes use of this sysfs capability.  The perf_runnable module parameter
for rcuperf is in the same situation.

This commit therefore removes both torture_runnable instances as well
as perf_runnable.
