media: lirc: don't kfree the uninitialized pointer txbuf

The current error exit path if ir_raw_encode_scancode fails is via the
label out_kfree which kfree's an uninitialized pointer txbuf. Fix this
by exiting via a new exit path that does not kfree txbuf.  Also exit
via this new exit path for a failed allocation of txbuf to avoid a
redundant kfree on a NULL pointer (to save a bunch of CPU cycles).

Detected by: CoverityScan, CID#1463070 ("Uninitialized pointer read")

Fixes: f81a8158d4fb ("media: lirc: release lock before sleep")
