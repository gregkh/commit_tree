tcmu: fix unmap thread race

If the unmap thread has already run find_free_blocks
but not yet run prepare_to_wait when a wake_up(&unmap_wait)
call is done, the unmap thread is going to miss the wake
call. Instead of adding checks for if new waiters were added
this just has us use a work queue which will run us again
in this type of case.
