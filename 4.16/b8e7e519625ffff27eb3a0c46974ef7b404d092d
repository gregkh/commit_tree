clk: qcom: ipq8074: add remaining PLLâ€™s

- GPLL2, GPLL4 and GPLL6 are general PLL clocks and parent
  for all core peripherals.
- UBI PLL is mainly used by NSS (Network Switching System).
  IPQ8074 has 2 instances of NSS UBI cores and UBI PLL will
  be used to control the core frequency.
- NSS Crypto PLL is mainly used by NSS Crypto Engine which
  supports the multiple cryptographic algorithm used in
  Ethernet.
- IPQ8074 frequency plan does not require change in PLL post
  dividers so marked the same as read-only.
