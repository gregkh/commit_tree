iio: adis_lib: Initialize trigger before requesting interrupt

The adis_probe_trigger() creates a new IIO trigger and requests an
interrupt associated with the trigger. The interrupt uses the generic
iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function as its interrupt handler.

Currently the driver initializes some fields of the trigger structure after
the interrupt has been requested. But an interrupt can fire as soon as it
has been requested. This opens up a race condition.

iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() will access the trigger data structure
and dereference the ops field. If the ops field is not yet initialized this
will result in a NULL pointer deref.

It is not expected that the device generates an interrupt at this point, so
typically this issue did not surface unless e.g. due to a hardware
misconfiguration (wrong interrupt number, wrong polarity, etc.).

But some newer devices from the ADIS family start to generate periodic
interrupts in their power-on reset configuration and unfortunately the
interrupt can not be masked in the device.  This makes the race condition
much more visible and the following crash has been observed occasionally
when booting a system using the ADIS16460.

To fix this make sure that the trigger is fully initialized before
requesting the interrupt.
