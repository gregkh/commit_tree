misc: ds1682: Ignore update-in-progress ETC reads

The Elapsed Time Counter (ETC) registers are not buffered for reading.
If a 250ms tick occurs while data is being read out, the result can be
a combination of old and new values. This can occur at the byte level
(giving a time in the future) or the individual bit level (giving a
time in the past). We catch both these cases by reading until we get
two equal or consecutive values. After five unsuccessful attempts we
give up.
