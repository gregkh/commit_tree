nilfs2: use time64_t internally

The superblock and segment timestamps are used only internally in nilfs2
and can be read out using sysfs.

Since we are using the old 'get_seconds()' interface and store the data
as timestamps, the behavior differs slightly between 64-bit and 32-bit
kernels, the latter will show incorrect timestamps after 2038 in sysfs,
and presumably fail completely in 2106 as comparisons go wrong.

This changes nilfs2 to use time64_t with ktime_get_real_seconds() to
handle timestamps, making the behavior consistent and correct on both
32-bit and 64-bit machines.

The on-disk format already uses 64-bit timestamps, so nothing changes
there.
