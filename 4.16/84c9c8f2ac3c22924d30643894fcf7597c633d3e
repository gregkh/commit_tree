net/mlx5e: Don't override vport admin link state in switchdev mode

The vport admin original link state will be re-applied after returning
back to legacy mode, it is not right to change the admin link state value
when in switchdev mode.

Use direct vport commands to alter logical vport state in netdev
representor open/close flows rather than the administrative eswitch API.
