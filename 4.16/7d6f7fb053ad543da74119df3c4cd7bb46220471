regmap: add SLIMbus support

This patch adds support to read/write SLIMbus value elements.
Currently it only supports byte read/write. Adding this support in
regmap would give codec drivers more flexibility when there are more
than 2 control interfaces like SLIMbus, i2c.

Without this patch each codec driver has to directly call SLIMbus value
element apis, and this could would get messy once we want to add i2c
interface to it.
