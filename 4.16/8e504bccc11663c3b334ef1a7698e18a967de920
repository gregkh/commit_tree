drm/amd/display: Disable plane right after disconnected

HDR display playing video underflow is observed when switching
to full screen due to program a lower watermark right after unlock otg.

Instead of disable plane in next flip coming, if there is a
plane disconnected, after otg unlock wait for mpcc idle and disable
the plane, then program watermark. So there is enough warter mark to make
sure current frame data pass through.
