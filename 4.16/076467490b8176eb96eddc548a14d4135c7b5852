kvm: fix warning for CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_EVENTFD builds

Move the kvm_arch_irq_routing_update() prototype outside of
ifdef CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_EVENTFD guards to fix the following sparse warning:

arch/s390/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/irqchip.c:171:28: warning: symbol 'kvm_arch_irq_routing_update' was not declared. Should it be static?
