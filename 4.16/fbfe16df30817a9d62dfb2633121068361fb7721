drm/tegra: hdmi: Move register definitions into a table

After commit 07a8aab89927 ("drm/tegra: hdmi: Trace register accesses"),
the debugfs register dump implementation causes excessive stack usage
and can result in build warnings. To fix this, move the register
definitions into a table and iterate over the table while dumping the
registers to debugfs.
