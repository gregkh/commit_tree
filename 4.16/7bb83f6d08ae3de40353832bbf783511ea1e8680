ARM: dts: vf610-zii-dev-rev-b: add PHYs for switch2

Switch 2 has an 88e1545 PHY behind it, which is a quad PHY.  Only the
first three PHYs are used, the remaining PHY is unused.  When we wire
up the SFF sockets in a later commit, the omission of this causes the
fourth PHY to be used for port 3.  Specifying the PHYs in DT avoids
the auto-probing of the bus, and discovery of this PHY.
