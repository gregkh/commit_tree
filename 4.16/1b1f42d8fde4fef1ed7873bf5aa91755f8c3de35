drm: move amd_gpu_scheduler into common location

This moves and renames the AMDGPU scheduler to a common location in DRM
in order to facilitate re-use by other drivers. This is mostly a straight
forward rename with no code changes.

One notable exception is the function to_drm_sched_fence(), which is no
longer a inline header function to avoid the need to export the
drm_sched_fence_ops_scheduled and drm_sched_fence_ops_finished structures.
