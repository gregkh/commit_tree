ARM: 8748/1: mm: Define vdso_start, vdso_end as array

Define vdso_start, vdso_end as array to avoid compile-time analysis error
for the case of built with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.

and, since vdso_start, vdso_end are used in vdso.c only,
move extern-declaration from vdso.h to vdso.c.

If kernel is built with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE,
compile-time error happens at this code.
- if (memcmp(&vdso_start, "177ELF", 4))

The size of "&vdso_start" is recognized as 1 byte, but n is 4,
So that compile-time error is reported.
