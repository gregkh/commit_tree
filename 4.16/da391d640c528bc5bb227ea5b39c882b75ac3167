mm: correct comments regarding do_fault_around()

There are multiple comments surrounding do_fault_around that memtion
fault_around_pages() and fault_around_mask(), two routines that do not
exist.  These comments should be reworded to reference
fault_around_bytes, the value which is used to determine how much
do_fault_around() will attempt to read when processing a fault.

These comments should have been updated when fault_around_pages() and
fault_around_mask() were removed in commit aecd6f44266c ("mm: close race
between do_fault_around() and fault_around_bytes_set()").

Fixes: aecd6f44266c1 ("mm: close race between do_fault_around() and fault_around_bytes_set()")
