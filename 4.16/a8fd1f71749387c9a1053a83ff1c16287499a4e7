btrfs: use kvzalloc to allocate btrfs_fs_info

The srcu_struct in btrfs_fs_info scales in size with NR_CPUS.  On
kernels built with NR_CPUS=8192, this can result in kmalloc failures
that prevent mounting.

There is work in progress to try to resolve this for every user of
srcu_struct but using kvzalloc will work around the failures until
that is complete.

As an example with NR_CPUS=512 on x86_64: the overall size of
subvol_srcu is 3460 bytes, fs_info is 6496.
