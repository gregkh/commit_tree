btrfs: Make btrfs_async_run_delayed_root use a loop rather than multiple labels

Currently btrfs_async_run_delayed_root's implementation uses 3 goto
labels to mimic the functionality of a simple do {} while loop. Refactor
the function to use a do {} while construct, making intention clear and
code easier to follow. No functional changes.
