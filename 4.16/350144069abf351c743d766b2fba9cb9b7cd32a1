ALSA: x86: Fix missing spinlock and mutex initializations

The commit change for supporting the multiple ports moved involved
some code shuffling, and there the initializations of spinlock and
mutex in snd_intelhad object were dropped mistakenly.

This patch adds the missing initializations again for each port.
