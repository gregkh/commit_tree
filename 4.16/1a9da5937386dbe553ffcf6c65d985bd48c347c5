netfilter: ipt_CLUSTERIP: put config instead of freeing it

Once struct is added to per-netns list it becomes visible to other cpus,
so we cannot use kfree().

Also delay setting entries refcount to 1 until after everything is
initialised so that when we call clusterip_config_put() in this spot
entries is still zero.
