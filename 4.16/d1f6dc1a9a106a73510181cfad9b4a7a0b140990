drm/amdgpu: Avoid accessing job->entity after the job is scheduled.

Bug: amdgpu_job_free_cb was accessing s_job->s_entity when the allocated
amdgpu_ctx (and the entity inside it) were already deallocated from
amdgpu_cs_parser_fini.

Fix: Save job's priority on it's creation instead of accessing it from
s_entity later on.
