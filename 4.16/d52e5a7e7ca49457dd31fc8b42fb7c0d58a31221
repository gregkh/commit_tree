ipv4: lock mtu in fnhe when received PMTU < net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu

Prior to the rework of PMTU information storage in commit
2c8cec5c10bc ("ipv4: Cache learned PMTU information in inetpeer."),
when a PMTU event advertising a PMTU smaller than
net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu was received, we would disable setting the DF
flag on packets by locking the MTU metric, and set the PMTU to
net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu.

Since then, we don't disable DF, and set PMTU to
net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu, so the intermediate router that has this link
with a small MTU will have to drop the packets.

This patch reestablishes pre-2.6.39 behavior by splitting
rtable->rt_pmtu into a bitfield with rt_mtu_locked and rt_pmtu.
rt_mtu_locked indicates that we shouldn't set the DF bit on that path,
and is checked in ip_dont_fragment().

One possible workaround is to set net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu to a value low
enough to accommodate the lowest MTU encountered.
