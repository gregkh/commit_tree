hugetlb, mbind: fall back to default policy if vma is NULL

Dan Carpenter has noticed that mbind migration callback (new_page) can
get a NULL vma pointer and choke on it inside alloc_huge_page_vma which
relies on the VMA to get the hstate.  We used to BUG_ON this case but
the BUG_+ON has been removed recently by "hugetlb, mempolicy: fix the
mbind hugetlb migration".

The proper way to handle this is to get the hstate from the migrated
page and rely on huge_node (resp.  get_vma_policy) do the right thing
with null VMA.  We are currently falling back to the default mempolicy
in that case which is in line what THP path is doing here.
