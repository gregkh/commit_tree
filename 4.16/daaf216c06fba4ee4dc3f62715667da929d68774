KVM: x86: Fix device passthrough when SME is active

When using device passthrough with SME active, the MMIO range that is
mapped for the device should not be mapped encrypted.  Add a check in
set_spte() to insure that a page is not mapped encrypted if that page
is a device MMIO page as indicated by kvm_is_mmio_pfn().
