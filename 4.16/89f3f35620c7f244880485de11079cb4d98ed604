drm/fb-helper: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

fb_helper is being dereferenced before it is null checked,
hence there is a potential null pointer dereference.

Fix this by moving the pointer dereference after fb_helper
has been null checked.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
