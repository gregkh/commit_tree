ocfs2: return -EROFS to mount.ocfs2 if inode block is invalid

If metadata is corrupted such as 'invalid inode block', we will get
failed by calling 'mount()' and then set filesystem readonly as below:

  ocfs2_mount
    ocfs2_initialize_super
      ocfs2_init_global_system_inodes
        ocfs2_iget
          ocfs2_read_locked_inode
            ocfs2_validate_inode_block
	      ocfs2_error
	        ocfs2_handle_error
	          ocfs2_set_ro_flag(osb, 0);  // set readonly

In this situation we need return -EROFS to 'mount.ocfs2', so that user
can fix it by fsck.  And then mount again.  In addition, 'mount.ocfs2'
should be updated correspondingly as it only return 1 for all errno.
And I will post a patch for 'mount.ocfs2' too.
