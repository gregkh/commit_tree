net: sched: helpers to sum qlen and qlen for per cpu logic

Add qdisc qlen helper routines for lockless qdiscs to use.

The qdisc qlen is no longer used in the hotpath but it is reported
via stats query on the qdisc so it still needs to be tracked. This
adds the per cpu operations needed along with a helper to return
the summation of per cpu stats.
