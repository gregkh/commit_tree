scsi: sd: Keep disk read-only when re-reading partition

If the read-only flag is true on a SCSI disk, re-reading the partition
table sets the flag back to false.

To observe this bug, you can run:

1. blockdev --setro /dev/sda
2. blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sda
3. blockdev --getro /dev/sda

This commit reads the disk's old state and combines it with the device
disk-reported state rather than unconditionally marking it as RW.
