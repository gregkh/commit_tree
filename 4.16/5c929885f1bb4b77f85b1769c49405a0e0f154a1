powerpc/vdso64: Add support for CLOCK_{REALTIME/MONOTONIC}_COARSE

Current vDSO64 implementation does not have support for coarse clocks
(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE, CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE), for which it falls back
to system call, increasing the response time, vDSO implementation reduces
the cycle time. Below is a benchmark of the difference in execution times.

(Non-coarse clocks are also included just for completion)

clock-gettime-realtime: syscall: 172 nsec/call
clock-gettime-realtime:    libc: 28 nsec/call
clock-gettime-realtime:    vdso: 22 nsec/call
clock-gettime-monotonic: syscall: 171 nsec/call
clock-gettime-monotonic:    libc: 30 nsec/call
clock-gettime-monotonic:    vdso: 25 nsec/call
clock-gettime-realtime-coarse: syscall: 153 nsec/call
clock-gettime-realtime-coarse:    libc: 16 nsec/call
clock-gettime-realtime-coarse:    vdso: 10 nsec/call
clock-gettime-monotonic-coarse: syscall: 167 nsec/call
clock-gettime-monotonic-coarse:    libc: 17 nsec/call
clock-gettime-monotonic-coarse:    vdso: 11 nsec/call
