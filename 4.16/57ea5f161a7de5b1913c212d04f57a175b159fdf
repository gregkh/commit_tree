KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Fix broken select due to misspelling

Commit 76d837a4c0f9 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Don't include SPAPR TCE code
on non-pseries platforms") added a reference to the globally undefined
symbol PPC_SERIES. Looking at the rest of the commit, PPC_PSERIES was
probably intended.

Change PPC_SERIES to PPC_PSERIES.

Discovered with the

script.
