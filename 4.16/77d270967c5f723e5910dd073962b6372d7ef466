mlxsw: spectrum: Fix handling of resource_size_param

Current code uses global variables, adjusts them and passes pointer down
to devlink. With every other mlxsw_core instance, the previously passed
pointer values are rewritten. Fix this by de-globalize the variables and
also memcpy size_params during devlink resource registration.
Also, introduce a convenient size_param_init helper.
