usb: gadget: bcm63xx_udc: Use common error handling code in bcm63xx_udc_probe()

Add a jump target so that a specific error message is stored only once
at the end of this function implementation.
Replace two calls of the function "dev_err" by goto statements.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
