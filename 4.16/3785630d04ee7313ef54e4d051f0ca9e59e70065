arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916-pins: move sdhc2 cd node with its siblings

Nodes relative to the first sdhc node were interlaced with node of the
second sdhc. Move sdhc2_cd_pin with its siblings to prevent that. Also
rename the grouping node from sdhc2_cd_pin to pmx_sdc2_cd_pin, as
"pmx_sdc" is the prefix used by other nodes.
