PCI: tegra: Remove PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_BUS use on Tegra

Bridge primary, secondary, and subordinate bus numbers power up as zero,
and Tegra firmware doesn't program them.

pci_scan_bridge_extend() automatically programs these bus numbers if they
are zero, so we don't need to set the PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_BUS flag for Tegra.
