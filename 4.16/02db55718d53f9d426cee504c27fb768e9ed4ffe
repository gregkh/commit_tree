tcp: do not overshoot window_clamp in tcp_rcv_space_adjust()

While rcvbuf is properly clamped by tcp_rmem[2], rcvwin
is left to a potentially too big value.

It has no serious effect, since :
1) tcp_grow_window() has very strict checks.
2) window_clamp can be mangled by user space to any value anyway.

tcp_init_buffer_space() and companions use tcp_full_space(),
we use tcp_win_from_space() to avoid reloading sk->sk_rcvbuf
