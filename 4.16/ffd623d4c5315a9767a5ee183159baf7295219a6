platform/x86: intel_telemetry: Improve S0ix logs

Suspend with shallow wakes is not a useful parameter since the phenomena
does not exist on deployed devices and is only a parameter of use during
device power-on phase. The field always reads zero. Additionally there
are other easier methods to detect it, e.g., if the S0ix counter
increments by more than one during suspend. Hence the field is superfluous
and can be removed.

This patch also slightly renames the S0ix total field for better
viewability.
