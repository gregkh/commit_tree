torture: Suppress CPU stall warnings during shutdown ftrace dump

The torture_shutdown() function directly invokes ftrace_dump(), which
can result in RCU CPU stall warnings when the ftrace buffer is large,
which it usually is.  This commit therefore invoks rcu_ftrace_dump()
in place of ftrace_dump(), suppressing RCU CPU stall warnings during
this time.
