scsi: qla2xxx: ensure async flags are reset correctly

The fcport flags FCF_ASYNC_ACTIVE and FCF_ASYNC_SENT are used to
throttle the state machine, so we need to ensure to always set and unset
them correctly. Not doing so will lead to the state machine getting
confused and no login attempt into remote ports.
