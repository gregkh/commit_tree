MIPS: XPA: Use XPA instructions in assembly

Utilise XPA instructions MFHC0 & MTHC0 in inline assembly instead of
directly encoding them with the _ASM_INSN* macros, and transparently
implement these instructions as assembler macros if the toolchain
doesn't support them natively, using the recently introduced assembler
macro helpers.

The old direct encodings were restricted to using the register $at, so
this allows the extra register moves to go away (saving a grand total of
24 bytes).
