scsi: qla2xxx: Remove FC_NO_LOOP_ID for FCP and FC-NVMe Discovery

Commit 7d64c39e64310 fixed regression of FCP discovery when Nport Handle
is in-use and relogin is triggered. However, during FCP and FC-NVMe
discovery this resulted into only discovering NVMe LUNs.

This patch fixes issue where FCP and FC-NVMe protocol is used on same
port where assigning FC_NO_LOOP_ID will result into discovery failure
for FCP LUNs.
