bpf: offload: allow netdev to disappear while verifier is running

To allow verifier instruction callbacks without any extra locking
NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification would wait on a waitqueue for verifier
to finish.  This design decision was made when rtnl lock was providing
all the locking.  Use the read/write lock instead and remove the
workqueue.

Verifier will now call into the offload code, so dev_ops are moved
to offload structure.  Since verifier calls are all under
bpf_prog_is_dev_bound() we no longer need static inline implementations
to please builds with CONFIG_NET=n.
