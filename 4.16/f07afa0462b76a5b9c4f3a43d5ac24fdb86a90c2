KVM: s390: fix memory overwrites when not using SCA entries

Even if we don't have extended SCA support, we can have more than 64 CPUs
if we don't enable any HW features that might use the SCA entries.

Now, this works just fine, but we missed a return, which is why we
would actually store the SCA entries. If we have more than 64 CPUs, this
means writing outside of the basic SCA - bad.

Let's fix this. This allows > 64 CPUs when running nested (under vSIE)
without random crashes.
