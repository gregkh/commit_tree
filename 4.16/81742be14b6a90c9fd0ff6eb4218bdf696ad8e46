media: ts2020: avoid integer overflows on 32 bit machines

Before this patch, when compiled for arm32, the signal strength
were reported as:

Lock   (0x1f) Signal= 4294908.66dBm C/N= 12.79dB

Because of a 32 bit integer overflow. After it, it is properly
reported as:

	Lock   (0x1f) Signal= -58.64dBm C/N= 12.79dB
