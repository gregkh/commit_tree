xfs: directory scrubber must walk through data block to offset

In xfs_scrub_dir_rec, we must walk through the directory block entries
to arrive at the offset given by the hash structure.  If we blindly
trust the hash address, we can end up midway into a directory entry and
stray outside the block.  Found by lastbit fuzzing lents[3].address in
xfs/390 with KASAN enabled.
