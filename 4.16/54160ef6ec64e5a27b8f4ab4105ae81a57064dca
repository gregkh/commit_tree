net: sched: sch_api: rearrange init handling

This patch fixes the following checkpatch error:

ERROR: do not use assignment in if condition

by rearranging the if condition to execute init callback only if init
callback exists. The whole setup afterwards is called in any case,
doesn't matter if init callback is set or not. This patch has the same
behaviour as before, just without assign err variable in if condition.
It also makes the code easier to read.
