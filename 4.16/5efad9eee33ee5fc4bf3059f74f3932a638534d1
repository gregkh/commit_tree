sparc,leon: Select USB_UHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_{MMIO,DESC}

Now that USB_UHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_MMIO and USB_UHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_DESC are moved
outside of the USB_SUPPORT conditional, simply select them from
SPARC_LEON rather than by the symbol's defaults in drivers/usb/Kconfig,
similar to how it is done for USB_EHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_MMIO and
USB_EHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_DESC.
