Revert "platform/chrome: chromeos_laptop: make chromeos_laptop const"

This reverts commit a376cd91606365609d8fbd57247618bd51da1fc6 because
chromeos_laptop instances should not be marked as "const" (at this
time), since i2c_peripheral is being modified (we change "state" and
"tries") when we instantiate devices.
