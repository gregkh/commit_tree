arm/arm64: smccc: Make function identifiers an unsigned quantity

Function identifiers are a 32bit, unsigned quantity. But we never
tell so to the compiler, resulting in the following:

 4ac:   b26187e0        mov     x0, #0xffffffff80000001

We thus rely on the firmware narrowing it for us, which is not
always a reasonable expectation.
