tty: make n_tty_read() always abort if hangup is in progress

A tty is hung up by __tty_hangup() setting file->f_op to
hung_up_tty_fops, which is skipped on ttys whose write operation isn't
tty_write().  This means that, for example, /dev/console whose write
op is redirected_tty_write() is never actually marked hung up.

Because n_tty_read() uses the hung up status to decide whether to
abort the waiting readers, the lack of hung-up marking can lead to the
following scenario.

 1. A session contains two processes.  The leader and its child.  The
    child ignores SIGHUP.

 2. The leader exits and starts disassociating from the controlling
    terminal (/dev/console).

 3. __tty_hangup() skips setting f_op to hung_up_tty_fops.

 4. SIGHUP is delivered and ignored.

 5. tty_ldisc_hangup() is invoked.  It wakes up the waits which should
    clear the read lockers of tty->ldisc_sem.

 6. The reader wakes up but because tty_hung_up_p() is false, it
    doesn't abort and goes back to sleep while read-holding
    tty->ldisc_sem.

 7. The leader progresses to tty_ldisc_lock() in tty_ldisc_hangup()
    and is now stuck in D sleep indefinitely waiting for
    tty->ldisc_sem.

The following is Alan's explanation on why some ttys aren't hung up.

 1. It broke the serial consoles because they would hang up and close
    down the hardware. With tty_port that *should* be fixable properly
    for any cases remaining.

 2. The console layer was (and still is) completely broken and doens't
    refcount properly. So if you turn on console hangups it breaks (as
    indeed does freeing consoles and half a dozen other things).

As neither can be fixed quickly, this patch works around the problem
by introducing a new flag, TTY_HUPPING, which is used solely to tell
n_tty_read() that hang-up is in progress for the console and the
readers should be aborted regardless of the hung-up status of the
device.

The following is a sample hung task warning caused by this issue.
