bpf: fix stacksafe exploration when comparing states

Commit cc2b14d51053 ("bpf: teach verifier to recognize zero initialized
stack") introduced a very relaxed check when comparing stacks of different
states, effectively returning a positive result in many cases where it
shouldn't.

This can create problems in cases such as this following C pseudocode:

long var;
long *x = bpf_map_lookup(...);
if (!x)
        return;

if (*x != 0xbeef)
        var = 0;
else
        var = 1;

/* This is the key part, calling a helper causes an explored state
 * to be saved with the information that "var" is on the stack as
 * STACK_ZERO, since the helper is first met by the verifier after
 * the "var = 0" assignment. This state will however be wrongly used
 * also for the "var = 1" case, so the verifier assumes "var" is always
 * 0 and will replace the NULL assignment with nops, because the
 * search pruning prevents it from exploring the faulty branch.
 */
bpf_ktime_get_ns();

if (var)
        *(long *)0 = 0xbeef;

Fix the issue by making sure that the stack is fully explored before
returning a positive comparison result.

Also attach a couple tests that highlight the bad behavior. In the first
test, without this fix instructions 16 and 17 are replaced with nops
instead of being rejected by the verifier.

The second test, instead, allows a program to make a potentially illegal
read from the stack.
