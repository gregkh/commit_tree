tools: bpftool: exit doc Makefile early if rst2man is not available

If rst2man is not available on the system, running `make doc` from the
bpftool directory fails with an error message. However, it creates empty
manual pages (.8 files in this case). A subsequent call to `make
doc-install` would then succeed and install those empty man pages on the
system.

To prevent this, raise a Makefile error and exit immediately if rst2man
is not available before generating the pages from the rst documentation.
