net/trace: fix printk format in inet_sock_set_state

There's a space character missed in the printk messages.

Put the message into one line could simplify searching for
the messages in the kernel source.

Fixes: 563e0bb0dc74("net: tracepoint: replace tcp_set_state tracepoint with inet_sock_set_state tracepoint")
