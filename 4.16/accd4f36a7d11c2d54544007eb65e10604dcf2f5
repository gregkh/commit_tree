percpu: add a schedule point in pcpu_balance_workfn()

When a large BPF percpu map is destroyed, I have seen
pcpu_balance_workfn() holding cpu for hundreds of milliseconds.

On KASAN config and 112 hyperthreads, average time to destroy a chunk
is ~4 ms.

[ 2489.841376] destroy chunk 1 in 4148689 ns
...
[ 2490.093428] destroy chunk 32 in 4072718 ns
