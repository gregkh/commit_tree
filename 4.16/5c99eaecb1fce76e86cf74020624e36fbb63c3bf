IB/mlx5: Mmap the HCA's clock info to user-space

This patch maps the new page to user space applications to
allow converting a user space completion timestamp to system wall
time at the lowest possible latency cost.
By using a versioning scheme we allow compatibility between current
and future userspace libraries.
The change moves mlx5_ib_mmap_cmd enum from mlx5_ib.h to the
abi header file mlx5-abi.h.
