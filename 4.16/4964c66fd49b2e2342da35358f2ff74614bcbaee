Revert "s390/qeth: fix using of ref counter for rxip addresses"

This reverts commit cb816192d986f7596009dedcf2201fe2e5bc2aa7.

The issue this attempted to fix never actually occurs.
l3_add_rxip() checks (via l3_ip_from_hash()) if the requested address
was previously added to the card. If so, it returns -EEXIST and doesn't
call l3_add_ip().
As a result, the "address exists" path in l3_add_ip() is never taken
for rxip addresses, and this patch had no effect.
