perf util: Introduce architecture specific errno/name mapping

Introduce a script that generates a mapping of errno numbers to their
names for each architecture that is supported by perf (i.e.  has a
subdirectory in tools/perf/arch/).

The errno mapping is generated as part of the trace beautifiers and can
be used by including the trace/beauty/arch_errno_names.c file.  Then,
use arch_syscalls__strerrno() to look up an errno value to obtain the
errno name (e.g. ENOENT) for a particular architecture.
