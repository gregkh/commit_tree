drm/amdkfd: Use ref count to prevent kfd_process destruction

Use a reference counter instead of a lock to prevent process
destruction while functions running out of process context are using
the kfd_process structure. In many cases these functions don't need
the structure to be locked. In the few cases that really do need the
process lock, take it explicitly.

This helps simplify lock dependencies between the process lock and
other locks, particularly amdgpu and mm_struct locks. This will be
important when amdgpu calls back to amdkfd for memory evictions.
