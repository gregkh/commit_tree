staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Make Tx buffer alignment optional

Aligning the Tx buffers at 64B is a performance optimization
recommendation, not a hard requirement.

Make optional the alignment of Tx FD buffers, without enforcing
a reallocation in case there is not enough headroom for it.

On Rx, we keep allocating buffers with enough headroom to allow
Tx alignment of forwarded frames.
