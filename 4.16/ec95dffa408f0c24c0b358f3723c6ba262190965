ibmvnic: queue reset when CRQ gets closed during reset

While handling a driver reset we get a H_CLOSED return trying
to send a CRQ event. When this occurs we need to queue up another
reset attempt. Without doing this we see instances where the driver
is left in a closed state because the reset failed and there is no
further attempts to reset the driver.
