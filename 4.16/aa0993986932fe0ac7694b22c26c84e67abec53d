Bluetooth: hci_ll: add support for setting public address

This adds support for setting the public address on Texas Instruments
Bluetooth chips using a vendor-specific command.

This has been tested on a CC2560A chip. The TI wiki also indicates that
this command should work on TI WL17xx/WL18xx Bluetooth chips.

During review, there was some question as to the correctness of the byte
swapping since TI's documentation is not clear on this matter. This can
be tested with the btmgmt utility from bluez. The adapter must be powered
off to change the address. If the baswap() is omitted, address is reversed.

In case there is a issue in the future, here is the output of btmon during
the command `btmgmt public-addr 00:11:22:33:44:55`:
