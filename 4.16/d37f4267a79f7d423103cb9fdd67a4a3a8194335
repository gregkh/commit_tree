kvm: vmx: Change vmcs_field_type to vmcs_field_width

Per the SDM, "[VMCS] Fields are grouped by width (16-bit, 32-bit,
etc.) and type (guest-state, host-state, etc.)." Previously, the width
was indicated by vmcs_field_type. To avoid confusion when we start
dealing with both field width and field type, change vmcs_field_type
to vmcs_field_width.
