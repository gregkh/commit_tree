signal: Move addr_lsb into the _sigfault union for clarity

The addr_lsb fields is only valid and available when the
signal is SIGBUS and the si_code is BUS_MCEERR_AR or BUS_MCEERR_AO.
Document this with a comment and place the field in the _sigfault union
to make this clear.

All of the fields stay in the same physical location so both the old
and new definitions of struct siginfo will continue to work.
