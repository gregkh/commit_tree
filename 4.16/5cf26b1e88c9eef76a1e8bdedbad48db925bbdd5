gfs2: Generalize truncate code

Pull the code for computing the range of metapointers to iterate out of
gfs2_metapath_ra (for readahead), sweep_bh_for_rgrps (for deallocating
metapointers within a block), and trunc_dealloc (for walking the
metadata tree).

In sweep_bh_for_rgrps, move the code for looking up the resource group
descriptor of the current resource group out of the inner loop.  The
metatype check moves to trunc_dealloc.
