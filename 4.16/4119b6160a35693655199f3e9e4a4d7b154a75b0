wcn36xx: set default BTLE coexistence config

If the value for the firmware configuration parameters
BTC_STATIC_LEN_LE_BT and BTC_STATIC_LEN_LE_WLAN are not set the duty
cycle between BT and WLAN is such that if BT (including BLE) is active
WLAN gets 0 bandwidth. When tuning these parameters having a too high
value for WLAN means that BLE performance degrades.
The "sweet" point of roughly half of the maximal values was empirically
found to achieve a balance between BLE and Wi-Fi coexistence
performance.
