kconfig: Document the 'menu' struct

Understanding what it represents helps a lot when reading the code, and
it's not obvious, so document it.

The ROOT_MENU flag is only set and tested by the gconf and qconf front
ends, so leave it undocumented here. The obvious guess for what it means
is correct.
