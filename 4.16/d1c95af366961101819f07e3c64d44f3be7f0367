mlxsw: spectrum_router: Do not unconditionally clear route offload indication

When mlxsw replaces (or deletes) a route it removes the offload
indication from the replaced route. This is problematic for IPv4 routes,
as the offload indication is stored in the fib_info which is usually
shared between multiple routes.

Instead of unconditionally clearing the offload indication, only clear
it if no other route is using the fib_info.
