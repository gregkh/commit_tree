media: davinci: fix a debug printk

Two orthogonal changesets caused a breakage at a printk
inside davinci. Commit a2d17962c9ca
("[media] davinci: Switch from V4L2 OF to V4L2 fwnode")
made davinci to use struct fwnode_handle instead of
struct device_node. Commit 68d9c47b1679
("media: Convert to using %pOF instead of full_name")
changed the printk to not use ->full_name, but, instead,
to rely on %pOF.

With both patches applied, the Kernel will do the wrong
thing, as warned by smatch:
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpif_capture.c:1399 vpif_async_bound() error: '%pOF' expects argument of type 'struct device_node*', argument 5 has type 'void*'

So, change the logic to actually print the device name
that was obtained before the print logic.

Fixes: 68d9c47b1679 ("media: Convert to using %pOF instead of full_name")
Fixes: a2d17962c9ca ("[media] davinci: Switch from V4L2 OF to V4L2 fwnode")
