ASoC: rsnd: Add device tree support for r8a774[35]

Document r8a774[35] specific compatible strings. The Renesas RZ/G1[ME]
(r8a774[35]) sound modules are identical to the R-Car Gen2 family.
No driver change is needed as the fallback compatible string
"renesas,rcar_sound-gen2" activates the right code in the driver.
