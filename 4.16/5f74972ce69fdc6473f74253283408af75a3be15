signal: Don't use structure initializers for struct siginfo

The siginfo structure has all manners of holes with the result that a
structure initializer is not guaranteed to initialize all of the bits.
As we have to copy the structure to userspace don't even try to use
a structure initializer.  Instead use clear_siginfo followed by initializing
selected fields.  This gives a guarantee that uninitialized kernel memory
is not copied to userspace.
