arm64: dts: marvell: replace cpm by cp0, cps by cp1

In preparation for the introduction of more than 2 CPs in upcoming
SoCs, it makes sense to move away from the "CP master" (cpm) and "CP
slave" (cps) naming, and use instead cp0/cp1.

This commit is the result of:

 sed 's%cpm%cp0g%' arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/*
 sed 's%cps%cp1g%' arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/*

So it is a purely mechaninal change.
