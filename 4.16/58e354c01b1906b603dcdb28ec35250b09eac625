net/ipv6: Handle reject routes with onlink flag

Verification of nexthops with onlink flag need to handle unreachable
routes. The lookup is only intended to validate the gateway address
is not a local address and if the gateway resolves the egress device
must match the given device. Hence, hitting any default reject route
is ok.
