net: hns3: cleanup mac auto-negotiation state query

When checking whether auto-negotiation is on, driver only needs to
check the value of mac.autoneg(SW) directly, and does not need to
query it from hardware. Because this value is always synchronized
with the auto-negotiation state of hardware.

This patch removes the mac auto-negotiation state query.
