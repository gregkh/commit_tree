tipc: simplify group LEAVE sequence

After the changes in the previous commit the group LEAVE sequence
can be simplified.

We now let the arrival of a LEAVE message unconditionally issue a group
DOWN event to the user. When a topology WITHDRAW event is received, the
member, if it still there, is set to state LEAVING, but we only issue a
group DOWN event when the link to the peer node is gone, so that no
LEAVE message is to be expected.
