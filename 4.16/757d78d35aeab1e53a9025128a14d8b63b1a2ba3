media: ddbridge: fixup checkpatch-strict issues

Fixes several alignment, braces, space-before-cast, camelcase et al issues
reported by checkpatch --strict, plus a few more checkpatch didn't report.

Three checks are left after this though:
- one CamelCase in ddbridge-core, related to defines/vars/enums referenced
  from the stv090x demod driver
- one macro argument reuse in ddbridge-core aswell
- one unbalanced braces around else in ddbridge-main, which is due to
  #ifdefs related to CONFIG_PCI_MSI, which preferrably should be kept
  as-is for readability.
