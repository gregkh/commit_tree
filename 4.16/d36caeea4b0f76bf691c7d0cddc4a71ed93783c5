drm/i915: Assert vma->flags are updated correctly during binding

As we bind, and unbind on error, we want to be sure that the vma->flags
are updated to reflect the binding state so that on the next invocation
all is well.

v2: Take two.
v3: Take three; vma-misplaced is checking map-and-fenceable so keep it
last!
