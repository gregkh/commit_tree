usb: host: xhci-plat: revert "usb: host: xhci-plat: enable clk in resume timing"

This patch reverts the commit 835e4241e714 ("usb: host: xhci-plat:
enable clk in resume timing") because this driver also has runtime PM
and the commit 560869100b99 ("clk: renesas: cpg-mssr: Restore module
clocks during resume") will restore the clock on R-Car H3 environment.

If the xhci_plat_suspend() disables the clk, the system cannot enable
the clk in resume like the following behavior:

< In resume >
 - genpd_resume_noirq() runs and enable the clk (enable_count = 1)
 - cpg_mssr_resume_noirq() restores the clk register.
  -- Since the clk was disabled in suspend, cpg_mssr_resume_noirq()
     will disable the clk and keep the enable_count.
 - Even if xhci_plat_resume() calls clk_prepare_enable(), since
   the enable_count is 1, the clk will be not enabled.

After this patch is applied, the cpg-mssr driver will save the clk
as enable, so the clk will be enabled in resume.
