staging: lustre: replace LIBCFS_CPT_ALLOC()

LIBCFS_APT_ALLOC() calls kvmalloc_node() with GFP_NOFS
which is not permitted.
Mostly, a kmalloc_node(GFP_NOFS) is appropriate, though occasionally
the allocation is large and GFP_KERNEL is acceptable, so
kvmalloc_node() can be used.

This patch introduces 4 alternatives to LIBCFS_CPT_ALLOC():
 kmalloc_cpt()
 kzalloc_cpt()
 kvmalloc_cpt()
 kvzalloc_cpt().

Each takes a size, gfp flags, and cpt number.

Almost every call to LIBCFS_CPT_ALLOC() passes lnet_cpt_table()
as the table.  This patch embeds that choice in the k*alloc_cpt()
macros, and opencode kzalloc_node(..., cfs_cpt_spread_node(..))
in the one case that lnet_cpt_table() isn't used.

When LIBCFS_CPT_ALLOC() is replaced, the matching LIBCFS_FREE()
is also replaced, with with kfree() or kvfree() as appropriate.
