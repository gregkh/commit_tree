net: sched: tbf: handle GSO_BY_FRAGS case in enqueue

tbf_enqueue() checks the size of a packet before enqueuing it.
However, the GSO size check does not consider the GSO_BY_FRAGS
case, and so will drop GSO SCTP packets, causing a massive drop
in throughput.

Use skb_gso_validate_mac_len() instead, as it does consider that
case.
