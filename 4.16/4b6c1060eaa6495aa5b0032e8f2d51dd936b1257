md: fix md_write_start() deadlock w/o metadata devices

If no metadata devices are configured on raid1/4/5/6/10
(e.g. via dm-raid), md_write_start() unconditionally waits
for superblocks to be written thus deadlocking.

Fix introduces mddev->has_superblocks bool, defines it in md_run()
and checks for it in md_write_start() to conditionally avoid waiting.

Once on it, check for non-existing superblocks in md_super_write().
