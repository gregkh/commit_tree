genirq/matrix: Handle CPU offlining proper

At CPU hotunplug the corresponding per cpu matrix allocator is shut down and
the allocated interrupt bits are discarded under the assumption that all
allocated bits have been either migrated away or shut down through the
managed interrupts mechanism.

This is not true because interrupts which are not started up might have a
vector allocated on the outgoing CPU. When the interrupt is started up
later or completely shutdown and freed then the allocated vector is handed
back, triggering warnings or causing accounting issues which result in
suspend failures and other issues.

Change the CPU hotplug mechanism of the matrix allocator so that the
remaining allocations at unplug time are preserved and global accounting at
hotplug is correctly readjusted to take the dormant vectors into account.
