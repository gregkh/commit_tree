ovl: lookup indexed ancestor of lower dir

ovl_lookup_real() in lower layer walks back lower parents to find the
topmost indexed parent. If an indexed ancestor is found before reaching
lower layer root, ovl_lookup_real() is called recursively with upper
layer to walk back from indexed upper to the topmost connected/hashed
upper parent (or up to root).

ovl_lookup_real() in upper layer then walks forward to connect the topmost
upper overlay dir dentry and ovl_lookup_real() in lower layer continues to
walk forward to connect the decoded lower overlay dir dentry.
