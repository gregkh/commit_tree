lan78xx: remove redundant initialization of pointer 'phydev'

Pointer phydev is initialized and this value is never read, phydev
is immediately updated to a new value, hence this initialization
is redundant and can be removed

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/net/usb/lan78xx.c:2009:21: warning: Value stored to 'phydev'
during its initialization is never read
