usb: xhci: allow imod-interval to be configurable

The xHCI driver currently has the IMOD set to 160, which
translates to an IMOD interval of 40,000ns (160 * 250)ns

Commit 0cbd4b34cda9 ("xhci: mediatek: support MTK xHCI host controller")
introduced a QUIRK for the MTK platform to adjust this interval to 20,
which translates to an IMOD interval of 5,000ns (20 * 250)ns. This is
due to the fact that the MTK controller IMOD interval is 8 times
as much as defined in xHCI spec.

Instead of adding more quirk bits for additional platforms, this patch
introduces the ability for vendors to set the IMOD_INTERVAL as is
optimal for their platform. By using device_property_read_u32() on
"imod-interval-ns", the IMOD INTERVAL can be specified in nano seconds.
If no interval is specified, the default of 40,000ns (IMOD=160) will be
used.

No bounds checking has been implemented due to the fact that a vendor
may have violated the spec and would need to specify a value outside of
the max 8,000 IRQs/second limit specified in the xHCI spec.
