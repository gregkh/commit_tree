brcmfmac: assure bcdc dcmd api does not return value > 0

The protocol layer api defines callbacks for dongle commands.
Although not really well documented these should only return an
error code in case of an error, or 0 upon success. In the bcdc
protocol it can return value above 0 and we carry a fix in the
caller of the protocol layer api. This patch makes it adhere to
the intent of the api as described above.
