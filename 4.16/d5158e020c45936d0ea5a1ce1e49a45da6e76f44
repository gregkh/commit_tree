HID: Ignore Jabra HID interface based on firmware version

Two Jabra speakerphone devices were added to the ignore list in 2013,
because the device HID interfaces didn't work well with kernel usbhid
driver, and could cause volume key event storm.

See the original commit:
Commit 31b9779cb292 ("HID: ignore Jabra speakerphones HID interface")

Modify hid_lookup_quirk() to consider the firmware version of these two
devices, so that only versions older than a known good version are
ignored.
