regmap: allow to disable all locking mechanisms

We have a use case in the at24 EEPROM driver (recently converted to
using regmap instead of raw i2c/smbus calls) where we read from/write
to the regmap in a loop, while protecting the entire loop with
a mutex.

Currently this implicitly makes us use two mutexes - one in the driver
and one in regmap. While browsing the code for similar use cases I
noticed a significant number of places where locking *seems* redundant.

Allow users to completely disable any locking mechanisms in regmap
config.
