KVM: arm64: Stop save/restoring host tpidr_el1 on VHE

Now that a VHE host uses tpidr_el2 for the cpu offset we no longer
need KVM to save/restore tpidr_el1. Move this from the 'common' code
into the non-vhe code. While we're at it, on VHE we don't need to
save the ELR or SPSR as kernel_entry in entry.S will have pushed these
onto the kernel stack, and will restore them from there. Move these
to the non-vhe code as we need them to get back to the host.

Finally remove the always-copy-tpidr we hid in the stage2 setup
code, cpufeature's enable callback will do this for VHE, we only
need KVM to do it for non-vhe. Add the copy into kvm-init instead.
