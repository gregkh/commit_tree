Revert "arm64: KVM: Hide PMU from guests when disabled"

Commit 0c0543a128bd1c6a4c8610d0d9d869053fa2fbf5 breaks migration and
introduces a regression with existing userspace because it introduces an
ordering requirement of setting up all VCPU features before writing ID
registers which we didn't have before.

Revert this commit for now until we have a proper fix.
