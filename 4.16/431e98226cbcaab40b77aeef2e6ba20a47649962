btrfs: move some zstd work data from stack to workspace

* ZSTD_inBuffer in_buf
* ZSTD_outBuffer out_buf

are used in all functions to pass the compression parameters and the
local variables consume some space. We can move them to the workspace
and reduce the stack consumption:

zstd.c:zstd_decompress                        -24 (136 -> 112)
zstd.c:zstd_decompress_bio                    -24 (144 -> 120)
zstd.c:zstd_compress_pages                    -24 (264 -> 240)
