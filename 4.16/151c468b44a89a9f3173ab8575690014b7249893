scripts: kernel-doc: print the declaration name on warnings

The logic at create_parameterlist()'s ancillary push_parameter()
function has already a way to output the declaration name, with
would help to discover what declaration is missing.

However, currently, the logic is utterly broken, as it uses
the var $type with a wrong meaning. With the current code,
it will never print anything. I suspect that originally
it was using the second argument of output_declaration().

I opted to not rely on a globally defined $declaration_name,
but, instead, to pass it explicitly as a parameter.

While here, I removed a unaligned check for !$anon_struct_union.
This is not needed, as, if $anon_struct_union is not zero,
$parameterdescs{$param} will be defined.
