rtc: mxc_v2: remove __exit annotation

The mxc_rtc_remove is incorrectly annotated as __exit:

`mxc_rtc_remove' referenced in section `.data' of drivers/rtc/rtc-mxc_v2.o: defined in discarded section `.exit.text' of drivers/rtc/rtc-mxc_v2.o

This should not be done, as devices can be dynamically bound
and unbound to a driver.
