ACPI: button: Add a LID switch blacklist and add 1 model to it

The GP-electronic T701 tablet does not have a LID switch, but it
does define a LID device in its DSDT. The _LID method points to
the "\\_SB.GPO2" pin 0x18 GPIO with a pull setting of "PullDefault",
which leaves the pin floating.

This causes the ACPI button driver to cause spurious LID closed events,
causing the device to suspend while the user is using it. There is
nothing the ACPI button driver (or the gpio code) can do to fix this,
so the only solution is to add a DMI based blacklist and ignore the LID
device on these tablets.
