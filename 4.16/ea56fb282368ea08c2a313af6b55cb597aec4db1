mtd: nand: vf610: set correct ooblayout

With commit 3cf32d180227 ("mtd: nand: vf610: switch to
mtd_ooblayout_ops") the driver started to use the NAND cores
default large page ooblayout. However, shortly after commit
6a623e076944 ("mtd: nand: add ooblayout for old hamming layout")
changed the default layout to the old hamming layout, which is
not what vf610_nfc is using. Specify the default large page
layout explicitly.
