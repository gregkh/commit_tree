tipc: some clarifying name changes

We rename some functions and variables, to make their purpose clearer.

- tipc_group::congested -> tipc_group::small_win. Members in this list
  are not necessarily (and typically) congested. Instead, they may
  *potentially* be subject to congestion because their send window is
  less than ADV_IDLE, and therefore need to be checked during message
  transmission.

- tipc_group_is_receiver() -> tipc_group_is_sender(). This socket will
  accept messages coming from members fulfilling this condition, i.e.,
  they are senders from this member's viewpoint.

- tipc_group_is_enabled() -> tipc_group_is_receiver(). Members
  fulfilling this condition will accept messages sent from the current
  socket, i.e., they are receivers from its viewpoint.

There are no functional changes in this commit.
