drm/etnaviv: simplify submit_create

Use kzalloc so other code doesn't need to worry about uninitialized members.
Drop the non-standard GFP flags, as we really don't want to fail the submit
when under slight memory pressure. Remove one level of indentation by using
an early return if the allocation failed. Also remove the unused drm device
member.
