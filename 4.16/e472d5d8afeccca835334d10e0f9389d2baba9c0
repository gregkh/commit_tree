bpf, mips64: remove unneeded zero check from div/mod with k

The verifier in both cBPF and eBPF reject div/mod by 0 imm,
so this can never load. Remove emitting such test and reject
it from being JITed instead (the latter is actually also not
needed, but given practice in sparc64, ppc64 today, so
doesn't hurt to add it here either).
