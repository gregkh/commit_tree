serial: core: mark port as initialized in autoconfig

This is a followup on 44117a1d1732 ("serial: core: mark port as
initialized after successful IRQ change").
Nikola has been using autoconfig via setserial and reported a crash
similar to what I fixed in the earlier mentioned commit. Here I do the
same fixup for the autoconfig. I wasn't sure that this is the right
approach. Nikola confirmed that it fixes his crash.
