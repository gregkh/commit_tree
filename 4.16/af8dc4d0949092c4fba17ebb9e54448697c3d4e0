HID: multitouch: Properly deal with Win8 PTP reports with 0 touches

The Windows Precision Touchpad spec "Figure 4 Button Only Down and Up"
and "Table 9 Report Sequence for Button Only Down and Up" indicate
that the first packet of a (possibly hybrid mode multi-packet) frame
may contain a contact-count of 0 if only a button is pressed and no
fingers are detected.

This means that a value of 0 for contact-count is a valid value and
should be used as expected contact count when it is the first packet
(num_received == 0), as extra check to make sure that this is the first
packet of a buttons only frame, we also check that the timestamp is
different.
