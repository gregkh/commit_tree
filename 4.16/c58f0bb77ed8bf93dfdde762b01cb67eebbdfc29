asm-generic: provide generic_pmdp_establish()

Patch series "Do not lose dirty bit on THP pages", v4.

Vlastimil noted that pmdp_invalidate() is not atomic and we can lose
dirty and access bits if CPU sets them after pmdp dereference, but
before set_pmd_at().

The bug can lead to data loss, but the race window is tiny and I haven't
seen any reports that suggested that it happens in reality.  So I don't
think it worth sending it to stable.

Unfortunately, there's no way to address the issue in a generic way.  We
need to fix all architectures that support THP one-by-one.

All architectures that have THP supported have to provide atomic
pmdp_invalidate() that returns previous value.

If generic implementation of pmdp_invalidate() is used, architecture
needs to provide atomic pmdp_estabish().

pmdp_estabish() is not used out-side generic implementation of
pmdp_invalidate() so far, but I think this can change in the future.

This patch (of 12):

This is an implementation of pmdp_establish() that is only suitable for
an architecture that doesn't have hardware dirty/accessed bits.  In this
case we can't race with CPU which sets these bits and non-atomic
approach is fine.
