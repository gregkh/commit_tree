ixgbe: Assume provided MAC filter has been verified by macvlan

The macvlan driver itself will validate the MAC address that is configured
for a given interface. There is no need for us to verify it again.

Instead we should be checking to verify that we actually allocate the filter
and have not run out of resources to configure a MAC rule in our filter
table.
