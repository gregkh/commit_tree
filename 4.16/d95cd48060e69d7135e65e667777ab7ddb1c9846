i40e: Fix for blinking activity instead of link LEDs

This fix solves an issue occurring while calling i40e_led_set function
from the driver with "blink" parameter set as TRUE. This call resulted
in Activity LED blinking instead of Link LED, which may lead to errors
in physically identifying the port, since Activity LED may be blinking
for different reasons as well.
