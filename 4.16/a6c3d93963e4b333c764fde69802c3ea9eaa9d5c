s390/qeth: on channel error, reject further cmd requests

When the IRQ handler determines that one of the cmd IO channels has
failed and schedules recovery, block any further cmd requests from
being submitted. The request would inevitably stall, and prevent the
recovery from making progress until the request times out.

This sort of error was observed after Live Guest Relocation, where
the pending IO on the READ channel intentionally gets terminated to
kick-start recovery. Simultaneously the guest executed SIOCETHTOOL,
triggering qeth to issue a QUERY CARD INFO command. The command
then stalled in the inoperabel WRITE channel.
