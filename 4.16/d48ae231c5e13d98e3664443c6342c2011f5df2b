nfp: bpf: add basic control channel communication

For map support we will need to send and receive control messages.
Add basic support for sending a message to FW, and waiting for a
reply.

Control messages are tagged with a 16 bit ID.  Add a simple ID
allocator and make sure we don't allow too many messages in flight,
to avoid request <> reply mismatches.
