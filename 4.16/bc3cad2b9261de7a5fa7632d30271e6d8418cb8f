media: qt1010: fix bogus warnings

The logic at qt1010_init_meas1() and qt1010_init_meas2()
are too complex for static analizers to identify that
some vars are always be initialized.

That causes smatch to produce the following warnings:
	drivers/media/tuners/qt1010.c:248 qt1010_init_meas1() error: uninitialized symbol 'val2'.
	drivers/media/tuners/qt1010.c:282 qt1010_init_meas2() error: uninitialized symbol 'val'.

So, add annotations to prevent those bogus warnings.
