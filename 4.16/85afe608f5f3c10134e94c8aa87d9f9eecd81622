scripts: kernel_doc: better handle show warnings logic

The logic with inhibits warnings for definitions that is not
output is incomplete: it doesn't cover the cases where
OUTPUT_INTERNAL and OUTPUT_EXPORTED are used.

As the most common case is OUTPUT_ALL, place it first,
in order to optimize a litte bit the check logic.
