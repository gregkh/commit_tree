dm: use blkdev_get rather than bdgrab when issuing pass-through ioctl

Otherwise an underlying device's teardown (e.g. SCSI) may race with the
DM ioctl or persistent reservation and result in dereferencing driver
memory that gets freed when the underlying device's final blkdev_put()
occurs.

bdgrab() only increases the refcount for the block_device's inode to
ensure the block_device struct itself will not be freed, but does not
guarantee the block_device will remain associated with the gendisk or
its storage.
