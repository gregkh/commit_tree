nfp: bpf: don't depend on high order allocations for program image

The translator pre-allocates a buffer of maximal program size.
Due to HW/FW limitations the program buffer can't currently be
longer than 128Kb, so we used to kmalloc() it, and then map for
DMA directly.

Now that the late branch resolution is copying the program image
anyway, we can just kvmalloc() the buffer.  While at it, after
translation reallocate the buffer to save space.
