IB/mlx5: Add support for DC target QP

A DC Target (DCT) QP is represented in the hardware as a unique object.
This object is created by CREATE_DCT command and destroyed by DESTROY_DCT
command. However, in the driver we describe it as a QP.

The hardware command that creates a DCT needs parameters that the verb
create_qp() does not provide. Those remaining parameters are provided
with the call to the verb modify_qp(). Therefore we delay the actual
creation of a DCT in the hardware until the stage of modify_qp() to RTR.

A support for query_qp() was added as well. It uses QUERY_DCT command to
retrieve the applicable fields.
