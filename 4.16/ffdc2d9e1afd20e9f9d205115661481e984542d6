cls_u32: Reinstate cyclic allocation

Commit e7614370d6f0 ("net_sched: use idr to allocate u32 filter handles)
converted htid allocation to use the IDR.  The ID allocated by this
scheme changes; it used to be cyclic, but now always allocates the
lowest available.  The IDR supports cyclic allocation, so just use
the right function.
