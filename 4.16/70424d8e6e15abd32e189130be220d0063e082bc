ASoC: nau8825: improve semaphore control

After reviewing the crosstalk protection, there are two flaws at
semaphore control. The first one is that the semaphore releases are
not enough; and the other is that down_interruptible has an risk to
make the ISR sleep.
Therefore, the driver add more releases before the funcitons return.
Take down_trylock to replace down_interruptible. The ISR can control
the protection as well and never sleep by semaphore.
