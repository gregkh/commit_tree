checkpatch: avoid some false positives for TABSTOP declaration test

Using an open bracket after what seems to be a declaration can also be a
function definition and declaration argument line continuation so remove
the open bracket from the possible declaration/definition matching.

e.g.:
	int foobar(int a;
		   int *b[]);
