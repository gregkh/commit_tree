genirq/affinity: assign vectors to all possible CPUs

Currently we assign managed interrupt vectors to all present CPUs.  This
works fine for systems were we only online/offline CPUs.  But in case of
systems that support physical CPU hotplug (or the virtualized version of
it) this means the additional CPUs covered for in the ACPI tables or on
the command line are not catered for.  To fix this we'd either need to
introduce new hotplug CPU states just for this case, or we can start
assining vectors to possible but not present CPUs.
