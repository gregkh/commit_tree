crypto: ecc - Fix NULL pointer deref. on no default_rng

If crypto_get_default_rng returns an error, the
function ecc_gen_privkey should return an error.
Instead, it currently tries to use the default_rng
nevertheless, thus creating a kernel panic with a
NULL pointer dereference.
Returning the error directly, as was supposedly
intended when looking at the code, fixes this.
