wil6210: configure OTP HW vectors in SW reset flow

OTP HW vectors values are different for 40MHz and 330MHz AHB
clocks.
In SW reset flow, the host driver sets the clock frequency
to 40MHz. In order to allow reading from the OTP, the host
driver should configure the OTP HW vectors with the values
that fits this clock frequency.
