drm/i915/guc: Add uc_fini_wq in gem_init unwind path

While moving code around for solving lockdep issue for GuC log relay,
spotted that uc_fini_wq is not being called in failure path in gem_init.
Missed in the below commit. Add it.

v2: Removed GEM_BUG_ON(!HAS_GUC()) from intel_uc_fini_wq as init happens
only based on enable_guc module parameter and does not consider has_guc
capability. (Michal)
