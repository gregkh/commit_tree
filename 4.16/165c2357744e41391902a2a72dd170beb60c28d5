power: supply: axp288_charger: Properly stop work on probe-error / remove

Properly stop any work we may have queued on probe-errors / remove.

Rather then adding a remove driver callback for this, and goto style
error handling to probe, use a devm_action for this.

The devm_action gets registered before we register any of the extcon
notifiers which may queue the work, devm does cleanup in reverse order,
so this ensures that the notifiers are removed before we cancel the work.
