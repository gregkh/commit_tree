Bluetooth: btbcm: Fix sleep mode struct ordering

According to the documentation for Laird SD40 radio modules (which use
the BCM4329 chipset), the order of the Enable_BREAK_To_Host and
Pulsed_HOST_WAKE parameters in the sleep mode struct is reversed
vis-Ã -vis our struct declaration.  See page 46 of this PDF:

The documentation is dated Oct 2015, so fairly recent, making it appear
more likely that the documentation is correct and our code is wrong.
Amend our code to be in congruence with the documentation.
