mm: de-indent struct page

I found the struct { union { struct { union { struct { } } } } } layout
rather confusing.  Fortunately, there is an easier way to write this.

The innermost union is of four things which are the size of an int, so
the ones which are used by slab/slob/slub can be pulled up two levels to
be in the outermost union with 'counters'.  That leaves us with struct {
union { struct { atomic_t; atomic_t; } } } which has the same layout,
but is easier to read.

Output from the current git version of pahole, diffed with -uw to ignore
the whitespace changes from the indentation:
