net: thunder: change q_len's type to handle max ring size

The Cavium thunder nicvf driver supports rx/tx rings of up to 65536 entries per.
The number of entires are stored in the q_len member of struct q_desc_mem. The
problem is that q_len being a u16, results in 65536 becoming 0.

In getting pointers to descriptors in the rings, the driver uses q_len minus 1
as a mask after incrementing the pointer, in order to go back to the beginning
and not go past the end of the ring.

With the q_len set to 0 the mask is no longer correct and the driver does go
beyond the end of the ring, causing various ills. Usually the first thing that
shows up is a "NETDEV WATCHDOG: enP2p1s0f1 (nicvf): transmit queue 7 timed out"
warning.

This patch remedies the problem by changing q_len to a u32.
