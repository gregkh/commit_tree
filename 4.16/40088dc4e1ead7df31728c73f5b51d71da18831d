ALSA: hda - Revert power_save option default value

With the commit 1ba8f9d30817 ("ALSA: hda: Add a power_save
blacklist"), we changed the default value of power_save option to -1
for processing the power-save blacklist.
Unfortunately, this seems breaking user-space applications that
actually read the power_save parameter value via sysfs and judge /
adjust the power-saving status.  They see the value -1 as if the
power-save is turned off, although the actual value is taken from
CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT and it can be a positive.

So, overall, passing -1 there was no good idea.  Let's partially
revert it -- at least for power_save option default value is restored
again to CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT.  Meanwhile, in this patch,
we keep the blacklist behavior and make is adjustable via the new
option, pm_blacklist.
