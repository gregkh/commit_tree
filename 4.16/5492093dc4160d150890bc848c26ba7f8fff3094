xfrm: Stop using dst->next in bundle construction.

While building ipsec bundles, blocks of xfrm dsts are linked together
using dst->next from bottom to the top.

The only thing this is used for is initializing the pmtu values of the
xfrm stack, and for updating the mtu values at xfrm_bundle_ok() time.

The bundle pmtu entries must be processed in this order so that pmtu
values lower in the stack of routes can propagate up to the higher
ones.

Avoid using dst->next by simply maintaining an array of dst pointers
as we already do for the xfrm_state objects when building the bundle.
