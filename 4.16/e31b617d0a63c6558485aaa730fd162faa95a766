staging: iio: adc: ad7192: fix external frequency setting

The external clock frequency was set only when selecting
the internal clock, which is fixed at 4.9152 Mhz.

This is incorrect, since it should be set when any of
the external clock or crystal settings is selected.

Added range validation for the external (crystal/clock)
frequency setting.
Valid values are between 2.4576 and 5.12 Mhz.
