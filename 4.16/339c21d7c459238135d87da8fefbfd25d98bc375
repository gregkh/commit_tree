net: sched: fix tc_u_common lookup

The offending commit wrongly assumes 1:1 mapping between block and q.
However, there are multiple blocks for a single q for classful qdiscs.
Since the obscure tc_u_common sharing mechanism expects it to be shared
among a qdisc, fix it by storing q pointer in case the block is not
shared.
