mlxsw: spectrum: qdiscs: Unite all handle checks

Every qdisc op gets the qdisc handle ID as well as its location.  Each one
of them, beside replace, checks if the handle doesn't match the qdisc in
the given location, and if so, it returns without running the actual op.
Unite these checks to one comparison function and avoid sending the handle
id to these ops.
