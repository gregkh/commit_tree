bpf: Add BPF_SOCK_OPS_RETRANS_CB

Adds support for calling sock_ops BPF program when there is a
retransmission. Three arguments are used; one for the sequence number,
another for the number of segments retransmitted, and the last one for
the return value of tcp_transmit_skb (0 => success).
Does not include syn-ack retransmissions.

New op: BPF_SOCK_OPS_RETRANS_CB.
