scsi: bfa: convert to strlcpy/strlcat

The bfa driver has a number of real issues with string termination
that gcc-8 now points out:

In most cases, this can be addressed by correctly calling strlcpy and
strlcat instead of strncpy/strncat, with the size of the destination
buffer as the last argument.

For consistency, I'm changing the other callers of strncpy() in this
driver the same way.
