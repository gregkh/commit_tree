rcu: Simplify rcu_eqs_{enter,exit}() non-idle task debug code

The code that checks for non-idle non-nohz_idle-usermode tasks invoking
rcu_eqs_enter() and rcu_eqs_exit() prints a considerable quantity of
helpful information.  However, these checks fire rarely, so the extra
complexity is no longer worth it.  This commit therefore replaces this
debug code with simple WARN_ON_ONCE() statements.
