fscrypt: fix build with pre-4.6 gcc versions

gcc versions prior to 4.6 require an extra level of braces when using a
designated initializer for a member in an anonymous struct or union.
This caused a compile error with the 'struct qstr' initialization in
__fscrypt_encrypt_symlink().

Fix it by using QSTR_INIT().
