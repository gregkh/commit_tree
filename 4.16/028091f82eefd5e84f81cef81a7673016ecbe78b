x86/platform/intel-mid: Handle Intel Edison reboot correctly

When the Intel Edison module is powered with 3.3V, the reboot command makes
the module stuck.  If the module is powered at a greater voltage, like 4.4V
(as the Edison Mini Breakout board does), reboot works OK.

The official Intel Edison BSP sends the IPCMSG_COLD_RESET message to the
SCU by default. The IPCMSG_COLD_BOOT which is used by the upstream kernel
is only sent when explicitely selected on the kernel command line.

Use IPCMSG_COLD_RESET unconditionally which makes reboot work independent
of the power supply voltage.
