ARM: imx: dts: Use lower case for bindings notation

Improve the DTS files using lower case to fix the following dtc warnings:

Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /XXX@<UPPER> simple-bus unit address format error, expected "<lower>"

Converted using the following command:

find . -type f \( -iname *.dts -o -iname *.dtsi \) -exec sed -i -e "s/@\([0-9a-fA-FxX\.;:#]+\)\s*{/@\L\1 {/g" -e "s/@0x\(.*\) {/@\1 {/g" -e "s/@0+\(.*\) {/@\1 {/g" {} +^C

For simplicity, two sed expressions were used to solve each warnings separately.

To make the regex expression more robust a few other issues were resolved,
namely setting unit-address to lower case, and adding a whitespace before the
the opening curly brace:

This is a follow up to commit 4c9847b7375a ("dt-bindings: Remove leading 0x from bindings notation")
