mm, thp: do not cause memcg oom for thp

Commit 2516035499b9 ("mm, thp: remove __GFP_NORETRY from khugepaged and
madvised allocations") changed the page allocator to no longer detect
thp allocations based on __GFP_NORETRY.

It did not, however, modify the mem cgroup try_charge() path to avoid
oom kill for either khugepaged collapsing or thp faulting.  It is never
expected to oom kill a process to allocate a hugepage for thp; reclaim
is governed by the thp defrag mode and MADV_HUGEPAGE, but allocations
(and charging) should fallback instead of oom killing processes.
