ARM: dts: imx6ul-14x14-evk: Move regulators out of simple-bus

It is not recommended to place regulator nodes inside simple-bus, so
move them out in order to fix the following build warnings with W=1:

arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6ul-14x14-evk.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /regulators/sd1_regulator missing or empty reg/ranges property
