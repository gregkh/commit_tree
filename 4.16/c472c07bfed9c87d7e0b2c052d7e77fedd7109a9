iversion: Rename make inode_cmp_iversion{+raw} to inode_eq_iversion{+raw}

The function inode_cmp_iversion{+raw} is counter-intuitive, because it
returns true when the counters are different and false when these are equal.

Rename it to inode_eq_iversion{+raw}, which will returns true when
the counters are equal and false otherwise.
