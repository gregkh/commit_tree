net/mlx5e: Change Mellanox references in DIM code

Change all appropriate mlx5_am* and MLX5_AM* references to net_dim and
NET_DIM, respectively, in code that handles dynamic interrupt
moderation.  Also change all references from 'am' to 'dim' when used as
local variables and add generic profile references.
