powerpc/64: Improve inline asm in arch_local_irq_disable

arch_local_irq_disable is implemented strangely, with a temporary
output register being set to the desired soft_enabled value via an
immediate input, which is then used to store to memory. This is not
required, the immediate can be specified directly as a register input.

For simple cases at least, assembly is unchanged except register
mapping.
