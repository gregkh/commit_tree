arm64: Add vmap_stack header file

Today the arm64 arch code allocates an extra IRQ stack per-cpu. If we
also have SDEI and VMAP stacks we need two extra per-cpu VMAP stacks.

Move the VMAP stack allocation out to a helper in a new header file.
This avoids missing THREADINFO_GFP, or getting the all-important alignment
wrong.
