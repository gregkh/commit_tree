gpio: serial: max310x: Support open-drain configuration for GPIOs

The push-pull vs. open-drain are the only supported output modes. The
inputs are always unconditionally equipped with weak pull-downs. That's
the only mode, so there's probably no point in exporting that. I wonder
if it's worthwhile to provide a custom dbg_show method to indicate the
current status of the outputs, though.

This patch and [1] for i2c-gpio together make it possible to bit-bang an
I2C bus over GPIOs of an UART which is connected via SPI :). Yes, this
is crazy, but it's fast enough (while on a 26Mhz SPI HW bus with a
dual-core 1.6GHz CPU) to drive an I2C bus at 200kHz, according to my
scope.
