drm/sun4i: rgb: Fix potential division by zero

In the case where mode_valid callback of our RGB connector was called
before mode_set was being called, the range of dividers would not be set,
resulting in a division by zero later on in the clk_round_rate logic.

Set the range of dividers before calling clk_round_rate to fix this.
