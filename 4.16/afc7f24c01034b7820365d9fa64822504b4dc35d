media: rc: i2c: set parent of rc device and improve name

With the parent set for the rc device, the messages clearly state
that it is attached via i2c. The additional printk is unnecessary.

These are the old messages:

rc rc1: i2c IR (Hauppauge WinTV PVR-150 as /devices/virtual/rc/rc1
ir-kbd-i2c: i2c IR (Hauppauge WinTV PVR-150 detected at i2c-10/10-0071/ir0 [ivtv i2c driver #0]

Now we simply get:

rc rc1: Hauppauge WinTV PVR-150 as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:00.0/i2c-10/10-0071/rc/rc1

Note that we no longer copy the name. I've checked all call sites
to verfiy this is not a problem.
