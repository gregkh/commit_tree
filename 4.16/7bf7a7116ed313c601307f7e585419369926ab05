media: dvb-usb-v2: lmedm04: move ts2020 attach to dm04_lme2510_tuner

When the tuner was split from m88rs2000 the attach function is in wrong
place.

Move to dm04_lme2510_tuner to trap errors on failure and removing
a call to lme_coldreset.

Prevents driver starting up without any tuner connected.

Fixes to trap for ts2020 fail.
LME2510(C): FE Found M88RS2000
ts2020: probe of 0-0060 failed with error -11
...
LME2510(C): TUN Found RS2000 tuner
