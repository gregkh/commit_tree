nfp: bpf: require ETH table

Upcoming changes will require all netdevs supporting TC offloads
to have a full struct nfp_port.  Require those for BPF offload.
The operation without management FW reporting information about
Ethernet ports is something we only support for very old and very
basic NIC firmwares anyway.
