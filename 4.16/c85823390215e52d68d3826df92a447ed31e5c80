gpio: of: Support SPI nonstandard GPIO properties

Before it was clearly established that all GPIO properties in the
device tree shall be named "foo-gpios" (with the deprecated variant
"foo-gpio" for single lines) we unfortunately merged a few bindings
which named the lines "gpio-foo" instead.

This is most prominent in the GPIO SPI driver in Linux which names
the lines "gpio-sck", "gpio-mosi" and "gpio-miso".

As we want to switch the GPIO SPI driver to using descriptors, we
need devm_gpiod_get() to return something reasonable when looking
up these in the device tree.

Put in a special #ifdef:ed kludge to do this special lookup only
for the SPI case and gets compiled out if we're not enabling SPI.
If we have more oddly defined legacy GPIOs like this, they can be
handled in a similar manner.
