spi: spi-fsl-dspi: account for const type of of_device_id.data

This driver creates a number of const structures that it stores in the
data field of an of_device_id array.

The data field of an of_device_id structure has type const void *, so
there is no need for a const-discarding cast when putting const values
into such a structure.

Done using Coccinelle.
