media: vb2: Enforce VB2_MAX_FRAME in vb2_core_reqbufs better

The check for the number of buffers requested against the maximum,
VB2_MAX_FRAME, was performed before checking queue's minimum number of
buffers. Reverse the order, thus ensuring that under no circumstances
num_buffers exceeds VB2_MAX_FRAME here.

Also add a warning of the condition.
