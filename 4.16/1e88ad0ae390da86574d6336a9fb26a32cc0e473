drm/amd/display: remove usage of legacy_cursor_update

Currently the atomic check code uses legacy_cursor_update
to differnetiate if the cursor plane is being requested by
the user, which is not required as we shall be updating
plane only if modeset is requested/required.

Have tested cursor plane and underlay get updated seamlessly,
without any lag or frame drops.
