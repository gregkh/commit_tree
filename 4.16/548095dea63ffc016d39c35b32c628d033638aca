locking: Remove smp_read_barrier_depends() from queued_spin_lock_slowpath()

Queued spinlocks are not used by DEC Alpha, and furthermore operations
such as READ_ONCE() and release/relaxed RMW atomics are being changed
to imply smp_read_barrier_depends().  This commit therefore removes the
now-redundant smp_read_barrier_depends() from queued_spin_lock_slowpath(),
and adjusts the comments accordingly.
