smc: support variable CLC proposal messages

According to RFC7609 [1] the CLC proposal message contains an area of
unknown length for future growth. Additionally it may contain up to
8 IPv6 prefixes. The current version of the SMC-code does not
understand CLC proposal messages using these variable length fields and,
thus, is incompatible with SMC implementations in other operating
systems.

This patch makes sure, SMC understands incoming CLC proposals
* with arbitrary length values for future growth
* with up to 8 IPv6 prefixes
