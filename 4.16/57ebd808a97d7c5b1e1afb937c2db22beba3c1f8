netfilter: add back stackpointer size checks

The rationale for removing the check is only correct for rulesets
generated by ip(6)tables.

In iptables, a jump can only occur to a user-defined chain, i.e.
because we size the stack based on number of user-defined chains we
cannot exceed stack size.

However, the underlying binary format has no such restriction,
and the validation step only ensures that the jump target is a
valid rule start point.

IOW, its possible to build a rule blob that has no user-defined
chains but does contain a jump.

If this happens, no jump stack gets allocated and crash occurs
because no jumpstack was allocated.
