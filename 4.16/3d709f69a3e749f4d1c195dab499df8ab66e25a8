ipv6: Use hash-threshold instead of modulo-N

Now that each nexthop stores its region boundary in the multipath hash
function's output space, we can use hash-threshold instead of modulo-N
in multipath selection.

This reduces the number of checks we need to perform during lookup, as
dead and linkdown nexthops are assigned a negative region boundary. In
addition, in contrast to modulo-N, only flows near region boundaries are
affected when a nexthop is added or removed.
