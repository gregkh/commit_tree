thermal: armada: Use real status register name

Three 32-bit registers are used to drive the thermal IP: control0,
control1 and status. The two control registers share the same name both
in the documentation and in the code, while the latter is referred as
"sensor" in the code. Rename this pointer to be called "status" in order
to be aligned with the documentation.
