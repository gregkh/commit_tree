scsi: lpfc: correct sg_seg_cnt attribute min vs default

Prior patch mixed up what argument in the macro was what, so min value
was placed as the "default" argument, and the default value was placed
as the "min" argument. Thus, when the default was applied, it looked
like the default was smaller than the allowed min.

Swap argument postions to correct.
