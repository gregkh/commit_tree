media: i2c: enable i2c IR for hardware which isn't HD-PVR

This is a fix for commit 329d88da4df9 ("[media] media: i2c: Don't export
ir-kbd-i2c module alias") that stopped the module from being loaded
automagically.

The problems described only affect the HD-PVR, so it should not affect
other hardware; also if the module happens to be loaded, the i2c IR
part of the HD-PVR will be enabled anyway.
