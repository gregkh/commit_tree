mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix error path in mlxsw_sp_vr_create

Since mlxsw_sp_fib_create() and mlxsw_sp_mr_table_create()
use ERR_PTR macro to propagate int err through return of a pointer,
the return value is not NULL in case of failure. So if one
of the calls fails, one of vr->fib4, vr->fib6 or vr->mr4_table
is not NULL and mlxsw_sp_vr_is_used wrongly assumes
that vr is in use which leads to crash like following one:

[ 1293.949291] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000000000006c9
[ 1293.952729] IP: mlxsw_sp_mr_table_flush+0x15/0x70 [mlxsw_spectrum]

Fix this by using local variables to hold the pointers and set vr->*
only in case everything went fine.
