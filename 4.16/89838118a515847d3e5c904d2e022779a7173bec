RDMA/cma: Fix rdma_cm path querying for RoCE

The 'if' logic in ucma_query_path was broken with OPA was introduced
and started to treat RoCE paths as as OPA paths. Invert the logic
of the 'if' so only OPA paths are treated as OPA paths.

Otherwise the path records returned to rdma_cma users are mangled
when in RoCE mode.
