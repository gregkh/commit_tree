memremap: drop private struct page_map

'struct page_map' is a private structure of 'struct dev_pagemap' but the
latter replicates all the same fields as the former so there isn't much
value in it. Thus drop it in favour of a completely public struct.

This is a clean up in preperation for a more generally useful
'devm_memeremap_pages' interface.
