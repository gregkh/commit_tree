serial: sh-sci: prevent lockup on full TTY buffers

When the TTY buffers fill up to the configured maximum, a system lockup
occurs:

[  598.820128] INFO: rcu_preempt detected stalls on CPUs/tasks:

This can be prevented by doing a dummy read of the RX data register.

This issue affects both HSCIF and SCIF ports. Reported for R-Car H3 ES2.0;
reproduced and fixed on H3 ES1.1. Probably affects other R-Car platforms
as well.
