tools lib traceevent: Use asprintf when possible

It makes the code clearer and less error prone.

clearer:
- less code
- the code is now using the same format to create strings dynamically

less error prone:
- no magic number +2 +9 +5 to compute the size
- no copy&paste of the strings to compute the size and to concatenate

The function `asprintf` is not POSIX standard but the program
was already using it. Later it can be decided to use only POSIX
functions, then we can easly replace all the `asprintf(3)` with a local
implementation of that function.
