rcutorture: Simplify functions.sh include path

Inclusions of 'functions.sh' from 'kvm-test-1-run.sh' and
'kvm-recheck*.sh' use its absolute path.  Because the directory containing
'functions.sh' is already in PATH, the full path is unnecessary.  This
commit therefore simplifies the inclusions to use the short relative path.
