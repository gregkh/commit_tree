microblaze: Setup dependencies for ASM optimized lib functions

The patch:
"microblaze: Setup proper dependency for optimized lib functions"
(sha1: 7b6ce52be3f86520524711a6f33f3866f9339694)
didn't setup all dependencies properly.
Optimized lib functions in C are also present for little endian
and optimized library functions in assembler are implemented only for
big endian version.
