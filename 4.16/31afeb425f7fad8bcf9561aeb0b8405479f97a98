ipv6: change route cache aging logic

In current route cache aging logic, if a route has both RTF_EXPIRE and
RTF_GATEWAY set, the route will only be removed if the neighbor cache
has no NTF_ROUTER flag. Otherwise, even if the route has expired, it
won't get deleted.
Fix this logic to always check if the route has expired first and then
do the gateway neighbor cache check if previous check decide to not
remove the exception entry.
