spi: a3700: Remove endianness swapping functions when accessing FIFOs

Fixes the following sparse warnings :
line 504: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
line 504:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [usertype] val
line 504:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>
line 527: warning: cast to restricted __le32

This is solved by removing endian-converson functions, since the
converted values are going through readl/writel anyway, which take care
of the conversion.
