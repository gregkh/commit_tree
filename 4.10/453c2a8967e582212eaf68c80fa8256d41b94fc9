dm raid: correct error messages on old metadata validation

When target 1.9.1 gets takeover/reshape requests on devices with old superblock
format not supporting such conversions and rejects them in super_init_validation(),
it logs bogus error message (e.g. Reshape when a takeover is requested).

Whilst on it, add messages for disk adding/removing and stripe sectors
reshape requests, use the newer rs_{takeover,reshape}_requested() API,
address a raid10 false positive in checking array positions and
remove rs_set_new() because device members are already set proper.
