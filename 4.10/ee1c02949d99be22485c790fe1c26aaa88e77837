[media] media: ti-vpe: vpdma: Add RAW8 and RAW16 data types

Add RAW8 and RAW16 data type to VPDMA.
To handle RAW format we are re-using the YUV CBY422
vpdma data type so that we use the vpdma to re-order
the incoming bytes, as the VIP parser assumes that the
first byte presented on the bus is the MSB of a 2
bytes value.

RAW8 handles from 1 to 8 bits.
RAW16 handles from 9 to 16 bits.
