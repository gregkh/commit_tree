scsi: lpfc: Correct panics with eh_timeout and eh_deadline

Correct panics with eh_timeout and eh_deadline

We were having double completions on our SLI-3 version of adapters.
Solved by clearing our command pointer before calling scsi_done.

The eh paths potentially ran simulatenously and would see the non-null
value and invoke scsi_done again.
