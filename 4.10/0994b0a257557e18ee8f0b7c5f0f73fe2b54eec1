usb: gadgetfs: restrict upper bound on device configuration size

Andrey Konovalov reported that we were not properly checking the upper
limit before of a device configuration size before calling
memdup_user(), which could cause some problems.

So set the upper limit to PAGE_SIZE * 4, which should be good enough for
all devices.
