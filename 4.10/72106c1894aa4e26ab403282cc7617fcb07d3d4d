watchdog: da9062/61: watchdog driver

The of_device_id match array is added to support "dlg,da9062-watchdog"
as a valid .compatible string. A MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro is added.

This patch assumes the use of a DA9062 fallback compatible string for the
DTS to pick up the DA9062 device driver for use with the DA9061 watchdog
hardware

Copyright header is updated to add DA9061 in its description and the module
description macro is extended to include DA9061.

Kconfig is updated to reflect support for DA9061/62.
