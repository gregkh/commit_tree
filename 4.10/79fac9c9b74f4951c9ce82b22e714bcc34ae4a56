scsi: ibmvscsis: Rearrange functions for future patches

This patch reorders functions in a manner necessary for a follow-on
patch.  It also makes some minor styling changes (mostly removing extra
spaces) and fixes some typos.

There are no code changes in this patch, with one exception: due to the
reordering of the functions, I needed to explicitly declare a function
at the top of the file.  However, this will be removed in the next patch,
since the code requiring the predeclaration will be removed.
