batman-adv: Less function calls in batadv_is_ap_isolated() after error detection

The variables "tt_local_entry" and "tt_global_entry" were eventually
checked again despite of a corresponding null pointer test before.

* Avoid this double check by reordering a function call sequence
  and the better selection of jump targets.

* Omit the initialisation for these variables at the beginning then.
