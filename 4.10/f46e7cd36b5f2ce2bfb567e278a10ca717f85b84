scsi: advansys: fix build warning for PCI=n

The advansys probe function tries to handle both ISA and PCI cases, each
hidden in an #ifdef when unused. This leads to a warning indicating that
when PCI is disabled we could be using uninitialized data:

drivers/scsi/advansys.c: In function  advansys_board_found :
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:11036:5: error:  ret  may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:10928:28: note:  ret  was declared here
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:11309:8: error:  share_irq  may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:10928:6: note:  share_irq  was declared here

This cannot happen in practice because the hardware in question only
exists for PCI, but changing the code to just error out here is better
for consistency and avoids the warning.
