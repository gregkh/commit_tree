drm/i915: Reuse the active golden render state batch

The golden render state is constant, but we recreate the batch setting
it up for every new context. If we keep that batch in a volatile cache
we can safely reuse it whenever we need to initialise a new context. We
mark the pages as purgeable and use the shrinker to recover pages from
the batch whenever we face memory pressues, recreating that batch afresh
on the next new context.
