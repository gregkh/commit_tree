drm/i915: Reset the breadcrumbs IRQ more carefully

Along with the interrupt, we want to restore the fake-irq and
wait-timeout detection. If we use the breadcrumbs interface to setup the
interrupt as it wants, the auxiliary timers will also be restored.

v2: Cancel both timers as well, sanitize the IMR.
