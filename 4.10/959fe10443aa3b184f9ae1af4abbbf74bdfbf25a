[media] gspca-cardlist.rst: sort entries and adjust table margins

Some entries are out of order.

While here, clear spaces/tabs.

The content remains the same, with the exeption of one duplicated
entry from the same driver, where two different brand names share
the same entry. The content of such cell was merged, using a
comma.
