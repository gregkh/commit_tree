PCI: hv: Delete the device earlier from hbus->children for hot-remove

After we send a PCI_EJECTION_COMPLETE message to the host, the host will
immediately send us a PCI_BUS_RELATIONS message with
relations->device_count == 0, so pci_devices_present_work(), running on
another thread, can find the being-ejected device, mark the
hpdev->reported_missing to true, and run list_move_tail()/list_del() for
the device -- this races hv_eject_device_work() -> list_del().

Move the list_del() in hv_eject_device_work() to an earlier place, i.e.,
before we send PCI_EJECTION_COMPLETE, so later the
pci_devices_present_work() can't see the device.
