spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Fix incorrect DMA setup

Currently dmaengine_prep_slave_single was being called with length
set to the complete DMA buffer size. This resulted in unwanted bytes
being transferred to the SPI register leading to clock and MOSI lines
having unwanted data even after chip select got deasserted and the
required bytes having been transferred.

While at it also clean up the use of curr_xfer_len which is central
to the DMA setup, from bytes to DMA transfers for every use.
