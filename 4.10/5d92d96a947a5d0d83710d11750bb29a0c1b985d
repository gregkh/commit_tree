perf sched timehist: Handle zero sample->tid properly

Sometimes samples have tid of 0 but non-0 pid.  It ends up having a new
thread of 0 tid/pid (instead of referring idle task) since tid is used
to search matching task.  But I guess it's wrong to use 0 as a tid when
pid is set.  This patch uses tid only if it has a non-zero value or same
as pid (of 0).
