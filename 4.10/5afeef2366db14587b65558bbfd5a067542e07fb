USB: serial: oti6858: fix NULL-deref at open

Fix NULL-pointer dereference in open() should the device lack the
expected endpoints:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000030
...
PC is at oti6858_open+0x30/0x1d0 [oti6858]

Note that a missing interrupt-in endpoint would have caused open() to
fail.

cable)")
