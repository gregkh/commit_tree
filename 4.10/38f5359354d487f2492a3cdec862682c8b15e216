drm/nouveau/pci: set streaming DMA mask early

Some subdevices (i.e., fb/nv50.c and fb/gf100.c) map a scratch page using
dma_map_page() way before the TTM layer has had a chance to set the DMA
mask. This may prevent the driver from loading at all on platforms whose
system memory is not covered by the default DMA mask of 32-bit (i.e., when
all RAM is above 4 GB).

So set a preliminary DMA mask right after constructing the PCI device, and
base it on the .dma_bits member of the MMU subdevice, which is what the TTM
layer will base the DMA mask on as well.
