staging: fsl-mc: uprev binary interface to match MC v10.x

DPAA2 will not support MC firmware versions prior to MC v10.x.
Update the MC interface code and drivers to reflect this.
   -update the object .h files and code that builds commands to include
    the new command version in the command header
   -object versions are no longer available in the object attributes,
    so remove references to them and instead get the version from the
    new get_api_version() command
   -create/destroy commands for all objects have new arguments
   -dpmng_get_container_id() is replaced by dprc_get_container_id()

This supports a hardware ABI change and thus to match the new ABI
all the above changes need to happen in a single patch.

All MC firmware versions >= 10 will be supported going forward.
