mm: get rid of __GFP_OTHER_NODE

The flag was introduced by commit 78afd5612deb ("mm: add
__GFP_OTHER_NODE flag") to allow proper accounting of remote node
allocations done by kernel daemons on behalf of a process - e.g.
khugepaged.

After "mm: fix remote numa hits statistics" we do not need and actually
use the flag so we can safely remove it because all allocations which
are satisfied from their "home" node are accounted properly.
