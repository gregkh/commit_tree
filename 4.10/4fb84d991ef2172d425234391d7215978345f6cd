drm/i915: Remove unused "valid" parameter from pte_encode

We never used any invalid ptes, those were put in place for
a possibility of doing gpu faults. However our batchbuffers are not
restricted in length, so everything needs to be pointing to something
and thus out-of-bounds is pointing to scratch.

Remove the valid flag as it is always true.

v2: Expand commit msg, patch reorder (Mika)
