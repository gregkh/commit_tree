staging: dgnc: Fix lines longer than 80 characters

For two cases (beginning and end of the patch) I opted to create small
functions instead of breaking the the lines in a weird way.

The other changes are simple ones: either by breaking the line when
appropriate or by turning a comment into a multi-line one.
