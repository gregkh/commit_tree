s390: provide memmove implementation

Provide an s390 specific memmove implementation which is faster than
the generic implementation which copies byte-wise.

For non-destructive (as defined by the mvc instruction) memmove
operations the following table compares the old default implementation
versus the new s390 specific implementation:

size     old   new
   1     1ns   8ns
   2     2ns   8ns
   4     4ns   8ns
   8     7ns   8ns
  16    17ns   8ns
  32    35ns   8ns
  64    65ns   9ns
 128   146ns  10ns
 256   298ns  11ns
 512   537ns  11ns
1024  1193ns  19ns
2048  2405ns  36ns

So only for very small sizes the old implementation is faster. For
overlapping memmoves, where the mvc instruction can't be used, the new
implementation is as slow as the old one.
