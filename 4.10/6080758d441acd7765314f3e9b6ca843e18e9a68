dm ioctl: use offsetof() instead of open-coding it

Subtracting sizes is a fragile approach because the result is only
correct if the compiler has not added any padding at the end of the
structure. Hence use offsetof() instead of size subtraction. An
additional advantage of offsetof() is that it makes the intent more
clear.
