drm/i915/execlists: Move clearing submission count from reset to init

After a GPU reset, we want to replay our queue of requests. However, the
GPU reset clobbered the state and we only fixup the state for the guilty
request - and engines deemed innocent we try to leave untouched so that
we recover as completely as possible. However, we need to clear the sw
tracking of the ELSP ports even for innocent requests, so move the clear
to the common path of init_hw (from reset_hw).
