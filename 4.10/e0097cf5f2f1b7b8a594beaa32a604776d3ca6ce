mmc: queue: Fix queue thread wake-up

The only time the driver sleeps expecting to be woken upon the arrival of
a new request, is when the dispatch queue is empty. The only time that it
is known whether the dispatch queue is empty is after NULL is returned
from blk_fetch_request() while under the queue lock.

Recognizing those facts, simplify the synchronization between the queue
thread and the request function. A couple of flags tell the request
function what to do, and the queue lock and barriers associated with
wake-ups ensure synchronization.

The result is simpler and allows the removal of the context_info lock.
