tcp: make undo_cwnd mandatory for congestion modules

The undo_cwnd fallback in the stack doubles cwnd based on ssthresh,
which un-does reno halving behaviour.

It seems more appropriate to let congctl algorithms pair .ssthresh
and .undo_cwnd properly. Add a 'tcp_reno_undo_cwnd' function and wire it
up for all congestion algorithms that used to rely on the fallback.
