perf diff: Fix -o/--order option behavior (again)

Commit 21e6d8428664 ("perf diff: Use perf_hpp__register_sort_field
interface") changed list_add() to perf_hpp__register_sort_field().

This resulted in a behavior change since the field was added to the tail
instead of the head.  So the -o option is mostly ignored due to its
order in the list.

This patch fixes it by adding perf_hpp__prepend_sort_field().
