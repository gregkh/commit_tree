powerpc/powernv: Don't warn on PE init if unfreeze is unsupported

Whenever a PE is initialised in powernv, opal_pci_eeh_freeze_clear() is
called.  This is to remove any existing freeze, and has no negative side
effects if the PE is already in an unfrozen state.  On PHB backends that
don't support this operation and return OPAL_UNSUPPORTED, this creates a
scary and misleading warning message.

Skip the warning message on init if OPAL_UNSUPPORTED is returned.

As far as I'm aware, this currently only affects NPUs.
