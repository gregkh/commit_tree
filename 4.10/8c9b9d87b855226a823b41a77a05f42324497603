x86/tsc: Limit the adjust value further

Adjust value 0x80000000 and other values larger than that render the TSC
deadline timer disfunctional.

We have not yet any information about this from Intel, but experimentation
clearly proves that this is a 32/64 bit and sign extension issue.

If adjust values larger than that are actually required, which might be the
case for physical CPU hotplug, then we need to disable the deadline timer
on the affected package/CPUs and use the local APIC timer instead.

That requires some surgery in the APIC setup code, so we just limit the
ADJUST register value into the known to work range for now and revisit this
when Intel comes forth with proper information.
