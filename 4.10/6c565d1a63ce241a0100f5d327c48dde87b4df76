ARM: dts: omap4: Add an empty chosen node to top level DTSI

Commit da6269e7e3dd ("ARM: dts: omap4: Remove skeleton.dtsi usage")
removed the skeleton.dtsi usage since we want to get rid of it.

But this can cause issues when booting a kernel with a boot-loader
that doesn't create a chosen node if this isn't present in the DTB
since the decompressor relies on a pre-existing chosen node to be
available to insert the command line and merge other ATAGS info.
