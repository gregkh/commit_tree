brd: remove support for BLKFLSBUF

Discontinue having the brd driver destructively free all pages in the
ramdisk in response to the BLKFLSBUF ioctl.  Doing so allows a BLKFLSBUF
ioctl issued to a logical partition to destroy pages of the parent brd
device (and all other partitions of that brd device).

This change breaks compatibility - but in this case the compatibility
breaks more than it helps.
