perf record: Force ignore_missing_thread for uid option

Enable perf_evsel::ignore_missing_thread for -u option to ignore
complete failure if any of the user's processes die between its
enumeration and time we open the event.

Committer notes:

While doing a 'make -j4 allmodconfig' we sometimes get into the race:

Before:

  # perf record -u acme
  Error:
  The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 3 (No such process) for event (cycles:ppp).
  /bin/dmesg may provide additional information.
  No CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y kernel support configured?
  #

After:

  [root@jouet ~]# perf record -u acme
  WARNING: Ignored open failure for pid 9888
  WARNING: Ignored open failure for pid 18059
  [root@jouet ~]#

Which is an improvement, with the races not preventing the remaining threads
for the specified user from being monitored, but the message probably needs
further clarification.
