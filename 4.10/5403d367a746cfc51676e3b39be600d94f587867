rcu: Remove obsolete rcu_check_callbacks() header comment

In the deep past, rcu_check_callbacks() was only invoked if rcu_pending()
returned true.  Which was fine, but these days rcu_check_callbacks()
is invoked unconditionally.  This commit therefore removes the obsolete
sentence from the header comment.
