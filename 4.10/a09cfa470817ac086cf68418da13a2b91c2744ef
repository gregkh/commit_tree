audit: don't ever sleep on a command record/message

Sleeping on a command record/message in audit_log_start() could slow
something, e.g. auditd, from doing something important, e.g. clean
shutdown, which could present problems on a heavily loaded system.
This patch allows tasks to bypass any queue restrictions if they are
logging a command record/message.
