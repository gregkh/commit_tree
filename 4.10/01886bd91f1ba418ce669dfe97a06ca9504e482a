netfilter: remove hook_entries field from nf_hook_state

This field is only useful for nf_queue, so store it in the
nf_queue_entry structure instead, away from the core path. Pass
hook_head to nf_hook_slow().

Since we always have a valid entry on the first iteration in
nf_iterate(), we can use 'do { ... } while (entry)' loop instead.
