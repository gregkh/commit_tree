ixgbe: ixgbe_atr() compute l4_proto only if non-paged data has network/transport headers

For some Tx paths (e.g., tpacket_snd()), ixgbe_atr may be
passed down an sk_buff that has the network and transport
header in the paged data, so it needs to make sure these
headers are available in the headlen bytes to calculate the
l4_proto.

This patch expect that network and transport headers are
already available in the non-paged header dat.  The assumption
is that the caller has set this up if l4_proto based Tx
steering is desired.
