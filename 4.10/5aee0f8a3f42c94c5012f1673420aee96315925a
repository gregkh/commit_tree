ext4: fix in-superblock mount options processing

Fix a large number of problems with how we handle mount options in the
superblock.  For one, if the string in the superblock is long enough
that it is not null terminated, we could run off the end of the string
and try to interpret superblocks fields as characters.  It's unlikely
this will cause a security problem, but it could result in an invalid
parse.  Also, parse_options is destructive to the string, so in some
cases if there is a comma-separated string, it would be modified in
the superblock.  (Fortunately it only happens on file systems with a
1k block size.)
