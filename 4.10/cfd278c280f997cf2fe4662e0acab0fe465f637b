NFSv4.1: nfs4_fl_prepare_ds must be careful about reporting success.

Various places assume that if nfs4_fl_prepare_ds() turns a non-NULL 'ds',
then ds->ds_clp will also be non-NULL.

This is not necessasrily true in the case when the process received a fatal signal
while nfs4_pnfs_ds_connect is waiting in nfs4_wait_ds_connect().
In that case ->ds_clp may not be set, and the devid may not recently have been marked
unavailable.

So add a test for ds_clp == NULL and return NULL in that case.
