IB/hfi1: Disable header suppression for short packets

For the received packets with payload less or equal 8DWS
RxDmaDataFifoRdUncErr is not reported. There is set RHF.EccErr
if the header is not suppressed. When such packet is detected
on the send side the header suppression mechanism is disabled
by clearing SH bit in the packet header.
