packet: fix races in fanout_add()

Multiple threads can call fanout_add() at the same time.

We need to grab fanout_mutex earlier to avoid races that could
lead to one thread freeing po->rollover that was set by another thread.

Do the same in fanout_release(), for peace of mind, and to help us
finding lockdep issues earlier.

Fixes: 0648ab70afe6 ("packet: rollover prepare: per-socket state")
