serial: ioc4_serial: Free memory when kzalloc fails during probe

Inside ioc4_attach_local() 4 memory was allocated using kzalloc and
assign it to ports[] within loop. When kzalloc fails inside loop,
it returns error without freeing previously allocated memory and we
may have memory leak. Fix this by freeing ports[] before return.
