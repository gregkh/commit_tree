openvswitch: use hard_header_len instead of hardcoded ETH_HLEN

On tx, use hard_header_len while deciding whether to refragment or drop the
packet. That way, all combinations are calculated correctly:

* L2 packet going to L2 interface (the L2 header len is subtracted),
* L2 packet going to L3 interface (the L2 header is included in the packet
  lenght),
* L3 packet going to L3 interface.
