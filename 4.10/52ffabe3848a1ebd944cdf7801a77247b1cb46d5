tracing: Make __buffer_unlock_commit() always_inline

The function __buffer_unlock_commit() is called in a few places outside of
trace.c. But for the most part, it should really be inlined, as it is in the
hot path of the trace_events. For the callers outside of trace.c, create a
new function trace_buffer_unlock_commit_nostack(), as the reason it was used
was to avoid the stack tracing that trace_buffer_unlock_commit() could do.
