s390/dasd: Make use of dasd_set_feature() more often

When setting certain attributes, we actually set the according feature
flag. Do this by using dasd_set_feature() at a few occurrences and
remove duplicate code.

In dasd_set_feature() dasd_find_busid() is used to retrieve the devmap
for the device in question. Combined with the change above, this would
require the device to be set online at least once so that a devmap is
being created. Change that by using dasd_devmap_from_cdev() instead,
which uses dasd_find_busid() first and will create a devmap accordingly
if there is none yet.
