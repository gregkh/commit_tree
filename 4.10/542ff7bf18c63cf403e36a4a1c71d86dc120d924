block: new direct I/O implementation

Similar to the simple fast path, but we now need a dio structure to
track multiple-bio completions.  It's basically a cut-down version
of the new iomap-based direct I/O code for filesystems, but without
all the logic to call into the filesystem for extent lookup or
allocation, and without the complex I/O completion workqueue handler
for AIO - instead we just use the FUA bit on the bios to ensure
data is flushed to stable storage.
