target/iscsi: Fix double free in lio_target_tiqn_addtpg()

This iscsit_tpg_add_portal_group() function is only called from
lio_target_tiqn_addtpg().  Both functions free the "tpg" pointer on
error so it's a double free bug.  The memory is allocated in the caller
so it should be freed in the caller and not here.
