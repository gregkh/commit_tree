led: core: Fix blink_brightness setting race

All 3 of led_timer_func, led_set_brightness and led_set_software_blink
set blink_brightness. If led_timer_func or led_set_software_blink race
with led_set_brightness they may end up overwriting the new
blink_brightness. The new atomic work_flags does not protect against
this as it just protects the flags and not blink_brightness.

This commit introduces a new new_blink_brightness value which gets
set by led_set_brightness and read by led_timer_func on LED on, fixing
this.

Dealing with the new brightness at LED on time, makes the new
brightness apply sooner, which also fixes a led_set_brightness which
happens while a oneshot blink which ends in LED on is running not
getting applied.
