stm class: ftrace: Add ftrace-export-over-stm driver

This patch adds a driver that models itself as an stm_source called
stm_ftrace. Once the stm device and stm_ftrace have been linked via
sysfs, the driver registers itself as a trace_export and everything
passed to the interface from Ftrace subsystem will end up in the STM
trace engine.
