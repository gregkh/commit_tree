arm64: Disable PAN on uaccess_enable()

Commit 4b65a5db3627 ("arm64: Introduce uaccess_{disable,enable}
functionality based on TTBR0_EL1") added conditional user access
enable/disable. Unfortunately, a typo prevents the PAN bit from being
cleared for user access functions.

Restore the PAN functionality by adding the missing '!'.
