ARM: clk: imx31: properly init clocks for machines with DT

Clock initialization for i.MX31 powered machines with DT support
should be done by a call of an init function registered with
CLK_OF_DECLARE() in common clock framework.

The change converts exported mx31_clocks_init_dt() into a static
initialization function registered by CLK_OF_DECLARE().
