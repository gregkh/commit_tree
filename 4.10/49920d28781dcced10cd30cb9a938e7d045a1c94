mm: make transparent hugepage size public

Test programs want to know the size of a transparent hugepage.  While it
is commonly the same as the size of a hugetlbfs page (shown as
Hugepagesize in /proc/meminfo), that is not always so: powerpc
implements transparent hugepages in a different way from hugetlbfs
pages, so it's coincidence when their sizes are the same; and x86 and
others can support more than one hugetlbfs page size.

Add /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/hpage_pmd_size to show the THP
size in bytes - it's the same for Anonymous and Shmem hugepages.  Call
it hpage_pmd_size (after HPAGE_PMD_SIZE) rather than hpage_size, in case
some transparent support for pud and pgd pages is added later.
