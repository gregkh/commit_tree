scsi: bfa: fix wrongly initialized variable in bfad_im_bsg_els_ct_request()

Commit 01e0e15c8b3b ("scsi: don't use fc_bsg_job::request and
fc_bsg_job::reply directly") introduced a typo, which causes that the
bsg_request variable in bfad_im_bsg_els_ct_request() is initialized to
itself instead of pointing to the bsg job's request.
