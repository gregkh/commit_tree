staging: iio: tsl2583: remove unnecessary chip status checks in suspend/resume

The device probing and the suspend/resume code checks a flag internal to
the driver that determines whether or not the chip is in a working
state. These checks are not needed. This patch removes the unnecessary
checks. It will do no harm to the hardware if the chip is
reinitialized if it is already powered on.
