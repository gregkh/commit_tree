clk: imx6: Make the LDB_DI0 and LDB_DI1 clocks read-only

Due to incorrect placement of the clock gate cell in the ldb_di[x]_clk
tree, the glitchy parent mux of ldb_di[x]_clk can cause a glitch to
enter the ldb_di_ipu_div divider. If the divider gets locked up, no
ldb_di[x]_clk is generated, and the LVDS display will hang when the
ipu_di_clk is sourced from ldb_di_clk.

To fix the problem, both the new and current parent of the ldb_di_clk
should be disabled before the switch. As this can not be guaranteed by
the clock framework during runtime, make the ldb_di[x]_sel muxes read-only.
A workaround to set the muxes once during boot could be added to the
kernel or bootloader.
