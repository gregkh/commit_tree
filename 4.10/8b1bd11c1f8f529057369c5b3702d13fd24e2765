pinctrl: samsung: Add the support the multiple IORESOURCE_MEM for one pin-bank

This patch supports the multiple IORESOURCE_MEM resources for one pin-bank.
In the pre-existing Exynos series, the registers of the gpio bank are included
in the one memory map. But, some gpio bank need to support the one more memory
map (IORESOURCE_MEM) because the registers of gpio bank are separated into
the different memory map.

For example,
The both ALIVE and IMEM domain have the different memory base address.
The GFP[1-5] of exynos5433 are composed as following:
- ALIVE domain : WEINT_* registers
- IMEM domain  : CON/DAT/PUD/DRV/CONPDN/PUDPDN register
