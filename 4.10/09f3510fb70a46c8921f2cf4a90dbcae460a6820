ARM: BCM5301X: Add back handler ignoring external imprecise aborts

Since early BCM5301X days we got abort handler that was removed by
commit 937b12306ea79 ("ARM: BCM5301X: remove workaround imprecise abort
fault handler"). It assumed we need to deal only with pending aborts
left by the bootloader. Unfortunately this isn't true for BCM5301X.

When probing PCI config space (device enumeration) it is expected to
have master aborts on the PCI bus. Most bridges don't forward (or they
allow disabling it) these errors onto the AXI/AMBA bus but not the
Northstar (BCM5301X) one.

iProc PCIe controller on Northstar seems to be some older one, without
a control register for errors forwarding. It means we need to workaround
this at platform level. All newer platforms are not affected by this
issue.
