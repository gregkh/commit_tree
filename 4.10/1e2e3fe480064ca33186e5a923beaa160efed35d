ALSA: usb-audio: avoid setting of sample rate multiple times on bus

Some of userland applications call 'snd_pcm_hw_params()' and
'snd_pcm_hw_prepare()' sequentially, which means 'snd_pcm_hw_prepare()'
is called twice and the second 'snd_pcm_hw_prepare()' is called in
'SNDRV_PCM_STATE_PREPARED' state.

Some devices are not able to manage this and they will stop playback
if the sample rate will be configured several times over USB protocol.
