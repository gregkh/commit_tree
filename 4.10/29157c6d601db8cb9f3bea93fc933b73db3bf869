iio: dac: mcp4725: support voltage reference selection

MCP47x6 chip supports selection of a voltage reference (VDD, VREF buffered
or unbuffered). MCP4725 doesn't have this feature thus the eventual setting
is ignored and user is warned.

The setting is stored only in the volatile memory of the chip. You need to
manually store it to the EEPROM of the chip via 'store_eeprom' sysfs entry.
