gcc-plugins: Adjust Kconfig to avoid cyc_complexity

In preparation for removing "depends on !COMPILE_TEST" from GCC_PLUGINS,
the GCC_PLUGIN_CYC_COMPLEXITY plugin needs to gain the restriction,
since it is mainly an example, and produces (intended) voluminous stderr
reporting, which is generally undesirable for allyesconfig-style build
tests. This additionally puts the plugin behind EXPERT and improves the
help text.
