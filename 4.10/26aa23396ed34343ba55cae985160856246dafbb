Revert "Skip intel_crt_init for Dell XPS 8700"

This reverts commit 10b6ee4a87811a110cb01eaca01eb04da6801baf.

According to [1] Dell XPS8700 VBT says 'int_crt_support 0', so thanks
to commit e4abb733bb72 ("drm/i915: Check VBT for CRT port presence on
HSW/BDW") we no longer need to blacklist it based on DMI.

Looking through the bug report, SFUSE_STRAP based detection was
apparently also tried and failed, but the VBT based one should still
work just fine.

The commit says that the symptom was a frozen machine, but based on the
bug report it doesn't look like the CRT detection was at least directly
responsible for such a drastic outcome.
