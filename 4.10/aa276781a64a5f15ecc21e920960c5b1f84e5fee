firmware: Add basic support for TI System Control Interface (TI-SCI) protocol

Texas Instrument's System Control Interface (TI-SCI) Message Protocol
is used in Texas Instrument's System on Chip (SoC) such as those
in keystone family K2G SoC to communicate between various compute
processors with a central system controller entity.

TI-SCI message protocol provides support for management of various
hardware entities within the SoC. Add support driver to allow
communication with system controller entity within the SoC using the
mailbox client.

We introduce the basic registration and query capability for the
driver protocol as part of this change. Subsequent patches add in
functionality specific to the TI-SCI features.
