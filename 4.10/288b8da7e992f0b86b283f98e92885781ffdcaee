ASoC: topology: Support topology file of ABI v4

Users start to use topology ABI from v4. ABI v5 updated existing manifest
and PCM elements. Two previous patches can support these ABI updates in a
backward compatible way. So if the topology file from user space is
generated by ABI v4, kernel will no longer quit but continue parsing.
