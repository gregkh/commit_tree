ARM: OMAP5: Fix mpuss_early_init

We need to properly initialize mpuss also on omap5 like we do on omap4.
Otherwise we run into similar kexec problems like we had on omap4 when
trying to kexec from a kernel with PM initialized.

Fixes: 0573b957fc21 ("ARM: OMAP4+: Prevent CPU1 related hang with kexec")
