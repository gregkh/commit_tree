s390/vmlogrdr: fix IUCV buffer allocation

The buffer for iucv_message_receive() needs to be below 2 GB. In
__iucv_message_receive(), the buffer address is casted to an u32, which
would result in either memory corruption or an addressing exception when
using addresses >= 2 GB.

Fix this by using GFP_DMA for the buffer allocation.
