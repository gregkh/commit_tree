xfs: Move AGI buffer type setting to xfs_read_agi

We've missed properly setting the buffer type for
an AGI transaction in 3 spots now, so just move it
into xfs_read_agi() and set it if we are in a transaction
to avoid the problem in the future.

This is similar to how it is done in i.e. the dir3
and attr3 read functions.
