netfilter: nf_tables: add stateful objects

This patch augments nf_tables to support stateful objects. This new
infrastructure allows you to create, dump and delete stateful objects,
that are identified by a user-defined name.

This patch adds the generic infrastructure, follow up patches add
support for two stateful objects: counters and quotas.

This patch provides a native infrastructure for nf_tables to replace
nfacct, the extended accounting infrastructure for iptables.
