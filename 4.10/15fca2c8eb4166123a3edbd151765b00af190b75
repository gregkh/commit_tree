net/mlx4_en: Add ethtool statistics for XDP cases

XDP statistics are reported in ethtool, in total and per ring,
as follows:
- xdp_drop: the number of packets dropped by xdp.
- xdp_tx: the number of packets forwarded by xdp.
- xdp_tx_full: the number of times an xdp forward failed
	due to a full tx xdp ring.

In addition, all packets that are dropped/forwarded by XDP
are no longer accounted in rx_packets/rx_bytes of the ring,
so that they count traffic that is passed to the stack.
