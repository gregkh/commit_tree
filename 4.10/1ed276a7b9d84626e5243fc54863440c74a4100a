PCI: Autosense device removal in pci_bridge_d3_update()

The algorithm to update the flag indicating whether a bridge may go to D3
makes a few optimizations based on whether the update was caused by the
removal of a device on the one hand, versus the addition of a device or the
change of its D3cold flags on the other hand.

The information whether the update pertains to a removal is currently
passed in by the caller, but the function may as well determine that itself
by examining the device in question, thereby allowing for a considerable
simplification and reduction of the code.

Out of several options to determine removal, I've chosen the function
device_is_registered() because it's cheap:  It merely returns the
dev->kobj.state_in_sysfs flag.  That flag is set through device_add() when
the root bus is scanned and cleared through device_remove().  The call to
pci_bridge_d3_update() happens after each of these calls, respectively, so
the ordering is correct.

No functional change intended.
