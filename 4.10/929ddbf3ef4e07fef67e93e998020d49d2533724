ring-buffer: Always inline rb_event_data()

The rb_event_data() is the fast path of getting the ring buffer data from an
event. Externally, ring_buffer_event_data() is used to access this function.
But unfortunately, rb_event_data() is not inlined, and calling
ring_buffer_event_data() causes that function to be called again. Force
rb_event_data() to be inlined to lower the number of operations needed when
calling ring_buffer_event_data().
