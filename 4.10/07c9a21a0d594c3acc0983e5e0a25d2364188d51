drm/i915: Export a function to flush the context upon pinning

For legacy contexts we employ an optimisation to only flush the context
when binding into the global GTT. This avoids stalling on the GPU when
reloading an active context. Wrap this detail up into a helper and
export it for a potential third user. (Longer term, context pinning
needs to be reworked as the current handling of switch context pins too
late and so risks eviction and corrupting the request. Plans, plans,
plans.)

v2: Expand the comment explaining the optimisation for avoiding the
stall on active contexts.
