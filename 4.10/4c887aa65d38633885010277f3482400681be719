tipc: ignore requests when the connection state is not CONNECTED

In tipc_conn_sendmsg(), we first queue the request to the outqueue
followed by the connection state check. If the connection is not
connected, we should not queue this message.

In this commit, we reject the messages if the connection state is
not CF_CONNECTED.
