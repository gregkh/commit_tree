net: thunderx: acpi: fix LMAC initialization

While probing BGX we requesting appropriate QLM for it's configuration
and get LMAC count by that request. Then, while reading configured
MAC values from SSDT table we need to save them in proper mapping:
  BGX[i]->lmac[j].mac = <MAC value>
to later provide for initialization stuff. In order to fill
such mapping properly we need to add lmac index to be used while
acpi initialization since at this moment bgx->lmac_count already contains
actual value.
