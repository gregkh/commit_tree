radix tree test suite: cache recently freed objects

The kmem_cache_alloc implementation simply allocates new memory from
malloc() and calls the ctor, which zeroes out the entire object.  This
means it cannot spot bugs where the object isn't properly reinitialised
before being freed.

Add a small (11 objects) cache before freeing objects back to malloc.
This is enough to let us write a test to catch it, although the memory
allocator is now aware of the structure of the radix tree node, since it
chains free objects through ->private_data (like the percpu cache does).
