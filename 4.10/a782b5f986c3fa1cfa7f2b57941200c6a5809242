PCI: designware: Check for iATU unroll only on platforms that use ATU

Previously we checked for iATU unroll support by reading PCIE_ATU_VIEWPORT
even on platforms, e.g., Keystone, that do not have ATU ports.  This can
cause bad behavior such as asynchronous external aborts:

  OF: PCI:   MEM 0x60000000..0x6fffffff -> 0x60000000
  Unhandled fault: asynchronous external abort (0x1211) at 0x00000000
  pgd = c0003000
  [00000000] *pgd=80000800004003, *pmd=00000000
  Internal error: : 1211 [#1] PREEMPT SMP ARM
  Modules linked in:
  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.9.0-00009-g6ff59d2-dirty #7

  PC is at dw_pcie_setup_rc+0x24/0x380
  LR is at ks_pcie_host_init+0x10/0x170

Move the dw_pcie_iatu_unroll_enabled() check so we only call it on
platforms that do not use the ATU.  These platforms supply their own
->rd_other_conf() and ->wr_other_conf() methods.
