ASoC: sun4i-codec: Move data structures to add create_card call to quirks

The audio codec on later Allwinner SoCs have a different layout and
audio path compared to the A10/A20. However the PCM parts are still
the same.

The different layout and audio paths mean we need a different
create_card function for different families, so they can create
DAPM endpoint widgets and routes.

This patch moves the regmap configs, quirks and of_device_id
structures to just before the probe function, so we can, among other
things, include a pointer for the create_card function. None of the
lines of code were changed.
