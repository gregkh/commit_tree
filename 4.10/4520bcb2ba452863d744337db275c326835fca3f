bug: Avoid Kconfig warning for BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION

The CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST option is normally meant for kernel developers
rather than production machines and is guarded by CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL.

In contrast, the newly added CONFIG_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION is meant
for security hardening and may be used on systems that intentionally
do not enable CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL. In this configuration, we get
a warning from Kconfig about the mismatched dependencies:

warning: (BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION) selects DEBUG_LIST which has unmet direct dependencies (DEBUG_KERNEL)

This annotates the DEBUG_LIST option to be selectable by
BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION when DEBUG_KERNEL is disabled.
