block: zoned: fix harmless maybe-uninitialized warning

The blkdev_report_zones produces a harmless warning when
-Wmaybe-uninitialized is set, after gcc gets a little confused
about the multiple 'goto' here:

block/blk-zoned.c: In function 'blkdev_report_zones':
block/blk-zoned.c:188:13: error: 'nz' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Moving the assignment to nr_zones makes this a little simpler
while also avoiding the warning reliably. I'm removing the
extraneous initialization of 'int ret' in the same patch, as
that is semi-related and could cause an uninitialized use of
that variable to not produce a warning.
