drm: Print some debug/error info during DP dual mode detect

There's at least one LSPCON device that occasionally returns an unexpected
adaptor ID which leads to a failed detect. Print some debug info to help
debugging this and future cases. Also print an error for an unexpected
adaptor ID, so users can report it.

v2:
- s/adapter/adaptor/ and add code comment about incorrect type 1 adaptor
  IDs. (Ville)
