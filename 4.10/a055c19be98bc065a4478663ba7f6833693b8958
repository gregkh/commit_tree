bpf, mlx5: drop priv->xdp_prog reference on netdev cleanup

mlx5e_xdp_set() is currently the only place where we drop reference on the
prog sitting in priv->xdp_prog when it's exchanged by a new one. We also
need to make sure that we eventually release that reference, for example,
in case the netdev is dismantled, otherwise we leak the program.
