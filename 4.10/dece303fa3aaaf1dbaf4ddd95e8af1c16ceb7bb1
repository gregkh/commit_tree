net: xgene: move xgene_cle_ptree_ewdn data off stack

The array for initializing the cle is set up on the stack with
almost entirely constant data and then passed to a function that
converts it into HW specific bit patterns. With the latest
addition, the size of this array has grown to the point that
we get a warning about potential stack overflow in allmodconfig
builds:

xgene_enet_cle.c: In function ‘xgene_enet_cle_init’:
xgene_enet_cle.c:836:1: error: the frame size of 1032 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

Looking a bit deeper at the usage, I noticed that the only modification
of the data is in dead code, as we don't even use the cle module
for phy_mode other than PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_XGMII. This means we
can simply mark the structure constant and access it directly rather
than passing the pointer down through another structure, making
the code more efficient at the same time as avoiding the
warning.
