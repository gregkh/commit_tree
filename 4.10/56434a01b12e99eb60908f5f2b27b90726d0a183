virtio_net: add XDP_TX support

This adds support for the XDP_TX action to virtio_net. When an XDP
program is run and returns the XDP_TX action the virtio_net XDP
implementation will transmit the packet on a TX queue that aligns
with the current CPU that the XDP packet was processed on.

Before sending the packet the header is zeroed.  Also XDP is expected
to handle checksum correctly so no checksum offload  support is
provided.
