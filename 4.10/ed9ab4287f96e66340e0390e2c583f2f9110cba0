HID: usbhid: Quirk a AMI virtual mouse and keyboard with ALWAYS_POLL

Quirking the following AMI USB device with ALWAYS_POLL fixes an AMI
virtual keyboard and mouse from not responding and timing out when
it is attached to a ppc64el Power 8 system and when we have some
rapid open/closes on the mouse device.
