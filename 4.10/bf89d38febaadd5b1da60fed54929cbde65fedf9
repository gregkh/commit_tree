btrfs: split btrfs_wait_marked_extents into normal and tree log functions

btrfs_write_and_wait_marked_extents and btrfs_sync_log both call
btrfs_wait_marked_extents, which provides a core loop and then handles
errors differently based on whether it's it's a log root or not.

This means that btrfs_write_and_wait_marked_extents needs to take a root
because btrfs_wait_marked_extents requires one, even though it's only
used to determine whether the root is a log root.  The log root code
won't ever call into the transaction commit code using a log root, so we
can factor out the core loop and provide the error handling appropriate
to each waiter in new routines.  This allows us to eventually remove
the root argument from btrfs_commit_transaction, and as a result,
btrfs_end_transaction.
