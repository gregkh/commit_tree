net_sched: gen_estimator: complete rewrite of rate estimators

1) Old code was hard to maintain, due to complex lock chains.
   (We probably will be able to remove some kfree_rcu() in callers)

2) Using a single timer to update all estimators does not scale.

3) Code was buggy on 32bit kernel (WRITE_ONCE() on 64bit quantity
   is not supposed to work well)

In this rewrite :

- I removed the RB tree that had to be scanned in
  gen_estimator_active(). qdisc dumps should be much faster.

- Each estimator has its own timer.

- Estimations are maintained in net_rate_estimator structure,
  instead of dirtying the qdisc. Minor, but part of the simplification.

- Reading the estimator uses RCU and a seqcount to provide proper
  support for 32bit kernels.

- We reduce memory need when estimators are not used, since
  we store a pointer, instead of the bytes/packets counters.

- xt_rateest_mt() no longer has to grab a spinlock.
  (In the future, xt_rateest_tg() could be switched to per cpu counters)
