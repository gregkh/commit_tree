net/mlx5: Only cancel recovery work when cleaning up device

Do not attempt to drain the health workqueue when unloading the device in
the recovery flow, this can cause a deadlock when the recovery work
tries to cancel itself with sync.

Because the work is no longer unconditionally canceled when unloading, it
must be explicitly canceled in the AER flow.
