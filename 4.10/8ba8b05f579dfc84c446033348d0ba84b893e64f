s390: kernel: make lgr explicitly non-modular

The Makefile currently controlling compilation of this code is obj-y
meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We replace module.h with init.h and export.h since the file does
export some symbols.
