[media] ti-vpe: get rid of some smatch warnings

When compiled on i386, it produces several warnings:

	./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:457:22: warning: asm output is not an lvalue
	./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:457:22: warning: asm output is not an lvalue
	./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:457:22: warning: asm output is not an lvalue
	./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:457:22: warning: asm output is not an lvalue
	./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:457:22: warning: asm output is not an lvalue
	./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:457:22: warning: asm output is not an lvalue

I suspect that some gcc optimization could be causing the asm code to be
incorrectly generated. Splitting it into two macro calls fix the issues
and gets us rid of 6 smatch warnings, with is a good thing. As it should
not cause any troubles, as we're basically doing the same thing, let's
apply such change to vpe.c.
