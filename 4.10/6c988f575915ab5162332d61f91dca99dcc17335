ecryptfs: use vfs_get_link()

Here again we are copying form one buffer to another, while jumping through
hoops to make kernel memory look like userspace memory.

For no good reason, since vfs_get_link() provides exactly what is needed.

As a bonus, now the security hook for readlink is also called on the
underlying inode.

Note: this can be called from link-following context.  But this is okay:

 - not in RCU mode

 - commit e54ad7f1ee26 ("proc: prevent stacking filesystems on top")

 - ecryptfs is *reading* the underlying symlink not following it, so the
   right security hook is being called
