tipc: remove SS_DISCONNECTING state

In this commit, we replace the references to SS_DISCONNECTING with
the combination of sk_state TIPC_DISCONNECTING and flags set in
sk_shutdown.
We introduce a new function _tipc_shutdown(), which provides
the common code required by tipc_release() and tipc_shutdown().
