x86/mcheck: Move CPU_ONLINE and CPU_DOWN_PREPARE to hotplug state machine

The CPU_ONLINE and CPU_DOWN_PREPARE look fully symmetrical and could be move
to the hotplug state machine.
On a failure during registration we have the tear down callback invoked
(mce_cpu_pre_down()) so there should be no timer around and so no need to need
keep notifier installed (this was the reason according to the comment why the
notifier was registered despite of errors).
