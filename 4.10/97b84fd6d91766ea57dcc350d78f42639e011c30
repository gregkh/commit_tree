l2tp: consider '::' as wildcard address in l2tp_ip6 socket lookup

An L2TP socket bound to the unspecified address should match with any
address. If not, it can't receive any packet and __l2tp_ip6_bind_lookup()
can't prevent another socket from binding on the same device/tunnel ID.

While there, rename the 'addr' variable to 'sk_laddr' (local addr), to
make following patch clearer.
