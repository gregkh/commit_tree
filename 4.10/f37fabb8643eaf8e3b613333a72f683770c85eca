thermal: hwmon: Properly report critical temperature in sysfs

In the critical sysfs entry the thermal hwmon was returning wrong
temperature to the user-space.  It was reporting the temperature of the
first trip point instead of the temperature of critical trip point.

For example:
	/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_crit:50000
	/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/trip_point_0_temp:50000
	/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/trip_point_0_type:active
	/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/trip_point_3_temp:120000
	/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/trip_point_3_type:critical

Since commit e68b16abd91d ("thermal: add hwmon sysfs I/F") the driver
have been registering a sysfs entry if get_crit_temp() callback was
provided.  However when accessed, it was calling get_trip_temp() instead
of the get_crit_temp().
