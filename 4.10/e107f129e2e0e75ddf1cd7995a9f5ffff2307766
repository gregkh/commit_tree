perf sched map: Always show task comm with -v

I'd like to see the name of tasks with perf sched map, but it only shows
name of new tasks and then use short names after all.  This is not good
for long running tasks since it's hard for users to track the short
names.  This patch makes it show the names (except the idle task) when
-v option is used.  Probably we may make it as default behavior.
