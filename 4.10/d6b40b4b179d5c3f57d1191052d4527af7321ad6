drm/i915: New structure to contain GuC logging related fields

So far there were 2 fields related to GuC logs in 'intel_guc' structure.
For the support of capturing GuC logs & storing them in a local buffer,
multiple new fields would have to be added. This warrants a separate
structure to contain the fields related to GuC logging state.
Added a new structure 'intel_guc_log' and instance of it inside
'intel_guc' structure.

v2: Rebase.
