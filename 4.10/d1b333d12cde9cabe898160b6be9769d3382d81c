vfio iommu type1: fix the testing of capability for remote task

Before the mdev enhancement type1 iommu used capable() to test the
capability of current task; in the course of mdev development a
new requirement, testing for another task other than current, was
raised.  ns_capable() was used for this purpose, however it still
tests current, the only difference is, in a specified namespace.

Fix it by using has_capability() instead, which tests the cap for
specified task in init_user_ns, the same namespace as capable().
