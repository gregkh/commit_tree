md/r5cache: r5cache recovery: part 2

1. In previous patch, we:
      - add new data to r5l_recovery_ctx
      - add new functions to recovery write-back cache
   The new functions are not used in this patch, so this patch does not
   change the behavior of recovery.

2. In this patchpatch, we:
      - modify main recovery procedure r5l_recovery_log() to call new
        functions
      - remove old functions
