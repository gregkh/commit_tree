arm64: Remove I-cache invalidation from flush_cache_range()

The flush_cache_range() function (similarly for flush_cache_page()) is
called when the kernel is changing an existing VA->PA mapping range to
either a new PA or to different attributes. Since ARMv8 has PIPT-like
D-caches, this function does not need to perform any D-cache
maintenance. The I-cache maintenance is already handled via set_pte_at()
and flush_cache_range() cannot anyway guarantee that there are no cache
lines left after invalidation due to the speculative loads.

This patch makes flush_cache_range() a no-op.
