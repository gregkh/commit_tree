ovl: check lower existence of rename target

Check if something exists on the lower layer(s) under the target or rename
to decide if directory needs to be marked "opaque".

Marking opaque is done before the rename, and on failure the marking was
undone.  Also the opaque xattr was removed if the target didn't cover
anything.

This patch changes behavior so that removal of "opaque" is not done in
either of the above cases.  This means that directory may have the opaque
flag even if it doesn't cover anything.  However this shouldn't affect the
performance or semantics of the overalay, while simplifying the code.
