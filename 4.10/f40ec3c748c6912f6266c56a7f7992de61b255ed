PCI: Do any VF BAR updates before enabling the BARs

Previously we enabled VFs and enable their memory space before calling
pcibios_sriov_enable().  But pcibios_sriov_enable() may update the VF BARs:
for example, on PPC PowerNV we may change them to manage the association of
VFs to PEs.

Because 64-bit BARs cannot be updated atomically, it's unsafe to update
them while they're enabled.  The half-updated state may conflict with other
devices in the system.

Call pcibios_sriov_enable() before enabling the VFs so any BAR updates
happen while the VF BARs are disabled.
