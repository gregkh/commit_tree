Staging: fsl-mc: include: mc: Kernel type 'int' preferred over 's16'

After following a discussion about the used integer types Dan Carpenter
pointed out that 'int' types should be used over the current change to
's16'. The reason for this is to have an upper bound instead of overflowing
the 's16' so we could still remove devices.
