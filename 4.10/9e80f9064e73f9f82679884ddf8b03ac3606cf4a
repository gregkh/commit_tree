pinctrl: Add SX150X GPIO Extender Pinctrl Driver

Since the I2C sx150x GPIO expander driver uses platform_data to manage
the pins configurations, rewrite the driver as a pinctrl driver using
pinconf to get/set pin configurations from DT or debugfs.

The pinctrl driver is functionnally equivalent as the gpio-only driver
and can use DT for pinconf. The platform_data confirmation is dropped.

This patchset removed the gpio-only driver and selects the Pinctrl driver
config instead. This patchset also migrates the gpio dt-bindings to pinctrl
and add the pinctrl optional properties.

The driver was tested with a SX1509 device on a BeagleBone black with
interrupt support and on an X86_64 machine over an I2C to USB converter.

This is a fixed version that builds and runs on non-OF platforms and on
arm based OF. The GPIO version is removed and the bindings are also moved
to the pinctrl bindings.

Changes since v2
 - rebased on v4.9-rc1
 - removed MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE as in upstream bb411e771b0e
   ("gpio: sx150x: fix implicit assumption module.h is present")

Changes since v1
 - Fix Kconfig descriptions on pinctrl and gpio
 - Fix Kconfig dependency
 - Remove oscio support for non-789 devices
 - correct typo in dt bindings
 - remove probe reset for non-789 devices

Changes since RFC
 - Put #ifdef CONFIG_OF/CONFIG_OF_GPIO to remove OF code for non-of platforms
 - No more rely on OF_GPIO config
 - Moved and enhanced bindings to pinctrl bindings
 - Removed gpio-sx150x.c
 - Temporary select PINCTRL_SX150X when GPIO_SX150X
 - Temporary mark GPIO_SX150X as deprecated
