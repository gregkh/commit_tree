IB/hfi1: Optimize lkey validation structures

Profiling shows that the key validation is susceptible
to cache line trading when accessing the lkey table.

Fix by separating out the read mostly fields from the write
fields.   In addition the shift amount, which is function
of the lkey table size, is precomputed and stored with the
table pointer.   Since both the shift and table pointer
are in the same read mostly cacheline, this saves a cache
line in this hot path.
