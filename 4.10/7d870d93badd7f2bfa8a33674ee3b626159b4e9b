staging: lustre: lov: copy_to_user uses wrong casting

With certain version of gcc lov_obd.c failes to compile
with the following warning.

In function copy_to_user,
inlined from lov_iocontrol at
lustre/lustre/lov/lov_obd.c:1168:
./arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h:735: error: call to
__copy_to_user_overflow declared with attribute warning:
copy_to_user() buffer size is not probably correct

In lov_iocontrol the data was being casted to int instead
of the required unsigned long. This patch changes the cast
to what is needed for copy_to_user.
