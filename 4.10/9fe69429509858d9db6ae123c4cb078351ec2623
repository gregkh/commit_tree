clk: pxa: transfer CPU clock setting from pxa2xx-cpufreq

This is the initial stage to transfer the pxa25x and pxa27x CPU clocks
handling from cpufreq to the clock API. More precisely, the clocks
transferred are :
 - cpll : core pll, known also as the CPU core turbo frequency
 - core : core, known also as the CPU actual frequency, being either the
          CPU core turbo frequency or the CPU core run frequency

This transfer is a prequel to shrink the code in pxa2xx-cpufreq.c, so
that it can become, at least in devicetree builds, the casual cpufreq-dt
driver.
