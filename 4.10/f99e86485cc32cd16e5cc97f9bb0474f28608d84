block: Rename blk_queue_zone_size and bdev_zone_size

All block device data fields and functions returning a number of 512B
sectors are by convention named xxx_sectors while names in the form
xxx_size are generally used for a number of bytes. The blk_queue_zone_size
and bdev_zone_size functions were not following this convention so rename
them.

No functional change is introduced by this patch.

Collapsed the two patches, they were nonsensically split and broke
bisection.
