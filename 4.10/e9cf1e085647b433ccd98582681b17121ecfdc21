KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add new POWER9 guest-accessible SPRs

This adds code to handle two new guest-accessible special-purpose
registers on POWER9: TIDR (thread ID register) and PSSCR (processor
stop status and control register).  They are context-switched
between host and guest, and the guest values can be read and set
via the one_reg interface.

The PSSCR contains some fields which are guest-accessible and some
which are only accessible in hypervisor mode.  We only allow the
guest-accessible fields to be read or set by userspace.
