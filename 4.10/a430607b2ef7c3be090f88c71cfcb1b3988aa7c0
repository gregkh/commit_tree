NFSv4.0: always send mode in SETATTR after EXCLUSIVE4

Some nfsv4.0 servers may return a mode for the verifier following an open
with EXCLUSIVE4 createmode, but this does not mean the client should skip
setting the mode in the following SETATTR.  It should only do that for
EXCLUSIVE4_1 or UNGAURDED createmode.
