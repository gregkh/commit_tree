staging: most: aim-network: fix startup scenario.

In case the networking interface (running on MediaLB) is being started
before the MOST network is, it remains disabled even after the MOST network
has transitioned to active mode.

This patch removes the dependency on the MOST link status to keep the
networking queue active and the networking interface working for the
case described above.
