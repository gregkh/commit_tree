Drivers: hv: ring_buffer: count on wrap around mappings in get_next_pkt_raw() (v2)

With wrap around mappings in place we can always provide drivers with
direct links to packets on the ring buffer, even when they wrap around.
Do the required updates to get_next_pkt_raw()/put_pkt_raw()

The first version of this commit was reverted (65a532f3d50a) to deal with
cross-tree merge issues which are (hopefully) resolved now.
