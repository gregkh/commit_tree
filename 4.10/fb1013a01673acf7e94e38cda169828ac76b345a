intel_idle: Convert to hotplug state machine

Install the callbacks via the state machine and let the core invoke the
callbacks on the already online CPUs.

The two smp_call_function_single() invocations in intel_idle_cpu_init() have
been removed because intel_idle_cpu_init() is now invoked via the hotplug
callback which runs on the target CPU. The IRQ-off calling convention for
auto_demotion_disable() and c1e_promotion_disable() has not been preserved
because only those two modify the MSR during CPU intialization.
