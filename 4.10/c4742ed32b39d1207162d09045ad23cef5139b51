reset: sunxi: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/reset/Kconfig:config RESET_SUNXI
drivers/reset/Kconfig:  bool "Allwinner SoCs Reset Driver" if COMPILE_TEST && !ARCH_SUNXI
drivers/reset/Kconfig:  default ARCH_SUNXI

or

arch/arm/mach-sunxi/Kconfig:menuconfig ARCH_SUNXI
arch/arm/mach-sunxi/Kconfig:    bool "Allwinner SoCs" if ARCH_MULTI_V7

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the few remaining traces of modular macro usage, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
