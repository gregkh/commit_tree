amd-xgbe: Add support for new DMA interrupt mode

The current per channel DMA interrupt support is based on an edge
triggered interrupt that is not maskable. This results in having to call
the disable_irq/enable_irq functions in order to prevent interrupts
during napi processing. The hardware now has a way to configure the per
channel DMA interrupt that will allow for masking the interrupt which
prevents calling disable_irq/enable_irq now. This patch makes use of
this support.
