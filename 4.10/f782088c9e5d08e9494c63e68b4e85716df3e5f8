xfs: pass post-eof speculative prealloc blocks to bmapi

xfs_file_iomap_begin_delay() implements post-eof speculative
preallocation by extending the block count of the requested delayed
allocation. Now that xfs_bmapi_reserve_delalloc() has been updated to
handle prealloc blocks separately and tag the inode, update
xfs_file_iomap_begin_delay() to use the new parameter and rely on the
former to tag the inode.

Note that this patch does not change behavior.
