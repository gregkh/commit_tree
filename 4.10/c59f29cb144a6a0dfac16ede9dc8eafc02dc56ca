tracing: Use SOFTIRQ_OFFSET for softirq dectection for more accurate results

The 's' flag is supposed to indicate that a softirq is running. This
can be detected by testing the preempt_count with SOFTIRQ_OFFSET.

The current code tests the preempt_count with SOFTIRQ_MASK, which
would be true even when softirqs are disabled but not serving a
softirq.
