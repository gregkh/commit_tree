cpufreq: intel_pstate: Reduce impact due to rounding error

When policy->max and policy->min are same, in some cases they don't
result in the same frequency cap. The max_policy_pct is rounded up but
not min_perf_pct. So even when they are same, results in different
percentage or maximum and minimum.
Since minimum is a conservative value for power, a lower value without
rounding is better in most of the cases, unless user wants
policy->max = policy->min.
This change uses use the same policy percentage when policy->max and
policy->min are same.
