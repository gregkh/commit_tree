HID: multitouch: do not retrieve all reports for all devices

We already have in place a quirk for Windows 8 devices, but it looks
like the Surface Cover are not conforming to it.
Given that we are only interested in 3 feature reports (the ones that
the Windows driver retrieves), we should be safe to unconditionally apply
the quirk to everybody.

In case there is an issue with a controller, we can always mark it as such
in the transport driver, and hid-multitouch won't try to retrieve the
feature report.
