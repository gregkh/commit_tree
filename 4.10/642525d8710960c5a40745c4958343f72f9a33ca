MAINTAINERS: drop dri-devel list for i915

In practice, none of the i915 developers Cc dri-devel for strictly i915
specific patches. Make MAINTAINERS reflect reality, and reduce random
i915 specific noise on dri-devel.

Also, we have a fairly large crowd reading and responding on intel-gfx,
and we're pretty good at involving dri-devel when that is appropriate.
