[media] go7007: add MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT dependency

If MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT and VIDEO_GO7007 are both set, we
automatically select VIDEO_OV7640, but that depends on MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT,
so we get a Kconfig warning if that is disabled:

warning: (VIDEO_GO7007) selects VIDEO_OV7640 which has unmet direct dependencies (MEDIA_SUPPORT && I2C && VIDEO_V4L2 && MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT)

This adds another dependency so we don't accidentally select
it when it is unavailable.
