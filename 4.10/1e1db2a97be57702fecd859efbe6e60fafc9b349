staging: lustre: clio: Revise read ahead implementation

In this implementation, read ahead will hold the underlying DLM lock
to add read ahead pages. A new cl_io operation cio_read_ahead() is
added for this purpose. It takes parameter cl_read_ahead{} so that
each layer can adjust it by their own requirements. For example, at
OSC layer, it will make sure the read ahead region is covered by a
LDLM lock; at the LOV layer, it will make sure that the region won't
cross stripe boundary.

Legacy callback cpo_is_under_lock() is removed.
