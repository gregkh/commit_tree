NFSv4: enhance nfs4_copy_lock_stateid to use a flock stateid if there is one

A process can have two possible lock owner for a given open file:
a per-process Posix lock owner and a per-open-file flock owner
Use both of these when searching for a suitable stateid to use.

With this patch, READ/WRITE requests will use the correct stateid
if a flock lock is active.
