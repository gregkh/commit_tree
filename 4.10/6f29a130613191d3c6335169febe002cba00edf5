sctp: sctp_addr_id2transport should verify the addr before looking up assoc

sctp_addr_id2transport is a function for sockopt to look up assoc by
address. As the address is from userspace, it can be a v4-mapped v6
address. But in sctp protocol stack, it always handles a v4-mapped
v6 address as a v4 address. So it's necessary to convert it to a v4
address before looking up assoc by address.

This patch is to fix it by calling sctp_verify_addr in which it can do
this conversion before calling sctp_endpoint_lookup_assoc, just like
what sctp_sendmsg and __sctp_connect do for the address from users.
