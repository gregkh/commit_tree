net: ethernet: ti: cpts: fix unbalanced clk api usage in cpts_register/unregister

There are two issues with TI CPTS code which are reproducible when TI
CPSW ethX device passes few up/down iterations:
- cpts refclk prepare counter continuously incremented after each
up/down iteration;
- devm_clk_get(dev, "cpts") is called many times.

Hence, fix these issues by using clk_disable_unprepare() in
cpts_clk_release() and skipping devm_clk_get() if cpts refclk has been
acquired already.
