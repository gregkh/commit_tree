USB: ohci: da8xx: use ohci priv data instead of globals

Instead of global variables, use the extra_priv_size of
the ohci driver.

We cannot yet move the ocic mask because this is used on
the interrupt handler which is registered through platform
data and does not have an hcd pointer. This will be moved
on a later patch.
