HID: wacom: generic: Support tool ID and additional tool types

Devices following the new Custom HID mode specification (as well as even
some recent component sensors which use the same standard HID usage)
are capable of reporting tool ID information that we need to relay to
userspace. This patch adds support for reading and relaying the tool
type information, which is (unfortunately) split across two usages.
We also advertise the existence of tool types beyond BTN_TOOL_PEN
that might be available.
