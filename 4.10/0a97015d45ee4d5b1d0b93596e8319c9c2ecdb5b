drm/i915: Compress GPU objects in error state

Our error states are quickly growing, pinning kernel memory with them.
The majority of the space is taken up by the error objects. These
compress well using zlib and without decode are mostly meaningless, so
encoding them does not hinder quickly parsing the error state for
familiarity.

v2: Make the zlib dependency optional
