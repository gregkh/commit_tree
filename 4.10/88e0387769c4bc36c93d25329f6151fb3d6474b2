ext4: allow inode expansion for nojournal file systems

Runs of xfstest ext4/022 on nojournal file systems result in failures
because the inodes of some of its test files do not expand as expected.
The cause is a conditional in ext4_mark_inode_dirty() that prevents inode
expansion unless the test file system has a journal.  Remove this
unnecessary restriction.
