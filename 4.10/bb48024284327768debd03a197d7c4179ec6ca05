qed: Prevent stack corruption on MFW interaction

Driver uses a union for copying data to & from management firmware
when interacting with it.
Problem is that the function always copies sizeof(union) while commit
2edbff8dcb5d ("qed: Learn resources from management firmware") is casting
a union elements which is of smaller size [24-byte instead of 88-bytes].

Also, the union contains some inappropriate elements which increase its
size [should have been 32-bytes]. While this shouldn't corrupt other
PF messages to the MFW [as management firmware enforces permissions so
that each PF is allowed to write only to its own mailbox] we fix this
here as well.
