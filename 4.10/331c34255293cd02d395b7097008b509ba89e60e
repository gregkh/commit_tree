i2c: do not enable fall back to Host Notify by default

Falling back unconditionally to HostNotify as primary client's interrupt
breaks some drivers which alter their functionality depending on whether
interrupt is present or not, so let's introduce a board flag telling I2C
core explicitly if we want wired interrupt or HostNotify-based one:
I2C_CLIENT_HOST_NOTIFY.

For DT-based systems we introduce "host-notify" property that we convert
to I2C_CLIENT_HOST_NOTIFY board flag.
