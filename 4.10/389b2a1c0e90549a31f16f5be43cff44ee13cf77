lightnvm: make core.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/lightnvm/Kconfig:menuconfig NVM
drivers/lightnvm/Kconfig:       bool "Open-Channel SSD target support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_misc_driver translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We replace module.h with moduleparam.h because this file still uses
module params to control behaviour.

Also note that MODULE_ALIAS is a no-op for non-modular code.
