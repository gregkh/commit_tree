cpufreq: intel_pstate: Set EPP/EPB to 0 in performance mode

When user has selected performance policy, then set the EPP (Energy
Performance Preference) or EPB (Energy Performance Bias) to maximum
performance mode.

Also when user switch back to powersave, then restore EPP/EPB to last
EPP/EPB value before entering performance mode. If user has not changed
EPP/EPB manually then it will be power on default value.
