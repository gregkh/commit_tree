ARM: imx: hide unused variable in #ifdef

A bugfix added a new local variable that is only used inside of an #ifdef
section, and unused if CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS is disabled:

arch/arm/mach-imx/mmdc.c:63:25: warning: 'cpuhp_mmdc_state' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]

This moves the variable down inside that same ifdef.
