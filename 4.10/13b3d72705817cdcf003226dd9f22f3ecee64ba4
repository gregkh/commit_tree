drm/tilcdc: Recover from sync lost error flood by resetting the LCDC

Recover from sync lost error flood by resetting the LCDC instead of
turning off the SYNC_LOST error IRQ. When LCDC starves on limited
memory bandwidth it may sometimes result an error situation when the
picture may have shifted couple of pixels to right and SYNC_LOST
interrupt is generated on every frame. LCDC main reset recovers from
this situation and causes a brief blanking on the screen.
