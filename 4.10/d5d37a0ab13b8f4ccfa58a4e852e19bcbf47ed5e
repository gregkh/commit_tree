scsi: ncr5380: Pass hostdata pointer to register polling routines

Pass a NCR5380_hostdata struct pointer to the board-specific routines
instead of a Scsi_Host struct pointer. This reduces pointer chasing in
the PIO and PDMA fast paths. The old way was a mistake because it is
slow and the board-specific code is not concerned with the mid-layer.
