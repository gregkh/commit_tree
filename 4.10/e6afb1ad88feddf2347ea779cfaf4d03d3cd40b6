net: korina: Fix NAPI versus resources freeing

Commit beb0babfb77e ("korina: disable napi on close and restart")
introduced calls to napi_disable() that were missing before,
unfortunately this leaves a small window during which NAPI has a chance
to run, yet we just freed resources since korina_free_ring() has been
called:

Fix this by disabling NAPI first then freeing resource, and make sure
that we also cancel the restart task before doing the resource freeing.
