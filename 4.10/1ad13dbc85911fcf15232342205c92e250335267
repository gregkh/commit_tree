NFSv4: Optimise away forced revalidation when we know the attributes are OK

The NFS_INO_REVAL_FORCED flag needs to be set if we just got a delegation,
and we see that there might still be some ambiguity as to whether or not
our attribute or data cache are valid.
In practice, this means that a call to nfs_check_inode_attributes() will
have noticed a discrepancy between cached attributes and measured ones,
so let's move the setting of NFS_INO_REVAL_FORCED to there.
