mm: remove the page size change check in tlb_remove_page

Now that we check for page size change early in the loop, we can
partially revert e9d55e157034a ("mm: change the interface for
__tlb_remove_page").

This simplies the code much, by removing the need to track the last
address with which we adjusted the range.  We also go back to the older
way of filling the mmu_gather array, ie, we add an entry and then check
whether the gather batch is full.
