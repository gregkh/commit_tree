x86/tsc: Make the TSC ADJUST sanitizing work for tsc_reliable

When the TSC is marked reliable then the synchronization check is skipped,
but that also skips the TSC ADJUST sanitizing code. So on a machine with a
wreckaged BIOS the TSC deviation between CPUs might go unnoticed.

Let the TSC adjust sanitizing code run unconditionally and just skip the
expensive synchronization checks when TSC is marked reliable.
