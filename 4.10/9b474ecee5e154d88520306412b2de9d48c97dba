samples, bpf: Add automated test for cgroup filter attachments

This patch adds the sample program test_cgrp2_attach2. This program is
similar to test_cgrp2_attach, but it performs automated testing of the
cgroupv2 BPF attached filters. It runs the following checks:
* Simple filter attachment
* Application of filters to child cgroups
* Overriding filters on child cgroups
	* Checking that this still works when the parent filter is removed

The filters that are used here are simply allow all / deny all filters, so
it isn't checking the actual functionality of the filters, but rather
the behaviour  around detachment / attachment. If net_cls is enabled,
this test will fail.
