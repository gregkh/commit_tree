net/mlx4_core: Fix racy CQ (Completion Queue) free

In function mlx4_cq_completion() and mlx4_cq_event(), the
radix_tree_lookup requires a rcu_read_lock.
This is mandatory: if another core frees the CQ, it could
run the radix_tree_node_rcu_free() call_rcu() callback while
its being used by the radix tree lookup function.

Additionally, in function mlx4_cq_event(), since we are adding
the rcu lock around the radix-tree lookup, we no longer need to take
the spinlock. Also, the synchronize_irq() call for the async event
eliminates the need for incrementing the cq reference count in
mlx4_cq_event().

Other changes:
1. In function mlx4_cq_free(), replace spin_lock_irq with spin_lock:
   we no longer take this spinlock in the interrupt context.
   The spinlock here, therefore, simply protects against different
   threads simultaneously invoking mlx4_cq_free() for different cq's.

2. In function mlx4_cq_free(), we move the radix tree delete to before
   the synchronize_irq() calls. This guarantees that we will not
   access this cq during any subsequent interrupts, and therefore can
   safely free the CQ after the synchronize_irq calls. The rcu_read_lock
   in the interrupt handlers only needs to protect against corrupting the
   radix tree; the interrupt handlers may access the cq outside the
   rcu_read_lock due to the synchronize_irq calls which protect against
   premature freeing of the cq.

3. In function mlx4_cq_event(), we change the mlx_warn message to mlx4_dbg.

4. We leave the cq reference count mechanism in place, because it is
   still needed for the cq completion tasklet mechanism.
