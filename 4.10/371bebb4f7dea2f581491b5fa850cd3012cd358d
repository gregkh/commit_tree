staging: lustre: osc: remove handling cl_avail_grant less than zero

Earlier cl_avail_grant was changed to an unsigned int. Juila
Lawall reported for the upstream client the following which
affects the Intel branch as well:

drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/osc/osc_request.c:1045:5-24: WARNING: Unsigned
expression compared with zero: cli -> cl_avail_grant < 0

Since cl_avail_grant can never be negative we can remove the
code handling the negative value case.
