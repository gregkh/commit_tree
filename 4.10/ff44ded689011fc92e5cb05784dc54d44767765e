ARM: dts: sun8i: replace enable-sdio-wakeup with wakeup-source for BananaPi M1+

Though the mmc core driver will continue to support the legacy
"enable-sdio-wakeup" property to enable SDIO as the wakeup source,
"wakeup-source" is the new standard binding.

This patch replaces the legacy "enable-sdio-wakeup" with the unified
"wakeup-source" property in order to avoid any further copy-paste
duplication.
