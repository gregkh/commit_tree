lkdtm: Do not use flush_icache_range() on user addresses

The flush_icache_range() API is meant to be used on kernel addresses
only as it may not have the infrastructure (exception entries) to handle
user memory faults.

The lkdtm execute_user_location() function tests the kernel execution of
user space addresses by mmap'ing an anonymous page, copying some code
together with cache maintenance and attempting to run it. However, the
cache maintenance step may fail because of the incorrect API usage
described above. The patch changes lkdtm to use access_process_vm() for
copying the code into user space which would take care of the necessary
cache maintenance.
