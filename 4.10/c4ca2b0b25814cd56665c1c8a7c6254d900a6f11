crypto: engine - Handle the kthread worker using the new API

Use the new API to create and destroy the crypto engine kthread
worker. The API hides some implementation details.

In particular, kthread_create_worker() allocates and initializes
struct kthread_worker. It runs the kthread the right way
and stores task_struct into the worker structure.

kthread_destroy_worker() flushes all pending works, stops
the kthread and frees the structure.

This patch does not change the existing behavior except for
dynamically allocating struct kthread_worker and storing
only the pointer of this structure.

It is compile tested only because I did not find an easy
way how to run the code. Well, it should be pretty safe
given the nature of the change.
