spi: fsl-espi: set spi_master members min_speed_hz and max_speed_hz

ESPI has a max and min supported SPI frequency, determined by the
clock divider range. Set master->min_speed_hz/max_speed_hz to inform
the SPI core about these limits.
Then the SPI core handles cases where a transfer requests a frequency
outside the supported range.

So far the driver simply set the lowest supported frequency if the
requested frequency was below the supported range. This is not
necessarily an appropriate action as the device might not support
frequencies greater than the requested one.
With this patch the SPI core will reject transfers requesting a
too low frequency.

The check in fsl_espi_setup can be removed because the SPI core sets
spi->max_speed_hz to master->max_speed_hz if it's not set already.
