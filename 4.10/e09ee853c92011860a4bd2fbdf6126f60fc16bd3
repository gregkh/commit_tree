mei: move write cb to completion on credentials failures

The credentials handling was pushed to the write handlers
but error handling wasn't done properly.
Move write callbacks to completion queue to destroy them
and to notify a blocked writer about the failure

Fixes: 136698e535cd1 (mei: push credentials inside the irq write handler)
