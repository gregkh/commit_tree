drm: rcar-du: Simplify and fix probe error handling

It isn't safe to call drm_dev_unregister() without first initializing
mode setting with drm_mode_config_init(). This leads to a crash if
either IO memory can't be remapped or vblank initialization fails.

Fix this by reordering the initialization sequence. Move vblank
initialization after the drm_mode_config_init() call, and move IO
remapping before drm_dev_alloc() to avoid the need to perform clean up
in case of failure.

While at it remove the explicit drm_vblank_cleanup() call from
rcar_du_remove() as the drm_dev_unregister() function already cleans up
vblank.
