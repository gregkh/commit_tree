hwmon: (nct7802) Fix overflows seen when writing into limit attributes

Fix overflows seen when writing voltage and temperature limit attributes.

The value passed to DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST() needs to be clamped, and the
value parameter passed to nct7802_write_fan_min() is an unsigned long.

Also, writing values larger than 2700000 into a fan limit attribute results
in writing 0 into the chip's limit registers. The exact behavior when
writing this value is unspecified. For consistency, report a limit of
1350000 if the chip register reads 0. This may be wrong, and the chip
behavior should be verified with the actual chip, but it is better than
reporting a value of 0 (which, when written, results in writing a value
of 0x1fff into the chip register).
