drm/i915: Defer transfer onto execution timeline to actual hw submission

Defer the transfer from the client's timeline onto the execution
timeline from the point of readiness to the point of actual submission.
For example, in execlists, a request is finally submitted to hardware
when the hardware is ready, and only put onto the hardware queue when
the request is ready. By deferring the transfer, we ensure that the
timeline is maintained in retirement order if we decide to queue the
requests onto the hardware in a different order than fifo.

v2: Rebased onto distinct global/user timeline lock classes.
v3: Play with the position of the spin_lock().
v4: Nesting finally resolved with distinct sw_fence lock classes.
