audit: move kaudit thread start from auditd registration to kaudit init (#2)

Richard made this change some time ago but Eric backed it out because
the rest of the supporting code wasn't ready.  In order to move the
netlink multicast send to kauditd_thread we need to ensure the
kauditd_thread is always running, so restore commit 6ff5e459 ("audit:
move kaudit thread start from auditd registration to kaudit init").
