ext4: disable pwsalt ioctl when encryption disabled by config

On a CONFIG_EXT4_FS_ENCRYPTION=n kernel, the ioctls to get and set
encryption policies were disabled but EXT4_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_PWSALT was
not.  But there's no good reason to expose the pwsalt ioctl if the
kernel doesn't support encryption.  The pwsalt ioctl was also disabled
pre-4.8 (via ext4_sb_has_crypto() previously returning 0 when encryption
was disabled by config) and seems to have been enabled by mistake when
ext4 encryption was refactored to use fs/crypto/.  So let's disable it
again.
