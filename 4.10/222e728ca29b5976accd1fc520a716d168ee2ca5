ASoC: uda1380: Request GPIOs at bus probe time

Resources should be requested when the device is probed on the control bus
rather then when the CODEC is bound to the sound card. This allows things
like probe deferring and device managed allocations to work.

So move the GPIO request calls from the CODEC probe to the bus probe and
also make them managed along the way.
