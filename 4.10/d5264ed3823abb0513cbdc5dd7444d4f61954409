drm: Return -ENOTSUPP when called for KMS cap with a non-KMS driver

This is an attempt to make the previous fix a bit more robust going
forward.

v2:
* Only allow DRM_CAP_TIMESTAMP_MONOTONIC with UMS drivers (Daniel
  Vetter, Alex Deucher)
* Different logic to keep DRM_CAP_TIMESTAMP_MONOTONIC separate from
  the other caps (Daniel Vetter)
