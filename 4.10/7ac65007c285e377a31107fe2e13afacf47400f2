scsi: libfc: don't set FC_RQST_STATE_DONE before calling fc_bsg_jobdone()

Don't set FC_RQST_STATE_DONE before calling fc_bsg_jobdone() as
fc_bsg_jobdone() calls blk_complete_requeust() which raises a soft-IRQ
that ends up in fc_bsg_sofirq_done() and fc_bsg_softirq_done() sets the
FC_RQST_STATE_DONE flag.
