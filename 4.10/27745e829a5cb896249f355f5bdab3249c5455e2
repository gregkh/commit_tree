drm/i915/execlists: Use a local lock for dfs_link access

Avoid requiring struct_mutex for exclusive access to the temporary
dfs_link inside the i915_dependency as not all callers may want to touch
struct_mutex. So rather than force them to take a highly contended
lock, introduce a local lock for the execlists schedule operation.
