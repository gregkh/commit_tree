iio: inkern: add helpers to query available values from channels

Specifically a helper for reading the available maximum raw value of a
channel and a helper for forwarding read_avail requests for raw values
from one iio driver to an iio channel that is consumed.

These rather specific helpers are in turn built with generic helpers
making it easy to build more helpers for available values as needed.
