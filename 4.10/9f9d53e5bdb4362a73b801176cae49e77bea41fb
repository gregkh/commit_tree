s390/dasd: Fix locking issue when changing RO attribute

The function dasd_ro_store() calls set_disk_ro() to set the device in
question read-only. Since set_disk_ro() might sleep, we can't call it
while holding a lock. However, we also can't simply check if the device,
block, and gdp references are valid before we call set_disk_ro() because
an offline processing might have been started in the meanwhile which
will destroy those references.

In order to reliably call set_disk_ro() we have to ensure several
things:

- Still check validity of the mentioned references but additionally
  check if offline processing is running and bail out accordingly. Also,
  do this while holding the device lock.
- To ensure that the block device is still safe after the lock, increase
  the open_count while still holding the device lock.
