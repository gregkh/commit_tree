md: add bad block support for external metadata

Add new rdev flag which external metadata handler can use to switch
on/off bad block support. If new bad block is encountered, notify it via
rdev 'unacknowledged_bad_blocks' sysfs file. If bad block has been
cleared, notify update to rdev 'bad_blocks' sysfs file.

When bad blocks support is being removed, just clear rdev flag. It is
not necessary to reset badblocks->shift field. If there are bad blocks
cleared or added at the same time, it is ok for those changes to be
applied to the structure. The array is in blocked state and the drive
which cannot handle bad blocks any more will be removed from the array
before it is unlocked.

Simplify state_show function by adding a separator at the end of each
string and overwrite last separator with new line.
