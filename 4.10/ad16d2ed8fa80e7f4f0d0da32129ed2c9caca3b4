drm/i915: Skip unbinding large unmappable global buffers

If the user requests a mappable binding to the global GTT, we will first
unbind an existing mapping if it doesn't match. We will unbind even if
there is no possibility that the object can fit in the mappable
aperture. This may lead to a ping-pong migration of the object, for
example igt/gem_exec_big.

v2: Comment upon the reasoning, or lack thereof!, behind the choice of
magic numbers.

Testcase: igt/gem_exec_big
