irda: w83977af_ir: fix damaged whitespace

As David Miller pointed out for for the previous patch, the whitespace
in some functions looks rather odd. This was caused by commit 6329da5f258a
("obsolete config in kernel source: USE_INTERNAL_TIMER"), which removed
some conditions but did not reindent the code.

This fixes the indentation in the file and removes extraneous whitespace
at the end of the lines and before tabs.

There are many other minor coding style problems in the driver, but I'm
not touching those here.
