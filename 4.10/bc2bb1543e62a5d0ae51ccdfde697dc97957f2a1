scsi: hpsa: use pci_alloc_irq_vectors and automatic irq affinity

This patch converts over hpsa to use the pci_alloc_irq_vectors including
the PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY flag that automatically assigns spread out irq
affinity to the I/O queues.

It also cleans up the per-ctrl interrupt state due to the use of the
pci_irq_vector and pci_free_irq_vectors helpers that don't need to know
the exact irq type.  Additionally it changes a little oddity in the
existing code that was using different array indixes into the per-vector
arrays depending on whether a controller is using a single INTx or
single MSI irq.

[mkp: fixed typo]
