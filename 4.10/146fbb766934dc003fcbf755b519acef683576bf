x86/mm/ptdump: Fix soft lockup in page table walker

CONFIG_KASAN=y needs a lot of virtual memory mapped for its shadow.
In that case ptdump_walk_pgd_level_core() takes a lot of time to
walk across all page tables and doing this without
a rescheduling causes soft lockups:

 NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#3 stuck for 23s! [swapper/0:1]
 ...
 Call Trace:
  ptdump_walk_pgd_level_core+0x40c/0x550
  ptdump_walk_pgd_level_checkwx+0x17/0x20
  mark_rodata_ro+0x13b/0x150
  kernel_init+0x2f/0x120
  ret_from_fork+0x2c/0x40

I guess that this issue might arise even without KASAN on huge machines
with several terabytes of RAM.

Stick cond_resched() in pgd loop to fix this.
