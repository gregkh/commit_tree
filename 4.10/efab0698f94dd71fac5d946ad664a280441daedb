drm/i915: keep declarations in i915_drv.h

Fix sparse warnings:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_drv.c:1179:5: warning: symbol
'i915_driver_load' was not declared. Should it be static?

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_drv.c:1267:6: warning: symbol
'i915_driver_unload' was not declared. Should it be static?

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_drv.c:2444:25: warning: symbol 'i915_pm_ops'
was not declared. Should it be static?
