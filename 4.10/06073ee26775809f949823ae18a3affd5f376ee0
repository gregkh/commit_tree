ARM: 8621/3: parse cpu capacity-dmips-mhz from DT

With the introduction of cpu capacity-dmips-mhz bindings, CPU capacities
can now be calculated from values extracted from DT and information
coming from cpufreq. Add parsing of DT information at boot time, and
complement it with cpufreq information. We keep code that can produce
same information, based on different DT properties and hard-coded
values, as fall-back for backward compatibility.

Caveat: the information provided by this patch will start to be used in
the future. We need to #define arch_scale_cpu_capacity to something
provided in arch, so that scheduler's default implementation (which gets
used if arch_scale_cpu_capacity is not defined) is overwritten.
