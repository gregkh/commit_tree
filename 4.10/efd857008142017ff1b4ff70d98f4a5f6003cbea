route: Set lwtstate for local traffic and cached input dsts

A route on the output path hitting a RTN_LOCAL route will keep the dst
associated on its way through the loopback device. On the receive path,
the dst_input() call will thus invoke the input handler of the route
created in the output path. Thus, lwt redirection for input must be done
for dsts allocated in the otuput path as well.

Also, if a route is cached in the input path, the allocated dst should
respect lwtunnel configuration on the nexthop as well.
