sched/fair: Avoid pulling tasks from non-overloaded higher capacity groups

For asymmetric CPU capacity systems it is counter-productive for
throughput if low capacity CPUs are pulling tasks from non-overloaded
CPUs with higher capacity. The assumption is that higher CPU capacity is
preferred over running alone in a group with lower CPU capacity.

This patch rejects higher CPU capacity groups with one or less task per
CPU as potential busiest group which could otherwise lead to a series of
failing load-balancing attempts leading to a force-migration.
