tipc: fix cleanup at module unload

In tipc_server_stop(), we iterate over the connections with limiting
factor as server's idr_in_use. We ignore the fact that this variable
is decremented in tipc_close_conn(), leading to premature exit.

In this commit, we iterate until the we have no connections left.
