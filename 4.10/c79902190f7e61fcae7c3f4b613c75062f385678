openrisc: restore all regs on rt_sigreturn

Fix signal handling for when signals are handled as the result of timers
or exceptions, previous code assumed syscalls. This was noticeable with X
crashing where it uses SIGALRM.

This patch restores all regs before returning to userspace via
_resume_userspace instead of via syscall return path.

The rt_sigreturn syscall is more like a context switch than a function
call; it entails a return from one context (the signal handler) to another
(the process in question).  For a context switch like this there are
effectively no call-saved regs that remain constant across the transition.
