ACPI / sysfs: Provide quirk mechanism to prevent GPE flooding

Sometimes, the users may require a quirk to be provided from ACPI subsystem
core to prevent a GPE from flooding.
Normally, if a GPE cannot be dispatched, ACPICA core automatically prevents
the GPE from firing. But there are cases the GPE is dispatched by _Lxx/_Exx
provided via AML table, and OSPM is lacking of the knowledge to get
_Lxx/_Exx correctly executed to handle the GPE, thus the GPE flooding may
still occur.

The existing quirk mechanism can be enabled/disabled using the following
commands to prevent such kind of GPE flooding during runtime:
 # echo mask > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe00
 # echo unmask > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe00
To avoid GPE flooding during boot, we need a boot stage mechanism.

This patch provides such a boot stage quirk mechanism to stop this kind of
GPE flooding. This patch doesn't fix any feature gap but since the new
feature gaps could be found in the future endlessly, and can disappear if
the feature gaps are filled, providing a boot parameter rather than a DMI
table should suffice.
