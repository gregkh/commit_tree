net: ipv4, ipv6: run cgroup eBPF egress programs

If the cgroup associated with the receiving socket has an eBPF
programs installed, run them from ip_output(), ip6_output() and
ip_mc_output(). From mentioned functions we have two socket contexts
as per 7026b1ddb6b8 ("netfilter: Pass socket pointer down through
okfn()."). We explicitly need to use sk instead of skb->sk here,
since otherwise the same program would run multiple times on egress
when encap devices are involved, which is not desired in our case.

eBPF programs used in this context are expected to either return 1 to
let the packet pass, or != 1 to drop them. The programs have access to
the skb through bpf_skb_load_bytes(), and the payload starts at the
network headers (L3).

Note that cgroup_bpf_run_filter() is stubbed out as static inline nop
for !CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF, and is otherwise guarded by a static key if
the feature is unused.
