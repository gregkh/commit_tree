ACPICA: Tables: Allow FADT to be customized with virtual address

ACPICA commit d98de9ca14891130efc5dcdc871b97eb27b4b0f5

FADT parsing code requires FADT to be installed as
ACPI_TABLE_ORIGIN_INTERNAL_PHYSICAL, using new
acpi_tb_get_table()/acpi_tb_put_table(), other address types can also be allowed,
thus facilitates FADT customization with virtual address. Lv Zheng.
