regulator: twl6030: fix range comparison, allowing vsel = 59

The range min_uV > 1350000 && min_uV <= 150000 is never reachable
because of a typo in the previous range check and hence vsel = 59
is never reached.  Fix the previous range check to enable the
vsel = 59 setting.

Fixes CoverityScan CID#728454 ("Logially dead code")
