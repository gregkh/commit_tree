scsi: megaraid_sas: For SRIOV enabled firmware, ensure VF driver waits for 30secs before reset

For SRIOV enabled firmware, if there is a OCR(online controller reset)
possibility driver set the convert flag to 1, which is not happening if
there are outstanding commands even after 180 seconds.  As driver does
not set convert flag to 1 and still making the OCR to run, VF(Virtual
function) driver is directly writing on to the register instead of
waiting for 30 seconds. Setting convert flag to 1 will cause VF driver
will wait for 30 secs before going for reset.
