xhci: cleanup error message if halting the host failed.

The old error message always stated that host was not halted
even after trying a certain time.

Host may fail the halt immediately as well with -ENODEV if device
is removed and returns 0xffffffff.

Use a more generic error message and show return value to know if we
failed with -ETIMEDOUT or -ENODEV
