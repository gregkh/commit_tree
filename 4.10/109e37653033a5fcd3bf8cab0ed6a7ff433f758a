md: add block tracing for bio_remapping

The block tracing infrastructure (accessed with blktrace/blkparse)
supports the tracing of mapping bios from one device to another.
This is currently used when a bio in a partition is mapped to the
whole device, when bios are mapped by dm, and for mapping in md/raid5.
Other md personalities do not include this tracing yet, so add it.

When a read-error is detected we redirect the request to a different device.
This could justifiably be seen as a new mapping for the originial bio,
or a secondary mapping for the bio that errors.  This patch uses
the second option.

When md is used under dm-raid, the mappings are not traced as we do
not have access to the block device number of the parent.
