ipv6: addrconf: Avoid addrconf_disable_change() using RCU read-side lock

Just like commit 4acd4945cd1e ("ipv6: addrconf: Avoid calling
netdevice notifiers with RCU read-side lock"), it is unnecessary
to make addrconf_disable_change() use RCU iteration over the
netdev list, since it already holds the RTNL lock, or we may meet
Illegal context switch in RCU read-side critical section.
