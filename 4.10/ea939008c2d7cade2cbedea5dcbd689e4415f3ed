fjes: fix format string for trace output

phys_addr_t may be wider than a pointer and has to be printed
using the special %pap format string, as pointed out by
this new warning.

arch/x86/include/../../../drivers/net/fjes/fjes_trace.h: In function ‘trace_raw_output_fjes_hw_start_debug_req’:
arch/x86/include/../../../drivers/net/fjes/fjes_trace.h:212:563: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]

Note that this has to pass the address by reference instead of
casting it to a different type.

Fixes: b6ba737d0b29 ("fjes: ethtool -w and -W support for fjes driver")
