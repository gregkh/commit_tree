[media] mb86a20s: always initialize a return value

In mb86a20s_read_status_and_stats(), when mb86a20s_read_status() fails,
the function returns the value in variable rc without initializing it
first. Fix this by propagating the error code from variable status_nr.

This bug has been found using clang and -Wsometimes-uninitialized
warning flag.
