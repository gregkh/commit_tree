drm/i915: Disable irqs across GPU reset

Whilst we reset the GPU, we want to prevent execlists from submitting
new work (which it does via an interrupt handler). To achieve this we
disable the irq (and drain the irq tasklet) around the reset. When we
enable it again afters, the interrupt queue should be empty and we can
reinitialise from a known state without fear of the tasklet running
concurrently.
