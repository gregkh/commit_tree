tools build: Add CFLAGS_REMOVE_* support

Adding support to remove options from final CFLAGS for both object file
and build target. It's now possible to remove CFLAGS options like:

  CFLAGS_REMOVE_krava.o += -Wstrict-prototypes

Committer notes:

This comes from the kernel's kbuild infrastructure, the subset that is
supported in tools/ is being documented at tools/build/Documentation/Build.txt.
