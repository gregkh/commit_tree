staging: unisys: visorbus: fix double response

This patch addresses the problem that we were sending double responses
back to the s-Par Firmware when processing CONTROLVM Messages. Every
message responds individually and the epilog functions would send a
response as well.

Since a message could delay the response, it was decided to remove the
extra response from the epilog function.
