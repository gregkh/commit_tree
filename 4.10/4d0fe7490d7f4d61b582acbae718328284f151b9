thermal: core: move trips attributes to tz->device.groups

Finally, move the last thermal zone sysfs attributes to
tz->device.groups: trips attributes. This requires adding a
attribute_group to thermal_zone_device, creating it dynamically, and
then setting all trips attributes in it. The trips attribute is then
added to the tz->device.groups.

As the removal of all attributes are handled by device core, the device
remove calls are not needed anymore.
