HID: multitouch: enable the Surface 3 Type Cover to report multitouch data

There is no reasons to filter out keyboard and consumer control collections
in hid-multitouch.
With the previous hid-input fix, there is now a full support of the Type
Cover and we can remove all specific bits from hid-core and hid-microsoft.

hid-multitouch will automatically set HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS so we can
also remove it from the list of ushbid quirks.
