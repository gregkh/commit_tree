staging: lustre: llog: fix wrong offset in llog_process_thread()

- llh_cat_idx may become bigger than llog bitmap size in
  llog_cat_set_first_idx() function
- it is wrong to use previous cur_offset as new buffer offset,
  new offset should be calculated from value returned by
  llog_next_block().
- optimize llog_skip_over() to find llog entry offset by index
  for llog with fixed-size records.
