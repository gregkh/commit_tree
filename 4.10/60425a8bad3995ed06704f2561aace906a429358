crypto: skcipher - Get rid of crypto_spawn_skcipher2()

Since commit 3a01d0ee2b99 ("crypto: skcipher - Remove top-level
givcipher interface"), crypto_spawn_skcipher2() and
crypto_spawn_skcipher() are equivalent.  So switch callers of
crypto_spawn_skcipher2() to crypto_spawn_skcipher() and remove it.
