autofs: use path_is_mountpoint() to fix unreliable d_mountpoint() checks

If an automount mount is clone(2)ed into a file system that is propagation
private, when it later expires in the originating namespace, subsequent
calls to autofs ->d_automount() for that dentry in the original namespace
will return ELOOP until the mount is umounted in the cloned namespace.

Now that a struct path is available where needed use path_is_mountpoint()
instead of d_mountpoint() so we don't get false positives when checking if
a dentry is a mount point in the current namespace.
