xfs: use iomap_dio_rw

Straight switch over to using iomap for direct I/O - we already have the
non-COW dio path in write_begin for DAX and files with extent size hints,
so nothing to add there.  The COW path is ported over from the old
get_blocks version and a bit of a mess, but I have some work in progress
to make it look more like the buffered I/O COW path.

This gets rid of xfs_get_blocks_direct and the last caller of
xfs_get_blocks with the create flag set, so all that code can be removed.

Last but not least I've removed a comment in xfs_filemap_fault that
refers to xfs_get_blocks entirely instead of updating it - while the
reference is correct, the whole DAX fault path looks different than
the non-DAX one, so it seems rather pointless.
