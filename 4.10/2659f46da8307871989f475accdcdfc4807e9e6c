x86/intel_rdt: Fix setting of closid when adding CPUs to a group

There was a cut & paste error when adding code to update the per-cpu
closid when changing the bitmask of CPUs to an rdt group.

The update erronously assigns the closid of the default group to the CPUs
which are moved to a group instead of assigning the closid of their new
group. Use the proper closid.

Fixes: f410770293a1 ("x86/intel_rdt: Update percpu closid immeditately on CPUs affected by change")
