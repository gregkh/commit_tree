Coccinelle: misc: Improve the matching of rules

Currently because of the left associativity of the operators, pattern
IRQF_ONESHOT | flags does not match with the pattern when we have more
than one flag after the disjunction. This eventually results in giving
false positives by the script. This patch eliminates these FPs by
improving the rule.
