radix-tree: ensure counts are initialised

radix_tree_join() was freeing nodes with a non-zero ->exceptional count,
and radix_tree_split() wasn't zeroing ->exceptional when it allocated
the new node.  Fix this by making all callers of radix_tree_node_alloc()
pass in the new counts (and some other always-initialised fields), which
will prevent the problem recurring if in future we decide to do
something similar.
