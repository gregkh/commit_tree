ASoC: sun4i-codec: Add support for A23 codec

The codec in the A23 is similar to the one found on the A31. One key
difference is the analog path controls are routed through the PRCM
block. This is supported by the sun8i-codec-analog driver, and tied
into this codec driver with the audio card's aux_dev.

In addition, the A23 does not have LINEOUT, and it does not support
headset jack detection or buttons.
