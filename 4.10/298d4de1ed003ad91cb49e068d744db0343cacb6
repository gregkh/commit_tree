i2c: Match using traditional OF methods, then by vendor-less compatible strings

This function provides a single call for all I2C devices which need to
match firstly using traditional OF means i.e by of_node, then if that
fails we attempt to match using the supplied I2C client name with a
list of supplied compatible strings with the '<vendor>,' string
removed.  The latter is required due to the unruly naming conventions
used currently by I2C devices.
