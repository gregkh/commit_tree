md/raid5-cache: fix crc in rewrite_data_only_stripes()

r5l_recovery_create_empty_meta_block() creates crc for the empty
metablock. After the metablock is updated, we need clear the
checksum before recalculate it.

Shaohua: moved checksum calculation out of
r5l_recovery_create_empty_meta_block. We should calculate it after all fields
are updated.
