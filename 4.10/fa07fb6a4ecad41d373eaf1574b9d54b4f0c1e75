workqueue: dump workqueue state on sanity check failures in destroy_workqueue()

destroy_workqueue() performs a number of sanity checks to ensure that
the workqueue is empty before proceeding with destruction.  However,
it's not always easy to tell what's going on just from the warning
message.  Let's dump workqueue state after sanity check failures to
help debugging.
