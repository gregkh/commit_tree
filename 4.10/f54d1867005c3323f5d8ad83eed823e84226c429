dma-buf: Rename struct fence to dma_fence

I plan to usurp the short name of struct fence for a core kernel struct,
and so I need to rename the specialised fence/timeline for DMA
operations to make room.

A consensus was reached in
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2016-July/113083.html
that making clear this fence applies to DMA operations was a good thing.
Since then the patch has grown a bit as usage increases, so hopefully it
remains a good thing!

(v2...: rebase, rerun spatch)
v3: Compile on msm, spotted a manual fixup that I broke.
v4: Try again for msm, sorry Daniel
