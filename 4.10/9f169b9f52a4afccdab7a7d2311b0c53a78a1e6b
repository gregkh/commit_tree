ASoC: dpcm: Avoid putting stream state to STOP when FE stream is paused

When multiple front-ends are using the same back-end, putting state of a
front-end to STOP state upon receiving pause command will result in backend
stream getting released by DPCM framework unintentionally. In order to
avoid backend to be released when another active front-end stream is
present, put the stream state to PAUSED state instead of STOP state.
