arm64: dts: fix build errors from missing dependencies

Two branches were incorrectly sent without having the necessary
header file changes. Rather than back those out now, I'm replacing
the symbolic names for the clks and resets with the numeric
values to get 'make allmodconfig dtbs' back to work.

After the header file changes are merged, we can revert this
patch.

Fixes: 6bc37fa ("arm64: dts: add Allwinner A64 SoC .dtsi")
Fixes: 50784e6 ("dts: arm64: db820c: add pmic pins specific dts file")
