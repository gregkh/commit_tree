staging: lustre: clio: add CIT_DATA_VERSION and remove IOC_LOV_GETINFO

During development a new api, cl_object_obd_info_get()
and cl_object_data_version() which then were later
replaced by a better solution CIT_DATA_VERSION. For
the case of the upstream client their is no point in
introducing a API to only have it removed later. Due
to the way the patches landed with their dependencies
it is not possible to separate out two patches. These
two combined patches do the following:

 * Add a new cl_io type CIT_DATA_VERSION to get file
   data version.
 * Remove the unused IOC_LOV_GETINFO ioctl.
 * Remove ll_glimpse_ioctl() and ll_lsm_getattr().
 * Remove the OBD API method obd_getattr_async().
