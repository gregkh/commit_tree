staging: lustre: ptlrpc: Add a tag field to ptlrpc messages

The new tag field is used as a virtual index for multiple modifying
RPCs management. It is set by the client and allows the target to
release in-memory reply data when the tag is reused by a new RPC.

The tag field replaces the unused last_seen field of ptlrpcd_body
structure.

Additionally, the last_xid field is used to transfer the highest XID
for which a reply has been received and does not have an unreplied
lower-numbered XID.
