tipc: remove probing_intv from tipc_sock

Until now, probing_intv is a variable in struct tipc_sock but is
always set to a constant CONN_PROBING_INTERVAL. The socket
connection is probed based on this value.

In this commit, we remove this variable and setup the socket
timer based on the constant CONN_PROBING_INTERVAL.

There is no functional change in this commit.
