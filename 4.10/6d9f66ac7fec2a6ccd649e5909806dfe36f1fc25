net: phy: Fix PHY module checks and NULL deref in phy_attach_direct()

The Generic PHY drivers gets assigned after we checked that the current
PHY driver is NULL, so we need to check a few things before we can
safely dereference d->driver. This would be causing a NULL deference to
occur when a system binds to the Generic PHY driver. Update
phy_attach_direct() to do the following:

- grab the driver module reference after we have assigned the Generic
  PHY drivers accordingly, and remember we came from the generic PHY
  path

- update the error path to clean up the module reference in case the
  Generic PHY probe function fails

- split the error path involving phy_detacht() to avoid double free/put
  since phy_detach() does all the clean up

- finally, have phy_detach() drop the module reference count before we
  call device_release_driver() for the Generic PHY driver case
