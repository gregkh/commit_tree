xfs: ignore leaf attr ichdr.count in verifier during log replay

When we create a new attribute, we first create a shortform
attribute, and try to fit the new attribute into it.
If that fails, we copy the (empty) attribute into a leaf attribute,
and do the copy again.  Thus there can be a transient state where
we have an empty leaf attribute.

If we encounter this during log replay, the verifier will fail.
So add a test to ignore this part of the leaf attr verification
during log replay.

Thanks as usual to dchinner for spotting the problem.
