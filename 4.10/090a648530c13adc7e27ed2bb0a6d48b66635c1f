staging: lustre: llite: add cl_object_maxbytes()

Add cl_object_maxbytes() to return the maximum supported size of a
cl_object. Remove the lli_maxbytes member from struct
ll_inode_info. Change the lsm_maxbytes member of struct lov_stripe_md
from __u64 to loff_t. Correct the computation of lsm_maxbytes in the
released layout case.
