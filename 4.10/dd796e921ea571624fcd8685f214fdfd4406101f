phy: rockchip-inno-usb2: fix uninitialized tmout variable

The newly added OTG support has an obvious uninitialized variable
access that gcc warns about:

drivers/phy/phy-rockchip-inno-usb2.c: In function 'rockchip_chg_detect_work':
drivers/phy/phy-rockchip-inno-usb2.c:717:7: error: 'tmout' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This replaces the use of the uninitialized variable with what
the value was in the previous USB_CHG_STATE_WAIT_FOR_DCD
state.
