net: Refactor removal of queues from XPS map and apply on num_tc changes

This patch updates the code for removing queues from the XPS map and makes
it so that we can apply the code any time we change either the number of
traffic classes or the mapping of a given block of queues.  This way we
avoid having queues pulling traffic from a foreign traffic class.
