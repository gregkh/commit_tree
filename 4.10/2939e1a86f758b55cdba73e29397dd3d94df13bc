btrfs: limit async_work allocation and worker func duration

Problem statement: unprivileged user who has read-write access to more than
one btrfs subvolume may easily consume all kernel memory (eventually
triggering oom-killer).

Reproducer (./mkrmdir below essentially loops over mkdir/rmdir):

[root@kteam1 ~]# cat prep.sh

DEV=/dev/sdb
mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
mount $DEV /mnt
for i in `seq 1 16`
do
	mkdir /mnt/$i
	btrfs subvolume create /mnt/SV_$i
	ID=`btrfs subvolume list /mnt |grep "SV_$i$" |cut -d ' ' -f 2`
	mount -t btrfs -o subvolid=$ID $DEV /mnt/$i
	chmod a+rwx /mnt/$i
done

[root@kteam1 ~]# sh prep.sh

[maxim@kteam1 ~]$ for i in `seq 1 16`; do ./mkrmdir /mnt/$i 2000 2000 & done

[root@kteam1 ~]# for i in `seq 1 4`; do grep "kmalloc-128" /proc/slabinfo | grep -v dma; sleep 60; done
kmalloc-128        10144  10144    128   32    1 : tunables    0    0    0 : slabdata    317    317      0
kmalloc-128       9992352 9992352    128   32    1 : tunables    0    0    0 : slabdata 312261 312261      0
kmalloc-128       24226752 24226752    128   32    1 : tunables    0    0    0 : slabdata 757086 757086      0
kmalloc-128       42754240 42754240    128   32    1 : tunables    0    0    0 : slabdata 1336070 1336070      0

The huge numbers above come from insane number of async_work-s allocated
and queued by btrfs_wq_run_delayed_node.

The problem is caused by btrfs_wq_run_delayed_node() queuing more and more
works if the number of delayed items is above BTRFS_DELAYED_BACKGROUND. The
worker func (btrfs_async_run_delayed_root) processes at least
BTRFS_DELAYED_BATCH items (if they are present in the list). So, the machinery
works as expected while the list is almost empty. As soon as it is getting
bigger, worker func starts to process more than one item at a time, it takes
longer, and the chances to have async_works queued more than needed is getting
higher.

The problem above is worsened by another flaw of delayed-inode implementation:
if async_work was queued in a throttling branch (number of items >=
BTRFS_DELAYED_WRITEBACK), corresponding worker func won't quit until
the number of items < BTRFS_DELAYED_BACKGROUND / 2. So, it is possible that
the func occupies CPU infinitely (up to 30sec in my experiments): while the
func is trying to drain the list, the user activity may add more and more
items to the list.

The patch fixes both problems in straightforward way: refuse queuing too
many works in btrfs_wq_run_delayed_node and bail out of worker func if
at least BTRFS_DELAYED_WRITEBACK items are processed.

Changed in v2: remove support of thresh == NO_THRESHOLD.
