NFSv4: change nfs4_select_rw_stateid to take a lock_context inplace of lock_owner

The only time that a lock_context is not immediately available is in
setattr, and now that it has an open_context, it can easily find one
with nfs_get_lock_context.
This removes the need for the on-stack nfs_lockowner.

This change is preparation for correctly support flock stateids.
