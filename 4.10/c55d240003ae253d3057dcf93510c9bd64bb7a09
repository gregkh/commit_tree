lkdtm: Prevent the compiler from optimising lkdtm_CORRUPT_STACK()

At least on powerpc with GCC 6, the compiler is smart enough to optimise
lkdtm_CORRUPT_STACK() into an empty function that just returns.

If we print the buffer after we've written to it that prevents the
compiler from optimising away data and the memset().
