irda: Fix lockdep annotations in hashbin_delete().

A nested lock depth was added to the hasbin_delete() code but it
doesn't actually work some well and results in tons of lockdep splats.

Fix the code instead to properly drop the lock around the operation
and just keep peeking the head of the hashbin queue.
