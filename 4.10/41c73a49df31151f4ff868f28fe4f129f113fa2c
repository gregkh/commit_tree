dm bufio: drop the lock when doing GFP_NOIO allocation

If the first allocation attempt using GFP_NOWAIT fails, drop the lock
and retry using GFP_NOIO allocation (lock is dropped because the
allocation can take some time).

Note that we won't do GFP_NOIO allocation when we loop for the second
time, because the lock shouldn't be dropped between __wait_for_free_buffer
and __get_unclaimed_buffer.
