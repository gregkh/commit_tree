drm/amd/amdgpu: port of DCE v6 to new headers (v3)

Port of SI DCE v6 over to new AMDGPU headers.  Tested on a
Tahiti with GNOME through various hot plugs/rotations/sizes/fullscreen/windowed and
staging drm/xf86-video-amdgpu.

(v2) Re-factored to remove formatting changes to si_enums.h
     as well rename various defines.
(v3) Rebase on upstream
