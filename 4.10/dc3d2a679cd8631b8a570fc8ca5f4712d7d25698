thread_info: include <current.h> for THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK

When CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is selected, the current_thread_info()
macro relies on current having been defined prior to its use. However,
not all users of current_thread_info() include <asm/current.h>, and thus
current is not guaranteed to be defined.

When CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is not selected, it's possible that
get_current() / current are based upon current_thread_info(), and
<asm/current.h> includes <asm/thread_info.h>. Thus always including
<asm/current.h> would result in circular dependences on some platforms.

To ensure both cases work, this patch includes <asm/current.h>, but only
when CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is selected.
