tpm_tis: Check return values from get_burstcount.

If the TPM we're connecting to uses a static burst count, it will report
a burst count of zero throughout the response read. However, get_burstcount
assumes that a response of zero indicates that the TPM is not ready to
receive more data. In this case, it returns a negative error code, which
is passed on to tpm_tis_{write,read}_bytes as a u16, causing
them to read/write far too many bytes.

This patch checks for negative return codes and bails out from recv_data
and tpm_tis_send_data.
