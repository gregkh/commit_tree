scsi: ncr5380: Use correct types for device register accessors

For timeout values adopt unsigned long, which is the type of jiffies etc.

For chip register values and bit masks pass u8, which is the return type
of readb, inb etc.

For device register offsets adopt unsigned int, as it is suitable for
adding to base addresses.

Pass the NCR5380_hostdata pointer to the board-specific routines instead
of the Scsi_Host pointer. The board-specific code is concerned with
hardware and not with SCSI protocol or the mid-layer.
