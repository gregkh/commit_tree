mm, fs: check for fatal signals in do_generic_file_read()

do_generic_file_read() can be told to perform a large request from
userspace.  If the system is under OOM and the reading task is the OOM
victim then it has an access to memory reserves and finishing the full
request can lead to the full memory depletion which is dangerous.  Make
sure we rather go with a short read and allow the killed task to
terminate.
