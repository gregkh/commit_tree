cw1200: Don't leak memory if krealloc failes

The call to krealloc() in wsm_buf_reserve() directly assigns the newly
returned memory to buf->begin. This is all fine except when krealloc()
failes we loose the ability to free the old memory pointed to by
buf->begin. If we just create a temporary variable to assign memory to
and assign the memory to it we can mitigate the memory leak.
