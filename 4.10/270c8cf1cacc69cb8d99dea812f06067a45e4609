ARM: 8632/1: ftrace: fix syscall name matching

ARM has a few system calls (most notably mmap) for which the names of
the functions which are referenced in the syscall table do not match the
names of the syscall tracepoints.  As a consequence of this, these
tracepoints are not made available.  Implement
arch_syscall_match_sym_name to fix this and allow tracing even these
system calls.
