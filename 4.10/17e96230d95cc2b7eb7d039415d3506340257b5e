m32r: fix build warning

While building m32r defconfig we got warnings:

  arch/m32r/platforms/m32700ut/setup.c:249:24: warning: 'm32700ut_lcdpld_irq_type' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]

m32700ut_lcdpld_irq_type is only used when CONFIG_USB is enabled.
Modify the code to declare the related variables and functions only when
CONFIG_USB is enabled.
