audit: tame initialization warning len_abuf in audit_log_execve_info

Tame initialization warning of len_abuf in audit_log_execve_info even
though there isn't presently a bug introduced by commit 43761473c254
("audit: fix a double fetch in audit_log_single_execve_arg()").  Using
UNINITIALIZED_VAR instead may mask future bugs.
