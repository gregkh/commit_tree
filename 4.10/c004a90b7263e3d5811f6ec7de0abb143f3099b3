drm/i915: Restore nonblocking awaits for modesetting

After combining the dma-buf reservation object and the GEM reservation
object, we lost the ability to do a nonblocking wait on the i915 request
(as we blocked upon the reservation object during prepare_fb). We can
instead convert the reservation object into a fence upon which we can
asynchronously wait (including a forced timeout in case the DMA fence is
never signaled).
