drm/i915/lspcon: Add workaround for resuming in PCON mode

On my APL the LSPCON firmware resumes in PCON mode as opposed to the
expected LS mode. It also appears to be in a state where AUX DPCD reads
will succeed but return garbage recovering only after a few hundreds of
milliseconds. After the recovery time DPCD reads will result in the
correct values and things will continue to work. If I2C over AUX is
attempted during this recovery time (implying an AUX write transaction)
the firmware won't recover and will stay in this broken state.

As a workaround check if the firmware is in PCON state after resume and
if so wait until the correct DPCD values are returned. For this we
compare the branch descriptor with the one we cached during init time.
If the firmware was in the LS state, we skip the w/a and continue as
before.

v2:
- Use the DP descriptor value cached in intel_dp. (Jani)
- Get to intel_dp using container_of(), instead of a cached ptr.
  (Shashank)
- Use usleep_range() instead of msleep().
