clk: rockchip: optimize 800MHz and 1GHz pll rates on RK3399

Usually, the 800MHz and 1GHz are supplied for CPLL and NPLL in the RK3399.
But dues to the carelessly copying from RK3036 when the RK3399 bringing up,
the refdiv == 6, it will increase the lock time, and it is not an optimal
configuration.

Let's fix them for the lock time and jitter are lower:
800 MHz:
- FVCO == 2.4 GHz, revdiv == 1.
1 GHz:
- FVCO == 3 GHz, revdiv == 1.
