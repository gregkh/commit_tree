genetlink: introduce and use genl_family_attrbuf()

This helper function allows family implementations to access
their family's attrbuf. This gets rid of the attrbuf usage
in families, and also adds locking validation, since it's not
valid to use the attrbuf with parallel_ops or outside of the
dumpit callback.
