kasan: turn on -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope

In the upcoming gcc7 release, the -fsanitize=kernel-address option at
first implied new -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope option.  This would
cause link errors on older kernels because they don't have two new
functions required for use-after-scope support.  Therefore, gcc7 changed
default to -fno-sanitize-address-use-after-scope.

Now the kernel has everything required for that feature since commit
828347f8f9a5 ("kasan: support use-after-scope detection").  So, to make it
work, we just have to enable use-after-scope in CFLAGS.
