drm/i915: Combine seqno + tracking into a global timeline struct

Our timelines are more than just a seqno. They also provide an ordered
list of requests to be executed. Due to the restriction of handling
individual address spaces, we are limited to a timeline per address
space but we use a fence context per engine within.

Our first step to introducing independent timelines per context (i.e. to
allow each context to have a queue of requests to execute that have a
defined set of dependencies on other requests) is to provide a timeline
abstraction for the global execution queue.
