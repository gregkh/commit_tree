ASoC: dapm: Support second register for DAPM control updates

To support double channel shared controls split across 2 registers, one
for each channel, we must be able to update both registers together.

Add a second set of register fields to struct snd_soc_dapm_update, and
update the DAPM control writeback (put) callbacks to support this.

For codecs that use custom events which call into DAPM to do updates,
also clear struct snd_soc_dapm_update before using it, so the second
set of fields remains clean.
