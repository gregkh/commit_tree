drm/amdgpu: check ring being ready before using

Return success when the ring is properly initialized, otherwise return
failure.

Tonga SRIOV VF doesn't have UVD and VCE engines, the initialization of
these IPs is bypassed. The system crashes if application submit IB to
their rings which are not ready to use. It could be a common issue if
IP having ring buffer is disabled for some reason on specific ASIC, so
it should check the ring being ready to use.

Bug: amdgpu_test crashes system on Tonga VF.
