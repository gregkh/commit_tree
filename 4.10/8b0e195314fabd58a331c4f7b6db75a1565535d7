ktime: Cleanup ktime_set() usage

ktime_set(S,N) was required for the timespec storage type and is still
useful for situations where a Seconds and Nanoseconds part of a time value
needs to be converted. For anything where the Seconds argument is 0, this
is pointless and can be replaced with a simple assignment.
