dmaengine: pl330: Fix runtime PM support for terminated transfers

PL330 DMA engine driver is leaking a runtime reference after any terminated
DMA transactions. This patch fixes this issue by tracking runtime PM state
of the device and making additional call to pm_runtime_put() in terminate_all
callback if needed.
