Revert "ALSA: usb-audio: Fix race at stopping the stream"

This reverts commit 16200948d8353fe29a473a394d7d26790deae0e7.

The commit was intended to cover the race condition, but it introduced
yet another regression for devices with the implicit feedback, leading
to a kernel panic due to NULL-dereference in an irq context.

As the race condition that was addressed by the commit is very rare
and the regression is much worse, let's revert the commit for rc1, and
fix the issue properly in a later patch.
