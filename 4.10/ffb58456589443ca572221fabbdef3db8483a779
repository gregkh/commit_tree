scsi: mpt3sas: fix hang on ata passthrough commands

mpt3sas has a firmware failure where it can only handle one pass through
ATA command at a time.  If another comes in, contrary to the SAT
standard, it will hang until the first one completes (causing long
commands like secure erase to timeout).  The original fix was to block
the device when an ATA command came in, but this caused a regression
with

    scsi: srp_transport: Move queuecommand() wait code to SCSI core

So fix the original fix of the secure erase timeout by properly
returning SAM_STAT_BUSY like the SAT recommends.  The original patch
also had a concurrency problem since scsih_qcmd is lockless at that
point (this is fixed by using atomic bitops to set and test the flag).

[mkp: addressed feedback wrt. test_bit and fixed whitespace]
