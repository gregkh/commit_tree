NFS: Be more targeted about readdirplus use when doing lookup/revalidation

There is little point in setting NFS_INO_ADVISE_RDPLUS in nfs_lookup and
nfs_lookup_revalidate() unless a process is actually doing readdir on the
parent directory.
Furthermore, there is little point in using readdirplus if we're trying
to revalidate a negative dentry.
