blk-mq: Move more code into blk_mq_direct_issue_request()

Move the "hctx stopped" test and the insert request calls into
blk_mq_direct_issue_request(). Rename that function into
blk_mq_try_issue_directly() to reflect its new semantics. Pass
the hctx pointer to that function instead of looking it up a
second time. These changes avoid that code has to be duplicated
in the next patch.
