ipc/sem: simplify wait-wake loop

Instead of using the reverse goto, we can simplify the flow and make it
more language natural by just doing do-while instead.  One would hope
this is the standard way (or obviously just with a while bucle) that we
do wait/wakeup handling in the kernel.  The exact same logic is kept,
just more indented.
