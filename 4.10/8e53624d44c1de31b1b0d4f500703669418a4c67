lightnvm: eliminate nvm_lun abstraction in mm

In order to naturally support multi-target instances on an Open-Channel
SSD, targets should own the LUNs they get blocks from and manage
provisioning internally. This is done in several steps.

Since targets own the LUNs the are instantiated on top of and manage the
free block list internally, there is no need for a LUN abstraction in
the media manager. LUNs are intrinsically managed as in the physical
layout (ch:0,lun:0, ..., ch:0,lun:n, ch:1,lun:0, ch:1,lun:n, ...,
ch:m,lun:0, ch:m,lun:n) and given to the targets based on the target
creation ioctl. This simplifies LUN management and clears the path for a
partition manager to sit directly underneath LightNVM targets.
