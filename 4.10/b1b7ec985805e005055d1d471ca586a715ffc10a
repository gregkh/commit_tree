drm/i915: Fix setting of boost freq tunable

For limiting the max frequency of gpu, the max freq tunable
is not enough to hard limit the max gap. We now have also per
client boost max freq. When this tunable was introduced,
it was mistakenly made read only. Allow user to gain control by
setting it writable.
