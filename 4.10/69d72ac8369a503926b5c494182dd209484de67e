scsi: ufs: change device rails hpm mode ramp up sequence

When we are resuming the UFS device rails in HPM mode, we are first
powering on the VCC rail while VCCQ and VCCQ2 rails still being in LPM
mode. Some UFS devices may take VCC on event as hint that host wants UFS
device to be resumed and may start drawing more power from the
VCCQ/VCCQ2 rails (while they are still in LPM mode) causing voltage drop
on these rails. This change fixes this issue by bringing VCCQ & VCCQ2
rails out of LPM before powering on VCC rail.
