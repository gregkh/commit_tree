kthread: add __printf attributes

When commit fbae2d44aa1d ("kthread: add kthread_create_worker*()")
introduced some kthread_create_...() functions which were taking
printf-like parametter, it introduced __printf attributes to some
functions (e.g.  kthread_create_worker()).  Nevertheless some new
functions were forgotten (they have been detected thanks to
-Wmissing-format-attribute warning flag).

Add the missing __printf attributes to the newly-introduced functions in
order to detect formatting issues at build-time with -Wformat flag.
