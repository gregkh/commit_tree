drm/i915: Add lspcon support for I915 driver

This patch adds a new file, to accommodate lspcon support
for I915 driver. These functions probe, detect, initialize
and configure an on-board lspcon device during the driver
init time.

Also, this patch adds a small structure for lspcon device,
which will provide the runtime status of the device.
