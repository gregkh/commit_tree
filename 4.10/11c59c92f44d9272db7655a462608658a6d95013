dax: correct dax iomap code namespace

The recently added DAX functions that use the new struct iomap data
structure were named iomap_dax_rw(), iomap_dax_fault() and
iomap_dax_actor().  These are actually defined in fs/dax.c, though, so
should be part of the "dax" namespace and not the "iomap" namespace.
Rename them to dax_iomap_rw(), dax_iomap_fault() and dax_iomap_actor()
respectively.
