PCI: Activate runtime PM on a PCIe port only if it can suspend

Currently pcie_portdrv_probe() activates runtime PM on a PCIe port even
if it will never actually suspend because the BIOS is too old or the
"pcie_port_pm=off" option was specified on the kernel command line.

A few CPU cycles can be saved by not activating runtime PM at all in these
cases, because rpm_idle() and rpm_suspend() will bail out right at the
beginning when calling rpm_check_suspend_allowed(), instead of carrying out
various locking and assignments, invoking rpm_callback(), getting back
-EBUSY and rolling everything back.

The conditions checked in pci_bridge_d3_possible() are all static, they
never change during uptime of the system, hence it's safe to call this to
determine if runtime PM should be activated.

No functional change intended.
