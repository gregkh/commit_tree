reset: allow using reset_control_reset with shared reset

Some SoCs (for example Amlogic GXBB) implement a reset controller which
only supports a reset pulse (triggered via reset_control_reset). At the
same time multiple devices (in case of the Amlogic GXBB SoC both USB
PHYs) are sharing the same reset line.

This patch allows using reset_control_reset also for shared resets.
There are limitations though:
reset_control_reset can only be used if reset_control_assert was not
used yet.
reset_control_assert can only be used if reset_control_reset was not
used yet.
For shared resets the reset is only triggered once for the lifetime of
the reset_control instance (the reset can be triggered again if all
consumers of that specific reset_control are gone, as the reset
framework will free the reset_control instance in that case).
