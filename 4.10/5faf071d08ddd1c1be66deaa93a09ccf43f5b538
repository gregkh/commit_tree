ASoC: samsung: i2s: Fixup last IRQ unsafe spin lock call

Unfortunately, I seem to have missed a case where an IRQ safe spinlock was
required, in samsung_i2s_dai_remove, when I fixed up the other calls in
this patch:

316fa9e09ad7 ("ASoC: samsung: Use IRQ safe spin lock calls")

This causes a lockdep warning when unbinding and rebinding the audio card:
