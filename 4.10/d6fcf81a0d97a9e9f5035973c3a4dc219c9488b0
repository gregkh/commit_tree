scsi: ufs: suspend clock scaling at the start of suspend

Currently clock scaling is suspended only after the host and device are
put in low power mode but we should avoid clock scaling running after
UFS link is put in low power mode (hibern8). This change suspends clock
scaling before putting host/device in low power mode.
