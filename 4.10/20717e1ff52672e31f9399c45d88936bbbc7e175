powerpc/mm: Fix little-endian 4K hugetlb

When we switched to big endian page table, we never updated the hugepd
format such that it can work for both big endian and little endian
config. This patch series update hugepd format such that it is looked at
as __be64 value in big endian page table config.

This patch also switch hugepd_t.pd from signed long to unsigned long.
I did update the FSL hugepd_ok check to check for the top bit instead
of checking > 0.
