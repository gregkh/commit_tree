raid5: revert commit 11367799f3d1

Revert commit 11367799f3d1 ("md: Prevent IO hold during accessing to faulty
raid5 array") as it doesn't comply with commit c3cce6cda162 ("md/raid5:
ensure device failure recorded before write request returns."). That change
is not required anymore as the problem is resolved by commit 16f889499a52
("md: report 'write_pending' state when array in sync") - read request is
stuck as array state is not reported correctly via sysfs attribute.
