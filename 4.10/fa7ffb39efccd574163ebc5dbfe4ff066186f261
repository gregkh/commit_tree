ring-buffer: Make rb_reserve_next_event() always inlined

The function rb_reserved_next_event() is called by two functions:
ring_buffer_lock_reserve() and ring_buffer_write(). This is in a very hot
path of the tracing code, and it is best that they are not functions. The
two callers are basically wrapers for rb_reserver_next_event(). Removing the
function calls can save execution time in the hotpath of tracing.
