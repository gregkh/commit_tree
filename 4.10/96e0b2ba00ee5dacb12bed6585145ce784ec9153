mmc: tmio: enhance illegal sequence handling

An illegal sequence command error may occur if there is a stopbit or
cmd_index error as well as a CRC error. The correct course of action
is to re-enable IRQs

An illegal sequence data error may occur if there is a CRC or stopbit
error,  or underrun. In this case set data->error correctly.

This is in preparation for enabling tuning support which relies on
differentiating between illegal sequence and other errors.
