IB/hns: Change qpn allocation to round-robin mode.

When using CM to establish connections, qp number that was freed
just now will be rejected by ib core. To fix these problem, We
change qpn allocation to round-robin mode. We added the round-robin
mode for allocating resources using bitmap. We use round-robin mode
for qp number and non round-robing mode for other resources like
cq number, pd number etc.
