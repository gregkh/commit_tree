drm/i915/gen9: Make skl_wm_level per-plane

Having skl_wm_level contain all of the watermarks for each plane is
annoying since it prevents us from having any sort of object to
represent a single watermark level, something we take advantage of in
the next commit to cut down on all of the copy paste code in here.

Changes since v1:
- Style nitpicks
- Fix accidental usage of i vs. PLANE_CURSOR
- Split out skl_pipe_wm_active_state simplification into separate patch
