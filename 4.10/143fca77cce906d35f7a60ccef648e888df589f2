HID: sensor-hub: Move the memset to sensor_hub_get_feature()

While applying patch d443a0aa3a29: "HID: hid-sensor-hub: clear memory to
avoid random data", there was some issues in applying correct version of
the patch. This resulted in the breakage of sensor functions as all
request like power-up will be reset by the memset() in the function
sensor_hub_set_feature().
The reset of caller buffer should be in the function
sensor_hub_get_feature(), not in the sensor_hub_set_feature().
