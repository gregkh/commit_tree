openvswitch: add processing of L3 packets

Support receiving, extracting flow key and sending of L3 packets (packets
without an Ethernet header).

Note that even after this patch, non-Ethernet interfaces are still not
allowed to be added to bridges. Similarly, netlink interface for sending and
receiving L3 packets to/from user space is not in place yet.

Based on previous versions by Lorand Jakab and Simon Horman.
