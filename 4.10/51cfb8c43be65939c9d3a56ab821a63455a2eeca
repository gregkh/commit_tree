staging: lustre: llite: basic support of SELinux in CLIO

Bring the ability to properly initiate security context
on SELinux-enabled client and store it on server side via
extended attribute.

Security context initialization is not atomic, but that would
require a wire protocol change to send security label in the
creation request.

Filter out security.selinux from xattr cache as it is
already cached in system slab.
