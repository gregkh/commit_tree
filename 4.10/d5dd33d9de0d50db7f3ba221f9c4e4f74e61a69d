cpufreq: intel_pstate: increase precision of performance limits

Even with round up of limits->min_perf and limits->max_perf, in some
cases resultant performance is 100 MHz less than the desired.

For example when the maximum frequency is 3.50 GHz, setting
scaling_min_frequency to 2.3 GHz always results in 2.2 GHz minimum.

Currently the fixed floating point operation uses 8 bit precision for
calculating limits->min_perf and limits->max_perf. For some operations
in this driver the 14 bit precision is used. Using the 14 bit precision
also for calculating limits->min_perf and limits->max_perf, addresses
this issue.

Introduced fp_ext_toint() equivalent to fp_toint() and int_ext_tofp()
equivalent to int_tofp() with 14 bit precision.
