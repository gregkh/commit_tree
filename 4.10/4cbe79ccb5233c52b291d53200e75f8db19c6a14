crypto: caam - improve key inlining

For authenc / stitched AEAD algorithms, check independently
each of the two (authentication, encryption) keys whether inlining
is possible.
Prioritize the inlining of the authentication key, since the length
of the (split) key is bigger than that of the encryption key.

For the other algorithms, compute only once per tfm the remaining
available bytes and decide whether key inlining is possible
based on this.
