ext4: fix inode checksum calculation problem if i_extra_size is small

We've fixed the race condition problem in calculating ext4 checksum
value in commit b47820edd163 ("ext4: avoid modifying checksum fields
directly during checksum veficationon"). However, by this change,
when calculating the checksum value of inode whose i_extra_size is
less than 4, we couldn't calculate the checksum value in a proper way.
This problem was found and reported by Nix, Thank you.
