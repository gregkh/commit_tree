ARC: module: Fix !CONFIG_ARC_DW2_UNWIND builds

commit d65283f7b695b5 added mod->arch.secstr under
CONFIG_ARC_DW2_UNWIND, but used it unconditionally which broke builds
when the option was disabled. Fix that by adjusting the #ifdef guard.

And while at it add a missing guard (for unwinder) in module.c as well
