nl80211: Fix mesh HT operation check

A previous change to fix checks for NL80211_MESHCONF_HT_OPMODE
missed setting the flag when replacing FILL_IN_MESH_PARAM_IF_SET
with checking codes. This results in dropping the received HT
operation value when called by nl80211_update_mesh_config(). Fix
this by setting the flag properly.
