Btrfs: fix lockdep warning about log_mutex

While checking INODE_REF/INODE_EXTREF for a corner case, we may acquire a
different inode's log_mutex with holding the current inode's log_mutex, and
lockdep has complained this with a possilble deadlock warning.

Fix this by using mutex_lock_nested() when processing the other inode's
log_mutex.
