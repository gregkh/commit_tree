ipv6: implement dataplane support for rthdr type 4 (Segment Routing Header)

Implement minimal support for processing of SR-enabled packets
as described in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-segment-routing-header-02.

This patch implements the following operations:
- Intermediate segment endpoint: incrementation of active segment and rerouting.
- Egress for SR-encapsulated packets: decapsulation of outer IPv6 header + SRH
  and routing of inner packet.
- Cleanup flag support for SR-inlined packets: removal of SRH if we are the
  penultimate segment endpoint.

A per-interface sysctl seg6_enabled is provided, to accept/deny SR-enabled
packets. Default is deny.

This patch does not provide support for HMAC-signed packets.
