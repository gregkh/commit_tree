Revert "HID: i2c-hid: Add support for ACPI GPIO interrupts"

This reverts commit a485923efbb8 ("HID: i2c-hid: Add support for ACPI
GPIO interrupts") and commit a7d2bf25a483 ("HID: i2c-hid: Do not fail
probing if gpiolib is not enabled") at the same time.

Since commit c884fbd45214 ("gpio / ACPI: Add support for retrieving
GpioInt resources from a device") i2c_core already set the IRQ by
looking into the ACPI tree and retrieving the gpioInt. So we just
have some boiler-plate here that is not needed anymore.

The only downside effect here is that now we are not exiting early
enough if the irq is set to -EPROBE_DEFER or any other error, but
this is going to be fixed in the following patch.
