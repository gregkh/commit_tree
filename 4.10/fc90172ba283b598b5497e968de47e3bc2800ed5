ALSA: line6: Claim pod x3 usb data interface

Userspace apps have to claim USB interfaces before using endpoints in
them (drivers/usb/core/devio.c:checkintf()). It's a lock mechanism so
that two "drivers" don't steal data from each other. Kernel drivers don't
have to claim interfaces to work - but they should, to lock out userspace.

While there, fix line6_properties struct to match checkpatch.pl.
