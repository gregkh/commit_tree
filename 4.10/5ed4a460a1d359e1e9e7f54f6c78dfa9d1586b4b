batman-adv: additional checks for virtual interfaces on top of WiFi

In a few situations batman-adv tries to determine whether a given interface
is a WiFi interface to enable specific WiFi optimizations. If the interface
batman-adv has been configured with is a virtual interface (e.g. VLAN) it
would not be properly detected as WiFi interface and thus not benefit from
the special WiFi treatment.
This patch changes that by peeking under the hood whenever a virtual
interface is in play.
