KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Set partition table rather than SDR1 on POWER9

On POWER9, the SDR1 register (hashed page table base address) is no
longer used, and instead the hardware reads the HPT base address
and size from the partition table.  The partition table entry also
contains the bits that specify the page size for the VRMA mapping,
which were previously in the LPCR.  The VPM0 bit of the LPCR is
now reserved; the processor now always uses the VRMA (virtual
real-mode area) mechanism for guest real-mode accesses in HPT mode,
and the RMO (real-mode offset) mechanism has been dropped.

When entering or exiting the guest, we now only have to set the
LPIDR (logical partition ID register), not the SDR1 register.
There is also no requirement now to transition via a reserved
LPID value.
