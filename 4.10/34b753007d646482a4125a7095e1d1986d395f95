perf bench futex: Cache align the worker struct

It popped up in perf testing that the worker consumes some amount of
CPU. It boils down to the increment of `ops` which causes cache line
bouncing between the individual threads.

This patch aligns the struct by 256 bytes to ensure that not a cache
line is shared among CPUs. 128 byte is the x86 worst case and grep says
that L1_CACHE_SHIFT is set to 8 on s390.
