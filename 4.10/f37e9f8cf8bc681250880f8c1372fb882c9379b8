scsi: ufs: fix condition in which DME command failure msg is printed out

The condition in which error message is printed out was incorrect and
resulted error message only if retries exhausted.
But retries happens only if DME command is a peer command, and thus
DME commands which are not peer commands and fail are not printed out.
This change fixes this issue.
