spi: atmel: remove the use of private channel fields

For DMA transfers, we now use the core DMA framework which provides
channel fields in the spi_master structure. Remove the private channels
from atmel_spi stucture which were located in a sub-structure. This
last one (atmel_spi_dma) which is now empty is also removed.
