ramoops: Split ftrace buffer space into per-CPU zones

If the RAMOOPS_FLAG_FTRACE_PER_CPU flag is passed to ramoops pdata, split
the ftrace space into multiple zones depending on the number of CPUs.

This speeds up the performance of function tracing by about 280% in my
tests as we avoid the locking. The trade off being lesser space available
per CPU. Let the ramoops user decide which option they want based on pdata
flag.
