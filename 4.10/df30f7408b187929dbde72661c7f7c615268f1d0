openvswitch: upcall: Fix vlan handling.

Networking stack accelerate vlan tag handling by
keeping topmost vlan header in skb. This works as
long as packet remains in OVS datapath. But during
OVS upcall vlan header is pushed on to the packet.
When such packet is sent back to OVS datapath, core
networking stack might not handle it correctly. Following
patch avoids this issue by accelerating the vlan tag
during flow key extract. This simplifies datapath by
bringing uniform packet processing for packets from
all code paths.

Fixes: 5108bbaddc ("openvswitch: add processing of L3 packets").
