ata: set ncq_prio_enabled iff device has support

We previously had a check to see if the device has support for
prioritized ncq commands and a check to see if a device flag
is set, through a sysfs variable, in order to send a prioritized
command.

This patch only allows the sysfs variable to be set if the device
supports prioritized commands enabling one check in ata_build_rw_tf
in order to determine whether or not to send a prioritized command.

This patch depends on ata: ATA Command Priority Disabled By Default
