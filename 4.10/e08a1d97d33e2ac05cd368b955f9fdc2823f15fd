drm/nouveau: mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/bios/fan.c:29:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'nvbios_fan_table' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/bios/fan.c:56:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'nvbios_fan_entry' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/clk/gt215.c:184:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'gt215_clk_info' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/fb/ramgt215.c:99:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'gt215_link_train_calc' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/fb/ramgt215.c:153:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'gt215_link_train' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/fb/ramgt215.c:271:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'gt215_link_train_init' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
....

In fact, both functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
So this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
