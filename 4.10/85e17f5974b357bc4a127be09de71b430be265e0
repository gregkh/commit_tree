drm/i915: Move the global sync optimisation to the timeline

Currently we try to reduce the number of synchronisations (now the
number of requests we need to wait upon) by noting that if we have
earlier waited upon a request, all subsequent requests in the timeline
will be after the wait. This only applies to requests in this timeline,
as other timelines will not be ordered by that waiter.
