[media] tvp5150: get rid of KERN_CONT

Unfortunately, KERN_CONT doesn't work with dev_foo(),
producing weird messages like:

	tvp5150 6-005c: tvp5150: read 0xf6 = 0xff
	ff

So, we need to get rid of it.

As we're always printing read/write in hexa when dumping
multiple register values, also remove the "0x" from the
read/write debug messages too.
