fpga: Clarify how write_init works streaming modes

This interface was designed for streaming, but write_init's buf
argument has an unclear purpose. Define it to be the first bytes
of the bitstream. Each driver gets to set how many bytes (at most)
it wants to see. Short bitstreams will be passed through as-is, while
long ones will be truncated.

The intent is to allow drivers to peek at the header before the transfer
actually starts.
