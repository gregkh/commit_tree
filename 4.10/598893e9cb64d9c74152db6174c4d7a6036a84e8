iio: accel: Add driver for the MiraMEMS DA311 3-axis 12-bit digital accelerometer

This driver is based on the DA311 Android driver which can be found here:
https://git.matricom.net/Firmware/kernel_amlogic_meson-common/tree/1e70113a5befd07debb68f537156def84c5be57a/drivers/amlogic/input/sensor
the mir3da_* files are the DA311 driver.

Unfortunately there is no datasheet.
