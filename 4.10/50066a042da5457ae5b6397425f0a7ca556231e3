HID: wacom: generic: Add support for height, tilt, and twist usages

The HID standard defines usages that allow digitizers to report the pen's
height, tilt, and rotation and which are used by Wacom's new "MobileStudio
Pro" devices.

Note that 'hidinput_calc_abs_res' expects ABS_Z (historically used by our
driver to report twist) to have linear units. To ensure it calculates a
resolution with the actually-angular units provided in the HID descriptor
we nedd to lie and tell it we're calculating it for the (rotational) ABS_RZ
axis instead.
