net: bridge: add helper to offload ageing time

The SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_BRIDGE_AGEING_TIME switchdev attr is actually set
when initializing a bridge port, and when configuring the bridge ageing
time from ioctl/netlink/sysfs.

Add a __set_ageing_time helper to offload the ageing time to physical
switches, and add the SWITCHDEV_F_DEFER flag since it can be called
under bridge lock.
