xhci: free xhci virtual devices with leaf nodes first

the tt_info provided by a HS hub might be in use to by a child device
Make sure we free the devices in the correct order.

This is needed in special cases such as when xhci controller is
reset when resuming from hibernate, and all virt_devices are freed.

Also free the virt_devices starting from max slot_id as children
more commonly have higher slot_id than parent.
