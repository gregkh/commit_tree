tcp: tsq: move tsq_flags close to sk_wmem_alloc

tsq_flags being in the same cache line than sk_wmem_alloc
makes a lot of sense. Both fields are changed from tcp_wfree()
and more generally by various TSQ related functions.

Prior patch made room in struct sock and added sk_tsq_flags,
this patch deletes tsq_flags from struct tcp_sock.
