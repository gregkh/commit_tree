clk: tegra: make clk-tegra124-dfll-fcpu explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/arm/mach-tegra/Kconfig:config ARCH_TEGRA_124_SOC
arch/arm/mach-tegra/Kconfig:    bool "Enable support for Tegra124 family"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tags etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
