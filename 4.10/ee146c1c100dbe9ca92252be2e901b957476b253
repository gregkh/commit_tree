KVM: nVMX: propagate errors from prepare_vmcs02

It is possible that prepare_vmcs02 fails to load the guest state. This
patch adds the proper error handling for such a case. L1 will receive
an INVALID_STATE vmexit with the appropriate exit qualification if it
happens.

A failure to set guest CR3 is the only error propagated from prepare_vmcs02
at the moment.
