net: Add support for XPS with QoS via traffic classes

This patch adds support for setting and using XPS when QoS via traffic
classes is enabled.  With this change we will factor in the priority and
traffic class mapping of the packet and use that information to correctly
select the queue.

This allows us to define a set of queues for a given traffic class via
mqprio and then configure the XPS mapping for those queues so that the
traffic flows can avoid head-of-line blocking between the individual CPUs
if so desired.
