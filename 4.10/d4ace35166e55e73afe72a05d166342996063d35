scsi: cxlflash: Cleanup send_tmf()

The send_tmf() routine includes some copy/paste cruft that can be
removed as well as the setting of an AFU command-specific while
holding the tmf_slock. While not a bug, it is out of place and
should be shifted down alongside the other command initialization
statements for clarity.
