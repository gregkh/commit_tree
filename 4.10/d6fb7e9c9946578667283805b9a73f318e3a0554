tipc: remove tsk->connected from tipc_sock

Until now, we determine if a socket is connected or not based on
tsk->connected, which is set once when the probing state is set
to TIPC_CONN_OK. It is unset when the sock->state is updated from
SS_CONNECTED to any other state.

In this commit, we remove connected variable from tipc_sock and
derive socket connection status from the following condition:
sock->state == SS_CONNECTED => tsk->connected

There is no functional change in this commit.
