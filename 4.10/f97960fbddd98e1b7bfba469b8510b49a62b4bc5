kernel/printk: Block cpuhotplug callback when tasks are frozen

The recent conversion of the console hotplug notifier to the state machine
missed the fact, that the notifier only operated on the non frozen
transitions. As a consequence the console_lock/unlock() pair is also
invoked during suspend, which results in a lockdep warning.

Restore the previous state by making the lock/unlock conditional on
!tasks_frozen.
