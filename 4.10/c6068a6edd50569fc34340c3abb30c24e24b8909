thermal: intel_pch_thermal: Support skylake PCH 100 series thermal

This patch uses .driver_data and board_info[] to make per pci device
behavior table (name and ops), instead of adding the code for each pci
device in switch-case. This will make easier to add new pci device
ids.

Then this adds new device id actually for skylake PCH 100 series
(using registers are compatible with currently driver, so no need to
change except adding device id to table).
