vfio-pci: use 32-bit comparisons for register address for gcc-4.5

Using ancient compilers (gcc-4.5 or older) on ARM, we get a link
failure with the vfio-pci driver:

ERROR: "__aeabi_lcmp" [drivers/vfio/pci/vfio-pci.ko] undefined!

The reason is that the compiler tries to do a comparison of
a 64-bit range. This changes it to convert to a 32-bit number
explicitly first, as newer compilers do for themselves.
