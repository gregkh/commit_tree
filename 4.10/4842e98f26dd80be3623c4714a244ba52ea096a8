ALSA: seq: Fix race at creating a queue

When a sequencer queue is created in snd_seq_queue_alloc(),it adds the
new queue element to the public list before referencing it.  Thus the
queue might be deleted before the call of snd_seq_queue_use(), and it
results in the use-after-free error, as spotted by syzkaller.

The fix is to reference the queue object at the right time.
