tg3: Fix race condition in tg3_get_stats64().

The driver's ndo_get_stats64() method is not always called under RTNL.
So it can race with driver close or ethtool reconfigurations.  Fix the
race condition by taking tp->lock spinlock in tg3_free_consistent()
when freeing the tp->hw_stats memory block.  tg3_get_stats64() is
already taking tp->lock.
