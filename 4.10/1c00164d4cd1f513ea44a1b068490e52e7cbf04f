drm/i915/DMC/KBL: Load DMC on KBL using the no_stepping_info array

Currently, for display there is only one DMC image for KBL.
Remove the stepping_info table for KBL and use the no_stepping_info
array for loading the firmware.

v2: Removed the block of code as pointed out by Rodrigo to make the
loads as generic as possible.
