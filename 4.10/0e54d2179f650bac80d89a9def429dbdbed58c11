netfilter: conntrack: simplify init/uninit of L4 protocol trackers

modify registration and deregistration of layer-4 protocol trackers to
facilitate inclusion of new elements into the current list of builtin
protocols. Both builtin (TCP, UDP, ICMP) and non-builtin (DCCP, GRE, SCTP,
UDPlite) layer-4 protocol trackers usually register/deregister themselves
using consecutive calls to nf_ct_l4proto_{,pernet}_{,un}register(...).
This sequence is interrupted and rolled back in case of error; in order to
simplify addition of builtin protocols, the input of the above functions
has been modified to allow registering/unregistering multiple protocols.
