scsi: cxlflash: Cleanup queuecommand()

The queuecommand routine is disorganized where it populates the
private command and also contains some logic/statements that are
not needed given that cxlflash devices do not (and likely never
will) support scatter-gather.

Restructure the code to remove the unnecessary logic and create an
organized flow:

	handle state -> DMA map -> populate command -> send command
