drm/i915: fix comment on I915_{READ, WRITE}_FW

Comment mentioned use of intel_uncore_forcewake_irq{unlock, lock}
functions which are nonexistent (and never were).

The description was also incomplete and could cause confusion. Updated
comment is more elaborate on usage and caveats.

v2: mention __locked variant of intel_uncore_forcewake_{get,put} instead
    of plain ones
