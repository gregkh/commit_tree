netfilter: nat: add dependencies on conntrack module

MASQUERADE, S/DNAT and REDIRECT already call functions that depend on the
conntrack module.

However, since the conntrack hooks are now registered in a lazy fashion
(i.e., only when needed) a symbol reference is not enough.

Thus, when something is added to a nat table, make sure that it will see
packets by calling nf_ct_netns_get() which will register the conntrack
hooks in the current netns.

An alternative would be to add these dependencies to the NAT table.

However, that has problems when using non-modular builds -- we might
register e.g. ipv6 conntrack before its initcall has run, leading to NULL
deref crashes since its per-netns storage has not yet been allocated.

Adding the dependency in the modules instead has the advantage that nat
table also does not register its hooks until rules are added.
