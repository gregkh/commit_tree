PCI: Update BARs using property bits appropriate for type

The BAR property bits (0-3 for memory BARs, 0-1 for I/O BARs) are supposed
to be read-only, but we do save them in res->flags and include them when
updating the BAR.

Mask the I/O property bits with ~PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_IO_MASK (0x3) instead of
PCI_REGION_FLAG_MASK (0xf) to make it obvious that we can't corrupt bits
2-3 of I/O addresses.

Use PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_MASK for ROM BARs.  This means we'll only check the top
21 bits (instead of the 28 bits we used to check) of a ROM BAR to see if
the update was successful.
