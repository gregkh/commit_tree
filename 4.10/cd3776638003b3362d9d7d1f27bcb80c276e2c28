net/mlx5e: Properly handle offloading of source udp port for IP tunnels

We can offload the matching on source udp port of ip tunnels for
decapsulation. We can not offload setting source udp port for tunnels
as part of encapsulation. Fix both the code that deals with matching
offload (decap) and the code that deal with encap offload to align with
that.

Fixes: bbd00f7e2349 ('net/mlx5e: Add TC tunnel release action for SRIOV offloads')
