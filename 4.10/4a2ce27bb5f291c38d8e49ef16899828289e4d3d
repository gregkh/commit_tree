i40e: properly cleanup on allocation failure in i40e_sync_vsi_filters

Currently, we fail to correctly restore filters on the temporary add
list when we fail to allocate memory either for deletion or addition.
Replace calls to "goto out;" with calls to a new location that correctly
handles memory allocation failures.

Note that it is safe for us to call i40e_undo_filter_entries on the
tmp_del_list even after we've deleted filters because at this point it
will be empty, so we don't need to separate the logic for add and
delete failure.
