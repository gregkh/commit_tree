staging/lustre/ptlrpc: Correctly calculate hrp->hrp_nthrs

cpu_pattern can specify exactly 1 cpu in a partition:
"0[0]". That means CPT0 will have CPU 0. CPU 0 can have
hyperthreading enabled. This combination would result in

weight = cfs_cpu_ht_nsiblings(0);
hrp->hrp_nthrs = cfs_cpt_weight(ptlrpc_hr.hr_cpt_table, i);
hrp->hrp_nthrs /= weight;

evaluating to 0. Where
cfs_cpt_weight(ptlrpc_hr.hr_cpt_table, i) == 1
weight == 2

Therefore, if hrp_nthrs becomes zero, just set it to 1.
