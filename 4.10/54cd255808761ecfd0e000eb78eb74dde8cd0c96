dmaengine: dma_slave_config: add support for slave port window

Some slave devices uses address window instead of single register for read
and/or write of data. With the src/dst_port_window_size the address window
can be specified and the DMAengine driver should use this information to
correctly set up the transfer to loop within the provided window.
