soc: Support for NPS HW scheduling

This new header file is for NPS400 SoC (part of ARC architecture).
The header file includes macros for save/restore of HW scheduling.
The control of HW scheduling is achieved by writing core registers.
This code was moved from arc/plat-eznps so it can be used
from drivers/clocksource/, available only for CONFIG_EZNPS_MTM_EXT.
