mmc: sdhci: Fix to handle MMC_POWER_UNDEFINED

Since commit c2c24819b280 ("mmc: core: Don't power off the card when
starting the host"), the power state can still be MMC_POWER_UNDEFINED after
mmc_start_host() is called. That can trigger a warning in SDHCI during
runtime resume as it tries to restore the I/O state. Handle
MMC_POWER_UNDEFINED simply by not updating the I/O state in that case.
