drm/bridge: analogix: Don't return -EINVAL when panel doesn't support PSR

We will ignored PSR setting if panel not support it. So, in this case,
we should return from analogix_dp_enable/disable_psr() without any
error code. Let's retrun 0 instead of -EINVAL when panel not support PSR
in analogix_dp_enable/disable_psr().
