cfg80211: Add support to update connection parameters

Add functionality to update the connection parameters when in connected
state, so that driver/firmware uses the updated parameters for
subsequent roaming. This is for drivers that support internal BSS
selection and roaming. The new command does not change the current
association state, i.e., it can be used to update IE contents for future
(re)associations without causing an immediate disassociation or
reassociation with the current BSS.

This commit implements the required functionality for updating IEs for
(Re)Association Request frame only. Other parameters can be added in
future when required.
