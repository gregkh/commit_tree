xen-blkfront: feature flags handling adjustments

Don't truncate the "feature-persistent" value read from xenstore: Any
non-zero value is supposed to enable the feature, just like is already
being done for feature_secdiscard.

Just like the other feature_* fields, feature_flush and feature_fua are
boolean flags, and hence fit well into a single bit.

Keep all bit fields together to limit gaps.
