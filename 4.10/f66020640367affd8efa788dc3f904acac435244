mfd: tps65217: Specify the IRQ name

TPS65217 MFD is an interrupt controller and MFD slave devices like
tps65217-charger and tps65217-pwrbutton request an interrupt to handle
each HW event.

Currently, TPS65217 IRQ name is not defined, so the result is as below.

root@arm:~# cat /proc/interrupts
...
182:          0      INTC   7 Level     tps65217-irq
183:          0         -   1 Edge      tps65217-charger
185:          0         -   2 Edge      tps65217_pwrbutton

This patch specifies the name of the interrupt controller.

182:          0      INTC   7 Level     tps65217-irq
183:          0  tps65217   1 Edge      tps65217-charger
185:          0  tps65217   2 Edge      tps65217_pwrbutton
