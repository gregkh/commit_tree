ax25: Fix segfault after sock connection timeout

The ax.25 socket connection timed out & the sock struct has been
previously taken down ie. sock struct is now a NULL pointer. Checking
the sock_flag causes the segfault.  Check if the socket struct pointer
is NULL before checking sock_flag. This segfault is seen in
timed out netrom connections.

Please submit to -stable.
