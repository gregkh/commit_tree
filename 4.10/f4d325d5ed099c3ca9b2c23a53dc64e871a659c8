hwmon: (core) Clarify use of chip attributes

Describing chip attributes as "attributes which apply to the entire chip"
is confusing. Rephrase to "attributes which are not bound to a specific
input or output".

Also rename hwmon_chip_attr_templates[] to hwmon_chip_attrs[] to indicate
that the respective strings strings are not templates but actual attribute
names.
