pstore: Convert console write to use ->write_buf

Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't know why it needs to copy the
input buffer to psinfo->buf and then write.  Instead we can write the
input buffer directly.  The only implementation that supports console
message (i.e. ramoops) already does it for ftrace messages.

For the upcoming virtio backend driver, it needs to protect psinfo->buf
overwritten from console messages.  If it could use ->write_buf method
instead of ->write, the problem will be solved easily.
