mmc: sdhci: put together into one condition checking

value of ios->timing is not related with SDCHI v3.0.  If Controller version
is v3.0, SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_HISPD_BIT is meaningless.  To prevent the setting
wrong bit moves into one condition checking.  (e.g sdhci-s3c doesn't use
SDHCI_CTRL_HISPD bit, instead using this bit as other purpose.)
