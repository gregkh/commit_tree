i40e: Implementation of ERROR state for NVM update state machine

This patch adds I40E_NVMUPD_STATE_ERROR state for NVM update.
Without this patch driver has no possibility to return NVM image write
failure.This state is being set when ARQ rises error.
arq_last_status is also updated every time when ARQ event comes,
not only on error cases.
