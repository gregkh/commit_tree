Btrfs: fix truncate down when no_holes feature is enabled

For such a file mapping,

[0-4k][hole][8k-12k]

In NO_HOLES mode, we don't have the [hole] extent any more.
Commit c1aa45759e90 ("Btrfs: fix shrinking truncate when the no_holes feature is enabled")
 fixed disk isize not being updated in NO_HOLES mode when data is not flushed.

However, even if data has been flushed, we can still have trouble
in updating disk isize since we updated disk isize to 'start' of
the last evicted extent.
