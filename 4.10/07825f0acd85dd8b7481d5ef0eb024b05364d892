crypto: aesni - Fix failure when built-in with modular pcbc

If aesni is built-in but pcbc is built as a module, then aesni
will fail completely because when it tries to register the pcbc
variant of aes the pcbc template is not available.

This patch fixes this by modifying the pcbc presence test so that
if aesni is built-in then pcbc must also be built-in for it to be
used by aesni.
