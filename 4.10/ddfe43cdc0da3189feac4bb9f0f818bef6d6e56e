x86/amd_nb: Add SMN and Indirect Data Fabric access for AMD Fam17h

Some devices on Fam17h can only be accessed through the System Management
Network (SMN). The SMN is accessed by a pair of index/data registers in PCI
config space. Add a pair of functions to read from and write to the SMN.

The Data Fabric on Fam17h allows multiple devices to use the same register
space. The registers of a specific device are accessed indirectly using the
device's DF InstanceId. Currently, we only need to read from these devices,
so only define a read function for now.
