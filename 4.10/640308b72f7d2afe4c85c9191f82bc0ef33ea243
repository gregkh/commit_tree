USB: ohci: da8xx: Resume the entire host controller

The da8xx ohci controller is not working after suspend and resume.

This is because only the root hub is being resumed.

Balance the ohci_suspend of the suspend path with an ohci_resume
in the resume path so that we resume the entire controller, and not
just the root hub.

Also, while we are here, remove setting device power_state,
as this is no longer needed and scheduled for removal
