cpufreq: pxa: use generic platdev driver for device-tree

For device-tree based pxa25x and pxa27x platforms, cpufreq-dt driver is
doing the job as well as pxa2xx-cpufreq, so add these platforms to the
compatibility list.

This won't work for legacy non device-tree platforms where
pxa2xx-cpufreq is still required.
