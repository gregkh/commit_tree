orinoco: Use shash instead of ahash for MIC calculations

Eric Biggers pointed out that the orinoco driver pointed scatterlists
at the stack.

Fix it by switching from ahash to shash.  The result should be
simpler, faster, and more correct.

kvalo: cherry picked from commit 1fef293b8a9850cfa124a53c1d8878d355010403 as I
accidentally applied this patch to wireless-drivers-next when I was supposed to
apply this wireless-drivers
