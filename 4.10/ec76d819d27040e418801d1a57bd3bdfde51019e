KVM: Export kvm module parameter variables

The kvm module has the parameters halt_poll_ns, halt_poll_ns_grow, and
halt_poll_ns_shrink. Halt polling was recently added to the powerpc kvm-hv
module and these parameters were essentially duplicated for that. There is
no benefit to this duplication and it can lead to confusion when trying to
tune halt polling.

Thus move the definition of these variables to kvm_host.h and export them.
This will allow the kvm-hv module to use the same module parameters by
accessing these variables, which will be implemented in the next patch,
meaning that they will no longer be duplicated.
