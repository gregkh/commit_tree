ipvlan: fix various issues in ipvlan_process_multicast()

1) netif_rx() / dev_forward_skb() should not be called from process
context.

2) ipvlan_count_rx() should be called with preemption disabled.

3) We should check if ipvlan->dev is up before feeding packets
to netif_rx()

4) We need to prevent device from disappearing if some packets
are in the multicast backlog.

5) One kfree_skb() should be a consume_skb() eventually
