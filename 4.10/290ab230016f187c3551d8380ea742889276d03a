ext4: don't read out of bounds when checking for in-inode xattrs

With i_extra_isize equal to or close to the available space, it was
possible for us to read past the end of the inode when trying to detect
or validate in-inode xattrs.  Fix this by checking for the needed extra
space first.

This patch shouldn't have any noticeable effect on
non-corrupted/non-malicious filesystems.
