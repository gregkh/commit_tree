ARM: OMAP5: Add basic cpuidle MPU CSWR support

Add OMAP5 CPUIDLE support.

This patch adds MPUSS low power states in cpuidle.

        C1 - CPU0 WFI + CPU1 WFI + MPU ON
        C2 - CPU0 RET + CPU1 RET + MPU CSWR

Modified from TI kernel tree commit 605967fd2205 ("ARM: DRA7: PM:
cpuidle MPU CSWR support") except enable cpuidle for omap5 instead
of dra7.

According to Nishanth Menon <nm@ti.com>, cpuidle on dra7 is not
supported properly in the hardware so we don't want to enable it.
However, for omap5 this adds some nice power savings. Note that
the TI 3.8 based tree has other cpuidle states that we may be able
to enable later on.

On omap5-uevm, the power consumption eventually settles down to about
920mW with ehci-omap and ohci-omap3 unloaded compared to about 1.7W
without these patches. Note that it seems to take few minutes after
booting for the idle power to go down to 920mW from 1.3W, no idea so
far what might be causing that.
