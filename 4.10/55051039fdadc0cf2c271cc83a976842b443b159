staging: lustre: lov: remove LSM from struct lustre_md

In struct lustre_md replace the struct lov_stripe_md *lsm member with
an opaque struct lu_buf layout which holds the layout metadata
returned by the server. Refactor the LOV object initialization and
layout change code to accommodate this. Simplify lov_unpackmd() and
supporting functions according to the reduced number of use cases.
