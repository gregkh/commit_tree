tracing: Have the reg function allow to fail

Some tracepoints have a registration function that gets enabled when the
tracepoint is enabled. There may be cases that the registraction function
must fail (for example, can't allocate enough memory). In this case, the
tracepoint should also fail to register, otherwise the user would not know
why the tracepoint is not working.
