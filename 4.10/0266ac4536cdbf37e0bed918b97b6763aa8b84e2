i40e: don't truncate match_method assignment

The .match_method field is a u8, so we shouldn't be casting to a u16,
and because it is only one byte, we do not need to byte swap anything.
Just assign the value directly. This avoids issues on Big Endian
architectures which would have byte swapped and then incorrectly
truncated the value.
