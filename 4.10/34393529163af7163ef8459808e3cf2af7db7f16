be2net: fix MAC addr setting on privileged BE3 VFs

During interface opening MAC address stored in netdev->dev_addr is
programmed in the HW with exception of BE3 VFs where the initial
MAC is programmed by parent PF. This is OK when MAC address is not
changed when an interfaces is down. In this case the requested MAC is
stored to netdev->dev_addr and later is stored into HW during opening.
But this is not done for all BE3 VFs so the NIC HW does not know
anything about this change and all traffic is filtered.

This is the case of bonding if fail_over_mac == 0 where the MACs of
the slaves are changed while they are down.

The be2net behavior is too restrictive because if a BE3 VF has
the FILTMGMT privilege then it is able to modify its MAC without
any restriction.

To solve the described problem the driver should take care about these
privileged BE3 VFs so the MAC is programmed during opening. And by
contrast unpriviled BE3 VFs should not be allowed to change its MAC
in any case.
