drm: Don't race connector registration

I was under the misconception that the sysfs dev stuff can be fully
set up, and then registered all in one step with device_add. That's
true for properties and property groups, but not for parents and child
devices. Those must be fully registered before you can register a
child.

Add a bit of tracking to make sure that asynchronous mst connector
hotplugging gets this right. For consistency we rely upon the implicit
barriers of the connector->mutex, which is taken anyway, to ensure
that at least either the connector or device registration call will
work out.

Mildly tested since I can't reliably reproduce this on my mst box
here.
