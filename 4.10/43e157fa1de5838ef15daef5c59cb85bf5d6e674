drm/i915: i915_pages_create_for_stolen should return err ptr

When gathering the pages from our backing storage we expect get_pages()
to either give us our sg_table or an err ptr. However when gathering our
fake pages for stolen memory we may return NULL in the event of a
failure. To prevent any funny business we should therefore return the
proper err ptr value.
