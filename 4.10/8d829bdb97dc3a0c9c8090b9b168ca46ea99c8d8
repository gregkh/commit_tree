bpf, cls: consolidate prog deletion path

Commit 18cdb37ebf4c ("net: sched: do not use tcf_proto 'tp' argument from
call_rcu") removed the last usage of tp from cls_bpf_delete_prog(), so also
remove it from the function as argument to not give a wrong impression. tp
is illegal to access from this callback, since it could already have been
freed.

Refactor the deletion code a bit, so that cls_bpf_destroy() can call into
the same code for prog deletion as cls_bpf_delete() op, instead of having
it unnecessarily duplicated.
