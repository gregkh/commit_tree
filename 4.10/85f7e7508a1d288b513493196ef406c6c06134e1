tcp: add cwnd_undo functions to various tcp cc algorithms

congestion control algorithms that do not halve cwnd in their .ssthresh
should provide a .cwnd_undo rather than rely on current fallback which
assumes reno halving (and thus doubles the cwnd).

All of these do 'something else' in their .ssthresh implementation, thus
store the cwnd on loss and provide .undo_cwnd to restore it again.

A followup patch will remove the fallback and all algorithms will
need to provide a .cwnd_undo function.
