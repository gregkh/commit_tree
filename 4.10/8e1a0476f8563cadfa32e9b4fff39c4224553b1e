KVM: arm/arm64: timer: Check for properly initialized timer on init

When the arch timer code fails to initialize (for example because the
memory mapped timer doesn't work, which is currently seen with the AEM
model), then KVM just continues happily with a final result that KVM
eventually does a NULL pointer dereference of the uninitialized cycle
counter.

Check directly for this in the init path and give the user a reasonable
error in this case.
