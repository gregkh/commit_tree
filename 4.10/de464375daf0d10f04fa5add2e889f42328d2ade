bpf: Remove unused but set variables

Remove the unused but set variables min_set and max_set in
adjust_reg_min_max_vals to fix the following warning when building with
'W=1':

  kernel/bpf/verifier.c:1483:7: warning: variable ‘min_set’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

There is no warning about max_set being unused, but since it is only
used in the assignment of min_set it can be removed as well.

They were introduced in commit 484611357c19 ("bpf: allow access into map
value arrays") but seem to have never been used.
