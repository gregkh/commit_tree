x86/vmware: Use tsc_khz value for calibrate_cpu()

Commit aa297292d708 ("x86/tsc: Enumerate SKL cpu_khz and tsc_khz via
CPUID") separated the calibration mechanisms for cpu_khz and tsc_khz.

Since the vmware hypervisor provides a constant frequency TSC to the guest,
this change can lead to divergence between the tsc and the cpu frequency
after vmotion, which might confuse the user.

Solve this by overriding the x86 platform cpu calibration callback with the
vmware specific tsc calibration function.
