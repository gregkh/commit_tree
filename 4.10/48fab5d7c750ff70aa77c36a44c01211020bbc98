ovl: fix nested overlayfs mount

When the upper overlayfs checks "trusted.overlay.*" xattr on the underlying
overlayfs mount, it gets -EPERM, which confuses the upper overlayfs.

Fix this by returning -EOPNOTSUPP instead of -EPERM from
ovl_own_xattr_get() and ovl_own_xattr_set().  This behavior is consistent
with the behavior of ovl_listxattr(), which filters out the private
overlayfs xattrs.

Note: nested overlays are deprecated.  But this change makes sense
regardless: these xattrs are private to the overlay and should always be
hidden.  Hence getting and setting them should indicate this.

[SzMi: Use EOPNOTSUPP instead of ENODATA and use it for both getting and
setting "trusted.overlay." xattrs.  This is a perfectly valid error code
for "we don't support this prefix", which is the case here.]
