i40e: factor out addition/deletion of VLAN per each MAC address

A future refactor of how the PF assigns a PVID to a VF will want to be
able to add and remove a block of filters by VLAN without worrying about
accidentally triggering the accounting for I40E_VLAN_ANY. Additionally
the PVID assignment would like to be able to batch several changes under
one use of the mac_filter_hash_lock.

Factor out the addition and deletion of a VLAN on all MACs into their
own function which i40e_vsi_(add|kill)_vlan can use. These new functions
expect the caller to take the hash lock, as well as perform any
necessary accounting for updating I40E_VLAN_ANY filters if we are now
operating under VLAN mode.
