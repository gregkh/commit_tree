ARM: dts: imx: Pass 'chosen' and 'memory' nodes

Commit 7f107887d199 ("ARM: dts: imx: Remove skeleton.dtsi") causes boot
issues when the bootloader does not create a 'chosen' node if such node
is not present in the dtb.

The reason for the boot failure is well explained by Javier Martinez
Canillas: "the decompressor relies on a pre-existing chosen node to be
available to insert the command line and merge other ATAGS info."

, so pass an empty 'chosen' node to fix the boot problem.

This issue has been seen in the kernelci reports with Barebox as
bootloader.

Also pass the 'memory' node in order to fix boot issues on the SolidRun
iMX6 platforms.
