MAINTAINERS: remove duplicate bug filling description

I have noticed that two different descriptions for B: entries in
MAINTAINERS were merged: commit 686564434e88 ("MAINTAINERS: Add bug
tracking system location entry type") and 2de2bd95f456 ("MAINTAINERS:
add "B:" for URI where to file bugs").

This patch keeps the description from 2de2bd95f456.  There has been a
discussion [1] about whether this more detailed description is useful
and what it exactly implies.  I find it more useful and general, and the
author of 686564434e88 agreed in the end that either is fine.
