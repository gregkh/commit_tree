IB/hfi1: Optimize devdata cachelines

Profiling shows hot path struct members that need
to be in a minimum set of cachelines.

Group these struct member in the same cacheline:
	sc2vl_lock
	sc2vl
	rhf_rcv_function_map
	rcv_limit
	rhf_offset

Group these struct member in the same cacheline:
	process_pio_send
	process_dma_send
	pport
	rcd
	int_counter
	flags
	num_pports
	first_user_ctxt

Fill holes in struct hfi1_devdata revealed by pahole.
