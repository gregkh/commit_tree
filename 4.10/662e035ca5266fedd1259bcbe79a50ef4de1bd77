staging: lustre: lmv: allow cross-MDT rename and link

Remove checks for cross-MDT operation, so cross-MDT
rename and link will be allowed.

Remove obsolete locality parameters in MDT lock API after all of
cross-MDT operations are allowed.

This is the client side changed only so the upstream
client can support this.
