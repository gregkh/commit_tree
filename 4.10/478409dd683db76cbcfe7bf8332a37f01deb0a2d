tracing: Add hook to function tracing for other subsystems to use

Currently Function traces can be only exported to the ring buffer. This
adds a trace_export concept which can process traces and export
them to a registered destination as an addition to the current
one that outputs to Ftrace - i.e. ring buffer.

In this way, if we want function traces to be sent to other destinations
rather than only to the ring buffer, we just need to register a new
trace_export and implement its own .write() function for writing traces to
storage.

With this patch, only function tracing (trace type is TRACE_FN)
is supported.
