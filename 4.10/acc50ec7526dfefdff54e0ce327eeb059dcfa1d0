s390: virtio: make ccw explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/s390/Kconfig:config S390_GUEST
arch/s390/Kconfig:      def_bool y

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We replace module.h with moduleparam.h since the file does declare
some module_param() and leaving that as-is is currently the easiest
way to remain compatible with existing boot arg use cases.
