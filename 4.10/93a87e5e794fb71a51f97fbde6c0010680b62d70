mlxsw: spectrum_router: Don't reflect dead neighs

When a neighbour is considered to be dead, we should remove it from the
device's table regardless of its NUD state.

Without this patch, after setting a port to be administratively down we
get the following errors when we periodically try to update the kernel
about neighbours activity:

[  461.947268] mlxsw_spectrum 0000:03:00.0 sw1p3: Failed to find
matching neighbour for IP=192.168.100.2
