x86/efi: Don't allocate memmap through memblock after mm_init()

With the following commit:

  4bc9f92e64c8 ("x86/efi-bgrt: Use efi_mem_reserve() to avoid copying image data")

...  efi_bgrt_init() calls into the memblock allocator through
efi_mem_reserve() => efi_arch_mem_reserve() *after* mm_init() has been called.

Indeed, KASAN reports a bad read access later on in efi_free_boot_services():

  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in efi_free_boot_services+0xae/0x24c

The instruction at the given address is the first read from the memmap's
memory, i.e. the read of md->type in efi_free_boot_services().

Note that the writes earlier in efi_arch_mem_reserve() don't splat because
they're done through early_memremap()ed addresses.

So, after memblock is gone, allocations should be done through the "normal"
page allocator. Introduce a helper, efi_memmap_alloc() for this. Use
it from efi_arch_mem_reserve(), efi_free_boot_services() and, for the sake
of consistency, from efi_fake_memmap() as well.

Note that for the latter, the memmap allocations cease to be page aligned.
This isn't needed though.
