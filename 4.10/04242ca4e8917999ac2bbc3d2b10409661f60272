spi: atmel: Use SPI core DMA mapping framework

Use the SPI core DMA mapping framework instead of our own
in case of DMA support. PDC support is not converted to this
framework.

The driver is now able to transfer a complete sg list through DMA.
This eventually fix an issue with vmalloc'ed DMA memory that is
provided for example by UBI/UBIFS layers.
