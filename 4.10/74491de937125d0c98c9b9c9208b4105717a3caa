net/mlx5: Add multi dest support

Currently when calling mlx5_add_flow_rule we accept
only one flow destination, this commit allows to pass
multiple destinations.

This change forces us to change the return structure to a more
flexible one. We introduce a flow handle (struct mlx5_flow_handle),
it holds internally the number for rules created and holds an array
where each cell points the to a flow rule.

From the consumers (of mlx5_add_flow_rule) point of view this
change is only cosmetic and requires only to change the type
of the returned value they store.

From the core point of view, we now need to use a loop when
allocating and deleting rules (e.g given to us a flow handler).
