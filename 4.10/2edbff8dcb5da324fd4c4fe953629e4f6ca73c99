qed: Learn resources from management firmware

Currently, each interfaces assumes it receives an equal portion
of HW/FW resources, but this is wasteful - different partitions
[and specifically, parititions exposing different protocol support]
might require different resources.

Implement a new resource learning scheme where the information is
received directly from the management firmware [which has knowledge
of all of the functions and can serve as arbiter].
