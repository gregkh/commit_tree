tipc: create TIPC_DISCONNECTING as a new sk_state

In this commit, we create a new tipc socket state TIPC_DISCONNECTING in
sk_state. TIPC_DISCONNECTING is replacing the socket connection status
update using SS_DISCONNECTING.
TIPC_DISCONNECTING is set for connection oriented sockets at:
- tipc_shutdown()
- connection probe timeout
- when we receive an error message on the connection.

There is no functional change in this commit.
