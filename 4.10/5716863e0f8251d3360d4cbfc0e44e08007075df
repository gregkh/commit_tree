fsnotify: Fix possible use-after-free in inode iteration on umount

fsnotify_unmount_inodes() plays complex tricks to pin next inode in the
sb->s_inodes list when iterating over all inodes. Furthermore the code has a
bug that if the current inode is the last on i_sb_list that does not have e.g.
I_FREEING set, then we leave next_i pointing to inode which may get removed
from the i_sb_list once we drop s_inode_list_lock thus resulting in
use-after-free issues (usually manifesting as infinite looping in
fsnotify_unmount_inodes()).

Fix the problem by keeping current inode pinned somewhat longer. Then we can
make the code much simpler and standard.
