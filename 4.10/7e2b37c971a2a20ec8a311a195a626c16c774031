kbuild: kallsyms allow 3-pass generation if symbols size has changed

kallsyms generation is not foolproof, due to some linkers adding
symbols (e.g., branch trampolines) when a binary size changes.
Have it attempt a 3rd pass automatically if the kallsyms size changes
in the 2nd pass.

This allows powerpc64 allyesconfig to build without adding another
pass when it's not required.

This can be solved other ways by directing the linker not to add labels
on branch stubs, or to move kallsyms near the end of the image. The
former is undesirable for debugging/tracing, and the latter is a more
significant change that requires more testing and review.
