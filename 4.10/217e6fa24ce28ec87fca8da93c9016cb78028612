net: introduce device min_header_len

The stack must not pass packets to device drivers that are shorter
than the minimum link layer header length.

Previously, packet sockets would drop packets smaller than or equal
to dev->hard_header_len, but this has false positives. Zero length
payload is used over Ethernet. Other link layer protocols support
variable length headers. Support for validation of these protocols
removed the min length check for all protocols.

Introduce an explicit dev->min_header_len parameter and drop all
packets below this value. Initially, set it to non-zero only for
Ethernet and loopback. Other protocols can follow in a patch to
net-next.
