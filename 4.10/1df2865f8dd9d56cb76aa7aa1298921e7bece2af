fpga-mgr: add fpga image information struct

This patch adds a minor change in the FPGA Manager API
to hold information that is specific to an FPGA image
file.  This change is expected to bring little, if any,
pain.  The socfpga and zynq drivers are fixed up in
this patch.

An FPGA image file will have particulars that affect how the
image is programmed to the FPGA.  One example is that
current 'flags' currently has one bit which shows whether the
FPGA image was built for full reconfiguration or partial
reconfiguration.  Another example is timeout values for
enabling or disabling the bridges in the FPGA.  As the
complexity of the FPGA design increases, the bridges in the
FPGA may take longer times to enable or disable.

This patch adds a new 'struct fpga_image_info', moves the
current 'u32 flags' to it.  Two other image-specific u32's
are added for the bridge enable/disable timeouts.  The FPGA
Manager API functions are changed, replacing the 'u32 flag'
parameter with a pointer to struct fpga_image_info.
Subsequent patches fix the existing low level FPGA manager
drivers.
