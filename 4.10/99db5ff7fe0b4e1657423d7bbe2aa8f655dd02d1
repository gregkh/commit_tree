ACPI / property: Hierarchical properties support update

The definition document of the Hierarchical Properties Extension UUID
for _DSD has been changed recently to allow local references to be
used as sub-node link targets (previously, it only allowed strings to
be used for that purpose).

Update the code in drivers/acpi/property.c to reflect that change.
