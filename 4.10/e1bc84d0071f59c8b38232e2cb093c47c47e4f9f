HID: sony: Fix race condition in sony_probe

Early on the sony_probe function calls hid_hw_start to start the hardware.
Afterwards it issues some hardware requests, initializes other functionality
like Force Feedback, power classes and others. However by the time
hid_hw_start returns, the device nodes have already been created, which leads
to a race condition by user space applications which may detect the device
prior to completion of initialization. We have observed this problem many
times, this patch fixes the problem.

This patch moves most of sony_probe to sony_input_configured, which is called
prior to device registration. This fixes the race condition and the same
approach is used in other HID drivers.
