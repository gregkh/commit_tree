drm/nouveau/iccsense: Parse the resistors and config the right way

Previously we parsed that table a bit wrong:
1. The entry layout depends on the sensor type used.
2. We have all resitors in one entry for the INA3221.
3. The config is already included in the vbios.

This commit addresses that issue and with that we should be able to read
out the right power consumption for every GPU with a INA209, INA219 and
INA3221.
