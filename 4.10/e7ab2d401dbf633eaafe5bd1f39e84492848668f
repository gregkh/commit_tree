scsi: cxlflash: Remove unused buffer from AFU command

The cxlflash driver originally required a per-command 4K buffer that
hosted data passed to the AFU. When the routines that initiate AFU
and internal SCSI commands were refactored to use scsi_execute(), the
need for this buffer became obsolete. As it is no longer necessary,
the buffer is removed.
