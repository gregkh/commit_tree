s390/dasd: Make setting queue_max_segments more explicit

Currently the block queue value max_segments is set to -1L, which
is then implicitly casted to unsigned short in blk_queue_max_segments.
This results in 65535 (64k) max_segments.

Even though the resulting value is correct, setting it implicitly using
-1L is rather confusing. Set the value explicitly using the USHRT_MAX
macro instead.
