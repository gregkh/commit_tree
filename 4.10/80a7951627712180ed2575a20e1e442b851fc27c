mm: fix up get_user_pages* comments

In the previous round of get_user_pages* changes comments attached to
__get_user_pages_unlocked() and get_user_pages_unlocked() were rendered
incorrect, this patch corrects them.

In addition the get_user_pages_unlocked() comment seems to have already
been outdated as it referred to tsk, mm parameters which were removed in
c12d2da5 ("mm/gup: Remove the macro overload API migration helpers from
the get_user*() APIs"), this patch fixes this also.
