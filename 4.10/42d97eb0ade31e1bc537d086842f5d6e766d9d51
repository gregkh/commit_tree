fscrypt: fix renaming and linking special files

Attempting to link a device node, named pipe, or socket file into an
encrypted directory through rename(2) or link(2) always failed with
EPERM.  This happened because fscrypt_has_permitted_context() saw that
the file was unencrypted and forbid creating the link.  This behavior
was unexpected because such files are never encrypted; only regular
files, directories, and symlinks can be encrypted.

To fix this, make fscrypt_has_permitted_context() always return true on
special files.

This will be covered by a test in my encryption xfstests patchset.
