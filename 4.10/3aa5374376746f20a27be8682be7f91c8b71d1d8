devfreq_cooling: pass a pointer to devfreq in the power model callbacks

When the devfreq cooling device was designed, it was an oversight not to
pass a pointer to the struct devfreq as the first parameters of the
callbacks.  The design patterns of the kernel suggest it for a good
reason.

By passing a pointer to struct devfreq, the driver can register one
function that works with multiple devices.  With the current
implementation, a driver that can work with multiple devices has to
create multiple copies of the same function with different parameters so
that each devfreq_cooling_device can use the appropriate one.  By
passing a pointer to struct devfreq, the driver can identify which
device it's referring to.
