powerpc/64: Used named initialisers for ibm_pa_features

The ibm_pa_features array consists of structures that describe which bit
and byte in the ibm,pa-features property toggles one or more flags in
either the CPU, MMU, or user visible feature flags.

Each one consists of 7 values, which are all unsigned long, int or char,
meaning the compiler gives us no warning if we assign the wrong values
to the wrong elements. In fact we have had a bug here in the past, where
we were setting incorrect bits, see commit 6997e57d693b ("powerpc:
scan_features() updates incorrect bits for REAL_LE").

So switch to using named initialisers for the structure elements, to
reduce the likelihood of future bugs, and hopefully improve readability
also.
