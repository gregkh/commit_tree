avoid spurious "may be used uninitialized" warning

The timer type simplifications caused a new gcc warning:

  drivers/base/power/domain.c: In function ‘genpd_runtime_suspend’:
  drivers/base/power/domain.c:562:14: warning: ‘time_start’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
     elapsed_ns = ktime_to_ns(ktime_sub(ktime_get(), time_start));

despite the actual use of "time_start" not having changed in any way.
It appears that simply changing the type of ktime_t from a union to a
plain scalar type made gcc check the use.

The variable wasn't actually used uninitialized, but gcc apparently
failed to notice that the conditional around the use was exactly the
same as the conditional around the initialization of that variable.

Add an unnecessary initialization just to shut up the compiler.
