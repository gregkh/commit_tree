perf intel-pt/bts: Report instruction bytes and length in sample

Change Intel PT and BTS to pass up the length and the instruction
bytes of the decoded or sampled instruction in the perf sample.

The decoder already knows this information, we just need to pass it
up. Since it is only a couple of movs it is not very expensive.

Handle instruction cache too. Make sure ilen is always initialized.

Used in the next patch.

[Adrian: re-base on top (and adjust for) instruction buffer size tidy-up]
[Adrian: add BTS support and adjust commit message accordingly]
