arm64: KVM: pmu: Reset PMSELR_EL0.SEL to a sane value before entering the guest

The ARMv8 architecture allows the cycle counter to be configured
by setting PMSELR_EL0.SEL==0x1f and then accessing PMXEVTYPER_EL0,
hence accessing PMCCFILTR_EL0. But it disallows the use of
PMSELR_EL0.SEL==0x1f to access the cycle counter itself through
PMXEVCNTR_EL0.

Linux itself doesn't violate this rule, but we may end up with
PMSELR_EL0.SEL being set to 0x1f when we enter a guest. If that
guest accesses PMXEVCNTR_EL0, the access may UNDEF at EL1,
despite the guest not having done anything wrong.

In order to avoid this unfortunate course of events (haha!), let's
sanitize PMSELR_EL0 on guest entry. This ensures that the guest
won't explode unexpectedly.
