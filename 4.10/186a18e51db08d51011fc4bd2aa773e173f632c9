scsi: mpt3sas: set EEDP-escape-flags for SAS35 devices.

An UNMAP command on a PI formatted device will leave the Logical Block
Application Tag and Logical Block Reference Tag as all F's (for those LBAs
that are unmapped). To avoid IO errors if those LBAs are subsequently read
before they are written with valid tag fields, the MPI SCSI IO requests
need to set the EEDPFlags element EEDP Escape Mode field, Bits [7:6]
appropriately. A value of 2 should be set to disable all PI checks if the
Logical Block Application Tag is 0xFFFF for PI types 1 and 2.  A value
of 3 should be set to disable all PI checks if the Logical Block
Application Tag is 0xFFFF and the Logical Block Reference Tag is
0xFFFFFFFF for PI type 3.
