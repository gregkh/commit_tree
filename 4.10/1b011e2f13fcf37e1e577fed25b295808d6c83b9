ratelimit: fix WARN_ON_RATELIMIT return value

The macro is to be used similarly as WARN_ON as:

  if (WARN_ON_RATELIMIT(condition, state))
	do_something();

One would expect only 'condition' to affect the 'if', but
WARN_ON_RATELIMIT does internally only:

  WARN_ON((condition) && __ratelimit(state))

So the 'if' is affected by the ratelimiting state too.  Fix this by
returning 'condition' in any case.

Note that nobody uses WARN_ON_RATELIMIT yet, so there is nothing to
worry about.  But I was about to use it and was a bit surprised.
