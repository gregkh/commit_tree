virtio-net: Update the mtu code to match virtio spec

The virtio committee recently ratified a change, VIRTIO-152, which
defines the mtu field to be 'max' MTU, not simply desired MTU.

This commit brings the virtio-net device in compliance with VIRTIO-152.

Additionally, drop the max_mtu branch - it cannot be taken since the u16
returned by virtio_cread16 will never exceed the initial value of
max_mtu.
