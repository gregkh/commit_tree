block: split out request-only flags into a new namespace

A lot of the REQ_* flags are only used on struct requests, and only of
use to the block layer and a few drivers that dig into struct request
internals.

This patch adds a new req_flags_t rq_flags field to struct request for
them, and thus dramatically shrinks the number of common requests.  It
also removes the unfortunate situation where we have to fit the fields
from the same enum into 32 bits for struct bio and 64 bits for
struct request.
