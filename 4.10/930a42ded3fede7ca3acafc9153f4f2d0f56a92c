vfio/spapr_tce: Set window when adding additional groups to container

If a container already has a group attached, attaching a new group
should just program already created IOMMU tables to the hardware via
the iommu_table_group_ops::set_window() callback.

However commit 6f01cc692a16 ("vfio/spapr: Add a helper to create
default DMA window") did not just simplify the code but also removed
the set_window() calls in the case of attaching groups to a container
which already has tables so it broke VFIO PCI hotplug.

This reverts set_window() bits in tce_iommu_take_ownership_ddw().
