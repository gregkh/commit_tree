net: cris: make eth_v10.c explicitly non-modular

The Makefile/Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/net/cris/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_ETRAX_ARCH_V10) += eth_v10.o

arch/cris/Kconfig:config ETRAX_ARCH_V10
arch/cris/Kconfig:       bool

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

There was a one line wrapper for the int init function, which made no
sense; hence we just put the device_initcall on the true init function
itself and delete the pointless wrapper.  In doing that we get rid of
the following compile warning:

   WARNING: drivers/net/built-in.o(.text+0x1e28): Section mismatch in
   reference from the function etrax_init_module() to the function
   .init.text:etrax_ethernet_init()

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
