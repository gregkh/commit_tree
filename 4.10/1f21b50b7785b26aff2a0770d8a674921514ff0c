rcu: Remove obsolete comment from __call_rcu()

The __call_rcu() comment about opportunistically noting grace period
beginnings and endings is obsolete.  RCU still does such opportunistic
noting, but in __call_rcu_core() rather than __call_rcu(), and there
already is an appropriate comment in __call_rcu_core().  This commit
therefore removes the obsolete comment.
