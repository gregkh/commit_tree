tipc: fix connection refcount error

Until now, the generic server framework maintains the connection
id's per subscriber in server's conn_idr. At tipc_close_conn, we
remove the connection id from the server list, but the connection is
valid until we call the refcount cleanup. Hence we have a window
where the server allocates the same connection to an new subscriber
leading to inconsistent reference count. We have another refcount
warning we grab the refcount in tipc_conn_lookup() for connections
with flag with CF_CONNECTED not set. This usually occurs at shutdown
when the we stop the topology server and withdraw TIPC_CFG_SRV
publication thereby triggering a withdraw message to subscribers.

In this commit, we:
1. remove the connection from the server list at recount cleanup.
2. grab the refcount for a connection only if CF_CONNECTED is set.
