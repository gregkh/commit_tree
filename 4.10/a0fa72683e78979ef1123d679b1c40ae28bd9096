IB/rxe: avoid putting a large struct rxe_qp on stack

A race condition fix added an rxe_qp structure to the stack in order
to be able to perform rollback in rxe_requester(), but the structure
is large enough to trigger the warning for possible stack overflow:

drivers/infiniband/sw/rxe/rxe_req.c: In function 'rxe_requester':
drivers/infiniband/sw/rxe/rxe_req.c:757:1: error: the frame size of 2064 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

This changes the rollback function to only save the psn inside
the qp, which is the only field we access in the rollback_qp
anyway.
