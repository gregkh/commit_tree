net: stmmac: dwmac-oxnas: fix fixed-link-phydev leaks

Make sure to deregister and free any fixed-link phy registered during
probe on probe errors and on driver unbind by calling the new glue
helper function.

For driver unbind, use the generic stmmac-platform remove implementation
and add an exit callback to disable the clock.
