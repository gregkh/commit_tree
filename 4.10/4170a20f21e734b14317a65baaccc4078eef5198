drivers/pcmcia/m32r_pcc.c: check return from request_irq

While building m32r allmodconfig we were getting warning:

  drivers/pcmcia/m32r_pcc.c:331:2: warning: ignoring return value of 'request_irq', declared with attribute warn_unused_result

request_irq() can fail and we should always be checking the result from
it. Check the result and return it to the caller.
