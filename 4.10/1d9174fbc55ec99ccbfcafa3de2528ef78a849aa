PM / Runtime: Defer resuming of the device in pm_runtime_force_resume()

When the pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() helpers were invented, we still
had CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME and CONFIG_PM_SLEEP as separate Kconfig options.

To make sure these helpers worked for all combinations and without
introducing too much of complexity, the device was always resumed in
pm_runtime_force_resume().

More precisely, when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP was set and CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME was
unset, we needed to resume the device as the subsystem/driver couldn't
rely on using runtime PM to do it.

As the CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME option was merged into CONFIG_PM a while ago, it
removed this combination, of using CONFIG_PM_SLEEP without the earlier
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME.

For this reason we can now rely on the subsystem/driver to use runtime PM
to resume the device, instead of forcing that to be done in all cases. In
other words, let's defer the runtime resume to a later point when it's
actually needed.
