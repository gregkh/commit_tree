Revert "net: stmmac: allow to split suspend/resume from init/exit callbacks"

Instead of adding hooks inside stmmac_platform it is better to just use
the standard PM callbacks within the specific dwmac-driver. This only
used by the dwmac-rk driver.

This reverts commit cecbc5563a02 ("stmmac: allow to split suspend/resume
from init/exit callbacks").
