cpufreq: intel_pstate: Use locking in intel_cpufreq_verify_policy()

Race conditions are possible if intel_cpufreq_verify_policy()
is executed in parallel with global limits updates from sysfs,
so the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() in it
should be carried out under intel_pstate_limits_lock.

Make that happen.
