net/mlx5: Use fte status to decide on firmware command

An fte status becomes FS_FTE_STATUS_EXISTING only after it was
created in HW. We can use this in order to simplify the logic on
what firmware command to use. If the status isn't FS_FTE_STATUS_EXISTING
we need to create the fte, otherwise we need only to update it.
