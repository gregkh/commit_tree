s390/dasd: Eliminate race condition in dasd_generic_set_offline()

Before we set a device offline, the open_count for the block device is
checked and certain flags are checked and set as well.
However, this is all done without holding any lock. Potentially, if the
open_count was checked but the DASD_FLAG_OFFLINE wasn't set yet, a
different process might want to increase the open_count depending on
whether DASD_FLAG_OFFLINE is set or not in the meanwhile.

This is quite racy and can lead to the loss of the device for that
process and subsequently lead to a panic.

Fix this by checking the open_count and setting the offline flags while
holding the ccwdev lock.
