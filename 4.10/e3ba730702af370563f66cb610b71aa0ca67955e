fsnotify: Remove fsnotify_duplicate_mark()

There are only two calls sites of fsnotify_duplicate_mark(). Those are
in kernel/audit_tree.c and both are bogus. Vfsmount pointer is unused
for audit tree, inode pointer and group gets set in
fsnotify_add_mark_locked() later anyway, mask and free_mark are already
set in alloc_chunk(). In fact, calling fsnotify_duplicate_mark() is
actively harmful because following fsnotify_add_mark_locked() will leak
group reference by overwriting the group pointer. So just remove the two
calls to fsnotify_duplicate_mark() and the function.
