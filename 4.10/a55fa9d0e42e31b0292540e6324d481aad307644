i2c: imx-lpi2c: add low power i2c bus driver

This patch adds lpi2c bus driver to support new i.MX products
which use lpi2c instead of the old imx i2c.

The lpi2c can continue operating in stop mode when an appropriate
clock is available. It is also designed for low CPU overhead with
DMA offloading of FIFO register accesses.
