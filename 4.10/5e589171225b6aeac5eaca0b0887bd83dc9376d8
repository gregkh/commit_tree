i40iw: Remove macros I40IW_STAG_KEY_FROM_STAG and I40IW_STAG_INDEX_FROM_STAG

The macros I40IW_STAG_KEY_FROM_STAG and I40IW_STAG_INDEX_FROM_STAG are
apparently bad - they are using the logical "&&" operation which
does not make sense here. It should have been a bitwise "&" instead.
Since the macros seem to be completely unused, let's simply remove
them so that nobody accidentially uses them in the future. And while
we're at it, also remove the unused macro I40IW_CREATE_STAG.
