nbd: use loff_t for blocksize and nbd_set_size args

If we have large devices (say like the 40t drive I was trying to test with) we
will end up overflowing the int arguments to nbd_set_size and not get the right
size for our device.  Fix this by using loff_t everywhere so I don't have to
think about this again.  Thanks,
