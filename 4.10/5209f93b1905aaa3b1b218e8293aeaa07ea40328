staging: vc04_services: fix array_size.cocci warnings

drivers/staging/vc04_services/interface/vchiq_arm/vchiq_arm.c:193:39-40: WARNING: Use ARRAY_SIZE

 Use ARRAY_SIZE instead of dividing sizeof array with sizeof an element

Semantic patch information:
 This makes an effort to find cases where ARRAY_SIZE can be used such as
 where there is a division of sizeof the array by the sizeof its first
 element or by any indexed element or the element type. It replaces the
 division of the two sizeofs by ARRAY_SIZE.
