bnxt_en: Refactor the driver registration function with firmware.

The driver register function with firmware consists of passing version
information and registering for async events.  To support the RDMA driver,
the async events that we need to register may change.  Separate the
driver register function into 2 parts so that we can just update the
async events for the RDMA driver.
