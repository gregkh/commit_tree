radix tree test suite: allow GFP_ATOMIC allocations to fail

In order to test the preload code, it is necessary to fail GFP_ATOMIC
allocations, which requires defining GFP_KERNEL and GFP_ATOMIC properly.
Remove the obsolete __GFP_WAIT and copy the definitions of the __GFP
flags which are used from the kernel include files.  We also need the
real definition of gfpflags_allow_blocking() to persuade the radix tree
to actually use its preallocated nodes.
