net: dsa: Do not destroy invalid network devices

dsa_slave_create() can fail, and dsa_user_port_unapply() will properly check
for the network device not being NULL before attempting to destroy it. We were
not setting the slave network device as NULL if dsa_slave_create() failed, so
we would later on be calling dsa_slave_destroy() on a now free'd and
unitialized network device, causing crashes in dsa_slave_destroy().
