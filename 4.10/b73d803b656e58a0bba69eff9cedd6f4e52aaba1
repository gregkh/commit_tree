staging: lustre: lnet: add offset for selftest brw

In current lnet selftest, both client and server side bulk have
no offset and we can only test page aligned IO, this patch changed
this:

- user can set brw offset by lst add_test ... brw off=OFFSET ...
- offset is only effective on client side so far
- to simply implementation, offset needs to be eight bytes aligned
