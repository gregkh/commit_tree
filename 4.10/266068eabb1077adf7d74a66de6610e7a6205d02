KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v2: Limit ITARGETSR bits to number of VCPUs

The GICv2 spec says in section 4.3.12 that a "CPU targets field bit that
corresponds to an unimplemented CPU interface is RAZ/WI."
Currently we allow the guest to write any value in there and it can
read that back.
Mask the written value with the proper CPU mask to be spec compliant.
