[media] videodev2.h Add HSV formats

These formats store the color information of the image
in a geometrical representation. The colors are mapped into a
cylinder, where the angle is the HUE, the height is the VALUE
and the distance to the center is the SATURATION. This is a very
useful format for image segmentation algorithms.
