pstore: Protect unlink with read_mutex

When update_ms is set, pstore_get_records() will be called when there's
a new entry.  But unlink can be called at the same time and might
contend with the open-read-close loop.  Depending on the implementation
of platform driver, it may be safe or not.  But I think it'd be better
to protect those race in the first place.
