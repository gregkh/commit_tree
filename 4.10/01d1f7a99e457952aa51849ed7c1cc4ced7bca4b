iio: bmi160: Fix time needed to sleep after command execution

Datasheet specifies typical and maximum execution times for which CMD
register is occupied after previous command execution. We took these
values as minimum and maximum time for usleep_range() call before making
a new command execution.

To be sure, that the CMD register is no longer occupied we need to wait
*at least* the maximum time specified by datasheet.
