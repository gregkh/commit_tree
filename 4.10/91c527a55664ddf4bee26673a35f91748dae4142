ethernet/intel: use core min/max MTU checking

e100: min_mtu 68, max_mtu 1500
- remove e100_change_mtu entirely, is identical to old eth_change_mtu,
  and no longer serves a purpose. No need to set min_mtu or max_mtu
  explicitly, as ether_setup() will already set them to 68 and 1500.

e1000: min_mtu 46, max_mtu 16110

e1000e: min_mtu 68, max_mtu varies based on adapter

fm10k: min_mtu 68, max_mtu 15342
- remove fm10k_change_mtu entirely, does nothing now

i40e: min_mtu 68, max_mtu 9706

i40evf: min_mtu 68, max_mtu 9706

igb: min_mtu 68, max_mtu 9216
- There are two different "max" frame sizes claimed and both checked in
  the driver, the larger value wasn't relevant though, so I've set max_mtu
  to the smaller of the two values here to retain identical behavior.

igbvf: min_mtu 68, max_mtu 9216
- Same issue as igb duplicated

ixgb: min_mtu 68, max_mtu 16114
- Also remove pointless old == new check, as that's done in dev_set_mtu

ixgbe: min_mtu 68, max_mtu 9710

ixgbevf: min_mtu 68, max_mtu dependent on hardware/firmware
- Some hw can only handle up to max_mtu 1504 on a vf, others 9710
