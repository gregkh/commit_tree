perf/x86/intel/uncore: Make package handling more robust

The package management code in uncore relies on package mapping being
available before a CPU is started. This changed with:

  9d85eb9119f4 ("x86/smpboot: Make logical package management more robust")

because the ACPI/BIOS information turned out to be unreliable, but that
left uncore in broken state. This was not noticed because on a regular boot
all CPUs are online before uncore is initialized.

Move the allocation to the CPU online callback and simplify the hotplug
handling. At this point the package mapping is established and correct.
