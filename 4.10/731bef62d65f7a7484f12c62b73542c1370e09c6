staging/lustre: conflicting PW & PR extent locks on a client

PW lock isn't replayed once a lock is marked
LDLM_FL_CANCELING and glimpse lock doesn't wait for
conflicting locks on the client. So the server will
grant a PR lock in response to the glimpse lock request,
which conflicts with the PW lock in LDLM_FL_CANCELING
state on the client.

Lock in LDLM_FL_CANCELING state may still have pending IO,
so it should be replayed until LDLM_FL_BL_DONE is set to
avoid granted conflicting lock by a server.
