IB/mlx5: Avoid system crash when enabling many VFs

When enabling many VFs, the total amount of DMA mappings increase
significantly. This causes DMA allocations to take a lot of time
since they are serialized in the kernel.

As a result the driver enters into fatal condition due to
timeout and the system hangs. To recover from this we disable
MR cache for VFs.

PFs will still have a full cache and VFs cache can be manipulated
as usual after driver load.
