arm64: fix error: conflicting types for 'kprobe_fault_handler'

When CONFIG_KPROBE is disabled but CONFIG_UPROBE_EVENT is enabled, we get
following compilation error:

<asm/kprobes.h> is already included from <linux/kprobes.h> under #ifdef
CONFIG_KPROBE. So, this patch fixes the error by removing it from
decode-insn.c.
