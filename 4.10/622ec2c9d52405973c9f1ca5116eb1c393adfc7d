net: core: add UID to flows, rules, and routes

- Define a new FIB rule attributes, FRA_UID_RANGE, to describe a
  range of UIDs.
- Define a RTA_UID attribute for per-UID route lookups and dumps.
- Support passing these attributes to and from userspace via
  rtnetlink. The value INVALID_UID indicates no UID was
  specified.
- Add a UID field to the flow structures.
