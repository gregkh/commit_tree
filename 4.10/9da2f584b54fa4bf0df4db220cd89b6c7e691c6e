kbuild: improve linker compatibility with lib-ksyms.o build

lib-ksyms.o is created by linking an empty input file with a linker
script containing the interesting bits. Currently the empty input file
is an archive containing nothing, however this causes the gold linker
to segfault.

I have opened a bug against gold

  https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20767

However this can be worked around by assembling an empty file to link
with instead. The resulting lib-ksyms.o is slightly larger (seemingly
due to empty .text, .data, .bss setions added), but final linked
output should not be changed.
