s390: char: make zcore explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/s390/Kconfig:config CRASH_DUMP
arch/s390/Kconfig:      bool "kernel crash dumps"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init wasn't even being used by this file, the init
ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
