ipv6: Handle IPv4-mapped src to in6addr_any dst.

This patch adds a check on the type of the source address for the case
where the destination address is in6addr_any. If the source is an
IPv4-mapped IPv6 source address, the destination is changed to
::ffff:127.0.0.1, and otherwise the destination is changed to ::1. This
is done in three locations to handle UDP calls to either connect() or
sendmsg() and TCP calls to connect(). Note that udpv6_sendmsg() delays
handling an in6addr_any destination until very late, so the patch only
needs to handle the case where the source is an IPv4-mapped IPv6
address.
