drm/amdgpu:properly fix some JumpTable issues

we found some MEC ucode leads to IB test fail or even
ring test fail if Jump Table of it is not start in
FW bo with page aligned address, fixed by always make
JT address page aligned.

we don't need to patch JT2 for MEC2, because for VI,
MEC2 is a copy of MEC1, thus when converting fw_type
for MEC_JT2 we just return MEC1,hw can use the same
JT for both MEC1 & MEC2.

above two change fixed some ring/ib test failure issue
for some version of MEC ucode.
