regulator: fixed: Revert support for ACPI interface

This reverts commit 13bed58ce874 (regulator: fixed: add support for ACPI
interface).

While there does appear to be a practical need to manage regulators on ACPI
systems, using ad-hoc properties to describe regulators to the kernel presents
a number of problems (especially should ACPI gain first class support for such
things), and there are ongoing discussions as to how to manage this.

Until there is a rough consensus, revert commit 13bed58ce8748d43, which hasn't
been in a released kernel yet as discussed in [1] and the surrounding thread.
