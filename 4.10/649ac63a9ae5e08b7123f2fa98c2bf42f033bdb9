i2c: mux: mlxcpld: fix i2c mux selection caching

smbus functions return -ve on error, 0 on success.  However,
__i2c_transfer() have a different return signature - -ve on error, or
number of buffers transferred (which may be zero or greater).

The upshot of this is that the sense of the test is reversed when using
the mux on a bus supporting the master_xfer method: we cache the value
and never retry if we fail to transfer any buffers, but if we succeed,
we clear the cached value.

Fix this by making mlxcpld_mux_reg_write() return a -ve error code for
all failure cases, just as was done in commit 7f638c1cb0a1 ("i2c: mux:
pca954x: fix i2c mux selection caching").

This also aligns the implementations of these two muxes in this area.
