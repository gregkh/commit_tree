xfs: don't allow di_size with high bit set

The on-disk field di_size is used to set i_size, which is a signed
integer of loff_t.  If the high bit of di_size is set, we'll end up with
a negative i_size, which will cause all sorts of problems.  Since the
VFS won't let us create a file with such length, we should catch them
here in the verifier too.
