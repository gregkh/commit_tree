i40e: Pass unknown PHY type for unknown PHYs

The PHY type value for unrecognized PHYs and cables was changed
based on firmware version number. Newer hardware use lower firmware
version numbers and this was causing some PHYs to be identified
as type 0x16 instead of 0xe (unknown).

Without this patch, newer card will incorrectly identify unknown
PHYs and cables.

This change adds hardware type to the check for firmware version
so the PHY type is reported correctly.
