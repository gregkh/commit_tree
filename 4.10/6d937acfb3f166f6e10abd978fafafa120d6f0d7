qed: Optimize qed_chain datapath usage

The chain structure and functions are widely used by the qed* modules,
both for configuration and datapath.
E.g., qede's Tx has one such chain and its Rx has two.

Currently, the strucutre's fields which are required for datapath
related functions [produce/consume] are intertwined with fields which
are required only for configuration purposes [init/destroy/etc.].

This patch re-arranges the chain structure so that all the fields which
are required for datapath usage could reside in a single cacheline instead
of the two which are required today.
