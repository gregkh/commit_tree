btrfs: change btrfs_csum_final result param type to u8

csum member of struct btrfs_super_block has array type of u8. It makes
sense that function btrfs_csum_final should be also declared to accept
u8 *. I changed the declaration of method void btrfs_csum_final(u32 crc,
char *result); to void btrfs_csum_final(u32 crc, u8 *result);
