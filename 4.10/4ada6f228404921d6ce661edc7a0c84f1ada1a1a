drm: document standard connector properties

There's a really big pile of additional connector properties, a lot of
them standardized. But they're all for specific outputs (panels, TV,
scaling, ...) so I left them out for now since this is enough for a
start.

I typed this to give Manasi a place to add her new link status
property documentation.

v2: forgot to git add all the bits (Manasi).

v3: Be more epxlicit about integrated tiled panels (Archit)
