ASoC: simple-scu-card: code sync: follow to simple family style

simple sound card family are using very similar style, but because of its
historical reason, there are small differences. For example pointer style,
function name, caller postion etc...
This patch synchronized simple card style to other simple card family

Current simple-scu-card function naming is different from other simple card
family. And related to it, the necessary operation position is also
different. This patch synchronize these to other simple card family.
