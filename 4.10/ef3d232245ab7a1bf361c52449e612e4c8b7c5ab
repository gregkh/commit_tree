mmc: mmc: Relax checking for switch errors after HS200 switch

The JEDEC specification indicates CMD13 can be used after a HS200 switch
to check for errors. However in practice some boards experience CRC errors
in the CMD13 response. Consequently, for HS200, CRC errors are not a
reliable way to know the switch failed. If there really is a problem, we
would expect tuning will fail and the result ends up the same. So change
the error condition to ignore CRC errors in that case.
