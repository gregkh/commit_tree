arm/arm64: xen: Move shared architecture headers to include/xen/arm

ARM and arm64 Xen ports share a number of headers, leading to
packaging issues when these headers needs to be exported, as it
breaks the reasonable requirement that an architecture port
has self-contained headers.

Fix the issue by moving the 5 header files to include/xen/arm,
and keep local placeholders to include the relevant files.
