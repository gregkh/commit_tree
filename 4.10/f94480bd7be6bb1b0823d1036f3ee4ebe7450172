Btrfs: abort transaction if fill_holes() fails

At this point we will have dropped extent entries from the file, so if we fail
to insert the new hole entries then we are leaving the fs in a corrupt state
(albeit an easily fixed one).  Abort the transaciton if this happens so we can
avoid corrupting the fs.  Thanks,
