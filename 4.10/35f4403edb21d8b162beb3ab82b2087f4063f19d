ASoC: arizona: Use component pin control functions

We need to modify the state of some of our own pins and are currently
not taking account that the pin name may have a name_prefix applied
to it.

Replace the snd_soc_dapm_x_pin functions with the equivalent
snd_soc_component_x_pin functions so that any name_prefix will be
handled automatically.
