target: Minimize #include directives

Remove superfluous #include directives from the include/target/*.h
files. Add missing #include directives to other *.h and *.c files.
Use forward declarations for structures where possible. This
change reduces the build time for make M=drivers/target on my
laptop from 27.1s to 18.7s or by about 30%.
