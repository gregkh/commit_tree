f2fs: fix to access nullified flush_cmd_control pointer

f2fs_sync_file()             remount_ro
 - f2fs_readonly
                               - destroy_flush_cmd_control
 - f2fs_issue_flush
   - no fcc pointer!

So, this patch doesn't free fcc in this case, but just stop its kernel thread
which sends flush commands.
