scsi: ufs: handle errors from PHY_ADAPTER_ERROR register

The PHY_ADAPTER_ERROR status register indicates PHY lane errors
reported by the M-PHY layer. In some occasions the controller
can recover from such errors. When the error is not recoverable,
a stuck DB error will occur. Since the stuck DB error is spotted
separately, no action other than clearing the register is necessary.
