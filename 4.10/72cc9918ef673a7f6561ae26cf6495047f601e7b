s390: delete unneeded #include <linux/kconfig.h> from facilities_src.h

The header facilities_src.h is only included from gen_facilities.c
and the tool is compiled with the following extra options:

    HOSTCFLAGS_gen_facilities.o += -Wall $(LINUXINCLUDE)

Please note $(LINUXINCLUDE) is expanded into build options including:

    -include $(srctree)/include/linux/kconfig.h

So, the Makefile always forces the tool to include kconfig.h, i.e.,
the #include <linux/kconfig.h> directive in the header is redundant.
