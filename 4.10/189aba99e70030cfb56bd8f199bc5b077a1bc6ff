IB/uverbs: Extend modify_qp and support packet pacing

An new uverbs command ib_uverbs_ex_modify_qp is added to support more QP
attributes. User driver should choose to call the legacy/extended API
based on input mask.

IB_USER_LAST_QP_ATTR_MASK is added to indicated the maximum bit position
which supports legacy ib_uverbs_modify_qp.
IB_USER_LEGACY_LAST_QP_ATTR_MASK indicates the maximum bit position
which supports ib_uverbs_ex_modify_qp, the value of this mask should be
updated if new mask is added later.

Along with this change, rate_limit is supported by the extended command,
user driver could use it to control packet packing.
