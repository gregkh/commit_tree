drm/vc4: Add support for rendering with ETC1 textures.

The validation for it ends up being quite simple, but I hadn't got
around to it before merging the driver.  For backwards compatibility,
we also need to add a flag so that the userspace GL driver can easily
tell if the kernel will allow ETC1 textures (on an old kernel, it will
continue to convert to RGBA8)
