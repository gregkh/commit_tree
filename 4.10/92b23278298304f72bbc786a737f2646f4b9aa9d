kernel/smp: Make the SMP boot message common on all arches

Currently after bringing up secondary CPUs all arches print "Brought up
%d CPUs". On x86 they also print the number of nodes that were brought
online.

It would be nice to also print the number of nodes on other arches.
Although we could override smp_announce() on the other ~10 NUMA aware
arches, it seems simpler to just always print the number of nodes. On
non-NUMA arches there is just always 1 node.

Having done that, smp_announce() is no longer weak, and seems small
enough to just pull directly into smp_init().

Also update the printing of "%d CPUs" to be smart when an SMP kernel is
booted on a single CPU system, or when only one CPU is available, eg:

   smp: Brought up 2 nodes, 1 CPU
