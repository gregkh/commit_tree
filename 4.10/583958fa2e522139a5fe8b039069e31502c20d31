ASoC: topology: Make manifest backward compatible from ABI v4

This patch adds support for old version 4 of manifest.

Topology ABI v5 added new fields to manifest while user space may still
uses v4. So kernel will check the ABI version by comparing the object
size. If user space uses v4 of manifest, kernel will create a latest
version of manifest from the old one, and use the new one internally and
free it later.
