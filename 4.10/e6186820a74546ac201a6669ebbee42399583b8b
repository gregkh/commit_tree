arm64: dts: rockchip: Arch counter doesn't tick in system suspend

The "arm,no-tick-in-suspend" property was introduced to note
implementations where the system counter does not quite follow the ARM
specification that it "must be implemented in an always-on power
domain".

Particularly, RK3399's counter stops ticking when we switch from the
24MHz clock to the 32KHz clock in low-power suspend, so let's mark it as
such.
