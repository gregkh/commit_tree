spi: dw: Set GPIO_SS flag to toggle Slave Select on GPIO CS

The Designware SPI master requires slave selection before the transfer
can begin [1].

This patch uses the new master flag to indicate both the GPIO CS and
the internal chip select should be used.

Tested On:
    Altera CycloneV development kit
    Compile tested for build errors on x86_64 (allyesconfigs)
