block: don't try to discard from __blkdev_issue_zeroout

Discard can return -EIO asynchronously if the alignment for the request
isn't suitable for the driver, which makes a proper fallback to other
methods in __blkdev_issue_zeroout impossible.  Thus only issue a sync
discard from blkdev_issue_zeroout an don't try discard at all from
__blkdev_issue_zeroout as a non-invasive workaround.

One more reason why abusing discard for zeroing must die..
