tpm: drop tpm1_chip_register(/unregister)

Check for TPM2 chip in tpm_sysfs_add_device, tpm_bios_log_setup and
tpm_bios_log_teardown in order to make code flow cleaner and to enable
to implement TPM 2.0 support later on. This is partially derived from
the commit by Nayna Jain with the extension that also tpm1_chip_register
is dropped.
