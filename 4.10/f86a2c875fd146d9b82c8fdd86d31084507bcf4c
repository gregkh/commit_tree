ARM: omap2+: am437x: rollback to use omap3_gptimer_timer_init()

The commit 55ee7017ee31 ("arm: omap2: board-generic: use
omap4_local_timer_init for AM437x") unintentionally changes the
clocksource devices for AM437x from OMAP GP Timer to SyncTimer32K.

Unfortunately, the SyncTimer32K is starving from frequency deviation
as mentioned in commit 5b5c01359152 ("ARM: OMAP2+: AM43x: Use gptimer
as clocksource") and, as reported by Franklin [1], even its monotonic
nature is under question (most probably there is a HW issue, but it's
still under investigation).

Taking into account above facts It's reasonable to rollback to the use
of omap3_gptimer_timer_init().
