scsi: cxlflash: Set sg_tablesize to 1 instead of SG_NONE

The following Oops is encountered when blk_mq is enabled with the
cxlflash driver:

The SCSI blk_mq stack assumes that sg_tablesize is always a non-zero
value with scsi_mq_setup_tags() allocating tags using sg_tablesize.
The cxlflash driver currently uses SG_NONE (0) for the sg_tablesize
as the devices it supports are not capable of scatter gather. This
mismatch of values results in the Oops above.

To resolve this issue, sg_tablesize for cxlflash can simply be set
to 1, a value which satisfies the constraints in cxlflash and the
lack of support of SG_NONE in SCSI blk_mq.
