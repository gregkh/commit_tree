perf jit: Add NT_GNU_BUILD_ID definition for older distros

Such as CentOS5, where such define is not present in elf.h.

This file, genelf.c, wasn't being built for several systems, because
it mistakenly was conditional on some DWARF features, now that it
is just needing libelf, after "perf jit: Enable jitdump support without
dwarf" it fails.

So, as preparation for "perf jit: Enable jitdump support without dwarf",
conditionally define it, if not available.
