target: bounds check XCOPY segment descriptor list

Check the length of the XCOPY request segment descriptor list against
the value advertised via the MAXIMUM SEGMENT DESCRIPTOR COUNT field in
the RECEIVE COPY OPERATING PARAMETERS response.

spc4r37 6.4.3.5 states:
  If the number of segment descriptors exceeds the allowed number, the
  copy manager shall terminate the command with CHECK CONDITION status,
  with the sense key set to ILLEGAL REQUEST, and the additional sense
  code set to TOO MANY SEGMENT DESCRIPTORS.

This functionality is testable using the libiscsi
ExtendedCopy.DescrLimits test.
