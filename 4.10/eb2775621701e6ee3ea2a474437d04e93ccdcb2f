KVM: VMX: Move skip_emulated_instruction out of nested_vmx_check_vmcs12

We can't return both the pass/fail boolean for the vmcs and the upcoming
continue/exit-to-userspace boolean for skip_emulated_instruction out of
nested_vmx_check_vmcs, so move skip_emulated_instruction out of it instead.

Additionally, VMENTER/VMRESUME only trigger singlestep exceptions when
they advance the IP to the following instruction, not when they a) succeed,
b) fail MSR validation or c) throw an exception. Add a separate call to
skip_emulated_instruction that will later not be converted to the variant
that checks the singlestep flag.
