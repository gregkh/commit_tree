kvm: x86: CPUID.01H:EDX.APIC[bit 9] should mirror IA32_APIC_BASE[11]

From the Intel SDM, volume 3, section 10.4.3, "Enabling or Disabling the
Local APIC,"

  When IA32_APIC_BASE[11] is 0, the processor is functionally equivalent
  to an IA-32 processor without an on-chip APIC. The CPUID feature flag
  for the APIC (see Section 10.4.2, "Presence of the Local APIC") is
  also set to 0.
