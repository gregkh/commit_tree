net: inet: Support UID-based routing in IP protocols.

- Use the UID in routing lookups made by protocol connect() and
  sendmsg() functions.
- Make sure that routing lookups triggered by incoming packets
  (e.g., Path MTU discovery) take the UID of the socket into
  account.
- For packets not associated with a userspace socket, (e.g., ping
  replies) use UID 0 inside the user namespace corresponding to
  the network namespace the socket belongs to. This allows
  all namespaces to apply routing and iptables rules to
  kernel-originated traffic in that namespaces by matching UID 0.
  This is better than using the UID of the kernel socket that is
  sending the traffic, because the UID of kernel sockets created
  at namespace creation time (e.g., the per-processor ICMP and
  TCP sockets) is the UID of the user that created the socket,
  which might not be mapped in the namespace.
