staging: iio: tsl2583: use IIO_*_ATTR* macros to create sysfs entries

Use the IIO_CONST_ATTR, IIO_DEVICE_ATTR_RW, and IIO_DEVICE_ATTR_WO
macros for creating the in_illuminance_calibscale_available,
in_illuminance_integration_time_available, in_illuminance_input_target,
in_illuminance_calibrate, and in_illuminance_lux_table sysfs entries.
Previously these sysfs entries were prefixed with illuminance0_, however
they are now prefixed with in_illuminance_ to make these sysfs entries
consistent with how the IIO core is creating the other sysfs entries.
