drm/i915: Improve lockdep tracking for obj->mm.lock

The shrinker may appear to recurse into obj->mm.lock as the shrinker may
be called from a direct reclaim path whilst handling get_pages. We
filter out recursing on the same obj->mm.lock by inspecting
obj->mm.pages, but we do want to take the lock on a second object in
order to reap their pages. lockdep spots the recursion on the same
lockclass and needs annotation to avoid a false positive. To keep the
two paths distinct, create an enum to indicate which subclass of
obj->mm.lock we are using. This removes the false positive and avoids
masking real bugs.
