staging: lustre: llite: Add client mount opt to ignore suppress_pings

When Lustre servers enable 'suppress_pings', all clients will stop
pinging. However, some clients may not have external mechanism
to notify Lustre servers for node death and therefore need to
preserve the Lustre ping.

This patch provides a mount option 'always_ping' so that the
client will not stop pinging even if the server has enabled
'suppress_pings'.
