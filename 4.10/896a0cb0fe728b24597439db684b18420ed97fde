drm/i915: Support for forceful flush of GuC log buffer

GuC firmware sends a flush interrupt to Host when the log buffer is half
full and at that time only it updates the log buffer state.
But in certain cases, as described below, it could be useful to have all
that even when log buffer is only partially full. For that there is a force
log buffer flush Host2GuC action supported by GuC firmware.

For Validation requirements, a forceful flush is needed to collect the
left over logs on disabling logging. The same can be done before proceeding
with GPU/GuC reset as there could be some data in log buffer which is yet
to be captured and those logs would be particularly useful to understand
that why the reset was initiated.
