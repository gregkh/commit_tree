drm/fence: add fence timeline to drm_crtc

Create one timeline context for each CRTC to be able to handle out-fences
and signal them. It adds a few members to struct drm_crtc: fence_context,
where we store the context we get from fence_context_alloc(), the
fence seqno and the fence lock, that we pass in fence_init() to be
used by the fence.
