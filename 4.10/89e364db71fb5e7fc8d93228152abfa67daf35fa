slub: move synchronize_sched out of slab_mutex on shrink

synchronize_sched() is a heavy operation and calling it per each cache
owned by a memory cgroup being destroyed may take quite some time.  What
is worse, it's currently called under the slab_mutex, stalling all works
doing cache creation/destruction.

Actually, there isn't much point in calling synchronize_sched() for each
cache - it's enough to call it just once - after setting cpu_partial for
all caches and before shrinking them.  This way, we can also move it out
of the slab_mutex, which we have to hold for iterating over the slab
cache list.
