soc/qman: Fix h/w resource cleanup error path handling

qman_query_fq*() may return other error codes apart from
-ERANGE, in which cases the error handling done by the
resource cleanup callers would be wrong.  The patch
fixes the handling of those cases, and cleans up related
code inside the resource cleanup & release handlers (i.e.
replace hardcoded fqid value with corresponding define).
