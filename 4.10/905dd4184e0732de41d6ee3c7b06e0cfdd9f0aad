RDS: TCP: Track peer's connection generation number

The RDS transport has to be able to distinguish between
two types of failure events:
(a) when the transport fails (e.g., TCP connection reset)
    but the RDS socket/connection layer on both sides stays
    the same
(b) when the peer's RDS layer itself resets (e.g., due to module
    reload or machine reboot at the peer)
In case (a) both sides must reconnect and continue the RDS messaging
without any message loss or disruption to the message sequence numbers,
and this is achieved by rds_send_path_reset().

In case (b) we should reset all rds_connection state to the
new incarnation of the peer. Examples of state that needs to
be reset are next expected rx sequence number from, or messages to be
retransmitted to, the new incarnation of the peer.

To achieve this, the RDS handshake probe added as part of
commit 5916e2c1554f ("RDS: TCP: Enable multipath RDS for TCP")
is enhanced so that sender and receiver of the RDS ping-probe
will add a generation number as part of the RDS_EXTHDR_GEN_NUM
extension header. Each peer stores local and remote generation
numbers as part of each rds_connection. Changes in generation
number will be detected via incoming handshake probe ping
request or response and will allow the receiver to reset rds_connection
state.
