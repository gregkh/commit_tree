net: dsa: Ensure validity of dst->ds[0]

It is perfectly possible to have non zero indexed switches being present
in a DSA switch tree, in such a case, we will be deferencing a NULL
pointer while dsa_cpu_port_ethtool_{setup,restore}. Be more defensive
and ensure that dst->ds[0] is valid before doing anything with it.
