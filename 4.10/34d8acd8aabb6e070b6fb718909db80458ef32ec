net: bridge: shorten ageing time on topology change

802.1D [1] specifies that the bridges must use a short value to age out
dynamic entries in the Filtering Database for a period, once a topology
change has been communicated by the root bridge.

Add a bridge_ageing_time member in the net_bridge structure to store the
bridge ageing time value configured by the user (ioctl/netlink/sysfs).

If we are using in-kernel STP, shorten the ageing time value to twice
the forward delay used by the topology when the topology change flag is
set. When the flag is cleared, restore the configured ageing time.
