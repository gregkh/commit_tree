drm/i915/gen9+: Use cstate plane mask instead of crtc->state.

I'm planning on getting rid of all obj->state dereferences,
and replace thhem with accessor functions.
Remove this one early, they're equivalent because removed
planes are already part of the state, else they could not
have been removed.
