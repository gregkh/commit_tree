bpf: do not use KMALLOC_SHIFT_MAX

Commit 01b3f52157ff ("bpf: fix allocation warnings in bpf maps and
integer overflow") has added checks for the maximum allocateable size.
It (ab)used KMALLOC_SHIFT_MAX for that purpose.

While this is not incorrect it is not very clean because we already have
KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE for this very reason so let's change both checks to use
KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE instead.

The original motivation for using KMALLOC_SHIFT_MAX was to work around
an incorrect KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE which could lead to allocation warnings
but it is no longer needed since "slab: make sure that KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE
will fit into MAX_ORDER".
