net: usb: asix_devices: add .reset_resume for USB PM

The USB core may call reset_resume when it fails to resume asix device.
And USB core can recovery this abnormal resume at low level driver,
the same .resume at asix driver can work too. Add .reset_resume can
avoid disconnecting after backing from system resume, and NFS can
still be mounted after this commit.
