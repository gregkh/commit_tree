irqchip/gic-v3: Convert arm64 GIC accessors to {read,write}_sysreg_s

The GIC system registers are accessed using open-coded wrappers around
the mrs_s/msr_s asm macros.

This patch moves the code over to the {read,wrote}_sysreg_s accessors
instead, reducing the amount of explicit asm blocks in the arch headers.
