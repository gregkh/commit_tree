ath10k: advertize hardware packet loss mechanism

Indicate hardware (or firmware) supports that CQM packet-loss report
will be generated based on station kickout algorithm. As of now mac80211
tracks connection loss by missing msdu counts (50) whereas ath10k
firmware tracks them by missing ppdus (+ BAR tries). While firmware is
trying to adapt its rate table, mac80211 might send out low_ack event to
hostapd. This is causing frequent connect and disconnect iteration under
noisy environment or when station is roaming around.
