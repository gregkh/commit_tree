dm space map metadata: skip useless memcpy in metadata_ll_init_index()

When metadata_ll_init_index() is called by sm_ll_new_metadata(),
ll->mi_le hasn't been initialized yet. So, when
metadata_ll_init_index() copies the contents of ll->mi_le into the
newly allocated bitmap_root, it is just copying garbage. ll->mi_le
will be allocated later in sm_ll_extend() and copied into the
bitmap_root, in sm_ll_commit().
