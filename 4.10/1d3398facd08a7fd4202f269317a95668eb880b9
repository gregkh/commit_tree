net/mlx5e: Modify TIRs hash only when it's needed

We don't need to modify our TIRs unless the user requested a change in
the hash function/key, for example when changing indirection only.

Tested:
 # Modify TIRs hash is needed
ethtool -X ethX hkey  <new key>
ethtool -X ethX hfunc <new func>

 # Modify TIRs hash is not needed
ethtool -X ethX equal <new indirection table>

All cases are verified with TCP Multi-Stream traffic over IPv4 & IPv6.
