PCI: rockchip: Specify the link capability

rk3399 supports PCIe 2.x link speeds marginally at best, and on some
boards, the link won't train at 5 GT/s at all.  Rather than sacrifice 500ms
waiting for training that will never happen, let's use the helper function,
of_pci_get_max_link_speed(), to get the max link speed from DT and specify
link capability.
