[iov_iter] fix iterate_all_kinds() on empty iterators

Problem similar to ones dealt with in "fold checks into iterate_and_advance()"
and followups, except that in this case we really want to do nothing when
asked for zero-length operation - unlike zero-length iterate_and_advance(),
zero-length iterate_all_kinds() has no side effects, and callers are simpler
that way.

That got exposed when copy_from_iter_full() had been used by tipc, which
builds an msghdr with zero payload and (now) feeds it to a primitive
based on iterate_all_kinds() instead of iterate_and_advance().
