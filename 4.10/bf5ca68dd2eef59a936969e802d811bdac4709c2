powerpc: Fix pgtable pmd cache init

Commit 9b081e10805cd ("powerpc: port 64 bits pgtable_cache to 32 bits")
mixed up PMD_INDEX_SIZE and PMD_CACHE_INDEX a couple of times. This
resulted in 64s/hash/4k configs to panic at boot with a false positive
error check.

Fix that and simplify error handling by moving the check to the caller.
