parisc: Don't use BITS_PER_LONG in userspace-exported swab.h header

In swab.h the "#if BITS_PER_LONG > 32" breaks compiling userspace programs if
BITS_PER_LONG is #defined by userspace with the sizeof() compiler builtin.

Solve this problem by using __BITS_PER_LONG instead.  Since we now
#include asm/bitsperlong.h avoid further potential userspace pollution
by moving the #define of SHIFT_PER_LONG to bitops.h which is not
exported to userspace.

This patch unbreaks compiling qemu on hppa/parisc.
