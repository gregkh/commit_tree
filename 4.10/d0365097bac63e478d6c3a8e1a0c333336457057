staging: lustre: ptlrpc: Move NRS structures out of lustre_net.h

NRS specific structures are not needed in the rest of the PtlRPC code.
It is more appropriate for these structures to be defined in a
separate header. This commit creates a lustre_nrs.h header for the
generic NRS structures, and policy-specific headers for the various
NRS policies.
