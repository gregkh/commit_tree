net: mvneta: select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR

We previously relied on GENERIC_ALLOCATOR to be selected by CONFIG_ARM,
but now we can compile-test the driver on other architectures that
don't select it:

drivers/net/built-in.o: In function `mvneta_bm_remove':
mvneta_bm.c:(.text+0x4ee35): undefined reference to `gen_pool_free'

This adds an explicit select for the part of the driver that has
the dependency.
