tpm: redefine read_log() to handle ACPI/OF at runtime

Currently, read_log() has two implementations: one for ACPI platforms
and the other for device tree(OF) based platforms. The proper one is
selected at compile time using Kconfig and #ifdef in the Makefile,
which is not the recommended approach.

This patch removes the #ifdef in the Makefile by defining a single
read_log() method, which checks for ACPI/OF event log properties at
runtime.
