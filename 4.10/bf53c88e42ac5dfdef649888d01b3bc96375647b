KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Use stop instruction rather than nap on POWER9

POWER9 replaces the various power-saving mode instructions on POWER8
(doze, nap, sleep and rvwinkle) with a single "stop" instruction, plus
a register, PSSCR, which controls the depth of the power-saving mode.
This replaces the use of the nap instruction when threads are idle
during guest execution with the stop instruction, and adds code to
set PSSCR to a value which will allow an SMT mode switch while the
thread is idle (given that the core as a whole won't be idle in these
cases).
