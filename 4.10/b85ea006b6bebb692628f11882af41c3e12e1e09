net: hns: Fix the device being used for dma mapping during TX

This patch fixes the device being used to DMA map skb->data.
Erroneous device assignment causes the crash when SMMU is enabled.
This happens during TX since buffer gets DMA mapped with device
correspondign to net_device and gets unmapped using the device
related to DSAF.
