ARM: dts: r8a7790: Correct SCIFB reg properties to cover all registers

Several SCIFB registers reside outside the reported register ranges.
Fortunately this works (on Linux), due to the PAGE_SIZE granularity of
ioremap().

Extend the sizes from 64 to 0x100 bytes to fix this, like is done on
SH/R-Mobile SoCs.
