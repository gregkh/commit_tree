usb: xhci: fix return value of xhci_setup_device()

xhci_setup_device() should return failure with correct error number
when xhci host has died, removed or halted.

During usb device enumeration, if usb host is not accessible (died,
removed or halted), the hc_driver->address_device() should return
a corresponding error code to usb core. But current xhci driver just
returns success. This misleads usb core to continue the enumeration
by reading the device descriptor, which will result in failure, and
users will get a misleading message like "device descriptor read/8,
error -110".
