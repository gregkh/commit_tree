audit: Fix sleep in atomic

Audit tree code was happily adding new notification marks while holding
spinlocks. Since fsnotify_add_mark() acquires group->mark_mutex this can
lead to sleeping while holding a spinlock, deadlocks due to lock
inversion, and probably other fun. Fix the problem by acquiring
group->mark_mutex earlier.
