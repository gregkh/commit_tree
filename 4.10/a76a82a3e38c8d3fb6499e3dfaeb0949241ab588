perf/core: Fix use-after-free bug

Dmitry reported a KASAN use-after-free on event->group_leader.

It turns out there's a hole in perf_remove_from_context() due to
event_function_call() not calling its function when the task
associated with the event is already dead.

In this case the event will have been detached from the task, but the
grouping will have been retained, such that group operations might
still work properly while there are live child events etc.

This does however mean that we can miss a perf_group_detach() call
when the group decomposes, this in turn can then lead to
use-after-free.

Fix it by explicitly doing the group detach if its still required.
