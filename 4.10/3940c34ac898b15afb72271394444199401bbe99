gpio: tag line labels used for interrupts

When a GPIO line is marked as used for an interrupt, it is
helpful to set the label to "interrupt" so we know what is
going on when inspecting the lines.

If a GPIO is already properly named by gpiod_get*() we don't
need to do this. It only happens when a line is used from
the irqchip side of a GPIO driver without communicating
with the GPIO side, such as when gpiochip is used as interrupt
provider in the device tree.

If the line is still marked as used by "interrupt" when we
unmark it as used by an interrupt, also remove this label
from the descriptor.

Also shape up the code around unmarking IRQ lines.
