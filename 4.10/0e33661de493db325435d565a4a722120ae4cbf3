bpf: add new prog type for cgroup socket filtering

This program type is similar to BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER, except that
it does not allow BPF_LD_[ABS|IND] instructions and hooks up the
bpf_skb_load_bytes() helper.

Programs of this type will be attached to cgroups for network filtering
and accounting.
