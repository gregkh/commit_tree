scsi: fc: implement kref backed reference counting

Implement kref backed reference counting instead of rolling our own. This
elimnates the need of the following fields in 'struct fc_bsg_job':
* ref_cnt
* state_flags
* job_lock
bringing us close to unification of 'struct fc_bsg_job' and 'struct bsg_job'.
