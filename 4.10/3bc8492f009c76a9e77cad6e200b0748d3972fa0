skd: fix msix error handling

As reported by gcc -Wmaybe-uninitialized, the cleanup path for
skd_acquire_msix tries to free the already allocated msi-x vectors
in reverse order, but the index variable may not have been
used yet:

drivers/block/skd_main.c: In function ‘skd_acquire_irq’:
drivers/block/skd_main.c:3890:8: error: ‘i’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This changes the failure path to skip releasing the interrupts
if we have not started requesting them yet.
