xfs: forbid AG btrees with level == 0

There is no such thing as a zero-level AG btree since even a single-node
zero-records btree has one level.  Btree cursor constructors read
cur_nlevels straight from disk and then access things like
cur_bufs[cur_nlevels - 1] which is /really/ bad if cur_nlevels is zero!
Therefore, strengthen the verifiers to prevent this possibility.
