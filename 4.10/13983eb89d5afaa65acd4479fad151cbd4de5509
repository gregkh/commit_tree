PCI/ACPI: Extend pci_mcfg_lookup() to return ECAM config accessors

pci_mcfg_lookup() is the external interface to the generic MCFG code.
Previously it merely looked up the ECAM base address for a given domain and
bus range.  We want a way to add MCFG quirks, some of which may require
special config accessors and adjustments to the ECAM address range.

Extend pci_mcfg_lookup() so it can return a pointer to a pci_ecam_ops
structure and a struct resource for the ECAM address space.  For now, it
always returns &pci_generic_ecam_ops (the standard accessor) and the
resource described by the MCFG.

No functional changes intended.
