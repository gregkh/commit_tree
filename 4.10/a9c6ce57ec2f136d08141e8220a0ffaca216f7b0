led: core: Use atomic bit-field for the blink-flags

All the LED_BLINK* flags are accessed read-modify-write from e.g.
led_set_brightness and led_blink_set_oneshot while both
set_brightness_work and the blink_timer may be running.

If these race then the modify step done by one of them may be lost,
switch the LED_BLINK* flags to a new atomic work_flags bit-field
to avoid this race.
