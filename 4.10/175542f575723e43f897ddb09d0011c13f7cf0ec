radix-tree: add radix_tree_join

This new function allows for the replacement of many smaller entries in
the radix tree with one larger multiorder entry.  From the point of view
of an RCU walker, they may see a mixture of the smaller entries and the
large entry during the same walk, but they will never see NULL for an
index which was populated before the join.
