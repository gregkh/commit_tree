x86/mce/AMD: Reset Threshold Limit after logging error

The error count field in MCA_MISC does not get reset by hardware when the
threshold has been reached. Software is expected to reset it. Currently,
the threshold limit only gets reset during init or when a user writes to
sysfs.

If the user is not monitoring threshold interrupts and resetting
the limit then the user will only see 1 interrupt when the limit is first
hit. So if, for example, the limit is set to 10 then only 1 interrupt will
be recorded after 10 errors even if 100 errors have occurred. The user may
then assume that only 10 errors have occurred.
