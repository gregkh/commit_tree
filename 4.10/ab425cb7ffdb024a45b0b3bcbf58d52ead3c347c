i40e: Fix for long link down notification time

This patch fixes a problem where it could take a very
long time (>100 msec) to print the link down notification.
This problem is fixed by changing how often we update link
info from fw, when link is down. Without this patch, it can
take over 100msec to notify user link is down.
