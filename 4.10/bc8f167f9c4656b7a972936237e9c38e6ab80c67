md/raid5-cache: release the stripe_head at the appropriate location

If we released the 'stripe_head' in r5c_recovery_flush_log,
ctx->cached_list will both release the data-parity stripes and
data-only stripes, which will become empty.
And we also need to use the data-only stripes in
r5c_recovery_rewrite_data_only_stripes, so we should wait util rewrite
data-only stripes is done before releasing them.
