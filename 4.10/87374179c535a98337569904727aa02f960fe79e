block: add a proper block layer data direction encoding

Currently the block layer op_is_write, bio_data_dir and rq_data_dir
helper treat every operation that is not a READ as a data out operation.
This worked surprisingly long, but the new REQ_OP_ZONE_REPORT operation
actually adds a second operation that reads data from the device.
Surprisingly nothing critical relied on this direction, but this might
be a good opportunity to properly fix this issue up.

We take a little inspiration and use the least significant bit of the
operation number to encode the data direction, which just requires us
to renumber the operations to fix this scheme.
