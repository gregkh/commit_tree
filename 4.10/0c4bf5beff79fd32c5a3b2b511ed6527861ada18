mmc: tmio: fix wrong bitmask for SDIO irqs

Commit 7729c7a232a953 ("mmc: tmio: Provide separate interrupt handlers")
refactored the sdio irq handler and wrongly used the mask for SD irqs,
not for SDIO irqs. This doesn't really matter in practice because both
values keep the only interrupt we are interested in. But still, this is
wrong and wants to be fixed.
