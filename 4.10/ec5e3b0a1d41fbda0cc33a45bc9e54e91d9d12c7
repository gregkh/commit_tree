ipv6: Inhibit IPv4-mapped src address on the wire.

This patch adds a check for the problematic case of an IPv4-mapped IPv6
source address and a destination address that is neither an IPv4-mapped
IPv6 address nor in6addr_any, and returns an appropriate error. The
check in done before returning from looking up the route.
