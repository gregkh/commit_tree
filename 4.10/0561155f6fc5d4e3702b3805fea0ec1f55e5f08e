staging: iio: tsl2583: don't shutdown chip when updating the lux table

in_illuminance_lux_table_store() shuts down the chip, updates the
contents of the lux table, and then turns the chip back on. The values
in lux table are not used by the chip and are only used internally by
the driver. It is not necessary to change the power state on the chip.
This patch removes the calls to taos_chip_off() and taos_chip_on()
in in_illuminance_lux_table_store().
