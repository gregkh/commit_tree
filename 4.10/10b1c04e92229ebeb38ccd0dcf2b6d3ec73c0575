net/mlx4_core: Fix raw qp flow steering rules under SRIOV

Demoting simple flow steering rule priority (for DPDK) was achieved by
wrapping FW commands MLX4_QP_FLOW_STEERING_ATTACH/DETACH for the PF
as well, and forcing the priority to MLX4_DOMAIN_NIC in the wrapper
function for the PF and all VFs.

In function mlx4_ib_create_flow(), this change caused the main rule
creation for the PF to be wrapped, while it left the associated
tunnel steering rule creation unwrapped for the PF.

This mismatch caused rule deletion failures in mlx4_ib_destroy_flow()
for the PF when the detach wrapper function did not find the associated
tunnel-steering rule (since creation of that rule for the PF did not
go through the wrapper function).

Fix this by setting MLX4_QP_FLOW_STEERING_ATTACH/DETACH to be "native"
(so that the PF invocation does not go through the wrapper), and perform
the required priority demotion for the PF in the mlx4_ib_create_flow()
code path.
