PCI: Unfold conditions to block runtime PM on PCIe ports

The conditions to block D3 on parent ports are currently condensed into a
single expression in pci_dev_check_d3cold().  Upcoming commits will add
further conditions for hotplug ports, making this expression fairly large
and impenetrable.  Unfold the conditions to maintain readability when they
are amended.

No functional change intended.
