i2c: Make I2C ID tables non-mandatory for DT'ed devices

Currently the I2C framework insists on devices supplying an I2C ID
table.  Many of the devices which do so unnecessarily adding quite a
few wasted lines to kernel code.  This patch allows drivers a means
to 'not' supply the aforementioned table and match on DT match tables
instead.
