HID: sony: Fix memory issue when connecting device using both Bluetooth and USB

A previous patch moved most input initialization from sony_probe to
sony_input_configured to avoid some race conditions. The driver has some
special logic to prevent the device to get registered twice in case the
user connects it both over Bluetooth and USB. When this condition
happens sony_input_configured returns a failure, but sony_probe continues
as hid_hw_start doesn't fail. As was discussed on linux-input, it is
acceptable for this function to fail.

This patch adds a check for the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag within sony_probe
to determine whether initialization succeeded correctly. The flag is
not set by the HID layer when sony_input_configured fails.
