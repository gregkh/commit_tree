openrisc: fix PTRS_PER_PGD define

On OpenRISC, with its 8k pages, PAGE_SHIFT is defined to be 13.
That makes the expression (1UL << (PAGE_SHIFT-2)) evaluate
to 2048.
The correct value for PTRS_PER_PGD should be 256.

Correcting the PTRS_PER_PGD define unveiled a bug in map_ram(),
where PTRS_PER_PGD was used when the intent was to iterate
over a set of page table entries.
This patch corrects that issue as well.
