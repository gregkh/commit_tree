[media] tuner-core: use %&ph for small buffer dumps

This driver has a printk with a continuation lines for debugging purposes.
 Since commit 563873318d32 ("Merge branch 'printk-cleanups'"), this
won't work anymore. We might be using KERNEL_CONT, but it is better
to just use a single printk line using %*ph for buffer dump.
