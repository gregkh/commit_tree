firmware: ti_sci: Add support for Device control

Texas Instrument's System Control Interface (TI-SCI) Message Protocol
is used in Texas Instrument's System on Chip (SoC) such as those
in keystone family K2G SoC to communicate between various compute
processors with a central system controller entity.

TI-SCI message protocol provides support for management of various
hardware entitites within the SoC. Add support driver to allow
communication with system controller entity within the SoC using the
mailbox client.

We introduce the fundamental device management capability support to
the driver protocol as part of this change.
