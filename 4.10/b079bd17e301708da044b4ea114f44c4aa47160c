drm/i915: Bail if plane/crtc init fails

Due to the plane->index not getting readjusted in drm_plane_cleanup(),
we can't continue initialization of some plane/crtc init fails.
Well, we sort of could I suppose if we left all initialized planes on
the list, but that would expose those planes to userspace as well.

But for crtcs the situation is even worse since we assume that
pipe==crtc index occasionally, so we can't really deal with a partially
initialize set of crtcs.

So seems safest to just abort the entire thing if anything goes wrong.
All the failure paths here are kmalloc()s anyway, so it seems unlikely
we'd get very far if these start failing.
