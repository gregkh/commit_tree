md/r5cache: Check array size in r5l_init_log

Currently, r5l_write_stripe checks meta size for each stripe write,
which is not necessary.

With this patch, r5l_init_log checks maximal meta size of the array,
which is (r5l_meta_block + raid_disks x r5l_payload_data_parity).
If this is too big to fit in one page, r5l_init_log aborts.

With current meta data, r5l_log support raid_disks up to 203.
