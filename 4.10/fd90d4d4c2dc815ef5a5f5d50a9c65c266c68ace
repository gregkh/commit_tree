i40iw: Fix memory leak in CQP destroy when in reset

On a device close, the control QP (CQP) is destroyed by calling
cqp_destroy which destroys the CQP and frees its SD buffer memory.
However, if the reset flag is true, cqp_destroy is never called and
leads to a memory leak on SD buffer memory. Fix this by always calling
cqp_destroy, on device close, regardless of reset. The exception to this
when CQP create fails. In this case, the SD buffer memory is already
freed on an error check and there is no need to call cqp_destroy.
