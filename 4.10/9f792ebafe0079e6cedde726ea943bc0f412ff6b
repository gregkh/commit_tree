drm/i915: Store the execution priority on the context

In order to support userspace defining different levels of importance to
different contexts, and in particular the preferred order of execution,
store a priority value on each context. By default, the kernel's
context, which is used for idling and other background tasks, is given
minimum priority (i.e. all user contexts will execute before the kernel).
