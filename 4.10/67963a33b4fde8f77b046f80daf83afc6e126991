mlxsw: Make devlink port instances independent of spectrum/switchx2 port instances

Currently, devlink register/unregister is done directly from
spectrum/switchx2 port create/remove functions. With a need to
introduce a port type change, the devlink port instances have to be
persistent across type changes, therefore across port create/remove
function calls. So do a bit of reshuffling to achieve that.
