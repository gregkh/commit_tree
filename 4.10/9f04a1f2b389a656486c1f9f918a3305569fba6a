drm: dw_hdmi: use of_get_i2c_adapter_by_node interface

This change is needed to properly lock I2C bus driver, which serves
DDC.

The change fixes an overflow over zero of I2C bus driver user counter:

  root@imx6q:~# rmmod i2c_imx
  rmmod: ERROR: Module i2c_imx is in use

Note that prior to this change put_device() coupled with
of_find_i2c_adapter_by_node() was missing on error path of
dw_hdmi_bind(), added i2c_put_adapter() there along with the change.
