arm64: smp: prepare for smp_processor_id() rework

Subsequent patches will make smp_processor_id() use a percpu variable.
This will make smp_processor_id() dependent on the percpu offset, and
thus we cannot use smp_processor_id() to figure out what to initialise
the offset to.

Prepare for this by initialising the percpu offset based on
current::cpu, which will work regardless of how smp_processor_id() is
implemented. Also, make this relationship obvious by placing this code
together at the start of secondary_start_kernel().
