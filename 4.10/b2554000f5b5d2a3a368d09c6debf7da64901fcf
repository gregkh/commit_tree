HID: usbhid: Add quirks for Mayflash/Dragonrise GameCube and PS3 adapters

All known gamepad adapters by Mayflash (identified as Dragonrise) need
HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT to split them up into four input devices. Without this
quirk those adapters are falsely recognized as tablets. Fixes bug 115841
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115841).
