x86/microcode: Use native CPUID to tickle out microcode revision

Intel supplies the microcode revision value in MSR 0x8b
(IA32_BIOS_SIGN_ID) after CPUID(1) has been executed. Execute it each
time before reading that MSR.

It used to do sync_core() which did do CPUID but

  c198b121b1a1 ("x86/asm: Rewrite sync_core() to use IRET-to-self")

changed the sync_core() implementation so we better make the microcode
loading case explicit, as the SDM documents it.
