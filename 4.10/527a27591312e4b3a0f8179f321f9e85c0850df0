dmaengine: omap-dma: Fix the port_window support

We do not yet have users of port_window. The following errors were found
when converting the tusb6010_omap.c musb driver:

- The peripheral side must have SRC_/DST_PACKED disabled
- when configuring the burst for the peripheral side the memory side
  configuration were overwritten: d->csdp = ... -> d->csdp |= ...
- The EI and FI were configured for the wrong sides of the transfers.

With these changes and the converted tus6010_omap.c I was able to verify
that things are working as they expected to work.
