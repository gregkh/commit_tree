printk: Remove no longer used second struct cont

If CONFIG_PRINTK=n:

    kernel/printk/printk.c:1893: warning: ‘cont’ defined but not used

Note that there are actually two different struct cont definitions and
objects: the first one is used if CONFIG_PRINTK=y, the second one became
unused by removing console_cont_flush().

Fixes: 5c2992ee7fd8 ("printk: remove console flushing special cases for partial buffered lines")
