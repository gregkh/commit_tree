block: fast-path for small and simple direct I/O requests

This patch adds a small and simple fast patch for small direct I/O
requests on block devices that don't use AIO.  Between the neat
bio_iov_iter_get_pages helper that avoids allocating a page array
for get_user_pages and the on-stack bio and biovec this avoid memory
allocations and atomic operations entirely in the direct I/O code
(lower levels might still do memory allocations and will usually
have at least some atomic operations, though).
