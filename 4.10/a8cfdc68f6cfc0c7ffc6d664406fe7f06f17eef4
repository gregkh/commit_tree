printk: add Kconfig option to set default console loglevel

Add a configuration option to set the default console loglevel.  This
is, as before, still possible to override at runtime through bootargs
(loglevel=<x>), sysrq and /proc/printk.

There are cases where adding additional arguments on the commandline is
impractical, and changing the default for the kernel when being built
makes more sense.  Provide such a method here, for those who choose to
do so.

Also, while touching this code, clarify the difference between
MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT and CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT.
