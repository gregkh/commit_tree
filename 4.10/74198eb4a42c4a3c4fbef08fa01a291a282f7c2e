Drivers: hv: vmbus: Base host signaling strictly on the ring state

One of the factors that can result in the host concluding that a given
guest in mounting a DOS attack is if the guest generates interrupts
to the host when the host is not expecting it. If these "spurious"
interrupts reach a certain rate, the host can throttle the guest to
minimize the impact. The host computation of the "expected number
of interrupts" is strictly based on the ring transitions. Until
the host logic is fixed, base the guest logic to interrupt solely
on the ring state.
