spi: fsl-espi: make better use of the RX FIFO

So far an interrupt is triggered whenever there's at least one byte
in the RX FIFO. This results in a unnecessarily high number of
interrupts.
Change this to generate an interrupt if
- RX FIFO is half full (except if all bytes to read fit into the
  RX FIFO anyway)
- end of transfer has been reached

This way the number of interrupts can be significantly reduced.
