batman-adv: use consume_skb for non-dropped packets

kfree_skb assumes that an skb is dropped after an failure and notes that.
consume_skb should be used in non-failure situations. Such information is
important for dropmonitor netlink which tells how many packets were dropped
and where this drop happened.
