dma-buf: Introduce fence_get_rcu_safe()

This variant of fence_get_rcu() takes an RCU protected pointer to a
fence and carefully returns a reference to the fence ensuring that it is
not reallocated as it does. This is required when mixing fences and
SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU - although it serves a more pedagogical function atm
