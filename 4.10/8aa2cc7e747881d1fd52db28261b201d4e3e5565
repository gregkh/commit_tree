HID: usbhid: Add quirk for Mayflash/Dragonrise DolphinBar.

The DolphinBar by Mayflash (identified as Dragonrise) needs
HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT to split it up into four input devices. Without this
quirk the adapter is falsely recognized as a tablet. See also bug 115841
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115841).
