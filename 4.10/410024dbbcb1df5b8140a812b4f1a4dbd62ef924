perf report: Add branch flag to callchain cursor node

Since the branch ip has been added to call stack for easier browsing,
this patch adds more branch information. For example, add a flag to
indicate if this ip is a branch, and also add with the branch flag.

Then we can know if the cursor node represents a branch and know what
the branch flag it has.

The branch history code has a loop detection pass that removes loops. It
would be nice for knowing how many loops were removed then in next
steps, we can compute out the average number of iterations.

For example:

Before remove_loops(),
entry0: from = 0x100, to = 0x200
entry1: from = 0x300, to = 0x250
entry2: from = 0x300, to = 0x250
entry3: from = 0x300, to = 0x250
entry4: from = 0x700, to = 0x800

After remove_loops()
entry0: from = 0x100, to = 0x200
entry1: from = 0x300, to = 0x250
entry2: from = 0x700, to = 0x800

The original entry2 and entry3 are removed. So the number of iterations
(from = 0x300, to = 0x250) is equal to removed number + 1 (2 + 1).

iterations = removed number + 1;
average iteractions = Sum(iteractions) / number of samples

This formula ignores other cases, for example, iterations cross multiple
buffers and one buffer contains 2+ loops. Because in practice, it's good
enough.
