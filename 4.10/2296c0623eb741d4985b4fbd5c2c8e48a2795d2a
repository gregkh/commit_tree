staging: iio: cdc: ad7746: implement IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ

This driver predates the availability of IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ
attribute wherein usage has some advantages like it can be accessed by
in-kernel consumers as well as reduces the code size.

Therefore, use IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ to implement the
sampling_frequency attribute instead of using IIO_DEVICE_ATTR() macro.

Move code from the functions associated with IIO_DEVICE_ATTR() into
respective read and write hooks with the mask set to
IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ.
