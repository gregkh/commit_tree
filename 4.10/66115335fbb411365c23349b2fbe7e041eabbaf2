docs: Fix build failure

The 80211.tmpl DocBook file was removed in commit 819bf593767c ("docs-rst:
sphinxify 802.11 documentation"), but the 80211.xml target was re-added to
the Makefile by commit 7ddedebb03b7 ("ALSA: doc: ReSTize
writing-an-alsa-driver document"), leading to a failure when building the
documentation:

*** No rule to make target 'Documentation/DocBook/80211.xml', needed by
'Documentation/DocBook/80211.aux.xml'.
