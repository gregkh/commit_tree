net/sched: em_meta: Fix 'meta vlan' to correctly recognize zero VID frames

META_COLLECTOR int_vlan_tag() assumes that if the accel tag (vlan_tci)
is zero, then no vlan accel tag is present.

This is incorrect for zero VID vlan accel packets, making the following
match fail:
  tc filter add ... basic match 'meta(vlan mask 0xfff eq 0)' ...

Apparently 'int_vlan_tag' was implemented prior VLAN_TAG_PRESENT was
introduced in 05423b2 "vlan: allow null VLAN ID to be used"
(and at time introduced, the 'vlan_tx_tag_get' call in em_meta was not
 adapted).

Fix, testing skb_vlan_tag_present instead of testing skb_vlan_tag_get's
value.

Fixes: 05423b2413 ("vlan: allow null VLAN ID to be used")
Fixes: 1a31f2042e ("netsched: Allow meta match on vlan tag on receive")
