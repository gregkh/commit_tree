mm: turn vmap_purge_lock into a mutex

The purge_lock spinlock causes high latencies with non RT kernel.  This
has been reported multiple times on lkml [1] [2] and affects
applications like audio.

This patch replaces it with a mutex to allow preemption while holding
the lock.

Thanks to Joel Fernandes for the detailed report and analysis as well as
an earlier attempt at fixing this issue.
