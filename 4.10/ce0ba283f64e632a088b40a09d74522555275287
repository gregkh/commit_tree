drm/i915/skl: Move per-pipe ddb allocations into crtc states

First part of cleaning up all of the skl watermark code. This moves the
structures for storing the ddb allocations of each pipe into
intel_crtc_state, along with moving the structures for storing the
current ddb allocations active on hardware into intel_crtc.

Changes since v1:
- Don't replace alloc->start = alloc->end = 0;
