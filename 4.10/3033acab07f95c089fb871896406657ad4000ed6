drm/i915: Queue the idling context switch after all other timelines

Before suspend, we wait for the switch to the kernel context. In order
for all the other context images to be complete upon suspend, that
switch must be the last operation by the GPU (i.e. this idling request
must not overtake any pending requests). To make this request execute last,
we make it depend on every other inflight request.
