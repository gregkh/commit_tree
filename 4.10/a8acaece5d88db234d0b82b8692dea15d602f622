KVM: PPC: Correctly report KVM_CAP_PPC_ALLOC_HTAB

At present KVM on powerpc always reports KVM_CAP_PPC_ALLOC_HTAB as enabled.
However, the ioctl() it advertises (KVM_PPC_ALLOCATE_HTAB) only actually
works on KVM HV.  On KVM PR it will fail with ENOTTY.

QEMU already has a workaround for this, so it's not breaking things in
practice, but it would be better to advertise this correctly.
