arm64: unexport walk_stackframe

The walk_stackframe functions is architecture-specific, with a varying
prototype, and common code should not use it directly. None of its
current users can be built as modules. With THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, users
will also need to hold a stack reference before calling it.

There's no reason for it to be exported, and it's very easy to misuse,
so unexport it for now.
