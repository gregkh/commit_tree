mmc: sdhci: Ignore unexpected CARD_INT interrupts

One of our kernelCI boxes hanged at boot because a faulty eSDHC device
was triggering spurious CARD_INT interrupts for SD cards, causing CMD52
reads, which are not allowed for SD devices.  This adds a sanity check
to the interruption path, preventing that illegal command from getting
sent if the CARD_INT interruption should be disabled.

This quirk allows that particular machine to resume boot despite the
faulty hardware, instead of getting hung dealing with thousands of
mishandled interrupts.
