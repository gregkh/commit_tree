clk: lpc32xx: add a quirk for PWM and MS clock dividers

In common clock framework CLK_DIVIDER_ONE_BASED or'ed with
CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO flags indicates that
1) a divider clock may be set to zero value,
2) divider's zero value is interpreted as a non-divided clock.

On the LPC32xx platform clock dividers of PWM and memory card clocks
comply with the first condition, but zero value means a gated clock,
thus it may happen that the divider value is not updated when
the clock is enabled and the clock remains gated.

The change adds one-shot quirks, which check for zero value of divider
on initialization and set it to a non-zero value, therefore in runtime
a gate clock will work as expected.
