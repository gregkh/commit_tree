Input: da9061 - onkey driver

Copyright header is updated to add DA9061 in its description and the module
description macro is extended to include DA9061.

Minor change to the code, alters dev_dbg() statements to report a generic
"PMIC" instead of DA9063. This device driver is compatible with DA9061,
DA9062 and DA9063.

Kconfig is updated to reflect support for DA9061/62/63.
