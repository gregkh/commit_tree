parisc: Mark cr16 clocksource unstable on SMP systems

The cr16 interval timer of each CPU is not syncronized to other cr16
timers in other CPUs in a SMP system. So, delay the registration of the
cr16 clocksource until all CPUs have been detected and then - if we are
on a SMP machine - mark the cr16 clocksource as unstable and lower it's
rating before registering it at the clocksource framework.

This patch fixes the stalled CPU warnings which we have seen since
introduction of the cr16 clocksource.
