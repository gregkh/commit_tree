xprtrdma: Support for SG_GAP devices

Some devices (such as the Mellanox CX-4) can register, under a
single R_key, a set of memory regions that are not contiguous. When
this is done, all the segments in a Reply list, say, can then be
invalidated in a single LocalInv Work Request (or via Remote
Invalidation, which can invalidate exactly one R_key when completing
a Receive).

This means a single FastReg WR is used to register, and one or zero
LocalInv WRs can invalidate, the memory involved with RDMA transfers
on behalf of an RPC.

In addition, xprtrdma constructs some Reply chunks from three or
more segments. By registering them with SG_GAP, only one segment
is needed for the Reply chunk, allowing the whole chunk to be
invalidated remotely.
