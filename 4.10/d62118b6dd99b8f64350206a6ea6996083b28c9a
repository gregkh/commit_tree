blk-wbt: allow wbt to be enabled always through sysfs

Currently there's no way to enable wbt if it's not enabled in the
kernel config by default for a device. Allow a write to the
'wbt_lat_usec' queue sysfs file to enable wbt.

This is useful for both the kernel config case, but also if the
device is CFQ managed and it was turned off by default.
