perf intel-pt/bts: Tidy instruction buffer size usage

Tidy instruction buffer size usage in preparation for copying the
instruction bytes onto samples.

The instruction buffer is presently used for debugging, so rename its
size macro from INTEL_PT_INSN_DBG_BUF_SZ to INTEL_PT_INSN_BUF_SZ, and
use it everywhere.

Note that the maximum instruction size is 15 which is a less efficient size
to copy than 16, which is why a separate buffer size is used.
