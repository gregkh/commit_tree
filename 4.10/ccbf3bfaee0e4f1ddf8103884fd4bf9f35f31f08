tcp: shortcut listeners in tcp_get_info()

Being lockless in tcp_get_info() is hard, because we need to add
specific synchronization in TCP fast path, like seqcount.

Following patch will change inet_diag_dump_icsk() to no longer
hold any lock for non listeners, so that we can properly acquire
socket lock in get_tcp_info() and let it return more consistent counters.
