crypto: arm64/aes-ccm-ce: fix for big endian

The AES-CCM implementation that uses ARMv8 Crypto Extensions instructions
refers to the AES round keys as pairs of 64-bit quantities, which causes
failures when building the code for big endian. In addition, it byte swaps
the input counter unconditionally, while this is only required for little
endian builds. So fix both issues.
