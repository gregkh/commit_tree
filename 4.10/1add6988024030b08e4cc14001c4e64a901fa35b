iio: adc: Add support for STM32 ADC core

Add core driver for STMicroelectronics STM32 ADC (Analog to Digital
Converter). STM32 ADC can be composed of up to 3 ADCs with shared
resources like clock prescaler, common interrupt line and analog
reference voltage.
This core driver basically manages shared resources.
