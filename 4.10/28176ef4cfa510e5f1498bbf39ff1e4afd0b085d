drm/i915: Reserve space in the global seqno during request allocation

A restriction on our global seqno is that they cannot wrap, and that we
cannot use the value 0. This allows us to detect when a request has not
yet been submitted, its global seqno is still 0, and ensures that
hardware semaphores are monotonic as required by older hardware. To
meet these restrictions when we defer the assignment of the global
seqno, we must check that we have an available slot in the global seqno
space during request construction. If that test fails, we wait for all
requests to be completed and reset the hardware back to 0.
