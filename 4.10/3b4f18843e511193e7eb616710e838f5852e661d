xen-blkfront: correct maximum segment accounting

Making use of "max_indirect_segments=" has issues:
- blkfront_setup_indirect() may end up with zero psegs when PAGE_SIZE
  is sufficiently much larger than XEN_PAGE_SIZE
- the variable driven by the command line option
  (xen_blkif_max_segments) has a somewhat different purpose, and hence
  should namely never end up being zero
- as long as the specified value is lower than the legacy default,
  we better don't use indirect segments at all (or we'd in fact lower
  throughput)
