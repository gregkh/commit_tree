efifb: Show framebuffer layout as device attributes

Userland sometimes needs to know what the framebuffer configuration was
when the firmware was running. This enables us to render localized
status strings during firmware updates using the data from the ACPI BGRT
table and the protocol described at the url below:

This patch also fixes up efifb's printk() usage to use pr_warn() /
pr_info() / pr_err() instead.
