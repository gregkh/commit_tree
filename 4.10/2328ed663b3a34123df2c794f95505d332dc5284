Staging: android: ion: constify dma_buf_ops structure

The dma_buf_ops structure is stored in the ops field of a
dma_buf_export_info structure and also used as a condition inside the
if() statement. The if condition does not modify its value and the
ops field is of type const struct *dma_buf_ops, so dma_buf_ops
structures having this property can be declared as const.
