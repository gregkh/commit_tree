net/af_iucv: don't use paged skbs for TX on HiperSockets

With commit e53743994e21
("af_iucv: use paged SKBs for big outbound messages"),
we transmit paged skbs for both of AF_IUCV's transport modes
(IUCV or HiperSockets).
The qeth driver for Layer 3 HiperSockets currently doesn't
support NETIF_F_SG, so these skbs would just be linearized again
by the stack.
Avoid that overhead by using paged skbs only for IUCV transport.

cc stable, since this also circumvents a significant skb leak when
sending large messages (where the skb then needs to be linearized).
