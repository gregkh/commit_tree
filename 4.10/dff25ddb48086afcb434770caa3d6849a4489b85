nfs: add support for the umask attribute

Clients can set the umask attribute when creating files to cause the
server to apply it always except when inheriting permissions from the
parent directory.  That way, the new files will end up with the same
permissions as files created locally.

See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nfsv4-umask-02 for more details.
