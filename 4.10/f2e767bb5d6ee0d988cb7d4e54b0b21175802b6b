scsi: mpt3sas: Force request partial completion alignment

The firmware or device, possibly under a heavy I/O load, can return on a
partial unaligned boundary. Scsi-ml expects these requests to be
completed on an alignment boundary. Scsi-ml blindly requeues the I/O
without checking the alignment boundary of the I/O request for the
remaining bytes. This leads to errors, since devices cannot perform
non-aligned read/write operations.

This patch fixes the issue in the driver. It aligns unaligned
completions of FS requests, by truncating them to the nearest alignment
boundary.
