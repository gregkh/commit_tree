netfilter: x_tables: move hook state into xt_action_param structure

Place pointer to hook state in xt_action_param structure instead of
copying the fields that we need. After this change xt_action_param fits
into one cacheline.

This patch also adds a set of new wrapper functions to fetch relevant
hook state structure fields.
