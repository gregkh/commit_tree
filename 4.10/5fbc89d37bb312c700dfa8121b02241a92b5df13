thunderbolt, efi: Fix Kconfig dependencies harder

Since commit c9cc3aaa0281 ("thunderbolt: Use Device ROM retrieved from
EFI"), the THUNDERBOLT config option selects APPLE_PROPERTIES.

This broke the build for certain configs because APPLE_PROPERTIES is
located in a menu which depends on EFI:  If EFI is not enabled, the
prerequisites needed for APPLE_PROPERTIES are not selected:  Those are
EFI_DEV_PATH_PARSER and UCS2_STRING.  Additionally EFI_DEV_PATH_PARSER
won't compile unless ACPI is enabled.

Commit 79f9cd35b05e ("thunderbolt, efi: Fix Kconfig dependencies")
sought to fix the breakage by making THUNDERBOLT select APPLE_PROPERTIES
only if EFI_STUB is enabled.  On x86, EFI_STUB depends on EFI and EFI
depends on ACPI, so this fixed the build at least on this architecture.

However on arm and arm64, EFI_STUB does not depend on EFI, so once again
the prerequisites needed for APPLE_PROPERTIES are not selected.
Additionally ACPI is not available on arm and optional on arm64,
therefore EFI_DEV_PATH_PARSER won't compile.

Fix by selecting APPLE_PROPERTIES only on x86.
