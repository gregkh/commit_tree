drm/nouveau/fifo/gf100-: protect channel preempt with subdev mutex

This avoids an issue that occurs when we're attempting to preempt multiple
channels simultaneously.  HW seems to ignore preempt requests while it's
still processing a previous one, which, well, makes sense.

Fixes random "fifo: SCHED_ERROR 0d []" + GPCCS page faults during parallel
piglit runs on (at least) GM107.
