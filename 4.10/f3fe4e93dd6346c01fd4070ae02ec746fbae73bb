mac80211: add a HW flag for supporting HW TX fragmentation

Currently mac80211 determines whether HW does fragmentation
by checking whether the set_frag_threshold callback is set
or not.
However, some drivers may want to set the HW fragmentation
capability depending on HW generation.
Allow this by checking a HW flag instead of checking the
callback.
