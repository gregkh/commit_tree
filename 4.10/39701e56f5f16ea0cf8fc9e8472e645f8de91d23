vfio/spapr: Postpone allocation of userspace version of TCE table

The iommu_table struct manages a hardware TCE table and a vmalloc'd
table with corresponding userspace addresses. Both are allocated when
the default DMA window is created and this happens when the very first
group is attached to a container.

As we are going to allow the userspace to configure container in one
memory context and pas container fd to another, we have to postpones
such allocations till a container fd is passed to the destination
user process so we would account locked memory limit against the actual
container user constrainsts.

This postpones the it_userspace array allocation till it is used first
time for mapping. The unmapping patch already checks if the array is
allocated.
