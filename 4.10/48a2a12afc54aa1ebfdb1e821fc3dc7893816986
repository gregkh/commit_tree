staging: lustre: osc: remove remaining bits for capa support

With capa support removed from the OSC layer a few more bits
can be cleaned up. Convert the OBD getattr and setattr paths
to use struct obdo rather than struct obd_info. Remove
the oi_policy, oi_oa, and oi_capa members from struct obd_info.
