dmaengine: nbpfaxi: add optional max-burst property for memory reads/writes

Due to a hardware bug, reading memory (from the Accelerator Coherency Port)
with a burst size equal to the maximum burst size allowed by the DMA
hardware's buffer size will cause a hardware hang on the ARTPEC-6 SoC,
where the only solution is a manual power cycle.
On ARTPEC-6, this hardware bug does not trigger when writing memory (to the
Accelerator Coherency Port) with a burst size equal to the maximum burst
size allowed by the DMA hardware's buffer size.

To avoid this hardware hang, introduce a new optional max-burst property
for memory reads. For completeness, also introduce a max-burst property for
memory writes.
