blk-wbt: fix old-style function declaration

The newly added driver causes a harmless warning in some configurations:

block/blk-wbt.c:250:1: error: ‘inline’ is not at beginning of declaration [-Werror=old-style-declaration]
 static bool inline stat_sample_valid(struct blk_rq_stat *stat)

This makes it use the expected format for the declaration.
