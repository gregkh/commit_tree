hns: avoid stack overflow with CONFIG_KASAN

The use of ACCESS_ONCE() looks like a micro-optimization to force gcc to use
an indexed load for the register address, but it has an absolutely detrimental
effect on builds with gcc-5 and CONFIG_KASAN=y, leading to a very likely
kernel stack overflow aside from very complex object code:

This does not seem to happen any more with gcc-7, but removing the ACCESS_ONCE
seems safe anyway and it avoids a serious issue for some people. I have verified
that with gcc-5.3.1, the object code we get is better in the new version
both with and without CONFIG_KASAN, as we no longer allocate a 1344 byte
stack frame for hns_dsaf_get_regs() but otherwise have practically identical
object code.

With gcc-7.0.0, removing ACCESS_ONCE has no effect, the object code is already
good either way.

This patch is probably not urgent to get into 4.11 as only KASAN=y builds
with certain compilers are affected, but I still think it makes sense to
backport into older kernels.
