bpf: allow for mount options to specify permissions

Since we recently converted the BPF filesystem over to use mount_nodev(),
we now have the possibility to also hold mount options in sb's s_fs_info.
This work implements mount options support for specifying permissions on
the sb's inode, which will be used by tc when it manually needs to mount
the fs.
