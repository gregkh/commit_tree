i2c: octeon: thunderx: TWSI software reset in recovery

I've seen i2c recovery reporting long loops of:

[ 1035.887818] i2c i2c-4: SCL is stuck low, exit recovery
[ 1037.999748] i2c i2c-4: SCL is stuck low, exit recovery
[ 1040.111694] i2c i2c-4: SCL is stuck low, exit recovery
...

Add a TWSI software reset which clears the status and
STA,STP,IFLG in SW_TWSI_EOP_TWSI_CTL.

With this the recovery works fine and above message is not seen.
