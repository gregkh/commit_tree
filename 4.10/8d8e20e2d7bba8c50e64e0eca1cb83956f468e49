ipvs: Decrement ttl

We decrement the IP ttl in all the modes in order to prevent infinite
route loops. The changes were done based on Julian Anastasov's
suggestions in a prior thread.

The ttl based check/discard and the actual decrement are done in
__ip_vs_get_out_rt() and in __ip_vs_get_out_rt_v6(), for the IPv6
case. decrement_ttl() implements the actual functionality for the
two cases.
