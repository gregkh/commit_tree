powerpc/mm/hugetlb: Don't panic when we don't find the default huge page size

The generic hugetlbfs code can handle not finding the default huge page
size correctly. With HPAGE_SHIFT = 0 we see in dmesg:

  hugetlbfs: disabling because there are no supported hugepage sizes

bash-4.2# echo 30 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
bash: echo: write error: Operation not supported
