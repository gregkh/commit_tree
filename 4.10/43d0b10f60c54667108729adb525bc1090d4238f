rtc: mcp795: fix month write resetting date to 1.

According to Microchip errata some combinations of date and month
values may result in the date being reset to 1, even if the date
is also written with the month (for example 31-07 or 31-08).
As a workaround avoid writing date and month values within the same
Write command. Instead, terminate the Write command after loading
the date and begin a new command to write the month. In addition,
disable the oscillator before loading the new values. This is done
by ensuring both the ST and EXTOSC bits are cleared and waiting for
the OSCON bit to clear.
