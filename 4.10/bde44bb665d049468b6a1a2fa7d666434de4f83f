scsi: ufs: fix failure to read the string descriptor

While reading variable size descriptors (like string descriptor), some UFS
devices may report the "LENGTH" (field in "Transaction Specific fields" of
Query Response UPIU) same as what was requested in Query Request UPIU
instead of reporting the actual size of the variable size descriptor.
Although it's safe to ignore the "LENGTH" field for variable size
descriptors as we can always derive the length of the descriptor from
the descriptor header fields. Hence this change impose the length match
check only for fixed size descriptors (for which we always request the
correct size as part of Query Request UPIU).
