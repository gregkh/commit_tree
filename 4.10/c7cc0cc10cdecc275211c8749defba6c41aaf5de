x86/intel_rdt: Reset per cpu closids on unmount

All CPUs in a rdtgroup are given back to the default rdtgroup before the
rdtgroup is removed during umount. After umount, the default rdtgroup
contains all online CPUs, but the per cpu closids are not cleared. As a
result the stale closid value will be used immediately after the next
mount.

Move all cpus to the default group and update the percpu closid storage.
