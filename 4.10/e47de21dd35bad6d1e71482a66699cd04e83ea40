s390/zcrypt: Fixed attrition of AP adapters and domains

Currently the first eligible AP adapter respectively domain will be
selected to service requests. In case of sequential workload, the
very same adapter/domain will be used.

The adapter/domain selection algorithm now considers the completed
transactions per adaper/domain and therefore ensures a homogeneous
utilization.
