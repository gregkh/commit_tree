net: Update raw socket bind to consider l3 domain

Binding a raw socket to a local address fails if the socket is bound
to an L3 domain:

    $ vrf-test  -s -l 10.100.1.2 -R -I red
    error binding socket: 99: Cannot assign requested address

Update raw_bind to look consider if sk_bound_dev_if is bound to an L3
domain and use inet_addr_type_table to lookup the address.
