drm/i915/gvt: Fix relocation of shadow bb

set_gma_to_bb_cmd() is completely bogus - it is (incorrectly) applying
the rules to read a GTT offset from a command as opposed to writing the
GTT offset. And to cap it all set_gma_to_bb_cmd() is called within a list
iterator of the most strange construction.
