xhci: remove extra URB_SHORT_NOT_OK checks in xhci, core handles most cases

We only check for the URB_SHORT_NOT_OK urb flag to set the urb status
to -EREMOTEIO for transfers that didn't transfer all data.

This will be done in __usb_hcd_giveback() for other than isoc tranfers,
so remove the redundant check from xhci.

Also fix a couple split lines in debug messages to make them greppable.
