arm64: Support systems without FP/ASIMD

The arm64 kernel assumes that FP/ASIMD units are always present
and accesses the FP/ASIMD specific registers unconditionally. This
could cause problems when they are absent. This patch adds the
support for kernel handling systems without FP/ASIMD by skipping the
register access within the kernel. For kvm, we trap the accesses
to FP/ASIMD and inject an undefined instruction exception to the VM.

The callers of the exported kernel_neon_begin_partial() should
make sure that the FP/ASIMD is supported.
