tty/serial: atmel: RS485 half duplex w/DMA: enable RX after TX is done

When using RS485 in half duplex, RX should be enabled when TX is
finished, and stopped when TX starts.

Before commit 0058f0871efe7b01c6 ("tty/serial: atmel: fix RS485 half
duplex with DMA"), RX was not disabled in atmel_start_tx() if the DMA
was used. So, collisions could happened.

But disabling RX in atmel_start_tx() uncovered another bug:
RX was enabled again in the wrong place (in atmel_tx_dma) instead of
being enabled when TX is finished (in atmel_complete_tx_dma), so the
transmission simply stopped.

This bug was not triggered before commit 0058f0871efe7b01c6
("tty/serial: atmel: fix RS485 half duplex with DMA") because RX was
never disabled before.

Moving atmel_start_rx() in atmel_complete_tx_dma() corrects the problem.
