ASoC: samsung: smdk_wm8580: Remove old platforms and drop mach-types usage

MACH_SMDKC100, MACH_SMDKV210 and MACH_SMDKC110 are no longer supported
so we can drop the dead code.  After this the driver no longer
differentiates between machines (S3C24xx machines are not supported by
it) so there is no need to override I2S device id in cpu_dai_name and
SEC_PLAYBACK dai_link can be removed as well.
