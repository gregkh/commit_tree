samples/bpf: silence compiler warnings

silence some of the clang compiler warnings like:
include/linux/fs.h:2693:9: warning: comparison of unsigned enum expression < 0 is always false
arch/x86/include/asm/processor.h:491:30: warning: taking address of packed member 'sp0' of class or structure 'x86_hw_tss' may result in an unaligned pointer value
include/linux/cgroup-defs.h:326:16: warning: field 'cgrp' with variable sized type 'struct cgroup' not at the end of a struct or class is a GNU extension
since they add too much noise to samples/bpf/ build.
