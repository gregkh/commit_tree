ARM: 8631/1: clkdev: Detect errors in clk_hw_register_clkdev() for mass registration

Unlike clk_register_clkdev(), clk_hw_register_clkdev() doesn't check for
passed error objects from a previous registration call. Hence the caller
of clk_hw_register_*() has to check for errors before calling
clk_hw_register_clkdev*().

Make clk_hw_register_clkdev() more similar to clk_register_clkdev() by
adding this error check, removing the burden from callers that do mass
registration.
