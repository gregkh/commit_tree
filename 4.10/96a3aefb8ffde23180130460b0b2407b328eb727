xfs: don't crash if reading a directory results in an unexpected hole

In xfs_dir3_data_read, we can encounter the situation where err == 0 and
*bpp == NULL if the given bno offset happens to be a hole; this leads to
a crash if we try to set the buffer type after the _da_read_buf call.
Holes can happen due to corrupt or malicious entries in the bmbt data,
so be a little more careful when we're handling buffers.
