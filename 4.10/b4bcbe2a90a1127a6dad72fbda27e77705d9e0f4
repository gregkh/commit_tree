drm/i915: Document our internal limit on object size

In many places, we try to count pages using a 32 bit integer. That
implies if we are asked to create an object larger than 43bits, we will
subtly crash much later. Catch this on the boundary, and add a warning
to remind ourselves later on our exabyte systems.
