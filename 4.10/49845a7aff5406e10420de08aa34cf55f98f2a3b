drm/i915/skl+: Clean up minimum allocations, v2.

Move calculating minimum allocations to a helper, which cleans up the
code some more. The cursor is still allocated in advance because it
doesn't count towards data rate and should always be reserved.

changes since v1:
- Change comment to have a extra opening line. (Matt)
- Rebase to remove unused plane->pipe == pipe, handled by the iterator
  now. (Paulo)
