bridge: netfilter: Fix dropping packets that moving through bridge interface

Problem:
br_nf_pre_routing_finish() calls itself instead of
br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge(). Due to this bug reverse path filter drops
packets that go through bridge interface.

User impact:
Local docker containers with bridge network can not communicate with each
other.
