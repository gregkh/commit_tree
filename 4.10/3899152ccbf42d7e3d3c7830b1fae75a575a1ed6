KVM: nVMX: fix checks on CR{0,4} during virtual VMX operation

KVM emulates MSR_IA32_VMX_CR{0,4}_FIXED1 with the value -1ULL, meaning
all CR0 and CR4 bits are allowed to be 1 during VMX operation.

This does not match real hardware, which disallows the high 32 bits of
CR0 to be 1, and disallows reserved bits of CR4 to be 1 (including bits
which are defined in the SDM but missing according to CPUID). A guest
can induce a VM-entry failure by setting these bits in GUEST_CR0 and
GUEST_CR4, despite MSR_IA32_VMX_CR{0,4}_FIXED1 indicating they are
valid.

Since KVM has allowed all bits to be 1 in CR0 and CR4, the existing
checks on these registers do not verify must-be-0 bits. Fix these checks
to identify must-be-0 bits according to MSR_IA32_VMX_CR{0,4}_FIXED1.

This patch should introduce no change in behavior in KVM, since these
MSRs are still -1ULL.
