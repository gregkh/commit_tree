drm/i915: Enable lspcon initialization

This patch adds initialization code for lspcon.
What we are doing here is:
	- Check if lspcon is configured in VBT for this port
	- If lspcon is configured, initialize it and configure it
          as DP port.

V2: Addressed Ville's review comments:
- Not adding AVI IF functions for LSPCON display now.
  This part will be added once the dig_port level AVI-IF series
  gets merged.

V3: Rebase
V4: Rebase
V5: Rebase
V6: Rebase
