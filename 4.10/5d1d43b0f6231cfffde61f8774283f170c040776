iommu/mediatek: Fix M4Uv1 group refcounting

For each subsequent device assigned to the m4u_group after its initial
allocation, we need to take an additional reference. Otherwise, the
caller of iommu_group_get_for_dev() will inadvertently remove the
reference taken by iommu_group_add_device(), and the group will be
freed prematurely if any device is removed.
