cifs_get_root shouldn't use path with tree name

When a server returns the optional flag SMB_SHARE_IS_IN_DFS in response
to a tree connect, cifs_build_path_to_root() will return a pathname
which includes the hostname. This causes problems with cifs_get_root()
which separates each component and does a lookup for each component of
the path which in this case will incorrectly include looking up the
hostname component as a path component.

We encountered a problem with dfs shares hosted by a Netapp. When
connecting to nodes pointed to by the DFS share. The tree connect for
these nodes return SMB_SHARE_IS_IN_DFS resulting failures in lookup
in cifs_get_root().

The patch was tested against a Netapp simulator and by a user using an
actual Netapp server.
