scsi: cxlflash: Wait for active AFU commands to timeout upon tear down

With the removal of the static private command pool, the ability to
'complete' outstanding commands was lost. While not an issue for the
commands originating outside the driver, internal AFU commands are
synchronous and therefore have a timeout associated with them. To
avoid a stale memory access, the tear down sequence needs to ensure
that there are not any active commands before proceeding. As these
internal AFU commands are rare events, the simplest way to accomplish
this is detecting the activity and waiting for it to timeout.
