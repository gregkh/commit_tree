ALSA: hda - ignore the assoc and seq when comparing pin configurations

More and more pin configurations have been adding to the pin quirk
table, lots of them are only different from assoc and seq, but they
all apply to the same QUIRK_FIXUP, if we don't compare assoc and seq
when matching pin configurations, it will greatly reduce the pin
quirk table size.

We have tested this change on a couple of Dell laptops, it worked
well.
