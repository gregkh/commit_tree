drm/i915/hsw: Fix GPU hang during resume from S3-devices state

Currently resuming on HSW from S3 pm_test/devices state leads to an
unrecoverable GPU hang. Resetting the GPU during suspend fixes this. For
a full S3 cycle this change only means the reset happens earlier (before
reaching S3). For S4 the reset will happen now both during the freeze
and quiesce phases, which is a benefit since it will guarantee that the
GPU is idle before creating and loading the hibernation image.
