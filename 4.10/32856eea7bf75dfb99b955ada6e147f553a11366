usb: gadget: udc: atmel: remove memory leak

Commit bbe097f092b0 ("usb: gadget: udc: atmel: fix endpoint name")
introduced a memory leak when unbinding the driver. The endpoint names
would not be freed. Solve that by including the name as a string in struct
usba_ep so it is freed when the endpoint is.
