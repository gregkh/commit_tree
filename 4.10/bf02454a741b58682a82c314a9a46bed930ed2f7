ARC: smp-boot: Decouple Non masters waiting API from jump to entry point

For run-on-reset SMP configs, non master cores call a routine which
waits until Master gives it a "go" signal (currently using a shared
mem flag). The same routine then jumps off the well known entry point of
all non Master cores i.e. @first_lines_of_secondary

This patch moves out the last part into one single place in early boot
code.

This is better in terms of absraction (the wait API only waits) and
returns, leaving out the "jump off to" part.

In actual implementation this requires some restructuring of the early
boot code as well as Master now jumps to BSS setup explicitly,
vs. falling thru into it before.

Technically this patch doesn't cause any functional change, it just
moves the ugly #ifdef'ry from assembly code to "C"
