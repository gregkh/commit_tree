hwmon: (adm9240) Fix overflows seen when writing into limit attributes

Module test reports:

in0_min: Suspected overflow: [3320 vs. 0]
in0_max: Suspected overflow: [3320 vs. 0]
in4_min: Suspected overflow: [15938 vs. 0]
in4_max: Suspected overflow: [15938 vs. 0]
temp1_max: Suspected overflow: [127000 vs. 0]
temp1_max_hyst: Suspected overflow: [127000 vs. 0]
aout_output: Suspected overflow: [1250 vs. 0]

Code analysis reveals that the overflows are caused by conversions
from unsigned long to long to int, combined with multiplications on
passed values.
