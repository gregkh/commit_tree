arm64: hugetlb: fix the wrong address for several functions

The libhugetlbfs meets several failures since the following functions
do not use the correct address:
   huge_ptep_get_and_clear()
   huge_ptep_set_access_flags()
   huge_ptep_set_wrprotect()
   huge_ptep_clear_flush()

This patch fixes the wrong address for them.
