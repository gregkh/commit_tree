ARM: dts: uniphier: make 32bit SoC DTSI linear

I notice some mistakes in the SoC DTSI; wrong interrupts properties
of timer nodes, mismatch between the node name and the compatible
for sdctrl block.  Given those problems fixed, the common parts
among SoCs are less than I had first expected.  The more and more
property overrides are making the SoC DTSI unreadable.

Stretch out the SoC DTSI files and fix the following:

 - Fix the 3rd cell of the interrupts property of the timer nodes
   for Pro4, Pro5, PXs2

 - Fix the node name mioctrl to sdctrl for Pro5, PXs2

 - Fix the second region of l2 node for PXs2
