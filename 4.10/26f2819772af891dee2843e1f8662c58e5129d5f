scsi: sd: Fix wrong DPOFUA disable in sd_read_cache_type

Zoned block devices force the use of READ/WRITE(16) commands by setting
sdkp->use_16_for_rw and clearing sdkp->use_10_for_rw. This result in
DPOFUA always being disabled for these drives as the assumed use of
the deprecated READ/WRITE(6) commands only looks at sdkp->use_10_for_rw.
Strenghten the test by also checking that sdkp->use_16_for_rw is false.
