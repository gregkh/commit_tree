ALSA: seq: Don't handle loop timeout at snd_seq_pool_done()

snd_seq_pool_done() syncs with closing of all opened threads, but it
aborts the wait loop with a timeout, and proceeds to the release
resource even if not all threads have been closed.  The timeout was 5
seconds, and if you run a crazy stuff, it can exceed easily, and may
result in the access of the invalid memory address -- this is what
syzkaller detected in a bug report.

As a fix, let the code graduate from naiveness, simply remove the loop
timeout.
