ACPI/IORT: Add support for ARM SMMU platform devices creation

In ARM ACPI systems, IOMMU components are specified through static
IORT table entries. In order to create platform devices for the
corresponding ARM SMMU components, IORT kernel code should be made
able to parse IORT table entries and create platform devices
dynamically.

This patch adds the generic IORT infrastructure required to create
platform devices for ARM SMMUs.

ARM SMMU versions have different resources requirement therefore this
patch also introduces an IORT specific structure (ie iort_iommu_config)
that contains hooks (to be defined when the corresponding ARM SMMU
driver support is added to the kernel) to be used to define the
platform devices names, init the IOMMUs, count their resources and
finally initialize them.
