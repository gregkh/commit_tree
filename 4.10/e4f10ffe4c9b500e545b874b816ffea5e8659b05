iommu: Make of_iommu_set/get_ops() DT agnostic

The of_iommu_{set/get}_ops() API is used to associate a device
tree node with a specific set of IOMMU operations. The same
kernel interface is required on systems booting with ACPI, where
devices are not associated with a device tree node, therefore
the interface requires generalization.

The struct device fwnode member represents the fwnode token associated
with the device and the struct it points at is firmware specific;
regardless, it is initialized on both ACPI and DT systems and makes an
ideal candidate to use it to associate a set of IOMMU operations to a
given device, through its struct device.fwnode member pointer, paving
the way for representing per-device iommu_ops (ie an iommu instance
associated with a device).

Convert the DT specific of_iommu_{set/get}_ops() interface to
use struct device.fwnode as a look-up token, making the interface
usable on ACPI systems and rename the data structures and the
registration API so that they are made to represent their usage
more clearly.
