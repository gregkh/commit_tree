KVM: nVMX: load GUEST_EFER after GUEST_CR0 during emulated VM-entry

vmx_set_cr0() modifies GUEST_EFER and "IA-32e mode guest" in the current
VMCS. Call vmx_set_efer() after vmx_set_cr0() so that emulated VM-entry
is more faithful to VMCS12.

This patch correctly causes VM-entry to fail when "IA-32e mode guest" is
1 and GUEST_CR0.PG is 0. Previously this configuration would succeed and
"IA-32e mode guest" would silently be disabled by KVM.
