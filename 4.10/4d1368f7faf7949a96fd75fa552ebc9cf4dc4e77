drm/i915: Fix test on inputs for vma_compare()

When supplying a view to vma_compare() it is required that the supplied
i915_address_space is the global GTT. I tested the VMA instead (which is
the current position in the rbtree and maybe from any address space).

(This reapplies commit a44342acde30 ("drm/i915: Fix test on inputs for
vma_compare()") as it was lost in the vma split)
