md/r5cache: disable write back for degraded array

write-back cache in degraded mode introduces corner cases to the array.
Although we try to cover all these corner cases, it is safer to just
disable write-back cache when the array is in degraded mode.

In this patch, we disable writeback cache for degraded mode:
1. On device failure, if the array enters degraded mode, raid5_error()
   will submit async job r5c_disable_writeback_async to disable
   writeback;
2. In r5c_journal_mode_store(), it is invalid to enable writeback in
   degraded mode;
3. In r5c_try_caching_write(), stripes with s->failed>0 will be handled
   in write-through mode.
