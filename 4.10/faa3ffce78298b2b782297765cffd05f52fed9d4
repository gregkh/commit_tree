net/sched: cls_flower: Add support for matching on flags

Add UAPI to provide set of flags for matching, where the flags
provided from user-space are mapped to flow-dissector flags.

The 1st flag allows to match on whether the packet is an
IP fragment and corresponds to the FLOW_DIS_IS_FRAGMENT flag.
