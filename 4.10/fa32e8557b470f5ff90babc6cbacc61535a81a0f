tracing: Add new trace_marker_raw

A new file is created:

 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_marker_raw

This allows for appications to create data structures and write the binary
data directly into it, and then read the trace data out from trace_pipe_raw
into the same type of data structure. This saves on converting numbers into
ASCII that would be required by trace_marker.
