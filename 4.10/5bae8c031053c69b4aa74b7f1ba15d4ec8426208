net/mlx5: E-Switch, Re-enable RoCE on mode change only after FDB destroy

We must re-enable RoCE on the e-switch management port (PF) only after destroying
the FDB in its switchdev/offloaded mode. Otherwise, when encapsulation is supported,
this re-enablement will fail.

Also, it's more natural and symmetric to disable RoCE on the PF before we create
the FDB under switchdev mode, so do that as well and revert if getting into error
during the mode change later.
