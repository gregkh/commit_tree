kernel/watchdog.c: move shared definitions to nmi.h

Patch series "Clean up watchdog handlers", v2.

This is an attempt to cleanup watchdog handlers.  Right now,
kernel/watchdog.c implements both softlockup and hardlockup detectors.
Softlockup code is generic.  Hardlockup code is arch specific.  Some
architectures don't use hardlockup detectors.  They use their own
watchdog detectors.  To make both these combination work, we have
numerous #ifdefs in kernel/watchdog.c.

We are trying here to make these handlers independent of each other.
Also provide an interface for architectures to implement their own
handlers.  watchdog_nmi_enable and watchdog_nmi_disable will be defined
as weak such that architectures can override its definitions.

Thanks to Don Zickus for his suggestions.

This patch (of 3):

Move shared macros and definitions to nmi.h so that watchdog.c, new file
watchdog_hld.c or any other architecture specific handler can use those
definitions.
