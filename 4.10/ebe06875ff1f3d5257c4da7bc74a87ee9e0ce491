net/mlx5e: Support adding ingress tc rule when egress device flag is set

When ndo_setup_tc is called with an egress_dev flag set, it means that
the ndo call was executed on the mirred action (egress) device and not
on the ingress device.

In order to support this kind of ndo_setup_tc call, and insert the
correct decap rule to the hardware, the uplink device on the same eswitch
should be found.

Currently, we use this resolution between the mirred device and the
uplink on the same eswitch to offload vxlan shared device decap rules.
