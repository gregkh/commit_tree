x86/ldt: Make all size computations unsigned

ldt->size can never be negative. The helper functions take 'unsigned int'
arguments which are assigned from ldt->size. The related user space
user_desc struct member entry_number is unsigned as well.

But ldt->size itself and a few local variables which are related to
ldt->size are type 'int' which makes no sense whatsoever and results in
typecasts which make the eyes bleed.

Clean it up and convert everything which is related to ldt->size to
unsigned it.
