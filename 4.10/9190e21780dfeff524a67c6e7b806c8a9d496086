x86/build: Remove three unneeded genhdr-y entries

In x86's include/asm/Kbuild three entries are appended to the genhdr-y make
variable:

    genhdr-y += unistd_32.h
    genhdr-y += unistd_64.h
    genhdr-y += unistd_x32.h

The same entries are also appended to that variable in
include/uapi/asm/Kbuild. So commit:

  10b63956fce7 ("UAPI: Plumb the UAPI Kbuilds into the user header installation and checking")

... removed these three entries from include/asm/Kbuild. But, apparently, some
merge conflict resolution re-added them.

The net effect is, in short, that the genhdr-y make variable contains these
file names twice and, as a consequence, that the corresponding headers get
installed twice. And so the build prints:

  INSTALL usr/include/asm/ (65 files)

... while in reality only 62 files are installed in that directory.

Nothing breaks because of all that, but it's a good idea to finally remove
these unneeded entries nevertheless.
