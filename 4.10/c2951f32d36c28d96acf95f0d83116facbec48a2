btrfs: remove old tree_root dirent processing in btrfs_real_readdir()

Commit 3de4586c527 (Btrfs: Allow subvolumes and snapshots anywhere
in the directory tree) introduced the current system of placing
snapshots in the directory tree.  It also introduced the behavior of
creating the snapshot and then creating the directory entries for it.

We've kept this code around for compatibility reasons, but it turns
out that no file systems with the old tree_root based snapshots can
be mounted on newer (>= 2009) kernels anyway.  About a month after the
above commit, commit 2a7108ad89e (Btrfs: rev the disk format for the
inode compat and csum selection changes) landed, changing the superblock
magic number.

As a result, we know that we'll never encounter tree_root-based dirents
or have to deal with skipping our own snapshot dirents.  Since that
also means that we're now only iterating over DIR_INDEX items, which only
contain one directory entry per leaf item, we don't need to loop over
the leaf item contents anymore either.
