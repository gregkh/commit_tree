ath10k: add platform regulatory domain support

This overrides whatever regulatory the device
EEPROM contains and uses what the platform says
instead - in this implementation the ACPI driver.

In case the hint is not programmed or corrupted (0xffff)
the device falls back to the eeprom programmed settings.
