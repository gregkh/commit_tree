spi: fsl-espi: add support for ESPI RXSKIP mode

This patch adds support for ESPI RXSKIP mode. This mode is optimized
for flash reads:
- sends a number of bytes and then reads a number of bytes
- shifts out zeros automatically when reading

Supporting RXSKIP mode is a prerequisite for supporting dual output
read mode.
