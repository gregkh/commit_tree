powerpc/mm: allow memory hotplug into a memoryless node

Patch series "enable movable nodes on non-x86 configs", v7.

This patchset allows more configs to make use of movable nodes.  When
CONFIG_MOVABLE_NODE is selected, there are two ways to introduce such
nodes into the system:

1. Discover movable nodes at boot. Currently this is only possible on
   x86, but we will enable configs supporting fdt to do the same.

2. Hotplug and online all of a node's memory using online_movable. This
   is already possible on any config supporting memory hotplug, not
   just x86, but the Kconfig doesn't say so. We will fix that.

We'll also remove some cruft on power which would prevent (2).

This patch (of 5):

Remove the check which prevents us from hotplugging into an empty node.

The original commit b226e4621245 ("[PATCH] powerpc: don't add memory to
empty node/zone"), states that this was intended to be a temporary measure.
It is a workaround for an oops which no longer occurs.
