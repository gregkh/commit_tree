neigh: Send netevent after marking neigh as dead

neigh_cleanup_and_release() is always called after marking a neighbour
as dead, but it only notifies user space and not in-kernel listeners of
the netevent notification chain.

This can cause multiple problems. In my specific use case, it causes the
listener (a switch driver capable of L3 offloads) to believe a neighbour
entry is still valid, and is thus erroneously kept in the device's
table.

Fix that by sending a netevent after marking the neighbour as dead.
