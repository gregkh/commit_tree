IB/hns: Fix the bug when free cq

If the resources of cq are freed while executing the user case, hardware
can not been notified in hip06 SoC. Then hardware will hold on when it
writes the cq buffer which has been released.

In order to slove this problem, RoCE driver checks the CQE counter, and
ensure that the outstanding CQE have been written. Then the cq buffer
can be released.
