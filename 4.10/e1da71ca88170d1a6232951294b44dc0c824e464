i40e: Drop code for unsupported flow types

We cannot currently support SCTP in the hardware, and IPV4_FLOW is not used
anywhere by the software so we can go through and drop the functionality
related to these two flow types.

In addition we cannot support masking based on the protocol value so if the
user is expecting a value other than TCP or UDP we should simply return an
error rather then trying to allocate a filter for a rule that will only
partially match what the user requested.
