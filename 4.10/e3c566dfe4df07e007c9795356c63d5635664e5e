drm/i915: Remove some duplicated plane swapping logic

On pre-gen4 we connect plane A to pipe B and vice versa to get an FBC
capable plane feeding the LVDS port by default. We have the logic for
the plane swapping duplicated in many places. Let's remove a bit of the
duplication by having the crtc look up the thing from the primary plane.
