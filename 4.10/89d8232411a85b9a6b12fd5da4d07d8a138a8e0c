tty/serial: atmel_serial: BUG: stop DMA from transmitting in stop_tx

If we don't disable the transmitter in atmel_stop_tx, the DMA buffer
continues to send data until it is emptied.
This cause problems with the flow control (CTS is asserted and data are
still sent).

So, disabling the transmitter in atmel_stop_tx is a sane thing to do.

Tested on at91sam9g35-cm(DMA)
Tested for regressions on sama5d2-xplained(Fifo) and at91sam9g20ek(PDC)
