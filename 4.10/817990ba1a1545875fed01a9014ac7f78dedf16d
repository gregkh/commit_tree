staging: lustre: obdclass: limit lu_site hash table size on clients

Allocating a big hash table using the current formula
does not really work for clients. We will create new
hash table for each mount on a single client which is
a lot of memory more than expected.

This patch limits the hash table up to 8M for clients,
which has 524288 entries.
