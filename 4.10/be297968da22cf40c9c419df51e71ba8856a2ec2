mm: only include blk_types in swap.h if CONFIG_SWAP is enabled

It's only needed for the CONFIG_SWAP-only use of bio_end_io_t.

Because CONFIG_SWAP implies CONFIG_BLOCK this will allow to drop some
ifdefs in blk_types.h.

Instead we'll need to add a few explicit includes that were implicit
before, though.
