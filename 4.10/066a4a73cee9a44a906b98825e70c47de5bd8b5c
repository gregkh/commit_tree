blk-mq: blk_mq_try_issue_directly() should lookup hardware queue

A previous commit changed this to pass in the hardware queue, but
it was using the wrong hardware queue. Hence a request that was
allocated on one hardware queue ended up being issued on another
one, and that caused IO timeouts and oopses on some drivers. Since
the request holds hardware queue private resources, like a tag,
we can't just issue it on a different hardware queue.
