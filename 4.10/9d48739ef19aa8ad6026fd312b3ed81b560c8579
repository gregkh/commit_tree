md: change all printk() to pr_err() or pr_warn() etc.

1/ using pr_debug() for a number of messages reduces the noise of
   md, but still allows them to be enabled when needed.
2/ try to be consistent in the usage of pr_err() and pr_warn(), and
   document the intention
3/ When strings have been split onto multiple lines, rejoin into
   a single string.
   The cost of having lines > 80 chars is less than the cost of not
   being able to easily search for a particular message.
