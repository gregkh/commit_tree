samples/bpf: Remove perf_event_open() declaration

This declaration was made in samples/bpf/libbpf.c for convenience, but
there's already one in tools/perf/perf-sys.h. Reuse that one.

Committer notes:

Testing it:

  $ make -j4 O=../build/v4.9.0-rc8+ samples/bpf/
  make[1]: Entering directory '/home/build/v4.9.0-rc8+'
    CHK     include/config/kernel.release
    GEN     ./Makefile
    CHK     include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h
    Using /home/acme/git/linux as source for kernel
    CHK     include/generated/utsrelease.h
    CHK     include/generated/timeconst.h
    CHK     include/generated/bounds.h
    CHK     include/generated/asm-offsets.h
    CALL    /home/acme/git/linux/scripts/checksyscalls.sh

    HOSTCC  samples/bpf/sock_example.o
    HOSTCC  samples/bpf/bpf_load.o
<SNIP>
    HOSTLD  samples/bpf/trace_event
    HOSTLD  samples/bpf/sampleip
    HOSTLD  samples/bpf/tc_l2_redirect
  make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/build/v4.9.0-rc8+'
  $

Also tested the offwaketime resulting from the rebuild, seems to work as
before.
