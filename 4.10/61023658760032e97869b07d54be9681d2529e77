bpf: Add new cgroup attach type to enable sock modifications

Add new cgroup based program type, BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK. Similar to
BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB programs can be attached to a cgroup and run
any time a process in the cgroup opens an AF_INET or AF_INET6 socket.
Currently only sk_bound_dev_if is exported to userspace for modification
by a bpf program.

This allows a cgroup to be configured such that AF_INET{6} sockets opened
by processes are automatically bound to a specific device. In turn, this
enables the running of programs that do not support SO_BINDTODEVICE in a
specific VRF context / L3 domain.
