md: Use REQ_FAILFAST_* on metadata writes where appropriate

This can only be supported on personalities which ensure
that md_error() never causes an array to enter the 'failed'
state.  i.e. if marking a device Faulty would cause some
data to be inaccessible, the device is status is left as
non-Faulty.  This is true for RAID1 and RAID10.

If we get a failure writing metadata but the device doesn't
fail, it must be the last device so we re-write without
FAILFAST to improve chance of success.  We also flag the
device as LastDev so that future metadata updates don't
waste time on failfast writes.
