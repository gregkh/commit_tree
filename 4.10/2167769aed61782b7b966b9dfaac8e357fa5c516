staging: iio: tsl2583: fix issue with changes to calibscale and int_time not being set on the chip

When updating the in_illuminance_calibscale and
in_illuminance_integration_time sysfs attributes, these values were not
actually written to the chip. The chip would continue to use the old
parameters. Extracted out tsl2583_set_als_gain() and
tsl2583_set_als_time() functions that are now called when these sysfs
attributes are updated. The chip initialization also calls these these
new functions.
