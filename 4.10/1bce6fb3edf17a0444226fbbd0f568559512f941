[media] s5p-mfc: Rework clock handling

This patch changes the code for handling clocks. Now clocks are defined
per each device variant, what is a preparation for adding support for
Exynos 5433 MFC V8, which has more clocks than all previous versions.
Also use devm_clk_get() to simplify cleanup path.
