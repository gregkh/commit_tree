iio: common: st_sensors: fix channel data parsing

Using realbits as i2c/spi read len, when that value is not byte aligned
(e.g 12 bits), lead to skip msb part of out data registers.
Fix this taking into account scan_type.shift in addition to
scan_type.realbits as read length:

read_len = DIV_ROUND_UP(realbits + shift, 8)

This fix has been tested on 8, 12, 16, 24 bit sensors
