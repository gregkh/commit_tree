s390/smp: initialize cpu_present_mask in setup_arch

In order to be able to setup the cpu to node mappings early it is a
prerequisite to know which cpus are present. Therefore cpus must be
detected much earlier than before.

For sclp based cpu detection this requires yet another early sclp
call, since the system is not ready to use the regular interrupt and
memory allocations.
