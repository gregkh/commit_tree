x86/intel_rdt: Prevent deadlock against hotplug lock

The cpu online/offline callbacks of intel_rdt lock rdtgroup_mutex nested
inside of cpu hotplug lock. rdtgroup_cpus_write() does it in reverse order.

Remove the get/put_online_cpus() calls from rdtgroup_cpus_write(). This is
safe against cpu hotplug as the resource group cpumasks are protected by
rdtgroup_mutex.

Found by review, but should have been found if authors would have bothered
to test cpu hotplug with lockdep enabled.
