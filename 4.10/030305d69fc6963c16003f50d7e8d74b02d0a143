PCI/ASPM: Handle PCI-to-PCIe bridges as roots of PCIe hierarchies

In a struct pcie_link_state, link->root points to the pcie_link_state of
the root of the PCIe hierarchy.  For the topmost link, this points to
itself (link->root = link).  For others, we copy the pointer from the
parent (link->root = link->parent->root).

Previously we recognized that Root Ports originated PCIe hierarchies, but
we treated PCI/PCI-X to PCIe Bridges as being in the middle of the
hierarchy, and when we tried to copy the pointer from link->parent->root,
there was no parent, and we dereferenced a NULL pointer:

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000090
  IP: [<ffffffff9e424350>] pcie_aspm_init_link_state+0x170/0x820

Recognize that PCI/PCI-X to PCIe Bridges originate PCIe hierarchies just
like Root Ports do, so link->root for these devices should also point to
itself.
