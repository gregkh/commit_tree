clk: cdce925: Fix limit check

It is likely that instead of '1>64', 'q>64' was expected.

Moreover, according to datasheet,
   http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cdce925.pdf
   SCAS847I - JULY 2007 - REVISED OCTOBER 2016
PLL settings limits are: 16 <= q <= 63
So change the upper limit check from 64 to 63.
