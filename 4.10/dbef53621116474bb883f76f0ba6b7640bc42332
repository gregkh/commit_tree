mac80211: prevent skb/txq mismatch

Station structure is considered as not uploaded
(to driver) until drv_sta_state() finishes. This
call is however done after the structure is
attached to mac80211 internal lists and hashes.
This means mac80211 can lookup (and use) station
structure before it is uploaded to a driver.

If this happens (structure exists, but
sta->uploaded is false) fast_tx path can still be
taken. Deep in the fastpath call the sta->uploaded
is checked against to derive "pubsta" argument for
ieee80211_get_txq(). If sta->uploaded is false
(and sta is actually non-NULL) ieee80211_get_txq()
effectively downgraded to vif->txq.

At first glance this may look innocent but coerces
mac80211 into a state that is almost guaranteed
(codel may drop offending skb) to crash because a
station-oriented skb gets queued up on
vif-oriented txq. The ieee80211_tx_dequeue() ends
up looking at info->control.flags and tries to use
txq->sta which in the fail case is NULL.

It's probably pointless to pretend one can
downgrade skb from sta-txq to vif-txq.

Since downgrading unicast traffic to vif->txq must
not be done there's no txq to put a frame on if
sta->uploaded is false. Therefore the code is made
to fall back to regular tx() op path if the
described condition is hit.

Only drivers using wake_tx_queue were affected.
