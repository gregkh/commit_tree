drivers: base: cacheinfo: fix x86 with CONFIG_OF enabled

With CONFIG_OF enabled on x86, we get the following error on boot:
"
	Failed to find cpu0 device node
 	Unable to detect cache hierarchy from DT for CPU 0
"
and the cacheinfo fails to get populated in the corresponding sysfs
entries. This is because cache_setup_of_node looks for of_node for
setting up the shared cpu_map without checking that it's already
populated in the architecture specific callback.

In order to indicate that the shared cpu_map is already populated, this
patch introduces a boolean `cpu_map_populated` in struct cpu_cacheinfo
that can be used by the generic code to skip cache_shared_cpu_map_setup.

This patch also sets that boolean for x86.
