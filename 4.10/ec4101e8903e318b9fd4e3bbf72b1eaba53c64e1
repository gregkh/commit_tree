timekeeping/clocksource_cyc2ns: Document intended range limitation

The "cycles" argument should not be an absolute clocksource cycle
value, as the implementation's arithmetic will overflow relatively
easily with wide (64 bit) clocksource counters.

For performance, the implementation is simple and fast, since the
function is intended for only relatively small delta values of
clocksource cycles.
