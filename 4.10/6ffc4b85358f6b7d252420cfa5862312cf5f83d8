hv: change clockevents unbind tactics

To get prepared to CPU offlining support we need co change the way how we
unbind clockevent devices. As one CPU may go online/offline multiple times
we need to bind it in hv_synic_init() and unbind it in hv_synic_cleanup().
There is an additional corner case: when we unload the module completely we
need to switch to some other clockevent mechanism before stopping VMBus or
we will hang. We can't call hv_synic_cleanup() before unloading VMBus as
we won't be able to send UNLOAD request and get a response so
hv_synic_clockevents_cleanup() has to live. Luckily, we can always call
clockevents_unbind_device(), even if it wasn't bound before and there is
no issue if we call it twice.
