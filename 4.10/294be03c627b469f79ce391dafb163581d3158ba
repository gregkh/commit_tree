i2c: pxa: Add support for the I2C units found in Armada 3700

The Armada 3700 has two I2C controllers that is compliant with the I2C
Bus Specificiation 2.1, supports multi-master and different bus speed:
Standard mode (up to 100 KHz), Fast mode (up to 400 KHz),
High speed mode (up to 3.4 Mhz).

This IP block has a lot of similarity with the PXA, except some register
offsets and bitfield. This commits adds a basic support for this I2C
unit.
