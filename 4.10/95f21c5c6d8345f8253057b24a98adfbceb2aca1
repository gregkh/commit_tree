Documentation/device-mapper: s/getsize/getsz/

According to `man blockdev':

  --getsize
         Print device size (32-bit!) in sectors.
         Deprecated in favor of the --getsz option.
  ...
  --getsz
         Get size in 512-byte sectors.

Hence, occurrences of `--getsize' should be replaced with `--getsz',
which this commit has achieved as follows:

  $ cd "$repo"
  $ git grep -l -e --getsz

  Documentation/device-mapper/linear.txt
  Documentation/device-mapper/log-writes.txt
  Documentation/device-mapper/striped.txt
  Documentation/device-mapper/switch.txt
  $ cd Documentation/device-mapper
  $ sed -i s/getsize/getsz/g *
