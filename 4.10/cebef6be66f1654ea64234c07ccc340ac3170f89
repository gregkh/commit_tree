arm64: dts: exynos: Fix IRQ type flags for Exynos5433 SoC

Interrupt of type IRQ_TYPE_NONE is not allowed for GIC interrupts. The
GIC requires shared interrupts to be edge rising or level high. Platform
declares support for both. Set all interrupts type to level high, as this
works fine - tested on Exynos5433-based TM2 board.
