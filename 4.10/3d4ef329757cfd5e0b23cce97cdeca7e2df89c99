mmc: core: fix multi-bit bus width without high-speed mode

Commit 577fb13199b1 ("mmc: rework selection of bus speed mode")
refactored bus width selection code to mmc_select_bus_width().

However, it also altered the behavior to not call the selection code in
non-high-speed modes anymore.

This causes 1-bit mode to always be used when the high-speed mode is not
enabled, even though 4-bit and 8-bit bus are valid bus widths in the
backwards-compatibility (legacy) mode as well (see e.g. 5.3.2 Bus Speed
Modes in JEDEC 84-B50). This results in a significant regression in
transfer speeds.

Fix the code to allow 4-bit and 8-bit widths even without high-speed
mode, as before.

Tested with a Zynq-7000 PicoZed 7020 board.
