mm, memcg: fix the active list aging for lowmem requests when memcg is enabled

the oom killer is clearly pre-mature because there there is still a lot
of page cache in the zone Normal which should satisfy this lowmem
request.  Further debugging has shown that the reclaim cannot make any
forward progress because the page cache is hidden in the active list
which doesn't get rotated because inactive_list_is_low is not memcg
aware.

The code simply subtracts per-zone highmem counters from the respective
memcg's lru sizes which doesn't make any sense.  We can simply end up
always seeing the resulting active and inactive counts 0 and return
false.  This issue is not limited to 32b kernels but in practice the
effect on systems without CONFIG_HIGHMEM would be much harder to notice
because we do not invoke the OOM killer for allocations requests
targeting < ZONE_NORMAL.

Fix the issue by tracking per zone lru page counts in mem_cgroup_per_node
and subtract per-memcg highmem counts when memcg is enabled.  Introduce
helper lruvec_zone_lru_size which redirects to either zone counters or
mem_cgroup_get_zone_lru_size when appropriate.

We are losing empty LRU but non-zero lru size detection introduced by
ca707239e8a7 ("mm: update_lru_size warn and reset bad lru_size") because
of the inherent zone vs. node discrepancy.
