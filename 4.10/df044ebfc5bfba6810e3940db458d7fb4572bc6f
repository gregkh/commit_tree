staging: vc04_services: don't print pointers directly

kernel pointers should be printed with %pK and are not unsigned int big
on all architectures.  So fix this up to get rid of a bunch of warning
messages.

Note, there are other assumptions in this code that a pointer fits into
an int that need to be fixed up later.
