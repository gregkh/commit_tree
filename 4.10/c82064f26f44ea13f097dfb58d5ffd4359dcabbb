ACPI / gpio: avoid warning for gpio hogging code

The newly added acpi_gpiochip_scan_gpios function produces a few harmless
warnings:

drivers/gpio/gpiolib-acpi.c: In function ‘acpi_gpiochip_add’:
drivers/gpio/gpiolib-acpi.c:925:7: error: ‘dflags’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/gpio/gpiolib-acpi.c:925:9: error: ‘lflags’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The problem is that he compiler cannot know that a negative return value
from fwnode_property_read_u32_array() or acpi_gpiochip_pin_to_gpio_offset()
implies that the IS_ERR(gpio_desc) is true, as the value could in theory
be below -MAX_ERRNO.

The function already initializes its output values to zero, and moving
that intialization a little higher up ensures that we can never have
uninitialized data in the caller.
