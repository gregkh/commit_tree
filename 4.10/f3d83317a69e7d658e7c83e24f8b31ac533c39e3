Revert "ALSA: line6: Only determine control port properties if needed"

This reverts commit f6a0dd107ad0c8b59d1c9735eea4b8cb9f460949.

The commit caused a regression on LINE6 Transport that has no control
caps.  Although reverting the commit may result back in a spurious
error message for some device again, it's the simplest regression fix,
hence it's taken as is at first.  The further code fix will follow
later.
