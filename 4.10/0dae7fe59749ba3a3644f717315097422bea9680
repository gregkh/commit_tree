dm crypt: use bio_add_page()

Use bio_add_page(), the standard interface for adding a page to a bio,
rather than open-coding the same.

It should be noted that the 'clone' bio that is allocated using
bio_alloc_bioset(), in crypt_alloc_buffer(), does _not_ set the
bio's BIO_CLONED flag.  As such, bio_add_page()'s early return for true
bio clones (those with BIO_CLONED set) isn't applicable.
