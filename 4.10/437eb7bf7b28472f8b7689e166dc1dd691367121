ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Make device_is_managed_by_native_pciehp() public

We're about to add runtime PM of hotplug ports, but we need to restrict it
to ports that are handled natively by the OS:  If they're handled by the
firmware (which is the case for Thunderbolt on non-Macs), things would
break if the OS put the ports into D3hot behind the firmware's back.

To determine if a hotplug port is handled natively, one has to walk up from
the port to the root bridge and check the cached _OSC Control Field for the
value of the "PCI Express Native Hot Plug control" bit.  There's already a
function to do that, device_is_managed_by_native_pciehp(), but it's private
to drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c and only compiled in if
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI is enabled.

Make it public and move it to drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c, so that it is
available in the more general CONFIG_ACPI case.

The function contains a check if the device in question is a hotplug port
and returns false if it's not.  The caller we're going to add doesn't need
this as it only calls the function if it actually *is* a hotplug port.
Move the check out of the function into the single existing caller.

Rename it to pciehp_is_native() and add some kerneldoc and polish.

No functional change intended.
