PM / Domains: Add residency property to genpd states

Residency of a domain's idle state indicates that the minimum idle time
for the domain's idle state to be beneficial for power. Add the
parameter to the state node. Future patches, will use the residency
value in the genpd governor to determine if it is worth while to enter
an idle state.
