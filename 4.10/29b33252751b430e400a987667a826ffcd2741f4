scsi: be2iscsi: set errno on error path

Variable ret is reset in the loop, and its value will be 0 during the
second and after repeat of the loop. If pci_alloc_consistent() returns a
NULL pointer then, it will leaves with return value 0. 0 means no error,
which is contrary to the fact. This patches fixes the bug, explicitly
assigning "-ENOMEM" to return variable ret on the path that the call to
pci_alloc_consistent() fails.
