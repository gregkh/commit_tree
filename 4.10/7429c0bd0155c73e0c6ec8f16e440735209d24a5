i40e: remove error_param_int label from i40e_vc_config_promiscuous_mode_msg

This label is unnecessary, as are jumping to a block that checks aq_ret
and then immediately skipping it and returning. So just jump straight to
the error_param and remove this unnecessary label.

Also use goto error_param even in the last check for style consistency.
