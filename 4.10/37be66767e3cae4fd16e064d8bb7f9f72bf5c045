usb: hub: Fix auto-remount of safely removed or ejected USB-3 devices

USB-3 does not have any link state that will avoid negotiating a connection
with a plugged-in cable but will signal the host when the cable is
unplugged.

For USB-3 we used to first set the link to Disabled, then to RxDdetect to
be able to detect cable connects or disconnects. But in RxDetect the
connected device is detected again and eventually enabled.

Instead set the link into U3 and disable remote wakeups for the device.
This is what Windows does, and what Alan Stern suggested.
