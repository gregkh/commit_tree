[media] v4l: Add 16-bit raw bayer pixel formats

The formats added by this patch are:

	V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR16
	V4L2_PIX_FMT_SGBRG16
	V4L2_PIX_FMT_SGRBG16

V4L2_PIX_FMT_SRGGB16 already existed before the patch. Rework the
documentation to match that of the other sample depths.

Also align the description of V4L2_PIX_FMT_SRGGB16 to match with other
similar formats.
