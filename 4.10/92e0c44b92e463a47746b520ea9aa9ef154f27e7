mmc: sdhci: Use sdhci-caps-mask and sdhci-caps to change the caps read during __sdhci_read_caps

The sdhci capabilities register can be incorrect. The sdhci-caps-mask
and sdhci-caps dt properties specify which bits of the register are
incorrect and what their values should be. This patch makes the sdhci
driver use those properties to correct the caps during
__sdhci_read_caps.

During __sdhci_read_caps
Use the sdhci-caps-mask property to turn off the incorrect bits of the
sdhci register after reading them.
Use the sdhci-caps to turn on bits after using sdhci-caps-mask to turn
off the incorrect ones.
