USB: serial: mos7720: fix parallel probe

A static usb-serial-driver structure that is used to initialise the
interrupt URB was modified during probe depending on the currently
probed device type, something which could break a parallel probe of a
device of a different type.

Fix this up by overriding the default completion callback for MCS7715
devices in attach() instead. We may want to use two usb-serial driver
instances for the two types later.

moschip 7715")
