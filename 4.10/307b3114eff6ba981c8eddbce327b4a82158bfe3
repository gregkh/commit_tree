s390/numa: always use logical cpu and core ids

The toptree algorithm uses the physical core ids to create a mapping
between cores and nodes (to_node_id array within emu_cores structure).
The core ids are used as an index into an array which size depends on
CONFIG_NR_CPUS. If the physical core ids are larger, this will result
in out-of-bounds write accesses.

Generate logical core ids instead to avoid this.
