s390: char: make slp_ctl explicitly non-modular

The Makefile currently controlling compilation of this code is obj-y,
meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular usage, so that when reading
the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_misc_device translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.
