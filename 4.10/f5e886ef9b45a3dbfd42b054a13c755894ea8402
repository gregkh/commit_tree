x86/MCE: Do not look at panic_on_oops in the severity grading

The MCE tolerance levels control whether we panic on a machine check or do
something else like generating a signal and logging error information. This
is controlled by the mce=<level> command line parameter.

However, if panic_on_oops is set, it will force a panic for such an MCE
even though the user didn't want to.

So don't check panic_on_oops in the severity grading anymore.

One of the use cases for that is recovery from uncorrectable errors with
mce=2.
