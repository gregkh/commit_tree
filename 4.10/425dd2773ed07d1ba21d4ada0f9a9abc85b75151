ARM: dts: imx6q-utilite-pro: i2c1 is muxed

It turns out that the i2c1 adapter is connected to a multiplexer
controlled by a gpio line. The first (default) mux option connects
i2c1 to a bus connected to the already known peripherals. The other
one connects the adapter to the ddc pins of the DVI port.
