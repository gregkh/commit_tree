percpu-refcount: fix reference leak during percpu-atomic transition

percpu_ref_tryget() and percpu_ref_tryget_live() should return
"true" IFF they acquire a reference. But the return value from
atomic_long_inc_not_zero() is a long and may have high bits set,
e.g. PERCPU_COUNT_BIAS, and the return value of the tryget routines
is bool so the reference may actually be acquired but the routines
return "false" which results in a reference leak since the caller
assumes it does not need to do a corresponding percpu_ref_put().

This was seen when performing CPU hotplug during I/O, as hangs in
blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait where percpu_ref_kill (blk_mq_freeze_queue_start)
raced with percpu_ref_tryget (blk_mq_timeout_work).
Sample stack trace:

Examination of the queue showed a single reference (no PERCPU_COUNT_BIAS,
and __PERCPU_REF_DEAD, __PERCPU_REF_ATOMIC set) and no requests.
However, conditions at the time of the race are count of PERCPU_COUNT_BIAS + 0
and __PERCPU_REF_DEAD and __PERCPU_REF_ATOMIC set.

The fix is to make the tryget routines use an actual boolean internally instead
of the atomic long result truncated to a int.
