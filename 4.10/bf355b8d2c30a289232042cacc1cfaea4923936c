ipv6: sr: add core files for SR HMAC support

This patch adds the necessary functions to compute and check the HMAC signature
of an SR-enabled packet. Two HMAC algorithms are supported: hmac(sha1) and
hmac(sha256).

In order to avoid dynamic memory allocation for each HMAC computation,
a per-cpu ring buffer is allocated for this purpose.

A new per-interface sysctl called seg6_require_hmac is added, allowing a
user-defined policy for processing HMAC-signed SR-enabled packets.
A value of -1 means that the HMAC field will always be ignored.
A value of 0 means that if an HMAC field is present, its validity will
be enforced (the packet is dropped is the signature is incorrect).
Finally, a value of 1 means that any SR-enabled packet that does not
contain an HMAC signature or whose signature is incorrect will be dropped.
