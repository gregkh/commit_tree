drm/i915/execlists: Reset RING registers upon resume

There is a disparity in the context image saved to disk and our own
bookkeeping - that is we presume the RING_HEAD and RING_TAIL match our
stored ce->ring->tail value. However, as we emit WA_TAIL_DWORDS into the
ring but may not tell the GPU about them, the GPU may be lagging behind
our bookkeeping. Upon hibernation we do not save stolen pages, presuming
that their contents are volatile. This means that although we start
writing into the ring at tail, the GPU starts executing from its HEAD
and there may be some garbage in between and so the GPU promptly hangs
upon resume.
