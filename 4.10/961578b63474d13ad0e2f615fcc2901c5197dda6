bpf: Add percpu LRU list

Instead of having a common LRU list, this patch allows a
percpu LRU list which can be selected by specifying a map
attribute.  The map attribute will be added in the later
patch.

While the common use case for LRU is #reads >> #updates,
percpu LRU list allows bpf prog to absorb unusual #updates
under pathological case (e.g. external traffic facing machine which
could be under attack).

Each percpu LRU is isolated from each other.  The LRU nodes (including
free nodes) cannot be moved across different LRU Lists.

Here are the update performance comparison between
common LRU list and percpu LRU list (the test code is
at the last patch):

[root@kerneltest003.31.prn1 ~]# for i in 1 4 8; do echo -n "$i cpus: "; \
./map_perf_test 16 $i | awk '{r += $3}END{print r " updates"}'; done
 1 cpus: 2934082 updates
 4 cpus: 7391434 updates
 8 cpus: 6500576 updates

[root@kerneltest003.31.prn1 ~]# for i in 1 4 8; do echo -n "$i cpus: "; \
./map_perf_test 32 $i | awk '{r += $3}END{printr " updates"}'; done
  1 cpus: 2896553 updates
  4 cpus: 9766395 updates
  8 cpus: 17460553 updates
