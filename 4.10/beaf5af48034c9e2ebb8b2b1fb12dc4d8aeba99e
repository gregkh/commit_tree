drm/fence: add out-fences support

Support DRM out-fences by creating a sync_file with a fence for each CRTC
that sets the OUT_FENCE_PTR property.

We use the out_fence pointer received in the OUT_FENCE_PTR prop to send
the sync_file fd back to userspace.

The sync_file and fd are allocated/created before commit, but the
fd_install operation only happens after we know that commit succeed.

v2: Comment by Rob Clark:
	- Squash commit that adds DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_OUT_FENCE flag here.

    Comment by Daniel Vetter:
	- Add clean up code for out_fences

v3: Comments by Daniel Vetter:
	- create DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_EVENT_MASK
	- userspace should fill out_fences_ptr with the crtc_ids for which
	it wants fences back.

v4: Create OUT_FENCE_PTR properties and remove old approach.

v5: Comments by Brian Starkey:
	- Remove extra fence_get() in atomic_ioctl()
	- Check ret before iterating on the crtc_state
	- check ret before fd_install
	- set fence_state to NULL at the beginning
	- check fence_state->out_fence_ptr before put_user()
	- change order of fput() and put_unused_fd() on failure

     - Add access_ok() check to the out_fence_ptr received
     - Rebase after fence -> dma_fence rename
     - Store out_fence_ptr in the drm_atomic_state
     - Split crtc_setup_out_fence()
     - return -1 as out_fence with TEST_ONLY flag

v6: Comments by Daniel Vetter
	- Add prepare/unprepare_crtc_signaling()
	- move struct drm_out_fence_state to drm_atomic.c
	- mark get_crtc_fence() as static

    Comments by Brian Starkey
	- proper set fence_ptr fence_state array
	- isolate fence_idx increment

    - improve error handling

v7: Comments by Daniel Vetter
	- remove prefix from internal functions
	- make out_fence_ptr an s64 pointer
	- degrade DRM_INFO to DRM_DEBUG_ATOMIC when put_user fail
	- fix doc issues
	- filter out OUT_FENCE_PTR == NULL and do not fail in this case
	- add complete_crtc_signalling()
	- krealloc fence_state on demand

    Comment by Brian Starkey
	- remove unused crtc_state arg from get_out_fence()

v8: Comment by Brian Starkey
	- cancel events before check for !fence_state
	- convert a few lefovers u64 types for out_fence_ptr
	- fix memleak by assign fence_state earlier after realloc
	- proper accout num_fences in case of error

v9: Comment by Brian Starkey
	- memset last position of fence_state after krealloc
    Comments by Sean Paul
	- pass install_fds in complete_crtc_signaling() instead of ret

     - put_user(-1, fence_ptr) when decoding props

v10: Comment by Brian Starkey
	- remove unneeded num_fences increment on error path
	- kfree fence_state after installing fences fd

v11: rebase against latest drm-misc

v12: rebase again against latest drm-misc
