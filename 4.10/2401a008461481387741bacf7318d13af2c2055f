drm/msm: gpu: Add support for the GPMU

Most 5XX targets have GPMU (Graphics Power Management Unit) that
handles a lot of the heavy lifting for power management including
thermal and limits management and dynamic power collapse. While
the GPMU itself is optional, it is usually nessesary to hit
aggressive power targets.

The GPMU firmware needs to be loaded into the GPMU at init time via a
shared hardware block of registers. Using the GPU to write the microcode
is more efficient than using the CPU so at first load create an indirect
buffer that can be executed during subsequent initalization sequences.

After loading the GPMU gets initalized through a shared register
interface and then we mostly get out of its way and let it do
its thing.
