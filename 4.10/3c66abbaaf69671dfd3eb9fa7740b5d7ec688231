md/r5cache: simplify handling of sh->log_start in recovery

We only need to update sh->log_start at the end of recovery,
which is r5c_recovery_rewrite_data_only_stripes(), so it is not
necessary to set it before that. In this patch, log_start is
removed from r5c_recovery_alloc_stripe().

After updating all sh->log_start, rewrite_data_only_stripes()
also updates log->next_checkpoints to the last sh->log_start.
