btrfs: simplify btrfs_wait_cache_io prototype

With the exception of the one case where btrfs_wait_cache_io is called
without a block group, it's called with the same arguments.  The root
argument is only used in the special case, so let's factor out the core
and simplify the call in the normal case to require a trans, block group,
and path.
