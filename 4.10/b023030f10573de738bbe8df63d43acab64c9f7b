mmc: dw_mmc: The "clock-freq-min-max" property was deprecated

The "clock-freq-min-max" property was deprecated.
There is "max-frequency" property in drivers/mmc/core/host.c
"max-frequency" can be replaced with "clock-freq-min-max".
Minimum clock value might be set to 100K by default.
Then MMC core should try to find the correct value from 400K to 100K.
So it just needs to set Maximum clock value.
