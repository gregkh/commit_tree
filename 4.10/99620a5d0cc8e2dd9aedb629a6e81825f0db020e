perf tools: Introduce timestamp__scnprintf_usec()

Joonwoo reported that there's a mismatch between timestamps in script
and sched commands.  This was because of difference in printing the
timestamp.  Factor out the code and share it so that they can be in
sync.  Also I found that sched map has similar problem, fix it too.

Committer notes:

Fixed the max_lat_at bug introduced by Namhyung's original patch, as
pointed out by Joonwoo, and made it a function following the scnprintf()
model, i.e. returning the number of bytes formatted, and receiving as
the first parameter the object from where the data to the formatting is
obtained, renaming it from:

   char *timestamp_in_usec(char *bf, size_t size, u64 timestamp)

to

   int timestamp__scnprintf_usec(u64 timestamp, char *bf, size_t size)
