net: phy: Avoid deadlock during phy_error()

phy_error() is called in the PHY state machine workqueue context, and
calls phy_trigger_machine() which does a cancel_delayed_work_sync() of
the workqueue we execute from, causing a deadlock situation.

Augment phy_trigger_machine() machine with a sync boolean indicating
whether we should use cancel_*_sync() or just cancel_*_work().
