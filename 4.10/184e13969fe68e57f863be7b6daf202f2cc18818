dmaengine: st_fdma: Update st_fdma to 'depends on REMOTEPROC'.

During randconfig builds you can get the following warning
"warning: (ST_FDMA) selects ST_SLIM_REMOTEPROC which has unmet direct
 dependencies (REMOTEPROC)"

randconfig builds should always build without any warnings so
update fdma to depend on REMOTEPROC so this can not happen.
