x86/tsc: Sync test only for the first cpu in a package

If the TSC_ADJUST MSR is available all CPUs in a package are forced to the
same value. So TSCs cannot be out of sync when the first CPU in the package
was in sync.

That allows to skip the sync test for all CPUs except the first starting
CPU in a package.
