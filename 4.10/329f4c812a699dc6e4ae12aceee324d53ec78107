drm: mark drm_of_component_match_add dummy inline

The newly added drm_of_component_match_add helper is defined as
'static' in a header when CONFIG_OF is disabled, causing a warning
each time the header is included:

In file included from /git/arm-soc/drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/dw-hdmi.c:23:0:
include/drm/drm_of.h:33:13: error: 'drm_of_component_match_add' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

This marks it 'inline' like the other such helpers in this file.
