9p: saner ->write_end() on failing copy into non-uptodate page

If we had a short copy into an uptodate page, there's no reason
whatsoever to zero anything; OTOH, if that page had _not_ been
uptodate, we must have been trying to overwrite it completely
and got a short copy.  In that case, overwriting the end with
zeroes, marking uptodate and sending to server is just plain
wrong.  Just unlock, keep it non-uptodate and return 0.
