Revert "dma-buf/sync-file: Avoid enable fence signaling if poll(.timeout=0)"

This reverts commit ecebca79f6976ddaddfd054d699272515869ea28.

Do not enable fence callback on poll() when using fence_array causes the
fence_array to not signal.

For now we will revert the change and enable signaling everytime time
poll is called with timeout=0 as well.
