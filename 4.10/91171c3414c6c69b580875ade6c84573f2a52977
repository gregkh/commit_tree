staging: lustre: obdclass: fix race during key quiescency

Upon umount, presumably of last device using same OSD back-end,
to prepare for module unload, lu_context_key_quiesce() is run to
remove all module's key reference in any context linked on
lu_context_remembered list.
Threads must protect against such transversal processing when
exiting from its context.
