block: add code to track actual device queue depth

For blk-mq, ->nr_requests does track queue depth, at least at init
time. But for the older queue paths, it's simply a soft setting.
On top of that, it's generally larger than the hardware setting
on purpose, to allow backup of requests for merging.

Fill a hole in struct request with a 'queue_depth' member, that
drivers can call to more closely inform the block layer of the
real queue depth.
