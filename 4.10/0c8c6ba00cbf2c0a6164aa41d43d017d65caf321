pinctrl: sunxi: make bool drivers explicitly non-modular

None of the Kconfigs for any of these drivers are tristate,
meaning that they currently are not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the drivers there is no doubt they are builtin-only.  All
drivers get essentially the same change, so they are handled in batch.

Changes are (1) use builtin_platform_driver, (2) use init.h header
(3) delete module_exit related code, (4) delete MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE,
and (5) delete MODULE_LICENCE/MODULE_AUTHOR and associated tags.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We do delete the MODULE_LICENSE etc. tags since all that information
is already contained at the top of each file in the comments.
