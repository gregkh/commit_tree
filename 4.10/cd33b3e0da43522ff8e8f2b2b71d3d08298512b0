net: phy: bcm63xx: Utilize correct config_intr function

Commit a1cba5613edf ("net: phy: Add Broadcom phy library for common
interfaces") make the BCM63xx PHY driver utilize bcm_phy_config_intr()
which would appear to do the right thing, except that it does not write
to the MII_BCM63XX_IR register but to MII_BCM54XX_ECR which is
different.

This would be causing invalid link parameters and events from being
generated by the PHY interrupt.
