drm/i915: Track pinned vma in intel_plane_state

With atomic plane states we are able to track an allocation right from
preparation, during use and through to the final free after being
swapped out for a new plane. We can couple the VMA we pin for the
framebuffer (and its rotation) to this lifetime and avoid all the clumsy
lookups in between.

v2: Remove residual vma on plane cleanup (Chris)
v3: Add a description for the vma destruction in
    intel_plane_destroy_state (Maarten)
