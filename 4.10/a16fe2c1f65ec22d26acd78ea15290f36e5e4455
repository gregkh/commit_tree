ARM: dts: imx6ul-14x14-evk: add USB dual-role support

With commit 851ce932242d ("usb: chipidea: otg: don't wait vbus
drops below BSV when starts host"), the driver can support
enabling vbus output without software control, so this board
(control vbus output through ID pin) can support dual-role now.
