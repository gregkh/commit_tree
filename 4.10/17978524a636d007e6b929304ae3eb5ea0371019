PCI: hv: Fix hv_pci_remove() for hot-remove

1. We don't really need such a big on-stack buffer when sending the
teardown_packet: vmbus_sendpacket() here only uses sizeof(struct
pci_message).

2. In the hot-remove case (PCI_EJECT), after we send PCI_EJECTION_COMPLETE
to the host, the host will send a RESCIND_CHANNEL message to us and the
host won't access the per-channel ringbuffer any longer, so we needn't send
PCI_RESOURCES_RELEASED/PCI_BUS_D0EXIT to the host, and we shouldn't expect
the host's completion message of PCI_BUS_D0EXIT, which will never come.

3. We should send PCI_BUS_D0EXIT after hv_send_resources_released().
