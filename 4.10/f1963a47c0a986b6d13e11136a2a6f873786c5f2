drm/nouveau/i2c/aux/g94-: retry transactions after hw reports an error

This fixes (works around?) link training failures seen on (at least)
the Lenovo P50's internal panel.

It's also an important fix on the same system for MST support on the
dock.  Sometimes, right after receiving an IRQ from the sink, there's
an error bit (SINKSTAT_ERR) set in the DPAUX registers before we've
even attempted a transaction.

v2. Fixed regression on passive DP->DVI adapters.
