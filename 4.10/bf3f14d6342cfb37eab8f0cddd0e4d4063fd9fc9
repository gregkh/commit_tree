rhashtable: Revert nested table changes.

This reverts commits:

6a25478077d987edc5e2f880590a2bc5fcab4441
9dbbfb0ab6680c6a85609041011484e6658e7d3c
40137906c5f55c252194ef5834130383e639536f

It's too risky to put in this late in the release
cycle.  We'll put these changes into the next merge
window instead.
