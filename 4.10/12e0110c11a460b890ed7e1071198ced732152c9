x86/intel_rdt: Add cpus file

Now we populate each directory with a read/write (mode 0644) file
named "cpus". This is used to over-ride the resources available
to processes in the default resource group when running on specific
CPUs.  Each "cpus" file reads as a cpumask showing which CPUs belong
to this resource group. Initially all online CPUs are assigned to
the default group. They can be added to other groups by writing a
cpumask to the "cpus" file in the directory for the resource group
(which will remove them from the previous group to which they were
assigned). CPU online/offline operations will delete CPUs that go
offline from whatever group they are in and add new CPUs to the
default group.

If there are CPUs assigned to a group when the directory is removed,
they are returned to the default group.
