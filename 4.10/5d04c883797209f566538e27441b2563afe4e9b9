phy_sun4i_usb: set_mode: Allow using set_mode to force end the current session

The sunxi musb has a bug where sometimes it will generate a babble
error on device disconnect instead of a disconnect irq. When this
happens the musb-controller switches from host mode to device mode
(it clears MUSB_DEVCTL_SESSION and sets MUSB_DEVCTL_BDEVICE) and
gets stuck in this state.

Clearing this requires reporting Vbus low for 200 or more ms, but
on some devices Vbus is simply always high (host-only mode, no Vbus
control).

This commit modifies sun4i_usb_phy_set_mode so that it will force
end the current session when called with the current mode, before this
commit calling set_mode with the current mode was a nop since id_det
would stay the same resulting in the detect_work not doing anything.

This allows the sunxi-musb glue to use sun4i_usb_phy_set_mode to force
end the current session without changing the mode, to fixup the stuck
state after a babble error.
