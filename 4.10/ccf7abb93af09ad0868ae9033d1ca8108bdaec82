tcp: avoid infinite loop in tcp_splice_read()

Splicing from TCP socket is vulnerable when a packet with URG flag is
received and stored into receive queue.

__tcp_splice_read() returns 0, and sk_wait_data() immediately
returns since there is the problematic skb in queue.

This is a nice way to burn cpu (aka infinite loop) and trigger
soft lockups.

Again, this gem was found by syzkaller tool.
