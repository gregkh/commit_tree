x86/apic: Prevent tracing on apic_msr_write_eoi()

The following RCU lockdep warning led to adding irq_enter()/irq_exit() into
smp_reschedule_interrupt():

 RCU used illegally from idle CPU!
 rcu_scheduler_active = 1, debug_locks = 0
 RCU used illegally from extended quiescent state!
 no locks held by swapper/1/0.
 
  do_trace_write_msr
  native_write_msr
  native_apic_msr_eoi_write
  smp_reschedule_interrupt
  reschedule_interrupt

As Peterz pointed out:

| So now we're making a very frequent interrupt slower because of debug 
| code.
|
| The thing is, many many smp_reschedule_interrupt() invocations don't
| actually execute anything much at all and are only sent to tickle the
| return to user path (which does the actual preemption).
| 
| Having to do the whole irq_enter/irq_exit dance just for this unlikely
| debug case totally blows.

Use the wrmsr_notrace() variant in native_apic_msr_write_eoi, annotate the
kvm variant with notrace and add a native_apic_eoi callback to the apic
structure so KVM guests are covered as well.

This allows to revert the irq_enter/irq_exit dance in
smp_reschedule_interrupt().
