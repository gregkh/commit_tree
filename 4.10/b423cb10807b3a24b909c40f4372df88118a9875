ipv4: fib: Export free_fib_info()

The FIB notification chain is going to be converted to an atomic chain,
which means switchdev drivers will have to offload FIB entries in
deferred work, as hardware operations entail sleeping.

However, while the work is queued fib info might be freed, so a
reference must be taken. To release the reference (and potentially free
the fib info) fib_info_put() will be called, which in turn calls
free_fib_info().

Export free_fib_info() so that modules will be able to invoke
fib_info_put().
