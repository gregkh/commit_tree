IB/mlx5: Refactor registration to netdev notifier

Refactor the netdev notifier registration into a small helper function.

This is a pre-step towards having mlx5 IB device over an Ethernet port
which doesn't support RoCE. Also, renamed the de-registration helper
and the new helper as netdev notifier and not roce, to make it clear
this is not only used with roce.

This patch doesn't change any functionality.
