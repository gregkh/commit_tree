net: ipv4: Don't crash if passing a null sk to ip_do_redirect.

Commit e2d118a1cb5e ("net: inet: Support UID-based routing in IP
protocols.") made ip_do_redirect call sock_net(sk) to determine
the network namespace of the passed-in socket. This crashes if sk
is NULL.

Fix this by getting the network namespace from the skb instead.
