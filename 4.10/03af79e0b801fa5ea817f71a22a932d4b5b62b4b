drm/i915/gen9+: Use the watermarks from crtc_state for everything, v2.

There's no need to keep a duplicate skl_pipe_wm around any more,
everything can be discovered from crtc_state, which we pass around
correctly now even in case of plane disable.

The copy in intel_crtc->wm.skl.active is equal to
crtc_state->wm.skl.optimal after the atomic commit completes.
It's useful for two-step watermark programming, but not required for
gen9+ which does it in a single step. We can pull the old allocation
from old_crtc_state.
