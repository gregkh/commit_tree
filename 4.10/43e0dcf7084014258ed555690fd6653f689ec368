amd-xgbe: Perform priority-based hardware FIFO allocation

Allocate the FIFO across the hardware Rx queues based on the priority
of the queues.  Giving more FIFO resources to queues with a higher
priority.  If PFC is active but not enabled for a queue, then less
resources can allocated to the queue.
