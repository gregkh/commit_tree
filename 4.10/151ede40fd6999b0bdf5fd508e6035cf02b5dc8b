mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: fix host version for T4240-R1.0-R2.0

The eSDHC of T4240-R1.0-R2.0 has incorrect vender version and spec version.
Acturally the right version numbers should be VVN=0x13 and SVN = 0x1.
This patch adds the GUTS driver support for eSDHC driver to match SoC.
And fix host version to avoid that incorrect version numbers break down
the ADMA data transfer.
