vfio: fix vfio_info_cap_add/shift

Capability header next field is an offset relative to the start of
the INFO buffer. tmp->next is assigned the proper value but iterations
implemented in vfio_info_cap_add and vfio_info_cap_shift use next
as an offset between the headers. When coping with multiple capabilities
this leads to an Oops.
