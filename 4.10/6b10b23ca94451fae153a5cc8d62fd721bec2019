xfs: set AGI buffer type in xlog_recover_clear_agi_bucket

xlog_recover_clear_agi_bucket didn't set the
type to XFS_BLFT_AGI_BUF, so we got a warning during log
replay (or an ASSERT on a debug build).

    XFS (md0): Unknown buffer type 0!
    XFS (md0): _xfs_buf_ioapply: no ops on block 0xaea8802/0x1

Fix this, as was done in f19b872b for 2 other locations
with the same problem.
