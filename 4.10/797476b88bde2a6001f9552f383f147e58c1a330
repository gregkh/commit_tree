block: Add 'zoned' queue limit

Add the zoned queue limit to indicate the zoning model of a block device.
Defined values are 0 (BLK_ZONED_NONE) for regular block devices,
1 (BLK_ZONED_HA) for host-aware zone block devices and 2 (BLK_ZONED_HM)
for host-managed zone block devices. The standards defined drive managed
model is not defined here since these block devices do not provide any
command for accessing zone information. Drive managed model devices will
be reported as BLK_ZONED_NONE.

The helper functions blk_queue_zoned_model and bdev_zoned_model return
the zoned limit and the functions blk_queue_is_zoned and bdev_is_zoned
return a boolean for callers to test if a block device is zoned.

The zoned attribute is also exported as a string to applications via
sysfs. BLK_ZONED_NONE shows as "none", BLK_ZONED_HA as "host-aware" and
BLK_ZONED_HM as "host-managed".
