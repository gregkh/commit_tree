Btrfs: fix qgroup rescan worker initialization

We were setting the qgroup_rescan_running flag to true only after the
rescan worker started (which is a task run by a queue). So if a user
space task starts a rescan and immediately after asks to wait for the
rescan worker to finish, this second call might happen before the rescan
worker task starts running, in which case the rescan wait ioctl returns
immediatley, not waiting for the rescan worker to finish.

This was making the fstest btrfs/022 fail very often.

Fixes: d2c609b834d6 (btrfs: properly track when rescan worker is running)
