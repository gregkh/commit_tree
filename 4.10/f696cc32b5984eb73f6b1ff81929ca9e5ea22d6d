scsi: hisi_sas: use atomic64_t for hisi_sas_device.running_req

Sometimes the value of hisi_sas_device.running_req
would go negative unless we have the check for
running_req >= 0 before trying to decrement.

This is because using running_req is not thread-safe.

As such, the value for running_req may be actually incorrect,
so use atomic64_t instead.
