mmc: dw_mmc: exynos: fix to call suspend callback

The dw_mmc-exynos should be RPM_ACTIVE on probe() to call suspend
callback of runtime PM in pm_runtime_force_suspend() during first system
suspend. Also call pm_runtime_get_noresume() on probe() because it
doesn't call suspend/resume callback by runtime PM now.
