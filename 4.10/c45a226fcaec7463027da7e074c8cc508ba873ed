staging: iio: tsl2583: add copyright and MODULE_AUTHOR

Add Brian Masney's copyright to the header and to the MODULE_AUTHOR
for all of the staging cleanups that has been done to this driver.

The original MODULE_AUTHOR() did not have a space between his name and
email address. This patch also adds the missing space.
