netfilter: nf_tables: validate the name size when possible

Currently, if the user add a stateful object with the name size exceed
NFT_OBJ_MAXNAMELEN - 1 (i.e. 31), we truncate it down to 31 silently.
This is not friendly, furthermore, this will cause duplicated stateful
objects when the first 31 characters of the name is same. So limit the
stateful object's name size to NFT_OBJ_MAXNAMELEN - 1.

After apply this patch, error message will be printed out like this:
  # name_32=$(printf "%0.sQ" {1..32})
  # nft add counter filter $name_32
  <cmdline>:1:1-52: Error: Could not process rule: Numerical result out
  of range
  add counter filter QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Also this patch cleans up the codes which missing the name size limit
validation in nftables.
