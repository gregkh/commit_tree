gpu: host1x: Store device address to all bufs

Currently job pinning is optimized to handle only the first buffer
using a certain host1x_bo object and all subsequent buffers using
the same host1x_bo are considered done.

In most cases this is correct, however, in case the same host1x_bo
is used in multiple gathers inside the same job, we skip also
storing the device address (physical or iova) to this buffer.

This patch reworks the host1x_job_pin() to store the device address
to all gathers.
