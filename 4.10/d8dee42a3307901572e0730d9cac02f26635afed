drm/i915: Switch to using port stored in intel_encoder

Now that we have the port enum stored in intel_encoder, use that instead of
dereferencing intel_dig_port. Saves us a few locals.

struct intel_encoder variables have been renamed to be consistent and
convey type information.

v2:
Fix incorrect 'enum port' member names - s/attached_port/port
