clean_bdev_aliases: Prevent cleaning blocks that are not in block range

The first block to be cleaned may start at a non-zero page offset. In
such a scenario clean_bdev_aliases() will end up cleaning blocks that
do not fall in the range of blocks to be cleaned. This commit fixes the
issue by skipping blocks that do not fall in valid block range.
