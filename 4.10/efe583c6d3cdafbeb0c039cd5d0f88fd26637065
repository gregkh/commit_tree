scsi: lpfc: Use %zd format string for size_t

A recent bugfix introduced a harmless warning in the lpfc driver:

drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c: In function 'lpfc_write_firmware':
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_logmsg.h:56:45: error: format '%ld' expects argument of type 'long int', but argument 9 has type 'size_t {aka const unsigned int}' [-Werror=format=]

'size_t' is always the same width as 'long' in the kernel, but the
compiler doesn't know that. The %z modifier is what the standard expects
to be used here, and this shuts up the warning.
