powerpc: Fix __cmpxchg() to take a volatile ptr again

In commit d0563a1297e2 ("powerpc: Implement {cmp}xchg for u8 and u16")
we removed the volatile from __cmpxchg().

This is leading to warnings such as:

  drivers/gpu/drm/drm_lock.c: In function ‘drm_lock_take’:
  arch/powerpc/include/asm/cmpxchg.h:484:37: warning: passing argument 1
  of ‘__cmpxchg’ discards ‘volatile’ qualifier from pointer target
     (__typeof__(*(ptr))) __cmpxchg((ptr), (unsigned long)_o_,   \

There doesn't seem to be consensus across architectures whether the
argument is volatile or not, so at least for now put the volatile back.
