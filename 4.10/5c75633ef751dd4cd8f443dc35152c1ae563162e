USB: serial: mos7840: fix NULL-deref at open

Fix NULL-pointer dereference in open() should the device lack the
expected endpoints:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000030
...
PC is at mos7840_open+0x88/0x8dc [mos7840]

Note that we continue to treat the interrupt-in endpoint as optional for
now.
