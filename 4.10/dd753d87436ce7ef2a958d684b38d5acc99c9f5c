IB/rxe: Advance the consumer pointer before posting the CQE

A simple userspace application might poll the CQ, find a completion,
and then attempt to post a new WQE to the SQ. A spurious error can
occur if the userspace application detects a full SQ in the instant
before the kernel is able to advance the SQ consumer pointer.

This is noticeable when using single-entry SQs with ibv_rc_pingpong
if lots of kernel and userspace library debugging is enabled.
