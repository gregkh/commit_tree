drm/i915: Introduce a global_seqno for each request

Though we will have multiple timelines, we still have a single timeline
of execution. This we can use to provide an execution and retirement order
of requests. This keeps tracking execution of requests simple, and vital
for preserving a single waiter (i.e. so that we can order the waiters so
that only the earliest to wakeup need be woken). To accomplish this we
distinguish the seqno used to order requests per-context (external) and
that used internally for execution.
