staging: lustre: remove broken dead code in cfs_cpt_table_create_pattern

After a recent bugfix, we get a warning about the use of an uninitialized
variable:

drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/libcfs/linux/linux-cpu.c: In function 'cfs_cpt_table_create_pattern':
drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/libcfs/linux/linux-cpu.c:833:7: error: 'str' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This part of the function used to not do anything as we would reassign
the 'str' pointer to something else right away, but now we pass an
uninitialized pointer into 'strchr', which can cause a kernel page fault
or worse.
