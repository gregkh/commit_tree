qla2xxx: Fix crash due to null pointer access

During code inspection, while investigating following stack trace
seen on one of the test setup, we found out there was possibility
of memory leak becuase driver was not unwinding the stack properly.

This issue has not been reproduced in a test environment or on a
customer setup.

Here's stack trace that was seen.
