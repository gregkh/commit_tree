Documentation: net: phy: improve explanation when to specify the PHY ID

The old description basically read like "ethernet-phy-idAAAA.BBBB" can
be specified when you know the actual PHY ID. However, specifying this
has a side-effect: it forces Linux to bind to a certain PHY driver (the
one that matches the ID given in the compatible string), ignoring the ID
which is reported by the actual PHY.
Whenever a device is shipped with (multiple) different PHYs during it's
production lifetime then explicitly specifying
"ethernet-phy-idAAAA.BBBB" could break certain revisions of that device.
