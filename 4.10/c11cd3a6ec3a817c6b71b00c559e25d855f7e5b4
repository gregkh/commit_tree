net: filter: run cgroup eBPF ingress programs

If the cgroup associated with the receiving socket has an eBPF
programs installed, run them from sk_filter_trim_cap().

eBPF programs used in this context are expected to either return 1 to
let the packet pass, or != 1 to drop them. The programs have access to
the skb through bpf_skb_load_bytes(), and the payload starts at the
network headers (L3).

Note that cgroup_bpf_run_filter() is stubbed out as static inline nop
for !CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF, and is otherwise guarded by a static key if
the feature is unused.
