md/r5cache: do r5c_update_log_state after log recovery

We should update log state after we did a log recovery, current completion
may get wrong log state since log->log_start wasn't initalized until we
called r5l_recovery_log.

At log recovery stage, no lock needed as there is no race conditon.
next_checkpoint field will be initialized in r5l_recovery_log too.
