drm/i915: Clean up DDI DDC/AUX CH sanitation

Now that we use the AUX and GMBUS assignment from VBT for all ports,
let's clean up the sanitization of the port information a bit.
Previosuly we only did this for port E, and only complained about a
non-standard assignment for the other ports. But as we know that
non-standard assignments are a fact of life, let's expand the
sanitization to all the ports.

v2: Include a commit message, fix up the comments a bit
v3: Don't clobber other ports if the current port has no alternate aux ch/ddc pin
