parisc: Optimize timer interrupt function

Restructure the timer interrupt function to better cope with missed timer irqs.
Optimize the calculation when the next interrupt should happen and skip irqs if
they would happen too shortly after exit of the irq function.

The update_process_times() call is done anyway at every timer irq, so we can
safely drop the prof_counter and prof_multiplier variables from the per_cpu
structure.
