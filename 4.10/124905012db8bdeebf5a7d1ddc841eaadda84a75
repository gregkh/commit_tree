i40e: replace PTP Rx timestamp hang logic

The current Rx timestamp hang logic is not very robust because it does
not notice a register is hung until all four timestamps have been
latched and we wait a full 5 seconds. Replace this logic with a newer Rx
hang detection based on storing the jiffies when we first notice
a receive timestamp event. We store each register's time separately,
along with a flag indicating if it is currently latched. Upon first
transitioning to latch, we will update the latch_events[i] jiffies
value. This indicates the time we first noticed this event. The watchdog
routine will simply check that the either the flag has been cleared, or
we have passed at least one second. In this case, it is able to clear
the Rx timestamp register under the assumption that it was for a dropped
frame. The benefit if this strategy is that we should be able to
detect and clear out stalled RXTIME_H registers before we exhaust the
supply of 4, and avoid complete stall of Rx timestamp events.
