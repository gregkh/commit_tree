d86e64768859, an error in the edit results in the wrong firmware
being loaded for some models of the RTL8188/8192CE. In this condition,
the connection suffered from high ping latency, slow transfer rates,
 and required higher signal strengths to work at all

See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=853073,
