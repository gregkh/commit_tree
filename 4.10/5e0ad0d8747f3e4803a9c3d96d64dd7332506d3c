ALSA: hda: when comparing pin configurations, ignore assoc in addition to seq

Commit [64047d7f4912 ALSA: hda - ignore the assoc and seq when comparing
pin configurations] intented to ignore both seq and assoc at pin
comparing, but it only ignored seq. So that commit may still fail to
match pins on some machines.
Change the bitmask to also ignore assoc.

v2: Use macro to do bit masking.

Thanks to Hui Wang for the analysis.
