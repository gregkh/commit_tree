powerpc: Fix build failure with clang due to BUILD_BUG_ON()

Anton says: In commit 4db7327194db ("powerpc: Add option to use jump
label for cpu_has_feature()") and commit c12e6f24d413 ("powerpc: Add
option to use jump label for mmu_has_feature()") we added:

  BUILD_BUG_ON(!__builtin_constant_p(feature))

to cpu_has_feature() and mmu_has_feature() in order to catch usage
issues (such as cpu_has_feature(cpu_has_feature(X), which has happened
once in the past). Unfortunately LLVM isn't smart enough to resolve
this, and it errors out.

I work around it in my clang/LLVM builds of the kernel, but I have just
discovered that it causes a lot of issues for the bcc (eBPF) trace tool
(which uses LLVM).

For now just #ifdef it away for clang builds.
