powerpc/icp-opal: Fix missing KVM case and harden replay

The icp-opal call is missing the code from icp-native to recover
interrupts snatched by KVM. Without that, when running KVM, we can
get into a situation where an interrupt is lost and the CPU stuck
with an elevated CPPR.

Also harden replay by always checking the return from opal_int_eoi().
