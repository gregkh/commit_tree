packet: round up linear to header len

Link layer protocols may unconditionally pull headers, as Ethernet
does in eth_type_trans. Ensure that the entire link layer header
always lies in the skb linear segment. tpacket_snd has such a check.
Extend this to packet_snd.

Variable length link layer headers complicate the computation
somewhat. Here skb->len may be smaller than dev->hard_header_len.

Round up the linear length to be at least as long as the smallest of
the two.
