scsi: ncr5380: Increase register polling limit

If NCR5380_poll_politely() is called under irq lock, the polling time
limit is clamped to avoid a spike in interrupt latency. When not under
irq lock, the same polling time limit acts as the worst case delay
between schedule() calls.

During PDMA (under irq lock) I've found that the 10 ms time limit is
sometimes too short, and leads to the error message,
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] tag#1 macscsi_pread: !REQ and !ACK

This particular target identifies itself as a QUANTUM DAYTONA514S. It
seems to be slower to assert ACK than the other targets I've tested.
This patch solves the problem by increasing the polling timeout.
