sdhci: sdhci-msm: update dll configuration

The newer msm sdhci's cores use a different DLL hardware for HS400.
Update the configuration and calibration of the newer DLL block.

The HS400 DLL block used previously is CDC LP 533 and requires
programming multiple registers and waiting for configuration to
complete and then enable it. It has about 18 register writes and
two register reads.

The newer HS400 DLL block is SDC4 DLL and requires two register
writes for configuration and one register read to confirm that it
is initialized. There is an additional register write to enable
the power save mode for SDC4 DLL block.
