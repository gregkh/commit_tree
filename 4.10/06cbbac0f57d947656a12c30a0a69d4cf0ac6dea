x86/build: Don't use $(LINUXINCLUDE) twice

The make variable KBUILD_CFLAGS contains $(LINUXINCLUDE). But the build
already picks up $(LINUXINCLUDE) from scripts/Makefile.lib. The net effect
is that the (long) list of include directories is used twice.

This is harmless but pointless. So stop using $(LINUXINCLUDE) twice.
