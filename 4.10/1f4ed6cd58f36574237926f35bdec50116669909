[media] dvbdev: split dvb_unregister_device()

dvb_unregister_device() has a major problem: it combines unregistering
with memory disposal.  Sometimes, it is necessary to unregister a
device, but no memory can be freed yet, because a process still has a
(stale) file handle.  Therefore, we need to split
dvb_unregister_device().  This will allow sanitizing a few callers.

With my new design, dvb_unregister_device() appears misnamed, but to
reduce patch noise, I'm not renaming it just yet.
