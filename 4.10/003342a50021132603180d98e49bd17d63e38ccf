drm/i915: Keep track of active forcewake domains in a bitmask

There are current places in the code, and there will be more in the
future, which iterate the forcewake domains to find out which ones
are currently active.

To save them from doing this iteration, we can cheaply keep a mask
of active domains in dev_priv->uncore.fw_domains_active.

This has no cost in terms of object size, even manages to shrink it
overall by 368 bytes on my config.
