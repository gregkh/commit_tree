iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Use const and __initconst for iommu_gather_ops structures

Check for iommu_gather_ops structures that are only stored in the tlb
field of an io_pgtable_cfg structure. The tlb field is of type
const struct iommu_gather_ops *, so iommu_gather_ops structures
having this property can be declared as const. Also, replace __initdata
with __initconst.
