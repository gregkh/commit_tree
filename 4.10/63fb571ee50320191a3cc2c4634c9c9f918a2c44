net: atheros: atl1e: use new api ethtool_{get|set}_link_ksettings

The ethtool api {get|set}_settings is deprecated.
We move this driver to new api {get|set}_link_ksettings.

The previous implementation of set_settings was modifying
the value of advertising, but with the new API, it's not
possible. The structure ethtool_link_ksettings is defined
as const.
