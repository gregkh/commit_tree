mailbox: bcm-pdc: Simplify interrupt handler logic

Earlier versions of the PDC driver registered for both
transmit and receive interrupts. The hard IRQ handler had to
communicate to the soft handler which interrupt(s) had occurred.
The PDC driver no longer registers for tx interrupts. So there is
no reason to save the intstatus. So remove the intstatus member
of the PDC state.
