ipv6: sr: add code base for control plane support of SR-IPv6

This patch adds the necessary hooks and structures to provide support
for SR-IPv6 control plane, essentially the Generic Netlink commands
that will be used for userspace control over the Segment Routing
kernel structures.

The genetlink commands provide control over two different structures:
tunnel source and HMAC data. The tunnel source is the source address
that will be used by default when encapsulating packets into an
outer IPv6 header + SRH. If the tunnel source is set to :: then an
address of the outgoing interface will be selected as the source.

The HMAC commands currently just return ENOTSUPP and will be implemented
in a future patch.
