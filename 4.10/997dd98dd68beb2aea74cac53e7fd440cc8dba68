mm: move part of wp_page_reuse() into the single call site

wp_page_reuse() handles write shared faults which is needed only in
wp_page_shared().  Move the handling only into that location to make
wp_page_reuse() simpler and avoid a strange situation when we sometimes
pass in locked page, sometimes unlocked etc.
