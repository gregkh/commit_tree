be2net: fix accesses to unicast list

Commit 988d44b "be2net: Avoid redundant addition of mac address in HW"
introduced be_dev_mac_add & be_uc_mac_add helpers that incorrectly
access adapter->uc_list as an array of bytes instead of an array of
be_eth_addr. Consequently NIC is not filled with valid data so unicast
filtering is broken.
