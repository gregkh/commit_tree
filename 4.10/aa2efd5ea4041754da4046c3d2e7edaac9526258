mm/slub.c: trace free objects at KERN_INFO

Currently when trace is enabled (e.g.  slub_debug=T,kmalloc-128 ) the
trace messages are mostly output at KERN_INFO.  However the trace code
also calls print_section() to hexdump the head of a free object.  This
is hard coded to use KERN_ERR, meaning the console is deluged with trace
messages even if we've asked for quiet.

Fix this the obvious way but adding a level parameter to
print_section(), allowing calls from the trace code to use the same
trace level as other trace messages.
