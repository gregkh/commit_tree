macvtap: read vnet_hdr_size once

When IFF_VNET_HDR is enabled, a virtio_net header must precede data.
Data length is verified to be greater than or equal to expected header
length tun->vnet_hdr_sz before copying.

Macvtap functions read the value once, but unless READ_ONCE is used,
the compiler may ignore this and read multiple times. Enforce a single
read and locally cached value to avoid updates between test and use.
