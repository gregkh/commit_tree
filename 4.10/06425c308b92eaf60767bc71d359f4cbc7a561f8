tcp: fix 0 divide in __tcp_select_window()

syszkaller fuzzer was able to trigger a divide by zero, when
TCP window scaling is not enabled.

SO_RCVBUF can be used not only to increase sk_rcvbuf, also
to decrease it below current receive buffers utilization.

If mss is negative or 0, just return a zero TCP window.
