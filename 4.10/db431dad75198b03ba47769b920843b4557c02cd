staging: lustre: osc: fix bug when setting max_pages_per_rpc

After setting like "lctl set_param -P osc.*.max_pages_per_rpc", it
is possible that the function osc_obd_max_pages_per_rpc_seq_write
will be called before ocd_brw_size has been set when mount.
ocd_brw_size is meaningless when it is zero. So it should not be
the limit at that time.
