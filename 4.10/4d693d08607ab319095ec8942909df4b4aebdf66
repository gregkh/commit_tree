lib: radix-tree: update callback for changing leaf nodes

Support handing __radix_tree_replace() a callback that gets invoked for
all leaf nodes that change or get freed as a result of the slot
replacement, to assist users tracking nodes with node->private_list.

This prepares for putting page cache shadow entries into the radix tree
root again and drastically simplifying the shadow tracking.
