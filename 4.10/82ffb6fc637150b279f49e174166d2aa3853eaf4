ALSA: usb-audio: Add QuickCam Communicate Deluxe/S7500 to volume_control_quirks

The Logitech QuickCam Communicate Deluxe/S7500 microphone fails with the
following warning.

[    6.778995] usb 2-1.2.2.2: Warning! Unlikely big volume range (=3072),
cval->res is probably wrong.
[    6.778996] usb 2-1.2.2.2: [5] FU [Mic Capture Volume] ch = 1, val =
4608/7680/1

Adding it to the list of devices in volume_control_quirks makes it work
properly, fixing related typo.
