PCI: Add MCFG quirks for Cavium ThunderX pass1.x host controller

ThunderX pass1.x requires to emulate the EA headers for on-chip devices
hence it has to use custom pci_thunder_ecam_ops for accessing PCI config
space (pci-thunder-ecam.c). Add new entries to MCFG quirk array where it
can be applied while probing ACPI based PCI host controller.

ThunderX pass1.x is using the same way for accessing off-chip devices
(so-called PEM) as silicon pass-2.x so we need to add PEM quirk entries
too.

Quirk is considered for ThunderX silicon pass1.x only which is identified
via MCFG revision 2.

ThunderX pass 1.x requires the following accessors:

  NUMA node 0 PCI segments  0- 3: pci_thunder_ecam_ops (MCFG quirk)
  NUMA node 0 PCI segments  4- 9: thunder_pem_ecam_ops (MCFG quirk)
  NUMA node 1 PCI segments 10-13: pci_thunder_ecam_ops (MCFG quirk)
  NUMA node 1 PCI segments 14-19: thunder_pem_ecam_ops (MCFG quirk)
