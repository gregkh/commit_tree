PM / runtime: Optimize the use of device links

If the device has no links to suppliers that should be used for
runtime PM (links with DEVICE_LINK_PM_RUNTIME set), there is no
reason to walk the list of suppliers for that device during
runtime suspend and resume.

Add a simple mechanism to detect that case and possibly avoid the
extra unnecessary overhead.
