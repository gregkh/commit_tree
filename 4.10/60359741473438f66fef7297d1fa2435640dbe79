autofs: use path_has_submounts() to fix unreliable have_submount() checks

If an automount mount is clone(2)ed into a file system that is propagation
private, when it later expires in the originating namespace, subsequent
calls to autofs ->d_automount() for that dentry in the original namespace
will return ELOOP until the mount is umounted in the cloned namespace.

Now that a struct path is available where needed use path_has_submounts()
instead of have_submounts() so we don't get false positives when checking
if a dentry is a mount point or contains mounts in the current namespace.
