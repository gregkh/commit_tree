drm/i915: Allow i915_sw_fence_await_sw_fence() to allocate

In forthcoming patches, we want to be able to dynamically allocate the
wait_queue_t used whilst awaiting. This is more convenient if we extend
the i915_sw_fence_await_sw_fence() to perform the allocation for us if
we pass in a gfp mask as an alternative than a preallocated struct.
