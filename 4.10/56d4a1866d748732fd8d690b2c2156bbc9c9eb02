scsi: ufs: add quirk to increase host PA_SaveConfigTime

The maximum value PA_SaveConfigTime is 250 (10us) but this is not enough
for some vendors. Gear switch from PWM to HS may fail even with this
max.  PA_SaveConfigTime. Gear switch can be issued by host controller as
an error recovery and any software delay will not help on this case so
we need to increase PA_SaveConfigTime to >32us as per vendor
recommendation.  This change adds a quirk to increase the
PA_SaveConfigTime parameter.
