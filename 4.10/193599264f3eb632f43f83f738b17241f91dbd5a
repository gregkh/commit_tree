ASoC: simple-scu-card: code sync: tidyup props/link naming

simple sound card family are using very similar style, but because of its
historical reason, there are small differences. For example pointer style,
function name, caller postion etc...
This patch synchronizes style to other simple card family so that be enable
to easy reviewing.

This patch uses dai_link/dai_props instead of links/props.
