[media] media: ti-vpe: vpdma: RGB data type yield inverted data

The VPDMA RGB data type definition have been updated
to match with Errata i839.

But some of the ARGB definition appeared to be wrong
in the document also. As they would yield RGBA instead.
They have been corrected based on experimentation.
