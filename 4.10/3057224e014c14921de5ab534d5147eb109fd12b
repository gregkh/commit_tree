mlxsw: spectrum_router: Implement FIB offload in deferred work

FIB offload is currently done in process context with RTNL held, but
we're about to dump the FIB tables in RCU critical section, so we can no
longer sleep.

Instead, defer the operation to process context using deferred work. Make
sure fib info isn't freed while the work is queued by taking a reference
on it and releasing it after the operation is done.

Deferring the operation is valid because the upper layers always assume
the operation was successful. If it's not, then the driver-specific
abort mechanism is called and all routed traffic is directed to slow
path.

The work items are submitted to an ordered workqueue to prevent a
mismatch between the kernel's FIB table and the device's.
