md/r5cache: handle FLUSH and FUA

With raid5 cache, we committing data from journal device. When
there is flush request, we need to flush journal device's cache.
This was not needed in raid5 journal, because we will flush the
journal before committing data to raid disks.

This is similar to FUA, except that we also need flush journal for
FUA. Otherwise, corruptions in earlier meta data will stop recovery
from reaching FUA data.
