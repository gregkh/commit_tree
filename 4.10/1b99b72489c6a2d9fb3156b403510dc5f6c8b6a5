drm/fb-helper: fix segfaults in drm_fb_helper_debug_*

A drm driver that is implementing

      fb_debug_enter and fb_debug_leave

in struct fb_ops with drm fb helper functions

     drm_fb_helper_debug_enter and drm_fb_helper_debug_leave

must also implement the callback 'mode_set_base_atomic' in struct
drm_crtc_helper_funcs. See Documentation/DocBook/kgdb.tmpl.  The current
implementation will segfault when 'mode_set_base_atomic' is a NULL
pointer.

Before this patch at least the drm drivers armada, ast, qxl, udl and
virtio do not have a 'mode_set_base_atomic' implementation but using
drm_fb_helper_debug_(enter|leave). So these drivers may segfault when
callbacks fb_debug_(enter|leave) are called.

Avoid the issue by just checking for NULL pointers. So all drivers can
unconditionally implement fb_debug_(enter|leave) with the drm_fb_helper
functions. If callback 'mode_set_base_atomic' is not implemented, the
code in drm_fb_helper_debug_(enter|leave) does effectively nothing.
