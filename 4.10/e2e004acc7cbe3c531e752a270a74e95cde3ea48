xen-netfront: Improve error handling during initialization

This fixes a crash when running out of grant refs when creating many
queues across many netdevs.

* If creating queues fails (i.e. there are no grant refs available),
call xenbus_dev_fatal() to ensure that the xenbus device is set to the
closed state.
* If no queues are created, don't call xennet_disconnect_backend as
netdev->real_num_tx_queues will not have been set correctly.
* If setup_netfront() fails, ensure that all the queues created are
cleaned up, not just those that have been set up.
* If any queues were set up and an error occurs, call
xennet_destroy_queues() to clean up the napi context.
* If any fatal error occurs, unregister and destroy the netdev to avoid
leaving around a half setup network device.
