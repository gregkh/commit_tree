ACPI / gpio: Allow holes in list of GPIOs for a device

Make it possible to have an empty GPIOs in a GPIO list for device. For
example a SPI master may use both GPIOs and native pins as chip selects and
we need to be able to distinguish between the two.

This makes it mandatory to have exactly 3 arguments for GPIOs and then
converts gpiolib to use of __acpi_node_get_property_reference() instead. In
addition we make acpi_gpio_package_count() to handle holes as well (this
matches the DT version).
