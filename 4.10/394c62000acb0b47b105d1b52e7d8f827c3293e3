remoteproc/ste: Delete unused driver

Back in July 2014 I asked around what was the intended target
platform for the STE Modem remoteproc driver, so that I could add the
proper hardware dependency to its config option. The answer I got was
that there was no known publicly available hardware needing it and it
was unlikely that there ever would.

So I think it's time to delete this driver to lower the maintenance
burden.
