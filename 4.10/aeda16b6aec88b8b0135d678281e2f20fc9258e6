tipc: rename tsk->remote to tsk->peer for consistent naming

Until now, the peer information for connect is stored in tsk->remote
but the rest of code uses the name peer for peer/remote.

In this commit, we rename tsk->remote to tsk->peer to align with
naming convention followed in the rest of the code.

There is no functional change in this commit.
