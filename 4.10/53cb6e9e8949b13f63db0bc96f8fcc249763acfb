i40e: Removal of workaround for simple MAC address filter deletion

This is code refactoring. This patch removes the workaround which deleted
a default MAC filter added by the firmware when the interface was brought
up. This filter caused frames to pass disregarding the VLAN tagging.
It used to be automatically applied after reset in pre-SRA FW versions.
This workaround is not needed in production NICs and hence can be removed.
