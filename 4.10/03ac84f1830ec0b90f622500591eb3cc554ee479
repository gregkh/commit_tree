drm/i915: Pass around sg_table to get_pages/put_pages backend

The plan is to move obj->pages out from under the struct_mutex into its
own per-object lock. We need to prune any assumption of the struct_mutex
from the get_pages/put_pages backends, and to make it easier we pass
around the sg_table to operate on rather than indirectly via the obj.
