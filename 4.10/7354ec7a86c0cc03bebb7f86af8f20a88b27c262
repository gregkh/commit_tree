perf jit: Make perf skip unknown records

The behavior before this commit was to skip the remaining portion of the
jitdump in case an unknown record was found, including those records
that perf could handle.

With this change, parsing a record with an unknown id will cause a
warning to be emitted, the record will be skipped and parsing will
resume from the next (valid) one.

The patch aims at making perf more future proof, by extracting as much
information as possible from jitdumps.
