drm/i915: Support asynchronous waits on struct fence from i915_gem_request

We will need to wait on DMA completion (as signaled via struct fence)
before executing our i915_gem_request. Therefore we want to expose a
method for adding the await on the fence itself to the request.

v2: Add a comment detailing a failure to handle a signal-on-any
fence-array.
v3: Pretend that magic numbers don't exist.
