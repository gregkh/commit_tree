net: ipv4: Fix multipath selection with vrf

fib_select_path does not call fib_select_multipath if oif is set in the
flow struct. For VRF use cases oif is always set, so multipath route
selection is bypassed. Use the FLOWI_FLAG_SKIP_NH_OIF to skip the oif
check similar to what is done in fib_table_lookup.

Add saddr and proto to the flow struct for the fib lookup done by the
VRF driver to better match hash computation for a flow.

Fixes: 613d09b30f8b ("net: Use VRF device index for lookups on TX")
