s390/lib: add missing memory barriers to string inline assemblies

We have a couple of inline assemblies like memchr() and strlen() that
read from memory, but tell the compiler only they need the addresses
of the strings they access.
This allows the compiler to omit the initialization of such strings
and therefore generate broken code. Add the missing memory barrier to
all string related inline assemblies to fix this potential issue. It
looks like the compiler currently does not generate broken code due to
these bugs.
