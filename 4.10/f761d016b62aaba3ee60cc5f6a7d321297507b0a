staging: lustre: lov: init LOV stripe type beforehand

When lu_object_alloc() reaches to LOV object init, we need initialize
its stripe type beforehand, so that if something wrong in the conf
buffer, the object chain need to be traversed to free what has been
allocated, with LOV object type be set as LLT_EMPTY, and when the LOV
part is reached, it won't panic without knowing what stripe type it
is.

This patch also improves debug messages in lsm_unpackmd_common(), and
does not return error if the LOV device is still processing config
log while trying to verify a layout buffer.
