fs: configfs: don't return anything from drop_link

Documentation/filesystems/configfs/configfs.txt says:

"When unlink(2) is called on the symbolic link, the source item is
notified via the ->drop_link() method.  Like the ->drop_item() method,
this is a void function and cannot return failure."

The ->drop_item() is indeed a void function, the ->drop_link() is
actually not. This, together with the fact that the value of ->drop_link()
is silently ignored suggests, that it is the ->drop_link() return
type that should be corrected and changed to void.

This patch changes drop_link() signature and all its users.
