tools/power turbostat: Allocate correct amount of fd and irq entries

The tool uses topo.max_cpu_num to determine number of entries needed for
fd_percpu[] and irqs_per_cpu[]. For example on a system with 4 CPUs
topo.max_cpu_num is 3 so we get too small array for holding per-CPU items.

Fix this to use right number of entries, which is topo.max_cpu_num + 1.
