net/mlx4_en: Refactor the XDP forwarding rings scheme

Separately manage the two types of TX rings: regular ones, and XDP.
Upon an XDP set, do not borrow regular TX rings and convert them
into XDP ones, but allocate new ones, unless we hit the max number
of rings.
Which means that in systems with smaller #cores we will not consume
the current TX rings for XDP, while we are still in the num TX limit.

XDP TX rings counters are not shown in ethtool statistics.
Instead, XDP counters will be added to the respective RX rings
in a downstream patch.

This has no performance implications.
