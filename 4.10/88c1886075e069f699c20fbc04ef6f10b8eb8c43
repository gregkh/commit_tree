ASoC: arizona: Call arizona_init_notifiers for all CODECs

The call to arizona_init_notifiers was only added for CODECs that are
generating voice trigger events, however, this is somewhat annoying
for machine drivers that might be used with multiple CODECs as they
need to conditionally register for the notifier, depending on the
CODEC being attached.

As the cost of initialising the notifier is so minimal, and we may
well add other events in the future that apply to more CODECs, simply
do this for all Arizona CODECs.
