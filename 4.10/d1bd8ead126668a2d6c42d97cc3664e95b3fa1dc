kdb: remove unused kdb_event handling

kdb_event state variable is only set but never checked in the kernel
code.

http://www.spinics.net/lists/kdb/msg01733.html suggests that this
variable affected WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED() in the original
implementation.  But this check never went upstream.

The semantic is unclear and racy.  The value is updated after the
kdb_printf_lock is acquired and after it is released.  It should be
symmetric at minimum.  The value should be manipulated either inside or
outside the locked area.

Fortunately, it seems that the original function is gone and we could
simply remove the state variable.
