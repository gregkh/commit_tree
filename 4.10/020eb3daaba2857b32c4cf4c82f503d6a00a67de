x86/ioapic: Restore IO-APIC irq_chip retrigger callback

commit d32932d02e18 removed the irq_retrigger callback from the IO-APIC
chip and did not add it to the new IO-APIC-IR irq chip.

Unfortunately the software resend fallback is not enabled on X86, so edge
interrupts which are received during the lazy disabled state of the
interrupt line are not retriggered and therefor lost.

Restore the callbacks.
