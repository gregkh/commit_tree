ipv6 addrconf: Implemented enhanced DAD (RFC7527)

Implemented RFC7527 Enhanced DAD.
IPv6 duplicate address detection can fail if there is some temporary
loopback of Ethernet frames. RFC7527 solves this by including a random
nonce in the NS messages used for DAD, and if an NS is received with the
same nonce it is assumed to be a looped back DAD probe and is ignored.
RFC7527 is enabled by default. Can be disabled by setting both of
conf/{all,interface}/enhanced_dad to zero.
