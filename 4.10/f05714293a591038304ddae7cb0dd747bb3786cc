mm: support anonymous stable page

During developemnt for zram-swap asynchronous writeback, I found strange
corruption of compressed page, resulting in:

With investigation, it reveals currently stable page doesn't support
anonymous page.  IOW, reuse_swap_page can reuse the page without waiting
writeback completion so it can overwrite page zram is compressing.

Unfortunately, zram has used per-cpu stream feature from v4.7.
It aims for increasing cache hit ratio of scratch buffer for
compressing. Downside of that approach is that zram should ask
memory space for compressed page in per-cpu context which requires
stricted gfp flag which could be failed. If so, it retries to
allocate memory space out of per-cpu context so it could get memory
this time and compress the data again, copies it to the memory space.

In this scenario, zram assumes the data should never be changed
but it is not true unless stable page supports. So, If the data is
changed under us, zram can make buffer overrun because second
compression size could be bigger than one we got in previous trial
and blindly, copy bigger size object to smaller buffer which is
buffer overrun. The overrun breaks zsmalloc free object chaining
so system goes crash like above.

I think below is same problem.

Unfortunately, reuse_swap_page should be atomic so that we cannot wait on
writeback in there so the approach in this patch is simply return false if
we found it needs stable page.  Although it increases memory footprint
temporarily, it happens rarely and it should be reclaimed easily althoug
it happened.  Also, It would be better than waiting of IO completion,
which is critial path for application latency.
