ALSA: usb-audio: test EP_FLAG_RUNNING at urb completion

Testing EP_FLAG_RUNNING in snd_complete_urb() before running the completion
logic allows us to save a few cpu cycles by returning early, skipping the
pending urb in case the stream was stopped; the stop logic handles the urb
and sets the completion callbacks to NULL.
