net: stmmac: stmmac_platform: fix parsing of DT binding

commit 64c3b252e9fc ("net: stmmac: fixed the pbl setting with DT")
changed the parsing of the DT binding.

Before 64c3b252e9fc, snps,fixed-burst and snps,mixed-burst were parsed
regardless if the property snps,pbl existed or not.
After the commit, fixed burst and mixed burst are only parsed if
snps,pbl exists. Now when snps,aal has been added, it too is only
parsed if snps,pbl exists.

Since the DT binding does not specify that fixed burst, mixed burst
or aal depend on snps,pbl being specified, undo changes introduced
by 64c3b252e9fc.

The issue commit 64c3b252e9fc ("net: stmmac: fixed the pbl setting with
DT") tries to address is solved in another way:
The databook specifies that all values other than
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 results in undefined behavior,
so snps,pbl = <0> is invalid.

If pbl is 0 after parsing, set pbl to DEFAULT_DMA_PBL.
This handles the case where the property is omitted, and also handles
the case where the property is specified without any data.
