Revert "x86/ioapic: Restore IO-APIC irq_chip retrigger callback"

This reverts commit 020eb3daaba2857b32c4cf4c82f503d6a00a67de.

Gabriel C reports that it causes his machine to not boot, and we haven't
tracked down the reason for it yet.  Since the bug it fixes has been
around for a longish time, we're better off reverting the fix for now.

Gabriel says:
 "It hangs early and freezes with a lot RCU warnings.

  I bisected it down to :

  > Ruslan Ruslichenko (1):
  >       x86/ioapic: Restore IO-APIC irq_chip retrigger callback

  Reverting this one fixes the problem for me..

  The box is a PRIMERGY TX200 S5 , 2 socket , 2 x E5520 CPU(s) installed"

and Ruslan and Thomas are currently stumped.
