x86/kbuild: enable modversions for symbols exported from asm

Commit 4efca4ed ("kbuild: modversions for EXPORT_SYMBOL() for asm") adds
modversion support for symbols exported from asm files. Architectures
must include C-style declarations for those symbols in asm/asm-prototypes.h
in order for them to be versioned.

Add these declarations for x86, and an architecture-independent file that
can be used for common symbols.

With f27c2f6 reverting 8ab2ae6 ("default exported asm symbols to zero") we
produce a scary warning on x86, this commit fixes that.
