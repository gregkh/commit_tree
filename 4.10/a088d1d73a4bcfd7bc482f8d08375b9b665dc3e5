ipv6: Fix IPv6 packet loss in scenarios involving roaming + snooping switches

When for instance a mobile Linux device roams from one access point to
another with both APs sharing the same broadcast domain and a
multicast snooping switch in between:

1)    (c) <~~~> (AP1) <--[SSW]--> (AP2)

2)              (AP1) <--[SSW]--> (AP2) <~~~> (c)

Then currently IPv6 multicast packets will get lost for (c) until an
MLD Querier sends its next query message. The packet loss occurs
because upon roaming the Linux host so far stayed silent regarding
MLD and the snooping switch will therefore be unaware of the
multicast topology change for a while.

This patch fixes this by always resending MLD reports when an interface
change happens, for instance from NO-CARRIER to CARRIER state.
