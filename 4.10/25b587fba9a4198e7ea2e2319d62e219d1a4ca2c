powerpc/pseries: Correct possible read beyond dlpar sysfs buffer

The pasrsing of data written to the dlpar file in sysfs does not correctly
account for the possibility of reading past the end of the buffer. The code
assumes that all pieces of the command witten to the sysfs file are present
in the form "<resource> <action> <id_type> <id>".

Correct this by updating the buffer parsing code to make a local copy and
use the strsep() and sysfs_streq() routines to parse the buffer. This patch
also separates the parsing code into subroutines for each piece of the
command.
