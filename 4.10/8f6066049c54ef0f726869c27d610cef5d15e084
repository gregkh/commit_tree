mm/percpu.c: fix panic triggered by BUG_ON() falsely

As shown by pcpu_build_alloc_info(), the number of units within a percpu
group is deduced by rounding up the number of CPUs within the group to
@upa boundary/ Therefore, the number of CPUs isn't equal to the units's
if it isn't aligned to @upa normally.  However, pcpu_page_first_chunk()
uses BUG_ON() to assert that one number is equal to the other roughly,
so a panic is maybe triggered by the BUG_ON() incorrectly.

In order to fix this issue, the number of CPUs is rounded up then
compared with units's and the BUG_ON() is replaced with a warning and
return of an error code as well, to keep system alive as much as
possible.
