iommu/arm-smmu: Fix group refcounting

When arm_smmu_device_group() finds an existing group due to Stream ID
aliasing, it should be taking an additional reference on that group.
Otherwise, the caller of iommu_group_get_for_dev() will inadvertently
remove the reference taken by iommu_group_add_device(), and the group
will be freed prematurely if any device is removed.
