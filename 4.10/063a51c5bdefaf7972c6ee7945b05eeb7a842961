staging:iio:ad7606: Remove redundant name field from ad7606_chip_info

The name field in the ad7606_chip_info struct is set to the same value as
the as the name field in the corresponding {platform,spi}_device_id table
entry. Remove it from the ad7606_chip_info struct and pass the name from
the ID to the probe function. This slightly reduces the size of the
chip_info table and adding new entries requires less boilerplate.
