PM / Runtime: Don't allow to suspend a device with an active child

When resuming a device in __pm_runtime_set_status(), the prerequisite is
that its parent must already be active, else an error code is returned and
the device's status remains suspended.

When suspending a device there is no similar constraints being validated.
Let's change this to make the behaviour consistent, by not allowing to
suspend a device with an active child, unless it has been explicitly set to
ignore its children.
