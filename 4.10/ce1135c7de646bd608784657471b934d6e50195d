drm/i915: Complete requests in nop_submit_request

Since the submit/execute split in commit d55ac5bf97c6 ("drm/i915: Defer
transfer onto execution timeline to actual hw submission") the
global seqno advance was deferred until the submit_request callback.
After wedging the GPU, we were installing a nop_submit_request handler
(to avoid waking up the dead hw) but I had missed converting this over
to the new scheme. Under the new scheme, we have to explicitly call
i915_gem_submit_request() from the submit_request handler to mark the
request as on the hardware. If we don't the request is always pending,
and any waiter will continue to wait indefinitely and hangcheck will not
be able to resolve the lockup.
