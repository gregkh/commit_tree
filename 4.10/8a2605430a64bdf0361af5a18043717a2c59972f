When superpipe mode is disabled for a LUN, the references for the
local lun are deleted but the LUN is still identified as being present
in the LUN table. This mismatched state can result in the above crash
when the LUN table is restored during an error recovery operation.

To fix this issue, the local LUN information structure is updated to
reflect the LUN is no longer in the LUN table once all references to
the LUN are gone.
