ARCv2: IOC: Adhere to progamming model guidelines to avoid DMA corruption

On AXS103 release bitfiles, DMA data corruptions were seen because IOC
setup was not following the recommended way in documentation.

Flipping IOC on when caches are enabled or coherency transactions are in
flight, might cause some of the memory operations to not observe
coherency as expected.

So strictly follow the programming model recommendations as documented
in comment header above arc_ioc_setup()
