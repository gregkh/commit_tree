drm/i915: Use RPM as the barrier for controlling user mmap access

We can remove the false coupling between RPM and struct mutex by the
observation that we can use the RPM wakeref as the barrier around user
mmap access. That is as we tear down the user's PTE atomically from
within rpm suspend and then to fault in new PTE requires the rpm
wakeref, means that no user access is possible through those PTE without
RPM being awake. Having made that observation, we can then remove the
presumption of having to take rpm outside of struct_mutex and so allow
fine grained acquisition of a wakeref around hw access rather than
having to remember to acquire the wakeref early on.

v2: Rejig placement of the new intel_runtime_pm_get() to be as tight
as possible around the GTT pread/pwrite.
