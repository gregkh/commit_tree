cpu/hotplug: Provide dynamic range for prepare stage

Mathieu reported that the LTTNG modules are broken as of 4.10-rc1 due to
the removal of the cpu hotplug notifiers.

Usually I don't care much about out of tree modules, but LTTNG is widely
used in distros. There are two ways to solve that:

1) Reserve a hotplug state for LTTNG

2) Add a dynamic range for the prepare states.

While #1 is the simplest solution, #2 is the proper one as we can convert
in tree users, which do not care about ordering, to the dynamic range as
well.

Add a dynamic range which allows LTTNG to request states in the prepare
stage.
