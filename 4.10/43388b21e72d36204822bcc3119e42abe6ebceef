fix gfs2_stuffed_write_end() on short copies

a) the page is uptodate - ->write_begin() would either fail (in which
case we don't reach ->write_end()), or unstuff the inode, or find the
page already uptodate, or do a successful call of stuffed_readpage(),
which would've made it uptodate

b) zeroing the tail in pagecache is wrong.  kill -9 at the right time
while writing unmodified file contents to the same file should _not_
leave us in a situation when read() from the file will be reporting
it full of zeroes.  Especially since that effect will be transient -
at some later point the page will be evicted and then we'll be back
to the real file contents.
