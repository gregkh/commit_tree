i2c: mux: pca954x: fix i2c mux selection caching

smbus functions return -ve on error, 0 on success.  However,
__i2c_transfer() have a different return signature - -ve on error, or
number of buffers transferred (which may be zero or greater.)

The upshot of this is that the sense of the test is reversed when using
the mux on a bus supporting the master_xfer method: we cache the value
and never retry if we fail to transfer any buffers, but if we succeed,
we clear the cached value.

Fix this by making pca954x_reg_write() return a negative error code for
all failure cases.
