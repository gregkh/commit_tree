udplite: fix NULL pointer dereference

The commit 850cbaddb52d ("udp: use it's own memory accounting schema")
assumes that the socket proto has memory accounting enabled,
but this is not the case for UDPLITE.
Fix it enabling memory accounting for UDPLITE and performing
fwd allocated memory reclaiming on socket shutdown.
UDP and UDPLITE share now the same memory accounting limits.
Also drop the backlog receive operation, since is no more needed.
