spi: atmel: Use core SPI_MASTER_MUST_[RT]X handling

We need both RX and TX data for each transfer in any case (PIO, PDC, DMA).
So convert the driver to the core dummy buffer handling with the
SPI_MASTER_MUST_RX/SPI_MASTER_MUST_TX infrastructure.

This move changes the maximum PDC/DMA buffer handling to 65535 bytes
instead of a single page and sets master->max_dma_len to this value.

All dummy buffer management is removed from the driver.
