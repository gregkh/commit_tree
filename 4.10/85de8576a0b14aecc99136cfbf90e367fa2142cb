bpf, xdp: allow to pass flags to dev_change_xdp_fd

Add an IFLA_XDP_FLAGS attribute that can be passed for setting up
XDP along with IFLA_XDP_FD, which eventually allows user space to
implement typical add/replace/delete logic for programs. Right now,
calling into dev_change_xdp_fd() will always replace previous programs.

When passed XDP_FLAGS_UPDATE_IF_NOEXIST, we can handle this more
graceful when requested by returning -EBUSY in case we try to
attach a new program, but we find that another one is already
attached. This will be used by upcoming front-end for iproute2 as
well.
