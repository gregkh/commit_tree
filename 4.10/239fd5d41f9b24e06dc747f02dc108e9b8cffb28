staging: lustre: libcfs: shortcut to create CPT from NUMA topology

If user wants to create CPT table that can match numa topology,
she has to query cpu & numa topology, then provide a pattern
string to describe the topology, this is inconvenient.

To improve it, this patch can support shortcut expression "N" or "n"
to create CPT table from NUMA & CPU topology
