Btrfs: remove old tree_root case in btrfs_read_locked_inode()

As Jeff explained in c2951f32d36c ("btrfs: remove old tree_root dirent
processing in btrfs_real_readdir()"), supporting this old format is no
longer necessary since the Btrfs magic number has been updated since we
changed to the current format. There are other places where we still
handle this old format, but since this is part of a fix that is going to
stable, I'm only removing this one for now.
