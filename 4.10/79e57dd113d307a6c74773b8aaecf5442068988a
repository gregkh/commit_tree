ath9k: Really fix LED polarity for some Mini PCI AR9220 MB92 cards.

The active_high LED of my Wistron DNMA-92 is still being recognized as
active_low on 4.7.6 mainline. When I was preparing my former commit
0f9edcdd88a9 ("ath9k: Fix LED polarity for some Mini PCI AR9220 MB92
cards.") to fix that I must have somehow messed up with testing, because
I tested the final version of that patch before sending it, and it was
apparently working; but now it is not working on 4.7.6 mainline.

I initially added the PCI_DEVICE_SUB section for 0x0029/0x2096 above the
PCI_VDEVICE section for 0x0029; but then I moved the former below the
latter after seeing how 0x002A sections were sorted in the file.

This turned out to be wrong: if a generic PCI_VDEVICE entry (that has
both subvendor and subdevice IDs set to PCI_ANY_ID) is put before a more
specific one (PCI_DEVICE_SUB), then the generic PCI_VDEVICE entry will
match first and will be used.

With this patch, 0x0029/0x2096 has finally got active_high LED on 4.7.6.

While I'm at it, let's fix 0x002A too by also moving its generic definition
below its specific ones.
