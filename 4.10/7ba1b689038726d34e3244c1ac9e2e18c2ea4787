NET: mkiss: Fix panic

If a USB-to-serial adapter is unplugged, the driver re-initializes, with
dev->hard_header_len and dev->addr_len set to zero, instead of the correct
values.  If then a packet is sent through the half-dead interface, the
kernel will panic due to running out of headroom in the skb when pushing
for the AX.25 headers resulting in this panic:

[<c0595468>] (skb_panic) from [<c0401f70>] (skb_push+0x4c/0x50)
[<c0401f70>] (skb_push) from [<bf0bdad4>] (ax25_hard_header+0x34/0xf4 [ax25])
[<bf0bdad4>] (ax25_hard_header [ax25]) from [<bf0d05d4>] (ax_header+0x38/0x40 [mkiss])
[<bf0d05d4>] (ax_header [mkiss]) from [<c041b584>] (neigh_compat_output+0x8c/0xd8)
[<c041b584>] (neigh_compat_output) from [<c043e7a8>] (ip_finish_output+0x2a0/0x914)
[<c043e7a8>] (ip_finish_output) from [<c043f948>] (ip_output+0xd8/0xf0)
[<c043f948>] (ip_output) from [<c043f04c>] (ip_local_out_sk+0x44/0x48)

This patch makes mkiss behave like the 6pack driver. 6pack does not
panic.  In 6pack.c sp_setup() (same function name here) the values for
dev->hard_header_len and dev->addr_len are set to the same values as in
my mkiss patch.
