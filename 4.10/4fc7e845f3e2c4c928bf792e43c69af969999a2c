drm/i915/skl: tell the user about pre-production hardware

We just removed the implementation for all the pre-production
workarounds, so now tell the user that we expect his machine to not
work properly. Also convert this to DRM_ERROR so we can more easily
spot these problems in bug reports and CI/QA runs.
