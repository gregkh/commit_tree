drm/i915: Fix use after free in logical_render_ring_init

Commit 3b3f1650b1ca ("drm/i915: Allocate intel_engine_cs
structure only for the enabled engines") introduced the
dynanically allocated engine instances and created an
potential use after free scenario in logical_render_ring_init
where lrc_destroy_wa_ctx_obj could be called after the engine
instance has been freed.

This can only happen during engine setup/init error handling
which luckily does not happen ever in practice.

Fix is to not call lrc_destroy_wa_ctx_obj since it would have
already been executed from the preceding engine cleanup.
