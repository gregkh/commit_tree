drm: Helper for lspcon in drm_dp_dual_mode

This patch adds lspcon support in dp_dual_mode helper.
lspcon is essentially a dp->hdmi dongle with dual personality.

LS mode: It works as a passive dongle, by level shifting DP++
signals to HDMI signals, in LS mode.
PCON mode: It works as a protocol converter active dongle
in pcon mode, by converting DP++ outputs to HDMI 2.0 outputs.

This patch adds support for lspcon detection and mode set
switch operations, as a dp dual mode dongle.

v2: Addressed review comments from Ville
- add adaptor id for lspcon devices (0x08), use it to identify lspcon
