net: set SK_MEM_QUANTUM to 4096

Systems with large pages (64KB pages for example) do not always have
huge quantity of memory.

A big SK_MEM_QUANTUM value leads to fewer interactions with the
global counters (like tcp_memory_allocated) but might trigger
memory pressure much faster, giving suboptimal TCP performance
since windows are lowered to ridiculous values.

Note that sysctl_mem units being in pages and in ABI, we also need
to change sk_prot_mem_limits() accordingly.
