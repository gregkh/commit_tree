drm/bridge: analogix_dp: return error if transfer none byte

Reference from drm_dp_aux description (about transfer):
Upon success, the implementation should return the number of payload bytes
that were transferred, or a negative error-code on failure. Helpers
propagate errors from the .transfer() function, with the exception of
the -EBUSY error, which causes a transaction to be retried. On a short,
helpers will return -EPROTO to make it simpler to check for failure.

The analogix_dp_transfer will return num_transferred, but if there is none
byte been transferred, the return value will be 0, which means success, we
should return error-code if transfer none byte.

for (retry = 0; retry < 32; retry++) {
	err = aux->transfer(aux, &msg);
	if (err < 0) {
		if (err == -EBUSY)
			continue;

		goto unlock;
	}
}
