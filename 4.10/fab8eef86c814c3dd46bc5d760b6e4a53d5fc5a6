xfs: sanity check inode mode when creating new dentry

The helper xfs_dentry_to_name() is used by 2 different
classes of callers: Callers that pass zero mode and don't care
about the returned name.type field and Callers that pass
non zero mode and do care about the name.type field.

Change xfs_dentry_to_name() to not take the mode argument and
change the call sites of the first class to not pass the mode
argument.

Create a new helper xfs_dentry_mode_to_name() which does pass
the mode argument and returns -EFSCORRUPTED if mode is invalid.
Callers that translate non zero mode to on-disk file type now
check the return value and will export the error to user instead
of staging an invalid file type to be written to directory entry.
