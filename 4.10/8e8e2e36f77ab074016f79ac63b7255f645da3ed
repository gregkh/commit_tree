staging: vc04_services: Handle conversion from VCHIQ_SERVICE_HANDLE_T to VCHI_SERVICE_HANDLE_T

A VCHIQ_SERVICE_HANDLE_T which is an int is stuffed into a
VCHI_SERVICE_HANDLE_T which is a pointer, passed around, then
converted back to a VCHIQ_SERVICE_HANDLE_T. Since the data is
always actually a VCHIQ_SERVICE_HANDLE_T(int), never actually a
pointer, it is safe to simply cast the two back in forth.

Note that pointers are never stuffed into an int.
