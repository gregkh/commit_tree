usb: gadget: mv_u3d: mv_u3d_start_queue() refactoring

The patch improves readability of mv_u3d_start_queue()
by rearranging its code with two semantic modifications:
- assignment zero to ep->processing if usb_gadget_map_request() fails;
- propagation of error code from mv_u3d_req_to_trb() instead of
  hardcoded -ENOMEM.
