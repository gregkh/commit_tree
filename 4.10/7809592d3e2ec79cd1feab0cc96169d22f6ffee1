bnxt_en: Enable MSIX early in bnxt_init_one().

To better support the new RDMA driver, we need to move pci_enable_msix()
from bnxt_open() to bnxt_init_one().  This way, MSIX vectors are available
to the RDMA driver whether the network device is up or down.

Part of the existing bnxt_setup_int_mode() function is now refactored into
a new bnxt_init_int_mode().  bnxt_init_int_mode() is called during
bnxt_init_one() to enable MSIX.  The remaining logic in
bnxt_setup_int_mode() to map the IRQs to the completion rings is called
during bnxt_open().

v2: Fixed compile warning when CONFIG_BNXT_SRIOV is not set.
