ceph: fix splice read for no Fc capability case

When iov_iter type is ITER_PIPE, copy_page_to_iter() increases
the page's reference and add the page to a pipe_buffer. It also
set the pipe_buffer's ops to page_cache_pipe_buf_ops. The comfirm
callback in page_cache_pipe_buf_ops expects the page is from page
cache and uptodate, otherwise it return error.

For ceph_sync_read() case, pages are not from page cache. So we
can't call copy_page_to_iter() when iov_iter type is ITER_PIPE.
The fix is using iov_iter_get_pages_alloc() to allocate pages
for the pipe. (the code is similar to default_file_splice_read)
