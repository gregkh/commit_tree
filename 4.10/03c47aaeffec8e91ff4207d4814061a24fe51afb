[media] uvcvideo: add support for Oculus Rift Sensor

The Rift CV1 Sensor has bInterfaceClass set to vendor specific, so we
need an entry in uvc_ids to probe it. Just as the Rift DK2 IR tracker,
it misreports the pixel format as YUYV instead of Y8.

The sensor is configured with a low exposure time and high black level
by default, so that only bright IR sources can be seen.
