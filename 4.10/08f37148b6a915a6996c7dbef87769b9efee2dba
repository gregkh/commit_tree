usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix iterations on endpoints.

When zero endpoints are declared for a function, there is no endpoint
to disable, enable or free, so replace do...while loops with while loops.
Change pre-decrement to post-decrement to iterate the same number of times
when there are endpoints to process.
