i2c: designware: Allow reduce bus speed by "clock-frequency" property

Allow more flexibility to bus speed selection. Now if there are I2C
slave connections defined in ACPI the speed of slowest device on the bus
will define the bus speed. However if also "clock-frequency" device
property is defined we should use the slowest of these two.

This is targeted to maker boards where developer may want to connect
slower I2C slave devices to the bus than defined in existing ACPI I2C
slave connections.
