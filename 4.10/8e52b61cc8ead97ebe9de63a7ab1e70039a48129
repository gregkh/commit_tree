mfd: syscon: Support native-endian regmaps

The regmap devicetree binding documentation states that a native-endian
property should be supported as well as big-endian & little-endian,
however syscon in its duplication of the parsing of these properties
omits support for native-endian. Fix this by setting
REGMAP_ENDIAN_NATIVE when a native-endian property is found.
