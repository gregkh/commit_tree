HID: sony: Adjust value range for motion sensors

The motion sensor values are 16-bit, so make the value range match.
It is hard to reach the upper values, but they can be reached. At
least the current accelerometer value of 8192 is very easy to pass.

It is still not nice that the motion sensors live in no man's land
in between ABS_MISC and ABS_MT_SLOT, but that's something for another
time, which the proposed ABS_ACCEL_*/ABS_GYRO_* were meant for.
