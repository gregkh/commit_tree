remoteproc: Add a sysfs interface for firmware and state

This patch adds a sysfs interface to rproc allowing the firmware name
and processor state to be changed dynamically.

State was previously available in debugfs, and is replicated here. The
firmware file allows retrieval of the running firmware name, and a new
one to be specified at run time, so long as the remote processor has
been stopped.
