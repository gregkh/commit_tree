dma-buf/fence: revert "don't wait when specified timeout is zero" (v2)

Reverts commit 847b19a39e4c
	("dma-buf/fence: don't wait when specified timeout is zero")

When we don't call the wait function software signaling might never be
activated. This can cause infinite polling loops with unreliable interrupt
driven hardware.

v2: rebase on drm-next
