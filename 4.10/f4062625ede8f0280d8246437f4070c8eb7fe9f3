[media] cec: add flag to cec_log_addrs to enable RC passthrough

By default the CEC_MSG_USER_CONTROL_PRESSED/RELEASED messages
are passed on to the follower(s) only. If the new
CEC_LOG_ADDRS_FL_ALLOW_RC_PASSTHRU flag is set in the
flags field of struct cec_log_addrs then these messages are also
passed on to the remote control input subsystem and they will appear
as keystrokes.

This used to be the default behavior, but now you have to explicitly
enable it. This is done to force the caller to think about possible
security issues (e.g. if these messages are used to enter passwords).
