rtc: sparc: make starfire explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/rtc/Kconfig:config RTC_DRV_STARFIRE
drivers/rtc/Kconfig:    bool "Starfire RTC"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
