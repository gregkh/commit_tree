f2fs: Cache zoned block devices zone type

With the zoned block device feature enabled, section discard
need to do a zone reset for sections contained in sequential
zones, and a regular discard (if supported) for sections
stored in conventional zones. Avoid the need for a costly
report zones to obtain a section zone type when discarding it
by caching the types of the device zones in the super block
information. This cache is initialized at mount time for mounts
with the zoned block device feature enabled.
