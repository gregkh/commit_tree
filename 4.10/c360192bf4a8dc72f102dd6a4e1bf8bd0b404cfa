s390/preempt: move preempt_count to the lowcore

Convert s390 to use a field in the struct lowcore for the CPU
preemption count. It is a bit cheaper to access a lowcore field
compared to a thread_info variable and it removes the depencency
on a task related structure.

bloat-o-meter on the vmlinux image for the default configuration
(CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y) reports a small reduction in text size:

add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 18/578 up/down: 228/-5448 (-5220)

A larger improvement is achieved with the default configuration
but with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y and CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=n:

add/remove: 2/6 grow/shrink: 59/4477 up/down: 1618/-228762 (-227144)
