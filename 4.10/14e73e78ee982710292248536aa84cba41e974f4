tile: use __ro_after_init instead of tile-specific __write_once

The semantics of the old tile __write_once are the same as the
newer generic __ro_after_init, so rename them all and get rid
of the tile-specific version.

This does not enable actual support for __ro_after_init,
which had been dropped from the tile architecture before the
initial upstreaming was done, since we had at that time switched
to using 16MB huge pages to map the kernel.
