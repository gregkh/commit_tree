drm/i915/skl+: Prepare for removing data rate from skl watermark state, v2.

Caching is not required, drm_atomic_crtc_state_for_each_plane_state can
be used to inspect the states of all planes assigned to the CRTC even
if they are not part of _state, so we can just recalculate every time.

Changes since v1:
- Remove plane->pipe checks, they're implied by the macros.
- Split unrelated changes to a separate commit.
