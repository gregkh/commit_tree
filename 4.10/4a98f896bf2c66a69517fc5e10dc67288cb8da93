scsi: ncr5380: Use correct types for DMA routines

Apply prototypes to get consistent function signatures for the DMA
functions implemented in the board-specific drivers. To avoid using
macros to alter actual parameters, some of those functions are reworked
slightly.

This is a step toward the goal of passing the board-specific routines
to the core driver using an ops struct (as in a platform driver or
library module).

This also helps fix some inconsistent types: where the core driver uses
ints (cmd->SCp.this_residual and hostdata->dma_len) for keeping track of
transfers, certain board-specific routines used unsigned long.

While we are fixing these function signatures, pass the hostdata pointer
to DMA routines instead of a Scsi_Host pointer, for shorter and faster
code.
