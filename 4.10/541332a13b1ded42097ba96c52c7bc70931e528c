extcon: usb-gpio: Add VBUS detection support

Driver can now work with both ID and VBUS pins or either one of
them.

There can be the following 3 cases

1) Both ID and VBUS GPIOs are available:

ID = LOW -> USB_HOST active, USB inactive
ID = HIGH -> USB_HOST inactive, USB state is same as VBUS.

2) Only ID GPIO is available:

ID = LOW -> USB_HOST active, USB inactive
ID = HIGH -> USB_HOST inactive, USB active

3) Only VBUS GPIO is available:

VBUS = LOW -> USB_HOST inactive, USB inactive
VBUS = HIGH -> USB_HOST inactive, USB active
