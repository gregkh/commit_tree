ASoC: compress: Add support for compress dai ops

ASoC Compress ops have only platform ops and no DAI ops unlike PCM device
where we have both platform ops as well as DAI ops.

So add compress dai ops and add this new structure to the ASoC core to make
compressed devices a first class ASoC citizen

Again like PCM ops, drivers are free to implement either or both of
these ops based on device needs.
