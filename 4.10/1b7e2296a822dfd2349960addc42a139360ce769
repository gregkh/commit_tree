arm64: assembler: introduce ldr_this_cpu

Shortly we will want to load a percpu variable in the return from
userspace path. We can save an instruction by folding the addition of
the percpu offset into the load instruction, and this patch adds a new
helper to do so.

At the same time, we clean up this_cpu_ptr for consistency. As with
{adr,ldr,str}_l, we change the template to take the destination register
first, and name this dst. Secondly, we rename the macro to adr_this_cpu,
following the scheme of adr_l, and matching the newly added
ldr_this_cpu.
