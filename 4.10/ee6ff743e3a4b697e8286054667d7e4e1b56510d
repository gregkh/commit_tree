mmc: core: Restore parts of the polling policy when switch to HS/HS DDR

Regressions for not being able to detect an eMMC HS DDR mode card has been
reported for the sdhci-esdhc-imx driver, but potentially other sdhci
variants may suffer from the similar problem.

The commit e173f8911f09 ("mmc: core: Update CMD13 polling policy when
switch to HS DDR mode"), is causing the problem. It seems that change moved
one step to far, regarding changing the host's timing before polling for a
busy card.

To fix this, let's move back to the behaviour when the host's timing is
updated after the polling, but before the switch status is fetched and
validated.

In cases when polling with CMD13, we keep validating the switch status at
each attempt. However, to align with the other card busy detections
mechanism, let's fetch and validate the switch status also after the host's
timing is updated.
