radix-tree: add radix_tree_split_preload()

Calculate how many nodes we need to allocate to split an old_order entry
into multiple entries, each of size new_order.  The test suite checks
that we allocated exactly the right number of nodes; neither too many
(checked by rtp->nr == 0), nor too few (checked by comparing
nr_allocated before and after the call to radix_tree_split()).
