nfs: Don't increment lock sequence ID after NFS4ERR_MOVED

Xuan Qi reports that the Linux NFSv4 client failed to lock a file
that was migrated. The steps he observed on the wire:

1. The client sent a LOCK request to the source server
2. The source server replied NFS4ERR_MOVED
3. The client switched to the destination server
4. The client sent the same LOCK request to the destination
   server with a bumped lock sequence ID
5. The destination server rejected the LOCK request with
   NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID

RFC 3530 section 8.1.5 provides a list of NFS errors which do not
bump a lock sequence ID.

However, RFC 3530 is now obsoleted by RFC 7530. In RFC 7530 section
9.1.7, this list has been updated by the addition of NFS4ERR_MOVED.
