[media] smiapp: Make suspend and resume functions __maybe_unused

The smiapp_suspend() and smiapp_resume() functions will end up being unused
if CONFIG_PM is enabled but CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is disabled, causing a
compiler warning from both of the function definitions. Fix this by
marking the functions with __maybe_unused.
