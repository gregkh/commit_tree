iommu: Allow taking a reference on a group directly

iommu_group_get_for_dev() expects that the IOMMU driver's device_group
callback return a group with a reference held for the given device.
Whilst allocating a new group is fine, and pci_device_group() correctly
handles reusing an existing group, there is no general means for IOMMU
drivers doing their own group lookup to take additional references on an
existing group pointer without having to also store device pointers or
resort to elaborate trickery.

Add an IOMMU-driver-specific function to fill the hole.
