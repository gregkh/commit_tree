workqueue: make workqueue available early during boot

Workqueue is currently initialized in an early init call; however,
there are cases where early boot code has to be split and reordered to
come after workqueue initialization or the same code path which makes
use of workqueues is used both before workqueue initailization and
after.  The latter cases have to gate workqueue usages with
keventd_up() tests, which is nasty and easy to get wrong.

Workqueue usages have become widespread and it'd be a lot more
convenient if it can be used very early from boot.  This patch splits
workqueue initialization into two steps.  workqueue_init_early() which
sets up the basic data structures so that workqueues can be created
and work items queued, and workqueue_init() which actually brings up
workqueues online and starts executing queued work items.  The former
step can be done very early during boot once memory allocation,
cpumasks and idr are initialized.  The latter right after kthreads
become available.

This allows work item queueing and canceling from very early boot
which is what most of these use cases want.

* As systemd_wq being initialized doesn't indicate that workqueue is
  fully online anymore, update keventd_up() to test wq_online instead.
  The follow-up patches will get rid of all its usages and the
  function itself.

* Flushing doesn't make sense before workqueue is fully initialized.
  The flush functions trigger WARN and return immediately before fully
  online.

* Work items are never in-flight before fully online.  Canceling can
  always succeed by skipping the flush step.

* Some code paths can no longer assume to be called with irq enabled
  as irq is disabled during early boot.  Use irqsave/restore
  operations instead.

v2: Watchdog init, which requires timer to be running, moved from
    workqueue_init_early() to workqueue_init().
