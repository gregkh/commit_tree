serial: imx: protect Soft Reset of port with lock

Previously Soft Reset (clear of SRST bit in UCR2 register)
of UART in startup is not protected by lock, which may have race
with console_write, as console_write may occur at anytime even
when UART port is shutdown.

To avoid this race, protect Soft reset of UART port with spin_lock.
