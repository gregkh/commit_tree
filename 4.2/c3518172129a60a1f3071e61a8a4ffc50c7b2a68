gpio: omap: rework omap_gpio_request to touch only gpio specific registers

The GPIO Chip and GPIO IRQ Chip functionality are essentially orthogonal,
so GPIO Chip implementation shouldn't touch GPIO IRQ specific registers
and vise versa.

Hence, rework omap_gpio_request:
- don't reset GPIO IRQ triggering type to IRQ_TYPE_NONE, because
  GPIO irqchip should be responsible for that;
- call directly omap_enable_gpio_module as all needed checks are already
  present inside it.
