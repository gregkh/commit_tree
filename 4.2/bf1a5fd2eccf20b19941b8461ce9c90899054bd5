    drm/i915: Allow parsing of variable size child device entries from VBT

That commit is not valid for v4.2, however it will be valid for v4.3. It
was simply queued too early.

The referenced regressing commit is just fine until the size of struct
common_child_dev_config changes, and that won't happen until
v4.3. Indeed, the expected size checks here rely on the increased size
of the struct, breaking new platforms.
