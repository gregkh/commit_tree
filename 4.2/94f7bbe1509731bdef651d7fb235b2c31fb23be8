drm/i915: Snapshot seqno of most recently submitted request.

The hang checker needs to inspect whether or not the ring request list is empty
as well as if the given engine has reached or passed the most recently
submitted request. The problem with this is that the hang checker cannot grab
the struct_mutex, which is required in order to safely inspect requests since
requests might be deallocated during inspection. In the past we've had kernel
panics due to this very unsynchronized access in the hang checker.

One solution to this problem is to not inspect the requests directly since
we're only interested in the seqno of the most recently submitted request - not
the request itself. Instead the seqno of the most recently submitted request is
stored separately, which the hang checker then inspects, circumventing the
issue of synchronization from the hang checker entirely.

This fixes a regression introduced in

    drm/i915: Convert 'ring_idle()' to use requests not seqnos

v2 (Chris Wilson):
- Pass current engine seqno to ring_idle() from i915_hangcheck_elapsed() rather
than compute it over again.
- Remove extra whitespace.
