ia64: remove paravirt code

All the ia64 pvops code is now dead code since both
xen and kvm support have been ripped out [0] [1]. Just
that no one had troubled to rip this stuff out. The only
useful remaining pieces were the old pvops docs but that
was recently also generalized and moved out from ia64 [2].

This has been run time tested on an ia64 Madison system.
