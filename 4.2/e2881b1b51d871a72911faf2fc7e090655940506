ext4 crypto: separate kernel and userspace structure for the key

Use struct ext4_encryption_key only for the master key passed via the
kernel keyring.

For internal kernel space users, we now use struct ext4_crypt_info.
This will allow us to put information from the policy structure so we
can cache it and avoid needing to constantly looking up the extended
attribute.  We will do this in a spearate patch.  This patch is mostly
mechnical to make it easier for patch review.
