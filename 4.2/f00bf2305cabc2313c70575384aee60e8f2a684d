sfc: don't update stats on VF when called in atomic context

The ifenslave command to set up a bond runs in an atomic
context, and it queries the stats on the devices that are
being enslaved. A VF needs to make an MCDI call to update
its stats, which is not allowed in atomic context.

The releasing of the stats_lock is moved to the beginning of
the VF stats update function so that in_interrupt() can be
used; it must be taken again before returning from this
function.
