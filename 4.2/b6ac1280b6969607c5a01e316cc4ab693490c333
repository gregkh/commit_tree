gpio: Prevent an integer overflow in the pca953x driver

Interrupts were missed if an 8-bit integer overflow occurred. This was
observed when bank0,pin7 and bank1,pin7 changed simultaniously.

As the 8-bit totals were only checked against zero, replace them with
booleans. Name the booleans so that their purpose is clear.
