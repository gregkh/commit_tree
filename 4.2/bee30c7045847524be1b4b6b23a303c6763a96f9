cxl: Re-order card init to check the VSEC earlier

When we expose AFUs as virtual PCI devices, they may look like the physical
CAPI PCI card.  ie they may have the same vendor/device IDs.

We want to avoid these AFUs binding to this driver and any init this driver may
do.

Re-order card init to check the VSEC earlier before assigning BARs or
activating CXL.  Also change the dev used in early prints as the adapter struct
may not be inited at this earlier stage.
