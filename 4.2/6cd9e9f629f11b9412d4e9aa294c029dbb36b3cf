thermal: of: fix cooling device weights in device tree

Currently you can specify the weight of the cooling device in the device
tree but that information is not populated to the
thermal_bind_params where the fair share governor expects it to
be.  The of thermal zone device doesn't have a thermal_bind_params
structure and arguably it's better to pass the weight inside the
thermal_instance as it is specific to the bind of a cooling device to a
thermal zone parameter.

Core thermal code is fixed to populate the weight in the instance from
the thermal_bind_params, so platform code that was passing the weight
inside the thermal_bind_params continue to work seamlessly.

While we are at it, create a default value for the weight parameter for
those thermal zones that currently don't define it and remove the
hardcoded default in of-thermal.
