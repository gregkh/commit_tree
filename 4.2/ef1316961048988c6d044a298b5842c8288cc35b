drm/qxl: Propagate correctly errors from qxlhw_handle_to_bo

This function could return a NULL pointer in case of handle not
present and in case of out of memory conditions however caller
function always returned EINVAL error hiding a possible ENOMEM.
This patch change the function to return the error instead to
be able to propagate the error instead of assuming EINVAL.
