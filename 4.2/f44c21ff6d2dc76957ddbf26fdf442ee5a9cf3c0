mfd: cros_ec: spi: Add a DT property to delay asserting the CS

Some ECs need a little time for waking up before they can accept
SPI data at a high speed. Add a "google,cros-ec-spi-pre-delay"
property to the DT binding to configure this.

If this property isn't set, then no delay will be added. However,
if set it will cause a delay equal to the value passed to it to
be inserted at the beginning of a transaction.
