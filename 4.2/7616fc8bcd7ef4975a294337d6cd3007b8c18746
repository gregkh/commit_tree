arm64: alternative: Allow immediate branch as alternative instruction

Since all branches are PC-relative on AArch64, these instructions
cannot be used as an alternative with the simplistic approach
we currently have (the immediate has been computed from
the .altinstr_replacement section, and end-up being completely off
if the target is outside of the replacement sequence).

This patch handles the branch instructions in a different way,
using the insn framework to recompute the immediate, and generate
the right displacement in the above case.
