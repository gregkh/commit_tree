MIPS: Replace smp_mb with release barrier function in unlocks.

Repleace smp_mb() in arch_write_unlock() and __clear_bit_unlock() to
smp_mb__before_llsc() call which does "release" barrier functionality.

It seems like it was missed in commit f252ffd50c97dae87b45f1dbad24f71358ccfbd6
during introduction of "acquire" and "release" semantics.

[ralf@linux-mips: The original patch submission was labelled a fix but
actually it replaces a barrier with another less restrictive type of
barrier so it doesn't fix any ill behaviour but rather squeezes out a
tad better performance.  Further improvments will be possible once
smp_release() has been merged.]
