    [PATCH] VT binding: Add sysfs control to the VT layer

with the justification

    "In addition, if any of the consoles are in KD_GRAPHICS mode, binding and
    unbinding will not succeed.  KD_GRAPHICS mode usually indicates that the
    underlying console hardware is used for other purposes other than displaying
    text (ie X).  This feature should prevent binding/unbinding from interfering
    with a graphics application using the VT."

I think we should lift this artificial restriction though:
- KD_GRAPHICS doesn't get cleaned up automatically, which means it's
  easy to have terminals stuck in KD_GRAPHICS when hacking around on
  X.
- X doesn't really care, especially with drm where kms already blocks
  fbdev (and hence fbcon) when there's an active compositor.
- This is a root-only interface with a separate .config option and
  it's possible to hang your machine already anyway if you
  unload/reload drivers and don't know what you're doing.

With this patch i915.ko module reloading works again reliably,
something in the recent fedora upgrades broke things.
