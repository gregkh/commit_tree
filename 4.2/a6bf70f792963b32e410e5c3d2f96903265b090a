tipc: simplify include dependencies

When we try to add new inline functions in the code, we sometimes
run into circular include dependencies.

The main problem is that the file core.h, which really should be at
the root of the dependency chain, instead is a leaf. I.e., core.h
includes a number of header files that themselves should be allowed
to include core.h. In reality this is unnecessary, because core.h does
not need to know the full signature of any of the structs it refers to,
only their type declaration.

In this commit, we remove all dependencies from core.h towards any
other tipc header file.

As a consequence of this change, we can now move the function
tipc_own_addr(net) from addr.c to addr.h, and make it inline.

There are no functional changes in this commit.
