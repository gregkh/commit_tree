ARM: bcm2835: Skip doing our own iotable_init() initialization

The only thing we were using this 16MB mapping of IO peripherals for
was the uart's early debug mapping.  If we just drop the map_io hook,
the kernel will call debug_ll_io_init() for us, which maps the single
page needed for the device.
