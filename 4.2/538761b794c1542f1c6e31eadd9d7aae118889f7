mvneta: add forgotten initialization of autonegotiation bits

The commit 898b2970e2c9 ("mvneta: implement SGMII-based in-band link state
signaling")
changed mvneta_adjust_link() so that it does not clear the auto-negotiation
bits in MVNETA_GMAC_AUTONEG_CONFIG register. This was necessary for
auto-negotiation mode to work.
Unfortunately I haven't checked if these bits are ever initialized.
It appears they are not.
This patch adds the missing initialization of the auto-negotiation bits
in the MVNETA_GMAC_AUTONEG_CONFIG register.
It fixes the following regression:

Since the patch was tested to fix a regression, it should be applied to
stable tree.
