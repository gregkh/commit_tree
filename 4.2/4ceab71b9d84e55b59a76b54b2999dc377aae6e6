cfq-iosched: move group scheduling functions under ifdef

If CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED is not set, the compiler produces the
following warning:

  CC      block/cfq-iosched.o
  linux/block/cfq-iosched.c:469:2:
    warning: 'cpd_to_cfqgd' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
    *cpd_to_cfqgd(struct blkcg_policy_data *cpd)
     ^

In reality, two other lookup functions aren't used either if
CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED isn't set. Move all three under one of the
CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED sections in the code.
