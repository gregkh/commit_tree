bnx2x: Prevent false warning when accessing MACs

Each time a flow finishes reads from the classification shadow
configuration in the driver, that flow would check for pending commands
and pass them to FW if possible.
In case there's already a completion pending command, I.e., a ramrod
that has been sent to the FW and is yet to be completed while said flow
tries to configure the pending command we would get a false error message
in logs [and panic if SOE was used for driver compilation] since the
command could not have been completed.

This prevents said print [and panic]; The pending command will be sent by
the time the completion of the current sent command would arrive.
