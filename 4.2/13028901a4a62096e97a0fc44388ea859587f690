btrfs: let tree defrag work in SSD mode

Long time ago (2008) the defrag was automatic for new b-tree writes but
has been disabled after performance problems. There was a leftover in
tree-defrag.c that effectively stops any defragmentation on b-trees.
This is a bit unexpected and IMHO undesired. The SSD mode is an
optimization and defrag is supposed to work if the users asks for it.

misses the bits from tree-defrag.c to revert to the behaviour introduced
