f2fs: do not trim preallocated blocks when truncating after i_size

When we perform generic/092 in xfstests, output is like below:

     XXX Bytes, X ops; XX:XX:XX.X (XXX YYY/sec and XXX ops/sec)
     0: [0..10239]: data
     0: [0..10239]: data
    -1: [10240..20479]: unwritten
    +1: [10240..14335]: unwritten

This is because with this testcase, we redefine the regulation for
truncate in perallocated space past i_size as below:

"There was some confused about what the fs was supposed to do when you
truncate at i_size with preallocated space past i_size. We decided on the
following things.

1) truncate(i_size) will trim all blocks past i_size.
2) truncate(x) where x > i_size will not trim all blocks past i_size.
"

This method is used in xfs, and then ext4/btrfs will follow the rule.

This patch fixes to follow the new rule for f2fs.
