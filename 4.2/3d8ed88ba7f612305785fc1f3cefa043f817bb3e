zram: add `compact` sysfs entry to documentation

We currently don't support zram on-demand device creation.  The only way
to have N zram devices is to specify num_devices module parameter (default
value 1).  That means that if, for some reason, at some point, user wants
to have N + 1 devies he/she must umount all the existing devices, unload
the module, load the module passing num_devices equals to N + 1.

This patchset introduces zram-control sysfs class, which has two sysfs
attrs:

 - hot_add     -- add a new zram device
 - hot_remove  -- remove a specific (device_id) zram device

    Usage example:
        # add a new specific zram device
        cat /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add
        1

        # remove a specific zram device
        echo 4 > /sys/class/zram-control/hot_remove
