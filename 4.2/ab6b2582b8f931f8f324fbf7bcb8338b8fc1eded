OMAPDSS: DISPC: add check for scaling limits

On OMAP3/AM43xx some scaling factors cause underflows/synclosts. After
studying this, I found that sometimes the driver uses three-tap scaling
with downscaling factor smaller than x0.5. This causes issues, as x0.5
is the limit for three-tap scaling.

The driver has FEAT_PARAM_DOWNSCALE parameter, but that seems to be for
five-tap scaling, which allows scaling down to x0.25.

This patch adds checks for both horizontal and vertical scaling. For
horizontal the HW always uses 5 taps, so the limit is x0.25.
