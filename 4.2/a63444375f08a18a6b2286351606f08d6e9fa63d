misc: mic: scif bug fix for vmalloc_to_page crash

v4.2-rc1 enabled huge page support for ioremap(..).
Calling vmalloc_to_page after v4.2-rc1 results in the
crash shown below on the host upon booting X100 coprocessors:

BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffc47c00000000
IP: [<ffffffff811a2c0c>] vmalloc_to_page+0x6c/0xb0

This patch fixes this crash by obtaining the fake struct page
pointer which is required to be passed into dma_map_sg(..)
by calling pfn_to_page(..) instead of vmalloc_to_page(..).
