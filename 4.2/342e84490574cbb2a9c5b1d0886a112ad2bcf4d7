ALSA: hda - Fix race between PM ops and HDA init/probe

PM ops could be triggered before HDA is done initializing
and cause PM to set HDA controller to D3Hot.  This can result
in "CORB reset timeout#2, CORBRP = 65535" and "no codecs
initialized".  Additionally, PM ops can be triggered before
azx_probe_continue finishes (async probe).  This can result
in a NULL deref kernel crash.

To fix this, avoid PM ops if !chip->running.
