clk: Update docs after removal of clk-private.h

Currently Documentation/clk.txt describes an obsolete techinique to
statically define struct clk objects.

This capability was removed by b09d6d991025("clk: remove clk-private.h")
and is no longer supported. The documentation describing the feature should
be removed.
