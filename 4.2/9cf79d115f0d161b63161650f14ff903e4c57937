bitmap: remove explicit newline handling using scnprintf format string

bitmap_print_to_pagebuf uses scnprintf to copy the cpumask/list to page
buffer.  It handles the newline and trailing null character explicitly.

It's unnecessary and also partially duplicated as scnprintf already adds
trailing null character.  The newline can be passed through format
string to scnprintf.  This patch does that simplification.

However theoretically there's one behavior difference: when the buffer
is too small, the original code would still output '\n' at the end while
the new code(with this patch) would just continue to print the formatted
string.  Since this function is dealing with only page buffers, it's
highly unlikely to hit that corner case.

This patch will help in auditing the users of bitmap_print_to_pagebuf to
verify that the buffer passed is large enough and get rid of it
completely by replacing them with direct scnprintf()
