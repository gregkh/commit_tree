drm/i915: Clear pipe's pll hw state in hsw_dp_set_ddi_pll_sel()

Similarly to what is done for SKL, clear the dpll_hw_state of the pipe
config in hsw_dp_set_ddi_pll_sel(), since it main contain stale values.
That can happen if a crtc that was previously driving an HDMI connector
switches to a DP connector. In that case, the wrpll field was left with
its old value, leading to warnings like the one below:

[drm:check_crtc_state [i915]] *ERROR* mismatch in dpll_hw_state.wrpll (expected 0xb035061f, found 0x00000000)

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 767 at drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_display.c:12324 check_crtc_state+0x975/0x10b0 [i915]()
pipe state doesn't match!
