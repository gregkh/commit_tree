netconsole: make all dynamic netconsoles share a mutex

Currently, each dynamic netconsole_target uses its own separate mutex to
synchronize the configuration operations.

This patch replaces the per-netconsole_target mutexes with a single
mutex - dynamic_netconsole_mutex.  The reduced granularity doesn't hurt
anything, the code is minutely simpler and this'd allow adding
operations which should be synchronized across all dynamic netconsoles.
