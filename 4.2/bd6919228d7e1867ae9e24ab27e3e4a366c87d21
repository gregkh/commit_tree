md: clear mddev->private when it has been freed.

If ->private is set when ->run is called, it is assumed to be
a 'config'  prepared as part of 'reshape'.

So it is important when we free that config, that we also clear ->private.
This is not often a problem as the mddev will normally be discarded
shortly after the config us freed.
However if an 'assemble' races with a final close, the assemble can use
the old mddev which has a stale ->private.  This leads to any of
various sorts of crashes.

So clear ->private after calling ->free().
