crypto: chacha20 - Add a generic ChaCha20 stream cipher implementation

ChaCha20 is a high speed 256-bit key size stream cipher algorithm designed by
Daniel J. Bernstein. It is further specified in RFC7539 for use in IETF
protocols as a building block for the ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD.

This is a portable C implementation without any architecture specific
optimizations. It uses a 16-byte IV, which includes the 12-byte ChaCha20 nonce
prepended by the initial block counter. Some algorithms require an explicit
counter value, for example the mentioned AEAD construction.
