drm/amdgpu: implement the allocation range (v3)

Pass a ttm_placement pointer to amdgpu_bo_create_restricted
add min_offset to amdgpu_bo_pin_restricted.  This makes it
easier to allocate memory with address restrictions.  With
this patch we can also enable 2-ended allocation again.

v2: fix rebase conflicts
v3: memset placements before using
