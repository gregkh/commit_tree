staging: rtl8188eu: document enum where it is declared

The comment "/* open system */" is repeated verbatim in several places where
dot11AuthAlgrthm_Open is referenced, but not where it is declared.

Move it to be only at its declaration.

This also fixes some "line over 80 characters" checkpatch warnings.
