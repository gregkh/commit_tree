drm/i915/gen8: Update pdp switch and point unused PDPs to scratch page

One important part of this patch is we now write a scratch page
directory into any unused PDP descriptors. This matters for 2 reasons,
first, we're not allowed to just use 0, or an invalid pointer, and second,
we must wipe out any previous contents from the last context.

The latter point only matters with full PPGTT. The former point only
effect platforms with less than 4GB memory.

v2: Updated commit message to point that we must set unused PDPs to the
scratch page.

v3: Unmap scratch_pd in gen8_ppgtt_free.

v4: Initialize scratch_pd. (Mika)
