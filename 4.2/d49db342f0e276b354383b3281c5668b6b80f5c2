sched/fair: Test list head instead of list entry in throttle_cfs_rq()

According to the comments, we need to test if this is
the first throttled task, however, list_empty() tests on
the entry cfs_rq->throttled_list, not the head, this is wrong.

This is a bug because we don't re-init the list entry after
removing it from the list, so list_empty() could return false
even if the list is really empty.
