be2net: Report a "link down" to the stack when a fatal error or fw reset happens.

When an error (related to HW or FW) is detected on a function, the driver
must pro-actively report a "link down" to the stack so that a possible
failover can be initiated. This is being done currently only for some
HW errors. This patch reports a "link down" even for fatal FW errors and
EEH errors.
