ARM: dts: Add minimal support for LogicPD Torpedo DM3730 devkit

The LogicPD Torpedo DM3730 devkit consists of a base board and
two processor boards. One of the processor boards has a WLAN and
the other one does not.

Let's set up basic dts file so we can move to device tree only
based booting over next few merge windows. So far I've tested
that UARTs, MMC1, USB OTG, smsc911x, and basic PM support works.

Note that the wireless support in kernel for wl1283 seems to be
broken, it tries to load wl127x-nvs.bin instead of wl128x-nvs.bin
with firmware.
