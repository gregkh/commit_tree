rcu: Make RCU able to tolerate undefined CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT

This commit introduces an RCU_FANOUT C-preprocessor macro so that RCU will
build even when CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT is undefined.  The RCU_FANOUT macro is
set to the value of CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT when defined, otherwise it is set
to 32 for 32-bit systems and 64 for 64-bit systems.  This commit then
makes CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT depend on CONFIG_RCU_EXPERT, so that Kconfig
users won't be asked about CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT unless they want to be.
