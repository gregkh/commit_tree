perf stat: Add id into perf_stat struct

We need fast way to identify evsel as transaction event for shadow
counters computation. Currently we are using possition (in evlist) based
way.

Adding 'id' into 'struct perf_stat' so it can carry transaction event ID
and we can use it for shadow counters computations.
