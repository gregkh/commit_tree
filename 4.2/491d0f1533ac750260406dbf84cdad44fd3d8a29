switchdev: introduce switchdev add/del obj ops

Like switchdev attr get/set, add new switchdev obj add/del.  switchdev objs
will be things like VLANs or FIB entries, so add/del fits better for
objects than get/set used for attributes.

Use same two-phase prepare-commit transaction model as in attr set.
