tile: support delivering NMIs for multicore backtrace

A new hypervisor service was added some time ago (MDE 4.2.1 or
later, or MDE 4.3 or later) that allows cores to request NMIs
to be delivered to other cores.  Use this facility to deliver
a request that causes a backtrace to be generated on each core,
and hook it into the magic SysRq functionality.
