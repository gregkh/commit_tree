genirq: Revert sparse irq locking around __cpu_up() and move it to x86 for now

Boris reported that the sparse_irq protection around __cpu_up() in the
generic code causes a regression on Xen. Xen allocates interrupts and
some more in the xen_cpu_up() function, so it deadlocks on the
sparse_irq_lock.

There is no simple fix for this and we really should have the
protection for all architectures, but for now the only solution is to
move it to x86 where actual wreckage due to the lack of protection has
been observed.
