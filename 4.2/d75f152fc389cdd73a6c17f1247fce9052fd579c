iommu, x86: Avoid migrating VT-d posted interrupts

When the interrupt is configured in posted mode, the destination of
the interrupt is set in the Posted-Interrupts Descriptor and the
migration of these interrupts happens during vCPU scheduling.

We still update the cached irte, which will be used when changing back
to remapping mode, but we avoid writing the table entry as this would
overwrite the posted mode entry.
