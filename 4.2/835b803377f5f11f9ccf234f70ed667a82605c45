netfilter: nf_tables_netdev: unregister hooks on net_device removal

In case the net_device is gone, we have to unregister the hooks and put back
the reference on the net_device object. Once it comes back, register them
again. This also covers the device rename case.

This patch also adds a new flag to indicate that the basechain is disabled, so
their hooks are not registered. This flag is used by the netdev family to
handle the case where the net_device object is gone. Currently this flag is not
exposed to userspace.
