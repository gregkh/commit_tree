KVM: x86: apply guest MTRR virtualization on host reserved pages

Currently guest MTRR is avoided if kvm_is_reserved_pfn returns true.
However, the guest could prefer a different page type than UC for
such pages. A good example is that pass-throughed VGA frame buffer is
not always UC as host expected.

This patch enables full use of virtual guest MTRRs.
