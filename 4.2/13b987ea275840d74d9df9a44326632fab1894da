fs/ufs: revert "ufs: fix deadlocks introduced by sb mutex merge"

This reverts commit 9ef7db7f38d0 ("ufs: fix deadlocks introduced by sb
mutex merge") That patch tried to solve commit 0244756edc4b98c ("ufs: sb
mutex merge + mutex_destroy") which is itself partially reverted due to
multiple deadlocks.
