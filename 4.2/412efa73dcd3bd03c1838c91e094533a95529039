ASoC: Intel: Get correct usage_count value to load firmware

The usage_count variable was read before it was set to the correct
value, due to which the firmware load was failing. Because of this
IPC messages sent to the firmware were timing out causing a delay
of about 1 second while playing audio from the internal speakers.

With this patch the usage_count is read after the function call
pm_runtime_get_sync which will increment the usage_count variable
and the firmware load is successful and all the IPC messages are
processed correctly.
