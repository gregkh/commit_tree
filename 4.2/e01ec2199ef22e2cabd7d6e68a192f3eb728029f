hv_netvsc: Properly size the vrss queues

The current algorithm for deciding on the number of VRSS channels is
not optimal since we open up the min of number of CPUs online and the
number of VRSS channels the host is offering. So on a 32 VCPU guest
we could potentially open 32 VRSS subchannels. Experimentation has
shown that it is best to limit the number of VRSS channels to the number
of CPUs within a NUMA node.

Here is the new algorithm for deciding on the number of sub-channels we
would open up:
        1) Pick the minimum of what the host is offering and what the driver
           in the guest is specifying as the default value.
        2) Pick the minimum of (1) and the numbers of CPUs in the NUMA
           node the primary channel is bound to.
