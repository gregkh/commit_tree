vt: add cursor blink interval escape sequence

Add an escape sequence to specify the current console's cursor blink
interval. The interval is specified as a number of milliseconds until
the next cursor display state toggle, from 50 to 65535. /proc/loadavg
did not show a difference with a one msec interval, but the lower
bound is set to 50 msecs since slower hardware wasn't tested.

Store the interval in the vc_data structure for later access by fbcon,
initializing the value to fbcon's current hardcoded value of 200 msecs.
