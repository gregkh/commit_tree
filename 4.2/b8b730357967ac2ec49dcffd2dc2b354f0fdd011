mei: consume flow control on the first chunk of writing

Consume the write flow control on the first chunk of the write instead
of on the buffer completion.
We can safely assume that the consequent chunks have the flow control
granted.

This addresses two issues:

1. Blocks other callbacks from the same client riding on the client's
flow control and prevents interleaving of messages as FW cannot distinguish
between two messages from the same client.

2. Fixes single buffer flow control arbitration in a clean way, without
connection/disconnection book keeping
