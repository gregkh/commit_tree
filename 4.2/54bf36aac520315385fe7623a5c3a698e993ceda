KVM: x86: use vcpu-specific functions to read/write/translate GFNs

We need to hide SMRAM from guests not running in SMM.  Therefore,
all uses of kvm_read_guest* and kvm_write_guest* must be changed to
check whether the VCPU is in system management mode and use a
different set of memslots.  Switch from kvm_* to the newly-introduced
kvm_vcpu_*, which call into kvm_arch_vcpu_memslots_id.
