mac80211: remove sta->tx_fragments counter

This counter is unsafe with concurrent TX and is only exposed
through debugfs and ethtool. Instead of trying to fix it just
remove it for now, if it's really needed then it should be
exposed through nl80211 and in a way that drivers that do the
fragmentation in the device could support it as well.
