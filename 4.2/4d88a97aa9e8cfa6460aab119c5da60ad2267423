libnvdimm, nvdimm: dimm driver and base libnvdimm device-driver infrastructure

* Implement the device-model infrastructure for loading modules and
  attaching drivers to nvdimm devices.  This is a simple association of a
  nd-device-type number with a driver that has a bitmask of supported
  device types.  To facilitate userspace bind/unbind operations 'modalias'
  and 'devtype', that also appear in the uevent, are added as generic
  sysfs attributes for all nvdimm devices.  The reason for the device-type
  number is to support sub-types within a given parent devtype, be it a
  vendor-specific sub-type or otherwise.

* The first consumer of this infrastructure is the driver
  for dimm devices.  It simply uses control messages to retrieve and
  store the configuration-data image (label set) from each dimm.

Note: nd_device_register() arranges for asynchronous registration of
      nvdimm bus devices by default.
