ALSA: info: Register proc entries recursively, too

The commit [c560a6797e3b: ALSA: core: Remove child proc file elements
recursively] converted snd_card_proc_new() with the normal
snd_info_*() call and removed snd_device chain for such info
entries. However, it misses one point: the creation of the proc entry
was managed by snd_device chain in the former code, and now it's also
gone, which results in no proc files creation at all.  Mea culpa.

This patch makes snd_info_card_register() creating the all pending
child proc entries in a shot.  Also, since snd_card_register() might
be called multiple times, this function is also changed to be callable
multiple times.

Along with the changes above, now the linked list of snd_info_entry is
added at creation time instead of snd_info_register() for keeping eyes
of pending info entries.
