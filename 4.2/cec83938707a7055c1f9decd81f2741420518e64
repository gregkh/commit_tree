perf tests: Remove getpgrp from mmap-basic

mmap-basic fails on arm64.

 4: read samples using the mmap interface: read samples using the mmap interface: FAILED!

This is because arm64 doesn't come with getpgrp() syscall. The syscall
is a BSD compatibility wrapper, Archs that don't define
__ARCH_WANT_SYS_GETPGRP do not have this. Remove it, since getpgid is
already used in the testcase.
