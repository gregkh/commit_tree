Bluetooth: Reinitialize the list after deletion for session user list

If the user->list is deleted with list_del(), it doesn't initialize the
entry which can cause the issue with list_empty(). According to the
comment from the list.h, list_empty() returns false even if the list is
empty and put the entry in an undefined state.

/**
 * list_del - deletes entry from list.
 * @entry: the element to delete from the list.
 * Note: list_empty() on entry does not return true after this, the entry is
 * in an undefined state.
 */

Because of this behavior, list_empty() returns false even if list is empty
when the device is reconnected.

So, user->list needs to be re-initialized after list_del(). list.h already
have a macro list_del_init() which deletes the entry and initailze it again.
