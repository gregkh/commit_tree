drm/edid: Add DMT modes with ID > 0x50

DMT Version 1.0, Rev. 13 lists a bunch of new modes we don't currently
have in our dmt mode table. So add them.

The order may look a bit weird since it's not sorted based on the DMT
ID, but this is the order they appear in the standard. I suppose they
are ordered by the resolution, pixel clock, or some such factor. I
decided that it's perhaps best to keep the same order as the spec.
