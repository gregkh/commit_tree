powerpc/eeh: Fix trivial error in eeh_restore_dev_state()

Commit 28158cd "powerpc/eeh: Enhance pcibios_set_pcie_reset_state()"
introduced a fix for a problem where certain configurations could lead to
pci_reset_function() destroying the state of PCI devices other than the one
specified.

Unfortunately, the fix has a trivial bug - it calls pci_save_state() again,
when it should be calling pci_restore_state().  This corrects the problem.
