rcutorture: Make rcutorture scripts force RCU_EXPERT

This commit causes the rcutorture scripts to force RCU_EXPERT so that
these scripts can cause rcutorture to torture RCU in the various required
configurations.  However, SRCU-P, TASKS03, and TREE09 retain !RCU_EXPERT
in order to ensure testing of the vanilla configuration.
