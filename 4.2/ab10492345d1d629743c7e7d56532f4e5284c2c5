namei: take increment of nd->depth into pick_link()

Makes the situation much more regular - we avoid a strange state
when the element just after the top of stack is used to store
struct path of symlink, but isn't counted in nd->depth.  This
is much more regular, so the normal failure exits, etc., work
fine.
