Btrfs: fix mutex unlock without prior lock on space cache truncation

If the call to btrfs_truncate_inode_items() failed and we don't have a block
group, we were unlocking the cache_write_mutex without having locked it (we
do it only if we have a block group).

Fixes: 1bbc621ef284 ("Btrfs: allow block group cache writeout
                      outside critical section in commit")
