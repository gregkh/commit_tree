sparc64: perf: Add sanity checking on addresses in user stack

Processes are getting killed (sigbus or segv) while walking userspace
callchains when using perf. In some instances I have seen ufp = 0x7ff
which does not seem like a proper stack address.

This patch adds a function to run validity checks against the address
before attempting the copy_from_user. The checks are copied from the
x86 version as a start point with the addition of a 4-byte alignment
check.
