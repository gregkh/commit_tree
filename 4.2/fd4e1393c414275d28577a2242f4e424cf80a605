tcm_qla2xxx: pass timeout as HZ independent value

API compliance scanning with coccinelle flagged:
./drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/tcm_qla2xxx.c:407:2-29:
         WARNING: timeout is HZ dependent

This was introduced in 'commit 75f8c1f693ee ("[SCSI] tcm_qla2xxx: Add >=
24xx series fabric module for target-core")'. wait_for_completion_timeout()
expects a timeout in jiffies so the numeric constant makes the effective
timeout HZ dependent. Resolved by converting it to CONST * HZ.
