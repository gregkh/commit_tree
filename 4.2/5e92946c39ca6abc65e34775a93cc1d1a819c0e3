iommu/arm-smmu: Skip the execution of CMD_PREFETCH_CONFIG

Hisilicon SMMUv3 devices treat CMD_PREFETCH_CONFIG as a illegal command,
execute it will trigger GERROR interrupt. Although the gerror code manage
to turn the prefetch into a SYNC, and the system can continue to run
normally, but it's ugly to print error information.
