rcutorture: Update TREE_RCU-kconfig.txt

This commit updates TREE_RCU-kconfig.txt to reflect changes in RCU's
Kconfig setup.  This commit also updates rcutorture's Kconfig fragments
to account for Kconfig parameters that are now driven directly off of
other Kconfig parameters.

The #CHECK# prefix tells the rcutorture scripts to take no action to try
to set the Kconfig parameter, but to check that it does in fact get set.
This is useful for verifying that Kconfig parameters that are supposed
to be automatically set do in fact get set to the required values.
