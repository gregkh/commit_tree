block/blk-cgroup.c: free per-blkcg data when freeing the blkcg

Currently, per-blkcg data is freed each time a policy is deactivated,
that is also upon scheduler switch. However, when switching from a
scheduler implementing a policy which requires per-blkcg data to
another one, that same policy might be active on other devices, and
therefore those same per-blkcg data could be still in use.
This commit lets per-blkcg data be freed when the blkcg is freed
instead of on policy deactivation.
