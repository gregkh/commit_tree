arm/mach-keystone: remove legacy __cpuinit sections that crept in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time
ago.  However two crept back in as of commit 5eb3da7246a5b2dfac9f38
("ARM: keystone: Switch over to coherent memory address space")

Since we want to clobber the stubs too, get these removed now.
