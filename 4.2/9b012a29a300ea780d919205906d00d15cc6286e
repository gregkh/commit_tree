Documentation/vm/unevictable-lru.txt: clarify MAP_LOCKED behavior

There is a very subtle difference between mmap()+mlock() vs
mmap(MAP_LOCKED) semantic.  The former one fails if the population of the
area fails while the later one doesn't.  This basically means that
mmap(MAPLOCKED) areas might see major fault after mmap syscall returns
which is not the case for mlock.  mmap man page has already been altered
but Documentation/vm/unevictable-lru.txt deserves a clarification as well.
