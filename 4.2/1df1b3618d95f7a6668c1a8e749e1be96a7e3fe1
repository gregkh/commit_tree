Documentation, intel_pstate: Improve legacy mode internal governors description

The current documentation is incomplete wrt the intel_pstate legacy
internal governors.  The confusion comes from the general cpufreq
governors which also use the names performance and powersave.  This patch
better differentiates between the two sets of governors and gives an
explanation of how the internal P-state governors behave differently from
one another.

Also fix two minor typos.
