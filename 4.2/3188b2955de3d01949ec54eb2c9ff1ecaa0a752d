ovl: rearrange ovl_follow_link to it doesn't need to call ->put_link

ovl_follow_link current calls ->put_link on an error path.
However ->put_link is about to change in a way that it will be
impossible to call it from ovl_follow_link.

So rearrange the code to avoid the need for that error path.
Specifically: move the kmalloc() call before the ->follow_link()
call to the subordinate filesystem.
