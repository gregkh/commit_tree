proc: fix PAGE_SIZE limit of /proc/$PID/cmdline

/proc/$PID/cmdline truncates output at PAGE_SIZE. It is easy to see with

	$ cat /proc/self/cmdline $(seq 1037) 2>/dev/null

However, command line size was never limited to PAGE_SIZE but to 128 KB
and relatively recently limitation was removed altogether.

People noticed and ask questions:

seq file interface is not OK, because it kmalloc's for whole output and
open + read(, 1) + sleep will pin arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.  To
not do that, limit must be imposed which is incompatible with arbitrary
sized command lines.

I apologize for hairy code, but this it direct consequence of command line
layout in memory and hacks to support things like "init [3]".

The loops are "unrolled" otherwise it is either macros which hide control
flow or functions with 7-8 arguments with equal line count.

There should be real setproctitle(2) or something.
