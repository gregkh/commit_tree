cpufreq: Track cpu managing sysfs kobjects separately

In order to prepare for the next few commits, that will stop migrating
sysfs files on cpu hotplug, this patch starts managing sysfs-cpu
separately.

The behavior is still the same as we are still migrating sysfs files on
hotplug, later commits would change that.
