writeback: add wb_writeback_work->auto_free

Currently, a wb_writeback_work is freed automatically on completion if
it doesn't have ->done set.  Add wb_writeback_work->auto_free to make
the switch explicit.  This will help cgroup writeback support where
waiting for completion and whether to free automatically don't
necessarily move together.
