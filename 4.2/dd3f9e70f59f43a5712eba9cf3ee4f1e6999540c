tipc: add packet sequence number at instant of transmission

Currently, the packet sequence number is updated and added to each
packet at the moment a packet is added to the link backlog queue.
This is wasteful, since it forces the code to traverse the send
packet list packet by packet when adding them to the backlog queue.
It would be better to just splice the whole packet list into the
backlog queue when that is the right action to do.

In this commit, we do this change. Also, since the sequence numbers
cannot now be assigned to the packets at the moment they are added
the backlog queue, we do instead calculate and add them at the moment
of transmission, when the backlog queue has to be traversed anyway.
We do this in the function tipc_link_push_packet().
