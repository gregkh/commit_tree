writeback, blkcg: propagate non-root blkcg congestion state

Now that bdi layer can handle per-blkcg bdi_writeback_congested state,
blk_{set|clear}_congested() can propagate non-root blkcg congestion
state to them.

This can be easily achieved by disabling the root_rl tests in
blk_{set|clear}_congested().  Note that we still need those tests when
!CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK as otherwise we'll end up flipping root blkcg
wb's congestion state for events happening on other blkcgs.

v2: Updated for bdi_writeback_congested.
