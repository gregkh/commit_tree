s390/sclp: unify basic sclp access by exposing "struct sclp"

Let's unify basic access to sclp fields by storing the data in an external
struct in asm/sclp.h.

The values can now directly be accessed by other components, so there is
no need for most accessor functions and external variables anymore.

The mtid, mtid_max and facility part will be cleaned up separately.
