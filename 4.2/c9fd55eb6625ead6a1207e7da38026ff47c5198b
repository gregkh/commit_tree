xen/xenbus: client: Fix call of virt_to_mfn in xenbus_grant_ring

virt_to_mfn should take a void* rather an unsigned long. While it
doesn't really matter now, it would throw a compiler warning later when
virt_to_mfn will enforce the type.

At the same time, avoid to compute new virtual address every time in the
loop and directly increment the parameter as we don't use it later.
