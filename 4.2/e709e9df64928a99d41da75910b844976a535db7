ext4 crypto: encrypt tmpfile located in encryption protected directory

Factor out calls to ext4_inherit_context() and move them to
__ext4_new_inode(); this fixes a problem where ext4_tmpfile() wasn't
calling calling ext4_inherit_context(), so the temporary file wasn't
getting protected.  Since the blocks for the tmpfile could end up on
disk, they really should be protected if the tmpfile is created within
the context of an encrypted directory.
