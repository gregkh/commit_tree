crypto: marvell/cesa - add allhwsupport module parameter

The old and new marvell CESA drivers both support Orion and Kirkwood SoCs.
Add a module parameter to choose whether these SoCs should be attached to
the new or the old driver.

The default policy is to keep attaching those IPs to the old driver if it
is enabled, until we decide the new CESA driver is stable/secure enough.
