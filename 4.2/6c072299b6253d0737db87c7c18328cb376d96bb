samsung-laptop: Port to new backlight interface selection API

Port the backlight selection logic to the new backlight interface
selection API.

This commit also removes various obsolete pr_xxx messages related to
backlight interface selection. These are obsolete because they assume
there is only a vendor or acpi backlight driver and no other choice.
Also they are not necessary, if the user wants to know which backlight
interfaces are registered a simple "ls /sys/class/backlight" suffices.
