spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Enable TCF interrupt mode support

DSPI module has two optional interrupts when complete data transfer.
One is EOQ interrupt, the other one is TCF interrupt.
EOQ indicates a queue of data frame has been transmitted.
TCF indicates a frame has been transmitted.
This patch enable support TCF mode.
Driver binds a correct interrupt mode to every compatible string.
User should use the correct compatible string in the dts node.
