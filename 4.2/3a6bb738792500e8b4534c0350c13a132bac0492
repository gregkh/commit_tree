nfs: convert setclientid and exchange_id encoders to use clp->cl_owner_id

...instead of buffers that are part of their arg structs. We already
hold a reference to the client, so we might as well use the allocated
buffer. In the event that we can't allocate the clp->cl_owner_id, then
just return -ENOMEM.

Note too that we switch from a GFP_KERNEL allocation here to GFP_NOFS.
It's possible we could end up trying to do a SETCLIENTID or EXCHANGE_ID
in order to reclaim some memory, and the GFP_KERNEL allocations in the
existing code could cause recursion back into NFS reclaim.
