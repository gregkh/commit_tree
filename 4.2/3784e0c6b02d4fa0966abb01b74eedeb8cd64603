PCI: pciehp: Clean up debug logging

The pciehp debug logging is overly verbose and often redundant.  Almost all
of the information printed by dbg_ctrl() is also printed by the normal PCI
core enumeration code and by pcie_init().

Remove the redundant debug info.

When claiming a pciehp bridge, we print the slot characteristics, e.g.,

  Slot #6 AttnBtn- AttnInd- PwrInd- PwrCtrl- MRL- Interlock- NoCompl+ LLActRep+

Add the Hot-Plug Capable and Hot-Plug Surprise bits to this information,
and print it all in the same order as lspci does.

No functional change except the message text changes.
