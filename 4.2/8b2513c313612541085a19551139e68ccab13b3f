HID: sony: PS Move fix report descriptor

Fix the report descriptor so that the buttons and trigger are correctly reported.

The format of the input report is described here:
https://github.com/nitsch/moveonpc/wiki/Input-report

The Accelerometers and Gyros (1st frame only) are also reported as axis, but
the Magnetometers are NOT as 'fixing' their byte order would break user-space
drivers such as PSMoveAPI.

It is hoped to resolve this at a future time.
