printk: guard the amount written per line by devkmsg_read()

This patchset updates netconsole so that it can emit messages with the
same header as used in /dev/kmsg which gives neconsole receiver full log
information which enables things like structured logging and detection
of lost messages.

This patch (of 7):

devkmsg_read() uses 8k buffer and assumes that the formatted output
message won't overrun which seems safe given LOG_LINE_MAX, the current use
of dict and the escaping method being used; however, we're planning to use
devkmsg formatting wider and accounting for the buffer size properly isn't
that complicated.

This patch defines CONSOLE_EXT_LOG_MAX as 8192 and updates devkmsg_read()
so that it limits output accordingly.
