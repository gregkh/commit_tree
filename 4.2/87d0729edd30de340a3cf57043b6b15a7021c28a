mips/mm/tlbex: remove new instance of __cpuinit that crept back in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time ago.
However a new instance was added in commit c5b367835cfc7a8ef53b9670a409ff
("MIPS: Add support for XPA.")

Since we want to clobber the stubs soon, get this removed now.
