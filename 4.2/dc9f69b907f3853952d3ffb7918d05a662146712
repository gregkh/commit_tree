iwlwifi: mvm: Fix regular scan priority

The code checks the total number of iterations to differentiate
between regular scan and scheduled scan. However, regular scan has
a total of one iteration, not zero. As a result, regular scan will
have lower priority than it should have, and in case scheduled
scan is already running when regular scan is requested, regular scan
will be delayed until scheduled scan is aborted.
Fix that by checking for total iterations number of one as an
identifier for regular scan.
