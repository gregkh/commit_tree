gpio: sysfs: release irq after class-device deregistration

Make sure to release any irq only after the class device has been
deregistered.

This avoids a race between gpiod_unexport and edge_store, where an irq
could be allocated just before the gpio class device is deregistered
without relying on FLAG_EXPORT and the global sysfs lock.

Note that there is no need to hold the sysfs lock when releasing the irq
after the class device is gone as kernfs will prevent further attribute
operations.
