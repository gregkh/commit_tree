ALSA: firewire-lib: pass the number of data blocks in incoming packets to outgoing packets

Current implementation reuses the value of syt field in incoming packet to
outgoing packet for full duplex timestamp synchronization, while the number
of data blocks in outgoing packets refers to hard-coded table and the
synchronization cannot be applied to non-blocking stream.

This commit passes the number of data blocks from incoming packet
processing to outgoing packet processing for the synchronization. For
normal mode, isochronous callback handler is changed to generate the values
of syt and data blocks.
