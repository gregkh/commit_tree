serial: sirf: fix the issue that HW flow control doesn't work for BT

>From HW spec, when rxfifo's data is less than AFC_RX_THD(RX threshhold), RTS
signal is active. otherwise, RTS signal is inactive.

Crrently the RX threshhold is set as zero, so RTS has no chance to be
active. This patch replaces the default 0 by a positive number.
