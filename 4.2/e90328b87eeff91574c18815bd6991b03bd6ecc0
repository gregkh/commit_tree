mce: Stop using array-index-based RCU primitives

Because mce is arch-specific x86 code, there is little or no
performance benefit of using rcu_dereference_index_check() over using
smp_load_acquire().  It also turns out that mce is the only place that
array-index-based RCU is used, and it would be convenient to drop
this portion of the RCU API.

This patch therefore changes rcu_dereference_index_check() uses to
smp_load_acquire(), but keeping the lockdep diagnostics, and also
changes rcu_access_index() uses to READ_ONCE().
