net/ps3_gelic: Fix build error with DEBUG

When the DEBUG preprocessor macro is defined the ps3_gelic_net driver build
fails due to an undeclared routine gelic_descr_get_status().  This problem
was introduced during the code cleanup of commit
6b0c21cede22be1f68f0a632c0ca38008ce1abe7 (net: Fix p3_gelic_net sparse warnings),
which re-arranged the ordering of some of the gelic routines.

This change just moves the gelic_descr_get_status() routine up in the
ps3_gelic_net.c source file. There is no functional change.

Fixes build errors like these:

  drivers/net/ethernet/toshiba/ps3_gelic_net.c: error: implicit declaration of function gelic_descr_get_status
