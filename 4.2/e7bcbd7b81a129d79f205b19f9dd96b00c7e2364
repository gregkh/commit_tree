be2net: add support for spoofchk setting

This patch adds support for spoofchk configuration for VFs.
When it is enabled, "spoof checking" is done for both MAC-address and VLAN.
For each VF, the HW ensures that the source MAC address (or vlan) of
every outgoing packet exists in the MAC-list (or vlan-list) configured
for RX filtering for that VF. If not, the packet is dropped and an error
is reported to the driver in the TX completion; this is reflected in the
"tx_spoof_check_err" ethtool counter.
This feature is supported in Skyhawk FW version 10.6.31.0 and above.
