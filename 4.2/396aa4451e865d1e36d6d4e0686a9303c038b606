drm: Fix for DP CTS test 4.2.2.5 - I2C DEFER handling

For test 4.2.2.5 to pass per the Link CTS Core 1.2 rev1.1 spec, the source
device must attempt at least 7 times to read the EDID when it receives an
I2C defer. The normal DRM code makes only 7 retries, regardless of whether
or not the response is a native defer or an I2C defer. Test 4.2.2.5 fails
since there are native defers interspersed with the I2C defers which
results in less than 7 EDID read attempts.

The solution is to add the numer of defers to the retry counter when an I2C
DEFER is returned such that another read attempt will be made. This situation
should normally only occur in compliance testing, however, as a worse case
real-world scenario, it would result in 13 attempts ( 6 native defers, 7 I2C
defers) for a single transaction to complete. The net result is a slightly
slower response to an EDID read that shouldn't significantly impact overall
performance.

V2:
- Added a check on the number of I2C Defers to limit the number
  of times that the retries variable will be decremented. This
  is to address review feedback regarding possible infinite loops
  from misbehaving sink devices.
V3:
- Fixed the limit value to 7 instead of 8 to get the correct retry
  count.
- Combined the increment of the defer count into the if-statement
V4:
- Removed i915 tag from subject as the patch is not i915-specific
V5:
- Updated the for-loop to add the number of i2c defers to the retry
  counter such that the correct number of retry attempts will be
  made
