ipv6: drop unneeded goto

Delete jump to a label on the next line, when that label is not
used elsewhere.

A simplified version of the semantic patch that makes this change is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@r@
identifier l;
@@

-if (...) goto l;
-l:
// </smpl>

Also remove the unnecessary ret variable.
