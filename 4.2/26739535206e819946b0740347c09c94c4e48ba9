crypto: skcipher - Fix corner case in crypto_lookup_skcipher

When the user explicitly states that they don't care whether the
algorithm has been tested (type = CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED and mask = 0),
there is a corner case where we may erroneously return ENOENT.

This patch fixes it by correcting the logic in the test.
