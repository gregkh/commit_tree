writeback: update wb_over_bg_thresh() to use wb_domain aware operations

wb_over_bg_thresh() currently uses global_dirty_limits() and
wb_dirty_limit() both of which are wrappers around operations which
take dirty_throttle_control.  For cgroup writeback support, the
function will be updated to also consider memcg wb_domains which
requires the context information carried in dirty_throttle_control.

This patch updates wb_over_bg_thresh() so that it uses the underlying
wb_domain aware operations directly and builds the global
dirty_throttle_control in the process.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavioral changes.
