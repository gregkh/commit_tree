ipv6: Remove DST_METRICS_FORCE_OVERWRITE and _rt6i_peer

_rt6i_peer is no longer needed after the last patch,
'ipv6: Stop rt6_info from using inet_peer's metrics'.

DST_METRICS_FORCE_OVERWRITE is added by
commit e5fd387ad5b3 ("ipv6: do not overwrite inetpeer metrics prematurely").
Since inetpeer is no longer used for metrics, this bit is also not needed.
