scsi_transport_srp: Reduce failover time

Unlike FC, there is no risk that SCSI devices will be offlined
by the SCSI error handler if the SCSI error handler is started
while a reconnect attempt is ongoing. Hence report timeout errors
as soon as possible if a higher software layer (e.g. multipathd)
needs to be informed about a timeout. It is assumed that if both
fast_io_fail_tmo < 0 and rport->dev_loss_tmo < 0 that this means
that there is no need to report timeouts quickly.
