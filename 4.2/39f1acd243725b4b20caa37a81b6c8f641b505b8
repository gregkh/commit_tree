x86/fpu/xstate: Don't assume the first zero xfeatures zero bit means the end

The current xstate code in setup_xstate_features() assumes that
the first zero bit means the end of xfeatures - but that is not
so, the SDM clearly states that an arbitrary set of xfeatures
might be enabled - and it is also clear from the description
of the compaction feature that holes are possible:

  "13-6 Vol. 1MANAGING STATE USING THE XSAVE FEATURE SET
  [...]

  Compacted format. Each state component i (i ≥ 2) is located at a byte
  offset from the base address of the XSAVE area based on the XCOMP_BV
  field in the XSAVE header:

  — If XCOMP_BV[i] = 0, state component i is not in the XSAVE area.

  — If XCOMP_BV[i] = 1, the following items apply:

  • If XCOMP_BV[j] = 0 for every j, 2 ≤ j < i, state component i is
    located at a byte offset 576 from the base address of the XSAVE
    area. (This item applies if i is the first bit set in bits 62:2 of
    the XCOMP_BV; it implies that state component i is located at the
    beginning of the extended region.)

  • Otherwise, let j, 2 ≤ j < i, be the greatest value such that
    XCOMP_BV[j] = 1. Then state component i is located at a byte offset
    X from the location of state component j, where X is the number of
    bytes required for state component j as enumerated in
    CPUID.(EAX=0DH,ECX=j):EAX. (This item implies that state component i
    immediately follows the preceding state component whose bit is set
    in XCOMP_BV.)"

So don't assume that the first zero xfeatures bit means the end of
all xfeatures - iterate through all of them.

I'm not aware of hardware that triggers this currently.
