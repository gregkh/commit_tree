ACPI / ARM64 : use the new BAD_MADT_GICC_ENTRY macro

For those parts of the arm64 ACPI code that need to check GICC subtables
in the MADT, use the new BAD_MADT_GICC_ENTRY macro instead of the previous
BAD_MADT_ENTRY.  The new macro takes into account differences in the size
of the GICC subtable that the old macro did not; this caused failures even
though the subtable entries are valid.
