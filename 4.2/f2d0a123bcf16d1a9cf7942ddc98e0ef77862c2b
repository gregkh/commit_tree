mnt: Clarify and correct the disconnect logic in umount_tree

rmdir mntpoint will result in an infinite loop when there is
a mount locked on the mountpoint in another mount namespace.

This is because the logic to test to see if a mount should
be disconnected in umount_tree is buggy.

Move the logic to decide if a mount should remain connected to
it's mountpoint into it's own function disconnect_mount so that
clarity of expression instead of terseness of expression becomes
a virtue.

When the conditions where it is invalid to leave a mount connected
are first ruled out, the logic for deciding if a mount should
be disconnected becomes much clearer and simpler.
