dmaengine: mv_xor: bug fix for racing condition in descriptors cleanup

This patch fixes a bug in the XOR driver where the cleanup function can be
called and free descriptors that never been processed by the engine (which
result in data errors).

The cleanup function will free descriptors based on the ownership bit in
the descriptors.
