lpfc: Fix to drop PLOGIs from fabric node till LOGO processing completes

The domain controller PLOGI's concurrent with prior LOGO's/unreg_rpi's
completing created a race condition where driver rpi ref count can
inadvertantly hit 0 and the rpi attempted to be freed. This error
sometimes resulted in Warning messages indicating kref.h via
lfpc_nlp_get+0x128.

Correct by dropping any new PLOGI until the prior nport state has settled.
