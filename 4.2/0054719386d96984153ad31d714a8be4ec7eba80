powerpc/iommu/ioda2: Add get_table_size() to calculate the size of future table

This adds a way for the IOMMU user to know how much a new table will
use so it can be accounted in the locked_vm limit before allocation
happens.

This stores the allocated table size in pnv_pci_ioda2_get_table_size()
so the locked_vm counter can be updated correctly when a table is
being disposed.

This defines an iommu_table_group_ops callback to let VFIO know
how much memory will be locked if a table is created.
