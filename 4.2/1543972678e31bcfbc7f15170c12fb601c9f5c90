namei: have terminate_walk() do put_link() on everything left

All callers of terminate_walk() are followed by more or less
open-coded eqiuvalent of "do put_link() on everything left
in nd->stack".  Better done in terminate_walk() itself, and
when we go for RCU symlink traversal we'll have to do it
there anyway.
