vlan: Add GRO support for non hardware accelerated vlan

Currently packets with non-hardware-accelerated vlan cannot be handled
by GRO. This causes low performance for 802.1ad and stacked vlan, as their
vlan tags are currently not stripped by hardware.

This patch adds GRO support for non-hardware-accelerated vlan and
improves receive performance of them.

Test Environment:
 vlan device (.1Q) on vlan device (.1ad) on ixgbe (82599)
