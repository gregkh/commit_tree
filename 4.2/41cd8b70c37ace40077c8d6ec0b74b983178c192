libnvdimm, btt: add support for blk integrity

Support multiple block sizes (sector + metadata) using the blk integrity
framework. This registers a new integrity template that defines the
protection information tuple size based on the configured metadata size,
and simply acts as a passthrough for protection information generated by
another layer. The metadata is written to the storage as-is, and read back
with each sector.
