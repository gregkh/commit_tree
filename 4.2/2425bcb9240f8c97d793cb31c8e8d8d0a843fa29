tracing: Rename ftrace_event_{call,class} to trace_event_{call,class}

The name "ftrace" really refers to the function hook infrastructure. It
is not about the trace_events. The structures ftrace_event_call and
ftrace_event_class have nothing to do with the function hooks, and are
really trace_event structures. Rename ftrace_event_* to trace_event_*.
