ARM: pxa: change clocks init sequence

Since pxa clocks were ported to the clock framework, an ordering issue
appears between clocks and clocksource initialization. As a consequence,
the pxa timer clock cannot be acquired in pxa_timer, and is disabled by
clock framework because it is "unused".

The ordering issue is that in the kernel boot sequence :
  start_kernel()
    ...
    time_init()
      -> pxa_timer()
        -> here the clocksource is initialized
    ...
    rest_init()
      kernel_init()
	initcalls
	  -> here the clocks are initialized

In the current sequence, the clocks are initialized way after pxa_timer,
which cannot acquire the OSTIMER0 clock.

To solve this issue, the clocks initialization is moved to pxa_timer(),
so that clocks are initialized before clocksource for non device-tree.
For device-tree, the standard arm time_init() will take care of the
ordering.
