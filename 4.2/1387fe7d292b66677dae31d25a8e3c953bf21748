MIPS: BCM47xx: Extract all boardflags to new u32 fields

For years we planned to get rid of old u16 fields, let's start doing it
with MIPS code. This process will take some time, it requires doing the
same in ssb/bcma and then switching all drivers to new fields. This will
be handled in separated patches submitted to appropriate trees.
