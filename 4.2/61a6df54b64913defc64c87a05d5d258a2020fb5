KVM: s390: call exit_sie() directly on vcpu block/request

Thinking about it, I can't find a real use case where we want
to block a VCPU and not kick it out of SIE. (except if we want
to do the same in batch for multiple VCPUs - but that's a micro
optimization)

So let's simply perform the exit_sie() calls directly when setting
the other magic block bits in the SIE.

Otherwise e.g. kvm_s390_set_tod_low() still has other VCPUs running
after that call, working with a wrong epoch.
