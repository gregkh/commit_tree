libata: add ATA_HORKAGE_MAX_SEC_1024 to revert back to previous max_sectors limit

Since no longer limiting max_sectors to BLK_DEF_MAX_SECTORS (commit 34b48db66e08),
data corruption may occur on ST380013AS drive configured on 82801JI (ICH10 Family)
SATA controller. This patch will allow the driver to limit max_sectors as before

 # cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/max_sectors_kb
 512

I was able to double the max_sectors_kb value up to 16384 on linux-4.2.0-rc2
before seeing corruption, but seems safer to use previous limit. Without this
patch max_sectors_kb will be 32767.

tj: Minor comment update.
