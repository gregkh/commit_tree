x86/kconfig: Bump default NR_CPUS from 8 to 64 for 64-bit configuration

Default NR_CPUS==8 is not enough to cover high-end desktop
configuration: Haswell-E has upto 16 threads.

Let's increase default NR_CPUS to 64 on 64-bit configuration.
With this value CPU bitmask will still fit into one unsigned long.

Default for 32-bit configuration is still 8: it's unlikely
anybody will run 32-bit kernels on modern hardware.

As an alternative we could bump NR_CPUS to 128 to cover all
dual-processor servers with some margin.

For reference: Debian and Suse build their kernels with
NR_CPUS==512, Fedora -- 1024.
