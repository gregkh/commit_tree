ARM: redo TTBR setup code for LPAE

Re-engineer the LPAE TTBR setup code.  Rather than passing some shifted
address in order to fit in a CPU register, pass either a full physical
address (in the case of r4, r5 for TTBR0) or a PFN (for TTBR1).

This removes the ARCH_PGD_SHIFT hack, and the last dangerous user of
cpu_set_ttbr() in the secondary CPU startup code path (which was there
to re-set TTBR1 to the appropriate high physical address space on
Keystone2.)
