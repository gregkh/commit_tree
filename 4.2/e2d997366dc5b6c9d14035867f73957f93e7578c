ARM: kvm: psci: fix handling of unimplemented functions

According to the PSCI specification and the SMC/HVC calling
convention, PSCI function_ids that are not implemented must
return NOT_SUPPORTED as return value.

Current KVM implementation takes an unhandled PSCI function_id
as an error and injects an undefined instruction into the guest
if PSCI implementation is called with a function_id that is not
handled by the resident PSCI version (ie it is not implemented),
which is not the behaviour expected by a guest when calling a
PSCI function_id that is not implemented.

This patch fixes this issue by returning NOT_SUPPORTED whenever
the kvm PSCI call is executed for a function_id that is not
implemented by the PSCI kvm layer.
