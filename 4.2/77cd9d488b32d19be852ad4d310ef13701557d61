fuse: add req flag for private list

When an unlocked request is aborted, it is moved from fpq->io to a private
list.  Then, after unlocking fpq->lock, the private list is processed and
the requests are finished off.

To protect the private list, we need to mark the request with a flag, so if
in the meantime the request is unlocked the list is not corrupted.
