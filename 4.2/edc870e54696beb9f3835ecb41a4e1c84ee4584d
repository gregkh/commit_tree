pmem: make_request cleanups

Various cleanups:

1/ Kill the BUG_ON since we've already told the block layer we don't
   support DISCARD on all these drivers.

2/ Kill the 'rw' variable, no need to cache it.

3/ Kill the local 'sector' variable.  bio_for_each_segment() is already
   advancing the iterator's sector number by the bio_vec length.

4/ Kill the check for accessing past the end of device
   generic_make_request_checks() already does that.
