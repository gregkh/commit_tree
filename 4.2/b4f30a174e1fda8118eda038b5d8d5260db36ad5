mmc: core: Allow card drive strength to be different to host

Initialization of UHS-I modes for SD and SDIO cards
employs a callback to allow the host driver to
choose a drive strength value. Currently that
assumes the card drive strength and host driver
type must be the same value. Change to let the
callback make that decision and return both the
card drive strength and host driver type.
