drm/crtc: Fix edid length computation

The length of each EDID block is EDID_LENGTH, and number of blocks is
(1 + edid->extensions) - we need to multiply not add them.

This causes wrong EDID to be passed on, and is a regression introduced
by d2ed34362a52 (drm: Introduce helper for replacing blob properties)
