libnvdimm: Set numa_node to NVDIMM devices

ACPI NFIT table has System Physical Address Range Structure entries that
describe a proximity ID of each range when ACPI_NFIT_PROXIMITY_VALID is
set in the flags.

Change acpi_nfit_register_region() to map a proximity ID to its node ID,
and set it to a new numa_node field of nd_region_desc, which is then
conveyed to the nd_region device.

The device core arranges for btt and namespace devices to inherit their
node from their parent region.
