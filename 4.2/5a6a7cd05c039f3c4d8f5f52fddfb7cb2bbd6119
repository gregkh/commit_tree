drivers/hwtracing: fix coresight-replicator-qcom implicit <module.h> usage

In commit 620cf787c121f39b5223e43bad3d1b7c66ecead5 ("coresight: replicator:
Add Qualcomm CoreSight Replicator driver") this driver was added.

It uses module_amba_driver(replicator_driver) to register itself with
the system -- which is just an alias for module_driver.  This currently
works by relying on getting that via init.h but we are planning to move
that code[1] to module.h -- at which time this will fail to compile since
it does not include module.h currently, resulting in:

drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-replicator-qcom.c:214:1: error: type defaults to 'int' in declaration of 'module_init' [-Werror=implicit-int]
drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-replicator-qcom.c:214:1: error: type defaults to 'int' in declaration of 'module_exit' [-Werror=implicit-int]

In the future, the amba support may want to create another alias that
uses builtin_driver[2] for cases like this which are using bool Kconfig
triggers, but for now we just fix the implicit include.
