vhost: add max_mem_regions module parameter

it became possible to use a bigger amount of memory
slots, which is used by memory hotplug for
registering hotplugged memory.
However QEMU crashes if it's used with more than ~60
pc-dimm devices and vhost-net enabled since host kernel
in module vhost-net refuses to accept more than 64
memory regions.

Allow to tweak limit via max_mem_regions module paramemter
with default value set to 64 slots.
