x86/cpu: Strip any /proc/cpuinfo model name field whitespace

When comparing the 'model name' field of each core in
/proc/cpuinfo it was noticed that there is a whitespace
difference between the cores' model names.

After some quick investigation it was noticed that the model
name fields were actually different -- processor 0's model name
field had trailing whitespace removed, while the other
processors did not.

Another way of seeing this behaviour is to convert spaces into
underscores in the output of /proc/cpuinfo,

  [thetango@prarit ~]# grep "^model name" /proc/cpuinfo | uniq -c | sed 's/\ /_/g'
  ______1_model_name      :_AMD_Opteron(TM)_Processor_6272
  _____63_model_name      :_AMD_Opteron(TM)_Processor_6272_________________

which shows the discrepancy.

This occurs because the kernel calls strim() on cpu 0's
x86_model_id field to output a pretty message to the console in
print_cpu_info(), and as a result strips the whitespace at the
end of the ->x86_model_id field.

But, the ->x86_model_id field should be the same for the all
identical CPUs in the box. Thus, we need to remove both leading
and trailing whitespace.

As a result, the print_cpu_info() output looks like

  smpboot: CPU0: AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6272 (fam: 15, model: 01, stepping: 02)

and the x86_model_id field is correct on all processors on AMD
platforms:

  _____64_model_name      :_AMD_Opteron(TM)_Processor_6272

Output is still correct on an Intel box:

  ____144_model_name      :_Intel(R)_Xeon(R)_CPU_E7-8890_v3_@_2.50GHz
