intel_pstate: Add tsc collection and keep previous target pstate

The intel_pstate driver is difficult to debug and investigate without tsc.

Also, it is likely use of tsc, and some version of C0 percentage,
will be re-introdcued in futute.

There have also been occasions where it is desirebale to know, and
confirm, the previous target pstate.

This patch brings back tsc, adds previous target pstate,
and adds both to the trace data collection.
