rcu: Break dependency of RCU_FANOUT_LEAF on RCU_FANOUT

RCU_FANOUT_LEAF's range and default values depend on the value of
RCU_FANOUT, which at the time seemed like a cute way to save two lines
of Kconfig code.  However, adding a dependency from both of these
Kconfig parameters on RCU_EXPERT requires that RCU_FANOUT_LEAF operate
correctly even if RCU_FANOUT is undefined.  This commit therefore
allows RCU_FANOUT_LEAF to take on the full range of permitted values,
even in cases where RCU_FANOUT is undefined.
