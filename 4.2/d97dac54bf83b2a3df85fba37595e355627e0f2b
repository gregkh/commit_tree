net/rds: Add setsockopt support for SO_RDS_TRANSPORT

An application may deterministically attach the underlying transport for
a PF_RDS socket by invoking setsockopt(2) with the SO_RDS_TRANSPORT
option at the SOL_RDS level. The integer argument to setsockopt must be
one of the RDS_TRANS_* transport types, e.g., RDS_TRANS_TCP. The option
must be specified before invoking bind(2) on the socket, and may only
be used once on the socket. An attempt to set the option on a bound
socket, or to invoke the option after a successful SO_RDS_TRANSPORT
attachment, will return EOPNOTSUPP.
