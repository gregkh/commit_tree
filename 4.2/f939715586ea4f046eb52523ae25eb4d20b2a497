perf auxtrace: Add a heap for sorting AUX area tracing queues

In order to process AUX area tracing data in time order, the queue with
data with the lowest timestamp must be processed first.  Provide a heap
to keep track of which queue that is.

As with the queues, a decoder does not have to use the heap, but Intel
BTS and Intel PT will use it.
