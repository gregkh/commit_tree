staging: comedi: wrap COMEDI_SRF_FREE_SPRIV usage

The `COMEDI_SRF_FREE_SPRIV` flag in the `runflags` member of `struct
comedi_subdevice` indicates that the memory pointed to by the `private`
member can be automatically freed by the comedi core on subdevice
clean-up (when the low-level comedi device is being "detached").  the
flag doesn't really belong in `runflags`, but it was somewhere
convenient to keep it without having to add a new member to the
structure.

Rather than access the `COMEDI_SRF_FREE_SPRIV` flag directly, use some
new wrapper functions:

* comedi_can_auto_free_spriv(s) - checks whether the subdevice's
  `s->private` points to memory that can be freed automatically.
* comedi_set_spriv_auto_free(s) - marks the subdevice as having a
  `s->private` that points to memory that can be freed automatically.

Export `comedi_set_spriv_auto_free()` for use by the low-level comedi
driver modules, in particular the "amplc_dio200_common" module.
