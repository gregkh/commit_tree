iwlwifi: pcie: don't call set_pwr functions for family 8000

We should not call the iwl_pcie_set_pwr() functions in the
suspend/resume flows for family 8000, because the register used is
locked in devices from this family.  Doing this causes an NMI
protection error (RT_NMI_INTERRUPT_PREG_PROTECTION).

To fix this, skip those calls if the device family is
IWL_DEVICE_FAMILY_8000.
