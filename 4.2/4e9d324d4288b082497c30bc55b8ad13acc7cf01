MIPS: Require O32 FP64 support for MIPS64 with O32 compat

MIPS32r6 code requires FP64 (ie. FR=1) support. Building a kernel with
support for MIPS32r6 binaries but without support for O32 with FP64 is
therefore a problem which can lead to incorrectly executed userland.

CONFIG_MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT is already selected when the kernel is
configured for MIPS32r6, but not when the kernel is configured for
MIPS64r6 with O32 compat support. Select CONFIG_MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT in
such configurations to prevent building kernels which execute MIPS32r6
userland incorrectly.
