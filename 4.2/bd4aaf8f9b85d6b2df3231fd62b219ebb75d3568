dm: fix dm_merge_bvec regression on 32 bit systems

A DM regression on 32 bit systems was reported against v4.2-rc3 here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/29/401

Fix this by reverting both commit 1c220c69 ("dm: fix casting bug in
dm_merge_bvec()") and 148e51ba ("dm: improve documentation and code
clarity in dm_merge_bvec").  This combined revert is done to eliminate
the possibility of a partial revert in stable@ kernels.

In hindsight the correct fix, at the time 1c220c69 was applied to fix
the regression that 148e51ba introduced, should've been to simply revert
148e51ba.
