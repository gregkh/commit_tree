perf/x86/intel/bts: Fix DS area sharing with x86_pmu events

Currently, the intel_bts driver relies on the DS area allocated by the x86_pmu
code in its event_init() path, which is a bug: creating a BTS event while
no x86_pmu events are present results in a NULL pointer dereference.

The same DS area is also used by PEBS sampling, which makes it quite a bit
trickier to have a separate one for intel_bts' purposes.

This patch makes intel_bts driver use the same DS allocation and reference
counting code as x86_pmu to make sure it is always present when either
intel_bts or x86_pmu need it.
