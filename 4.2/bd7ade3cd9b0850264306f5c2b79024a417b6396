bufferhead: Add _gfp version for sb_getblk()

sb_getblk() is used during ext4 (and possibly other FSes) writeback
paths. Sometimes such path require allocating memory and guaranteeing
that such allocation won't block. Currently, however, there is no way
to provide user flags for sb_getblk which could lead to deadlocks.

This patch implements a sb_getblk_gfp with the only difference it can
accept user-provided GFP flags.
