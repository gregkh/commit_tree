perf tools: Add build option NO_AUXTRACE to exclude AUX area tracing

Add build option NO_AUXTRACE to exclude compiling support for AUX area
tracing. Support for both recording and processing is excluded and by
implication any future additions such as Intel PT and Intel BTS will
also not be compiled in with this option.
