drm/i915: suppress false PLL state warnings on non-GMCH platforms

The checks for PLL enabled state on CPU ports are valid only on GMCH
platforms but atm we'd also call them on non-PCH-split/non-GMCH
platforms like BXT, triggering false warnings. Until the proper check is
implented for these platforms simply disable the check.
