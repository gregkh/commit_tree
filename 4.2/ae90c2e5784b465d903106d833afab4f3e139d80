iwlwifi: mvm: fix the net-detect SSIDs report order

After the scan refactor, the order of the SSIDs passed to the firmware
in all scans (including net-detect) are inverted.  This was causing
the reporting code to use the wrong SSIDs.  To fix this, invert the
array index when accessing the saved match SSIDs to report the
wake-up.
