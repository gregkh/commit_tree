livepatch: make kobject in klp_object statically allocated

Make kobj variable (of type struct kobject) statically allocated in
klp_object structure. It will allow us to move in the func-object-patch
hierarchy through kobject links.

The only reason to have it dynamic was to not have empty release
callback in the code. However we have empty callbacks for function and
patch in the code now, so it is no longer valid and the advantage of
static allocation is clear.
