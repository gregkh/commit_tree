Input: gpio_keys_polled - request GPIO pin as input.

GPIOF_IN flag was lost in:
Commit 633a21d80b4a("input: gpio_keys_polled: Add support for GPIO
descriptors").

Without this flag, legacy code path (for non-descriptor GPIO declarations)
would configure GPIO as output (0 meaning GPIOF_DIR_OUT | GPIOF_INIT_LOW).
