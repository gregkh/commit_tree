ARM: use ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M for ARMv7-M platforms

Use the new config symbol ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M which groups config
symbols used by modern ARMv7-M platforms. This allows supporting
multiple ARMv7-M platforms in one kernel image. However, a common
kernel image requires the combined platforms to share the same
main memory layout to be bootable.
