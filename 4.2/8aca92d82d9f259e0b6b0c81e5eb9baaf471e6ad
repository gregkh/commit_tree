powerpc/iommu: Always release iommu_table in iommu_free_table()

At the moment iommu_free_table() only releases memory if
the table was initialized for the platform code use, i.e. it had
it_map initialized (which purpose is to track DMA memory space use).

With dynamic DMA windows, we will need to be able to release
iommu_table even if it was used for VFIO in which case it_map is NULL
so does the patch.
