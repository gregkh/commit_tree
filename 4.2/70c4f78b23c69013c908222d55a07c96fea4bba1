x86: replace __init_or_module with __init in non-modular vsmp_64.c

The __init_or_module is from commit 05e12e1c4c09cd35ac9f4e6af1e
("x86: fix 27-rc crash on vsmp due to paravirt during module load").

But as of commit 70511134f61bd6e5eed19f767381f9fb3e762d49
("Revert "x86: don't compile vsmp_64 for 32bit") this file became
obj-y and hence is now only for built-in.  That makes any
"_or_module" support no longer necessary.

We need to distinguish between the two in order to do some header
reorganization between init.h and module.h and we don't want to
be including module.h in non-modular code.
