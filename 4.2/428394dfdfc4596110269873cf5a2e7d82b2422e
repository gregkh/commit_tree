ACPICA: acpidump: Allow customized tables to be dumped without accessing /dev/mem

ACPICA commit ab29013cfa2424140446aff196a70b211ab343a9

The /dev/mem can be configured out, in which case, acpidump should still
work with "-c" option as tables can be found in /sys/firmware/acpi/tables.
This patch allows acpidump to work without /dev/mem.
This patch has been tested with "acpidump -c" and "acpidump -c -n FADT".
And it worked as expected. Lv Zheng.
