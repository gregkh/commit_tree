crypto: talitos - base address for Execution Units

SEC 1.0, 1.2 and 2.x+ have different EU base addresses, so we need to
define pointers for each EU in the driver private data structure.
The proper address is set by the probe function depending on the
SEC type, in order to provide access to the proper address.
