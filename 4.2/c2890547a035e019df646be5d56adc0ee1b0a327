iio: magnetometer: mmc35240: Fix broken processed value

The current computation for fractional part of the magnetic
field is broken. This patch fixes it by taking a different
approach. We expose the raw reading in milli Gauss (to avoid
rounding errors) with a scale of 0.001.

Thus the final computation is done in userspace where floating
point operation are more relaxed.
