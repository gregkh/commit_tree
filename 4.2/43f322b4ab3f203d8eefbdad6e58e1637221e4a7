perf tests: Switch from open to openat

Multiple perf tests fail on arm64 due to missing open syscall:

 2: detect open syscall event                              : FAILED!

open(2) is a legacy syscall, replaced with openat(2) since 2.6.16.  Thus
new architectures in kernel, such as arm64, don't implement these legacy
syscalls.

The patch replaces all sys_enter_open events with sys_enter_openat,
renames the related tests and test output to avoid confusion.
