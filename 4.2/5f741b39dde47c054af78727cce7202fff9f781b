drm: omapdrm: new vblank and event handling

Rework the crtc event/flip_wait system as follows:

- If we enable a crtc (full modeset), we set omap_crtc->pending and
  register vblank irq.

- If we need to set GO bit (page flip), we do the same but also set the
  GO bit.

- On vblank we unregister the irq, clear the 'pending' flag, send vblank
  event to userspace if crtc->state->event != NULL, and wake up
  'pending_wait' wq.

- In omap_atomic_complete() we wait for the 'pending' flag to get reset
  for all enabled crtcs  using 'pending_wait' wq.

The above ensures that we send the events to userspace in vblank, and
that after the wait in omap_atomic_complete() everything for the
affected crtcs has been completed.
