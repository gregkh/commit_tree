    drm/i915: Use atomic helpers for computing changed flags

we've switched over to the atomic version to compute the
crtc->encoder->connector routing from the i915 variant. That one
relies upon the ->best_encoder callback, but the i915-private version
relied upon intel_find_encoder. Which didn't matter except for dp mst,
where the encoder depends upon the selected crtc.

Fix this functional bug by implemented a correct atomic-state based
encoder selector for dp mst.

Note that we can't get rid of the legacy best_encoder callback since
the fbdev emulation uses that still. That means it's incorrect there
still, but that's been the case ever since i915 dp mst support was
merged so not a regression. Best to fix that by converting fbdev over
to atomic too.
