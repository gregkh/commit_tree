ACPI / EC: Fix a code coverity issue when QR_EC transactions are failed.

When the QR_EC transaction fails, the EC_FLAGS_QUERY_PENDING flag prevents
the event handling work queue from being scheduled again.

Though there shouldn't be failed QR_EC transactions, and this gap was
efficiently used for catching and learning the SCI_EVT clearing timing
compliance issues, we need to fix this as we are not fully compatible
with all platforms/Windows to handle SCI_EVT clearing timing correctly.
Fixing this gives the EC driver the chances to recover from a state machine
failure.

So this patch fixes this issue. When nr_pending_queries drops to 0, it
clears EC_FLAGS_QUERY_PENDING at the proper position for different modes in
order to ensure that the SCI_EVT handling can proceed.

In order to be clearer for future ec_event_clearing modes, all checks in
this patch are written in the inclusive style, not the exclusive style.
