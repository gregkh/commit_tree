hwmon: Rename i8k driver to dell-smm-hwmon and move it to hwmon tree

This commit moves i8k driver to hwmon tree under name dell-smm-hwmon which is
better name then abbreviation i8k. For backward compatibility is added macro
MODULE_ALIAS("i8k") so modprobe will load driver also old name i8k. CONFIG_I8K
compile option was not changed.

This commit also adds me as maintainer of this new dell-smm-hwmon driver and
remove Guenter Roeck from list who is implicit maintainer all hwmon drivers.
