staging: wilc1000: Disable for S390

The wilc1000 driver uses definitions such as DEBUG_LEVEL, DEBUG,
and PRINT_INFO. This causes compile errors on S390 which has similar
definitions in its core code. Disable the driver for S390 instead
of giving the non-standard messaging code credit by trying to fix it.
