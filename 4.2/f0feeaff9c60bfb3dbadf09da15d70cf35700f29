staging: wilc1000: remove unwanted code

This patch removes SIOCDEVPRIVATE + 1 ioctl.  It currently is just a
stub which does some useless printks and returns.  In the original code,
if the user passes priv_cmd.total_len == 0 then it will Oops.  Also it
leaks memory every time it's called.  In the future, we will implement
this functionality using generic API functions
