staging: unisys: move timskmod.h functionality

This patch removes all timksmod.h pound defines. It also removes
visorkmodutils.c since it no longer has any use by itself. Since
visorkmodutils.c is no longer needed the module_init for
visorchipset.c is modified to call visorutil_spar_detect directly
instead of the extern variable in timksmod.h.
