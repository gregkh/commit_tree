ASoC: rsnd: don't call snd_pcm_period_elapsed() under spin lock

'a9e1ac1a9e4585b5("ASoC: rsnd: spin lock for interrupt handler")'
added spin lock under interrupt handler to solve HW restart issue.

OTOH, current rsnd driver calls snd_pcm_period_elapsed() from
rsnd_dai_pointer_update(). but, it will be called under spin lock
if SSI was PIO mode.

If it was called under spin lock, it will call
snd_pcm_update_state() -> snd_pcm_drain_done().
Then, it calls rsnd_soc_dai_trigger() and will be dead-lock.
This patch doesn't call rsnd_dai_pointer_update() under spin lock
