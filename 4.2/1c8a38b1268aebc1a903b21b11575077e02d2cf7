dmaengine: at_xdmac: fix transfer data width in at_xdmac_prep_slave_sg()

This patch adds the missing update of the transfer data width in
at_xdmac_prep_slave_sg().

Indeed, for each item in the scatter-gather list, we check whether the
transfer length is aligned with the data width provided by
dmaengine_slave_config(). If so, we directly use this data width for the
current part of the transfer we are preparing. Otherwise, the data width
is reduced to 8 bits (1 byte). Of course, the actual number of register
accesses must also be updated to match the new data width.

So one chunk was missing in the original patch (see Fixes tag below): the
number of register accesses was correctly set to (len >> fixed_dwidth) in
mbr_ubc but the real data width was not updated in mbr_cfg. Since mbr_cfg
may change for each part of the scatter-gather transfer this also explains
why the original patch used the Descriptor View 2 instead of the
Descriptor View 1.

Let's take the example of a DMA transfer to write 8bit data into an Atmel
USART with FIFOs. When FIFOs are enabled in the USART, its Transmit
Holding Register (THR) works in multidata mode, that is to say that up to
4 8bit data can be written into the THR in a single 32bit access and it is
still possible to write only one data with a 8bit access. To take
advantage of this new feature, the DMA driver was modified to allow
multiple dwidths when doing slave transfers.
For instance, when the total length is 22 bytes, the USART driver splits
the transfer into 2 parts:

First part: 20 bytes transferred through 5 32bit writes into THR
Second part: 2 bytes transferred though 2 8bit writes into THR

For the second part, the data width was first set to 4_BYTES by the USART
driver thanks to dmaengine_slave_config() then at_xdmac_prep_slave_sg()
reduces this data width to 1_BYTE because the 2 byte length is not aligned
with the original 4_BYTES data width. Since the data width is modified,
the actual number of writes into THR must be set accordingly.
