bridge: netlink: fix slave_changelink/br_setport race conditions

Since slave_changelink support was added there have been a few race
conditions when using br_setport() since some of the port functions it
uses require the bridge lock. It is very easy to trigger a lockup due to
some internal spin_lock() usage without bh disabled, also it's possible to
get the bridge into an inconsistent state.
