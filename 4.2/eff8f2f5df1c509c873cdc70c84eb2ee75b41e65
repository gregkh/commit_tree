mmc: dw_mmc: Use core to handle absent write protect line

Use the new MMC_CAP2_NO_WRITE_PROTECT to let the core handle the case where
no write protect line is present instead of having custom driver code to
handle it.

dw_mci_of_get_slot_quirks() is slightly refactored to directly modify the
mmc_host capabilities instead of returning a quirk mask.
