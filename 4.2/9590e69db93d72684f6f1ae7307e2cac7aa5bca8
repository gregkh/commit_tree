drm/msm: use devm_gpiod_get_optional for optional reset gpio

Since 39b2bbe3d715 (gpio: add flags argument to gpiod_get*() functions)
which appeared in v3.17-rc1, the gpiod_get* functions take an additional
parameter that allows to specify direction and initial value for output.

Also there is a variant to find optional gpios that returns NULL if
there is no gpio instead of -ENOENT.

Make use of both features to simplify the driver.

This makes error checking more strict because errors like -ENOSYS ("no
gpio support compiled in") or -EPROBE_DEFER ("gpio not ready yet") are
handled correctly now.

Furthermore this is one caller less that stops us making the flags
argument to gpiod_get*() mandatory.
