perf tools: Move TUI-specific fields out of map_symbol

The has_children and unfolded fields don't belong to the struct
map_symbol since they're used by the TUI only.  Move those fields out of
map_symbol since the struct is also used by other places.

This will also help to compact the sizeof struct hist_entry.
