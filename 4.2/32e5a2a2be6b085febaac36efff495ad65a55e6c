ocfs2: fix shift left overflow

When using a large volume, for example 9T volume with 2T already used,
frequent creation of small files with O_DIRECT when the IO is not
cluster aligned may clear sectors in the wrong place.  This will cause
filesystem corruption.

This is because p_cpos is a u32.  When calculating the corresponding
sector it should be converted to u64 first, otherwise it may overflow.
