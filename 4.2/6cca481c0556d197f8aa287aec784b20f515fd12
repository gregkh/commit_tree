drm: omapdrm: Remove omap_crtc enabled field

The field tracks the CRTC state to avoid double-enable or -disable. As
the DRM atomic core guarantees that the CRTC enable and disable
functions won't be called on an already enabled or disabled CRTC, such
tracking isn't needed. Remove the enabled field.
