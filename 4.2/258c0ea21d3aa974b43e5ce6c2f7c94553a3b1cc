fbdev: ssd1307fb: fix memory address smem_start.

the smem_start pointer of the framebuffer info struct needs to hold the
physical address rather than the logical address. Right now the logical
address returned by kmalloc is stored. This patch converts this address
to a physical address and thus fixes a driver crash on mmaping the
framebuffer memory due to an access to the wrong memory address.
