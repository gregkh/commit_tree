writeback: move over_bground_thresh() to mm/page-writeback.c

and rename it to wb_over_bg_thresh().  The function is closely tied to
the dirty throttling mechanism implemented in page-writeback.c.  This
relocation will allow future updates necessary for cgroup writeback
support.

While at it, add function comment.

This is pure reorganization and doesn't introduce any behavioral
changes.
