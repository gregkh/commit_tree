crypto: drivers - Fix Kconfig selects

This patch fixes a number of problems in crypto driver Kconfig
entries:

1. Select BLKCIPHER instead of BLKCIPHER2.  The latter is internal
and should not be used outside of the crypto API itself.
2. Do not select ALGAPI unless you use a legacy type like
CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_CIPHER.
3. Select the algorithm type that you are implementing, e.g., AEAD.
4. Do not select generic C code such as CBC/ECB unless you use them
as a fallback.
5. Remove default n since that is the default default.
