ath10k: handle cycle counter wraparound

When QCA988X cycle counter HW register wraps
around it resets to 0x7fffffff instead of 0. All
other cycle counter related registers are divided
by 2 so they never wraparound themselves. QCA61X4
has a uniform CC and it wraparounds in a regular
fashion though.

Worst case wraparound time is approx 24 seconds
(2**31 / 88MHz). Since scan channel visit times
are max 5 seconds (offchannel case) it is
guaranteed there's been at most 1 wraparound and
it is possible to compute survey active time
value. It is, however, impossible to determine the
point at which Rx Clear Count has been divided by
two so it is not reported upon wraparound.

This fixes some occasional incorrect survey data
on QCA988X as some channels (depending on how/when
scan/offchannel requests were requested) would
have approx 24 sec active time which wasn't
actually the case.

This should improve hostapd ACS a little bit.
