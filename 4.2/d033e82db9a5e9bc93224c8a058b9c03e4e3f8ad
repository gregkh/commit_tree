tty/serial: at91: handle IRQ status more safely

Handle the changed flag of IRQ status in interruption
instead of handling it in tasklet due to the tasklet
may be scheduled more than once in one interruption.
Otherwise, the changed status may be processed more
than once which will lead to unexpected result. And
seriously, kernel will crash.
