MIPS: Fix seccomp syscall argument for MIPS64

Commit 4c21b8fd8f14 ("MIPS: seccomp: Handle indirect system calls (o32)")
fixed indirect system calls on O32 but it also introduced a bug for MIPS64
where it erroneously modified the v0 (syscall) register with the assumption
that the sycall offset hasn't been taken into consideration. This breaks
seccomp on MIPS64 n64 and n32 ABIs. We fix this by replacing the addition
with a move instruction.
