ACPICA: Hardware: Fix a resource leak issue in acpi_hw_build_pci_list().

ACPICA commit e4f0b73c107680841d7dd01cc04ec108df6580bd

There is code in acpi_hw_build_pci_list() destructing returned object
(return_list_head) before touching it while the allocated new object
(list_head) is not tracked correctly to be destructed on the error case,
which is detected as unsecure code by the "Coverity" tool.

This patch fixes this issue by always intializing the returned object in
acpi_hw_build_pci_list() so that the caller of acpi_hw_build_pci_list() needn't
initialize it and always using the returned object to track the new
allocated objects. Lv Zheng.
