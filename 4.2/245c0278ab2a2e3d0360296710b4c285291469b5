serial: tegra: Correct delay after TX flush

For all tegra devices (up to t210), there is a hardware issue that
requires software to wait for 32 UART clock periods for the flush
to propagate otherwise TX data could be post. Add a helper function
to wait for N UART clock periods and update delay following FIFO
flush to be 32 UART clock cycles.
