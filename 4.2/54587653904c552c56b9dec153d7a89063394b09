x86/mpx: Introduce new 'directory entry' to 'addr' helper function

Currently, to get from a bounds directory entry to the virtual
address of a bounds table, we simply mask off a few low bits.
However, the set of bits we mask off is different for 32-bit and
64-bit binaries.

This breaks the operation out in to a helper function and also
adds a temporary variable to store the result until we are
sure we are returning one.
