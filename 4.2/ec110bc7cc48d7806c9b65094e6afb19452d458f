NTB: Move files in preparation for NTB abstraction

This patch only moves files to their new locations, before applying the
next two patches adding the NTB Abstraction layer.  Splitting this patch
from the next is intended make distinct which code is changed only due
to moving the files, versus which are substantial code changes in adding
the NTB Abstraction layer.
