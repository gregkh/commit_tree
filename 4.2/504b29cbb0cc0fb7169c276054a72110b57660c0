[media] saa7164: Add Digital TV support for the HVR2255 and HVR2205

Adding support for the Hauppauge HVR2255 and Hauppauge HVR2205
PCIe cards. Digital TV for DVB-T and ATSC/US-Cable is known to
work. Support for analog RF tuners does not work due to
a lack of analog support in the upstream SI2157 driver.
