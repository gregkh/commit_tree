rcu: Eliminate a few RCU_BOOST #ifdefs in favor of IS_ENABLED()

This commit removes a few RCU_BOOST #ifdefs, replacing them with
IS_ENABLED()-protected return statements.  This relies on the
optimizer to remove any resulting dead code.  There are several other
RCU_BOOST #ifdefs, however these rely on some per-CPU variables that
are available only under RCU_BOOST.  These might be converted later,
if the simplification proves to outweigh the increase in memory footprint.
One hoped-for advantage is more easily locating compiler errors in
obscure combinations of Kconfig parameters.
