HID: i2c-hid: fix harmless test_bit() issue

These defines are used like this:

	if (test_bit(I2C_HID_STARTED, &ihid->flags))

The intent was to use bits 0, 1, and 2 but because of the extra shifts
we're using bits 1, 2, and 4.  It's harmless becuase it's done
consistently but it's not the intent and static checkers will complain.
