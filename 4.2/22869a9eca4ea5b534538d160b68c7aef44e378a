MFD/OF: document MFD devices and handle simple-mfd

This defines a new compatible option for MFD devices "simple-mfd" that will
make the OF core spawn child devices for all subnodes of that MFD device.
It is optional but handy for things like syscon and possibly other
simpler MFD devices.

Since there was no file to put the documentation in, I took this opportunity
to make a small writeup on MFD devices and add the compatible definition
there.
