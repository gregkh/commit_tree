libfc: Fix fc_exch_recv_req() error path

Due to patch "libfc: Do not invoke the response handler after
fc_exch_done()" (commit ID 7030fd62) the lport_recv() call
in fc_exch_recv_req() is passed a dangling pointer. Avoid this
by moving the fc_frame_free() call from fc_invoke_resp() to its
callers. This patch fixes the following crash:

general protection fault: 0000 [#3] PREEMPT SMP
RIP: fc_lport_recv_req+0x72/0x280 [libfc]
