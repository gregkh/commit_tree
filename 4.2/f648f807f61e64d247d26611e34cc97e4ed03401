sctp: donot reset the overall_error_count in SHUTDOWN_RECEIVE state

Commit f8d960524328 ("sctp: Enforce retransmission limit during shutdown")
fixed a problem with excessive retransmissions in the SHUTDOWN_PENDING by not
resetting the association overall_error_count.  This allowed the association
to better enforce assoc.max_retrans limit.

However, the same issue still exists when the association is in SHUTDOWN_RECEIVED
state.  In this state, HB-ACKs will continue to reset the overall_error_count
for the association would extend the lifetime of association unnecessarily.

This patch solves this by resetting the overall_error_count whenever the current
state is small then SCTP_STATE_SHUTDOWN_PENDING.  As a small side-effect, we
end up also handling SCTP_STATE_SHUTDOWN_ACK_SENT and SCTP_STATE_SHUTDOWN_SENT
states, but they are not really impacted because we disable Heartbeats in those
states.
