arm/arm64: kvm: add missing PSCI include

We make use of the PSCI function IDs, but don't explicitly include the
header which defines them. Relying on transitive header includes is
fragile and will be broken as headers are refactored.

This patch includes the relevant header file directly so as to avoid
future breakage.
