genirq: Prevent resend to interrupts marked IRQ_NESTED_THREAD

The resend mechanism happily calls the interrupt handler of interrupts
which are marked IRQ_NESTED_THREAD from softirq context. This can
result in crashes because the interrupt handler is not the proper way
to invoke the device handlers. They must be invoked via
handle_nested_irq.

Prevent the resend even if the interrupt has no valid parent irq
set. Its better to have a lost interrupt than a crashing machine.
