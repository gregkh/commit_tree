powerpc/fsl: Add FMan Port 10G compatibles

This patch adds two boolean properties to FMan Port.
FMan has 3 types of ports:
	- 1G ports
		By default, all ports support 1G rate
	- 10G Ports
		Port which use 10G hardware, and configured as 10G
	- 10G Best effort ports
		Ports which use 1G hardware, configured as 10G, in this case,
		the rate is not guaranteed.
The new properties help to distinguish the different type of ports.
