mmc: Add support for disabling write-protect detection

It is not uncommon to see systems where there is no physical write-protect
signal (e.g. when using eMMC or microSD card slots). For some controllers,
which have a dedicated write-protection detection logic (like SDHCI
controllers), the get_ro() callback can return bogus data in such a case.

Instead of handling this on a per controller basis this patch adds a new
capability flag to the MMC core that can be set to specify that the result
of get_ro() is invalid. When the flag is set the core will not call
get_ro() and assume that the card is always read-write.
