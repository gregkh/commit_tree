mm: clarify that the function operates on hugepage pte

We have confusing functions to clear pmd, pmd_clear_* and pmd_clear.  Add
_huge_ to pmdp_clear functions so that we are clear that they operate on
hugepage pte.

We don't bother about other functions like pmdp_set_wrprotect,
pmdp_clear_flush_young, because they operate on PTE bits and hence
indicate they are operating on hugepage ptes
