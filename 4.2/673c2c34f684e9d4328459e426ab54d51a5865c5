modpost: work correctly with tile coldtext sections

The tilegx and tilepro compilers use .coldtext for their unlikely
executed text section name, so an __attribute__((cold)) function
will (when compiled with higher optimization levels) land in
the .coldtext section.

Modify modpost to add .coldtext to the set of OTHER_TEXT_SECTIONS
so we don't get warnings about referencing such a section in an
__ex_table block, and then also modify arch/tile/lib/memcpy_user_64.c
so that it uses plain ".coldtext" instead of ".coldtext.memcpy".
The latter naming is a relic of an earlier use of -ffunction-sections,
which we no longer use by default.
