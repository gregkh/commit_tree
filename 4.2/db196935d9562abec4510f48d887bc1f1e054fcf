fnic: Use the local variable instead of I/O flag to acquire io_req_lock in fnic_queuecommand() to avoid deadloack

We added changes in fnic driver patch 1.6.0.16 to acquire
io_req_lock in fnic_queuecommand() before issuing I/O so that io completion
is serialized. But when releasing the lock we check for the I/O flag and
this could be modified if IO abort occurs before I/O completion. In this case
we wont release the lock and causes deadlock in some scenerios. Using the
local variable to check the IO lock status will resolve the problem.
