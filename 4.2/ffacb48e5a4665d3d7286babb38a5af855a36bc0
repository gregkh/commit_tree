ASoC: dapm: Fix deadlock on auto-disable mux controls

The commit 02aa78abec6e ("ASoC: DAPM: Add APIs to create individual DAPM
controls.") added locking to the snd_soc_dapm_new_control function but
did not update the call to snd_soc_dapm_new_control in the auto-disable
mux code, this appears to be because the patches were sent at fairly
similar times.

This patch change the call in the auto-disable mux code to use the new
snd_soc_dapm_new_control_unlocked function instead.
