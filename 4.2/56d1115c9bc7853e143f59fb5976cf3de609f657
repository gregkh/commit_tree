xfs: allocate sparse inode chunks on full chunk allocation failure

xfs_ialloc_ag_alloc() makes several attempts to allocate a full inode
chunk. If all else fails, reduce the allocation to the sparse length and
alignment and attempt to allocate a sparse inode chunk.

If sparse chunk allocation succeeds, check whether an inobt record
already exists that can track the chunk. If so, inherit and update the
existing record. Otherwise, insert a new record for the sparse chunk.

Create helpers to align sparse chunk inode records and insert or update
existing records in the inode btrees. The xfs_inobt_insert_sprec()
helper implements the merge or update semantics required for sparse
inode records with respect to both the inobt and finobt. To update the
inobt, either insert a new record or merge with an existing record. To
update the finobt, use the updated inobt record to either insert or
replace an existing record.
