KVM: SVM: use NPT page attributes

Right now, NPT page attributes are not used, and the final page
attribute depends solely on gPAT (which however is not synced
correctly), the guest MTRRs and the guest page attributes.

However, we can do better by mimicking what is done for VMX.
In the absence of PCI passthrough, the guest PAT can be ignored
and the page attributes can be just WB.  If passthrough is being
used, instead, keep respecting the guest PAT, and emulate the guest
MTRRs through the PAT field of the nested page tables.

The only snag is that WP memory cannot be emulated correctly,
because Linux's default PAT setting only includes the other types.
