net/mlx5_core: HW data structs/types definitions cleanup

mlx5_ifc.h was heavily modified here since it is now generated by a
script from the device specification (PRM rev 0.25). This specification
is backward compatible to existing hardware.

Some structures/fields were added here in order to enable the Ethernet
functionality of the driver.
