ACPI / EC: Remove storming threashold enlarging quirk.

This patch removes the storming threashold enlarging quirk.

After applying the following commit, we can notice that there is no no-op
GPE handling invocation can be observed, thus it is unlikely that the
no-op counts can exceed the storming threashold:
  Commit: ca37bfdfbc8d0a3ec73e4b97bb26dcfa51d515aa
  Subject: ACPI / EC: Fix several GPE handling issues by deploying ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_RAW_HANDLER mode.
Even when the storming happens, we have already limited its affection to
the only transaction and no further transactions will be affected. This is
done by this commit:
  Commit: e1d4d90fc0313d3d58cbd7912c90f8ef24df45ff
  Subject: ACPI / EC: Refine command storm prevention support

So it's time to remove this quirk.
