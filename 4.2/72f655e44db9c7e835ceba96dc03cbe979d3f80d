ieee802154: introduce wpan_phy_supported

This patch introduce the wpan_phy_supported struct for wpan_phy. There
is currently no way to check if a transceiver can handle IEEE 802.15.4
complaint values. With this struct we can check before if the
transceiver supports these values before sending to driver layer.
