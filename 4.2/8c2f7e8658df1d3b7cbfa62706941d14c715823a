libnvdimm: infrastructure for btt devices

NVDIMM namespaces, in addition to accepting "struct bio" based requests,
also have the capability to perform byte-aligned accesses.  By default
only the bio/block interface is used.  However, if another driver can
make effective use of the byte-aligned capability it can claim namespace
interface and use the byte-aligned ->rw_bytes() interface.

The BTT driver is the initial first consumer of this mechanism to allow
adding atomic sector update semantics to a pmem or blk namespace.  This
patch is the sysfs infrastructure to allow configuring a BTT instance
for a namespace.  Enabling that BTT and performing i/o is in a
subsequent patch.
