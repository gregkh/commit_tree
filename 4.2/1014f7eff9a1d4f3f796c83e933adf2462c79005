ASoC: tas2552: Correct the PLL configuration

Do not restrict the sampling rate to 44.1/48KHz. The pll_clk clock should
be (sampling rate * 512) in all cases.
Correct the J.D calculation (the D part was incorrectly calculated).
Restore PLL enable status after we are done with the configuration.
Implement hardware constraint handling towards the pll_clkin:
if D != 0 (in J.D) then 1.1MHz <= pll_clkin <= 9.2MHz needs to be checked.
If the PLL setup does not met with this constraint, fall back to BCLK as
reference clock, if BCLK fails, use the internal 1.8MHz clock.
