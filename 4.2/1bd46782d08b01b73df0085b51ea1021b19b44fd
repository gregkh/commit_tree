ARM: avoid unwanted GCC memset()/memcpy() optimisations for IO variants

We don't want GCC optimising our memset_io(), memcpy_fromio() or
memcpy_toio() variants, so we must not call one of the standard
functions.  Provide a separate name for our assembly memcpy() and
memset() functions, and use that instead, thereby bypassing GCC's
ability to optimise these operations.

GCCs optimisation may introduce unaligned accesses which are invalid
for device mappings.
