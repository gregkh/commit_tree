kselftests: timers: Ease alarmtimer-suspend unreasonable latency value

On the hardware I have, resume latency from an alarm is often
2-3 seconds (with a fair amount of variability due to the RTC's
single second granularity). Having four seconds be the pass/fail
bar is maybe a little too tight, so extend this to 5 seconds.
