cpufreq: arm_big_little: remove compile-time dependency on BIG_LITTLE

With the addition of switcher code, there's compile-time dependency on
BIG_LITTLE to get arm_big_little driver compiling on ARM64. Since ARM64
will never add support for bL switcher, it's better to remove the
dependency so that the driver can be reused on ARM64 platforms.

This patch adds stubs to remove BIG_LITTLE dependency in the driver.
