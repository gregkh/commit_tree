ASoC: wm5110: Replace direct snd_soc_codec dapm field access

The dapm field of the snd_soc_codec struct is eventually going to be
removed, in preparation for this replace all manual access to codec->dapm
with snd_soc_codec_get_dapm().

While we are at it also remove the duplicated initialization of
priv->core.arizona->dapm.
