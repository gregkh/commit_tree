cxl: Implement an ioctl to fetch afu card-id, offset-id and mode

Given a file descriptor on an afu device, libcxl currently uses the
major/minor number obtained from fstat on the fd to construct path to
the afu's sysfs directory. However it is possible that rather than using
one of the device in /dev/cxl, a kernel driver creates its own device
which export generic cxl interface to the userspace. This causes
problems with libcxl as it tries to use a wrong major/minor number to
construct the sysfs path and fail.

So this patch introduces a new ioctl called CXL_IOCTL_GET_AFU_ID on the
afu file descriptor to fetch the cxl_afu_id struct that holds the
card/offset-id and mode information. These info is then used by libcxl to
construct the correct path to the afu sysfs directory.

Testing:
	- Build against pseries be/le configs
	- Testing with corresponding libcxl changes to verify that it constructs
	  right sysfs path to the afu.
