arm/mach-rockchip: remove legacy __cpuinit section that crept in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time ago.
However this one crept back in as of commit a7a2b3118b410fb3cd3a8363b1
("ARM: rockchip: add smp bringup code").

Since we want to clobber the stubs soon, get this removed now.
