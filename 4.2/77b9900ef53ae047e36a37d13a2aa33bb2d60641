tc: introduce Flower classifier

This patch introduces a flow-based filter. So far, the very essential
packet fields are supported.

This patch is only the first step. There is a lot of potential performance
improvements possible to implement. Also a lot of features are missing
now. They will be addressed in follow-up patches.
