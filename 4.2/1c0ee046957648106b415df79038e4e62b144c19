can: pcan_usb: don't touch skb after netif_rx()

There is no guarantee that the skb is in the same state after calling
net_receive_skb() or netif_rx(). It might be freed or reused. Not really
harmful as its a read access, except you turn on the proper debugging options
which catch a use after free.
