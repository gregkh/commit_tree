packet: missing dev_put() in packet_do_bind()

When binding a PF_PACKET socket, the use count of the bound interface is
always increased with dev_hold in dev_get_by_{index,name}.  However,
when rebound with the same protocol and device as in the previous bind
the use count of the interface was not decreased.  Ultimately, this
caused the deletion of the interface to fail with the following message:

unregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy0 to become free. Usage count = 1

This patch moves the dev_put out of the conditional part that was only
executed when either the protocol or device changed on a bind.
