net: fec: use reinit_completion() in mdio accessor functions

Rather than re-initialising the entire completion on every mdio access,
use reinit_completion() which only resets the completion count.  This
avoids possible reinitialisation of the contained spinlock and waitqueue
while they may be in use (eg, mid-completion.)

Such an event could occur if there's a long delay in interrupt handling
causing the mdio accessor to time out, then a second access comes in
while the interrupt handler on a different CPU has called complete().
Another scenario where this has been observed is while locking has
been missing at the phy layer, allowing concurrent attempts to access
the MDIO bus.
