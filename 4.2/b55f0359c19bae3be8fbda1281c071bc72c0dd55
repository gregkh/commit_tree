misc: mic: SCIF Peer Bus

The SCIF peer bus is used to register and unregister SCIF peer devices
internally by the SCIF driver to signify the addition and removal of
peer nodes respectively from the SCIF network. This simplifies remote node
handling within SCIF and will also be used to support device probe/remove
for SCIF client drivers (e.g. netdev over SCIF)
