ima: wrap event related data to the new ima_event_data structure

All event related data has been wrapped into the new 'ima_event_data'
structure. The main benefit of this patch is that a new information
can be made available to template fields initialization functions
by simply adding a new field to the new structure instead of modifying
the definition of those functions.

Changelog:
 - v2:
   - f_dentry replaced with f_path.dentry (Roberto Sassu)
   - removed declaration of temporary variables in template field functions
     when possible (suggested by Dmitry Kasatkin)
