writeback: remove bdi_start_writeback()

bdi_start_writeback() is a thin wrapper on top of
__wb_start_writeback() which is used only by laptop_mode_timer_fn().
This patches removes bdi_start_writeback(), renames
__wb_start_writeback() to wb_start_writeback() and makes
laptop_mode_timer_fn() use it instead.

This doesn't cause any functional difference and will ease making
laptop_mode_timer_fn() cgroup writeback aware.
