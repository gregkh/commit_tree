ipv6: Make MLD packets to only be processed locally

Before commit daad151263cf ("ipv6: Make ipv6_is_mld() inline and use it
from ip6_mc_input().") MLD packets were only processed locally. After the
change, a copy of MLD packet goes through ip6_mr_input, causing
MRT6MSG_NOCACHE message to be generated to user space.

Make MLD packet only processed locally.
