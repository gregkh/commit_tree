xfs: pass inode count through ordered icreate log item

v5 superblocks use an ordered log item for logging the initialization of
inode chunks. The icreate log item is currently hardcoded to an inode
count of 64 inodes.

The agbno and extent length are used to initialize the inode chunk from
log recovery. While an incorrect inode count does not lead to bad inode
chunk initialization, we should pass the correct inode count such that log
recovery has enough data to perform meaningful validity checks on the
chunk.
