i2c: davinci: Refactor i2c_davinci_wait_bus_not_busy()

There are several problems in the function:
- "to_cnt" variable does nothing
- schedule_timeout() call without setting current state does nothing
- "allow_sleep" parameter is not really used

Refactor the function so that it really tries to wait. In case of timeout try
to recover the bus.
