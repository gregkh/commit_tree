tipc: simplify packet sequence number handling

Although the sequence number in the TIPC protocol is 16 bits, we have
until now stored it internally as an unsigned 32 bits integer.
We got around this by always doing explicit modulo-65535 operations
whenever we need to access a sequence number.

We now make the incoming and outgoing sequence numbers to unsigned
16-bit integers, and remove the modulo operations where applicable.

We also move the arithmetic inline functions for 16 bit integers
to core.h, and the function buf_seqno() to msg.h, so they can easily
be accessed from anywhere in the code.
