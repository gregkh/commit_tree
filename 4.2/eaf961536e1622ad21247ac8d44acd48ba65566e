libnvdimm, nfit: add interleave-set state-tracking infrastructure

On platforms that have firmware support for reading/writing per-dimm
label space, a portion of the dimm may be accessible via an interleave
set PMEM mapping in addition to the dimm's BLK (block-data-window
aperture(s)) interface.  A label, stored in a "configuration data
region" on the dimm, disambiguates which dimm addresses are accessed
through which exclusive interface.

Add infrastructure that allows the kernel to block modifications to a
label in the set while any member dimm is active.  Note that this is
meant only for enforcing "no modifications of active labels" via the
coarse ioctl command.  Adding/deleting namespaces from an active
interleave set is always possible via sysfs.

Another aspect of tracking interleave sets is tracking their integrity
when DIMMs in a set are physically re-ordered.  For this purpose we
generate an "interleave-set cookie" that can be recorded in a label and
validated against the current configuration.  It is the bus provider
implementation's responsibility to calculate the interleave set cookie
and attach it to a given region.
