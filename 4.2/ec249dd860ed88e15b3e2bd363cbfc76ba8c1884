cxl: Move include file cxl.h -> cxl-base.h

This moves the current include file from cxl.h -> cxl-base.h.  This current
include file is used only to pass information between the base driver that
needs to be built into the kernel and the cxl module.

This is to make way for a new include/misc/cxl.h which will
contain just the kernel API for other driver to use
