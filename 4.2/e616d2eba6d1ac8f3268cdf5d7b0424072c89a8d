ASoC: jack - add_gpiods accepts filled descriptors

Allow for the desc field to be pre-filled when adding gpios to a jack.
This allows drivers to get the gpios and decide if they should be added
to the list or not.  Specifically this will allow the gpio jack driver
to add gpios based on device property specifications.
