netconsole: remove unnecessary netconsole_target_get/out() from write_msg()

write_msg() grabs target_list_lock and walks target_list invoking
netpool_send_udp() on each target.  Curiously, it protects each iteration
with netconsole_target_get/put() even though it never releases
target_list_lock which protects all the members.

While this doesn't harm anything, it doesn't serve any purpose either.
The items on the list can't go away while target_list_lock is held.
Remove the unnecessary get/put pair.
