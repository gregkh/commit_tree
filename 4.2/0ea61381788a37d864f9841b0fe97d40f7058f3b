ACPICA commit 4da56eeae0749dfe8491285c1e1fad48f6efafd8

The following commit temporarily disables correct 64-bit FADT addresses
favor during the period the root cause of the bug is not fixed:
 Commit: 85dbd5801f62b66e2aa7826aaefcaebead44c8a6
 ACPICA: Tables: Restore old behavor to favor 32-bit FADT addresses.

With enough protections, this patch re-enables 64-bit FADT addresses by
default. If regressions are reported against such change, this patch should
be bisected and reverted.
Note that 64-bit FACS favor and 64-bit firmware waking vector favor are
excluded by this commit in order not to break OSPMs. Lv Zheng.
