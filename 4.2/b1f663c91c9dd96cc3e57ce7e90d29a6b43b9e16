Bluetooth: Add debugfs support for min LE encryption key size

This patch adds a debugfs control to set a different minimum LE
encryption key size. This is useful for testing that implementation of
the encryption key size handling is behaving correctly (e.g. that we
get appropriate 'Encryption Key Size' error responses when necessary).
