mm/memory-failure: split thp earlier in memory error handling

memory_failure() doesn't handle thp itself at this time and need to split
it before doing isolation.  Currently thp is split in the middle of
hwpoison_user_mappings(), but there're corner cases where memory_failure()
wrongly tries to handle thp without splitting.

1) "non anonymous" thp, which is not a normal operating mode of thp,
   but a memory error could hit a thp before anon_vma is initialized.  In
   such case, split_huge_page() fails and me_huge_page() (intended for
   hugetlb) is called for thp, which triggers BUG_ON in page_hstate().

2) !PageLRU case, where hwpoison_user_mappings() returns with
   SWAP_SUCCESS and the result is the same as case 1.

memory_failure() can't avoid splitting, so let's split it more earlier,
which also reduces code which are prepared for both of normal page and
thp.
