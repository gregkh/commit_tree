staging: unisys: Move channel creation up the stack

Instead of creating a channel struct to temporarily hold the channel
info and passing it through multiple functions until the device is
created, just create the channel from the start.

This allows us to remove the channel_info struct.

I noticed 'chan_info.addr_type' was not being used, so I just deleted it.
