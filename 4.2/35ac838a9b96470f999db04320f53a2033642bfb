sock_diag: implement a get_info handler for inet

This get_info handler will simply dispatch to the appropriate
existing inet protocol handler.

This patch also includes a new netlink attribute
(INET_DIAG_PROTOCOL).  This attribute is currently only used
for multicast messages.  Without this attribute, there is no
way of knowing the IP protocol used by the socket information
being broadcast.  This attribute is not necessary in the 'dump'
variant of this protocol (though it could easily be added)
because dump requests are issued for specific family/protocol
pairs.

Tested: ss -E (note, the -E option has not yet been merged into
the upstream version of ss).
