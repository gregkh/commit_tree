writeback: reset wb_domain->dirty_limit[_tstmp] when memcg domain size changes

The amount of available memory to a memcg wb_domain can change as
memcg configuration changes.  A domain's ->dirty_limit exists to
smooth out sudden drops in dirty threshold; however, when a domain's
size actually drops significantly, it hinders the dirty throttling
from adjusting to the new configuration leading to unexpected
behaviors including unnecessary OOM kills.

This patch resolves the issue by adding wb_domain_size_changed() which
resets ->dirty_limit[_tstmp] and making memcg call it on configuration
changes.
