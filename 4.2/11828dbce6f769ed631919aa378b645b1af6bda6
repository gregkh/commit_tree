iwlwifi: mvm: Avoid accessing Null pointer when setting igtk

Sometimes when setting an igtk key the station maybe NULL.
In the of case igtk the function will skip to the end, and
try to print sta->addr, if sta is Null - we will access a
Null pointer.

Avoid accessing a Null pointer when setting a igtk key &
the sta == NULL, and print a default MAC address instead.
