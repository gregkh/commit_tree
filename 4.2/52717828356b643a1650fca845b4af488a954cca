iommu/amd: Set global dma_ops if swiotlb is disabled

Some AMD systems also have non-PCI devices which can do DMA.
Those can't be handled by the AMD IOMMU, as the hardware can
only handle PCI. These devices would end up with no dma_ops,
as neither the per-device nor the global dma_ops will get
set. SWIOTLB provides global dma_ops when it is active, so
make sure there are global dma_ops too when swiotlb is
disabled.
