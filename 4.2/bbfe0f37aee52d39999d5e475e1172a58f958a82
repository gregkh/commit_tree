irda: irda-usb: use msecs_to_jiffies for conversions

API compliance scanning with coccinelle flagged:

Converting milliseconds to jiffies by "val * HZ / 1000" is technically
is not a clean solution as it does not handle all corner cases correctly.
By changing the conversion to use msecs_to_jiffies(val) conversion is
correct in all cases.

in the current code:
  mod_timer(&self->rx_defer_timer, jiffies + (10 * HZ / 1000));
for HZ < 100 (e.g. CONFIG_HZ == 64|32 in alpha) this effectively results
in no delay at all.

Patch was compile tested for x86_64_defconfig (implies CONFIG_USB_IRDA=m)

Patch is against 4.1-rc4 (localversion-next is -next-20150522)
