rcu: Fix missing task information during rcu-preempt stall

The first item list_for_each_entry_continue(alist) iterates over is
alist->next, rather than alist itself. Consequently,
rcu_print_detail_task_stall_rnp() skips the task referenced by gp_tasks.

Use gp_tasks->prev as the argument to list_for_each_entry_continue()
instead.
