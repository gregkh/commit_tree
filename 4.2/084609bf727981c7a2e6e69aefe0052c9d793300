leds / PM: fix hibernation on arm when gpio-led used with CPU led trigger

Setting a dev_pm_ops suspend/resume pair of callbacks but not a set of
hibernation callbacks means those pm functions will not be
called upon hibernation - that leads to system crash on ARM during
freezing if gpio-led is used in combination with CPU led trigger.
It may happen after freeze_noirq stage (GPIO is suspended)
and before syscore_suspend stage (CPU led trigger is suspended)
- usually when disable_nonboot_cpus() is called.

Log:
  PM: noirq freeze of devices complete after 1.425 msecs
  Disabling non-boot CPUs ...
    ^ system may crash or stuck here with message (TI AM572x)

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3100 at drivers/bus/omap_l3_noc.c:148 l3_interrupt_handler+0x22c/0x370()
  44000000.ocp:L3 Custom Error: MASTER MPU TARGET L4_PER1_P3 (Idle): Data Access in Supervisor mode during Functional access

  CPU1: shutdown
    ^ or here

Fix this by using SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS, which appropriately
assigns the suspend and hibernation callbacks and move
led_suspend/led_resume under CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to avoid
build warnings.
