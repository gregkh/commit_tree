arm64: smp: consistently use error codes

cpu_kill currently returns one for success and zero for failure, which
is unlike all the other cpu_operations, which return zero for success
and an error code upon failure. This difference is unnecessarily
confusing.

Make cpu_kill consistent with the other cpu_operations.
