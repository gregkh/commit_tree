mm: cma: mark cma_bitmap_maxno() inline in header

cma_bitmap_maxno() was marked as static and not static inline, which can
cause warnings about this function not being used if this file is included
in a file that does not call that function, and violates the conventions
used elsewhere.  The two options are to move the function implementation
back to mm/cma.c or make it inline here, and it's simple enough for the
latter to make sense.
