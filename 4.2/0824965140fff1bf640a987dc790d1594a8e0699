PCI: Propagate the "ignore hotplug" setting to parent

Refine the mechanism introduced by commit f244d8b623da ("ACPIPHP / radeon /
nouveau: Fix VGA switcheroo problem related to hotplug") to propagate the
ignore_hotplug setting of the device to its parent bridge in case hotplug
notifications related to the graphics adapter switching are given for the
bridge rather than for the device itself (they need to be ignored in both
cases).
