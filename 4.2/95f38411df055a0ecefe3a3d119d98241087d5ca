netns: use a spin_lock to protect nsid management

Before this patch, nsid were protected by the rtnl lock. The goal of this
patch is to be able to find a nsid without needing to hold the rtnl lock.

The next patch will introduce a netlink socket option to listen to all
netns that have a nsid assigned into the netns where the socket is opened.
Thus, it's important to call rtnl_net_notifyid() outside the spinlock, to
avoid a recursive lock (nsid are notified via rtnl). This was the main
reason of the previous patch.
