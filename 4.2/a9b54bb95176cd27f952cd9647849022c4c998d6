drivers: xen-blkfront: only talk_to_blkback() when in XenbusStateInitialising

Patch 69b91ede5cab843dcf345c28bd1f4b5a99dacd9b
"drivers: xen-blkback: delay pending_req allocation to connect_ring"
exposed an problem that Xen blkfront has. There is a race
with XenStored and the drivers such that we can see two:

vbd vbd-268440320: blkfront:blkback_changed to state 2.
vbd vbd-268440320: blkfront:blkback_changed to state 2.
vbd vbd-268440320: blkfront:blkback_changed to state 4.

state changes to XenbusStateInitWait ('2'). The end result is that
blkback_changed() receives two notify and calls twice setup_blkring().

While the backend driver may only get the first setup_blkring() which is
wrong and reads out-dated (or reads them as they are being updated
with new ring-ref values).

The end result is that the ring ends up being incorrectly set.

The other drivers in the tree have such checks already in.
