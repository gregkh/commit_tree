__bitmap_parselist: fix bug in empty string handling

bitmap_parselist("", &mask, nmaskbits) will erroneously set bit zero in
the mask.  The same bug is visible in cpumask_parselist() since it is
layered on top of the bitmask code, e.g.  if you boot with "isolcpus=",
you will actually end up with cpu zero isolated.

The bug was introduced in commit 4b060420a596 ("bitmap, irq: add
smp_affinity_list interface to /proc/irq") when bitmap_parselist() was
generalized to support userspace as well as kernelspace.
