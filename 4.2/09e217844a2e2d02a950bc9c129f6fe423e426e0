crypto: testmgr - Wrap the LHS in expressions of the form !x == y

In the test manager, there are a number of if-statements with expressions of
the form !x == y that incur warnings with gcc-5 of the following form:

../crypto/testmgr.c: In function '__test_aead':
../crypto/testmgr.c:523:12: warning: logical not is only applied to the left hand side of comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
   if (!ret == template[i].fail) {
            ^

By converting the 'fail' member of struct aead_testvec and struct
cipher_testvec to a bool, we can get rid of the warnings.
