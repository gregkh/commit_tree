ath10k: fix arvif->wep_keys clearing

The variable should be cleared regardless of
whether there's a peer associated with the key or
not.

This fixes case when user first associates with 2
WEP keys and then disconnects and connects with 1
WEP key. This resulted in WEP key count being 2 in
the driver leading to default keyidx fixup
failure.
