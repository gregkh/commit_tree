kernfs: Add support for always empty directories.

Add a new function kernfs_create_empty_dir that can be used to create
directory that can not be modified.

Update the code to use make_empty_dir_inode when reporting a
permanently empty directory to the vfs.

Update the code to not allow adding to permanently empty directories.
