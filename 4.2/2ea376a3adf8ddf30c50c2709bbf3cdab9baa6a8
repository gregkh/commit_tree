crypto: mv_cesa - request registers memory region

The mv_cesa driver does not request the CESA registers memory region.
Since we're about to add a new CESA driver, we need to make sure only one
of these drivers probe the CESA device, and requesting the registers memory
region is a good way to achieve that.
