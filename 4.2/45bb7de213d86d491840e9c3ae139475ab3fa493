usb: dwc3: setup phys earlier

This allows dwc3_phy_setup() to be more useful later. There
is nothing preventing the PHY configuration registers from
being programmed early. They do not loose their context in
soft reset.

There are however other PHY related operations that should
be executed before the driver request handles to the PHYs,
such as registering DWC3's ULPI interface, which can now be
done in dwc3_phy_setup().

Also, if there ever was need for the two 100ms delays in
dwc3_phy_setup() there isn't anymore. The PHYs are now reset
after the PHY interfaces are setup.
