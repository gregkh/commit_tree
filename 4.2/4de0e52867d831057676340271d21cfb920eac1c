ARCv2: STAR 9000814690: Really Re-enable interrupts to avoid deadlocks

The issue was, on HS when interrupt is taken, IRQ_ACT is set and that is
NOT cleared unless we do RTIE (or manually clear it). Linux interrupt
handling has top and bottom halves. Latter lead to softirqs (which can
reschedule) AND expect interrupts to be REALLY re-enabled which was NOT
happening for us since we only SETI, dont clear IRQ_ACT

So we can have a state when both cores have taken interrupt (IRQ_ACT set),
get rescheduled, both send IPI and wait in CSD lock which will never be
cleared as cores can't take the pending IPI IRQ due to existing IRQ_ACT
set.

So local_irq_enable() now drops the IRQ_ACT.act bit to re-enable IRQs.
