libnvdimm, pmem: add libnvdimm support to the pmem driver

nd_pmem attaches to persistent memory regions and namespaces emitted by
the libnvdimm subsystem, and, same as the original pmem driver, presents
the system-physical-address range as a block device.

The existing e820-type-12 to pmem setup is converted to an nvdimm_bus
that emits an nd_namespace_io device.

Note that the X in 'pmemX' is now derived from the parent region.  This
provides some stability to the pmem devices names from boot-to-boot.
The minor numbers are also more predictable by passing 0 to
alloc_disk().
