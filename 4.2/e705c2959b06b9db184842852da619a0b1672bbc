PCI: pciehp: Drop pointless ACPI-based "slot detection" check

Jarod Wilson reports that ExpressCard hotplug doesn't work on HP ZBook G2.
The problem turns out to be the ACPI-based "slot detection" code called
from pciehp_probe() which uses questionable heuristics based on what ACPI
objects are present for the PCIe port device to figure out whether to
register a hotplug slot for that port.

That code is used if there is at least one PCIe port having an ACPI device
configuration object related to hotplug (such as _EJ0 or _RMV), and the
Thunderbolt port on the ZBook has _RMV.  Of course, Thunderbolt and PCIe
native hotplug need not be mutually exclusive (as they aren't on the
ZBook), so that rule is simply incorrect.

Moreover, the ACPI-based "slot detection" check does not add any value if
pciehp_probe() is called at all and the service type of the device object
it has been called for is PCIE_PORT_SERVICE_HP, because PCIe hotplug
services are only registered if the _OSC handshake in acpi_pci_root_add()
allows the kernel to control the PCIe native hotplug feature.  No more
checks need to be carried out to decide whether or not to register a native
PCIe hotlug slot in that case.

For the above reasons, make pciehp_probe() check if it has been called for
the right service type and drop the pointless ACPI-based "slot detection"
check from it.  Also remove the entire code whose only user is that check
(the entire pciehp_acpi.c file goes away as a result) and drop function
headers related to it from the internal pciehp header file.
