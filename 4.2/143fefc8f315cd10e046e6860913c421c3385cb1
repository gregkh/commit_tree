MIPS: Fix erroneous JR emulation for MIPS R6

Commit 5f9f41c474befb4ebbc40b27f65bb7d649241581 ("MIPS: kernel: Prepare
the JR instruction for emulation on MIPS R6") added support for
emulating the JR instruction on MIPS R6 cores but that introduced a bug
which could be triggered when hitting a JALR opcode because the code used
the wrong field in the 'r_format' struct to determine the instruction
opcode. This lead to crashes because an emulated JALR instruction was
treated as a JR one when the R6 emulator was turned off.
