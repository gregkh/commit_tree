block: loop: convert to per-device workqueue

Documentation/workqueue.txt:
	If there is dependency among multiple work items used
	during memory reclaim, they should be queued to separate
	wq each with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Loop devices can be stacked, so we have to convert to per-device
workqueue. One example is Fedora live CD.
