gpio: omap: rework omap_x_irq_shutdown to touch only irqs specific registers

The GPIO Chip and GPIO IRQ Chip functionality are essentially orthogonal,
so GPIO IRQ Chip implementation shouldn't touch GPIO specific
registers and vise versa.

Hence, rework omap_gpio_irq_shutdown and try to touch only irqs specific
registers:
- don't configure GPIO as input (it, actually, should be already configured
  as input).
- don't clear debounce configuration if GPIO is still used as GPIO.
  We need to take in to account here commit c9c55d921115
  ("gpio/omap: fix off-mode bug: clear debounce settings on free/reset").

Also remove omap_reset_gpio() function as it is not used any more.
