bridge_netfilter: No ICMP packet on IPv4 fragmentation error

When bridge netfilter re-fragments an IP packet for output, all
packets that can not be re-fragmented to their original input size
should be silently discarded.

However, current bridge netfilter output path generates an ICMP packet
with 'size exceeded MTU' message for such packets, this is a bug.

This patch refactors the ip_fragment() API to allow two separate
use cases. The bridge netfilter user case will not
send ICMP, the routing output will, as before.
