target: Drop se_lun->lun_active for existing percpu lun_ref

With se_port_t and t10_alua_tg_pt_gp_member being absored into se_lun,
there is no need for an extra atomic_t based reference count for PR
ALL_TG_PT=1 and ALUA access state transition.

Go ahead and use the existing percpu se_lun->lun_ref instead, and
convert the two special cases to percpu_ref_tryget_live() to avoid
se_lun if transport_clear_lun_ref() has already been invoked to
shutdown the se_lun.
