um: Catch unprotected user memory access

If the kernel tries to access user memory without copy_from_user()
a trap will happen as kernel and userspace run in different processes
on the host side. Currently this special page fault cannot be resolved
and will happen over and over again. As result UML will lockup.
This patch allows the page fault code to detect that situation and
causes a panic() such that the root cause of the unprotected memory
access can be found and fixed.
