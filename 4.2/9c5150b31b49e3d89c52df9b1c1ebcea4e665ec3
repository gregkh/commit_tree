rtc: NTP: Add CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC_DEVICE for NTP synchronization

Currently, CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC uses CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE which
is originally used by CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS, but this rtc device has
some limiations, for example, it must be battery-backed, be able
to work with irq off and through system suspension, etc.

So add CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC_DEVICE used exclusively for CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC,
it is more lenient compared to CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE, and could
be assigned any available RTC in the system.

Default value is CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE which is "rtc0" by default.
After this patch, NTP will sync up "rtc0" by default.
