nfs: verify open flags before allowing open

Commit 9597c13b forbade opens with O_APPEND|O_DIRECT for NFSv4:

    nfs: verify open flags before allowing an atomic open

    Currently, you can open a NFSv4 file with O_APPEND|O_DIRECT, but cannot
    fcntl(F_SETFL,...) with those flags. This flag combination is explicitly
    forbidden on NFSv3 opens, and it seems like it should also be on NFSv4.

However, you can still open a file with O_DIRECT|O_APPEND if there exists a
cached dentry for the file because nfs4_file_open() is used instead of
nfs_atomic_open() and the check is bypassed.  Add the check in
nfs4_file_open() as well.
