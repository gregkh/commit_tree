mm: Fix bugs in region_is_ram()

region_is_ram() looks up the iomem_resource table to check if
a target range is in RAM.  However, it always returns with -1
due to invalid range checks. It always breaks the loop at the
first entry of the table.

Another issue is that it compares p->flags and flags, but it always
fails. flags is declared as int, which makes it as a negative value
with IORESOURCE_BUSY (0x80000000) set while p->flags is unsigned long.

Fix the range check and flags so that region_is_ram() works as
advertised.
