ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Calculate BCLK using TDM slots and remove channels rule

The McASP driver currently always sends as many slots or channels to a
i2s-wire as there are configured tdm_slots (see mcasp_i2s_hw_param()).
Thus the BLCK rate does not depend on the amount of channels, just the
configure amount of tdm-slots.
