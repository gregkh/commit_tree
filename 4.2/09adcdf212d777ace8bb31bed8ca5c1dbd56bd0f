AVR32/time: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate avr32 driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

We want to call cpu_idle_poll_ctrl() in shutdown only if we were in
oneshot or resume state earlier. Create another variable to save this
information and check that in shutdown callback.
