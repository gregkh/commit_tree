OMAPDSS: HDMI4: Set correct CC for 8-channels layout

OMAP4 HDMI IP uses the 8-channel layout with 8-channel speaker
allocation mask when transmitting more than two channels.  But
the channel count field (CC) of the Audio InfoFrame's DB1 is
not updated for 8-channels.

As per HDMI Compliance Test 7.31 "Audio InfoFrame", CC = 7 is
required for 8-channels CA masks (0x13 and 0x1F).
