x86/fpu: Clean up and fix MXCSR handling

The code has the following problems:

 - it uses a single global 'fx_scratch' area that multiple CPUs could
   write into simultaneously, in theory.

 - it wastes 512 bytes of .data for something that is only rarely used.

Fix this by moving the state buffer to the stack. Note that while
this is 512 bytes, we don't ever call this function in very deep
callchains, so its stack usage should not be a problem.

Also add comments to explain the magic 0x0000ffbf default value.
