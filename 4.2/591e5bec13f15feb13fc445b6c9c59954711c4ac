irqchip/gicv3-its: Fix mapping of LPIs to collections

The GICv3 ITS architecture allows a given [DevID, EventID] pair to be
translated to a [LPI, Collection] pair, where DevID is the device writing
the MSI, EventID is the payload being written, LPI is the actual
interrupt number, and Collection is roughly equivalent to a target CPU.

Each LPI can be mapped to a separate collection, but the ITS driver
insists on maintaining the collection on a device basis, instead of doing
it on a per interrupt basis.

This is obviously flawed, and this patch fixes it by adding a per interrupt
index that indicates which collection number is in use.
