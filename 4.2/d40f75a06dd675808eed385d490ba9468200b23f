writeback, blkcg: restructure blk_{set|clear}_queue_congested()

blk_{set|clear}_queue_congested() take @q and set or clear,
respectively, the congestion state of its bdi's root wb.  Because bdi
used to be able to handle congestion state only on the root wb, the
callers of those functions tested whether the congestion is on the
root blkcg and skipped if not.

This is cumbersome and makes implementation of per cgroup
bdi_writeback congestion state propagation difficult.  This patch
renames blk_{set|clear}_queue_congested() to
blk_{set|clear}_congested(), and makes them take request_list instead
of request_queue and test whether the specified request_list is the
root one before updating bdi_writeback congestion state.  This makes
the tests in the callers unnecessary and simplifies them.

As there are no external users of these functions, the definitions are
moved from include/linux/blkdev.h to block/blk-core.c.

This patch doesn't introduce any noticeable behavior difference.
