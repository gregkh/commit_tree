vfs: Remove incorrect debugging WARN in prepend_path

The warning message in prepend_path is unclear and outdated.  It was
added as a warning that the mechanism for generating names of pseudo
files had been removed from prepend_path and d_dname should be used
instead.  Unfortunately the warning reads like a general warning,
making it unclear what to do with it.

Remove the warning.  The transition it was added to warn about is long
over, and I added code several years ago which in rare cases causes
the warning to fire on legitimate code, and the warning is now firing
and scaring people for no good reason.
