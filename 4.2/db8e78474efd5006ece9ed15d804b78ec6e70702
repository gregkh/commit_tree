serial: tegra: check the count and read if any from dma

It is only necessary to read data from the dma buffer when the count
value is non-zero and hence, tegra_uart_copy_rx_to_tty() so only be
called when this is the case.

Although, this was being tested for in two places, there is a third
place where this was not tested. However, instead of adding another
if-statement prior to calling tegra_uart_copy_rx_to_tty(), move the test
inside the function.
