tools: Copy lib/hweight.c from the kernel sources

Instead of accessing it directly, as it uses EXPORT_SYMBOL, that has
no meaning in tools/perf and because we removed the stubs for it, i.e.
we removed the tools/include/linux/export.h file.

This fixes the build for the detached tarball sources cases and removes
one more source of entanglement with the kernel sources.
