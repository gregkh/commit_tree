staging: comedi: 8255: fix I/O region leak on failure

The Comedi "8255" driver does not clean up properly on failure.  It can
leave requested I/O port regions unreleased.  Specifically, the Comedi
"attach" handler (`dev_8255_attach()`) requests a specified I/O port
region before calling `subdev_8255_init()` to set up the subdevice.  If
that fails, the "attach" handler returns an error and the Comedi core
will call the "detach" handler (`dev_8255_detach()`) to clean up.  The
"detach" handler is responsible for releasing the I/O port regions
successfully requested by the "attach" handler.  Unfortunately, it is
unable to obtain the base address of the region if the call to
`subdev_8255_init()` failed.

Fix the I/O region leak by releasing the region in the "attach" handler
directly if the call to `subdev_8255_init()` fails.
