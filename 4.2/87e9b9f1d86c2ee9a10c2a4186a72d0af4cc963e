PM / sleep: Make suspend-to-idle-specific code depend on CONFIG_SUSPEND

Since idle_should_freeze() is defined to always return 'false'
for CONFIG_SUSPEND unset, all of the code depending on it in
cpuidle_idle_call() is not necessary in that case.

Make that code depend on CONFIG_SUSPEND too to avoid building it
when it is not going to be used.
