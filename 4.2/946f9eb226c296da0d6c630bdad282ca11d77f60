tcp: improve REUSEADDR/NOREUSEADDR cohabitation

inet_csk_get_port() randomization effort tends to spread
sockets on all the available range (ip_local_port_range)

This is unfortunate because SO_REUSEADDR sockets have
less requirements than non SO_REUSEADDR ones.

If an application uses SO_REUSEADDR hint, it is to try to
allow source ports being shared.

So instead of picking a random port number in ip_local_port_range,
lets try first in first half of the range.

This gives more chances to use upper half of the range for the
sockets with strong requirements (not using SO_REUSEADDR)

Note this patch does not add a new sysctl, and only changes
the way we try to pick port number.
