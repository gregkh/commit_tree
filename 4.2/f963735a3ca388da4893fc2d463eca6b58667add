cpufreq: Create for_each_{in}active_policy()

policy->cpus is cleared unconditionally now on hotplug-out of a CPU and
it can be checked to know if a policy is active or not. Create helper
routines to iterate over all active/inactive policies, based on
policy->cpus field.

Replace all instances of for_each_policy() with for_each_active_policy()
to make them iterate only for active policies. (We haven't made changes
yet to keep inactive policies in the same list, but that will be
followed in a later patch).
