hrtimer: Get rid of softirq time

The softirq time field in the clock bases is an optimization from the
early days of hrtimers. It provides a coarse "jiffies" like time
mostly for self rearming timers.

But that comes with a price:
    - Larger code size
    - Extra storage space
    - Duplicated functions with really small differences
   
The benefit of this is optimization is marginal for contemporary
systems.

Consolidate everything on the high resolution timer
implementation. This makes further optimizations possible.
