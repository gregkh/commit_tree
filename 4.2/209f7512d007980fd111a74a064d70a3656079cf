ocfs2: fix BUG in ocfs2_downconvert_thread_do_work()

The "BUG_ON(list_empty(&osb->blocked_lock_list))" in
ocfs2_downconvert_thread_do_work can be triggered in the following case:

ocfs2dc has firstly saved osb->blocked_lock_count to local varibale
processed, and then processes the dentry lockres.  During the dentry
put, it calls iput and then deletes rw, inode and open lockres from
blocked list in ocfs2_mark_lockres_freeing.  And this causes the
variable `processed' to not reflect the number of blocked lockres to be
processed, which triggers the BUG.
