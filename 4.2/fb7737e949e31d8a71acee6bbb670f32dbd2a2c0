hwspinlock/core: add device tree support

This patch adds a new OF-friendly API of_hwspin_lock_get_id()
for hwspinlock clients to use/request locks from a hwspinlock
device instantiated through a device-tree blob. This new API
can be used by hwspinlock clients to get the id for a specific
lock using the phandle + args specifier, so that it can be
requested using the available hwspin_lock_request_specific()
API.
