net/mlx4_core: Modify port values when generting EQEs for VFs

As part of enabling single ported VFs over IB ports we need to handle
some of the flows for generting EQ events for VFs which don't come
into play under Eth ports.

This mainly includes port management events derived from changes of the
phyiscal port (lid change, client re-register, down/up, etc), VF pkey table
changes and VF guid changes initiated by the IB driver.

(1) make sure that events are generated only for VFs sitting on
    the relevant physical port (under the ALL_SLAVES flow).

(2) before generating the event, convert from physical (one or two)
    to VF port (always equals one).
