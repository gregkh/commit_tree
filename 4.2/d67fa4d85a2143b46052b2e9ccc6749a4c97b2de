sunrpc: turn swapper_enable/disable functions into rpc_xprt_ops

RDMA xprts don't have a sock_xprt, but an rdma_xprt, so the
xs_swapper_enable/disable functions will likely oops when fed an RDMA
xprt. Turn these functions into rpc_xprt_ops so that that doesn't
occur. For now the RDMA versions are no-ops that just return -EINVAL
on an attempt to swapon.
