netfilter: nfnetlink: keep going batch handling on missing modules

After a fresh boot with no modules in place at all and a large rulesets, the
existing nfnetlink_rcv_batch() funcion can take long time to commit the ruleset
due to the many abort path. This is specifically a problem for the existing
client of this code, ie. nf_tables, since it results in several
synchronize_rcu() call in a row.

This patch changes the policy to keep full batch processing on missing modules
errors so we abort only once.
