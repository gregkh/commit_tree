thermal: Add QPNP PMIC temperature alarm driver

Add support for the temperature alarm peripheral found inside
Qualcomm plug-and-play (QPNP) PMIC chips. The temperature alarm
peripheral outputs a pulse on an interrupt line whenever the
thermal over temperature stage value changes.

Register a thermal sensor. The temperature reported by this thermal
sensor device should reflect the actual PMIC die temperature if an
ADC is present on the given PMIC. If no ADC is present, then the
reported temperature should be estimated from the over temperature
stage value.
