mac80211: disconnect TDLS stations on STA CSA

When a station does a channel switch, it's not well defined what its TDLS
peers would do. Avoid a situation when the local side marks a potentially
disconnected peer as a TDLS peer.
Keeping peers connected through CSA is doubly problematic with the upcoming
TDLS WIDER-BW feature which allows peers to widen the BSS channel. The
new channel transitioned-to might not be compatible and would require
a re-negotiation anyway.

Make sure to disallow new TDLS link during CSA.
