drm/i915: Make scaler_id check in check_crtc_state work for all gens

During check_crtc_state, scaler_id mispatch is being reported for HSW.
This is applicable for skl+ and not for HSW. It is introduced by
commit id:

        drm/i915: skylake panel fitting using shared scalers

This patch will make sure that we leave scaler_id as 0 for platforms
before skl and set for skl+ only. This way scaler_id check during
check_crtc_state will pass for both prior to skl and skl+ platforms.

v2:
-Leave scaler_id as 0 for gen < 9 (Daniel)
