tcp: add TCPWinProbe and TCPKeepAlive SNMP counters

Diagnosing problems related to Window Probes has been hard because
we lack a counter.

TCPWinProbe counts the number of ACK packets a sender has to send
at regular intervals to make sure a reverse ACK packet opening back
a window had not been lost.

TCPKeepAlive counts the number of ACK packets sent to keep TCP
flows alive (SO_KEEPALIVE)
