rds: fix an integer overflow test in rds_info_getsockopt()

"len" is a signed integer.  We check that len is not negative, so it
goes from zero to INT_MAX.  PAGE_SIZE is unsigned long so the comparison
is type promoted to unsigned long.  ULONG_MAX - 4095 is a higher than
INT_MAX so the condition can never be true.

I don't know if this is harmful but it seems safe to limit "len" to
INT_MAX - 4095.
