KVM: s390: clear floating interrupt bitmap and parameters

commit 6d3da24141 ("KVM: s390: deliver floating interrupts in order
of priority") introduced a regression for the reset handling.

We don't clear the bitmap of pending floating interrupts
and interrupt parameters. This could result in stale interrupts
even after a reset. Let's fix this by clearing the pending bitmap
and the parameters for service and machine check interrupts.
