Input: alps - only Dell laptops have separate button bits for v2 dualpoint sticks

It turns out that only Dell laptops have the separate button bits for
v2 dualpoint sticks and that commit 92bac83dd79e ("Input: alps - non
interleaved V2 dualpoint has separate stick button bits") causes
regressions on Toshiba laptops.

This commit adds a check for Dell laptops to the code for handling these
extra button bits, fixing this regression.

This patch has been tested on a Dell Latitude D620 to make sure that it
does not reintroduce the original problem.
