f2fs: introduce discard_map for f2fs_trim_fs

This patch adds a bitmap for discard issues from f2fs_trim_fs.
There-in rule is to issue discard commands only for invalidated blocks
after mount.
Once mount is done, f2fs_trim_fs trims out whole invalid area.
After ehn, it will not issue and discrads redundantly.
