dmaengine: omap-dma: Remove mapping between virtual channels and requests

Do not direct map the virtual channels to sDMA request number. When the
sDMA is behind of a crossbar this direct mapping can cause situations when
certain channel can not be requested since the crossbar request number
will no longer match with the sDMA request line.
The direct mapping for virtual channels with HW request lines will make it
harder to implement MEM_TO_MEM mode for the driver.
