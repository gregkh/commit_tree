wil6210: support WSC for STA mode

WSC connection is secure (privacy bit set in various frames)
but authentication suite, keys etc. are absent.

Support this mode in the connect WMI command. Detect WSC by
having 'sme->privacy' and no RSN IE. Inform firmware about WSC
session by setting dot11_auth_mode to WMI_AUTH11_WSC.
