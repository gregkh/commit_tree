netfilter: nftables: Do not run chains in the wrong network namespace

Currenlty nf_tables chains added in one network namespace are being
run in all network namespace.  The issues are myriad with the simplest
being an unprivileged user can cause any network packets to be dropped.

Address this by simply not running nf_tables chains in the wrong
network namespace.
