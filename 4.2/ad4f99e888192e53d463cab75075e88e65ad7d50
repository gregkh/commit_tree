revert "s390/mm: change HPAGE_SHIFT type to int"

Heiko noticed that the current check for hugepage support on s390 is a
little bit too harsh as systems which do not support will crash.

The reason is that pageblock_order can now get negative when we set
HPAGE_SHIFT to 0.  To avoid all this and to avoid opening another can of
worms with enabling HUGETLB_PAGE_SIZE_VARIABLE I think it would be best
to simply allow architectures to define their own hugepages_supported().

This patch (of 4): revert commit cf54e2fce51c ("s390/mm: change
HPAGE_SHIFT type to int") in preparation.
