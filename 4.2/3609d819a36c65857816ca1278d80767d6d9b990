powerpc: Make doorbell check preemption safe

Doorbell can be used to cause ipi on cpus which are sibling threads on
the same core. So icp_native_cause_ipi checks if the destination cpu
is a sibling thread of the current cpu and uses doorbell in such cases.

But while running with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, since this section is
preemtible, we can run into issues if after we check if the destination
cpu is a sibling cpu, the task gets migrated from a sibling cpu to a
cpu on another core.

Fix this by using get_cpu()/ put_cpu()
