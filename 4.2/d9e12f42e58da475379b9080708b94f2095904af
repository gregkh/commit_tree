seccomp: simplify seccomp_prepare_filter and reuse bpf_prepare_filter

Remove the calls to bpf_check_classic(), bpf_convert_filter() and
bpf_migrate_runtime() and let bpf_prepare_filter() take care of that
instead.

seccomp_check_filter() is passed to bpf_prepare_filter() so that it
gets called from there, after bpf_check_classic().

We can now remove exposure of two internal classic BPF functions
previously used by seccomp. The export of bpf_check_classic() symbol,
previously known as sk_chk_filter(), was there since pre git times,
and no in-tree module was using it, therefore remove it.

Joint work with Daniel Borkmann.
