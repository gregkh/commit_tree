PM / clk: Fix clock error check in __pm_clk_add()

In the final iteration of commit 245bd6f6af8a62a2 ("PM / clock_ops: Add
pm_clk_add_clk()"), a refcount increment was added by Grygorii Strashko.
However, the accompanying IS_ERR() check operates on the wrong clock
pointer, which is always zero at this point, i.e. not an error.
This may lead to a NULL pointer dereference later, when __clk_get()
tries to dereference an error pointer.

Check the passed clock pointer instead to fix this.
