cxgb4/cxgb4vf: function and argument name cleanup

This patch changes variable name 'fn' to 'pf' of structure adapter.
A 'fn' usually stands for PCI function which could be a PF or a VF.
However, the use of this particular variable is explicitly limited to PF
only. So, be specific about it in the variable name.

Also corrects arguments passed for fn t4_ofld_eq_free, t4_ctrl_eq_free,
t4_eth_eq_free, t4_iq_free, t4_alloc_vi, t4_fw_hello, t4_wr_mbox and
t4_cfg_pfvf function.

Also renames cxgb4_t4_bar2_sge_qregs to t4_bar2_sge_qregs and renames
the latter function name in cxgb4vf driver to t4vf_bar2_sge_qregs to
avoid conflicts. Also fixes alignment for these function.
