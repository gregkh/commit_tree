spi: sirf: request and free cs gpio in setup and cleanup callbacks

move spi controller's gpio request work out from probe() to spi device
register stage, so after spi device register spi controller can deactive
device's gpio chipselect. old code can't do it because gpio request has
not be done until device register is finised in spi_bitbang_start.
and add cleanup function to free CS gpio.
