perf tools: Fix function declarations needed by parse-events.y

Patch "perf tools: Add location to pmu event terms" moved declarations
for parse_events_term__num() and parse_events_term__str() so that they
were no longer visible in parse-events.y. That can result in segfaults
as the arguments no longer need match the function prototype.

Move the declarations back, changing YYLTYPE pointers to
pointers-to-void because YYLTYPE is not generated until parse-events.y
is processed.
