rndis_wlan: harmless issue calling set_bit()

These are used like:

	set_bit(WORK_LINK_UP, &priv->work_pending);

The problem is that set_bit() takes the actual bit number and not a mask
so static checkers get upset.  It doesn't affect run time because we do
it consistently, but we may as well clean it up.
