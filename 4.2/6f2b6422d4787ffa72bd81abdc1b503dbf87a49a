EDAC, altera: Do not allow suspend when EDAC is enabled

Suspend-to-RAM and EDAC support are mutually exclusive on SOCFPGA. If
EDAC is enabled, it will prevent the platform from going into suspend.

The reason is that the IRQ vectors for OCRAM reside on DDR and in
Suspend-to-RAM mode we're executing out of OCRAM. If an ECC error
occurs, we can't handle it so it was decided to make them mutually
exclusive.
