Btrfs: fix hang when failing to submit bio of directIO

The hang is uncoverd by generic/019.

btrfs_endio_direct_write() skips the "finish_ordered_fn" part when it hits
an error, thus those added ordered extents will never get processed, which
block processes that waiting for them via btrfs_start_ordered_extent().

This fixes the above, and meanwhile finish_ordered_fn will do the space
accounting work.
