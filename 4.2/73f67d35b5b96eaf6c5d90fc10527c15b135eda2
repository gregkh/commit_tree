Documentation: devicetree: dma: Binding documentation for TI DMA crossbar

The DRA7x has more peripherals with DMA requests than the sDMA can handle:
205 vs 127. All DMA requests are routed through the DMA crossbar, which can
be configured to route selected incoming DMA requests to specific request
line of the DMA controller.
