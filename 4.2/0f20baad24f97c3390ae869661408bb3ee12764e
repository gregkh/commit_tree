[media] ts2020: Copy loop_through from the config to the internal data

Copy the loop_through setting from the ts2020_config struct to the internal
ts2020_priv struct so that it can actually be used.

Whilst we're at it, group the bitfields together in the same order in both
structs so that the compiler has a good chance to copy them in one go.
