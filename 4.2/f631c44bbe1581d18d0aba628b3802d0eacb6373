ipvlan: Always set broadcast bit in multicast filter

Earlier tricks of setting broadcast bit only when IPv4 address is added
onto interface are not good enough especially when autoconf comes in play.
Setting them on always is performance drag but now that multicast /
broadcast is not processed in fast-path; enabling broadcast will let
autoconf work correctly without affecting performance characteristics of
the device.
