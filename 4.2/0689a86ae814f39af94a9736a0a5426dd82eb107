ALSA: usb-audio: Add MIDI support for Steinberg MI2/MI4

The Steinberg MI2 and MI4 interfaces are compatible with the USB class
audio spec, but the MIDI part of the devices is reported as a vendor
specific interface.

This patch adds entries to quirks-table.h to recognize the MIDI
endpoints. Audio functionality was already working and is unaffected by
this change.
