fs: sysfs: don't pass count == 0 to bin file readers

If count == 0 bytes are requested by a reader, sysfs_kf_bin_read()
deliberately returns 0 without passing a potentially harmful value to
some externally defined underlying battr->read() function.

However in case of (pos == size && count) the next clause always sets
count to 0 and this value is handed over to battr->read().

The change intends to make obsolete (and remove later) a redundant
sanity check in battr->read(), if it is present, or add more
protection to struct bin_attribute users, who does not care about
input arguments.
