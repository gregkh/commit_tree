module: Sanitize RCU usage and locking

Currently the RCU usage in module is an inconsistent mess of RCU and
RCU-sched, this is broken for CONFIG_PREEMPT where synchronize_rcu()
does not imply synchronize_sched().

Most usage sites use preempt_{dis,en}able() which is RCU-sched, but
(most of) the modification sites use synchronize_rcu(). With the
exception of the module bug list, which actually uses RCU.

Convert everything over to RCU-sched.

Furthermore add lockdep asserts to all sites, because it's not at all
clear to me the required locking is observed, esp. on exported
functions.
