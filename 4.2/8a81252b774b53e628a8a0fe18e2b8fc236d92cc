fs/file.c: don't acquire files->file_lock in fd_install()

Mateusz Guzik reported :

 Currently obtaining a new file descriptor results in locking fdtable
 twice - once in order to reserve a slot and second time to fill it.

Holding the spinlock in __fd_install() is needed in case a resize is
done, or to prevent a resize.

Mateusz provided an RFC patch and a micro benchmark :
  http://people.redhat.com/~mguzik/pipebench.c

A resize is an unlikely operation in a process lifetime,
as table size is at least doubled at every resize.

We can use RCU instead of the spinlock.

__fd_install() must wait if a resize is in progress.

The resize must block new __fd_install() callers from starting,
and wait that ongoing install are finished (synchronize_sched())

resize should be attempted by a single thread to not waste resources.

rcu_sched variant is used, as __fd_install() and expand_fdtable() run
from process context.

It gives us a ~30% speedup using pipebench on a dual Intel(R) Xeon(R)
CPU E5-2696 v2 @ 2.50GHz
