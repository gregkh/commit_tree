iio: adc: add support for Berlin

This patch adds the support of the Berlin ADC, available on Berlin SoCs.
This ADC has 8 channels available, with one connected to a temperature
sensor.

The particularity here, is that the temperature sensor connected to the
ADC has its own registers, and both the ADC and the temperature sensor
must be configured when using it.
