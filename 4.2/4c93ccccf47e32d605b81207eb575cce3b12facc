Drivers: hv: fcopy: switch to using the hvutil_device_state state machine

Switch to using the hvutil_device_state state machine from using 3 different state variables:
fcopy_transaction.active, opened, and in_hand_shake.

State transitions are:
-> HVUTIL_DEVICE_INIT when driver loads or on device release
-> HVUTIL_READY if the handshake was successful
-> HVUTIL_HOSTMSG_RECEIVED when there is a non-negotiation message from the host
-> HVUTIL_USERSPACE_REQ after userspace daemon read the message
   -> HVUTIL_USERSPACE_RECV after/if userspace has replied
-> HVUTIL_READY after we respond to the host
-> HVUTIL_DEVICE_DYING on driver unload

In hv_fcopy_onchannelcallback() process ICMSGTYPE_NEGOTIATE messages even when
the userspace daemon is disconnected, otherwise we can make the host think
we don't support FCOPY and disable the service completely.
