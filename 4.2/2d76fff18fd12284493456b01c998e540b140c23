dm: cleanup methods that requeue requests

More often than not a request that is requeued _is_ mapped (meaning the
clone request is allocated and clone->q is initialized).  Rename
dm_requeue_unmapped_original_request() to avoid potential confusion due
to function name containing "unmapped".

Also, remove dm_requeue_unmapped_request() since callers can easily call
the dm_requeue_original_request() directly.
