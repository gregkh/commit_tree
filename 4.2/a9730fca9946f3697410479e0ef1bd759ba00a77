Fix kmalloc slab creation sequence

This patch restores the slab creation sequence that was broken by commit
4066c33d0308f8 and also reverts the portions that introduced the
KMALLOC_LOOP_XXX macros. Those can never really work since the slab creation
is much more complex than just going from a minimum to a maximum number.

The latest upstream kernel boots cleanly on my machine with a 64 bit x86
configuration under KVM using either SLAB or SLUB.

Fixes: 4066c33d0308f8 ("support the slub_debug boot option")
