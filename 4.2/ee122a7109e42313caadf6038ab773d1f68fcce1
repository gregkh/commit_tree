KVM: x86: Fix update RCX/RDI/RSI on REP-string

When REP-string instruction is preceded with an address-size prefix,
ECX/EDI/ESI are used as the operation counter and pointers.  When they are
updated, the high 32-bits of RCX/RDI/RSI are cleared, similarly to the way they
are updated on every 32-bit register operation.  Fix it.
