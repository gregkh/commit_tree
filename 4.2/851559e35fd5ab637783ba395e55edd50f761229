perf/x86/intel: Use the PEBS auto reload mechanism when possible

When a fixed period is specified, this patch makes perf use the PEBS
auto reload mechanism. This makes normal profiling faster, because
it avoids one costly MSR write in the PMI handler.

However, the reset value will be loaded by hardware assist. There is a
small delay compared to the previous non-auto-reload mechanism. The
delay time is arbitrary, but very small. The assist cost is 400-800
cycles, assuming common cases with everything cached. The minimum period
the patch currently uses is 10000. In that extreme case it can be ~10%
if cycles are used.
