arm64: psci: remove unnecessary id indirection

PSCI 0.1 did not define canonical IDs for CPU_ON, CPU_OFF, CPU_SUSPEND,
or MIGRATE, and so these need to be provided when using firmware
compliant to PSCI 0.1.

However, functions introduced in 0.2 or later have canonical IDs, and
these cannot be provided via DT. There's no need to indirect the IDs via
a table; they can be used directly at callsites (and already are for
SYSTEM_OFF and SYSTEM_RESET).

This patch removes the unnecessary function ID indirection for
AFFINITY_INFO and MIGRATE_INFO_TYPE.
