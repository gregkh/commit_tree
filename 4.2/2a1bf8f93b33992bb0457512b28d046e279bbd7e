lib/scatterlist: mark input buffer parameters as 'const'

The 'buf' parameter of sg(p)copy_from_buffer() can and should be
const-qualified, although because of the shared implementation of
_to_buffer() and _from_buffer(), we have to cast this away internally.

This means that callers who have a 'const' buffer containing the data to
be copied to the sg-list no longer have to cast away the const-ness
themselves.  It also enables improved coverage by code analysis tools.
