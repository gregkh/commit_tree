power_supply: max17042: Add OF support for setting thresholds

The commit edd4ab055931 ("power: max17042_battery: add HEALTH and TEMP_*
properties support") added support for setting voltage and temperature
thresholds with platform data. For DeviceTree default of 0 was always
used.

This caused reporting battery health always as over voltage or
over heated.
