btrfs: qgroup: Add function qgroup_update_counters().

Add function qgroup_update_counters(), which will update related
qgroups' rfer/excl according to old/new_roots.

This is one of the two core functions for the new qgroup implement.

This is based on btrfs_adjust_coutners() but with clearer logic and
comment.
