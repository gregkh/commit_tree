Btrfs: fix necessary chunk tree space calculation when allocating a chunk

When allocating a new chunk or removing one we need to update num_devs
device items and insert or remove a chunk item in the chunk tree, so
in the worst case the space needed in the chunk space_info is:

  btrfs_calc_trunc_metadata_size(chunk_root, num_devs) +
     btrfs_calc_trans_metadata_size(chunk_root, 1)

That is, in the worst case we need to cow num_devs paths and cow 1 other
path that can result in splitting every node and leaf, and each path
consisting of BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL - 1 nodes and 1 leaf. We were requiring
some additional chunk_root->nodesize * BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL * num_devs bytes,
which were unnecessary since updating the existing device items does
not result in splitting the nodes and leaf since after updating them
they remain with the same size.
