net/mlx5e: Static mapping of netdev priv resources to/from netdev TX queues

To save per-packet calculations, we use the following static mappings:
1) priv {channel, tc} to netdev txq (used @mlx5e_selec_queue())
2) netdev txq to priv sq (used @mlx5e_xmit())

Thanks to these static mappings, no more need for a separate implementation
of ndo_start_xmit when multiple TCs are configured.
We believe the performance improvement of such separation would be negligible, if any.
The previous way of dynamically calculating the above mappings required
allocating more TX queues than actually used (@alloc_etherdev_mqs()),
which is now no longer needed.
