netfilter: x_tables: remove XT_TABLE_INFO_SZ and a dereference.

After Florian patches, there is no need for XT_TABLE_INFO_SZ anymore :
Only one copy of table is kept, instead of one copy per cpu.

We also can avoid a dereference if we put table data right after
xt_table_info. It reduces register pressure and helps compiler.

Then, we attempt a kmalloc() if total size is under order-3 allocation,
to reduce TLB pressure, as in many cases, rules fit in 32 KB.
