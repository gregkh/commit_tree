ACPICA: Divergence: Remove redundant definitions.

There are two same "define"s in the actypes.h for ACPI_USE_NATIVE_DIVIDE,
this patch removes one of them as it is useless and is not in the ACPICA
upstream. It is likely that the useless block is there because of the
issues in the old ACPICA release process.
