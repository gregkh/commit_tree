selinux: fix setting of security labels on NFS

Before calling into the filesystem, vfs_setxattr calls
security_inode_setxattr, which ends up calling selinux_inode_setxattr in
our case.  That returns -EOPNOTSUPP whenever SBLABEL_MNT is not set.
SBLABEL_MNT was supposed to be set by sb_finish_set_opts, which sets it
only if selinux_is_sblabel_mnt returns true.

The selinux_is_sblabel_mnt logic was broken by eadcabc697e9 "SELinux: do
all flags twiddling in one place", which didn't take into the account
the SECURITY_FS_USE_NATIVE behavior that had been introduced for nfs
with eb9ae686507b "SELinux: Add new labeling type native labels".

This caused setxattr's of security labels over NFSv4.2 to fail.
