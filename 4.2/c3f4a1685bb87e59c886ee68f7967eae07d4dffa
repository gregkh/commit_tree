Btrfs: use kmem_cache_free when freeing entry in inode cache

The free space entries are allocated using kmem_cache_zalloc(),
through __btrfs_add_free_space(), therefore we should use
kmem_cache_free() and not kfree() to avoid any confusion and
any potential problem. Looking at the kfree() definition at
mm/slab.c it has the following comment:

  /*
   * (...)
   *
   * Don't free memory not originally allocated by kmalloc()
   * or you will run into trouble.
   */

So better be safe and use kmem_cache_free().
