cpu: Handle smpboot_unpark_threads() uniformly

Commit 00df35f99191 (cpu: Defer smpboot kthread unparking until CPU known
to scheduler) put the online path's call to smpboot_unpark_threads()
into a CPU-hotplug notifier.  This commit places the offline-failure
paths call into the same notifier for the sake of uniformity.

Note that it is not currently possible to place the offline path's call to
smpboot_park_threads() into an existing notifier because the CPU_DYING
notifiers run in a restricted environment, and the CPU_UP_PREPARE
notifiers run too soon.
