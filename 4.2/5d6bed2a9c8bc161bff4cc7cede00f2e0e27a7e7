ARM: dove: fix legacy dove IRQ numbers

v3.18 changed handle_IRQ() to call __handle_domain_irq(), which now
rejects attempts to deliver IRQ0.  Since IRQ 0 is used as the timer
interrupt (just like the PIT on x86), this causes boot to fail as the
bogomips calibration never completes.

Fix this by shuffling all interrupts up by one.
