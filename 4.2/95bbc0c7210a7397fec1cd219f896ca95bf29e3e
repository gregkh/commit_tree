mm: rename RECLAIM_SWAP to RECLAIM_UNMAP

The name SWAP implies that we are dealing with anonymous pages only.  In
fact, the original patch that introduced the min_unmapped_ratio logic
was to fix an issue related to file pages.  Rename it to RECLAIM_UNMAP
to match what does.

Historically, commit a6dc60f8975a ("vmscan: rename sc.may_swap to
may_unmap") renamed .may_swap to .may_unmap, leaving RECLAIM_SWAP
behind.  commit 2e2e42598908 ("vmscan,memcg: reintroduce sc->may_swap")
reintroduced .may_swap for memory controller.
