gpio: sysfs: fix race between gpiod export and unexport

Make sure to deregister the class device (and release the irq) while
holding the sysfs lock in gpio_unexport to prevent racing with
gpio_export.

Note that this requires the recently introduced per-gpio locking to
avoid a deadlock with the kernfs active protection when waiting for the
attribute operations to drain during deregistration.
