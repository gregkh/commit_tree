xen/gntdevt: Fix race condition in gntdev_release()

While gntdev_release() is called the MMU notifier is still registered
and can traverse priv->maps list even if no pages are mapped (which is
the case -- gntdev_release() is called after all). But
gntdev_release() will clear that list, so make sure that only one of
those things happens at the same time.
