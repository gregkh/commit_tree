qmi_wwan: add the second QMI/network interface for Sierra Wireless MC7305/MC7355

Sierra Wireless MC7305/MC7355 with USB ID 1199:9041 also provide a
second QMI/network interface like the MC73xx with USB ID 1199:68c0 on
USB interface #10 when used in the appropriate USB configuration.
Add the corresponding QMI_FIXED_INTF entry to the qmi_wwan driver.

Please note that the second QMI/network interface is not working for
early MC73xx firmware versions like 01.08.x as the device does not
respond to QMI messages on the second /dev/cdc-wdm port.
