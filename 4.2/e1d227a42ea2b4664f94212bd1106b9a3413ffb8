btrfs: Handle unaligned length in extent_same

The extent-same code rejects requests with an unaligned length. This
poses a problem when we want to dedupe the tail extent of files as we
skip cloning the portion between i_size and the extent boundary.

If we don't clone the entire extent, it won't be deleted. So the
combination of these behaviors winds up giving us worst-case dedupe on
many files.

We can fix this by allowing a length that extents to i_size and
internally aligining those to the end of the block. This is what
btrfs_ioctl_clone() so we can just copy that check over.
