block: Do a full clone when splitting discard bios

This fixes a data corruption bug when using discard on top of MD linear,
raid0 and raid10 personalities.

Commit 20d0189b1012 "block: Introduce new bio_split()" permits sharing
the bio_vec between the two resulting bios. That is fine for read/write
requests where the bio_vec is immutable. For discards, however, we need
to be able to attach a payload and update the bio_vec so the page can
get mapped to a scatterlist entry. Therefore the bio_vec can not be
shared when splitting discards and we must do a full clone.
