ACPI / video: Add a parameter to not register the backlight sysfs interface

On some systems acpi-video backlight is broken in the sense that it cannot
control the brightness of the backlight, but it must still be called on
resume to power-up the backlight after resume.

This commit allows these systems to work by going through all the usual
backlight control moves, while not registering a sysfs backlight
interface.

This commit also adds a quirk enabling this parameter on Toshiba Portege
R830 systems which are known to be affected by this.

I wish there was a better way to deal with this, but we've been unable to
find one.
