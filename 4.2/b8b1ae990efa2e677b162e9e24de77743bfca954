cxgb4: Pass in a Congestion Channel Map to t4_sge_alloc_rxq()

Passes a Congestion Channel Map to t4_sge_alloc_rxq()
for the Ethernet RX Queues based on the MPS Buffer Group Map
of the TX Channel rather than just the TX Channel Map.
Also, in t4_sge_alloc_rxq() for T5, setting up the
Congestion Manager values of the new RX Ethernet Queue is
done by firmware now.
