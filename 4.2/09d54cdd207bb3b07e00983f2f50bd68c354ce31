f2fs: setting discard option in parse_options()

For the first mount of f2fs image with realtime discard option, we will
disable discard option if device is not supported, but for remount
operation, our discard option can still be set, this should be avoided.

This patch moves configuring of discard option to parse_options() to fix
this issue.
