rcu: Provide diagnostic option to slow down grace-period scans

Grace-period scans of the rcu_node combining tree normally
proceed quite quickly, so that it is very difficult to reproduce
races against them.  This commit therefore allows grace-period
pre-initialization and cleanup to be artificially slowed down,
increasing race-reproduction probability.  A pair of pairs of new
Kconfig parameters are provided, RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_PREINIT to
enable the slowing down of propagating CPU-hotplug changes up the
combining tree along with RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_PREINIT_DELAY to
specify the delay in jiffies, and RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_CLEANUP
to enable the slowing down of the end-of-grace-period cleanup scan
along with RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_CLEANUP_DELAY to specify the delay
in jiffies.  Boot-time parameters named rcutree.gp_preinit_delay and
rcutree.gp_cleanup_delay allow these delays to be specified at boot time.
