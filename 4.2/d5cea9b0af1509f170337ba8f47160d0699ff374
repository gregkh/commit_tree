x86/fpu: Rename fpu->has_fpu to fpu->fpregs_active

So the current code uses fpu->has_cpu to determine whether a given
user FPU context is actively loaded into the FPU's registers [*] and
that those registers represent the task's current FPU state.

But this term is not unambiguous: especially the distinction between
fpu->has_fpu, PF_USED_MATH and fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx is not clear.

Increase clarity by unambigously signalling that it's about
hardware registers being active right now, by renaming it to
fpu->fpregs_active.

( In later patches we'll use more of the 'fpregs' naming, which will
  make it easier to grep for as well. )

[*] There's the kernel_fpu_begin()/end() primitive that also
    activates FPU hw registers as well and uses them, without
    touching the fpu->fpregs_active flag.
