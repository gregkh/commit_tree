tile: modify arch_spin_unlock_wait() semantics

Rather than trying to wait until all possible lockers have
unlocked the lock, we now only wait until the current locker
(if any) has released the lock.

The old code was correct, but the new code works more like the x86
code and thus hopefully is more appropriate under contention.
See commit 78bff1c8684f ("x86/ticketlock: Fix spin_unlock_wait()
livelock") for x86.
