drm/qxl: Simplify cleaning qxl processing command

In qxlhw_handle_to_bo we incremented counters twice, one time for release object
and one for reloc_info.
In the main function however reloc_info references was drop much earlier than
release so keeping the pointer only on release is safe and make cleaning
process easier.
