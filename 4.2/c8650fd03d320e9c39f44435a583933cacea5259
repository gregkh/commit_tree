NTB: Fix transport stats for multiple devices

Currently the debugfs does not have files for all NTB transport queue
pairs.  When there are multiple NTBs present in a system, the QP names
of the last transport clobber the names of previously added transport
QPs.  Only the last added QPs can be observed via debugfs.

Create a directory per NTB transport to associate the QPs with that
transport.  Name the directory the same as the PCI device.
