ipv6: Set FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH at flowi6_flags

The neighbor look-up used to depend on the rt6i_gateway (if
there is a gateway) or the rt6i_dst (if it is a RTF_CACHE clone)
as the nexthop address.  Note that rt6i_dst is set to fl6->daddr
for the RTF_CACHE clone where fl6->daddr is the one used to do
the route look-up.

Now, we only create RTF_CACHE clone after encountering exception.
When doing the neighbor look-up with a route that is neither a gateway
nor a RTF_CACHE clone, the daddr in skb will be used as the nexthop.

In some cases, the daddr in skb is not the one used to do
the route look-up.  One example is in ip_vs_dr_xmit_v6() where the
real nexthop server address is different from the one in the skb.

This patch is going to follow the IPv4 approach and ask the
ip6_pol_route() callers to set the FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH properly.

In the next patch, ip6_pol_route() will honor the FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH
and create a RTF_CACHE clone.
