mailbox/bcm2835: Fix mailbox full detection.

With the VC reader blocked and the ARM writing, MAIL0_STA reads empty
permanently while MAIL1_STA goes from empty (0x40000000) to non-empty
(0x00000001-0x00000007) to full (0x80000008).

This bug ended up having no effect on us, because all of our
transactions in the client driver were synchronous and under a mutex.
