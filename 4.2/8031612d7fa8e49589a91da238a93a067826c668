bnx2x: fix DMA API usage

With CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG=y bnx2x triggers the error "DMA-API: device
driver frees DMA memory with wrong function".
On archs where PAGE_SIZE > SGE_PAGE_SIZE it also triggers "DMA-API:
device driver frees DMA memory with different size".

Fix this by making the mapping and unmapping symmetric:
 - Do not map the whole pool page at once. Instead map the
   SGE_PAGE_SIZE-sized pieces individually, so they can be unmapped in
   the same manner.
 - What's mapped using dma_map_page() must be unmapped using
   dma_unmap_page().

Tested on ppc64.
