qla2xxx: cleanup cmd in qla workqueue before processing TMR

Since cmds go into qla_tgt_wq and TMRs don't, it's possible that TMR
like TASK_ABORT can be queued over the cmd for which it was meant.
To avoid this race, use a per-port list to keep track of cmds that
are enqueued to qla_tgt_wq but not yet processed. When a TMR arrives,
iterate through this list and remove any cmds that match the TMR.
This patch supports TASK_ABORT and LUN_RESET.
