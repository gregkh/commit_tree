arm64: KVM: Switch vgic save/restore to alternative_insn

So far, we configured the world-switch by having a small array
of pointers to the save and restore functions, depending on the
GIC used on the platform.

Loading these values each time is a bit silly (they never change),
and it makes sense to rely on the instruction patching instead.

This leads to a nice cleanup of the code.
