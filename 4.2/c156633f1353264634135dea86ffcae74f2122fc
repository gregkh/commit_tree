Renesas Ethernet AVB driver proper

Ethernet AVB includes an Gigabit Ethernet controller (E-MAC) that is basically
compatible with SuperH Gigabit Ethernet E-MAC.  Ethernet AVB has  a  dedicated
direct memory access controller (AVB-DMAC) that is a new design compared to the
SuperH E-DMAC. The AVB-DMAC is compliant with 3 standards formulated for IEEE
802.1BA: IEEE 802.1AS timing and synchronization protocol, IEEE 802.1Qav real-
time transfer, and the IEEE 802.1Qat stream reservation protocol.

The  driver only supports device tree probing, so the binding document is
included in this patch.
