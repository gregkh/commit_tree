staging: comedi: das08: remove board register map comments

The "das08" module contains some comments outlining the register maps
for some of the ISA boards supported by this module in combination with
the "das08_isa" module.  The comments are somewhat sporadically placed,
don't detail all the boards, and don't use the preferred block comment
style.  If anywhere, they should probably be in the "das08_isa" module.
Just remove them.  The comments for the register macros indicate which
boards they apply to anyway, so we don't lose much information.
