IB: Add rdma_cap_ib_switch helper and use where appropriate

Persuant to Liran's comments on node_type on linux-rdma
mailing list:

In an effort to reform the RDMA core and ULPs to minimize use of
node_type in struct ib_device, an additional bit is added to
struct ib_device for is_switch (IB switch). This is needed
to be initialized by any IB switch device driver. This is a
NEW requirement on such device drivers which are all
"out of tree".

In addition, an ib_switch helper was added to ib_verbs.h
based on the is_switch device bit rather than node_type
(although those should be consistent).

The RDMA core (MAD, SMI, agent, sa_query, multicast, sysfs)
as well as (IPoIB and SRP) ULPs are updated where
appropriate to use this new helper. In some cases,
the helper is now used under the covers of using
rdma_[start end]_port rather than the open coding
previously used.
