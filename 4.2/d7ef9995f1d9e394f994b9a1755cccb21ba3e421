iommu: Init iommu-groups support earlier, in core_initcall

iommu_group_alloc might be called very early in case of iommu controllers
activated from of_iommu, so ensure that this part of subsystem is ready
when devices are being populated from device-tree (core_initcall seems to
be okay for this case).
