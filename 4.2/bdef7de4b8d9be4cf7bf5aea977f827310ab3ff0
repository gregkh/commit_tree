net: Add priority to packet_offload objects.

When we scan a packet for GRO processing, we want to see the most
common packet types in the front of the offload_base list.

So add a priority field so we can handle this properly.

IPv4/IPv6 get the highest priority with the implicit zero priority
field.

Next comes ethernet with a priority of 10, and then we have the MPLS
types with a priority of 15.
