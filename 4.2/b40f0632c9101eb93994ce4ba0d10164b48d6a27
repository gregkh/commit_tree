MAINTAINERS: Extend Samsung MFD drivers entry and add Krzysztof Kozlowski

Extend the entry for Samsung MFD drivers for PMIC devices (Power
Management Integrated Circuit) with bindings documentation, clock
(clk-s2mps11.c) and RTC drivers (rtc-s5m.c).

These PMIC devices are used on many Exynos-based boards like Arndale
Octa (S2MPS11), Gear 2 (S2MPS14).

Add Krzysztof Kozlowski as a supporter for reviewing them.
I am not the author of these drivers. However I have recently
contributed to most of them and I have access to datasheets and hardware.
