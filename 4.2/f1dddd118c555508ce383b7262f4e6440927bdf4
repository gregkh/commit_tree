xen/arm: allow console=hvc0 to be omitted for guests

From: Ard Biesheuvel <ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>

This patch registers hvc0 as the preferred console if no console
has been specified explicitly on the kernel command line.

The purpose is to allow platform agnostic kernels and boot images
(such as distro installers) to boot in a Xen/ARM domU without the
need to modify the command line by hand.
