mlx4: Disable HA for SRIOV PF RoCE devices

When in HA mode, the driver exposes an IB (RoCE) device instance with only
one port. Under SRIOV, the existing implementation doesn't go well with
the PF RoCE driver's role of Special QPs Para-Virtualization, etc.

As such, disable HA for the mlx4 PF RoCE device in SRIOV mode.
