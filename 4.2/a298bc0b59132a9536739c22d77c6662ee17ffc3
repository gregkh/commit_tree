staging: unisys: Convert device creation to use visor_device

This patch removes the legacy dev_info struct and instead creates
and passes around a traditional struct device.

This allows us to remove a lot of the various look up code and
removes the doubt if the struct exists or not.

Half of the churn is just the conversion of visorchipset_device_info
to visor_device.  Various cleanups include re-arranging the failure
paths to make more sense.

Pay attention to the create_visor_device function.  This had a lot of
churn to simplify everything.

Lots of functions disappeared because they are not needed any more.
