brcmfmac: fix sdio suspend and resume

commit 330b4e4be937 ("brcmfmac: Add wowl support for SDIO devices.")
changed the behaviour by removing the MMC_PM_KEEP_POWER flag for
non-wowl scenario, which needs to be restored. Another necessary
change is to mark the card as being non-removable. With this in place
the suspend resume test passes successfully doing:

 # echo devices > /sys/power/pm_test
 # echo mem > /sys/power/state

Note that power may still be switched off when system is going
in S3 state.
