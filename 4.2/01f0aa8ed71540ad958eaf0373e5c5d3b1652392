mips/ath25: remove legacy __cpuinit section that crept in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time ago.
However this one crept back in as of commit 43cc739fd98b8c517ad45756d869f
("MIPS: ath25: add common parts")

Since we want to clobber the stubs soon, get this removed now.
