drm/msm/adreno: dump scratch regs and other info on hang

Dump a bit more info when the GPU hangs, without having hang_debug
enabled (which dumps a *lot* of registers).  Also dump the scratch
registers, as they are useful for determining where in the cmdstream
the GPU hung (and they seem always safe to read when GPU has hung).

Note that the freedreno gallium driver emits increasing counter values
to SCRATCH6 (to identify tile #) and SCRATCH7 (to identify draw #), so
these two in particular can be used to "triangulate" where in the
cmdstream the GPU hung.
