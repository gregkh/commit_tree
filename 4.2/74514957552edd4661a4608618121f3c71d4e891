bonding: Allow userspace to set actors' macaddr in an AD-system.

In an AD system, the communication between actor and partner is the
business between these two entities. In the current setup anyone on the
same L2 can "guess" the LACPDU contents and then possibly send the
spoofed LACPDUs and trick the partner causing connectivity issues for
the AD system. This patch allows to use a random mac-address obscuring
it's identity making it harder for someone in the L2 is do the same thing.

This patch allows user-space to choose the mac-address for the AD-system.
This mac-address can not be NULL or a Multicast. If the mac-address is set
from user-space; kernel will honor it and will not overwrite it. In the
absence (value from user space); the logic will default to using the
masters' mac as the mac-address for the AD-system.

It can be set using example code below -

   # modprobe bonding mode=4
   # sys_mac_addr=$(printf '%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x' \
                    $(( (RANDOM & 0xFE) | 0x02 )) \
                    $(( RANDOM & 0xFF )) \
                    $(( RANDOM & 0xFF )) \
                    $(( RANDOM & 0xFF )) \
                    $(( RANDOM & 0xFF )) \
                    $(( RANDOM & 0xFF )))
   # echo $sys_mac_addr > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/ad_actor_system
   # echo +eth1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
   ...
   # ip link set bond0 up
