vfio: powerpc/spapr: Support Dynamic DMA windows

This adds create/remove window ioctls to create and remove DMA windows.
sPAPR defines a Dynamic DMA windows capability which allows
para-virtualized guests to create additional DMA windows on a PCI bus.
The existing linux kernels use this new window to map the entire guest
memory and switch to the direct DMA operations saving time on map/unmap
requests which would normally happen in a big amounts.

This adds 2 ioctl handlers - VFIO_IOMMU_SPAPR_TCE_CREATE and
VFIO_IOMMU_SPAPR_TCE_REMOVE - to create and remove windows.
Up to 2 windows are supported now by the hardware and by this driver.

This changes VFIO_IOMMU_SPAPR_TCE_GET_INFO handler to return additional
information such as a number of supported windows and maximum number
levels of TCE tables.

DDW is added as a capability, not as a SPAPR TCE IOMMU v2 unique feature
as we still want to support v2 on platforms which cannot do DDW for
the sake of TCE acceleration in KVM (coming soon).
