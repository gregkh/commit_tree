staging: unisys: Add a function to set the clientpartition

This patch is an attempt to help hide the channel info behind
accessory functions.  I was trying to keep visorchannel as private
as possible.

The only function missing that seemed to be needed for now was
the ability to set the clientpartition.  So I expose that here.
