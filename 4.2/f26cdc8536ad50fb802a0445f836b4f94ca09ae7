blk-mq: Shared tag enhancements

Storage controllers may expose multiple block devices that share hardware
resources managed by blk-mq. This patch enhances the shared tags so a
low-level driver can access the shared resources not tied to the unshared
h/w contexts. This way the LLD can dynamically add and delete disks and
request queues without having to track all the request_queue hctx's to
iterate outstanding tags.
