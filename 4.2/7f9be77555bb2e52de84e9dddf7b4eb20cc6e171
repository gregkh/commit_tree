s390/hugetlb: add hugepages_supported define

On s390 we only can enable hugepages if the underlying hardware/hypervisor
also does support this.  Common code now would assume this to be
signaled by setting HPAGE_SHIFT to 0.  But on s390, where we only
support one hugepage size, there is a link between HPAGE_SHIFT and
pageblock_order.

So instead of setting HPAGE_SHIFT to 0, we will implement the check for
the hardware capability.
