packet: free packet_rollover after synchronize_net

Destruction of the po->rollover must be delayed until there are no
more packets in flight that can access it. The field is destroyed in
packet_release, before synchronize_net. Delay using rcu.

Fixes: 0648ab70afe6 ("packet: rollover prepare: per-socket state")
