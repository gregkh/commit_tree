MIPS: BCM47xx: Simplify handling SPROM revisions

After the big SPROM cleanup moving code to the bcm47xx_sprom_fill_auto
we ended up with few tiny functions, two of them being identical. Let's
get rid of these [12]-liners.
This also stops extracting higher SPROM revisions as revision 1. Now we
have that function nicely handling revisions we don't need it.
