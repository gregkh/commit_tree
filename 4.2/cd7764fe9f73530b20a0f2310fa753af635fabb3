KVM: x86: latch INITs while in system management mode

Do not process INITs immediately while in system management mode, keep
it instead in apic->pending_events.  Tell userspace if an INIT is
pending when they issue GET_VCPU_EVENTS, and similarly handle the
new field in SET_VCPU_EVENTS.

Note that the same treatment should be done while in VMX non-root mode.
