drm/i915: Remove _entry from PPGTT page structures

Lets try to keep this consistent:

Page Directory Pointer (PDP).
Page Directory (PD), also known as page directory pointer entries.
Page Table (PT), also known as page directory entries.

s/struct i915_page_table_entry/struct i915_page_table/
s/struct i915_page_directory_entry/struct i915_page_directory/
s/struct i915_page_directory_pointer_entry/struct
i915_page_directory_pointer/
