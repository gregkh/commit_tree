libnvdimm: pmem label sets and namespace instantiation.

A complete label set is a PMEM-label per-dimm per-interleave-set where
all the UUIDs match and the interleave set cookie matches the hosting
interleave set.

Present sysfs attributes for manipulation of a PMEM-namespace's
'alt_name', 'uuid', and 'size' attributes.  A later patch will make
these settings persistent by writing back the label.

Note that PMEM allocations grow forwards from the start of an interleave
set (lowest dimm-physical-address (DPA)).  BLK-namespaces that alias
with a PMEM interleave set will grow allocations backward from the
highest DPA.
