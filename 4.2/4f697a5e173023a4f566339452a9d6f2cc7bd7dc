namei: simpler treatment of symlinks with nothing other that / in the body

Instead of saving name and branching to OK:, where we'll immediately restore
it, and call walk_component() with WALK_PUT|WALK_GET and nd->last_type being
LAST_BIND, which is equivalent to put_link(nd), err = 0, we can just treat
that the same way we'd treat procfs-style "jump" symlinks - do put_link(nd)
and move on.
