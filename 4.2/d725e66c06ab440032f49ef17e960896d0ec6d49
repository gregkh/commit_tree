Revert "fsnotify: fix oops in fsnotify_clear_marks_by_group_flags()"

This reverts commit a2673b6e040663bf16a552f8619e6bde9f4b9acf.

Kinglong Mee reports a memory leak with that patch, and Jan Kara confirms:

 "Thanks for report! You are right that my patch introduces a race
  between fsnotify kthread and fsnotify_destroy_group() which can result
  in leaking inotify event on group destruction.

  I haven't yet decided whether the right fix is not to queue events for
  dying notification group (as that is pointless anyway) or whether we
  should just fix the original problem differently...  Whenever I look
  at fsnotify code mark handling I get lost in the maze of locks, lists,
  and subtle differences between how different notification systems
  handle notification marks :( I'll think about it over night"

and after thinking about it, Jan says:

 "OK, I have looked into the code some more and I found another
  relatively simple way of fixing the original oops.  It will be IMHO
  better than trying to fixup this issue which has more potential for
  breakage.  I'll ask Linus to revert the fsnotify fix he already merged
  and send a new fix"
