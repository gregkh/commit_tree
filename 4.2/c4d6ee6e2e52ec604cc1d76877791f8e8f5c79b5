x86/fpu: Remove failure paths from fpstate-alloc low level functions

Now that we always allocate the FPU context as part of task_struct there's
no need for separate allocations - remove them and their primary failure
handling code.

( Note that there's still secondary error codes that have become superfluous,
  those will be removed in separate patches. )

Move the somewhat misplaced setup_xstate_comp() call to the core.
