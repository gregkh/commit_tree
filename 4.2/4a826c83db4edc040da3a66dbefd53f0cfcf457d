libnvdimm: namespace indices: read and validate

This on media label format [1] consists of two index blocks followed by
an array of labels.  None of these structures are ever updated in place.
A sequence number tracks the current active index and the next one to
write, while labels are written to free slots.

    +------------+
    |            |
    |  nsindex0  |
    |            |
    +------------+
    |            |
    |  nsindex1  |
    |            |
    +------------+
    |   label0   |
    +------------+
    |   label1   |
    +------------+
    |            |
     ....nslot...
    |            |
    +------------+
    |   labelN   |
    +------------+

After reading valid labels, store the dpa ranges they claim into
per-dimm resource trees.
