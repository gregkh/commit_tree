perf tools: Introduce struct maps

That for now has the maps rbtree and the list for the dead maps, that
may be still referenced from some hist_entry, etc.

This paves the way for protecting the rbtree with a lock, then refcount
the maps and finally remove the removed_maps list, as it'll not ne
anymore needed.
