dm cache: boost promotion of blocks that will be overwritten

When considering whether to move a block to the cache we already give
preferential treatment to discarded blocks, since they are cheap to
promote (no read of the origin required since the data is junk).

The same is true of blocks that are about to be completely
overwritten, so we likewise boost their promotion chances.
