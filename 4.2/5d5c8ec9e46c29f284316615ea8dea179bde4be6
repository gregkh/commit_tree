ath10k: replenish htc tx credits always

There's always at most 2 credits and it makes
little sense to set the
ATH10K_HTC_FLAG_NEED_CREDIT_UPDATE flag
conditionally.

This seems to fix some random issues with tx
credit starvation on WLAN.RM.2.0-00073 I've been
seeing. Note: this isn't related to wmi mgmt tx.
