ACPI / video: Move backlight notifier to video_detect.c

Move the unregistering of the acpi backlight interface on registering of a
native backlight from video.c to video_detect.c where it belongs.

Note this removes support for re-registering the acpi backlight interface
when the native interface goes away. In practice this never happens and
it needlessly complicates the code.
