bridge: allow setting hash_max + multicast_router if interface is down

Network managers like netifd (used in OpenWRT for instance) try to
configure interface options after creation but before setting the
interface up.

Unfortunately the sysfs / bridge currently only allows to configure the
hash_max and multicast_router options when the bridge interface is up.
But since br_multicast_init() doesn't start any timers and only sets
default values and initializes timers it should be save to reconfigure
the default values after that, before things actually get active after
the bridge is set up.
