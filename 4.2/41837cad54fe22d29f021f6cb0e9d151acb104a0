i40e: fix unrecognized FCOE EOF case

Because i40e_fcoe_ctxt_eof should never be called without
i40e_fcoe_eof_is_supported being called first, the EOF in fcoe_ctxt_eof
should always be valid and therefore we do not need to print an error
if it is not valid.

However, a WARN ON to easily catch any calls to i40e_fcoe_ctxt_eof that
aren't preceded with a call to i40e_fcoe_eof_is_supported is helpful.
