MIPS: Fix LLVM build issue.

Matthew Fortune <Matthew.Fortune@imgtec.com> reports:

The genex.S file appears to mix the case of a macro between its definition and
use. A cut down example of this is below. The macro __build_clear_none has
lower case 'build' but ends up being instantiated with upper case BUILD. Can
this be fixed on master. It has been picked up by the LLVM integrated assembler
which is currently case sensitive. We are likely to fix the assembler as well
but the code is currently inconsistent in the kernel.

 .macro __build_clear_none
 .endm

 .macro __BUILD_HANDLER exception handler clear verbose ext
 .align 5
 .globl handle_\exception; .align 2; .type handle_\exception, @function; .ent
handle_\exception, 0; handle_\exception: .frame $29, 184, $29
 .set noat
 .globl handle_\exception\ext; .type handle_\exception\ext, @function;
handle_\exception\ext:
 __BUILD_clear_\clear
 .endm

 .macro BUILD_HANDLER exception handler clear verbose
 __BUILD_HANDLER \exception \handler \clear \verbose _int
 .endm

BUILD_HANDLER ftlb ftlb none silent
