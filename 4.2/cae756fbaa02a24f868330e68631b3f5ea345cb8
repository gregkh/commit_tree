ACPI / PCI: remove stale list_head in struct acpi_prt_entry

list_head "list" in struct acpi_prt_entry was used to connect
_PRT entries for PCI irq, but after commit 181380b702ee ("PCI/ACPI:
Don't cache _PRT, and don't associate them with bus numbers"),
the list head for _PRT entries was removed, but left "list" in
struct acpi_prt_entry which is useless and stale, remove it now.
