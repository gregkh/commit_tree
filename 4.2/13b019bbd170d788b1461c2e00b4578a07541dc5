[media] e4000: Fix rangehigh value

As reported by smatch:

drivers/media/tuners/e4000.c:287:32: warning: constant 2208000000 is so big it is long long
drivers/media/tuners/e4000.c:287:32: warning: decimal constant 2208000000 is between LONG_MAX and ULONG_MAX. For C99 that means long long, C90 compilers are very likely to produce unsigned long (and a warning) here
drivers/media/tuners/e4000.c:287:3: warning: this decimal constant is unsigned only in ISO C90
   .rangehigh  =  2208000000,
