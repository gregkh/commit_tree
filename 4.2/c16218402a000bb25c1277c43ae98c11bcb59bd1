[media] videobuf2: return -EPIPE from DQBUF after the last buffer

If the last buffer was dequeued from a capture queue, let poll return
immediately and let DQBUF return -EPIPE to signal there will no more
buffers to dequeue until STREAMOFF.
The driver signals the last buffer by setting the V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST.
To reenable dequeuing on the capture queue, the driver must explicitly
call vb2_clear_last_buffer_queued. The last buffer queued flag is
cleared automatically during STREAMOFF.
