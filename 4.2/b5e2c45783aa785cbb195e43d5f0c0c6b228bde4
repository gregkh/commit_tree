tcp: remove obsolete check in tcp_set_skb_tso_segs()

We had various issues in the past when TCP stack was modifying
gso_size/gso_segs while clones were in flight.

Commit c52e2421f73 ("tcp: must unclone packets before mangling them")
fixed these bugs and added a WARN_ON_ONCE(skb_cloned(skb)); in
tcp_set_skb_tso_segs()

These bugs are now fixed, and because TCP stack now only sets
shinfo->gso_size|segs on the clone itself, the check can be removed.

As a result of this change, compiler inlines tcp_set_skb_tso_segs() in
tcp_init_tso_segs()
