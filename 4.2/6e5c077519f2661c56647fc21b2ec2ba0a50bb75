powerpc/vdso: Combine start/size variables

In vdso_fixup_features() we have start64/start32 and size64/size32, but
they have the same types, ie. void * and unsigned long.

They're only used to save the return value from find_sectionXX() for the
subsequent call to do_feature_fixups(), so there's no overlap in their
usage either.

So we can just consolidate them into start/size and avoid the
duplication.
