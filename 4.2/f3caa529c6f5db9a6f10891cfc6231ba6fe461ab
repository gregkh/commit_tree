ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable max77802 regulator, rtc and clock drivers

The Maxim max77802 Power Management IC is used on many Exynos machines.
Besides a bunch of regulators, this chip has a Real-Time-Clock (RTC)
and 2-channel 32kHz clock outputs.

Enable the kernel config options to have the drivers for these devices
built as a module.
