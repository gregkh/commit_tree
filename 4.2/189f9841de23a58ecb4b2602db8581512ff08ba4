fs: allocate structure unconditionally in seq_open()

Since patch described below, from v2.6.15-rc1, seq_open() could use a
struct seq_file already allocated by the caller if the pointer to the
structure is stored in file->private_data before calling the function.

        [PATCH] allow callers of seq_open do allocation themselves

        Allow caller of seq_open() to kmalloc() seq_file + whatever else they
        want and set ->private_data to it.  seq_open() will then abstain from
        doing allocation itself.

As there's no more use for such feature, as it could be easily replaced by
calls to seq_open_private() (see commit 39699037a5c9 ("[FS] seq_file:
Introduce the seq_open_private()")) and seq_release_private() (see
v2.6.0-test3), support for this uncommon feature can be removed from
seq_open().
