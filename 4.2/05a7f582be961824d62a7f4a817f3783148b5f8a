net: phy: add locking to phy_read_mmd_indirect()/phy_write_mmd_indirect()

The phy layer is missing locking for the above two functions - it
has been observed that two threads (userspace and the phy worker
thread) can race, entering the bus ->write or ->read functions
simultaneously.

This causes the FEC driver to initialise a completion while another
thread is waiting on it or while the interrupt is calling complete()
on it, which causes spinlock unlock-without-lock, spinlock lockups,
and completion timeouts.
