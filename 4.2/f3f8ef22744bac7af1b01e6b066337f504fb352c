[media] dib0070: Fix indenting

The indentation on this driver were deadly broken. On lots
of places, it was using 4 spaces instead of tab to indent.
On other parts, it were using tabs.

Also, on several places, it were not even being properly aligned,
as reported by smatch:
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib0070.c:179 dib0070_set_bandwidth() warn: inconsistent indenting
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib0070.c:198 dib0070_captrim() warn: inconsistent indenting

	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib0070.c:498 dib0070_tune_digital() warn: inconsistent indenting
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib0070.c:655 dib0070_reset() warn: inconsistent indenting
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib0070.c:711 dib0070_reset() warn: curly braces intended?
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib0070.c:713 dib0070_reset() warn: inconsistent indenting

My first idea were to leave it as-is or to just touch the above.

However, this won't be fixing anything. So, as painful as it
is, let's fix indentation globally on the driver, and then
address the inconsistencies.

Hopefully, this driver doesn't have much patches, so it likely
won't conflict to any other patch during this merge window.

Besides the big size of this patch, no functional changes
were done.
