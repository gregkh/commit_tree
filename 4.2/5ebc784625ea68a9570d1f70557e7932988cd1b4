bridge: mdb: fix double add notification

Since the mdb add/del code was introduced there have been 2 br_mdb_notify
calls when doing br_mdb_add() resulting in 2 notifications on each add.

Example:
 Command: bridge mdb add dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
 Before patch:
 root@debian:~# bridge monitor all
 [MDB]dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
 [MDB]dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent

 After patch:
 root@debian:~# bridge monitor all
 [MDB]dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
