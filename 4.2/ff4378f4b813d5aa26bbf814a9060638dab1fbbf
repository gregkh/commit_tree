mfd: cros_ec: spi: Add delay for asserting CS

Some ECs need a little time for waking up before they can accept
SPI data at a high speed. This is configurable via a DT property
"google,cros-ec-spi-pre-delay".

This patch makes the cros_ec_spi driver to cause a delay before
the beginning of a SPI transaction, to make sure that the EC has
already woken up, if the property has been defined in the DTS.
