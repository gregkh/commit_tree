ARC: [axs101] support early 8250 uart

Earlycon calculates UART clock as "BASE_BAUD * 16". In case of ARC
"BASE_BAUD" is calculated dynamically in runtime, basically it is an
alias to arc_early_base_baud(), which in turn just does
"arc_base_baud/16".

8250 UART on AXS/SDP board uses 33.3MHz clock source which is set in
"arc_base_baud" with this change.

Additional compatibility string "snps,arc-sdp" is introduced as well
because there're different flavours of AXS boards but they all share the
same motherboard and so it's possible to re-use the same code for
motherbord even if CPU daughterboard changes.
