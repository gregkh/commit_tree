mac80211: Always check rates and capabilities in mesh mode

In mesh mode there is a race between establishing links and processing
rates and capabilities in beacons. This is very noticeable with slow
beacons (e.g. beacon intervals of 1s) and manifested for us as stations
using minstrel when minstrel_ht should be used. Fixed by changing
mesh_sta_info_init so that it always checks rates and such if it has not
already done so.
