serial: sirf: fix system hung on console log output

A corner case exists in the current driver. if an app opens the console
device, and before writing to console device, and there are huge kernel
ogs to print out, system will hang on
sirfsoc_uart_console_putchar:
while (rd_regl(port, ureg->sirfsoc_tx_fifo_status) &
	ufifo_st->ff_full(port->line))
	cpu_relax();
as in sirfsoc_uart_startup(), the driver assigns tx_fifo_op to 0 will stop
TX FIFO, this loop will be endless.
