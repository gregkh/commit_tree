hpsa: cleanup reset

Synchronize completion the reset with completion of outstanding commands

Extending the newly-added synchronous abort functionality,
now also synchronize resets with the completion of outstanding commands.
Rename the wait queue to reflect the fact that it's being used for both
types of waits.  Also, don't complete commands which are terminated
due to a reset operation.
