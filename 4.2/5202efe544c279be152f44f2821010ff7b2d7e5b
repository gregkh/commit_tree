coredump: use from_kuid/kgid when formatting corename

When adding __printf attribute to cn_printf, gcc reports some issues:

  fs/coredump.c:213:5: warning: format '%d' expects argument of type
  'int', but argument 3 has type 'kuid_t' [-Wformat=]
       err = cn_printf(cn, "%d", cred->uid);
       ^
  fs/coredump.c:217:5: warning: format '%d' expects argument of type
  'int', but argument 3 has type 'kgid_t' [-Wformat=]
       err = cn_printf(cn, "%d", cred->gid);
       ^

These warnings come from the fact that the value of uid/gid needs to be
extracted from the kuid_t/kgid_t structure before being used as an
integer.  More precisely, cred->uid and cred->gid need to be converted to
either user-namespace uid/gid or to init_user_ns uid/gid.

Use init_user_ns in order not to break existing ABI, and document this in
Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt.

While at it, format uid and gid values with %u instead of %d because
uid_t/__kernel_uid32_t and gid_t/__kernel_gid32_t are unsigned int.
