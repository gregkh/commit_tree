ACPI / processor: Introduce invalid_logical_cpuid()

In ACPI processor drivers, we use direct comparisons of cpu logical
id with -1 which are error prone in case logical cpuid is accidentally
assinged an error code and prevents us from returning an error-encoding
cpuid directly in some cases.

So introduce invalid_logical_cpuid() to identify cpu with invalid
logical cpu num, then it will be used to replace the direct comparisons
with -1.
