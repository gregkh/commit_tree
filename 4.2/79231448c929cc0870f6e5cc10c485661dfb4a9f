powernv/eeh: Update the EEH code to use the opal irq domain

The eeh code currently uses the old notifier method to get eeh events
from OPAL. It also contains some logic to filter opal events which has
been moved into the virtual irqchip. This patch converts the eeh code
to the new event interface which simplifies event handling.
