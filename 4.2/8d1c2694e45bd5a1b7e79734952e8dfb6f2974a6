ALSA: bebob: keep duplex streams always to keep internal multiplexer properly

Behringer FCA610 transmits packets with periodic noisy PCM samples
when receiving no streams, and generates a bit noisy sound.

ALSA BeBoB driver is programmed to establish both in/out connections
when starting streaming, then transfers packets as userspace applications
requested. This means that there's a case that one of incoming/outgoing
streams is running, to save CPU and bandwidth usage. Although, it's natural
to start transferring packets in both direction.

This commit makes this driver to keeps duplex streams always.
