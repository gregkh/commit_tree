can: janz-ican3: add support for CAL/CANopen firmware

In our department we are using some older Janz ICAN3-modules in our dekstop
pcs. There we have slightly different carrier boards than the janz-cmodio
supported in the kernel sources, called CAN-PCI2 with two submodules. But the
pci configuration regions are identical. So extending the supported pci devices
to the corresponding device ids is sufficient to get the drivers working.

* The old ICAN3-modules with firmware 1.28 need more then 250ms for the restart
  after reset. I've increased the timeout to 500ms.
* The janz_ican3 module uses the raw can services of the Janz-firmware, this
  means firmware must be ICANOS/2. Our ICAN3-modules are equipped with
  CAL/CANopen-firmware, so I must use the appropriate commands for the layer
  management services.

Te driver detects the firmware after module reset and selects the commands
matching the firmware. This affects the bus on/off-command
(ican3_set_bus_state) and the configuration of the bittiming
(ican3_set_bittiming). For better diagnostics the detected firmware string is
presented as sysfs attribute (fwinfo).
