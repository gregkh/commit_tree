wil6210: reorder init sequence

Need to reorder init sequence to run wil_platform_init
before pci_enable_device. Assumption is platform init
may be required before device may be enabled.
Another issue, platform uninit should be called after
pci_disable_device because platform uninit may render
pci device non-accessible.
