[media] saa717x: fix multi-byte read code

As reported by smatch:
	drivers/media/i2c/saa717x.c:155 saa717x_read() warn: mask and shift to zero
	drivers/media/i2c/saa717x.c:155 saa717x_read() warn: mask and shift to zero

This is done right at saa717x_write(), but the read function is
broken. Thankfully, there's just one place at saa717x driver that
uses multibyte read (for status report, via printk).

Yet, let's fix it. From saa717x_write(), it is clear that the
bytes are in little endian:
		mm1[4] = (value >> 16) & 0xff;
		mm1[3] = (value >> 8) & 0xff;
		mm1[2] = value & 0xff;

So, the same order should be valid for read too.

Compile-tested only.
