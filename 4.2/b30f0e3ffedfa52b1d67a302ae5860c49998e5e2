sched/preempt: Optimize preemption operations on __schedule() callers

__schedule() disables preemption and some of its callers
(the preempt_schedule*() family) also set PREEMPT_ACTIVE.

So we have two preempt_count() modifications that could be performed
at once.

Lets remove the preemption disablement from __schedule() and pull
this responsibility to its callers in order to optimize preempt_count()
operations in a single place.
