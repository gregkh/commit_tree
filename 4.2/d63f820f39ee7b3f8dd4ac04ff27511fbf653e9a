drm/i915: Remove unnecessary null check in execlists_context_unqueue

commit 53292cdb066950611e5bc2e0eb109c7edb42af78 ("drm/i915: Workaround
to avoid lite restore with HEAD==TAIL") added a check for req0 != null
which is unnecessary.

The only way req0 could be null is if the list was empty, and this is
already addressed at the beginning of execlists_context_unqueue().
