netfilter: bridge: neigh_head and physoutdev can't be used at same time

The neigh_header is only needed when we detect DNAT after prerouting
and neigh cache didn't have a mac address for us.

The output port has not been chosen yet so we can re-use the storage
area, bringing struct size down to 32 bytes on x86_64.
