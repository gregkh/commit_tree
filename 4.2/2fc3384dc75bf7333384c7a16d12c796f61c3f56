cpufreq: Initialize policy->kobj while allocating policy

policy->kobj is required to be initialized once in the lifetime of a
policy.  Currently we are initializing it from __cpufreq_add_dev() and
that doesn't look to be the best place for doing so as we have to do
this on special cases (like: !recover_policy).

We can initialize it from a more obvious place cpufreq_policy_alloc()
and that will make code look cleaner, specially the error handling part.

The error handling part of __cpufreq_add_dev() was doing almost the same
thing while recover_policy is true or false. Fix that as well by always
calling cpufreq_policy_put_kobj() with an additional parameter to skip
notification part of it.
