clk: stm32: Fix out-by-one error path in the index lookup

If stm32f4_rcc_lookup() is called with primary == 0 and secondary == 192
then it will read beyond the end of the table array due to an out-by-one
error in the range check.

In addition to the fixing the inequality we also modify the r.h.s. to
make it even more explicit that we are comparing against the size of
table in bits.
