tcp: suppress a division by zero warning

Andrew Morton reported following warning on one ARM build
with gcc-4.4 :

net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c: In function 'inet_ehash_locks_alloc':
net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c:617: warning: division by zero

Even guarded with a test on sizeof(spinlock_t), compiler does not
like current construct on a !CONFIG_SMP build.

Remove the warning by using a temporary variable.
