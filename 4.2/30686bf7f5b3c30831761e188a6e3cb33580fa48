mac80211: convert HW flags to unsigned long bitmap

As we're running out of hardware capability flags pretty quickly,
convert them to use the regular test_bit() style unsigned long
bitmaps.

This introduces a number of helper functions/macros to set and to
test the bits, along with new debugfs code.

The occurrences of an explicit __clear_bit() are intentional, the
drivers were never supposed to change their supported bits on the
fly. We should investigate changing this to be a per-frame flag.
