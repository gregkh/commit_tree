seccomp, filter: add and use bpf_prog_create_from_user from seccomp

Seccomp has always been a special candidate when it comes to preparation
of its filters in seccomp_prepare_filter(). Due to the extra checks and
filter rewrite it partially duplicates code and has BPF internals exposed.

This patch adds a generic API inside the BPF code code that seccomp can use
and thus keep it's filter preparation code minimal and better maintainable.
The other side-effect is that now classic JITs can add seccomp support as
well by only providing a BPF_LDX | BPF_W | BPF_ABS translation.

Tested with seccomp and BPF test suites.
