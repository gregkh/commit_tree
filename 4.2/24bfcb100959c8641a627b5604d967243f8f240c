timer: Fix hotplug regression

The recent timer wheel rework removed the get/put_cpu_var() pair in
the hotplug migration code, which results in:

BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: hib.sh/2845
...
[<ffffffff810d4fa3>] timer_cpu_notify+0x53/0x12

That hunk is a leftover from an earlier iteration and went unnoticed
so far.

Restore the previous code which was obviously correct.
