zram: cut trailing newline in algorithm name

Supplied sysfs values sometimes contain new-line symbols (echo vs.  echo
-n), which we also copy as a compression algorithm name.  it works fine
when we lookup for compression algorithm, because we use sysfs_streq()
which takes care of new line symbols.  however, it doesn't look nice when
we print compression algorithm name if zcomp_create() failed:

 zram: Cannot initialise LXZ
            compressing backend

cut trailing new-line, so the error string will look like

  zram: Cannot initialise LXZ compressing backend

we also now can replace sysfs_streq() in zcomp_available_show() with
strcmp().
