ARC: entry.S: micro-optimize Trap handler

Elide the need to re-read ECR in Trap handler by ensuring that
EXCEPTION_PROLOGUE does that at the very end just before returning
to Trap handler

ARCv2 EXCEPTION_PROLOGUE already did that, so same for ARcompact and the
common trap handler adjusted to use cached ECR
