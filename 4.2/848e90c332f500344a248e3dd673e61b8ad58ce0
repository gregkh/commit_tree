Staging: lustre: ptlrpc: lproc_ptlrpc: remove unneeded null test before free

Kfree can cope with a null argument, so drop null tests.

The semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@ expression ptr; @@

- if (ptr != NULL)
  kfree(ptr);
// </smpl>

In the first case, the only cleanup needed is the unlock, so jump to that
directly.

Likewise, in the first two failure cases of ptlrpc_lprocfs_nrs_seq_write,
no cleanup is needed, so just drop the goto and return directly.
