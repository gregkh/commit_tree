netfilter: nf_queue: Don't recompute the hook_list head

If someone sends packets from one of the netdevice ingress hooks to
the a userspace queue, and then userspace later accepts the packet,
the netfilter code can enter an infinite loop as the list head will
never be found.

Pass in the saved list_head to avoid this.
