crypto: talitos - Add a feature to tag SEC1

We add a new feature in the features field, to mark compatible
"fsl,sec1.0"
We also define a helper function called has_ftr_sec1() to help
functions quickly determine if they are running on SEC1 or SEC2+.
When only SEC1 or SEC2 is compiled in, has_ftr_sec1() return
trivial corresponding value. If both are compiled in, feature
field is checked.
