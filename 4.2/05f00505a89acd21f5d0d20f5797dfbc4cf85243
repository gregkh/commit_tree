ipvs: fix crash if scheduler is changed

I overlooked the svc->sched_data usage from schedulers
when the services were converted to RCU in 3.10. Now
the rare ipvsadm -E command can change the scheduler
but due to the reverse order of ip_vs_bind_scheduler
and ip_vs_unbind_scheduler we provide new sched_data
to the old scheduler resulting in a crash.

To fix it without changing the scheduler methods we
have to use synchronize_rcu() only for the editing case.
It means all svc->scheduler readers should expect a
NULL value. To avoid breakage for the service listing
and ipvsadm -R we can use the "none" name to indicate
that scheduler is not assigned, a state when we drop
new connections.
