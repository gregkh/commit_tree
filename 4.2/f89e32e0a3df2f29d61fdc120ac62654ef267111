x86/fpu: Fix header file dependencies of fpu-internal.h

Fix a minor header file dependency bug in asm/fpu-internal.h: it
relies on i387.h but does not include it. All users of fpu-internal.h
included it explicitly.

Also remove unnecessary includes, to reduce compilation time.

This also makes it easier to use it as a standalone header file
for FPU internals, such as an upcoming C module in arch/x86/kernel/fpu/.
