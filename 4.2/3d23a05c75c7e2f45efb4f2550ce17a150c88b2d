gianfar: Enable changing mac addr when if up

Use device flag IFF_LIVE_ADDR_CHANGE to signal that
the device supports changing the hardware address when
the device is running.
This allows eth_mac_addr() to change the mac address
also when the network device's interface is open.
This capability is required by certain applications,
like bonding mode 6 (Adaptive Load Balancing).
