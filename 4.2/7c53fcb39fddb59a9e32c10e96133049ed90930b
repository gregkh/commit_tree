s390/dasd: Enable automatic loading of dasd_diag_mod

Enabling a DASD that was configured to use the DIAG250 access method
while the corresponding kernel module dasd_diag_mod has not been loaded
fails with an error message. To fix this, users need to manually load
the dasd_diag_mod module.

This procedure can be simplified by automatically loading the
dasd_diag_mod from within the kernel when a DASD configured for DIAG250
is set online.
