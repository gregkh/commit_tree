x86/asm/entry/64: Disentangle error_entry/exit gsbase/ebx/usermode code

The error_entry/error_exit code to handle gsbase and whether we
return to user mdoe was a mess:

 - error_sti was misnamed.  In particular, it did not enable interrupts.

 - Error handling for gs_change was hopelessly tangled the normal
   usermode path.  Separate it out.  This saves a branch in normal
   entries from kernel mode.

 - The comments were bad.

Fix it up.  As a nice side effect, there's now a code path that
happens on error entries from user mode.  We'll use it soon.
