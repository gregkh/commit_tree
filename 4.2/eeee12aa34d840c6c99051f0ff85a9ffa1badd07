crypto: seqiv - Add compatibility support without RNG

When seqiv is used in compatibility mode, this patch allows it
to function even when an RNG Is not available.  It also changes
the RNG allocation for the new explicit seqiv interface so that
we only hold a reference to the RNG during initialisation.
