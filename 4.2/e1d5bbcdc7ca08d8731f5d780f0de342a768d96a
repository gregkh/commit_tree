xen/pcifront: Remove usage of struct timeval

struct timeval uses a 32-bit field for representing seconds, which
will overflow in the year 2038 and beyond. Replace struct timeval with
64-bit ktime_t which is 2038 safe.  This is part of a larger effort to
remove instances of 32-bit timekeeping variables (timeval, time_t and
timespec) from the kernel.
