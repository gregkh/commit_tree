perf tools: Allow events with dot

The Intel events use a dot to separate event name and unit mask.  Allow
dot in names in the scanner, and remove special handling of dot as EOF.
Also remove the hack in jevents to replace dot with underscore. This way
dotted events can be specified directly by the user.

I'm not fully sure this change to the scanner is correct (what was the
dot special case good for?), but I haven't found anything that breaks
with it so far at least.
