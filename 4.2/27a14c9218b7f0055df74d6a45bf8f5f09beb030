ARM: dts: imx23-olinuxino: Add i2c support

The imx23-olinuxino board has an i2c interface exposed on UEXT connector.
This patch enables i2c and selects the pin group used on UEXT connector.
Tested with MOD-LCD1x9 from Olimex.

This patch is based on work by Fadil Berisha with his permission. However
all bugs are mine.
