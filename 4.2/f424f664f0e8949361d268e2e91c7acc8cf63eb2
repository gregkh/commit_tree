f2fs crypto: add encryption policy and password salt support

This patch adds encryption policy and password salt support through ioctl
implementation.

It adds three ioctls:
 F2FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY,
 F2FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY,
 F2FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_PWSALT, which use xattr operations.

Note that, these definition and codes are taken from ext4 crypto support.
For f2fs, xattr operations and on-disk flags for superblock and inode were
changed.
