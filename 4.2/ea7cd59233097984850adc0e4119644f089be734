perf hists browser: Split popup menu actions - part 2

Currently perf_evsel__hists_browse() function spins on a huge loop and
handles many key actions.  Since it's hard to read and modify, let's
split it out into small helper functions.

The add_XXX_opt() functions are to register popup menu item on the
selected entry.  When it adds an item, it also saves related data into
struct popup_action and returns 1 so that it can increase the number of
items (nr_options).

With this change, we can simplify the code just to call selected
callback function without considering various conditions.  A callback
function named do_XXX is called with saved data when the item is
selected by user.

No functional change intended.
