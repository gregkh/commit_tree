checkpatch: add --strict warning for c99 fixed size typedefs : int<size>_t

Using declarations like u_int16_t in kernel code is not preferred.

Suggest the kernel sized types instead of the c99 types when not in the
uapi directory.

Add a $typeC99Typedefs variable for the types to check and neaten the
other typedef variables.
