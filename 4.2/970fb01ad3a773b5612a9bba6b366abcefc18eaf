writeback: add dirty_throttle_control->wb_bg_thresh

wb_bg_thresh is currently treated as a second-class citizen.  It's
only used when BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT is set and balance_dirty_pages()
doesn't calculate it unless the cap is set.  When the cap is set, the
calculated value is not passed around but instead recalculated
whenever it's used.

wb_position_ratio() calculates it by scaling wb_thresh proportional to
bg_thresh / thresh.  wb_update_dirty_ratelimit() uses wb_dirty_limit()
on bg_thresh, which should generally lead to a similar result as the
proportional scaling but can also be way off in the presence of
max/min_ratio settings.

Avoiding wb_bg_thresh calculation saves us one u64 multiplication and
divsion when BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT is not set.  Given that
balance_dirty_pages() is already ratelimited, this doesn't justify the
incurred extra complexity.

This patch adds wb_bg_thresh to dirty_throttle_control and makes
wb_dirty_limits() always calculate it and updates the users to use the
pre-calculated value.
