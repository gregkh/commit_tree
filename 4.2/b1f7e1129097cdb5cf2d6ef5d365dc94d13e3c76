MIPS: BCM77xx: Remove legacy __cpuinit{,data} sections that crept in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time ago.
However a few more crept in as of commit 6ee1d93455384cef8a0426effe85da2
("MIPS: BCM47XX: Detect more then 128 MiB of RAM (HIGHMEM)")

Since we want to clobber the stubs soon, get this removed now.
