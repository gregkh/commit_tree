dm bio prison: add dm_cell_promote_or_release()

Rather than always releasing the prisoners in a cell, the client may
want to promote one of them to be the new holder.  There is a race here
though between releasing an empty cell, and other threads adding new
inmates.  So this function makes the decision with its lock held.

This function can have two outcomes:
i)  An inmate is promoted to be the holder of the cell (return value of 0).
ii) The cell has no inmate for promotion and is released (return value of 1).
