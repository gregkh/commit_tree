sched/dl/Documentation: Add some notes on EDF schedulability

Add a short discussion about sufficient and necessary schedulability tests,
and add a simple example showing that if D_i != P_i then density based tests
are only sufficient.

Also add some references to scientific papers on schedulability tests for
EDF that are both necessary and sufficient, and on their computational
complexity.
