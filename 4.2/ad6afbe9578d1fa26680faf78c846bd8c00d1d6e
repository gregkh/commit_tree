bnx2x: Don't notify about scratchpad parities

The scratchpad is a shared block between all functions of a given device.
Due to HW limitations, we can't properly close its parity notifications
to all functions on legal flows.
E.g., it's possible that while taking a register dump from one function
a parity error would be triggered on other functions.

Today driver doesn't consider this parity as a 'real' parity unless its
being accompanied by additional indications [which would happen in a real
parity scenario]; But it does print notifications for such events in the
system logs.

This eliminates such prints - in case of real parities driver would have
additional indications; But if this is the only signal user will not even
see a parity being logged in the system.
