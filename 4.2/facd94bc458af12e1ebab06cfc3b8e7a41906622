fbdev: ssd1307fb: Allocate page aligned video memory.

Currently the videomemory is allocated by kmalloc, making it a memory
region that is not necessarily page aligend. This leads to problems
upon mmap call, where the video memory's address gets aligned to the
next page boundary. The result is that the userspace program that issued
the mmap call is not able to access the video memory from the start to
the next page boundary.

This patch changes the allocation of the video memory to use
__get_free_pages() in order to obtain memory that is aligned
to page boundaries.
