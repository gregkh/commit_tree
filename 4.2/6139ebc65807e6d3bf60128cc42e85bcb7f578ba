[media] saa7134: fix CodingStyle issues on the lines touched by pr_foo refactor

Several lines touched by the pr_foo refactoring patches are not
following the Linux Coding style.

While we won't be fixing the style globally at the driver, we should,
at least, fix on the lines we touched.

Basically, this patch add (or remove) whitespaces and blank lines
where needed.

No functional changes.
