x86/mm/mtrr: Fix MTRR state checks in mtrr_type_lookup()

'mtrr_state.enabled' contains the FE (fixed MTRRs enabled)
and E (MTRRs enabled) flags in MSR_MTRRdefType.  Intel SDM,
section 11.11.2.1, defines these flags as follows:

 - All MTRRs are disabled when the E flag is clear.
   The FE flag has no affect when the E flag is clear.
 - The default type is enabled when the E flag is set.
 - MTRR variable ranges are enabled when the E flag is set.
 - MTRR fixed ranges are enabled when both E and FE flags
   are set.

MTRR state checks in __mtrr_type_lookup() do not match with SDM.

Hence, this patch makes the following changes:
 - The current code detects MTRRs disabled when both E and
   FE flags are clear in mtrr_state.enabled.  Fix to detect
   MTRRs disabled when the E flag is clear.
 - The current code does not check if the FE bit is set in
   mtrr_state.enabled when looking at the fixed entries.
   Fix to check the FE flag.
 - The current code returns the default type when the E flag
   is clear in mtrr_state.enabled. However, the default type
   is UC when the E flag is clear.  Remove the code as this
   case is handled as MTRR disabled with the 1st change.

In addition, this patch defines the E and FE flags in
mtrr_state.enabled as follows.
 - FE flag: MTRR_STATE_MTRR_FIXED_ENABLED
 - E  flag: MTRR_STATE_MTRR_ENABLED

print_mtrr_state() and x86_get_mtrr_mem_range() are also updated
accordingly.
