[IA64] Drop debug test/printk that some special pages are marked reserved

In commit 92923ca3aace "mm: meminit: only set page reserved in the memblock region"
we dropped setting the reserved bits for all pages. This results in some warnings
on ia64:

put_kernel_page: page at 0xe000000005588000 not in reserved memory
put_kernel_page: page at 0xe000000005588000 not in reserved memory
put_kernel_page: page at 0xe000000005580000 not in reserved memory
put_kernel_page: page at 0xe000000005580000 not in reserved memory
put_kernel_page: page at 0xe000000005580000 not in reserved memory
put_kernel_page: page at 0xe000000005580000 not in reserved memory

the two different pages match up with two objects from the loaded kernel
that get mapped by arch/ia64/mm/init.c:setup_gate()

a000000101588000 D __start_gate_section
a000000101580000 D empty_zero_page

In a discussion with Mel Gorman:
  http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20150526102219.GB13750%40suse.de
he suggested that while the preferred approach might be to
set the reserved bit for these pages, it would also be OK
to just drop the test:
   "as it's a debugging check that is ia-64 specific"

After hunting around a bit and failin to find a good place to mark these
pages as reserved - I decided to just delete the test.
