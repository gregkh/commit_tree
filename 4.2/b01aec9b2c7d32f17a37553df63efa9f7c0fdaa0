EDAC: Cleanup atomic_scrub mess

So first of all, this atomic_scrub() function's naming is bad. It looks
like an atomic_t helper. Change it to edac_atomic_scrub().

The bigger problem is that this function is arch-specific and every new
arch which doesn't necessarily need that functionality still needs to
define it, otherwise EDAC doesn't compile.

So instead of doing that and including arch-specific headers, have each
arch define an EDAC_ATOMIC_SCRUB symbol which can be used in edac_mc.c
for ifdeffery. Much cleaner.

And we already are doing this with another symbol - EDAC_SUPPORT. This
is also much cleaner than having CONFIG_EDAC enumerate all the arches
which need/have EDAC support and drivers.

This way I can kill the useless edac.h header in tile too.
