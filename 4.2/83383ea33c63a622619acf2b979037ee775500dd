staging: wilc1000: remove semaphore wrapper

The various semaphore functions all directly translate into
sema_init(), down() and up(), so we can just remove the API.

This is a mostly automated conversion using simple sed scripts,
plus some manual changes to account for down() returning no
error.

As a positive side-effect, down() no longer hangs after
receiving a signal, as the original code did by looping around
down_interruptible.

The semaphores still need to be turned into mutexes as a
follow-up step.
