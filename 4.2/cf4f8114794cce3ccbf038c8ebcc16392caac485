[media] b2c2: Reset no_base_addr on skystarS2 attach failure

If set, all the other drivers reset no_base_addr on failure to
attach - git commit for this being added to some of them seems to
be eccd15aad72f774b2059f708bc422dbb8493bb30

This driver has been floating around outside the mainline for so
long it hasn't had this fix, so add it in.

Whilst here tidy surrounding code to fix style issues.
