net: Add full IPv6 addresses to flow_keys

This patch adds full IPv6 addresses into flow_keys and uses them as
input to the flow hash function. The implementation supports either
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in a union, and selector is used to determine
how may words to input to jhash2.

We also add flow_get_u32_dst and flow_get_u32_src functions which are
used to get a u32 representation of the source and destination
addresses. For IPv6, ipv6_addr_hash is called. These functions retain
getting the legacy values of src and dst in flow_keys.

With this patch, Ethertype and IP protocol are now included in the
flow hash input.
