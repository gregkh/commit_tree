block: Add support for DAX reads/writes to block devices

If a block device supports the ->direct_access methods, bypass the normal
DIO path and use DAX to go straight to memcpy() instead of allocating
a DIO and a BIO.

Includes support for the DIO_SKIP_DIO_COUNT flag in DAX, as is done in
do_blockdev_direct_IO().
