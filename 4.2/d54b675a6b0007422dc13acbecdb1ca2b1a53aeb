x86: don't use module_init in non-modular devicetree.c code

The devicetree.o is built for "OF" -- which is bool, and hence
this code is either present or absent.  It will never be modular,
so using module_init as an alias for __initcall can be somewhat
misleading.

Fix this up now, so that we can relocate module_init from
init.h into module.h in the future.  If we don't do this, we'd
have to add module.h to obviously non-modular code, and that
would be a worse thing.

Note that direct use of __initcall is discouraged, vs. one
of the priority categorized subgroups.  As __initcall gets
mapped onto device_initcall, our use of device_initcall
directly in this change means that the runtime impact is
zero -- it will remain at level 6 in initcall ordering.
