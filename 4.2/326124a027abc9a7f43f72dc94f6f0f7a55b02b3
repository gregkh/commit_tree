xhci: Calculate old endpoints correctly on device reset

When resetting a device the number of active TTs may need to be
corrected by xhci_update_tt_active_eps, but the number of old active
endpoints supplied to it was always zero, so the number of TTs and the
bandwidth reserved for them was not updated, and could rise
unnecessarily.

This affected systems using Intel's Patherpoint chipset, which rely on
software bandwidth checking.  For example, a Lenovo X230 would lose the
ability to use ports on the docking station after enough suspend/resume
cycles because the bandwidth calculated would rise with every cycle when
a suitable device is attached.

The correct number of active endpoints is calculated in the same way as
in xhci_reserve_bandwidth.
