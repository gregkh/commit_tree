net: bcmgenet: handle broken turn-around for specific PHYs

Some Ethernet PHYs/switches such as Broadcom's BCM53125 have a hardware
bug which makes them not release the MDIO line during turn-around time.
This gets flagged by the GENET MDIO controller as a read failure, and we
fail the read transaction.

Check the MDIO bus phy_ignore_ta_mask bitmask for the PHY we are reading
from and if it is listed in this bitmask, ignore the read failure and
proceed with returning the data we read out of the controller.
