hwmon: Allow to compile dell-smm-hwmon driver without /proc/i8k

This patch splits CONFIG_I8K compile option to SENSORS_DELL_SMM and CONFIG_I8K.
Option SENSORS_DELL_SMM is now used to enable compilation of dell-smm-hwmon
driver and old CONFIG_I8K option to enable /proc/i8k interface in driver.

So this change allows to compile dell-smm-hwmon driver without legacy /proc/i8k
interface which is needed only for old Dell Inspirion models or for userspace
i8kutils package.

For backward compatibility when CONFIG_I8K is enabled then also SENSORS_DELL_SMM
is enabled and so driver dell-smm-hwmon (with /proc/i8k) is compiled.
