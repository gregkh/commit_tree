lib: add software 842 compression/decompression

Add 842-format software compression and decompression functions.
Update the MAINTAINERS 842 section to include the new files.

The 842 compression function can compress any input data into the 842
compression format.  The 842 decompression function can decompress any
standard-format 842 compressed data - specifically, either a compressed
data buffer created by the 842 software compression function, or a
compressed data buffer created by the 842 hardware compressor (located
in PowerPC coprocessors).

The 842 compressed data format is explained in the header comments.

This is used in a later patch to provide a full software 842 compression
and decompression crypto interface.
