crypto: nx - add nx842 constraints

Add "constraints" for the NX-842 driver.  The constraints are used to
indicate what the current NX-842 platform driver is capable of.  The
constraints tell the NX-842 user what alignment, min and max length, and
length multiple each provided buffers should conform to.  These are
required because the 842 hardware requires buffers to meet specific
constraints that vary based on platform - for example, the pSeries
max length is much lower than the PowerNV max length.
