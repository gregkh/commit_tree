ACPI / EC: Fix and clean up register access guarding logics.

In the polling mode, EC driver shouldn't access the EC registers too
frequently. Though this statement is concluded from the non-root caused
bugs (see links below), we've maintained the register access guarding
logics in the current EC driver. The guarding logics can be found here and
there, makes it hard to root cause real timing issues. This patch collects
the guarding logics into one single function so that all hidden logics
related to this can be seen clearly.

The current guarding related code also has several issues:
1. Per-transaction timestamp prevents inter-transaction guarding from being
   implemented in the same place. We have an inter-transaction udelay() in
   acpi_ec_transaction_unblocked(), this logic can be merged into ec_poll()
   if we can use per-device timestamp. This patch completes such merge to
   form a new ec_guard() function and collects all guarding related hidden
   logics in it.
   One hidden logic is: there is no inter-transaction guarding performed
   for non MSI quirk (wait polling mode), this patch skips
   inter-transaction guarding before wait_event_timeout() for the wait
   polling mode to reveal the hidden logic.
   The other hidden logic is: there is msleep() inter-transaction guarding
   performed when the GPE storming is observed. As after merging this
   commit:
     Commit: e1d4d90fc0313d3d58cbd7912c90f8ef24df45ff
     Subject: ACPI / EC: Refine command storm prevention support
   EC_FLAGS_COMMAND_STORM is ensured to be cleared after invoking
   acpi_ec_transaction_unlocked(), the msleep() guard logic will never
   happen now. Since no one complains such change, this logic is likely
   added during the old times where the EC race issues are not fixed and
   the bugs are false root-caused to the timing issue. This patch simply
   removes the out-dated logic. We can restore it by stop skipping
   inter-transaction guarding for wait polling mode.
   Two different delay values are defined for msleep() and udelay() while
   they are merged in this patch to 550us.
2. time_after() causes additional delay in the polling mode (can only be
   observed in noirq suspend/resume processes where polling mode is always
   used) before advance_transaction() is invoked ("wait polling" log is
   added before wait_event_timeout()). We can see 2 wait_event_timeout()
   invocations. This is because time_after() ensures a ">" validation while
   we only need a ">=" validation here:

After cleaning up all guarding logics, we have one single function
ec_guard() collecting all old, non-root-caused, hidden logics. Then we can
easily tune the logics in one place to respond to the bug reports.

Except the time_before() change, all other changes do not change the
behavior of the EC driver.
