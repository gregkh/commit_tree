virtio: add explicit big-endian support to memory accessors

The current memory accessors logic is:
- little endian if little_endian
- native endian (i.e. no byteswap) if !little_endian

If we want to fully support cross-endian vhost, we also need to be
able to convert to big endian.

Instead of changing the little_endian argument to some 3-value enum, this
patch changes the logic to:
- little endian if little_endian
- big endian if !little_endian

The native endian case is handled by all users with a trivial helper. This
patch doesn't change any functionality, nor it does add overhead.
