cxl: Fix error path on probe

When probing we call pci_enable_device() but don't call pci_disable_device() on
fail. This causes refcounting issues in the PCI subsystem if a second driver
tries to bind to the same device.

This patch adds the pci_disable_device() to the probe error path. This error
path is hit when this cxl driver tries to bind to AFUs (on the vPHB) rather
than the physical device.
