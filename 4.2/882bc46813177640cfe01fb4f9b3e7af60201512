mfd: wm5110: Add register patch required for low power sleep

Some register settings must be applied before the first time low power
sleep mode is entered on the wm5110 to ensure optimium performance.
These settings require SYSCLK to be enabled whilst they are being
applied. This patch applies the settings using the recently factored out
boot time SYSCLK functionality.
