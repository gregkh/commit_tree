rocker: remove rocker parameter from functions that have rocker_port parameter

The rocker (switch) of a rocker_port may be trivially obtained from
the latter it seems cleaner not to pass the former to a function when
the latter is being passed anyway.

rocker_port_rx_proc() is omitted from this change as it is a hot path case.
