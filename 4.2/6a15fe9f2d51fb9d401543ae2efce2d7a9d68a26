arm/mach-hisi: remove legacy __CPUINIT section that crept in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time ago.
However a new instance was added in commit 06cc5c1d4d7313bc864e9aac1d1cbd
("ARM: hisi: enable hix5hd2 SoC")

Since we want to clobber the stubs soon, get this removed now.
Note that there would normally be a corresponding removal of
a ".previous" directive, but in this case it appears that this
single function file was never paired off with one.
