xen/xenbus: Don't leak memory when unmapping the ring on HVM backend

The commit ccc9d90a9a8b5c4ad7e9708ec41f75ff9e98d61d "xenbus_client:
Extend interface to support multi-page ring" removes the call to
free_xenballooned_pages() in xenbus_unmap_ring_vfree_hvm(), leaking a
page for every shared ring.

Only with backends running in HVM domains were affected.
