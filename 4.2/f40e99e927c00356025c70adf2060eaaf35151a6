net/mlx4_core: Adjust the schedule queue port for single ported IB VFs

Some VF drivers flow set the schedule queue in the QP context but
without setting none of OPTPAR_SCHED_QUEUE or OPTPAR_PRIMARY_ADDR_PATH.

To allow for such non-modified drivers to function as single ported
IB VFs, we must adjust the schedule queue port whenever being set,
e.g as currently done for single ported Eth VFs.
