toshiba_acpi: Remove no longer needed hci_{read, write}2 functions

This patch removes the hci_{read, write}2 functions from the driver,
and the toshiba_hotkey_event_type_get function was adapted to use the
tci_raw function.

The hci_write2 function was only used by the bluetooth rfkill code,
but since its removal, it was causing build warnings, and the
hci_read2 function was only used by the toshiba_hotkey_event_type_get
function.
