enic: fix issues in enic_poll

In enic_poll, we clean tx and rx queues, when low latency busy socket polling
is happening, enic_poll will only clean tx queue. After cleaning tx, it should
return total budget for re-poll.

There is a small window between vnic_intr_unmask() and enic_poll_unlock_napi().
In this window if an irq occurs and napi is scheduled on different cpu, it tries
to acquire enic_poll_lock_napi() and fails. Unlock napi_poll before unmasking
the interrupt.

v2:
Do not change tx wonk done behaviour. Consider only rx work done for completing
napi.
