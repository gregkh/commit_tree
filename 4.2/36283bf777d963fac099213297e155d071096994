Btrfs: fix fsync xattr loss in the fast fsync path

After commit 4f764e515361 ("Btrfs: remove deleted xattrs on fsync log
replay"), we can end up in a situation where during log replay we end up
deleting xattrs that were never deleted when their file was last fsynced.

This happens in the fast fsync path (flag BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC is
not set in the inode) if the inode has the flag BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING
set, the xattr was added in a past transaction and the leaf where the
xattr is located was not updated (COWed or created) in the current
transaction. In this scenario the xattr item never ends up in the log
tree and therefore at log replay time, which makes the replay code delete
the xattr from the fs/subvol tree as it thinks that xattr was deleted
prior to the last fsync.

Fix this by always logging all xattrs, which is the simplest and most
reliable way to detect deleted xattrs and replay the deletes at log replay
time.

This issue is reproducible with the following test case for fstests:

  seq=`basename $0`
  seqres=$RESULT_DIR/$seq
  echo "QA output created by $seq"

  here=`pwd`
  tmp=/tmp/$$
  status=1	# failure is the default!

  _cleanup()
  {
      _cleanup_flakey
      rm -f $tmp.*
  }
  trap "_cleanup; exit \$status" 0 1 2 3 15

  # get standard environment, filters and checks
  . ./common/rc
  . ./common/filter
  . ./common/dmflakey
  . ./common/attr

  # real QA test starts here

  # We create a lot of xattrs for a single file. Only btrfs and xfs are currently
  # able to store such a large mount of xattrs per file, other filesystems such
  # as ext3/4 and f2fs for example, fail with ENOSPC even if we attempt to add
  # less than 1000 xattrs with very small values.

  # Add many small xattrs to our file.
  # We create such a large amount because it's needed to trigger the issue found
  # in btrfs - we need to have an amount that causes the fs to have at least 3
  # btree leafs with xattrs stored in them, and it must work on any leaf size
  # (maximum leaf/node size is 64Kb).

  done

  # Sync the filesystem to force a commit of the current btrfs transaction, this
  # is a necessary condition to trigger the bug on btrfs.
  sync

  # Now update our file's data and fsync the file.
  # After a successful fsync, if the fsync log/journal is replayed we expect to
  # see all the xattrs we added before with the same values (and the updated file
  # data of course). Btrfs used to delete some of these xattrs when it replayed
  # its fsync log/journal.
  $XFS_IO_PROG -c "pwrite -S 0xbb 8K 16K" \
               -c "fsync" \

  # Allow writes again and mount. This makes the fs replay its fsync log.
  _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_ALLOW_WRITES
  _mount_flakey

  echo "File content after crash and log replay:"
  od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo

  echo "File xattrs after crash and log replay:"
  for ((i = 1; i <= $num_xattrs; i++)); do
      name="user.attr_$(printf "%04d" $i)"
      echo -n "$name="
      $GETFATTR_PROG --absolute-names -n $name --only-values $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
      echo
  done

  status=0
  exit

The golden output expects all xattrs to be available, and with the correct
values, after the fsync log is replayed.
