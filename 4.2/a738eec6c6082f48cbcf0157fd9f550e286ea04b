rcu: Correctly initialize ->rcu_qs_ctr_snap at online time

The rcu_data structure's ->rcu_qs_ctr_snap field is initialized at
CPU-online time from the current CPU's element of the per-CPU rcu_qs_ctr
variable.  Unfortunately, this is at CPU_UP_PREPARE time, so has nothing
to do with the CPU being onlined.  This commit therefore initializes
this variable from the incoming CPU's element of rcu_qs_ctr.
