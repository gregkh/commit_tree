mmc: dt: Allow to specify that no write protect signal is present

Allow to specify in the device-tree that no physical write-protect signal
is connected to a particular instance of a MMC controller. Setting the
property will cause the core will assume that the SD card is always
read-write.

The name for the new property is 'disable-wp' and was chosen based on the
property with the same function from the Synopsys designware mobile storage
host controller DT bindings specification.
