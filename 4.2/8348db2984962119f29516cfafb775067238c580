ath10k: add ATH10K_FW_IE_HTT_OP_VERSION

Target to host HTT messages are conflicting between 10.x and other
firmware revisions. By maintaining separate HTT T2H tables for each
firmware revisions (main, 10x and tlv) similar to WMI abstraction,
solves the conflicts. Add ATH10K_FW_IE_HTT_OP_VERSION so that the firmware can
advertise the HTT interface to ath10k.

This fix is needed to get management frames over HTT (ie.
ATH10K_FW_FEATURE_HAS_WMI_MGMT_TX disabled) working with 10.2.4.48-2 firmware.
Otherwise there will be unknown htt events and nothing works:

[30087.438343] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: htt event (19) not handled
[30087.448691] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: htt event (19) not handled
[30149.032974] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: htt event (19) not handled

If the firmware does not have ATH10K_FW_IE_HTT_OP_VERSION use the main HTT
interface. That way old firmware images will still work.
