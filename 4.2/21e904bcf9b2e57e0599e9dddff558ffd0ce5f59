ASoC: qcom: storm: allocate snd_soc_card struct dynamically.

This patch moves static allocation of snd_soc_card to dynamic allocation,
the reason to do this is to avoid holding up any dangling pointers
in this static structures. And I see no use for having this struct as static
given that the card->name is also populated dynamically from dt.
