libnvdimm: control (ioctl) messages for nvdimm_bus and nvdimm devices

Most discovery/configuration of the nvdimm-subsystem is done via sysfs
attributes.  However, some nvdimm_bus instances, particularly the
ACPI.NFIT bus, define a small set of messages that can be passed to the
platform.  For convenience we derive the initial libnvdimm-ioctl command
formats directly from the NFIT DSM Interface Example formats.

    ND_CMD_SMART: media health and diagnostics
    ND_CMD_GET_CONFIG_SIZE: size of the label space
    ND_CMD_GET_CONFIG_DATA: read label space
    ND_CMD_SET_CONFIG_DATA: write label space
    ND_CMD_VENDOR: vendor-specific command passthrough
    ND_CMD_ARS_CAP: report address-range-scrubbing capabilities
    ND_CMD_ARS_START: initiate scrubbing
    ND_CMD_ARS_STATUS: report on scrubbing state
    ND_CMD_SMART_THRESHOLD: configure alarm thresholds for smart events

If a platform later defines different commands than this set it is
straightforward to extend support to those formats.

Most of the commands target a specific dimm.  However, the
address-range-scrubbing commands target the bus.  The 'commands'
attribute in sysfs of an nvdimm_bus, or nvdimm, enumerate the supported
commands for that object.
