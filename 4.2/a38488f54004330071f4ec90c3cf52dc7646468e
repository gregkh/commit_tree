fm10k: force LPORT delete when updating VLAN or MAC address

Currently, we don't notify the switch at all when the PF
administratively sets a new VLAN or MAC address. This causes the old
addresses to remain valid on the switch table. Since the PF is
overriding any configuration done directly by the VF, we choose to
simply re-create the LPORT for the VF. This does mean that all rules for
the VF will be dropped when we set something directly via the PF, but it
prevents some weird issues where the MAC/VLAN table retains some stale
configuration.
