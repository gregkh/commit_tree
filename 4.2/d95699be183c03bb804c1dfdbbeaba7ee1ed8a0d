usb: chipidea: allow multiple instances to use default ci_default_pdata

Currently, ci_default_pdata is common to all instances of the driver and
gets modified by the core driver code. This is bad if there are multiple
instances of the device with different settings such as the phy type. Fix
this by making a copy of the default platform_data.
