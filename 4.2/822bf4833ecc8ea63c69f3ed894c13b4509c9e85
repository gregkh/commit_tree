arm64: defconfig: enable memtest

The kernel memtest utility is incredibly useful for detecting memory
problems, but sadly isn't in defconfig.

The memtest itself is only run when the user has explicitly passed a
memtest option on the kernel command line, so simply enabling the option
should not have a negative impact.
