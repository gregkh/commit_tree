rcu: Remove redundant offline check

Because offline CPUs are propagated up the rcu_node tree's ->qsmaskinit
bits just before each grace period starts, the ->qsmaskinit bit cannot
be clear when the corresponding ->qsmask bit is set.  Furthermore, this
condition used to correspond to a CPU that was on its way offline, and
making RCU's notion of an offline CPU more precise has eliminated this
situation.  This commit therefore removes the now-redundant offline
check from force_qs_rnp().
