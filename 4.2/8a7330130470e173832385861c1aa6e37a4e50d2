btrfs: Fix lockdep warning of btrfs_run_delayed_iputs()

Liu Bo <bo.li.liu@oracle.com> reported a lockdep warning of
delayed_iput_sem in xfstests generic/241:
  [ 2061.345955] =============================================
  [ 2061.346027] [ INFO: possible recursive locking detected ]
  [ 2061.346027] 4.1.0+ #268 Tainted: G        W
  [ 2061.346027] ---------------------------------------------
  [ 2061.346027] btrfs-cleaner/3045 is trying to acquire lock:
  [ 2061.346027]  (&fs_info->delayed_iput_sem){++++..}, at:
  [<ffffffff814063ab>] btrfs_run_delayed_iputs+0x6b/0x100
  [ 2061.346027] but task is already holding lock:

  [ 2061.346027] other info that might help us debug this:
  [ 2061.346027]  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

  [ 2061.346027]        ----
  [ 2061.346027]   lock(&fs_info->delayed_iput_sem);
  [ 2061.346027]   lock(&fs_info->delayed_iput_sem);
  [ 2061.346027]
   *** DEADLOCK ***
It is rarely happened, about 1/400 in my test env.

The reason is recursion of btrfs_run_delayed_iputs():
  cleaner_kthread
  -> btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() *1
  -> get delayed_iput_sem lock *2
  -> iput()
  -> ...
  -> btrfs_commit_transaction()
  -> btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() *1
  -> get delayed_iput_sem lock (dead lock) *2
  *1: recursion of btrfs_run_delayed_iputs()
  *2: warning of lockdep about delayed_iput_sem

When fs is in high stress, new iputs may added into fs_info->delayed_iputs
list when btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() is running, which cause
second btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() run into down_read(&fs_info->delayed_iput_sem)
again, and cause above lockdep warning.

Actually, it will not cause real problem because both locks are read lock,
but to avoid lockdep warning, we can do a fix.

Fix:
  Don't do btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() in btrfs_commit_transaction() for
  cleaner_kthread thread to break above recursion path.
  cleaner_kthread is calling btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() explicitly in code,
  and don't need to call btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() again in
  btrfs_commit_transaction(), it also give us a bonus to avoid stack overflow.

Test:
  No above lockdep warning after patch in 1200 generic/241 tests.
