perf auxtrace: Add helpers for queuing AUX area tracing data

Provide functions to queue AUX area tracing data buffers for processing.
A AUX area decoder need not use the queues, however Intel BTS and Intel
PT will use them.

There is one queue for each of the mmap buffers that were used for
recording.  Because those mmaps were associated with per-cpu or
per-thread contexts, the data is time-ordered with respect to those
contexts.
