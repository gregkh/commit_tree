blk-mq: make plug work for mutiple disks and queues

Last patch makes plug work for multiple queue case. However it only
works for single disk case, because it assumes only one request in the
plug list. If a task is accessing multiple disks, eg MD/DM, the
assumption is wrong. Let blk_attempt_plug_merge() record request from
the same queue.

V2: use NULL parameter in !mq case. Fix a bug. Add comments in
blk_attempt_plug_merge to make it less (hopefully) confusion.
