fm10k: fix incorrect free on skb in ts_tx_enqueue

This patch resolves a bug in the ts_tx_enqueue code responsible for a
NULL pointer dereference and invalid access of the skb list. We
incorrectly freed the actual skb we found instead of our copy. Thus the
skb queue is essentially invalidated. Resolve this by freeing our clone
in the cases where we did not add it to the queue. This also avoids the
skb memory leak caused by failure to free the clone.
