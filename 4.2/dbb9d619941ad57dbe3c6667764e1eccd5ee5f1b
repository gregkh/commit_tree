staging: unisys: define structures outside of iochannel

During testing with visornic the offset of num_rcv_bufs
was being reported at 188 instead of 186. The vnic structure
starts at 180 and the macaddr is only 6 bytes long.

When I defined and packed the structures outside of the struct
and then referenced them in the struct the correct offset
was generated.
