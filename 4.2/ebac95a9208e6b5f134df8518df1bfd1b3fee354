ASoC: fsl-ssi: Fix bitclock calculation for master mode

According to the datasheet 'pm', 'psr' and 'div2' should never be all 0.
Since commit 541b03ad6cfe ("ASoC: fsl_ssi: Fix the incorrect limitation of
the bit clock rate") this can happen, because for some bitclock rates
'pm' = 0 seems to be a valid choice but does not work due to hardware
restrictions. This results into a bad hardware behaviour (slow audio for
example). Feature tested on a i.MX25.
