[media] marvell-ccic: fix V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR8 support

The REG_CTRL0 register was never written if this format was selected,
instead an error was logged and whatever was last set in that register
was used.

Surprisingly, that seems to work if YUYV was selected, but we should
program this register explicitly.
