test_bpf: add more eBPF jump torture cases

Add two more eBPF test cases for JITs, i.e. the second one revealed a
bug in the x86_64 JIT compiler, where only an int3 filled image from
the allocator was emitted and later wrongly set by the compiler as the
bpf_func program code since optimization pass boundary was surpassed
w/o actually emitting opcodes.

Interpreter:

  [   45.782892] test_bpf: #242 BPF_MAXINSNS: Very long jump backwards jited:0 11 PASS
  [   45.783062] test_bpf: #243 BPF_MAXINSNS: Edge hopping nuthouse jited:0 14705 PASS

After x86_64 JIT (fixed):

  [   80.495638] test_bpf: #242 BPF_MAXINSNS: Very long jump backwards jited:1 6 PASS
  [   80.495957] test_bpf: #243 BPF_MAXINSNS: Edge hopping nuthouse jited:1 17157 PASS
