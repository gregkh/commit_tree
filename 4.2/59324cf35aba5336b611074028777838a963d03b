netlink: allow to listen "all" netns

More accurately, listen all netns that have a nsid assigned into the netns
where the netlink socket is opened.
For this purpose, a netlink socket option is added:
NETLINK_LISTEN_ALL_NSID. When this option is set on a netlink socket, this
socket will receive netlink notifications from all netns that have a nsid
assigned into the netns where the socket has been opened. The nsid is sent
to userland via an anscillary data.

With this patch, a daemon needs only one socket to listen many netns. This
is useful when the number of netns is high.

Because 0 is a valid value for a nsid, the field nsid_is_set indicates if
the field nsid is valid or not. skb->cb is initialized to 0 on skb
allocation, thus we are sure that we will never send a nsid 0 by error to
the userland.
