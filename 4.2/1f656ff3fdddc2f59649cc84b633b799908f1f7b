Drivers: hv: vmbus: Implement NUMA aware CPU affinity for channels

Channels/sub-channels can be affinitized to VCPUs in the guest. Implement
this affinity in a way that is NUMA aware. The current protocol distributed
the primary channels uniformly across all available CPUs. The new protocol
is NUMA aware: primary channels are distributed across the available NUMA
nodes while the sub-channels within a primary channel are distributed amongst
CPUs within the NUMA node assigned to the primary channel.
