ext4: don't retry file block mapping on bigalloc fs with non-extent file

ext4 isn't willing to map clusters to a non-extent file.  Don't signal
this with an out of space error, since the FS will retry the
allocation (which didn't fail) forever.  Instead, return EUCLEAN so
that the operation will fail immediately all the way back to userspace.

(The fix is either to run e2fsck -E bmap2extent, or to chattr +e the file.)
