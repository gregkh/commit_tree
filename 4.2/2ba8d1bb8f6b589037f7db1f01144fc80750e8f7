drm/radeon: SDMA fix hibernation (CI GPU family).

In order for hibernation to reliably work we need to properly turn

proper sequence for clean and full shutdown. So simply reset both
SDMA block, this makes hibernation works reliably on sea island GPU
family (CI)

Hibernation and suspend to ram were tested (several times) on :
Bonaire
Hawaii
Mullins
Kaveri
Kabini
