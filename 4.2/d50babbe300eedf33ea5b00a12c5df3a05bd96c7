xen-blkfront: introduce blkfront_gather_backend_features()

There is a bug when migrate from !feature-persistent host to feature-persistent
host, because domU still thinks new host/backend doesn't support persistent.
Dmesg like:
backed has not unmapped grant: 839
backed has not unmapped grant: 773
backed has not unmapped grant: 773
backed has not unmapped grant: 773
backed has not unmapped grant: 839

The fix is to recheck feature-persistent of new backend in blkif_recover().
See: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/25/469

As Roger suggested, we can split the part of blkfront_connect that checks for
optional features, like persistent grants, indirect descriptors and
flush/barrier features to a separate function and call it from both
blkfront_connect and blkif_recover
