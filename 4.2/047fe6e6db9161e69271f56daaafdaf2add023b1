drm/i915: Allow parsing of variable size child device entries from VBT

VBT version 196 increased the size of common_child_dev_config. The parser
code assumed that the size of this structure would not change.

The modified code now copies the amount needed based on the VBT version,
and emits a debug message if the VBT version is unknown (too new);
since the struct config block won't shrink in newer versions it should
be harmless to copy the maximum known size in such cases, so that's
what we do, but emitting the warning is probably sensible anyway.

In the longer run it might make sense to modify the parser code to
use a version/feature mapping, rather than hardcoding things like this,
but for now the variants are fairly managable.

This fixes a regression introduced in
