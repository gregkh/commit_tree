jbd2: get rid of open coded allocation retry loop

insert_revoke_hash does an open coded endless allocation loop if
journal_oom_retry is true. It doesn't implement any allocation fallback
strategy between the retries, though. The memory allocator doesn't know
about the never fail requirement so it cannot potentially help to move
on with the allocation (e.g. use memory reserves).

Get rid of the retry loop and use __GFP_NOFAIL instead. We will lose the
debugging message but I am not sure it is anyhow helpful.

Do the same for journal_alloc_journal_head which is doing a similar
thing.
