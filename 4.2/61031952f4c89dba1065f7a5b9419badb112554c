arch, x86: pmem api for ensuring durability of persistent memory updates

Based on an original patch by Ross Zwisler [1].

Writes to persistent memory have the potential to be posted to cpu
cache, cpu write buffers, and platform write buffers (memory controller)
before being committed to persistent media.  Provide apis,
memcpy_to_pmem(), wmb_pmem(), and memremap_pmem(), to write data to
pmem and assert that it is durable in PMEM (a persistent linear address
range).  A '__pmem' attribute is added so sparse can track proper usage
of pointers to pmem.

This continues the status quo of pmem being x86 only for 4.2, but
reworks to ioremap, and wider implementation of memremap() will enable
other archs in 4.3.
