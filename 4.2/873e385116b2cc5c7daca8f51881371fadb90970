nfs: make nfs4_init_uniform_client_string use a dynamically allocated buffer

Change the uniform client string generator to dynamically allocate the
NFSv4 client name string buffer. With this patch, we can eliminate the
buffers that are embedded within the "args" structs and simply use the
name string that is hanging off the client.

This uniform string case is a little simpler than the nonuniform since
we don't need to deal with RCU, but we do have two different cases,
depending on whether there is a uniquifier or not.
