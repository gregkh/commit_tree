perf tools: Add hint for 'Too many events are opened.' error message

Enhancing the 'Too many events are opened.' error message with hint to
use use 'ulimit -n <limit>' command.

Before:

  $ perf record -e 'sched:*,syscalls:*' ls
  Error:
  Too many events are opened.
  Try again after reducing the number of events.

Now:

  $ perf record -e 'sched:*,syscalls:*' ls
  Error:
  Too many events are opened.
  Probably the maximum number of open file descriptors has been reached.
  Hint: Try again after reducing the number of events.
  Hint: Try increasing the limit with 'ulimit -n <limit>'
