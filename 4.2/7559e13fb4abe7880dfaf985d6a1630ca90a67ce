x86/mce: Add support for deferred errors on AMD

Deferred errors indicate error conditions that were not corrected, but
those errors have not been consumed yet. They require no action from
S/W (or action is optional). These errors provide info about a latent
uncorrectable MCE that can occur when a poisoned data is consumed by the
processor.

Newer AMD processors can generate deferred errors and can be configured
to generate APIC interrupts on such events.

SUCCOR stands for S/W UnCorrectable error COntainment and Recovery.
It indicates support for data poisoning in HW and deferred error
interrupts.

Add new bitfield to mce_vendor_flags for this. We use this to verify
presence of deferred error interrupts before we enable them in mce_amd.c

While at it, clarify comments in mce_vendor_flags to provide an
indication of usages of the bitfields.
