arm64/efi: map the entire UEFI vendor string before reading it

At boot, the UTF-16 UEFI vendor string is copied from the system
table into a char array with a size of 100 bytes. However, this
size of 100 bytes is also used for memremapping() the source,
which may not be sufficient if the vendor string exceeds 50
UTF-16 characters, and the placement of the vendor string inside
a 4 KB page happens to leave the end unmapped.

So use the correct '100 * sizeof(efi_char16_t)' for the size of
the mapping.
