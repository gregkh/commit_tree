IB/srpt: Convert use of __constant_cpu_to_beXX to cpu_to_beXX

In little endian cases, the macro cpu_to_be{16,32,64} unfolds to
__swab{16,32,64} which provides special case for constants. In
big endian cases, __constant_cpu_to_be{16,32,64} and
cpu_to_be{16,32,64} expand directly to the same expression. So,
replace __constant_cpu_to_be{16,32,64} with cpu_to_be{16,32,64}
with the goal of getting rid of the definitions of
__constant_cpu_to_be{16,32,64} completely.

The Coccinelle semantic patch that performs this transformation
is as follows:

@@expression x;@@

(
- __constant_cpu_to_be16(x)
+ cpu_to_be16(x)
|
- __constant_cpu_to_be32(x)
+ cpu_to_be32(x)
|
- __constant_cpu_to_be64(x)
+ cpu_to_be64(x)
)
