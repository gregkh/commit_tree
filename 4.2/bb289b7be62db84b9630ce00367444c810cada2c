Btrfs: fail on mismatched subvol and subvolid mount options

There's nothing to stop a user from passing both subvol= and subvolid=
to mount, but if they don't refer to the same subvolume, someone is
going to be surprised at some point. Error out on this case, but allow
users to pass in both if they do match (which they could, for example,
get out of /proc/mounts).
