Btrfs: fix warning of bytes_may_use

While running generic/019, dmesg got several warnings from
btrfs_free_reserved_data_space().

Test generic/019 produces some disk failures so sumbit dio will get errors,
in which case, btrfs_direct_IO() goes to the error handling and free
bytes_may_use, but the problem is that bytes_may_use has been free'd
during get_block().

This adds a runtime flag to show if we've gone through get_block(), if so,
don't do the cleanup work.
