crypto: seqiv - Move IV seeding into init function

We currently do the IV seeding on the first givencrypt call in
order to conserve entropy.  However, this does not work with
DRBG which cannot be called from interrupt context.  In fact,
with DRBG we don't need to conserve entropy anyway.  So this
patch moves the seeding into the init function.
