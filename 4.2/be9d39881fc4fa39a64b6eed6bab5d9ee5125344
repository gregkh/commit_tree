usb: musb: host: rely on port_mode to call musb_start()

Currently, we're calling musb_start() twice for DRD ports
in some situations. This has been observed to cause enumeration
issues after suspend/resume cycles with AM335x.

In order to fix the problem, we just have to fix the check
on musb_has_gadget() so that it only returns true if
current mode is Host and ignore the fact that we have or
not a gadget driver loaded.
