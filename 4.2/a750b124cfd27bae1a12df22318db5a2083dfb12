spi: bcm2835: fallback to interrupt for polling timeouts exceeding 2 jiffies

The polling mode of the driver is designed for transfers that run
less than 30us - it will only execute under those circumstances.
So it should run comfortably without getting interrupted by the
scheduler.

But there are situations where the raspberry pi is so overloaded
that it can take up to 80 jiffies until the polling thread gets
rescheduled - this has been observed especially under heavy
IO situations.

In such a situation we now fall back to the interrupt handler and
log the situation at debug level.
