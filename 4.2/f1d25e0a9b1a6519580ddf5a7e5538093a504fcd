dmaengine: mv_xor: Enlarge descriptor pool size

Now that we have 2 channels assigned to 2 CPUs and all requests are chained
on same channels, we need much more descriptors available to satisfy
async_tx workload.

3072 descriptors was found in our lab as the number of descriptors which
allow the async_tx stack to work without waiting for free descriptors on
submission of new requests.
