Revert "dm cache: do not wake_worker() in free_migration()"

This reverts commit 386cb7cdeeef97e0bf082a8d6bbfc07a2ccce07b.

Taking the wake_worker() out of free_migration() will slow writeback
dramatically, and hence adaptability.

Say we have 10k blocks that need writing back, but are only able to
issue 5 concurrently due to the migration bandwidth: it's imperative
that we wake_worker() immediately after migration completion; waiting
for the next 1 second wake up (via do_waker) means it'll take a long
time to write that all back.
