Input: max7359_keypad - do not set MAX7359_CFG_INTERRUPT flag

In datasheet of max7359 there is the following description of this flag:

0 - INT cleared when FIFO empty,
1 - INT cleared after host read. In this mode, I2C should read
    FIFO until interrupt condition removed, or further INT may be lost.

So, if we set this flag, we have to read FIFO until it becomes empty. But
in interrupt we read FIFO just once.  This lead to "keyboard" hang until
reboot, if we press several keys, because of interrupt handler read just
one "press" from FIFO and clear interrupt.
