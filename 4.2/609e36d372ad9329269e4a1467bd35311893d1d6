KVM: x86: pass host_initiated to functions that read MSRs

SMBASE is only readable from SMM for the VCPU, but it must be always
accessible if userspace is accessing it.  Thus, all functions that
read MSRs are changed to accept a struct msr_data; the host_initiated
and index fields are pre-initialized, while the data field is filled
on return.
