dmaengine: at_xdmac: fix bug about channel configuration

When using descriptor view 2 or higher, we don't write the configuration
into AT_XDMAC_CC register because this configuration will be fetch from
the descriptor. Unfortunately, the PROT bit is not updated with this
method, we have to do it manually before enabling the channel.
