ring-buffer: Remove useless unused tracing_off_permanent()

The tracing_off_permanent() call is a way to disable all ring_buffers.
Nothing uses it and nothing should use it, as tracing_off() and
friends are better, as they disable the ring buffers related to
tracing. The tracing_off_permanent() even disabled non tracing
ring buffers. This is a bit drastic, and was added to handle NMIs
doing outputs that could corrupt the ring buffer when only tracing
used them. It is now obsolete and adds a little overhead, it should
be removed.
