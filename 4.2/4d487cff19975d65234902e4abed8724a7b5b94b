drm/i915: Move WaProgramL3SqcReg1Default:bdw to init_clock_gating()

GEN8_L3SQCREG1 isn't saved in the context (verified by going through
a context dump), and so we shouldn't be using the ring w/a code to
initialize it. Also Bspec explicitly talks about MMIO and writing it
with the CPU.

Additionally there's another w/a WaTempDisableDOPClkGating:bdw which
tells us to disable DOP clock gating around the GEN8_L3SQCREG1 write
to make sure everyone notices the change. So let's do that as well.
