xfs: only free allocated regions of inode chunks

An inode chunk is currently added to the transaction free list based on
a simple fsb conversion and hardcoded chunk length. The nature of sparse
chunks is such that the physical chunk of inodes on disk may consist of
one or more discontiguous parts. Blocks that reside in the holes of the
inode chunk are not inodes and could be allocated to any other use or
not allocated at all.

Refactor the existing xfs_bmap_add_free() call into the
xfs_difree_inode_chunk() helper. The new helper uses the existing
calculation if a chunk is not sparse. Otherwise, use the inobt record
holemask to free the contiguous regions of the chunk.
