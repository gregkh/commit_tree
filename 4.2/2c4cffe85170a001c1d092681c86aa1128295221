block: fix bogus EFAULT error from SG_IO ioctl

Whenever blk_fill_sghdr_rq fails, its errno code is ignored and changed to
EFAULT.  This can cause very confusing errors:

  $ sg_persist -k /dev/sda
  persistent reservation in: pass through os error: Bad address

The fix is trivial, just propagate the return value from
blk_fill_sghdr_rq.
