KVM: x86: Fix DR7 mask on task-switch while debugging

If the host sets hardware breakpoints to debug the guest, and a task-switch
occurs in the guest, the architectural DR7 will not be updated. The effective
DR7 would be updated instead.

This fix puts the DR7 update during task-switch emulation, so it now uses the
standard DR setting mechanism instead of the one that was previously used. As a
bonus, the update of DR7 will now be effective for AMD as well.
