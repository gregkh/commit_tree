drm/i915: Move common request allocation code into a common function

The request allocation code is largely duplicated between legacy mode and
execlist mode. The actual difference between the two versions of the code is
pretty minimal.

This patch moves the common code out into a separate function. This is then
called by the execution specific version prior to setting up the one different
value.
