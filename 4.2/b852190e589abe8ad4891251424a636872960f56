scsi: ufs: introduce the capability and quirk for interrupt aggregation

UFS HCI (Host Controller Interface) allows the transfer requests
interrupts to be aggregated to generate the single interrupt but
this can impact the performance. Hence introduce the capability which
gives choice to use the interrupt aggregation capability or not.
By default interrupt aggregation capability is kept disabled.

This change also introduces a quirk for broken interrupt aggregation
feature, as in some UFS controllers, this feature may not work.
