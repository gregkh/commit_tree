KVM: x86: add SMM to the MMU role, support SMRAM address space

This is now very simple to do.  The only interesting part is a simple
trick to find the right memslot in gfn_to_rmap, retrieving the address
space from the spte role word.  The same trick is used in the auditing
code.

The comment on top of union kvm_mmu_page_role has been stale forever,
so remove it.  Speaking of stale code, remove pad_for_nice_hex_output
too: it was splitting the "access" bitfield across two bytes and thus
had effectively turned into pad_for_ugly_hex_output.
