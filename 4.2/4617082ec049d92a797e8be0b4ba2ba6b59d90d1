powerpc/iommu/powernv: Get rid of set_iommu_table_base_and_group

The set_iommu_table_base_and_group() name suggests that the function
sets table base and add a device to an IOMMU group.

The actual purpose for table base setting is to put some reference
into a device so later iommu_add_device() can get the IOMMU group
reference and the device to the group.

At the moment a group cannot be explicitly passed to iommu_add_device()
as we want it to work from the bus notifier, we can fix it later and
remove confusing calls of set_iommu_table_base().

This replaces set_iommu_table_base_and_group() with a couple of
set_iommu_table_base() + iommu_add_device() which makes reading the code
easier.

This adds few comments why set_iommu_table_base() and iommu_add_device()
are called where they are called.

For IODA1/2, this essentially removes iommu_add_device() call from
the pnv_pci_ioda_dma_dev_setup() as it will always fail at this particular
place:
- for physical PE, the device is already attached by iommu_add_device()
in pnv_pci_ioda_setup_dma_pe();
- for virtual PE, the sysfs entries are not ready to create all symlinks
so actual adding is happening in tce_iommu_bus_notifier.
