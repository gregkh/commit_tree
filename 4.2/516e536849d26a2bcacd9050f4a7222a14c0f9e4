perf hists browser: Do not exit when 'f' is pressed in 'report' mode

The 'f' hotkey is only used when in 'top', dynamic mode, to
enable/disable events, currently not making sense in the 'report',
static mode, where we can't go from showing the histogram entries
created from a perf.data file to adding more events after recreating the
evlist created from the perf.data file, albeit possible, this is not
implemented right now.
