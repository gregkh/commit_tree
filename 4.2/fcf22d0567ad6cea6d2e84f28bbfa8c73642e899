drm/edid: Fix up DMT modes

Liu Lei noticed that our 1856x1392@75Hz DMT mode doesn't match the spec.
Fix that up, and also fix up a few other inconsistencies I discovered
by parsing the spec (DMT version 1.0, revision 13) and comparing the
results to our current DMT mode table.

Also clean up the indentation mess for the 1024x768i mode.
