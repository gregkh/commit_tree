wait: introduce wait_event_exclusive_cmd

It's just a variant of wait_event_cmd(), with exclusive flag being set.

For cases like RAID5, which puts many processes to sleep until 1/4
resources are free, a wake_up wakes up all processes to run, but
there is one process being able to get the resource as it's protected
by a spin lock. That ends up introducing heavy lock contentions, and
hurts performance badly.

Here introduce wait_event_exclusive_cmd to relieve the lock contention
naturally by letting wake_up just wake up one process.
