x86/microcode: Disable builtin microcode loading on 32-bit for now

Andy Shevchenko reported machine freezes when booting latest tip
on 32-bit setups. Problem is, the builtin microcode handling cannot
really work that early, when we haven't even enabled paging.

A proper fix would involve handling that case specially as every
other early 32-bit boot case in the microcode loader and would
require much more involved changes for which it is too late now,
more than a week before the upcoming merge window.

So, disable the builtin microcode loading on 32-bit for now.
