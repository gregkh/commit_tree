HID: rmi: fix some harmless BIT() mistakes

These defines are used like this:

	if (!(test_bit(RMI_STARTED, &hdata->flags)))

So the intent was to use bits 0, 1 and 2 but because of the extra BIT()
shifts we're actually using 1, 2 and 4.  It's harmless because it's done
consistently but static checkers will complain.
