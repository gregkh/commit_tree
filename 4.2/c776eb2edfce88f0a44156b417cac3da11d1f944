drm/i915/bxt: don't use unsupported port detection

The port detection register flags in SFUSE_STRAP and DDI_BUF_CTL_A are
not defined for BXT, so don't use them.

Suggested by Satheesh.

v2:
- DDI_BUF_CTL_A bit 0 is not useful on BXT. Making changes to use this
  bit when simulator or BXT is not applicable. Code re-arranged as per
  Damien's suggestion.

v3:
- clarify commit message, add code comment (imre)
