ARM: replace BSYM() with badr assembly macro

BSYM() was invented to allow us to work around a problem with the
assembler, where local symbols resolved by the assembler for the 'adr'
instruction did not take account of their ISA.

Since we don't want BSYM() used elsewhere, replace BSYM() with a new
macro 'badr', which is like the 'adr' pseudo-op, but with the BSYM()
mechanics integrated into it.  This ensures that the BSYM()-ification
is only used in conjunction with 'adr'.
