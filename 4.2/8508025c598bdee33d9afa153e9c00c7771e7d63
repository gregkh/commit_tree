bridge: revert br_dellink change back to original

This is revert of:

commit 68e331c785b8 ("bridge: offload bridge port attributes to switch asic
if feature flag set")

Restore br_dellink back to original and don't call into SELF port driver.
rtnetlink.c:bridge_dellink() already does a call into port driver for SELF.

bridge vlan add/del cmd defaults to MASTER.  From man page for bridge vlan
add/del cmd:

       self   the vlan is configured on the specified physical device.
              Required if the device is the bridge device.

       master the vlan is configured on the software bridge (default).
