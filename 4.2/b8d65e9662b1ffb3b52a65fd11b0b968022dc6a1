powerpc/eeh-powernv: Fix unbalanced IRQ warning

pnv_eeh_next_error() re-enables the eeh opal event interrupt but it
gets called from a loop if there are more outstanding events to
process, resulting in a warning due to enabling an already enabled
interrupt. Instead the interrupt should only be re-enabled once the
last outstanding event has been processed.
