packet: tpacket_snd(): fix signed/unsigned comparison

tpacket_fill_skb() can return a negative value (-errno) which
is stored in tp_len variable. In that case the following
condition will be (but shouldn't be) true:

tp_len > dev->mtu + dev->hard_header_len

as dev->mtu and dev->hard_header_len are both unsigned.

That may lead to just returning an incorrect EMSGSIZE errno
to the user.
