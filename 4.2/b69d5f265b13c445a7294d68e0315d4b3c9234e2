[media] DocBook: add placeholders for ATSC M/H properties

The ATSC M/H specific properties are not properly documented.
This became crearer when converting the existing data into
tables and adding cross references.

For now, just add placeholders, as a further investigation
about the meaning of each parameter is required.
