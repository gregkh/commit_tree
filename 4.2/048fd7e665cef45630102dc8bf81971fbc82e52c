mmc: dw_mmc: insmod followed by rmmod will hung for eMMC

Remove module of dw_mmc driver will hung for eMMC devices if we follow the
steps which are listed below,
	insmod dw_mmc.ko
	insmod dw_mmc-pci.ko
	rmmod dw_mmc-pci.ko

The root cause for this issue is, dw_mci_remove() will disable all the
interrupts by programming 0x0 to INTMASK register then it will call
dw_mci_cleanup_slot(). But dw_mci_cleanup_slot() is issuing CMD6 to
disable the eMMC boot partition and it is waiting for Command Complete
interrupt. Since INTMASK was already cleared by dw_mci_remove(), Command
Complete interrupt is not reaching the system. This leads to process hung.
