drm/i915: Fix possible security hole in command parsing

i915_parse_cmds returns -EACCES on chained batches, which "tells the
caller to abort and dispatch the workload as a non-secure batch",
but the mechanism implementing that was broken when
flags |= I915_DISPATCH_SECURE was moved from i915_gem_execbuffer_parse
to i915_gem_do_execbuffer (17cabf571e50677d980e9ab2a43c5f11213003ae):
i915_gem_execbuffer_parse returns the original batch_obj in this case,
and i915_gem_do_execbuffer doesn't check for that.

Don't set the secure bit in this case to make sure such batches don't
run with elevated priviledges.
