Btrfs: don't attach unnecessary extents to transaction on fsync

We don't need to attach ordered extents that have completed to the current
transaction. Doing so only makes us hold memory for longer than necessary
and delaying the iput of the inode until the transaction is committed (for
each created ordered extent we do an igrab and then schedule an asynchronous
iput when the ordered extent's reference count drops to 0), preventing the
inode from being evictable until the transaction commits.
