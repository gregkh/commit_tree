dmaengine: rcar-dmac: fixup spinlock in rcar-dmac

Current rcar-dmac driver is using spin_lock_irq() / spin_unlock_irq()
in some functions. But, some other driver might call DMAEngine API
during interrupt disabled. In such case, rcar-dmac side spin_unlock_irq()
forcefully allows all interrupts. Therefore, other driver receives
unexpected interruption, and its exclusive access control will be broken.
This patch replaces spin_lock_irq() to spin_lock_irqsave(),
and spin_unlock_irq() to spin_unlock_irqrestore().
