[media] vb2: Push mmap_sem down to memops

Currently vb2 core acquires mmap_sem just around call to
__qbuf_userptr(). However since commit f035eb4e976ef5 (videobuf2: fix
lockdep warning) it isn't necessary to acquire it so early as we no
longer have to drop queue mutex before acquiring mmap_sem. So push
acquisition of mmap_sem down into .get_userptr and .put_userptr memops
so that the semaphore is acquired for a shorter time and it is clearer
what it is needed for.
