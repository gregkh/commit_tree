[media] ivtv: fix two smatch warnings

Smatch currently produces two warnings:
	drivers/media/pci/ivtv/ivtv-fileops.c:901 ivtv_v4l2_close() warn: suspicious bitop condition
	drivers/media/pci/ivtv/ivtv-fileops.c:1026 ivtv_open() warn: suspicious bitop condition

Those are false positives, but it is not hard to get rid of them by
using a different way to evaluate the macro, splitting the logical
boolean evaluation from the bitmap one.
