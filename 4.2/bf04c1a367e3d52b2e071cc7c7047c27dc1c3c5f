iio: adc: vf610: implement configurable conversion modes

Support configurable conversion mode through sysfs. So far, the
mode used was low-power, which is enabled by default now. Beside
that, the modes normal and high-speed are selectable as well.

Use the new device tree property which specifies the maximum ADC
conversion clock frequencies. Depending on the mode used, the
available resulting conversion frequency are calculated
dynamically.
