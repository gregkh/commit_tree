drm/i915: Don't update staged config during force restore modesets

The force restore path relies on the staged config to preserve the
configuration used before a suspend/resume cycle. The update done to it
in intel_modeset_fixup_state() would cause that information to be lost
after the first modeset, making it impossible to restore the modes for
pipes B and C.
