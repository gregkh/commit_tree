usb-storage: ignore ZTE MF 823 card reader in mode 0x1225

This device automatically switches itself to another mode (0x1405)
unless the specific access pattern of Windows is followed in its
initial mode. That makes a dirty unmount of the internal storage
devices inevitable if they are mounted. So the card reader of
such a device should be ignored, lest an unclean removal become
inevitable.

This replaces an earlier patch that ignored all LUNs of this device.
That patch was overly broad.
