rcu: Shut up spurious gcc uninitialized-variable warning

Because gcc doesn't realize that rcu_num_lvls must be strictly greater
than zero, some versions give a spurious warning about levelcnt[0] being
uninitialized in rcu_init_one().  This commit updates the condition on
the pre-existing panic() in order to educate gcc on this point.
