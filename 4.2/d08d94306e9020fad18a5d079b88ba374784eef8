s390/smp: cleanup core vs. cpu in the SCLP interface

The SCLP interface to query, configure and deconfigure CPUs actually
operates on cores. For a machine without the multi-threading faciltiy
a CPU and a core are equivalent but starting with System z13 a core
can have multiple hardware threads, also referred to as logical CPUs.

To avoid confusion replace the word 'cpu' with 'core' in the SCLP
interface. Also replace MAX_CPU_ADDRESS with SCLP_MAX_CORES.
The core-id is an 8-bit field, the maximum thread id is in the range
0-31. The theoretical limit for the CPU address is therefore 8191.
