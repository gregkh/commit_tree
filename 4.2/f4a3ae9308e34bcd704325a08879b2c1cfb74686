GFS2: Use average srttb value in congestion calculations

This patch changes function gfs2_rgrp_congested so that it uses an
average srttb (smoothed round trip time for blocking rgrp glocks)
rather than the CPU-specific value. If we use the CPU-specific value
it can incorrectly report no contention when there really is contention
due to the glock processing occurring on a different CPU.
