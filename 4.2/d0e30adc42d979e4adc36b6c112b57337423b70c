drm/i915: Mark PIN_USER binding as GLOBAL_BIND without the aliasing ppgtt

If the device does not support the aliasing ppgtt, we must translate
user bind requests (PIN_USER) from LOCAL_BIND to a GLOBAL_BIND. However,
since this is device specific we cannot do this conveniently in the
upper layers and so must manage the vma->bound flags in the backend.

Partial revert of commit 75d04a3773ecee617847de963ae4195d6aa74c28 [4.2-rc1]

    drm/i915/gtt: Allocate va range only if vma is not bound

Note this was spotted by Daniel originally, but we dropped the ball in
getting the fix in before the bug going wild. Sorry all.
