ASoC: omap: fix up SND_OMAP_SOC_OMAP_ABE_TWL6040 dependency, again

I tried to fix this before and submitted a working patch, but after
some discussion we came up with what seemed to be a nicer solution,
resulting in commit 3d4cf65e2d ("ASoC: omap: fix up
SND_OMAP_SOC_OMAP_ABE_TWL6040 dependency"). Unfortunately, that
version was incomplete, and we still get this build error:

drivers/clk/clk-palmas.c:46:16: error: field 'hw' has incomplete type
drivers/clk/clk-palmas.c: In function 'to_palmas_clks_info':
drivers/clk/clk-palmas.c:54:74: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Winc

This happens only in randconfig builds that turn on MFD_PALMAS
on a platform other than OMAP2+ when COMPILE_TEST is set
but COMMON_CLK is not.

The new approach is only 'select COMMON_CLK_PALMAS' if we know
that we are on an OMAP5 platform and MFD_PALMAS is already set.
This patch has survived thousands of randconfig builds and I
don't see a remaining hole in the logic.
