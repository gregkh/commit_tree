ARM: 8389/1: Add cpu_resume_arm() for firmwares that resume in ARM state

Some platforms always enter the kernel in the ARM state even if
the kernel is compiled for THUMB2. Add a small wrapper on top of
cpu_resume() that switches into THUMB2 state.

This provides the functionality to fix a problem reported by Kevin
Hilman on next-20150601 where the ifc6410 fails to boot a THUMB2
kernel because the platform's firmware always enters the kernel in
ARM mode from deep idle states.

(rmk: tweaked to work without BSYM->badr changes.)
