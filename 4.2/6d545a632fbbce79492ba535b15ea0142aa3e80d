perf tools: Fix lockup using 32-bit compat vdso

The __machine__findnew_compat() function is called only from
__machine__findnew_vdso_compat() which is called only from
machine__findnew_vdso() which already holds machine->dsos.lock, so
remove locking from __machine__findnew_compat().

This manifests itself tracing 32-bit programs with a 64-bit perf.
