dma-buf: add ref counting for module as exporter

Add reference counting on a kernel module that exports dma-buf and
implements its operations. This prevents the module from being unloaded
while DMABUF file is in use.

The original patch [1] was submitted by Tomasz Stanislawski, but this
is a simpler way to do it.

v3: call module_put() as late as possible, per gregkh's comment.
v2: move owner to struct dma_buf, and use DEFINE_DMA_BUF_EXPORT_INFO
    macro to simplify the change.
