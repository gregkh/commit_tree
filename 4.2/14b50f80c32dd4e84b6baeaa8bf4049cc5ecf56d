Drivers: hv: util: introduce hv_utils_transport abstraction

The intention is to make KVP/VSS drivers work through misc char devices.
Introduce an abstraction for kernel/userspace communication to make the
migration smoother. Transport operational mode (netlink or char device)
is determined by the first received message. To support driver upgrades
the switch from netlink to chardev operational mode is supported.

Every hv_util daemon is supposed to register 2 callbacks:
1) on_msg() to get notified when the userspace daemon sent a message;
2) on_reset() to get notified when the userspace daemon drops the connection.
