net: thunderx: Suppress alloc_pages() failure warnings

Suppressing standard alloc_pages() warnings. Some kernel configs limit
alloc size and the network driver may fail. Do not drop a kernel
warning in this case, instead just drop a oneliner that the network
driver could not be loaded since the buffer could not be allocated.
