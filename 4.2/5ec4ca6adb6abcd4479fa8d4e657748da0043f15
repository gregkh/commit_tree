misc: mic: SCIF Hardware Bus

The SCIF hardware bus abstracts the low level hardware driver details
like interrupts and mapping remote memory so that the same SCIF driver
can work without any changes with the MIC host or card driver as long
as the hardware bus operations are implemented. The SCIF hardware
device is registered by the host and card drivers on the SCIF hardware
bus resulting in probing the SCIF driver.
