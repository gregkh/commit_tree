x86/fpu: Remove 'init_xstate_buf' bootmem allocation

Make init_xstate_buf allocated statically at build time.

This structure's maximum size is around 1KB - and it's allocated even on
most modern embedded x86 CPUs which strive for FPU instruction set parity
with desktop and server CPUs, so it's not like we can save much on smaller
systems.

This removes the last bootmem allocation from the FPU init path, allowing
it to be called earlier in the boot sequence.
