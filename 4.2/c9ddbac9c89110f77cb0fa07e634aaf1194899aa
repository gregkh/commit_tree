PCI: Restore PCI_MSIX_FLAGS_BIRMASK definition

09a2c73ddfc7 ("PCI: Remove unused PCI_MSIX_FLAGS_BIRMASK definition")
removed PCI_MSIX_FLAGS_BIRMASK from an exported header because it was
unused in the kernel.  But that breaks user programs that were using it
(QEMU in particular).

Restore the PCI_MSIX_FLAGS_BIRMASK definition.
