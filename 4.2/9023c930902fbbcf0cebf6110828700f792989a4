tracing: Rename (un)register_ftrace_event() to (un)register_trace_event()

The name "ftrace" really refers to the function hook infrastructure. It
is not about the trace_events. The functions (un)register_ftrace_event() is
really about trace_events, and the name should be register_trace_event()
instead.

Also renamed ftrace_event_reg() to trace_event_reg() for the same reason.
