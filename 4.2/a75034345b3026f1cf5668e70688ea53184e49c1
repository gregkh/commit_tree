staging/lustre/llite: fix ll_getname user buffer copy

strncpy_from_user could return negative values on error,
so need to take those into account.
Since ll_getname is used to get a single component name from userspace
to transfer to server as-is, there's no need to allocate 4k buffer
as done by __getname. Allocate NAME_MAX+1 buffer instead to ensure
we have enough for a null terminated max valid length buffer.
