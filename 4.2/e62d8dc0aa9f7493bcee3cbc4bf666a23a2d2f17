drm/i915: Don't check modeset state in the hw state force restore path

Since the force restore logic will restore the CRTCs state one at a
time, it is possible that the state will be inconsistent until the whole
operation finishes. A call to intel_modeset_check_state() is done once
it's over, so don't check the state multiple times in between. This
regression was introduced in:
