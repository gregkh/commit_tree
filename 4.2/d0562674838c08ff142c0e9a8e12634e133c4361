ACPI / scan: Parse _CCA and setup device coherency

This patch implements support for ACPI _CCA object, which is introduced in
ACPIv5.1, can be used for specifying device DMA coherency attribute.

The parsing logic traverses device namespace to parse coherency
information, and stores it in acpi_device_flags. Then uses it to call
arch_setup_dma_ops() when creating each device enumerated in DSDT
during ACPI scan.

This patch also introduces acpi_dma_is_coherent(), which provides
an interface for device drivers to check the coherency information
similarly to the of_dma_is_coherent().
