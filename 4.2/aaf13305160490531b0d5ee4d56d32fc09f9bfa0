Btrfs: sysfs: reorder the kobject creations

As of now the order in which the kobjects are created
at btrfs_sysfs_add_one() is..
 fsid
 features
 unknown features (dynamic features)
 devices.

Since we would move fsid and device kobject to fs_devices
from fs_info structure, this patch will reorder in which
the kobjects are created as below.
 fsid
 devices
 features
 unknown features (dynamic features)

And hence the btrfs_sysfs_remove_one() will follow the same
in reverse order. and the device kobject destroy now can
be moved into the function __btrfs_sysfs_remove_one()
