blk: clean up plug

Current code looks like inner plug gets flushed with a
blk_finish_plug(). Actually it's a nop. All requests/callbacks are added
to current->plug, while only outmost plug is assigned to current->plug.
So inner plug always has empty request/callback list, which makes
blk_flush_plug_list() a nop. This tries to make the code more clear.
