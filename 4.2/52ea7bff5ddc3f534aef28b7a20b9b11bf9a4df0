MIPS: Get rid of 'kgdb_early_setup' cruft.

Commit 854700115ecf ([MIPS] kgdb: add arch support for the kernel's kgdb core)
added the 'kgdb_early_setup' flag to avoid  calling trap_init() and init_IRQ()
the second time, however the code that called these functions earlier,  from
kgdb_arch_init(), had been already removed by that  time,  so the flag never
served any useful purpose. Remove the related code along with ugly #ifdef'ery
at last.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Folded in Guenter Roeck's fix.]
