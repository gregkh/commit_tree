extcon: arizona: Add support for select accessory detect mode when headphone detection

This patch add support for select accessory detect mode to HPDETL or HPDETR.
Arizona provides a headphone detection circuit on the HPDETL and HPDETR pins
to measure the impedance of an external load connected to the headphone.

Depending on board design, headphone detect pins can change to HPDETR or HPDETL.
