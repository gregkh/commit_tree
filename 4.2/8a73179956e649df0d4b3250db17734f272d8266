writeback: reorganize [__]wb_update_bandwidth()

__wb_update_bandwidth() is called from two places -
fs/fs-writeback.c::balance_dirty_pages() and
mm/page-writeback.c::wb_writeback().  The latter updates only the
write bandwidth while the former also deals with the dirty ratelimit.
The two callsites are distinguished by whether @thresh parameter is
zero or not, which is cryptic.  In addition, the two files define
their own different versions of wb_update_bandwidth() on top of
__wb_update_bandwidth(), which is confusing to say the least.  This
patch cleans up [__]wb_update_bandwidth() in the following ways.

* __wb_update_bandwidth() now takes explicit @update_ratelimit
  parameter to gate dirty ratelimit handling.

* mm/page-writeback.c::wb_update_bandwidth() is flattened into its
  caller - balance_dirty_pages().

* fs/fs-writeback.c::wb_update_bandwidth() is moved to
  mm/page-writeback.c and __wb_update_bandwidth() is made static.

* While at it, add a lockdep assertion to __wb_update_bandwidth().

Except for the lockdep addition, this is pure reorganization and
doesn't introduce any behavioral changes.
