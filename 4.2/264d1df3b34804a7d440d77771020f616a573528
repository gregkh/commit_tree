sunrpc: if we're closing down a socket, clear memalloc on it first

We currently increment the memalloc_socks counter if we have a xprt that
is associated with a swapfile. That socket can be replaced however
during a reconnect event, and the memalloc_socks counter is never
decremented if that occurs.

When tearing down a xprt socket, check to see if the xprt is set up for
swapping and sk_clear_memalloc before releasing the socket if so.
