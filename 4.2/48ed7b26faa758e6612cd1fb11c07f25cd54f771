ipv6: reject locally assigned nexthop addresses

ip -6 addr add dead::1/128 dev eth0
sleep 5
ip -6 route add default via dead::1/128
-> fails
ip -6 addr add dead::1/128 dev eth0
ip -6 route add default via dead::1/128
-> succeeds

reason is that if (nonsensensical) route above is added,
dead::1 is still subject to DAD, so the route lookup will
pick eth0 as outdev due to the prefix route that is added before
DAD work is started.

Add explicit test that checks if nexthop gateway is a local address.
