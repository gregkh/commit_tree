net: Store virtual address instead of page in netdev_alloc_cache

This change makes it so that we store the virtual address of the page
in the netdev_alloc_cache instead of the page pointer.  The idea behind
this is to avoid multiple calls to page_address since the virtual address
is required for every access, but the page pointer is only needed at
allocation or reset of the page.

While I was at it I also reordered the netdev_alloc_cache structure a bit
so that the size is always 16 bytes by dropping size in the case where
PAGE_SIZE is greater than or equal to 32KB.
