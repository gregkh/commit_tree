staging: unisys: unify devmajorminor attributes into visorbus_main.c

The code in devmajorminor_attr.[ch] only creates sysfs files and is
called only in visorbus_main.c.  This code should be unified into
visorbus_main.c.  The only changes are a forward declaration issue with
register_devmajorminor_attributes() and making the functions static.
