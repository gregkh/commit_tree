ALSA: core: Don't ignore errors at creating proc files

So far we've ignored the errors at creating proc files in many places.
But they should be rather treated seriously.

Also, by assuring the error handling, we can get rid of superfluous
snd_info_free_entry() calls as they will be removed by the parent in
the caller side.

This patch fixes the missing error checks and reduces the superfluous
free calls.
