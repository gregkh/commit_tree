x86/PCI: Use host bridge _CRS info on Foxconn K8M890-8237A

The Foxconn K8M890-8237A has two PCI host bridges, and we can't assign
resources correctly without the information from _CRS that tells us which
address ranges are claimed by which bridge.  In the bugs mentioned below,
we incorrectly assign a sound card address (this example is from 1033299):

  bus: 00 index 2 [mem 0x80000000-0xfcffffffff]
  ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (domain 0000 [bus 00-7f])
  pci_root PNP0A08:00: host bridge window [mem 0x80000000-0xbfefffff] (ignored)
  pci_root PNP0A08:00: host bridge window [mem 0xc0000000-0xdfffffff] (ignored)
  pci_root PNP0A08:00: host bridge window [mem 0xf0000000-0xfebfffff] (ignored)
  ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI1] (domain 0000 [bus 80-ff])
  pci_root PNP0A08:01: host bridge window [mem 0xbff00000-0xbfffffff] (ignored)
  pci 0000:80:01.0: [1106:3288] type 0 class 0x000403
  pci 0000:80:01.0: reg 10: [mem 0xbfffc000-0xbfffffff 64bit]
  pci 0000:80:01.0: address space collision: [mem 0xbfffc000-0xbfffffff 64bit] conflicts with PCI Bus #00 [mem 0x80000000-0xfcffffffff]
  pci 0000:80:01.0: BAR 0: assigned [mem 0xfd00000000-0xfd00003fff 64bit]
  BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffc90000378000
  IP: [<ffffffffa0345f63>] azx_create+0x37c/0x822 [snd_hda_intel]

We assigned 0xfd_0000_0000, but that is not in any of the host bridge
windows, and the sound card doesn't work.

Turn on pci=use_crs automatically for this system.
