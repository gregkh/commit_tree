Documentation: dt: add common bindings for hwspinlock

This patch adds the generic common bindings used to represent
a hwlock device and use/request locks in a device-tree build.

Each hwspinlock provider should have the '#hwlock-cells' property,
which represents the number of cells to be used for representing
a specific hwspinlock. Client users shall use the property
'hwlocks' for requesting specific lock(s).

Note that the document is named hwlock.txt deliberately to keep
it a bit more generic.
