mm: new arch_remap() hook

Some architectures would like to be triggered when a memory area is moved
through the mremap system call.

This patch introduces a new arch_remap() mm hook which is placed in the
path of mremap, and is called before the old area is unmapped (and the
arch_unmap() hook is called).
