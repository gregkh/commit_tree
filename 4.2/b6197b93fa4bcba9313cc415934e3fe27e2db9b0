arm64 : Introduce support for ACPI _CCA object

section 6.2.17 _CCA states that ARM platforms require ACPI _CCA
object to be specified for DMA-cabpable devices. Therefore, this patch
specifies ACPI_CCA_REQUIRED in arm64 Kconfig.

In addition, to handle the case when _CCA is missing, arm64 would assign
dummy_dma_ops to disable DMA capability of the device.
