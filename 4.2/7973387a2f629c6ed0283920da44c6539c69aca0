namei: make unlazy_walk and terminate_walk handle nd->stack, add unlazy_link

We are almost done - primitives for leaving RCU mode are aware of nd->stack
now, a new primitive for going to non-RCU mode when we have a symlink on hands
added.

The thing we are heavily relying upon is that *any* unlazy failure will be
shortly followed by terminate_walk(), with no access to nameidata in between.
So it's enough to leave the things in a state terminate_walk() would cope with.
