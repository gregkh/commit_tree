perf tools: Remove redundant initialization of thread linkage members

A thread moves from a rb tree to a list, but can't be on both, because
those linkage members are in a union. This is leftover from when I was
debugging thread refcounting and had nuked that union.

It is harmless duplication, as RB_CLEAR_NODE() does again what
INIT_LIST_HEAD does.
