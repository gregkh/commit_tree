vfio: powerpc/spapr: Move page pinning from arch code to VFIO IOMMU driver

This moves page pinning (get_user_pages_fast()/put_page()) code out of
the platform IOMMU code and puts it to VFIO IOMMU driver where it belongs
to as the platform code does not deal with page pinning.

This makes iommu_take_ownership()/iommu_release_ownership() deal with
the IOMMU table bitmap only.

This removes page unpinning from iommu_take_ownership() as the actual
TCE table might contain garbage and doing put_page() on it is undefined
behaviour.

Besides the last part, the rest of the patch is mechanical.
