f2fs crypto: shrink size of the f2fs_crypto_ctx structure

This patch integrates the below patch into f2fs.

"ext4 crypto: shrink size of the ext4_crypto_ctx structure

Some fields are only used when the crypto_ctx is being used on the
read path, some are only used on the write path, and some are only
used when the structure is on free list.  Optimize memory use by using
a union."
