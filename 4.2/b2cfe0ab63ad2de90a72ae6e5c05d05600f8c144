drm/i915: Fix race on unreferencing the wrong mmio-flip-request

As we perform the mmio-flip without any locking and then try to acquire
the struct_mutex prior to dereferencing the request, it is possible for
userspace to queue a new pageflip before the worker can finish clearing
the old state - and then it will clear the new flip request. The result
is that the new flip could be completed before the GPU has finished
rendering.

The bugs stems from removing the seqno checking in
