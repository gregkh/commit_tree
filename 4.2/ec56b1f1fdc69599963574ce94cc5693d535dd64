xfs: mmap lock needs to be inside freeze protection

Lock ordering for the new mmap lock needs to be:

mmap_sem
  sb_start_pagefault
    i_mmap_lock
      page lock
        <fault processsing>

Right now xfs_vm_page_mkwrite gets this the wrong way around,
While technically it cannot deadlock due to the current freeze
ordering, it's still a landmine that might explode if we change
anything in future. Hence we need to nest the locks correctly.
