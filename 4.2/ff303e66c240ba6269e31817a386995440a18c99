perf: Fix software migrate events

Stephane asked about PERF_COUNT_SW_CPU_MIGRATIONS and I realized it
was borken:

 > The problem is that the task isn't actually scheduled while its being
 > migrated (obviously), and if its not scheduled, the counters aren't
 > scheduled either, so there's no observing of the fact.

 > A further problem with migrations is that many migrations happen from

 > migrations triggered from (soft)irq context. All those end up being

The below cures this by marking a task as migrated and accounting it
on the subsequent sched_in().
