ath10k: rework legacy rx rate decoding

Instead of using a hacky table and magic values
use supported band information advertised to
mac80211.

This may impact performance a little when dealing
with legacy rx rates depending on system
architecture. It's probably negligible.

This also fixes a highly theoretical corner case
when HT/VHT rates weren't reported correctly if
channel frequency wasn't known.
