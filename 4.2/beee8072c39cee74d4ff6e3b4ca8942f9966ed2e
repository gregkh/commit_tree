e1000e: synchronization of MAC-PHY interface only on non- ME systems

On power up, the MAC - PHY interface needs to be set to PCIe, even if
cable is disconnected.  In ME systems, the ME handles this on exit from
Sx state. In non-ME, the driver handles it. Added a check for non-ME
system to the driver code that handles that.
