spi: davinci: change the lower limit of pre-scale divider to 1

SPI hardware spec for Keystone specify a lower value of 0 for pre-scale
divider which determine what max value of spi clock (spi-max-frequency)
the device can support. This translates to a clock divider of 2. So fix
the lower limit value used for the boundary check in
davinci_spi_get_prescale() function to 1 so that a maximum of spi device
clock rate / 2 is possible to be set for spi-max-frequency.
