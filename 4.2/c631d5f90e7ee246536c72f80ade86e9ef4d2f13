      drm: add support for tiled/compressed/etc modifier in addfb2

Missed the structure packing/alignment problem where 64-bit
members were added after the odd number of 32-bit ones. This
makes the compiler produce structures of different sizes under
32- and 64-bit x86 targets and makes the ioctl need explicit
compat handling.

v2: Removed the typedef. (Daniel Vetter)
