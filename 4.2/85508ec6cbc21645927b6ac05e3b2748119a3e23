zram: use idr instead of `zram_devices' array

This patch makes some preparations for on-demand device add/remove
functionality.

Remove `zram_devices' array and switch to id-to-pointer translation (idr).
idr doesn't bloat zram struct with additional members, f.e.  list_head,
yet still provides ability to match the device_id with the device pointer.

No user-space visible changes.
