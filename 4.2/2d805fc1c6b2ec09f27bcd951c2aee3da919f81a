mailbox: Fix up error handling in mbox_request_channel()

mbox_request_channel() currently returns EBUSY in the event the controller
is not present or if of_xlate() fails, but in neither case is EBUSY really
appropriate.  Return EPROBE_DEFER if the controller is not yet present
and change of_xlate() to return an ERR_PTR instead of NULL so that the
error can be propagated back to the caller of mbox_request_channel().
