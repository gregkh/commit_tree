clk: berlin: drop direct of_iomap of nodes reg property

The Berlin clock driver was sharing a DT node with the pin controller
and the reset driver. All these devices are now sub-nodes of the chip
controller. This patch rework the Berlin clock driver to allow moving
the Berlin clock DT bindings into their own sub-node of the chip
controller node.
