sunrpc: make xprt->swapper an atomic_t

Split xs_swapper into enable/disable functions and eliminate the
"enable" flag.

Currently, it's racy if you have multiple swapon/swapoff operations
running in parallel over the same xprt. Also fix it so that we only
set it to a memalloc socket on a 0->1 transition and only clear it
on a 1->0 transition.
