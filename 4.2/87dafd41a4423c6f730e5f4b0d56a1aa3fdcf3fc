x86/fpu: Rename xstate related 'fx' references to 'xstate'

So the xstate code was probably first copied from the fxregs code,
hence it carried over the 'fx' naming for the state pointer variable.

But this is slightly confusing, as we usually on call the (legacy)
MMX/SSE state 'fx', both in data structures and in the functions
build around FXSAVE/FXRSTOR.

So rename it to 'xstate' to make it more apparent what it is related to.
