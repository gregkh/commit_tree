drm/i915: s/\<rq\>/req/g

The merged seqno->request conversion from John called request
variables req, but some (not all) of Chris' recent patches changed
those to just rq. We've had a lenghty (and inconclusive) discussion on
irc which is the more meaningful name with maybe at most a slight bias
towards req.

Given that the "don't change names without good reason to avoid
conflicts" rule applies, so lets go back to a req everywhere for
consistency. I'll sed any patches for which this will cause conflicts
before applying.

mass-conversion patch was from Chris, the merged one from John.]
