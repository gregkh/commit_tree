tcp: fill shinfo->gso_size at last moment

In commit cd7d8498c9a5 ("tcp: change tcp_skb_pcount() location") we stored
gso_segs in a temporary cache hot location.

This patch does the same for gso_size.

This allows to save 2 cache line misses in tcp xmit path for
the last packet that is considered but not sent because of
various conditions (cwnd, tso defer, receiver window, TSQ...)
