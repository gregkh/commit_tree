mfd: cros_ec: Move protocol helpers out of the MFD driver

The MFD driver should only have the logic to instantiate its child devices
and setup any shared resources that will be used by the subdevices drivers.

The cros_ec MFD is more complex than expected since it also has helpers to
communicate with the EC. So the driver will only get more bigger as other
protocols are supported in the future. So move the communication protocol
helpers to its own driver as drivers/platform/chrome/cros_ec_proto.c.
