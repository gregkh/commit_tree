pwm: atmel: Fix incorrect CDTY value after disabling

pwm-leds calls .config() and .disable() in a row. This exhibits that it
may happen that the channel gets disabled before CDTY has been updated
with CUPD. The issue gets quite worse with long periods. So, ensure that
at least one period has past before disabling the channel by polling
ISR.
