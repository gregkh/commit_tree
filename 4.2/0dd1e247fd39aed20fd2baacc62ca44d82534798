drivers: PL011: add support for the ARM SBSA generic UART

The ARM Server Base System Architecture[1] document describes a
generic UART which is a subset of the PL011 UART.
It lacks DMA support, baud rate control and modem status line
control, among other things.
The idea is to move the UART initialization and setup into the
firmware (which does this job today already) and let the kernel just
use the UART for sending and receiving characters.

We use the recent refactoring to build a new struct uart_ops
variable which points to some new functions avoiding access to the
missing registers. We reuse as much existing PL011 code as possible.

In contrast to the PL011 the SBSA UART does not define any AMBA or
PrimeCell relations, so we go with a pretty generic probe function
which only uses platform device functions.
A DT binding is provided with this patch, ACPI support is added in a
separate one.
