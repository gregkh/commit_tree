ALSA: hda - Set patch_ops before calling auto-parser

... so that the parser code can overwrite some optional ops.  For
Realtek and others, it can be set solely in the spec allocator, so it
results in a good code cleanup, too.

With this change, we can finally remove the local stream_pm setup and
rely on the generic parser's automatic setting.
