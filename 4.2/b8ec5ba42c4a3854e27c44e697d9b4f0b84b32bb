crypto: drbg - use Jitter RNG to obtain seed

During initialization, the DRBG now tries to allocate a handle of the
Jitter RNG. If such a Jitter RNG is available during seeding, the DRBG
pulls the required entropy/nonce string from get_random_bytes and
concatenates it with a string of equal size from the Jitter RNG. That
combined string is now the seed for the DRBG.

Written differently, the initial seed of the DRBG is now:

get_random_bytes(entropy/nonce) || jitterentropy (entropy/nonce)

If the Jitter RNG is not available, the DRBG only seeds from
get_random_bytes.
