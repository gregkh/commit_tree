mm: clean up per architecture MM hook header files

Commit 2ae416b142b6 ("mm: new mm hook framework") introduced an empty
header file (mm-arch-hooks.h) for every architecture, even those which
doesn't need to define mm hooks.

As suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven, this could be cleaned through the use
of a generic header file included via each per architecture
asm/include/Kbuild file.

The PowerPC architecture is not impacted here since this architecture has
to defined the arch_remap MM hook.
