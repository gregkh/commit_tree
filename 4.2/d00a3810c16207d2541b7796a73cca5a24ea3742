arm64: context-switch user tls register tpidr_el0 for compat tasks

Since commit a4780adeefd0 ("ARM: 7735/2: Preserve the user r/w register
TPIDRURW on context switch and fork"), arch/arm/ has context switched
the user-writable TLS register, so do the same for compat tasks running
under the arm64 kernel.
