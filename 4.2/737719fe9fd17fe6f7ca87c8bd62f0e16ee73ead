iwlwifi: mvm: iterate all interfaces during HW recovery cleanup

Usually during HW recovery the state of all active interfaces is cleaned
up during drv_start(). There's a special case where a HW restart is
requested when an interface is going down. In this case the iface-iterator
won't see this interface and we won't clean it. This has bad consequences
once the interface is legitimately brought up again.
