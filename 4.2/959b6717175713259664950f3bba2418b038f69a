gfs2: handle NULL rgd in set_rgrp_preferences

The function set_rgrp_preferences() does not handle the (rarely
returned) NULL value from gfs2_rgrpd_get_next() and this patch
fixes that.

The fs image in question is only 150MB in size which allows for
only 1 rgrp to be created. The in-memory rb tree has only 1 node
and when gfs2_rgrpd_get_next() is called on this sole rgrp, it
returns NULL. (Default behavior is to wrap around the rb tree and
return the first node to give the illusion of a circular linked
list. In the case of only 1 rgrp, we can't have
gfs2_rgrpd_get_next() return the same rgrp (first, last, next all
point to the same rgrp)... that would cause unintended consequences
and infinite loops.)
