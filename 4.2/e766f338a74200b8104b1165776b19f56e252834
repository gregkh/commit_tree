i2c: mux: Use __i2c_transfer() instead of calling parent's master_xfer()

Newly introduced quirks infrastructure doesn't work for the devices behind
MUXes because MUX's master_xfer() calls parent's master_xfer() directly
without checking the quirks. Instead of duplicating check code in MUX just
call __i2c_transfer() instead. This has a side effect on tracing (messages
will appear on both MUX bus and parent bus), but maybe that's not bad at
the end.
