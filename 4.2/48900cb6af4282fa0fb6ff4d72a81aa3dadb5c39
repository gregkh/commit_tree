virtio-net: drop NETIF_F_FRAGLIST

virtio declares support for NETIF_F_FRAGLIST, but assumes
that there are at most MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 2 fragments which isn't
always true with a fraglist.

A longer fraglist in the skb will make the call to skb_to_sgvec overflow
the sg array, leading to memory corruption.

Drop NETIF_F_FRAGLIST so we only get what we can handle.
