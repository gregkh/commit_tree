toshiba_bluetooth: Add RFKill handler functions

This patch adds RFKill handler functions to the driver, allowing it
to register and update the rfkill switch status.

Also, a comment block was moved from the header to the poll function,
as it explains why we need to poll the killswitch on older devices.
