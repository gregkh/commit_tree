target/user: Add support for bidirectional commands

Enable TCMU to handle bidirectional SCSI commands. In such cases,
entries in iov[] cover both the Data-In and the Data-Out buffers. The
first iov_cnt entries correspond to the Data-Out buffer, while the
remaining iov_bidi_cnt entries correspond to the Data-In buffer.
