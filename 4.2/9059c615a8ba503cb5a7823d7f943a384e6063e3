staging: panel: remove duplicate code

both the misc_deregister(), parport_release() and
parport_unregister_device() is there in the module_exit function also.
detach is called from parport_unregister_driver() and by the time
detach executes misc_deregister(), parport_release() and
parport_unregister_device() has already executed marking
keypad_initialized and lcd.initialized  as false. so this part of the
code will never execute.
