MIPS: tlbex: Avoid unnecessary _PAGE_PRESENT shifts

Commit c5b367835cfc ("MIPS: Add support for XPA.") added generation of a
shift by _PAGE_PRESENT_SHIFT in build_pte_present() and
build_pte_writable(), however except for the XPA case this is always
zero making it unnecessary.

Make the shift conditional upon _PAGE_PRESENT_SHIFT being non-zero to
save an instruction in those cases.
