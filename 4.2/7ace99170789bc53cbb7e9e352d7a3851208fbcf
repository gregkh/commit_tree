mm, meminit: allow early_pfn_to_nid to be used during runtime

early_pfn_to_nid() historically was inherently not SMP safe but only
used during boot which is inherently single threaded or during hotplug
which is protected by a giant mutex.

With deferred memory initialisation there was a thread-safe version
introduced and the early_pfn_to_nid would trigger a BUG_ON if used
unsafely.  Memory hotplug hit that check.  This patch makes
early_pfn_to_nid introduces a lock to make it safe to use during
hotplug.
