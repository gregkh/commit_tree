pinctrl: mediatek: Add Pinctrl/GPIO driver for mt6397.

Add mt6397 support using mediatek common pinctrl driver.

mt6397 is a PMIC, and pinctrl/GPIO is part of 6397 chip.
Pinctrl/GPIO driver should obtain regmap from PMIC,
so adding this support to common code.

Also, mt6397 is no need to support interrupt controller,
so changing common code to skip it.
