can: fix loss of CAN frames in raw_rcv

commit 514ac99c64b "can: fix multiple delivery of a single CAN frame for
overlapping CAN filters" requires the skb->tstamp to be set to check for
identical CAN skbs.

As net timestamping is influenced by several players (netstamp_needed and
netdev_tstamp_prequeue) Manfred missed a proper timestamp which leads to
CAN frame loss.

As skb timestamping became now mandatory for CAN related skbs this patch
makes sure that received CAN skbs always have a proper timestamp set.
Maybe there's a better solution in the future but this patch fixes the
CAN frame loss so far.
