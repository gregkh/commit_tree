writeback: do foreign inode detection iff cgroup writeback is enabled

Currently, even when a filesystem doesn't set the FS_CGROUP_WRITEBACK
flag, if the filesystem uses wbc_init_bio() and wbc_account_io(), the
foreign inode detection and migration logic still ends up activating
cgroup writeback which is unexpected.  This patch ensures that the
foreign inode detection logic stays disabled when inode_cgwb_enabled()
is false by not associating writeback_control's with bdi_writeback's.

This also avoids unnecessary operations in wbc_init_bio(),
wbc_account_io() and wbc_detach_inode() for filesystems which don't
support cgroup writeback.
