phy: twl4030-usb: remove pointless 'suspended' test in 'suspend' callback.

When the runtime_suspend callback is running, 'runtime_status'
is always RPM_SUSPENDING, so pm_runtime_suspended() will always
fail.
Similarly while the runtime_resume callback is running
'runtime_status' is RPM_RESUMING, so pm_runtime_active() will
always fail.

So remove these two pointless tests.
