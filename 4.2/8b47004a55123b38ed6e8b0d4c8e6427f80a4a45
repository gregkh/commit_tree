hpsa: add interrupt number to /proc/interrupts interrupt name

Add the interrupt number to the interrupt names that
appear in /proc/interrupts, so they are unique

Also, delete the IRQ and DAC prints.  Other parts of the kernel
already print the IRQ assignments, and dual-address-cycle support
has not been interesting since the parallel PCI bus went from
32 to 64 bits wide.
