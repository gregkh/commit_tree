toshiba_bluetooth: Add a container struct named toshiba_bluetooth_dev

This patch adds a struct named toshiba_bluetooth_dev, which will be
used to contain the acpi_device struct and bluetooth status booleans.

This struct will also be used by later patches to store the rfkill
struct as well.

Also, a helper function named toshiba_bluetooth_sync_status was added
to be also used by upcomming patches.
