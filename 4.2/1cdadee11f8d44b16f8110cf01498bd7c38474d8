xfs: randomly do sparse inode allocations in DEBUG mode

Sparse inode allocations generally only occur when full inode chunk
allocation fails. This requires some level of filesystem space usage and
fragmentation.

For filesystems formatted with sparse inode chunks enabled, do random
sparse inode chunk allocs when compiled in DEBUG mode to increase test
coverage.
