staging: rtl8192u/ieee80211/ieee80211_softmac.c: auth parse error code byte order fix

auth_parse() return result is in incorrect le16 byte order. Currently
this still works since the user code merely checks if error code is
equal to 0. However debug statement in ieee80211_check_auth_response()
prints the error code in the incorrect le16 byte order. This fix
corrects the byte order as cpu order.
