mtd: blktrans: change blktrans_getgeo return value

Modify function blktrans_getgeo()'s return value to -EOPNOTSUPP when
dev->tr->getgeo == NULL.

We shouldn't make the return value to 0 when dev->tr->getgeo == NULL,
because the function blktrans_getgeo() has an output value "hd_geometry"
which is usually used by some application, if returns 0 (i.e.,
"success"), it will make some application get the wrong information.
