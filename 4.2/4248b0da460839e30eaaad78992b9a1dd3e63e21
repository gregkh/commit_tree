fs, file table: reinit files_stat.max_files after deferred memory initialisation

Dave Hansen reported the following;

	My laptop has been behaving strangely with 4.2-rc2.  Once I log
	in to my X session, I start getting all kinds of strange errors
	from applications and see this in my dmesg:

        	VFS: file-max limit 8192 reached

The problem is that the file-max is calculated before memory is fully
initialised and miscalculates how much memory the kernel is using.  This
patch recalculates file-max after deferred memory initialisation.  Note
that using memory hotplug infrastructure would not have avoided this
problem as the value is not recalculated after memory hot-add.

4.1:             files_stat.max_files = 6582781
4.2-rc2:         files_stat.max_files = 8192
4.2-rc2 patched: files_stat.max_files = 6562467

Small differences with the patch applied and 4.1 but not enough to matter.
