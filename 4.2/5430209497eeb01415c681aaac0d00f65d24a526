Smack: freeing an error pointer in smk_write_revoke_subj()

This code used to rely on the fact that kfree(NULL) was a no-op, but
then we changed smk_parse_smack() to return error pointers on failure
instead of NULL.  Calling kfree() on an error pointer will oops.

I have re-arranged things a bit so that we only free things if they
have been allocated.
