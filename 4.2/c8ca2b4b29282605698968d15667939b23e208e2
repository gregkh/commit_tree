ARM: keystone2: move update of the phys-to-virt constants into generic code

Make the init_meminfo function return the offset to be applied to the
phys-to-virt translation constants.  This allows us to move the update
into generic code, along with the requirements for this update.

This avoids platforms having to know the details of the phys-to-virt
translation support.
