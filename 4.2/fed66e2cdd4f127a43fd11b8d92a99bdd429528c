perf: Fix fasync handling on inherited events

Vince reported that the fasync signal stuff doesn't work proper for
inherited events. So fix that.

Installing fasync allocates memory and sets filp->f_flags |= FASYNC,
which upon the demise of the file descriptor ensures the allocation is
freed and state is updated.

Now for perf, we can have the events stick around for a while after the
original FD is dead because of references from child events. So we
cannot copy the fasync pointer around. We can however consistently use
the parent's fasync, as that will be updated.
