time: Rework debugging variables so they aren't global

Ingo suggested that the timekeeping debugging variables
recently added should not be global, and should be tied
to the timekeeper's read_base.

Thus this patch implements that suggestion.

This version is different from the earlier versions
as it keeps the variables in the timekeeper structure
rather then in the tkr.
