clk: s/clk/core/ for struct clk_core

While introducing struct clk_core we tried to minimize the diff
by changing the type of 'clk' variables from struct clk to struct
clk_core without changing the names of the variables. Now that
the split is complete, the code is slightly confusing when it
mixes variables called 'clk' and variables called 'core' that are
of the same type struct clk_core. Let's be consistent and use
'core' everywhere we have a struct clk_core pointer and 'clk'
when we have a struct clk pointer.
