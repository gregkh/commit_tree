HID: hid-input: Fix accessing freed memory during device disconnect

During unbinding the driver was dereferencing a pointer to memory
already freed by power_supply_unregister().

Driver was freeing its internal description of battery through pointers
stored in power_supply structure. However, because the core owns the
power supply instance, after calling power_supply_unregister() this
memory is freed and the driver cannot access these members.

Fix this by storing the pointer to internal description of battery in a
local variable before calling power_supply_unregister(), so the pointer
remains valid.
