rtl8192u: don't duplicate ieee80211 constants for status/auth/reason

These are all defined as a part of the standard and should not be
duplicated on a per-driver basis.  Use the global ones and delete the
local ones.

In switching to <linux/ieee80211.h> we have to delete a local copy of
an identical struct that we prepped earlier to have identical field
names, and we add explicit include <...> where needed in order to
preserve getting a successful compile.

This isn't the totality of duplicated data removed, but it is a start.
