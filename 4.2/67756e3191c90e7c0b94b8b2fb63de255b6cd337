ALSA: pcm: Fix lockdep warning with nonatomic PCM ops

With the nonatomic PCM ops, the system may spew lockdep warnings like:

 =============================================
 [ INFO: possible recursive locking detected ]
 4.2.0-rc1-jeejaval3 #12 Not tainted
 ---------------------------------------------
 aplay/4029 is trying to acquire lock:
  (snd_pcm_link_rwsem){.+.+.+}, at: [<ffffffff816fd473>] snd_pcm_stream_lock+0x43/0x60

 but task is already holding lock:
  (snd_pcm_link_rwsem){.+.+.+}, at: [<ffffffff816fcf29>] snd_pcm_action_nonatomic+0x29/0x80

 other info that might help us debug this:
  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0
        ----
   lock(snd_pcm_link_rwsem);
   lock(snd_pcm_link_rwsem);

Although this is false-positive as the rwsem is taken always as
read-only for these code paths, it's certainly annoying to see this at
any occasion.  A simple fix is to use down_read_nested() in
snd_pcm_stream_lock() that can be called inside another lock.
