Documentation: ABI: sysfs-firmware-dmi: add -entries suffix to file name

The dmi-sysfs module adds DMI table structures entries under
/sys/firmware/dmi/entries only, so rename documentation file to
sysfs-firmware-dmi-entries as more appropriate. Without renaming it's
confusing to differ this from sysfs-firmware-dmi-tables that adds raw
DMI table and actually adds "dmi" kobject.
