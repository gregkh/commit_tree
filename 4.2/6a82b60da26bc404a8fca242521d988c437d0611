sched/core: Remove __cpuinit section tag that crept back in

We removed __cpuinit support (leaving no-op stubs) quite some time
ago.  However this one crept back in as of commit a803f0261bb2bb57aab
("sched: Initialize rq->age_stamp on processor start")

Since we want to clobber the stubs too, get this removed now.
