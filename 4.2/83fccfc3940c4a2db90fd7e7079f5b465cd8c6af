inet: fix potential deadlock in reqsk_queue_unlink()

When replacing del_timer() with del_timer_sync(), I introduced
a deadlock condition :

reqsk_queue_unlink() is called from inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop()

inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop() can be called from many contexts,
one being the timer handler itself (reqsk_timer_handler()).

In this case, del_timer_sync() loops forever.

Simple fix is to test if timer is pending.
