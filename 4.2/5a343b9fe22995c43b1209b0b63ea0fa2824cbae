ARC: entry.S: [arcompact] simplify SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_STK

Previously this macro was overloaded with stack switching, saving SP at right
slot in pt_regs, saving/setup of r25 and setting SP baseline to where
pt_regs->sp is saved (vs. bottom of pt_regs)

Now it only does SP switch, and leaves SP pointing to bottom of pt_regs.

r25 saving is no longer done here to allow for future reordering of
regfile in pt_regs w/o touching this macro
