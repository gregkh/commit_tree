locking/pvqspinlock: Fix kernel panic in locking-selftest

Enabling locking-selftest in a VM guest may cause the following
kernel panic:

  kernel BUG at .../kernel/locking/qspinlock_paravirt.h:137!

This is due to the fact that the pvqspinlock unlock function is
expecting either a _Q_LOCKED_VAL or _Q_SLOW_VAL in the lock
byte. This patch prevents that bug report by ignoring it when
debug_locks_silent is set. Otherwise, a warning will be printed
if it contains an unexpected value.

With this patch applied, the kernel locking-selftest completed
without any noise.
