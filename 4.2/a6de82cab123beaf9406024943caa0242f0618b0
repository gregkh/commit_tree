xfs: Correctly lock inode when removing suid and file capabilities

Currently XFS calls file_remove_privs() without holding i_mutex. This is
wrong because that function can end up messing with file permissions and
file capabilities stored in xattrs for which we need i_mutex held.

Fix the problem by grabbing iolock exclusively when we will need to
change anything in permissions / xattrs.
