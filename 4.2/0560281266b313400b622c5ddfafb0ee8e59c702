x86/fpu: Split out the fpu__activate_fpstate_read() method

Currently fpu__activate_fpstate() is used for two distinct purposes:

  - read access by ptrace and core dumping, where in the core dumping
    case the current task's FPU state may be examined as well.

  - write access by ptrace, which modifies FPU registers and expects
    the modified registers to be reloaded on the next context switch.

Split out the reading side into fpu__activate_fpstate_read().

( Note that this is just a pure duplication of fpu__activate_fpstate()
  for the time being, we'll optimize the new function in the next patch. )
