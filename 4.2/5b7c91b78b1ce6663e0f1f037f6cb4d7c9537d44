drm/i915/chv: Set min freq to efficient frequency on chv

After feedback from the hardware team, now we set the GPU min/idel freq to RPe.
Punit is expecting us to operate GPU between Rpe & Rp0. If we drop the
frequency to RPn, punit is failing to change the vgg input voltage to
minimum :(

Since Punit validates the rps range [RPe, RP0]. This patch
removes unused cherryview_rps_min_freq function.

v2: Change commit message

v3: set min_freq before idle_freq (chris)

v4: Squash 'Remove unused rps min function' patch
