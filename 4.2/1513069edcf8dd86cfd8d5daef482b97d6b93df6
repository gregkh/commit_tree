fib_trie: Drop unnecessary calls to leaf_pull_suffix

It was reported that update_suffix was taking a long time on systems where
a large number of leaves were attached to a single node.  As it turns out
fib_table_flush was calling update_suffix for each leaf that didn't have all
of the aliases stripped from it.  As a result, on this large node removing
one leaf would result in us calling update_suffix for every other leaf on
the node.

The fix is to just remove the calls to leaf_pull_suffix since they are
redundant as we already have a call in resize that will go through and
update the suffix length for the node before we exit out of
fib_table_flush or fib_table_flush_external.
