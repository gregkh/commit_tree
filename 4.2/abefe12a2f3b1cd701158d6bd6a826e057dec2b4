[media] ir-sony-decoder: shutup smatch warnings

There are some false-positive warnings produced by smatch:
	drivers/media/rc/ir-sony-decoder.c:129 ir_sony_decode() warn: missing break? reassigning 'data->state'
	drivers/media/rc/ir-sony-decoder.c:137 ir_sony_decode() warn: missing break? reassigning 'data->state'
	drivers/media/rc/ir-sony-decoder.c:165 ir_sony_decode() warn: missing break? reassigning 'data->state'

This is due to the logic used there to detect the need of a break.

While those are false positives, it is easy to get rid of them without
any drawbacks. The side effect is a cleaner function, with is good.
