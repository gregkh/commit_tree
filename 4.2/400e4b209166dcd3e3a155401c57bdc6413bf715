x86/fpu: Rename xsave.header::xstate_bv to 'xfeatures'

'xsave.header::xstate_bv' is a misnomer - what does 'bv' stand for?

It probably comes from the 'XGETBV' instruction name, but I could
not find in the Intel documentation where that abbreviation comes
from. It could mean 'bit vector' - or something else?

But how about - instead of guessing about a weird name - we named
the field in an obvious and descriptive way that tells us exactly
what it does?

So rename it to 'xfeatures', which is a bitmask of the
xfeatures that are fpstate_active in that context structure.

Eyesore like:

           fpu->state->xsave.xsave_hdr.xstate_bv |= XSTATE_FP;

is now much more readable:

           fpu->state->xsave.header.xfeatures |= XSTATE_FP;

Which form is not just infinitely more readable, but is also
shorter as well.
