hpsa: add ioaccel sg chaining for the ioaccel2 path

Increase the request size for ioaccel2 path.

The error, if any, returned by hpsa_allocate_ioaccel2_sg_chain_blocks
to hpsa_alloc_ioaccel2_cmd_and_bft should be returned upstream rather
than assumed to be -ENOMEM.

This differs slightly from hpsa_alloc_ioaccel1_cmd_and_bft,
which does not call another hpsa_allocate function and only
has -ENOMEM to return from some kmalloc calls.
