acpi-video-detect: Unregister acpi_video backlight when dmi quirks are added

Make acpi_video_set_dmi_backlight_type() call
acpi_video_unregister_backlight() when the new dmi quirk results in
the desired backlight interface being of a type other then
acpi_backlight_video.

This avoid the need for the second if in the following construction
which is currently found in many platform/x86 drivers:

	if (prefer_vendor_quirk)
		acpi_video_dmi_promote_vendor();

	if (!acpi_video_backlight_support())
		acpi_video_unregister_backlight()

This second if-block will be removed from the platform drivers as part
of their conversion to the new backlight interface selection API.
