ftrace: Fix breakage of set_ftrace_pid

Commit 4104d326b670 ("ftrace: Remove global function list and call function
directly") simplified the ftrace code by removing the global_ops list with a
new design. But this cleanup also broke the filtering of PIDs that are added
to the set_ftrace_pid file.

Add back the proper hooks to have pid filtering working once again.
