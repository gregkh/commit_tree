cpufreq: Don't allow updating inactive policies from sysfs

Later commits would change the way policies are managed today. Policies
wouldn't be freed on cpu hotplug (currently they aren't freed only for
suspend), and while the CPU is offline, the sysfs cpufreq files would
still be present.

User may accidentally try to update the sysfs files in following
directory: '/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/'. And that would
result in undefined behavior as policy wouldn't be active then.

Apart from updating the store() routine, we also update __cpufreq_get()
which can call cpufreq_out_of_sync(). The later routine tries to update
policy->cur and starts notifying kernel about it.
