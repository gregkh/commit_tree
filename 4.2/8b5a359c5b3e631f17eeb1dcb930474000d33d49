Input: goodix - fix touch coordinates on WinBook TW100 and TW700

The touchscreen on the WinBook TW100 and TW700 don't match the default
display, with 0,0 touches being reported when touching at the bottom
right of the screen.

It's unfortunately impossible to detect this problem with data from the
DSDT, or other auxiliary metadata, so fallback to quirking this specific
model of tablet instead.
