Btrfs: fix memory leak in the extent_same ioctl

We were allocating memory with memdup_user() but we were never releasing
that memory. This affected pretty much every call to the ioctl, whether
it deduplicated extents or not.

This issue was reported on IRC by Julian Taylor and on the mailing list
by Marcel Ritter, credit goes to them for finding the issue.
