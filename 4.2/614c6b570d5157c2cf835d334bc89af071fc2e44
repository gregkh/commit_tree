perf tools: Leave DSO destruction to the map destruction

As the way DSOs are created are normally via dsos__findnew, so that we
don't have to load the same dso multiple times for multiple maps (think
about /lib64/libc.so.6), so they may be shared and dso__delete() should
be left to be done as part of the map destruction process.

This will all be properly solved by reference counting struct dso, which
will be done soon.
