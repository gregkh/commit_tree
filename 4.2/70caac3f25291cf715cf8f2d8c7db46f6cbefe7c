ARM: dts: OMAP5: Fix broken pbias device creation

commit <ed8509edddeb> ("ARM: dts: omap5: add minimal l4 bus
layout with control module support") moved pbias_regulator dt node
from being a child node of ocp to be the child node of
omap5_padconf_global. After this device for pbias_regulator is
not created.

Fix it by adding "simple-bus" compatible property to
omap5_padconf_global dt node.

layout with control module support")
