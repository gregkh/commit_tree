fuse: separate out input queue

The input queue contains normal requests (fc->pending), forgets
(fc->forget_*) and interrupts (fc->interrupts).  There's also fc->waitq and
fc->fasync for waking up the readers of the fuse device when a request is
available.

The fc->reqctr is also moved to the input queue (assigned to the request
when the request is added to the input queue.

This patch just rearranges the fields, no functional change.
