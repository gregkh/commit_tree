drm/i915: Return the frontbuffer flip to enable intel_crtc_enable_planes.

Without this frontbuffer flip when enabling planes PSR got compromised
and wasn't being enabled waiting forever on the flush that never
arrived.

Another solution would to create a enable_cursor function and split this
frontbuffer flip among the different plane enable and disable functions.
But if necessary this can be done in a follow up work. For now let's
just fix the regression.

It was removed by:
