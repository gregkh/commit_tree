pcmcia: do not break rsrc_nonstatic when handling anonymous cards

Patch 1c6c9b1d9d25 caused a regression for rsrc_nonstatic: It relies
on pccard_validate_cis() to determine whether an iomem resource can
be used for PCMCIA cards. This override, however, lead invalid iomem
resources to be accepted -- and lead to a fake CIS being used instead
of the original CIS.

To fix this issue, move the override for anonymous cards to the one
place where it is needed -- when adding a PCMCIA device.
