net: tcp: dctcp_update_alpha() fixes.

dctcp_alpha can be read by from dctcp_get_info() without
synchro, so use WRITE_ONCE() to prevent compiler from using
dctcp_alpha as a temporary variable.

Also, playing with small dctcp_shift_g (like 1), can expose
an overflow with 32bit values shifted 9 times before divide.

Use an u64 field to avoid this problem, and perform the divide
only if acked_bytes_ecn is not zero.
