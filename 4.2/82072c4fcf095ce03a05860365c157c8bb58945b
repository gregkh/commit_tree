rcu: Change function declaration to bool

rcu_cpu_has_callbacks() is declared int. The current declaration was introduced
in commit c0f4dfd4f90f (rcu: Make RCU_FAST_NO_HZ take advantage of numbered
callbacks). But it is actually returning bool and as the function description
states " * Return true if the specified CPU has any callback....", this probably
should be a bool as all (3) call-sites currently treat it as bool.

Type-checking coccinelle spatches are being used to locate type mismatches
between function signatures and return values in this case this produced:
./kernel/rcu/tree.c:3538 WARNING: return of wrong type
                    int != bool,

Patch was compile tested with x86_64_defconfig (implies CONFIG_TREE_RCU=y)

Patch is against 4.1-rc3 (localversion-next is -next-20150511) and fixes
