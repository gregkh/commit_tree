pNFS/flexfiles: Turn off layoutcommit for servers that don't need it

This patch ensures that we record the value of 'ffl_flags' from
the layout, and then checks for the presence of the
FF_FLAGS_NO_LAYOUTCOMMIT flag before deciding whether or not to
call pnfs_set_layoutcommit().

The effect is that servers now can decide whether or not they want
the client to call layoutcommit before returning a writeable layout.
