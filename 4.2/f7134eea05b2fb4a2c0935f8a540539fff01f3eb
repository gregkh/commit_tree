w1_therm reference count family data

A temperature conversion can take 750 ms and when possible the
w1_therm slave driver drops the bus_mutex to allow other bus
operations, but that includes operations such as a periodic slave
search, which can remove this slave when it is no longer detected.
If that happens the sl->family_data will be freed and set to NULL
causing w1_slave_show to crash when it wakes up.
