tpm, tpm_crb: fail when TPM2 ACPI table contents look corrupted

At least some versions of AMI BIOS have corrupted contents in the TPM2
ACPI table and namely the physical address of the control area is set to
zero.

This patch changes the driver to fail gracefully  when we observe a zero
address instead of continuing to ioremap.
