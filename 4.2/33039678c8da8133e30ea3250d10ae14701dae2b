mm/hugetlb: handle races in alloc_huge_page and hugetlb_reserve_pages

alloc_huge_page and hugetlb_reserve_pages use region_chg to calculate the
number of pages which will be added to the reserve map.  Subpool and
global reserve counts are adjusted based on the output of region_chg.
Before the pages are actually added to the reserve map, these routines
could race and add fewer pages than expected.  If this happens, the
subpool and global reserve counts are not correct.

Compare the number of pages actually added (region_add) to those expected
to added (region_chg).  If fewer pages are actually added, this indicates
a race and adjust counters accordingly.
