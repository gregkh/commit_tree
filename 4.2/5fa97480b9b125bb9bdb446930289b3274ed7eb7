Drivers: hv: kvp: reset kvp_context

We set kvp_context when we want to postpone receiving a packet from vmbus due
to the previous transaction being unfinished. We, however, never reset this
state, all consequent kvp_respond_to_host() calls will result in poll_channel()
calling hv_kvp_onchannelcallback(). This doesn't cause real issues as:
1) Host is supposed to serialize transactions as well
2) If no message is pending vmbus_recvpacket() will return 0 recvlen.
This is just a cleanup.
