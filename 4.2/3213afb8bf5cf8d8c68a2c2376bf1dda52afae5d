Revert "Input: zforce - don't overwrite the stack"

This reverts commit 7d01cd261c76f95913c81554a751968a1d282d3a because
with given FRAME_MAXSIZE of 257 the check will never trigger and it
causes warnings from GCC (with -Wtype-limits). Also the check was
incorrect as it was not accounting for the already read 2 bytes of data
stored in the buffer.
