libnvdimm, nfit, nd_blk: driver for BLK-mode access persistent memory

The libnvdimm implementation handles allocating dimm address space (DPA)
between PMEM and BLK mode interfaces.  After DPA has been allocated from
a BLK-region to a BLK-namespace the nd_blk driver attaches to handle I/O
as a struct bio based block device. Unlike PMEM, BLK is required to
handle platform specific details like mmio register formats and memory
controller interleave.  For this reason the libnvdimm generic nd_blk
driver calls back into the bus provider to carry out the I/O.

This initial implementation handles the BLK interface defined by the
ACPI 6 NFIT [1] and the NVDIMM DSM Interface Example [2] composed from
DCR (dimm control region), BDW (block data window), IDT (interleave
descriptor) NFIT structures and the hardware register format.
