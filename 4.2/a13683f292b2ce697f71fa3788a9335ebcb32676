tipc: adjust locking policy of subscription

Currently subscriber's lock protects not only subscriber's subscription
list but also all subscriptions linked into the list. However, as all
members of subscription are never changed after they are initialized,
it's unnecessary for subscription to be protected under subscriber's
lock. If the lock is used to only protect subscriber's subscription
list, the adjustment not only makes the locking policy simpler, but
also helps to avoid a deadlock which may happen once creating a
subscription is failed.
