drm/i915: Fix up the vma aliasing ppgtt binding

Currently we have the problem that the decision whether ptes need to
be (re)written is splattered all over the codebase. Move all that into
i915_vma_bind. This needs a few changes:
- Just reuse the PIN_* flags for i915_vma_bind and do the conversion
  to vma->bound in there to avoid duplicating the conversion code all
  over.
- We need to make binding for EXECBUF (i.e. pick aliasing ppgtt if
  around) explicit, add PIN_USER for that.
- Two callers want to update ptes, give them a PIN_UPDATE for that.

Of course we still want to avoid double-binding, but that should be
taken care of:
- A ppgtt vma will only ever see PIN_USER, so no issue with
  double-binding.
- A ggtt vma with aliasing ppgtt needs both types of binding, and we
  track that properly now.
- A ggtt vma without aliasing ppgtt could be bound twice. In the
  lower-level ->bind_vma functions hence unconditionally set
  GLOBAL_BIND when writing the ggtt ptes.

There's still a bit room for cleanup, but that's for follow-up
patches.

v2: Fixup fumbles.

v3: s/PIN_EXECBUF/PIN_USER/ for clearer meaning, suggested by Chris.
