tcp: improve RTT from SACK for CC

tcp_sacktag_one() always picks the earliest sequence SACKed for RTT.
This might not make sense for congestion control in cases where:

  1. ACKs are lost, i.e. a SACK following a lost SACK covers both
     new and old segments at the receiver.
  2. The receiver disregards the RFC 5681 recommendation to immediately
     ACK out-of-order segments.

Give congestion control a RTT for the latest segment SACKed, which is the
most accurate RTT estimate, but preserve the conservative RTT for RTO.

Removes the call to skb_mstamp_get() in tcp_sacktag_one().
