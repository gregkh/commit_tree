arm64: kill flush_cache_all()

The documented semantics of flush_cache_all are not possible to provide
for arm64 (short of flushing the entire physical address space by VA),
and there are currently no users; KVM uses VA maintenance exclusively,
cpu_reset is never called, and the only two users outside of arch code
cannot be built for arm64.

While cpu_soft_reset and related functions (which call flush_cache_all)
were thought to be useful for kexec, their current implementations only
serve to mask bugs. For correctness kexec will need to perform
maintenance by VA anyway to account for system caches, line migration,
and other subtleties of the cache architecture. As the extent of this
cache maintenance will be kexec-specific, it should probably live in the
kexec code.

This patch removes flush_cache_all, and related unused components,
preventing further abuse.
