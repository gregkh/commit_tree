tcp: don't use F-RTO on non-recurring timeouts

Currently F-RTO may repeatedly send new data packets on non-recurring
timeouts in CA_Loss mode. This is a bug because F-RTO (RFC5682)
should only be used on either new recovery or recurring timeouts.

This exacerbates the recovery progress during frequent timeout &
repair, because we prioritize sending new data packets instead of
repairing the holes when the bandwidth is already scarce.

Fix it by correcting the test of a new recovery episode.
