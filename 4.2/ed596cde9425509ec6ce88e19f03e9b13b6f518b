Revert x86 sigcontext cleanups

This reverts commits 9a036b93a344 ("x86/signal/64: Remove 'fs' and 'gs'
from sigcontext") and c6f2062935c8 ("x86/signal/64: Fix SS handling for
signals delivered to 64-bit programs").

They were cleanups, but they break dosemu by changing the signal return
behavior (and removing 'fs' and 'gs' from the sigcontext struct - while
not actually changing any behavior - causes build problems).
