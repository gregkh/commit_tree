misc: mic: SCIF ring buffer infrastructure

SCIF ring buffer is a single producer, single consumer byte stream
ring buffer optimized for avoiding reads across the PCIe bus while
adding the required barriers and hardware workarounds for the MIC
Coprocessor. The ring buffer is used to implement a receive queue for
SCIF driver messaging between two nodes and for byte stream messaging
between SCIF endpoints. The existing in-kernel ring buffer was not
reused since it has not been designed for our use across the PCIe bus
where each node runs an independent OS. Each SCIF node has a receive
queue for every other SCIF node, and each connected endpoint has a
receive queue for messages from its peer. This pair of receive
queues is referred to as a SCIF queue pair.
