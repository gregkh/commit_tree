i2c: at91: add support to FIFOs

When FIFOs are available and enabled, the driver now configures the Atmel
eXtended DMA Controller to perform word accesses instead of byte accesses
when possible.
The actual access width depends on the size of the buffer to transmit.

To enable FIFO support the "atmel,fifo-size" property must be set properly
in the I2C controller node of the device tree.
