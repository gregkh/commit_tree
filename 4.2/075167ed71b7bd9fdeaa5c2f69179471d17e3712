drivers: PL011: replace UART_MIS reading with _RIS & _IMSC

The PL011 register UART_MIS is actually a bitwise AND of the
UART_RIS and the UART_MISC register.
Since the SBSA UART does not include the _MIS register, use the
two separate registers to get the same behaviour. Since we are
inside the spinlock and we read the _IMSC register only once, there
should be no race issue.
