xfs: fix xfs_log_done interface

Instead of the confusing flags argument pass a boolean flag to indicate if
we want to release or regrant a log reservation.

Also ensure that xfs_log_done always drop the reference on the log ticket,
to both simplify the code and make the logic in xfs_trans_roll easier
to understand.
