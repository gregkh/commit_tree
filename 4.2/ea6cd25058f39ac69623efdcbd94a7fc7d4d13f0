x86: Rename eisa_set_level_irq to elcr_set_level_irq

This routine has been around for over a decade, but with EISA
being dead and abandoned for about twice that long, the name can
be kind of confusing.  The function is going at the PIC Edge/Level
Configuration Registers (ELCR), so rename it as such and mentally
decouple it from the long since dead EISA bus.
