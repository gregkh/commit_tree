mtip32xx: Abort I/O during secure erase operation

Currently I/Os are being queued when secure erase operation starts, and issue
them after the operation completes. As all data will be gone when the operation
completes, any queued I/O doesn't make sense. Hence, abort I/O (return -ENODATA)
as soon as the driver receives.
