libceph: treat sockaddr_storage with uninitialized family as blank

addr_is_blank() should return true if family is neither AF_INET nor
AF_INET6.  This is what its counterpart entity_addr_t::is_blank_ip() is
doing and it is the right thing to do: in process_banner() we check if
our address is blank and if it is "learn" it from our peer.  As it is,
we never learn our address and always send out a blank one.  This goes
way back to ceph.git commit dd732cbfc1c9 ("use sockaddr_storage; and
some ipv6 support groundwork") from 2009.

While at at, do not open-code ipv6_addr_any() and use INADDR_ANY
constant instead of 0.
