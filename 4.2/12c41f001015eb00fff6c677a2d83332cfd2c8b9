staging:lustre: merge socklnd_lib-linux.h into socklnd.h

Originally socklnd_lib-linux.h contained linux specific
wrappers and defines but since the linux kernel is the
only supported platform now we can merge what little
remains in the header into socklnd.h. This is broken
out of the original patch 12932 that was merged to the
Intel/OpenSFS branch.
