hpsa: refactor and rework support for sending TEST_UNIT_READY

Factor out the code which sends the TEST_UNIT_READY from
wait_for_device_to_become_ready() into its own function.

Move the code which waits for the TEST_UNIT_READY from
wait_for_device_to_become_ready() into its own function.

If a logical drive has failed, resetting it will ensure
outstanding commands are completed, but polling it with
TURs after the reset will not work because the TURs will
never report good status.  So successful TUR should not
be a condition of success for the device reset error
handler.
