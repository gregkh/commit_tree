ceph: fix flushing caps

Current ceph_fsync() only flushes dirty caps and wait for them to be
flushed. It doesn't wait for caps that has already been flushing.
This patch makes ceph_fsync() wait for pending flushing caps too.
Besides, this patch also makes caps_are_flushed() peroperly handle
tid wrapping.
