[media] uvcvideo: Fix incorrect bandwidth with Chicony device 04f2:b50b

The "TOSHIBA Web Camera - 5M" Chicony device (04f2:b50b) seems to
compute the bandwidth on 16 bits and erroneously sign-extend it to
32 bits, resulting in a huge bandwidth value. Detect and fix that
condition by setting the 16 MSBs to 0 when they're all equal to 1.
