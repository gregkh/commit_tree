mm: meminit: initialise remaining struct pages in parallel with kswapd

Only a subset of struct pages are initialised at the moment.  When this
patch is applied kswapd initialise the remaining struct pages in parallel.

This should boot faster by spreading the work to multiple CPUs and
initialising data that is local to the CPU.  The user-visible effect on
large machines is that free memory will appear to rapidly increase early
in the lifetime of the system until kswapd reports that all memory is
initialised in the kernel log.  Once initialised there should be no other
user-visibile effects.
