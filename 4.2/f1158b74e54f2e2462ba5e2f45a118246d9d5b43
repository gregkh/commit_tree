bridge: mdb: zero out the local br_ip variable before use

Since commit b0e9a30dd669 ("bridge: Add vlan id to multicast groups")
there's a check in br_ip_equal() for a matching vlan id, but the mdb
functions were not modified to use (or at least zero it) so when an
entry was added it would have a garbage vlan id (from the local br_ip
variable in __br_mdb_add/del) and this would prevent it from being
matched and also deleted. So zero out the whole local ip var to protect
ourselves from future changes and also to fix the current bug, since
there's no vlan id support in the mdb uapi - use always vlan id 0.
Example before patch:
root@debian:~# bridge mdb add dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
root@debian:~# bridge mdb
dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
root@debian:~# bridge mdb del dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument

After patch:
root@debian:~# bridge mdb add dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
root@debian:~# bridge mdb
dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
root@debian:~# bridge mdb del dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.0.0.1 permanent
root@debian:~# bridge mdb
