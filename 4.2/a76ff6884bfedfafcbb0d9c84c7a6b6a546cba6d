powerpc: Fix smp_mb__before_spinlock()

Currently, smp_mb__before_spinlock() is defined to be smp_wmb()
in core code, but this is not sufficient on PowerPC.  This patch
therefore supplies an override for the generic definition to
strengthen smp_mb__before_spinlock() to smp_mb(), as is needed
on PowerPC.
