genirq: Introduce irq_set_vcpu_affinity() to target an interrupt to a VCPU

With Posted-Interrupts support in Intel CPU and IOMMU, an external
interrupt from assigned-devices could be directly delivered to a
virtual CPU in a virtual machine. Instead of hacking KVM and Intel
IOMMU drivers, we propose a platform independent interface to target
an interrupt to a specific virtual CPU in a virtual machine, or set
virtual CPU affinity for an interrupt.

By adopting this new interface and the hierarchy irqdomain, we could
easily support posted-interrupts on Intel platforms, and also provide
flexible enough interfaces for other platforms to support similar
features.

Here is the usage scenario for this interface:
Guest update MSI/MSI-X interrupt configuration
        -->QEMU and KVM handle this
        -->KVM call this interface (passing posted interrupts descriptor
           and guest vector)
        -->irq core will transfer the control to IOMMU
        -->IOMMU will do the real work of updating IRTE (IRTE has new
           format for VT-d Posted-Interrupts)
