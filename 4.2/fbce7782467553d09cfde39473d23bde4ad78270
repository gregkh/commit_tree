x86/fpu: Merge fpu__reset() and fpu__clear()

With recent cleanups and fixes the fpu__reset() and fpu__clear()
functions have become almost identical in functionality: the only
difference is that fpu__reset() assumed that the fpstate
was already active in the eagerfpu case, while fpu__clear()
activated it if it was inactive.

This distinction almost never matters, the only case where such
fpstate activation happens if if the init thread (PID 1) gets exec()-ed
for the first time.

So keep fpu__clear() and change all fpu__reset() uses to
fpu__clear() to simpify the logic.

( In a later patch we'll further simplify fpu__clear() by making
  sure that all contexts it is called on are already active. )
