ARCv2: barriers

ARCv2 based HS38 cores are weakly ordered and thus explicit barriers for
kernel proper.

SMP barrier is provided by DMB instruction which also guarantees local
barrier hence used as backend of smp_*mb() as well as *mb() APIs

Also hookup barriers into MMIO accessors to avoid ordering issues in IO
