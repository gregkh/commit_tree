xfs: remove the flags argument to xfs_trans_cancel

xfs_trans_cancel takes two flags arguments: XFS_TRANS_RELEASE_LOG_RES and
XFS_TRANS_ABORT.  Both of them are a direct product of the transaction
state, and can be deducted:

 - any dirty transaction needs XFS_TRANS_ABORT to be properly canceled,
   and XFS_TRANS_ABORT is a noop for a transaction that is not dirty.
 - any transaction with a permanent log reservation needs
   XFS_TRANS_RELEASE_LOG_RES to be properly canceled, and passing
   XFS_TRANS_RELEASE_LOG_RES for a transaction without a permanent
   log reservation is invalid.

So just remove the flags argument and do the right thing.
