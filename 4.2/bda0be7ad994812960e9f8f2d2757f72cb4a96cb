security: make inode_follow_link RCU-walk aware

inode_follow_link now takes an inode and rcu flag as well as the
dentry.

inode is used in preference to d_backing_inode(dentry), particularly
in RCU-walk mode.

selinux_inode_follow_link() gets dentry_has_perm() and
inode_has_perm() open-coded into it so that it can call
avc_has_perm_flags() in way that is safe if LOOKUP_RCU is set.

Calling avc_has_perm_flags() with rcu_read_lock() held means
that when avc_has_perm_noaudit calls avc_compute_av(), the attempt
to rcu_read_unlock() before calling security_compute_av() will not
actually drop the RCU read-lock.

However as security_compute_av() is completely in a read_lock()ed
region, it should be safe with the RCU read-lock held.
