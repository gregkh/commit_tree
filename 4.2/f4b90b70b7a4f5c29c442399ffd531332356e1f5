memcg: remove unused mem_cgroup->oom_wakeups

Since commit 4942642080ea ("mm: memcg: handle non-error OOM situations
more gracefully"), nobody uses mem_cgroup->oom_wakeups.  Remove it.

While at it, also fold memcg_wakeup_oom() into memcg_oom_recover() which
is its only user.  This cleanup was suggested by Michal.
