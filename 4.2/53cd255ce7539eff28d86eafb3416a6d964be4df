UBI: Use static class and attribute groups

This patch cleans up the manual device_create_file() or
class_create_file() calls by replacing with static attribute groups.
It simplifies the code and also avoids the possible races between the
device/class registration and sysfs creations.

For the simplification, also make ubi_class a static instance with
initializers, too.
