x86/kconfig: Reorganize arch feature Kconfig select's

Peter Zijstra noticed that in arch/x86/Kconfig there are a lot
of X86_{32,64} clauses in the X86 symbol, plus there are a number
of similar selects in the X86_32 and X86_64 config definitions
as well - which all overlap in an inconsistent mess.

So:

  - move all select's from X86_32 and X86_64 to the X64 config
    option

  - sort their names, so that duplications are easier to spot

  - align their if clauses, so that they are easier to identify
    at a glance - and so that weirdnesses stand out more

No change in functionality:
