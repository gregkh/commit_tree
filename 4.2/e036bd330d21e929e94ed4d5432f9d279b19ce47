pstore/ram: verify ramoops header before saving record

On some devices the persistent memory contains junk after a cold boot,
and /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-* are created with random data which is
not the result of a kernel crash.

This patch adds a ramoops header check and skips any
persistent_ram_zone that does not have a valid header.
