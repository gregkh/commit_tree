ASoC: tas2552: Configure the WCLK frequency based on the stream

Instead of hard wiring the WCLK frequency at probe time do it runtime.
The hard wired 88_96KHz was not even setting the correct bits since it was
defined as (1 << 6) which will  change the I2S_OUT_SEL bit and will leave
the amplifier configured for 8KHz.
At the same time clean up and fix the CFG3 register bits.
