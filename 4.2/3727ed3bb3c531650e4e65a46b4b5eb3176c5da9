ARM: dts: sun5i: Stop using different compatibles for ehci/ohci on a13 vs a10s

The A13 and the A10s use the same die (this has been confirmed by Allwinner),
as such there is no need to differentiate between the ehci/ohci parts of both,
the only reasons there were different allwinner,sun5i-a*-foo compatible
between these 2 parts is costemetically and because we could when we still
had 2 completely different dtsi files.

The allwinner,sun5i-a*-foo compatible strings are not used for binding at all,
the actual driver binds to the generic-?hci compatible, so we can safely remove
this cosmetical difference and simplify the dtsi files.
