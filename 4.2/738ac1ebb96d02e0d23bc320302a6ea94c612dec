net: Clone skb before setting peeked flag

Shared skbs must not be modified and this is crucial for broadcast
and/or multicast paths where we use it as an optimisation to avoid
unnecessary cloning.

The function skb_recv_datagram breaks this rule by setting peeked
without cloning the skb first.  This causes funky races which leads
to double-free.

This patch fixes this by cloning the skb and replacing the skb
in the list when setting skb->peeked.

Fixes: a59322be07c9 ("[UDP]: Only increment counter on first peek/recv")
