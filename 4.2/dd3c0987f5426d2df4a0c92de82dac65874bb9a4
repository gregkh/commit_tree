crypto: talitos - adapt interrupts and reset functions to SEC1

This patch adapts the interrupts handling and reset function for
SEC1. On SEC1, registers are almost similar to SEC2+, but bits
are sometimes located at different places. So we need to define
TALITOS1 and TALITOS2 versions of some fields, and manage according
to whether it is SEC1 or SEC2.

On SEC1, only one interrupt vector is dedicated to the SEC, so only
interrupt_4ch is needed.

On SEC1, interrupts are enabled by clearing related bits in IMR,
while on SEC2, interrupts are enabled by seting the bits in IMR.

SEC1 also performs parity verification in the DES Unit. We have
to disable this feature because the test vectors provided in
the kernel have parity errors.

In reset functions, only SEC2 supports continuation after error.
For SEC1, we have to reset in all cases.

For errors handling, SEC2+ names have been kept, but displayed
text have been amended to reflect exact meaning on SEC1.
