sock_diag: fetch source port from inet_sock

When an inet_sock is destroyed, its source port (sk_num) is set to
zero as part of the unhash procedure.  In order to supply a source
port as part of the NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG socket destruction broadcasts,
the source port number must be read from inet_sport instead.
