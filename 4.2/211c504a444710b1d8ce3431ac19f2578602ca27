net: dsa: Do not override PHY interface if already configured

In case we need to divert reads/writes using the slave MII bus, we may have
already fetched a valid PHY interface property from Device Tree, and that
mode is used by the PHY driver to make configuration decisions.

If we could not fetch the "phy-mode" property, we will assign p->phy_interface
to PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_NA, such that we can actually check for that condition as
to whether or not we should override the interface value.
