acpi-video-detect: Move acpi_is_video_device() to acpi/scan.c

This allows video_detect.c to be build as a module, this is a preparation
patch for the backlight interface selection logic cleanup.

Note this commit also causes acpi_is_video_device() to always be build
indepedent of CONFIG_ACPI_VIDEO, as there is no reason to make its
building depend on CONFIG_ACPI_VIDEO.
