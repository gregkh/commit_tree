watchdog: omap: use watchdog_init_timeout instead of open coding it

Instead of (partly) open coding watchdog_init_timeout to determine the
inital timeout use the core function that exists for exactly this
purpose.

As a side effect the "timeout-sec" device-tree property is recognized now
(though currently unused in the omap device trees).
