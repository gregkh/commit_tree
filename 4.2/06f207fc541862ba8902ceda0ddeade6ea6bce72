cfg80211: change GO_CONCURRENT to IR_CONCURRENT for STA

The GO_CONCURRENT regulatory definition can be extended to station
interfaces requesting to IR as part of TDLS off-channel operations.
Rename the GO_CONCURRENT flag to IR_CONCURRENT and allow the added
use-case.

Change internal users of GO_CONCURRENT to use the new definition.
