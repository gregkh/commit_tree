KVM: x86: Support for disabling quirks

Introducing KVM_CAP_DISABLE_QUIRKS for disabling x86 quirks that were previous
created in order to overcome QEMU issues. Those issue were mostly result of
invalid VM BIOS.  Currently there are two quirks that can be disabled:

1. KVM_QUIRK_LINT0_REENABLED - LINT0 was enabled after boot
2. KVM_QUIRK_CD_NW_CLEARED - CD and NW are cleared after boot

These two issues are already resolved in recent releases of QEMU, and would
therefore be disabled by QEMU.
