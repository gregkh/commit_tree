KEYS: ensure we free the assoc array edit if edit is valid

__key_link_end is not freeing the associated array edit structure
and this leads to a 512 byte memory leak each time an identical
existing key is added with add_key().

The reason the add_key() system call returns okay is that
key_create_or_update() calls __key_link_begin() before checking to see
whether it can update a key directly rather than adding/replacing - which
it turns out it can.  Thus __key_link() is not called through
__key_instantiate_and_link() and __key_link_end() must cancel the edit.
