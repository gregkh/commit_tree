ARCv2: add knob for DIV_REV in Kconfig

Being highly configurable core ARC HS among other features might be
configured with or without DIV_REM_OPTION (hardware divider).

That option when enabled adds following instructions: div, divu, rem, remu.

By default ARC HS38 has this option enabled. So we add here possibility
to disable usage of hardware divider by compiler.
