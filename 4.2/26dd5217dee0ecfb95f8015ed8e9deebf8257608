xfs: filter out sparse regions from individual inode allocation

Inode allocation from an existing record with free inodes traditionally
selects the first inode available according to the ir_free mask. With
sparse inode chunks, the ir_free mask could refer to an unallocated
region. We must mask the unallocated regions out of ir_free before using
it to select a free inode in the chunk.

Update the xfs_inobt_first_free_inode() helper to find the first free
inode available of the allocated regions of the inode chunk.
