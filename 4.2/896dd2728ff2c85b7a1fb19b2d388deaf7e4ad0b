ARM: dts: dove: Add proper support for Compulab CM-A510/SBC-A510

Existing dts file for Compulab CM-A510 was very limited due to missing
hardware. Now that we actually found somebody with that board, properly
rework it to provide a CoM/SoM include and a board file for Compulab's
SBC-A510.

Both the CM-A510 SoM and the SBC-A510 can be configured with different
options, so we only enable a minimum set of options. The actual board
configuration will have to be set by either the bootloader or user.

Although functionally not required, repeat even disabled nodes again
to increse their visibility in the dtsi/dts files.
