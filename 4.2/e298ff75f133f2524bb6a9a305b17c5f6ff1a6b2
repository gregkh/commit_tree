mm: initialize hotplugged pages as reserved

Commit 92923ca3aace ("mm: meminit: only set page reserved in the
memblock region") broke memory hotplug which expects the memmap for
newly added sections to be reserved until onlined by
online_pages_range().  This patch marks hotplugged pages as reserved
when adding new zones.
