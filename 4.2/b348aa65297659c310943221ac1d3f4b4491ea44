powerpc/spapr: vfio: Replace iommu_table with iommu_table_group

Modern IBM POWERPC systems support multiple (currently two) TCE tables
per IOMMU group (a.k.a. PE). This adds a iommu_table_group container
for TCE tables. Right now just one table is supported.

This defines iommu_table_group struct which stores pointers to
iommu_group and iommu_table(s). This replaces iommu_table with
iommu_table_group where iommu_table was used to identify a group:
- iommu_register_group();
- iommudata of generic iommu_group;

This removes @data from iommu_table as it_table_group provides
same access to pnv_ioda_pe.

For IODA, instead of embedding iommu_table, the new iommu_table_group
keeps pointers to those. The iommu_table structs are allocated
dynamically.

For P5IOC2, both iommu_table_group and iommu_table are embedded into
PE struct. As there is no EEH and SRIOV support for P5IOC2,
iommu_free_table() should not be called on iommu_table struct pointers
so we can keep it embedded in pnv_phb::p5ioc2.

For pSeries, this replaces multiple calls of kzalloc_node() with a new
iommu_pseries_alloc_group() helper and stores the table group struct
pointer into the pci_dn struct. For release, a iommu_table_free_group()
helper is added.

This moves iommu_table struct allocation from SR-IOV code to
the generic DMA initialization code in pnv_pci_ioda_setup_dma_pe and
pnv_pci_ioda2_setup_dma_pe as this is where DMA is actually initialized.
This change is here because those lines had to be changed anyway.

This should cause no behavioural change.
