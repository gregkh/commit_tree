[media] s5k5baf: Convert use of __constant_cpu_to_be16 to cpu_to_be16

In little endian cases, macro cpu_to_be16 unfolds to __swab16 which
provides special case for constants. In big endian cases,
__constant_cpu_to_be16 and cpu_to_be16 expand directly to the
same expression. So, replace __constant_cpu_to_be16 with
cpu_to_be16 with the goal of getting rid of the definition of
__constant_cpu_to_be16 completely.

The semantic patch that performs this transformation is as follows:

@@expression x;@@

- __constant_cpu_to_be16(x)
+ cpu_to_be16(x)
