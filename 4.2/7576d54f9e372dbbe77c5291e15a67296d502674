iwlwifi: mvm: don't stop regular scans when going out of idle state

It is not necessary to stop regular scans when going out of idle
state.  Previously, we were doing so for LMAC scans because the
iwl_mvm_scan_offload_stop() function was stopping both kinds of scans.
Now that we have more granularity, we can skip it.
