dell-laptop: Fix allocating & freeing SMI buffer page

This commit fix kernel crash when probing for rfkill devices in dell-laptop
driver failed. Function free_page() was incorrectly used on struct page *
instead of virtual address of SMI buffer.

This commit also simplify allocating page for SMI buffer by using
__get_free_page() function instead of sequential call of functions
alloc_page() and page_address().
