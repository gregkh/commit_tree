cpufreq: Avoid attempts to create duplicate symbolic links

After commit 87549141d516 (cpufreq: Stop migrating sysfs files on
hotplug) there is a problem with CPUs that share cpufreq policy
objects with other CPUs and are initially offline.

Say CPU1 shares a policy with CPU0 which is online and is registered
first.  As part of the registration process, cpufreq_add_dev() is
called for it.  It creates the policy object and a symbolic link
to it from the CPU1's sysfs directory.  If CPU1 is registered
subsequently and it is offline at that time, cpufreq_add_dev() will
attempt to create a symbolic link to the policy object for it, but
that link is present already, so a warning about that will be
triggered.

To avoid that warning, make cpufreq use an additional CPU mask
containing related CPUs that are actually present for each policy
object.  That mask is initialized when the policy object is populated
after its creation (for the first online CPU using it) and it includes
CPUs from the "policy CPUs" mask returned by the cpufreq driver's
->init() callback that are physically present at that time.  Symbolic
links to the policy are created only for the CPUs in that mask.

If cpufreq_add_dev() is invoked for an offline CPU, it checks the
new mask and only creates the symlink if the CPU was not in it (the
CPU is added to the mask at the same time).

In turn, cpufreq_remove_dev() drops the given CPU from the new mask,
removes its symlink to the policy object and returns, unless it is
the CPU owning the policy object.  In that case, the policy object
is moved to a new CPU's sysfs directory or deleted if the CPU being
removed was the last user of the policy.

While at it, notice that cpufreq_remove_dev() can't fail, because
its return value is ignored, so make it ignore return values from
__cpufreq_remove_dev_prepare() and __cpufreq_remove_dev_finish()
and prevent these functions from aborting on errors returned by
__cpufreq_governor().  Also drop the now unused sif argument from
them.
