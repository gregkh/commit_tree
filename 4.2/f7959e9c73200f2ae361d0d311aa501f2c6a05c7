net: rfkill: gpio: make better use of gpiod API

Since 39b2bbe3d715 (gpio: add flags argument to gpiod_get*() functions)
which appeared in v3.17-rc1, the gpiod_get* functions take an additional
parameter that allows to specify direction and initial value for output.

Furthermore there is devm_gpiod_get_optional which is designed to get
optional gpios.

Simplify driver accordingly.

Note this makes error checking more strict because only -ENOENT is
ignored when searching for the GPIOs which is good.
