ext4: replace open coded nofail allocation in ext4_free_blocks()

ext4_free_blocks is looping around the allocation request and mimics
__GFP_NOFAIL behavior without any allocation fallback strategy. Let's
remove the open coded loop and replace it with __GFP_NOFAIL. Without the
flag the allocator has no way to find out never-fail requirement and
cannot help in any way.
