mm/cma_debug: fix debugging alloc/free interface

CMA has alloc/free interface for debugging.  It is intended that
alloc/free occurs in specific CMA region, but, currently, alloc/free
interface is on root dir due to the bug so we can't select CMA region
where alloc/free happens.

This patch fixes this problem by making alloc/free interface per CMA
region.
