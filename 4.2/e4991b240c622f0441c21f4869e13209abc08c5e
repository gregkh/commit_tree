Revert 095bebf61a46 ("sched/numa: Do not move past the balance point if unbalanced")

Commit 095bebf61a46 ("sched/numa: Do not move past the balance point
if unbalanced") broke convergence of workloads with just one runnable
thread, by making it impossible for the one runnable thread on the
system to move from one NUMA node to another.

Instead, the thread would remain where it was, and pull all the memory
across to its location, which is much slower than just migrating the
thread to where the memory is.

The next patch has a better fix for the issue that 095bebf61a46 tried
to address.
