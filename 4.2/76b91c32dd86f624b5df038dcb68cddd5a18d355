bridge: stp: when using userspace stp stop kernel hello and hold timers

These should be handled only by the respective STP which is in control.
They become problematic for devices with limited resources with many
ports because the hold_timer is per port and fires each second and the
hello timer fires each 2 seconds even though it's global. While in
user-space STP mode these timers are completely unnecessary so it's better
to keep them off.
Also ensure that when the bridge is up these timers are started only when
running with kernel STP.
