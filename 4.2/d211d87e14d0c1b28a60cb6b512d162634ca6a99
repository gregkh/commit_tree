Revert "drm/nouveau/fifo/gk104: kick channels when deactivating them"

This reverts commit 1addc1264852

This commit seems to cause crashes in gk104_fifo_intr_runlist() by
returning 0xbad0da00 when register 0x2a00 is read. Since this commit was
intended for GM20B which is not completely supported yet, let's revert
it for the time being.
