pwm: Add pwmchip_add_with_polarity() API

Add a new function to register a PWM chip with channels that have their
initial polarity as specified by an additional parameter. This benefits
drivers of controllers that by default operate with inversed polarity
by removing the need to modify the polarity during initialization.
