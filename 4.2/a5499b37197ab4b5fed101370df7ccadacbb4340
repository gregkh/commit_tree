perf tools: Ensure thread-stack is flushed

The thread-stack represents a thread's current stack.  When a thread
exits there can still be many functions on the stack e.g. exit() can be
called many levels deep, so all the callers will never return.  To get
that information output, the thread-stack must be flushed.

Previously it was assumed the thread-stack would be flushed when the
struct thread was deleted.  With thread ref-counting it is no longer
clear when that will be, if ever. So instead explicitly flush all the
thread-stacks at the end of a session.
