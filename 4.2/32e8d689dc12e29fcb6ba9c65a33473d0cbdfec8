PM / sleep: trace_device_pm_callback coverage in dpm_prepare/complete

Move the trace_device_pm_callback locations for dpm_prepare and dpm_complete
to encompass the attempt to capture the device mutex prior to callback. This
is needed by analyze_suspend to identify gaps in the trace output caused by
the delay in locking the mutex for a device.
