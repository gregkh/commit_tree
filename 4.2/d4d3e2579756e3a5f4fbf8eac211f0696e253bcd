workqueue: ensure attrs changes are properly synchronized

Current modification to attrs via sysfs is not fully synchronized.

Process A (change cpumask)      | Process B (change numa affinity)
wq_cpumask_store()              |
  wq_sysfs_prep_attrs()         |
                                | apply_workqueue_attrs()
  apply_workqueue_attrs()       |

It results that the Process B's operation is totally reverted
without any notification, it is a buggy behavior.  So this patch
moves wq_sysfs_prep_attrs() into the protection under wq_pool_mutex
to ensure attrs changes are properly synchronized.
