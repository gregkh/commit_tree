x86/fpu: Rename unlazy_fpu() to fpu__save()

This function is a misnomer on two levels:

1) it doesn't really manipulate TS on modern CPUs anymore, its
   primary purpose is to save FPU state, used:

      - when executing fork()/clone(): to copy current FPU state
        to the child's FPU state.

      - when handling math exceptions: to generate the math error
        si_code in the signal frame.

2) even on legacy CPUs it doesn't actually 'unlazy', if then
   it lazies the FPU state: as a side effect of the old FNSAVE
   instruction which clears (destroys) FPU state it's necessary
   to set CR0::TS.

So rename it to fpu__save() to better reflect its purpose.
