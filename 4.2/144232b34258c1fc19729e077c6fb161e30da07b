blkcg: blkcg_css_alloc() should grab blkcg_pol_mutex while iterating blkcg_policy[]

An entry in blkcg_policy[] is stable while there are non-bypassing
in-flight IOs on a request_queue which has the policy activated.  This
is why most derefs of blkcg_policy[] don't need explicit locking;
however, blkcg_css_alloc() isn't invoked from IO path and thus doesn't
have this protection and may race policies being added and removed.

Fix it by adding explicit blkcg_pol_mutex protection around
blkcg_policy[] iteration in blkcg_css_alloc().
