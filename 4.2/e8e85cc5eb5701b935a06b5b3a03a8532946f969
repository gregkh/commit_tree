packet: remove handling of tx_ring

Remove handling of tx_ring in prb_setup_retire_blk_timer
for TPACKET_V3 because init_prb_bdqc is called only for zero tx_ring
and thus prb_setup_retire_blk_timer for zero tx_ring only.

And also in functon init_prb_bdqc there is no usage of tx_ring.
Thus removing tx_ring from init_prb_bdqc.
