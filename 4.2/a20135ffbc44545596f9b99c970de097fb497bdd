writeback: don't drain bdi_writeback_congested on bdi destruction

52ebea749aae ("writeback: make backing_dev_info host cgroup-specific
bdi_writebacks") made bdi (backing_dev_info) host per-cgroup wb's
(bdi_writeback's).  As the congested state needs to be per-wb and
referenced from blkcg side and multiple wbs, the patch made all
non-root cong's (bdi_writeback_congested's) reference counted and
indexed on bdi.

When a bdi is destroyed, cgwb_bdi_destroy() tries to drain all
non-root cong's; however, this can hang indefinitely because wb's can
also be referenced from blkcg_gq's which are destroyed after bdi
destruction is complete.

This patch fixes the bug by updating bdi destruction to not wait for
cong's to drain.  A cong is unlinked from bdi->cgwb_congested_tree on
bdi destuction regardless of its reference count as the bdi may go
away any point after destruction.  wb_congested_put() checks whether
the cong is already unlinked on release.
