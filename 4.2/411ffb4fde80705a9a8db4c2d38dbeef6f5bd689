netfilter: bridge: refactor frag_max_size

Currently frag_max_size is member of br_input_skb_cb and copied back and
forth using IPCB(skb) and BR_INPUT_SKB_CB(skb) each time it is changed or
used.

Attach frag_max_size to nf_bridge_info and set value in pre_routing and
forward functions. Use its value in forward and xmit functions.
