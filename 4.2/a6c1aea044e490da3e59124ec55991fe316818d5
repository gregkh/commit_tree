cls_u32: complete the check for non-forced case in u32_destroy()

In commit 1e052be69d04 ("net_sched: destroy proto tp when all filters are gone")
I added a check in u32_destroy() to see if all real filters are gone
for each tp, however, that is only done for root_ht, same is needed
for others.

This can be reproduced by the following tc commands:

tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:0 prio 5 handle 15: protocol ip u32 divisor 256
tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ip parent 1: prio 5 handle 15:2:2 u32
ht 15:2: match ip src 10.0.0.2 flowid 1:10
tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ip parent 1: prio 5 handle 15:2:3 u32
ht 15:2: match ip src 10.0.0.3 flowid 1:10
