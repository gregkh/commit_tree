Drivers: hv: vmbus: distribute subchannels among all vcpus

Primary channels are distributed evenly across all vcpus we have. When the host
asks us to create subchannels it usually makes us num_cpus-1 offers and we are
supposed to distribute the work evenly among the channel itself and all its
subchannels. Make sure they are all assigned to different vcpus.
