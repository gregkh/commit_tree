sfc: protect filter table against use-after-free

If MCDI timeouts are encountered during efx_ef10_filter_table_remove(),
an FLR will be queued, but efx->filter_state will still be kfree()d.
The queued FLR will then call efx_ef10_filter_table_restore(), which
will try to use efx->filter_state. This previously caused a panic.
This patch adds an rwsem to protect the existence of efx->filter_state,
separately from the spinlock protecting its contents.  Users which can
race against efx_ef10_filter_table_remove() should down_read this rwsem.
