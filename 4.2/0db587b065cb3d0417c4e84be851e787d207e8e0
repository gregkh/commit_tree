qeth: IFF_PROMISC flag to BRIDGE PORT mode

OSA and HiperSocket devices do not support promiscuous mode proper,
but they support "BRIDGE PORT" mode that is functionally similar.
This update introduces sysfs attribute that, when set, makes the driver
try to "reflect" setting and resetting of the IFF_PROMISC flag on the
interface into setting and resetting PRIMARY or SECONDARY bridge port
role on the underlying OSA or HiperSocket device.
