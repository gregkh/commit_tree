checkpatch: improve output with multiple command-line files

If there are multiple patches/files on the command line,
use a prefix before the patch/file message output like:
        --------------
        patch/filename
        --------------
to make the identifying which messages go with which
file/patch a bit easier to parse.

Move the perl version and false positive messages after
all the files have been scanned so that they are emitted
only once.

Standardize the NOTE: <...> form to always emit a blank
line before the NOTE and always use print << "EOM" style.
