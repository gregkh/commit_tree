KVM: add "new" argument to kvm_arch_commit_memory_region

This lets the function access the new memory slot without going through
kvm_memslots and id_to_memslot.  It will simplify the code when more
than one address space will be supported.

Unfortunately, the "const"ness of the new argument must be casted
away in two places.  Fixing KVM to accept const struct kvm_memory_slot
pointers would require modifications in pretty much all architectures,
and is left for later.
