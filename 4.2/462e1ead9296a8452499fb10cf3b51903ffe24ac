bridge: vlan: fix usage of vlan 0 and 4095 again

Vlan ids 0 and 4095 were disallowed by commit:
8adff41c3d25 ("bridge: Don't use VID 0 and 4095 in vlan filtering")
but then the check was removed when vlan ranges were introduced by:
bdced7ef7838 ("bridge: support for multiple vlans and vlan ranges in setlink and dellink requests")
So reintroduce the vlan range check.
Before patch:
[root@testvm ~]# bridge vlan add vid 0 dev eth0 master
(succeeds)
After Patch:
[root@testvm ~]# bridge vlan add vid 0 dev eth0 master
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
