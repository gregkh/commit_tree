perf stat: Fix transaction lenght metrics

The transaction length metrics in perf stat -T broke recently.

It would not match the metric correctly and always print K/sec.

This was caused by a incorrect update of the cycles_in_tx statistics.

Update the correct variable.

Also the check for zero division was reversed, which resulted in K/sec
being printed for no transactions. Fix this also up.
