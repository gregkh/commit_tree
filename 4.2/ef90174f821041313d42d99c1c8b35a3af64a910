watchdog: watchdog_core: Add watchdog registration deferral mechanism

Currently, watchdog subsystem require the misc subsystem to
register a watchdog. This may not be the case in case of an
early registration of a watchdog, which can be required when
the watchdog cannot be disabled.

This patch introduces a deferral mechanism to remove this requirement.
