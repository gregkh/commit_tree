staging: board: Add support for translating hwirq to virq numbers

As of commit 9a1091ef0017c40a ("irqchip: gic: Support hierarchy irq
domain."), GIC IRQ numbers are virtual, breaking hardcoded hardware IRQ
numbers in platform device resources.

Add support for translating hardware IRQ numbers to virtual IRQ numbers,
and fixing up platform device resources with hardcoded IRQ numbers.
