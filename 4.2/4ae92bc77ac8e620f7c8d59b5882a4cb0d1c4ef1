net: filter: add a callback to allow classic post-verifier transformations

This is in preparation for use by the seccomp code, the rationale is
not to duplicate additional code within the seccomp layer, but instead,
have it abstracted and hidden within the classic BPF API.

As an interim step, this now also makes bpf_prepare_filter() visible
(not as exported symbol though), so that seccomp can reuse that code
path instead of reimplementing it.

Joint work with Daniel Borkmann.
