namei: we never need more than MAXSYMLINKS entries in nd->stack

The only reason why we needed one more was that purely nested
MAXSYMLINKS symlinks could lead to path_init() using that many
entries in addition to nd->stack[0] which it left unused.

That can't happen now - path_init() starts with entry 0 (and
trailing_symlink() is called only when we'd already encountered
one symlink, so no more than MAXSYMLINKS-1 are left).
