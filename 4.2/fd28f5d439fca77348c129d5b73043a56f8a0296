arm64: Don't report clear pmds and puds as huge

The current pmd_huge() and pud_huge() functions simply check if the table
bit is not set and reports the entries as huge in that case.  This is
counter-intuitive as a clear pmd/pud cannot also be a huge pmd/pud, and
it is inconsistent with at least arm and x86.

To prevent others from making the same mistake as me in looking at code
that calls these functions and to fix an issue with KVM on arm64 that
causes memory corruption due to incorrect page reference counting
resulting from this mistake, let's change the behavior.
