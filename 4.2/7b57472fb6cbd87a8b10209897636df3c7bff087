ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: enable asm and NEON accelerated crypto modules

Enable all drivers under CONFIG_ARM_CRYPTO as modules. Enable
CONFIG_KERNEL_MODE_NEON as well so that the modules that either
contain a NEON alternative or consist solely of a NEON (or ARMv8
crypto extensions) accelerated implementation are enabled fully as
well.

Note that the ARMv8 modules will only be built if the detected
toolchain version is recent enough (binutils 2.23 or higher).
