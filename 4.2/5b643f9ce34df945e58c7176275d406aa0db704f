ext4 crypto: optimize filename encryption

Encrypt the filename as soon it is passed in by the user.  This avoids
our needing to encrypt the filename 2 or 3 times while in the process
of creating a filename.

Similarly, when looking up a directory entry, encrypt the filename
early, or if the encryption key is not available, base-64 decode the
file syystem so that the hash value and the last 16 bytes of the
encrypted filename is available in the new struct ext4_filename data
structure.
