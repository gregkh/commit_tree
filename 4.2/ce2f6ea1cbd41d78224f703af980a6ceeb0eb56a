spi: orion: Fix maximum baud rates for Armada 370/XP

The commit df59fa7f4bca "spi: orion: support armada extended baud
rates" was too optimistic for the maximum baud rate that the Armada
SoCs can support. According to the hardware datasheet the maximum
frequency supported by the Armada 370 SoC is tclk/4. But for the
Armada XP, Armada 38x and Armada 39x SoCs the limitation is 50MHz and
for the Armada 375 it is tclk/15.

Currently the armada-370-spi compatible is only used by the Armada 370
and the Armada XP device tree. On Armada 370, tclk cannot be higher
than 200MHz. In order to be able to handle both SoCs, we can take the
minimum of 50MHz and tclk/4.

A proper solution is adding a compatible string for each SoC, but it
can't be done as a fix for compatibility reason (we can't modify
device tree that have been already released) and it will be part of a
separate patch.
