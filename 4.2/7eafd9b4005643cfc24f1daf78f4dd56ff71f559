hv_netvsc: use per_cpu stats to calculate TX/RX data

Current code does not lock anything when calculating the TX and RX stats.
As a result, the RX and TX data reported by ifconfig are not accuracy in a
system with high network throughput and multiple CPUs (in my test,
RX/TX = 83% between 2 HyperV VM nodes which have 8 vCPUs and 40G Ethernet).

This patch fixed the above issue by using per_cpu stats.
netvsc_get_stats64() summarizes TX and RX data by iterating over all CPUs
to get their respective stats.

This v2 patch addressed David's comments on the cleanup path when
netdev_alloc_pcpu_stats() failed.
