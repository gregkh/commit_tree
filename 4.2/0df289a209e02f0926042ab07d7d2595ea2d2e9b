[media] dvb: Get rid of typedev usage for enums

The DVB API was originally defined using typedefs. This is against
Kernel CodingStyle, and there's no good usage here. While we can't
remove its usage on userspace, we can avoid its usage in Kernelspace.

So, let's do it.

This patch was generated by this shell script:

	for j in $(grep typedef include/uapi/linux/dvb/frontend.h |cut -d' ' -f 3); do for i in $(find drivers/media -name '*.[ch]' -type f) $(find drivers/staging/media -name '*.[ch]' -type f); do sed "s,${j}_t,enum $j," <$i >a && mv a $i; done; done

While here, make CodingStyle fixes on the affected lines.
