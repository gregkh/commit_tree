iio: mlx90614: Add emissivity setting

The mapping from the 16-bit EEPROM value to the decimal 0-1 range is
approximate.  A special case ensures 0xFFFF shows as 1.0 instead of
0.999998565.

Writing to EEPROM requires an explicit erase by writing zero.  In
addition, it takes 20ms for the erase/write to complete.  During this
time no EEPROM register should be accessed.  Therefore, two msleep()s
are added to the write function and a mutex protects against concurrent
access.
