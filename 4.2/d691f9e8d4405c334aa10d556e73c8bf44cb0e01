bpf: allow programs to write to certain skb fields

allow programs read/write skb->mark, tc_index fields and
((struct qdisc_skb_cb *)cb)->data.

mark and tc_index are generically useful in TC.
cb[0]-cb[4] are primarily used to pass arguments from one
program to another called via bpf_tail_call() which can
be seen in sockex3_kern.c example.

All fields of 'struct __sk_buff' are readable to socket and tc_cls_act progs.
mark, tc_index are writeable from tc_cls_act only.
cb[0]-cb[4] are writeable by both sockets and tc_cls_act.

Add verifier tests and improve sample code.
