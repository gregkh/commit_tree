ASoC: qcom: move ipq806x specific bits out of lpass driver.

This patch tries to make the lpass driver more generic by moving the
ipq806x specific bits out of the cpu and platform driver, also allows the
SOC specific drivers to add the correct register offsets.

This patch also renames the register definition header file into more
generic header file.
