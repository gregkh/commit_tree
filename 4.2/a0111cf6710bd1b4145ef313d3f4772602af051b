workqueue: separate out and refactor the locking of applying attrs

Applying attrs requires two locks: get_online_cpus() and wq_pool_mutex,
and this code is duplicated at two places (apply_workqueue_attrs() and
workqueue_set_unbound_cpumask()).  So we separate out this locking
code into apply_wqattrs_[un]lock() and do a minor refactor on
apply_workqueue_attrs().

The apply_wqattrs_[un]lock() will be also used on later patch for
ensuring attrs changes are properly synchronized.
