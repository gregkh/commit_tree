crypto: poly1305 - Add a generic Poly1305 authenticator implementation

Poly1305 is a fast message authenticator designed by Daniel J. Bernstein.
It is further defined in RFC7539 as a building block for the ChaCha20-Poly1305
AEAD for use in IETF protocols.

This is a portable C implementation of the algorithm without architecture
specific optimizations, based on public domain code by Daniel J. Bernstein and
Andrew Moon.
