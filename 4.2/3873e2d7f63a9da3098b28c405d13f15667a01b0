drivers: PL011: refactor pl011_probe()

Currently the pl011_probe() function is relying on some AMBA IDs
and a device tree node to initialize the driver and a port.
Both features are not necessarily required for the driver:
- we lack AMBA IDs in the ARM SBSA generic UART and
- we lack a DT node in ACPI systems.
So lets refactor the function to ease later reuse.
