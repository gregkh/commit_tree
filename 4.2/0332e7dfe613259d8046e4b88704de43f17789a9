Is an Allwinner A10s based hdmi tv stick with with 512M RAM, 4G nand flash,
toc9002 (bcm43362) sdio wifi, 1 USB host ports using an USB-A receptacle and
a 2 micro-usb receptacles, one for power and one for USB OTG.

The sdio wifi appears to not have an oob irq hooked up, so we rely on sdio-irq
support for it.
