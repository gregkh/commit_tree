udp: fix dst races with multicast early demux

Multicast dst are not cached. They carry DST_NOCACHE.

As mentioned in commit f8864972126899 ("ipv4: fix dst race in
sk_dst_get()"), these dst need special care before caching them
into a socket.

Caching them is allowed only if their refcnt was not 0, ie we
must use atomic_inc_not_zero()

Also, we must use READ_ONCE() to fetch sk->sk_rx_dst, as mentioned
in commit d0c294c53a771 ("tcp: prevent fetching dst twice in early demux
code")
