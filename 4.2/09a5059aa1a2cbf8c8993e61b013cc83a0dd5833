tracing: Rename ftrace_trigger_soft_disabled() to trace_trigger_soft_disabled()

The name "ftrace" really refers to the function hook infrastructure. It
is not about the trace_events. The ftrace_trigger_soft_disabled() tests if a
trace_event is soft disabled (called but not traced), and returns true if
it is. It has nothing to do with function tracing and should be renamed.
