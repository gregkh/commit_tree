dmaengine: fix balance of privatecnt inc/dec operations

This patch increments privatecnt value and set DMA_PRIVATE in device
caps in dma_request_slave_channel() function. This is needed to keep
privatecnt increment/decrement balance.

As function dma_release_channel() decrements privatecnt counter, we need
to increment it when channel is requested. Otherwise privatecnt drops
into negatives after few dma_release_channel() calls.
