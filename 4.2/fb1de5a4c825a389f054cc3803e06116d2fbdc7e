staging: lustre: Include unaligned.h instead of access_ok.h

Including access_ok.h causes the ia64:allmodconfig build (and maybe others)
to fail with

include/linux/unaligned/le_struct.h:6:19: error:
	redefinition of 'get_unaligned_le16'
include/linux/unaligned/access_ok.h:7:19: note:
	previous definition of 'get_unaligned_le16' was here
include/linux/unaligned/le_struct.h:26:20: error:
	redefinition of 'put_unaligned_le32'
include/linux/unaligned/access_ok.h:42:20: note:
	previous definition of 'put_unaligned_le32' was here
include/linux/unaligned/le_struct.h:31:20: error:
	redefinition of 'put_unaligned_le64'
include/linux/unaligned/access_ok.h:47:20: note:
	previous definition of 'put_unaligned_le64' was here

Include unaligned.h instead and leave it up to the architecture to decide
how to implement unaligned accesses.
