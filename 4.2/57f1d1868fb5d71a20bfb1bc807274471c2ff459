tipc: rename functions defined in subscr.c

When a topology server accepts a connection request from its client,
it allocates a connection instance and a tipc_subscriber structure
object. The former is used to communicate with client, and the latter
is often treated as a subscriber which manages all subscription events
requested from a same client. When a topology server receives a request
of subscribing name services from a client through the connection, it
creates a tipc_subscription structure instance which is seen as a
subscription recording what name services are subscribed. In order to
manage all subscriptions from a same client, topology server links
them into the subscrp_list of the subscriber. So subscriber and
subscription completely represents different meanings respectively,
but function names associated with them make us so confused that we
are unable to easily tell which function is against subscriber and
which is to subscription. So we want to eliminate the confusion by
renaming them.
