rcu: Convert CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_EXACT to boot parameter

The CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_EXACT Kconfig parameter is used primarily (and
perhaps only) by rcutorture to verify that RCU works correctly in specific
rcu_node combining-tree configurations.  It therefore does not make
much sense have this as a question to people attempting to configure
their kernels.  So this commit creates an rcutree.rcu_fanout_exact=
boot parameter that rcutorture can use, and eliminates the original
CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_EXACT Kconfig parameter.
