writeback: add dirty_throttle_control->wb_completions

wb->completions measures the wb's proportional write bandwidth in
global_wb_domain and thus naturally tied to the wb_domain.  This patch
adds dirty_throttle_control->wb_completions which is initialized to
wb->completions by GDTC_INIT() and updates __wb_dirty_limits() to use
it instead of dereferencing wb->completions directly.

This will allow dirty_throttle_control to represent different
wb_domains and the matching wb completions.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavioral changes.
