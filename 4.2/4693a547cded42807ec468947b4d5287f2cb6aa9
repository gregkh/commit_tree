namei: new calling conventions for walk_component()

instead of a single flag (!= 0 => we want to follow symlinks) pass
two bits - WALK_GET (want to follow symlinks) and WALK_PUT (put_link()
once we are done looking at the name).  The latter matters only for
success exits - on failure the caller will discard everything anyway.

Suggestions for better variant are welcome; what this thing aims for
is making sure that pending put_link() is done *before* walk_component()
decides to pick a symlink up, rather than between picking it up and
acting upon it.  See the next commit for payoff.
