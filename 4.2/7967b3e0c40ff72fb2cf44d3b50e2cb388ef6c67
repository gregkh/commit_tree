tracing: Rename struct ftrace_subsystem_dir to trace_subsystem_dir

The name "ftrace" really refers to the function hook infrastructure. It
is not about the trace_events. The structure ftrace_subsystem_dir holds
the information about trace event subsystems. It should not be named
ftrace, rename it to trace_subsystem_dir.
