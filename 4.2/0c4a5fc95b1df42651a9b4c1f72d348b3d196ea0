selftests: timers: Add leap-second timer edge testing to leap-a-day.c

Prarit reported an issue w/ timers around the leapsecond, where a
timer set for Midnight UTC (00:00:00) might fire a second early right
before the leapsecond (23:59:60 - though it appears as a repeated
23:59:59) is applied.

So I've updated the leap-a-day.c test to integrate a similar test,
where we set a timer and check if it triggers at the right time, and
if the ntp state transition is managed properly.
