Btrfs: wake up extent state waiters on unlock through clear_extent_bits

When we clear an extent state's EXTENT_LOCKED bit with clear_extent_bits()
through free_io_failure(), we weren't waking up any tasks waiting for the
extent's state EXTENT_LOCKED bit, leading to an hang.

So make sure clear_extent_bits() ends up waking up any waiters if the
bit EXTENT_LOCKED is supplied by its callers.

Zygo Blaxell was experiencing such hangs at inode eviction time after
file unlinks. Thanks to him for a set of scripts to reproduce the issue.
