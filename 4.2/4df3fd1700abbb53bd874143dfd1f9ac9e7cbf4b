ALSA: hda - Fix the dock headphone output on Fujitsu Lifebook E780

Fujitsu Lifebook E780 sets the sequence number 0x0f to only only of
the two headphones, thus the driver tries to assign another as the
line-out, and this results in the inconsistent mapping between the
created jack ctl and the actual I/O.  Due to this, PulseAudio doesn't
handle it properly and gets the silent output.

The fix is to ignore the non-HP sequencer checks.
