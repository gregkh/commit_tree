workqueue: Allow modifying low level unbound workqueue cpumask

Allow to modify the low-level unbound workqueues cpumask through
sysfs. This is performed by traversing the entire workqueue list
and calling apply_wqattrs_prepare() on the unbound workqueues
with the new low level mask. Only after all the preparation are done,
we commit them all together.

Ordered workqueues are ignored from the low level unbound workqueue
cpumask, it will be handled in near future.

All the (default & per-node) pwqs are mandatorily controlled by
the low level cpumask. If the user configured cpumask doesn't overlap
with the low level cpumask, the low level cpumask will be used for the
wq instead.

The comment of wq_calc_node_cpumask() is updated and explicitly
requires that its first argument should be the attrs of the default
pwq.

The default wq_unbound_cpumask is cpu_possible_mask.  The workqueue
subsystem doesn't know its best default value, let the system manager
or the other subsystem set it when needed.

Changed from V8:
  merge the calculating code for the attrs of the default pwq together.
  minor change the code&comments for saving the user configured attrs.
  remove unnecessary list_del().
  minor update the comment of wq_calc_node_cpumask().
  update the comment of workqueue_set_unbound_cpumask();
