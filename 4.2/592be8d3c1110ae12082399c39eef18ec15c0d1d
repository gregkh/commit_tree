pinctrl: sh-pfc: Remove r8a73a4 platform_device_id entry

As of commit 9d07d414d4c33d86 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: ape6evm: Remove
legacy platform"), r8a73a4 is only supported in generic DT-only ARM
multi-platform builds.  The driver doesn't need to match platform
devices by name anymore, hence remove the corresponding
platform_device_id entry.
