rcu: Make rcu_*_data variables static

rcu_bh_data, rcu_sched_data and rcu_preempt_data are never used outside
kernel/rcu/tree.c and thus can be made static.

Doing so fixes a section mismatch warning reported by clang when
building LLVMLinux with -Wsection, because these variables were declared
in .data..percpu and defined in .data..percpu..shared_aligned since
commit 11bbb235c26f ("rcu: Use DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED for
rcu_data").
