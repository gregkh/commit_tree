cfq-iosched: fix other locations where blkcg_to_cfqgd() can return NULL

Commit 9470e4a693db only covered the initial bug report, there are
other spots in CFQ where we need to check that we actually have
a valid cfq_group_data structure.

Fixes: e48453c3 ("block, cgroup: implement policy-specific per-blkcg data")
