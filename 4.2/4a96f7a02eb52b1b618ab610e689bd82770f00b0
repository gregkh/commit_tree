perf tools: Add support for PERF_RECORD_AUX

Add support for the PERF_RECORD_AUX event type.

PERF_RECORD_AUX is a new kernel event that records when new data lands
in the AUX buffer. Currently it is assumed that AUX data follows the
same ring buffer conventions used by the perf events buffer, and
consequently the AUX event is not processed during recording.

It is processed during session processing so that the information in the
'flags' member is made available.

The format of PERF_RECORD_AUX is outlined in the linux/perf_events.h
header file. The 'flags' are also enumerated.

Intel PT and Intel BTS use the flag named PERF_AUX_FLAG_TRUNCATED to
determine if data has been lost because the buffer became full as perf
was not able to empty it fast enough.
