rcutorture: Test SRCU cleanup code path

The current rcutorture testing does not do any cleanup operations.
This works because the srcu_struct is statically allocated, but it
does represent a memory leak of the associated dynamically allocated
->per_cpu_ref per-CPU variables.  However, rcutorture currently uses
a statically allocated srcu_struct, which cannot legally be passed to
cleanup_srcu_struct().  Therefore, this commit adds a second form
of srcu (called srcud) that dynamically allocates and frees the
associated per-CPU variables.  This commit also adds a ->cleanup()
member to rcu_torture_ops that is invoked at the end of the test,
after ->cb_barriers().  This ->cleanup() pointer is NULL for all
existing tests, and thus only used for scrud.  Finally, the SRCU-P
torture-test configuration selects scrud instead of srcu, with SRCU-N
continuing to use srcu, thereby testing both static and dynamic
srcu_struct structures.
