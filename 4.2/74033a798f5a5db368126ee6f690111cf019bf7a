mm: meminit: remove mminit_verify_page_links

mminit_verify_page_links() is an extremely paranoid check that was
introduced when memory initialisation was being heavily reworked.
Profiles indicated that up to 10% of parallel memory initialisation was
spent on checking this for every page.  The cost could be reduced but in
practice this check only found problems very early during the
initialisation rewrite and has found nothing since.  This patch removes an
expensive unnecessary check.
