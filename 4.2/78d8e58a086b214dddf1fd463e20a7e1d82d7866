Revert "block, dm: don't copy bios for request clones"

This reverts commit 5f1b670d0bef508a5554d92525f5f6d00d640b38.

Justification for revert as reported in this dm-devel post:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2015-June/msg00160.html

this change should not be pushed to mainline yet.

Firstly, Christoph has a newer version of the patch that fixes silent
data corruption problem:
  https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2015-May/msg00229.html

And the new version still depends on LLDDs to always complete requests
to the end when error happens, while block API doesn't enforce such a
requirement. If the assumption is ever broken, the inconsistency between
request and bio (e.g. rq->__sector and rq->bio) will cause silent data
corruption:
