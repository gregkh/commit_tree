etherdev: Avoid unnecessary byte swap in check for Ethertype

This change takes advantage of the fact that ETH_P_802_3_MIN is aligned to
512 so as a result we can actually ignore the lower 8b when comparing the
Ethertype to ETH_P_802_3_MIN.  This allows us to avoid a byte swap by simply
masking the value and comparing it to the byte swapped value for
ETH_P_802_3_MIN.
