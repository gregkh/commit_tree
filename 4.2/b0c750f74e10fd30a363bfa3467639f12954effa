staging: board: Initialize staging board code earlier

Currently the staging board code is initialized from a late_initcall().
However, unused PM domains are also disabled from a late_initcall(),
which happens before due to link order.

Change the initialization of staging board code from using
late_initcall() to device_initcall() to fix this.
