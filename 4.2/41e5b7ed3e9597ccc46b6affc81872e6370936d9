ext4: verify block bitmap even after fresh initialization

If we want to rely on the buffer_verified() flag of the block bitmap
buffer, we have to set it consistently. However currently if we're
initializing uninitialized block bitmap in
ext4_read_block_bitmap_nowait() we're not going to set buffer verified
at all.

We can do this by simply setting the flag on the buffer, but I think
it's actually better to run ext4_validate_block_bitmap() to make sure
that what we did in the ext4_init_block_bitmap() is right.

So run ext4_validate_block_bitmap() even after the block bitmap
initialization. Also bail out early from ext4_validate_block_bitmap() if
we see corrupt bitmap, since we already know it's corrupt and we do not
need to verify that.
