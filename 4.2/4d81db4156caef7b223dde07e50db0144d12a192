rocker: fix neigh tbl index increment race

rocker->neigh_tbl_next_index is used to generate unique indices for neigh
entries programmed into the device.  The way new indices were generated was
racy with the new prepare-commit transaction model.  A simple fix here
removes the race.  The race was with two processes getting the same index,
one process using prepare-commit, the other not:

Proc A					Proc B

PREPARE phase
get neigh_tbl_next_index

					NONE phase
					get neigh_tbl_next_index
					neigh_tbl_next_index++

COMMIT phase
neigh_tbl_next_index++

Both A and B got the same index.  The fix is to store and increment
neigh_tbl_next_index in the PREPARE (or NONE) phase and use value in COMMIT
phase:

Proc A					Proc B

PREPARE phase
get neigh_tbl_next_index
neigh_tbl_next_index++

					NONE phase
					get neigh_tbl_next_index
					neigh_tbl_next_index++

COMMIT phase
// use value stashed in PREPARE phase
