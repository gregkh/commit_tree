ip: report the original address of ICMP messages

ICMP messages can trigger ICMP and local errors. In this case
serr->port is 0 and starting from Linux 4.0 we do not return
the original target address to the error queue readers.
Add function to define which errors provide addr_offset.
With this fix my ping command is not silent anymore.
