ima: pass iint to ima_add_violation()

This patch adds the iint associated to the current inode as a new
parameter of ima_add_violation(). The passed iint is always not NULL
if a violation is detected. This modification will be used to determine
the inode for which there is a violation.

Since the 'd' and 'd-ng' template field init() functions were detecting
a violation from the value of the iint pointer, they now check the new
field 'violation', added to the 'ima_event_data' structure.
