iio: magn: bmc150_magn: add oversampling ratio

Export the oversampling ratio so that the user can change the
number of repetions for x/y/z axis.

The sampling frequency is limited by the oversampling ratio.
The available sampling frequencies might change depending
on the values of oversampling_ratio.

The specification can be downloaded from:
