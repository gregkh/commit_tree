isdn/gigaset: reset tty->receive_room when attaching ser_gigaset

Commit 79901317ce80 ("n_tty: Don't flush buffer when closing ldisc"),
first merged in kernel release 3.10, caused the following regression
in the Gigaset M101 driver:

Before that commit, when closing the N_TTY line discipline in
preparation to switching to N_GIGASET_M101, receive_room would be
reset to a non-zero value by the call to n_tty_flush_buffer() in
n_tty's close method. With the removal of that call, receive_room
might be left at zero, blocking data reception on the serial line.

The present patch fixes that regression by setting receive_room
to an appropriate value in the ldisc open method.
