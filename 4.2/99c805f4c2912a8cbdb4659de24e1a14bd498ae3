staging: unisys: s-Par video channel includes EFI framebuffer

The efi framebuffer is defined within the s-Par video channel
console. Before we get the device create message for the video
console, s-Par has alreaady informed linux about the efi
framebuffer and a memory region is already set up for it. Since
we do not use the video channel in linux, we are just ignoring
the failure of the video channel request_mem_region.

Testing: This patch was tested on top of s-Par and we no longer
leave the partition in a failed state.
