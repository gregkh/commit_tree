rcu: Remove dead code from force_qs_rnp()

Because force_qs_rnp() is invoked only from the force-quiescent-state
code which runs only in the context of the grace-period kthread, a grace
period must always be in progress throughout force_qs_rnp()'s execution.
This commit therefore removes the rcu_gp_in_progress() check and the
associated dead code.
