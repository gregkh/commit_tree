drm/i915: Adjust sideband locking a bit for CHV/VLV

chv_enable_pll() doesn't need to hold sb_lock for the entire duration of
the function. Drop the lock as soon as possible.

valleyview_set_cdclk() does a potential lock+unlock+lock+unlock cycle
with sb_lock. Grab the lock a few lines earlier so we can make do
with a single lock+unlock cycle always.
