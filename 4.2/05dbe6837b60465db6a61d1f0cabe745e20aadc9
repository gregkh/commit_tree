Btrfs: unify subvol= and subvolid= mounting

Currently, mounting a subvolume with subvolid= takes a different code
path than mounting with subvol=. This isn't really a big deal except for
the fact that mounts done with subvolid= or the default subvolume don't
have a dentry that's connected to the dentry tree like in the subvol=
case. To unify the code paths, when given subvolid= or using the default
subvolume ID, translate it into a subvolume name by walking
ROOT_BACKREFs in the root tree and INODE_REFs in the filesystem trees.
