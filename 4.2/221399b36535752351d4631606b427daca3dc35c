HID: sony: Simplify LED initialization and eliminate redundant copies when updating LED states

Directly set the initial LED states in the device state struct instead
of copying them from a temporary array.

This allows for the removal of a redundant "x = x" copy loop in
sony_set_leds() that was taking place any time an LED was updated.

It also allows for the simplifying of the parameters in functions dealing
with LED initialization and updates since only a pointer to the sony_sc
struct is needed now.
