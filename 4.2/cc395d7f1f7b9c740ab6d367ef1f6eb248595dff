writeback: implement bdi_wait_for_completion()

If the completion of a wb_writeback_work can be waited upon by setting
its ->done to a struct completion and waiting on it; however, for
cgroup writeback support, it's necessary to issue multiple work items
to multiple bdi_writebacks and wait for the completion of all.

This patch implements wb_completion which can wait for multiple work
items and replaces the struct completion with it.  It can be defined
using DEFINE_WB_COMPLETION_ONSTACK(), used for multiple work items and
waited for by wb_wait_for_completion().

Nobody currently issues multiple work items and this patch doesn't
introduce any behavior changes.
