writeback: make congestion functions per bdi_writeback

Currently, all congestion functions take bdi (backing_dev_info) and
always operate on the root wb (bdi->wb) and the congestion state from
the block layer is propagated only for the root blkcg.  This patch
introduces {set|clear}_wb_congested() and wb_congested() which take a
bdi_writeback_congested and bdi_writeback respectively.  The bdi
counteparts are now wrappers invoking the wb based functions on
@bdi->wb.

While converting clear_bdi_congested() to clear_wb_congested(), the
local variable declaration order between @wqh and @bit is swapped for
cosmetic reason.

This patch just adds the new wb based functions.  The following
patches will apply them.

v2: Updated for bdi_writeback_congested.
