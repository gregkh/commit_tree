i2c: refactor function to release a DMA safe buffer

a) rename to 'put' instead of 'release' to match 'get' when obtaining
   the buffer
b) change the argument order to have the buffer as first argument
c) add a new argument telling the function if the message was
   transferred. This allows the function to be used also in cases
   where setting up DMA failed, so the buffer needs to be freed without
   syncing to the message buffer.

Also convert the only user.
