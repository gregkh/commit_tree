mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: Add quirk for unstable clocks

Some controllers immediately report SDHCI_CLOCK_INT_STABLE after
enabling the clock even when the clock is not stable. When used in
conjunction with older/slower cards, this can result in:

    mmc0: error -84 whilst initialising SD card

When the stable reporting is known to be broken, we simply wait for the
maximum stabilization period.
