xfs: replace xfs_defer_ops ->dop_pending with on-stack list

The xfs_defer_ops ->dop_pending list is used to track active
deferred operations once intents are logged. These items must be
aborted in the event of an error. The list is populated as intents
are logged and items are removed as they complete (or are aborted).

Now that xfs_defer_finish() cancels on error, there is no need to
ever access ->dop_pending outside of xfs_defer_finish(). The list is
only ever populated after xfs_defer_finish() begins and is either
completed or cancelled before it returns.

Remove ->dop_pending from xfs_defer_ops and replace it with a local
list in the xfs_defer_finish() path. Pass the local list to the
various helpers now that it is not accessible via dfops. Note that
we have to check for NULL in the abort case as the final tx roll
occurs outside of the scope of the new local list (once the dfops
has completed and thus drained the list).
