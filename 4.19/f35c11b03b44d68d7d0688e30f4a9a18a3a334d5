arm64: dts: msm8996: thermal: Initialise via DT and add second controller

We also split up the regmap address space into two, for the TM and SROT
registers. This was required to deal with different address offsets for the
TM and SROT registers across different SoC families.

8996 has two TSENS IP blocks, initialise the second one too.

Since tsens-common.c/init_common() currently only registers one address
space, the order is important (TM before SROT). This is OK since the code
doesn't really use the SROT functionality yet.
