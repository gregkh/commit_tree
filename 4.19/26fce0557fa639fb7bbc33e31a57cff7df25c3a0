reset: imx7: Fix always writing bits as 0

Right now the only user of reset-imx7 is pci-imx6 and the
reset_control_assert and deassert calls on pciephy_reset don't toggle
the PCIEPHY_BTN and PCIEPHY_G_RST bits as expected. Fix this by writing
1 or 0 respectively.

The reference manual is not very clear regarding SRC_PCIEPHY_RCR but for
other registers like MIPIPHY and HSICPHY the bits are explicitly
documented as "1 means assert, 0 means deassert".

The values are still reversed for IMX7_RESET_PCIE_CTRL_APPS_EN.
