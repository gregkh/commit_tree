scsi: qla2xxx: remove irq save in qla2x00_poll()

In commit d2ba5675d899 ("[SCSI] qla2xxx: Disable local-interrupts while
polling for RISC status.") added a local_irq_disable() before invoking the
->intr_handler callback. The function, which was used in this callback, did
not disable interrupts while acquiring the spin_lock so a deadlock was
possible and this change was one possible solution.

The function in question was qla2300_intr_handler() and is using
spin_lock_irqsave() since commit 43fac4d97a1a ("[SCSI] qla2xxx: Resolve a
performance issue in interrupt").  I checked all other ->intr_handler
callbacks and all of them use the irqsave variant so it is safe to remove
the local_irq_save() block now.
