net: amd: pcnet32: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in pcnet32_alloc_ring()

pcnet32_alloc_ring() is never called in atomic context.
It calls kcalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC, which is not necessary.
GFP_ATOMIC can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
