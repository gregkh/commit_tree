net: macb: Clean 64b dma addresses if they are not detected

Clear ADDR64 dma bit in DMACFG register in case that HW_DMA_CAP_64B is
not detected on 64bit system.
The issue was observed when bootloader(u-boot) does not check macb
feature at DCFG6 register (DAW64_OFFSET) and enabling 64bit dma support
by default. Then macb driver is reading DMACFG register back and only
adding 64bit dma configuration but not cleaning it out.
