arm64: drop unused kernel_neon_begin_partial() macro

When kernel mode NEON was first introduced to the arm64 kernel,
every call to kernel_neon_begin()/_end() stacked resp. unstacked
the entire NEON register file, making it worthwile to reduce the
number of used NEON registers to a bare minimum, and only stack
those. kernel_neon_begin_partial() was introduced for this purpose,
but after the refactoring for SVE and other changes, it no longer
exists and was simply #define'd to kernel_neon_begin() directly.

In the mean time, all users have been updated, so let's remove
the fallback macro.
