net: pch_gbe: Remove reset_phy HAL abstraction

For some reason the pch_gbe driver contains a struct pch_gbe_functions
with pointers used by a HAL abstraction layer, even though there is only
one implementation of each function.

This patch removes the reset_phy abstraction in favor of calling
pch_gbe_phy_hw_reset directly.
