ravb: do not write 1 to reserved bits

EtherAVB hardware requires 0 to be written to status register bits in
order to clear them, however, care must be taken not to:

1. Clear other bits, by writing zero to them
2. Write one to reserved bits

This patch corrects the ravb driver with respect to the second point above.
This is done by defining reserved bit masks for the affected registers and,
after auditing the code, ensure all sites that may write a one to a
reserved bit use are suitably masked.
