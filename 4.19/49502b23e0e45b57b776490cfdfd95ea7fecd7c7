dt-bindings: clock: add rk3399 DDR3 standard speed bins.

DDR3 SDRAM Standard (JESD79-3F) defines some standard speed bins for
DDR3 memories. The rk3399_dmc driver allows you to pass these values via
the device tree. For that purpose the devfreq/rk3399_dmc.txt binding
refers to a ddr.h file which does not exist. This patch adds the missing
defines in a include file called rk3399-ddr.h with the definition of
standard speed bins according to the ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF).
