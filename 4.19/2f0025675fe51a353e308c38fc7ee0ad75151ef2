MIPS: VDSO: Force link endianness

When building the VDSO with clang it appears to invoke ld without
specifying endianness, even though clang itself was provided with a -EB
or -EL flag. This results in the build failing due to a mismatch between
the objects that are the input to ld, and the output it is attempting to
create:

  VDSO    arch/mips/vdso/vdso.so.dbg.raw
  mips-linux-ld: arch/mips/vdso/elf.o: compiled for a big endian system
    and target is little endian
  mips-linux-ld: arch/mips/vdso/elf.o: endianness incompatible with that
    of the selected emulation
  mips-linux-ld: failed to merge target specific data of file
    arch/mips/vdso/elf.o
  ...

Work around this problem by explicitly specifying the link endianness
using -Wl,-EB or -Wl,-EL when -EB or -EL are part of KBUILD_CFLAGS. This
resolves the build failure when using clang, and doesn't have any
negative effect on gcc.
