s390/mm: fix addressing exception after suspend/resume

Commit c9b5ad546e7d "s390/mm: tag normal pages vs pages used in page tables"
accidentally changed the logic in arch_set_page_states(), which is used by
the suspend/resume code. set_page_stable(page, order) was changed to
set_page_stable_dat(page, 0). After this, only the first page of higher order
pages will be set to stable, and a write to one of the unstable pages will
result in an addressing exception.

Fix this by using "order" again, instead of "0".
