fsi/master-gpio: Replace bit_bit lock with IRQ disable/enable

We currently use a spinlock (bit_lock) around operations that clock bits
out of the FSI bus, and a mutex to protect against simultaneous access
to the master.

This means that bit_lock isn't needed for mutual exlusion, only to
prevent timing issues when clocking bits out.

To reflect this, this change converts bit_lock to just the
local_irq_save/restore operation.
