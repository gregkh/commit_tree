xdp: Helpers for disabling napi_direct of xdp_return_frame

We need some mechanism to disable napi_direct on calling
xdp_return_frame_rx_napi() from some context.
When veth gets support of XDP_REDIRECT, it will redirects packets which
are redirected from other devices. On redirection veth will reuse
xdp_mem_info of the redirection source device to make return_frame work.
But in this case .ndo_xdp_xmit() called from veth redirection uses
xdp_mem_info which is not guarded by NAPI, because the .ndo_xdp_xmit()
is not called directly from the rxq which owns the xdp_mem_info.

This approach introduces a flag in bpf_redirect_info to indicate that
napi_direct should be disabled even when _rx_napi variant is used as
well as helper functions to use it.

A NAPI handler who wants to use this flag needs to call
xdp_set_return_frame_no_direct() before processing packets, and call
xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct() after xdp_do_flush_map() before
exiting NAPI.

v4:
- Use bpf_redirect_info for storing the flag instead of xdp_mem_info to
  avoid per-frame copy cost.
