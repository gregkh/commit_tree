iommu/rockchip: Handle errors returned from PM framework

pm_runtime_get_if_in_use can fail: either PM has been disabled
altogether (-EINVAL), or the device hasn't been enabled yet (0).
Sadly, the Rockchip IOMMU driver tends to conflate the two things
by considering a non-zero return value as successful.

This has the consequence of hiding other bugs, so let's handle this
case throughout the driver, with a WARN_ON_ONCE so that we can try
and work out what happened.
