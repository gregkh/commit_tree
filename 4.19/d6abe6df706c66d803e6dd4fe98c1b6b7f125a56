drm/bridge: sil_sii8620: do not have a dependency of RC_CORE

This patch makes RC_CORE to be selected with this driver.

sil_sii8620 driver calls remote controller interfaces directly
so RC_CORE should be enabled mandatorily.

And some boards not using remote controller device don't really
need to know that RC_CORE config should be enabled to use sil_sii8620
driver only for HDMI.

Changelog v2:
- select INPUT because compiling will fail without INPUT.
