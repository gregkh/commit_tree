i2c: designware: Move register access detection to common code

Move register access detection out from master and slave HW
initialization code to common code. Motivation for this is to have
register access configured before HW initialization and remove
duplicated code.

This allows to do further separation between probe time initialization
and runtime reinitialization code.
