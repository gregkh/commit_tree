iio: Add channel for Position Relative

Add new channel type for relative position on a pad.

These type of analog sensor offers the position of a pen
on a touchpad, and is represented as a voltage, which can be
converted to a position on X and Y axis on the pad.
The channel will hand the relative position on the pad in both directions.

The channel can then be consumed by a touchscreen driver or
read as-is for a raw indication of the touchpen on a touchpad.
