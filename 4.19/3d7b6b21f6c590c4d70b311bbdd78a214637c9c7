iomap: mark newly allocated buffer heads as new

In iomap_to_bh, not only mark buffer heads in IOMAP_UNWRITTEN maps as
new, but also buffer heads in IOMAP_MAPPED maps with the IOMAP_F_NEW
flag set.  This will be used by filesystems like gfs2, which allocate
blocks in iomap->begin.

Minor corrections to the comment for IOMAP_UNWRITTEN maps.
