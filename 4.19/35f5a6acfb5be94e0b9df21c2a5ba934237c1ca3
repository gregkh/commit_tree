ARM: 8782/1: vfp: clean up arch/arm/vfp/Makefile

Since commit 799c43415442 ("kbuild: thin archives make default for
all archs"), $(AR) is used instead of $(LD) to combine object files.

The following code in arch/arm/vfp/Makefile:

  LDFLAGS         +=--no-warn-mismatch

... is no longer used.

Also, arch/arm/Makefile already guards arch/arm/vfp/ by a boolean
symbol, CONFIG_VFP, like this:

  core-$(CONFIG_VFP)              += arch/arm/vfp/

So, $(CONFIG_VFP) is always evaluated to y in arch/arm/vfp/Makefile.
There is no point to use pseudo object, vfp.o, which never becomes
a module.  Add all objects to obj-y directly.
