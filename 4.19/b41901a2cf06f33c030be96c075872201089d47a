ACPI / battery: Do not export energy_full[_design] on devices without full_charge_capacity

On some devices (with a buggy _BIX implementation) full_charge_capacity
always reports as 0. This means that our energy_full sysfs attribute will
also always be 0, which is not useful to export.

Worse we calculate our reported capacity on full_charge_capacity and if it
is 0 we always report 0. This causes userspace to immediately shutdown or
hibernate the laptop since it assumes that the battery is critically low.

This commit makes us not report energy_full[_design] or capacity on such
broken devices, avoiding the immediate shutdown / hibernate from userspace.
