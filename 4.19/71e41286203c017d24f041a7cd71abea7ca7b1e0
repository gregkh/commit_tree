packet: switch kvzalloc to allocate memory

The patches includes following change:

*Use modern kvzalloc()/kvfree() instead of custom allocations.

*Remove order argument for alloc_pg_vec, it can get from req.

*Remove order argument for free_pg_vec, free_pg_vec now uses
kvfree which does not need order argument.

*Remove pg_vec_order from struct packet_ring_buffer, no longer
need to save/restore 'order'

*Remove variable 'order' for packet_set_ring, it is now unused
