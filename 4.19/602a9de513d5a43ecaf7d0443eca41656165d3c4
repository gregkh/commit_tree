drm/i915/skl: Add warn about unsupported CDCLK rates

While checking workarounds related to the CDCLK PLL, I noticed that the
DMC firmware bits for WA#1183 are missing for SKL. After that I
clarified with HW people that it's not needed on SKL, since it doesn't
support eDP1.4 which would be the only thing requiring the problematic
CDCLK clock rates. So in theory we shouldn't ever choose these
frequencies, but add an assert in any case for catching such cases and
for documentation.

v2:
- Move the check to skl_set_cdclk and warn whenever using the
  corresponding VCO freq. (Ville)

v3:
- Actually check for the platform. (Ville)
