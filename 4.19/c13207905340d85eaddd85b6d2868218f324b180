arm64: perf: Add support for chaining event counters

Add support for 64bit event by using chained event counters
and 64bit cycle counters.

PMUv3 allows chaining a pair of adjacent 32-bit counters, effectively
forming a 64-bit counter. The low/even counter is programmed to count
the event of interest, and the high/odd counter is programmed to count
the CHAIN event, taken when the low/even counter overflows.

For CPU cycles, when 64bit mode is requested, the cycle counter
is used in 64bit mode. If the cycle counter is not available,
falls back to chaining.
