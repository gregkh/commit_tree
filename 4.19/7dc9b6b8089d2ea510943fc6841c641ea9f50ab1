Drivers: hv: vmbus: Make TLFS #define names architecture neutral

The Hyper-V feature and hint flags in hyperv-tlfs.h are all defined
with the string "X64" in the name.  Some of these flags are indeed
x86/x64 specific, but others are not.  For the ones that are used
in architecture independent Hyper-V driver code, or will be used in
the upcoming support for Hyper-V for ARM64, this patch removes the
"X64" from the name.

This patch changes the flags that are currently known to be
used on multiple architectures. Hyper-V for ARM64 is still a
work-in-progress and the Top Level Functional Spec (TLFS) has not
been separated into x86/x64 and ARM64 areas.  So additional flags
may need to be updated later.

This patch only changes symbol names.  There are no functional
changes.
