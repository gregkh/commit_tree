PCI: Allow specifying devices using a base bus and path of devfns

When specifying PCI devices on the kernel command line using a
bus/device/function address, bus numbers can change when adding or
replacing a device, changing motherboard firmware, or applying kernel
parameters like "pci=assign-buses".  When bus numbers change, it's likely
the command line tweak will be applied to the wrong device.

Therefore, it is useful to be able to specify devices with a base bus
number and the path of devfns needed to get to it, similar to the "device
scope" structure in the Intel VT-d spec, Section 8.3.1.

Thus, we add an option to specify devices in the following format:

  [<domain>:]<bus>:<device>.<func>[/<device>.<func>]*

The path can be any segment within the PCI hierarchy of any length and
determined through the use of 'lspci -t'.  When specified this way, it is
less likely that a renumbered bus will result in a valid device
specification and the tweak won't be applied to the wrong device.
