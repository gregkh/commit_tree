tools arch uapi: Sync the x86 kvm.h copy

To get the changes in:

  d1766202779e ("x86/kvm/lapic: always disable MMIO interface in x2APIC mode")

That at this time will not generate changes in tools such as 'perf trace',
that still needs more work in tools/perf/examples/bpf/augmented_syscalls.c
to need such id -> string tables.

This silences the following perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
