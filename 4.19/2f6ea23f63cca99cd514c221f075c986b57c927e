arm64: KVM: Avoid marking pages as XN in Stage-2 if CTR_EL0.DIC is set

On systems where CTR_EL0.DIC is set, we don't need to perform
icache invalidation to guarantee that we'll fetch the right
instruction stream.

This also means that taking a permission fault to invalidate the
icache is an unnecessary overhead.

On such systems, we can safely leave the page as being executable.
