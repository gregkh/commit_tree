drm/amd/display: update clk for various HDMI color depths

[why]
When programming tonga's connector's backend we didn't take
in account that HDMI's colour depth might be more than 8bpc
therefore we need to add a switch statement that would adjust
the pixel clock accordingly.

[how]
Add a switch statement updating clock by its appropriate
coefficient.
