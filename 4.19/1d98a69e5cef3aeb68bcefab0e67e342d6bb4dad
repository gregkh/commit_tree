livepatch: Remove reliable stacktrace check in klp_try_switch_task()

Support for immediate flag was removed by commit d0807da78e11
("livepatch: Remove immediate feature").  We bail out during
patch registration for architectures, those don't support
reliable stack trace. Remove the check in klp_try_switch_task(),
as its not required.
