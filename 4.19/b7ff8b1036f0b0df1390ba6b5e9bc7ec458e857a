rds: Extend RDS API for IPv6 support

There are many data structures (RDS socket options) used by RDS apps
which use a 32 bit integer to store IP address. To support IPv6,
struct in6_addr needs to be used. To ensure backward compatibility, a
new data structure is introduced for each of those data structures
which use a 32 bit integer to represent an IP address. And new socket
options are introduced to use those new structures. This means that
existing apps should work without a problem with the new RDS module.
For apps which want to use IPv6, those new data structures and socket
options can be used. IPv4 mapped address is used to represent IPv4
address in the new data structures.
