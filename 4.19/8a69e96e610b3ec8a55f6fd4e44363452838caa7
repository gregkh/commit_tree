smb3: snapshot mounts are read-only and make sure info is displayable about the mount

snapshot mounts were not marked as read-only and did not display the snapshot
time (in /proc/mounts) specified on mount

With this patch - note that can not write to the snapshot mount (see "ro" in
/proc/mounts line) and also the missing snapshot timewarp token time is
dumped.  Sample line from /proc/mounts with the patch:

//127.0.0.1/scratch /mnt2 smb3 ro,relatime,vers=default,cache=strict,username=testuser,domain=,uid=0,noforceuid,gid=0,noforcegid,addr=127.0.0.1,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,soft,nounix,serverino,mapposix,noperm,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,echo_interval=60,snapshot=1234567,actimeo=1 0 0
