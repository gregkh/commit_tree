clk: tegra: Add sdmmc mux divider clock

Add a clock type to model the sdmmc switch divider clocks which have paths
to source clocks bypassing the divider (Low Jitter paths). These
are handled by selecting the lj path when the divider is 1 (ie the
rate is the parent rate), otherwise the normal path with divider
will be selected. Otherwise this clock behaves as a normal peripheral
clock.
