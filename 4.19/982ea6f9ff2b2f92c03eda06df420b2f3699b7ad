scsi: mpt3sas: Fix a race condition in mpt3sas_base_hard_reset_handler()

Since ioc->shost_recovery is set after ioc->reset_in_progress_mutex is
obtained, if concurrent resets are issued there is a short time during
which ioc->reset_in_progress_mutex is locked and ioc->shost_recovery ==
0. Avoid that this can cause trouble by unconditionally locking
ioc->shost_recovery.
