vmw_balloon: fix inflation of 64-bit GFNs

When balloon batching is not supported by the hypervisor, the guest
frame number (GFN) must fit in 32-bit. However, due to a bug, this check
was mistakenly ignored. In practice, when total RAM is greater than
16TB, the balloon does not work currently, making this bug unlikely to
happen.
