clockevents: Warn if cpu_all_mask is used as cpumask

Using cpu_all_mask in clockevents cpumask may result in issues while
comparing multiple clockevent devices to choose the preferred one.

On one of the platforms with 2 system (i.e. non per-CPU) timers with
different ratings, having cpu_all_mask for one of the device resulted in a
boot hang due to a endless loop in clockevents_notify_released() as both
were clocksources were selected as preferred.

In order to prevent such issues in the future, warn if any clockevent
driver sets cpu_all_mask as it's cpumask and just override it to use
cpu_possible_mask. All the existing occurrences of cpu_all_mask are already
replaced with cpu_possible_mask.
