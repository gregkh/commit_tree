ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Add mono speaker quirk

During my initial round of bytcr_rt5651 long-name patches I did not include
a difference for mono vs stereo speaker setups in the longname because it
seems that all 5651 devices with only a single speaker do some mixing of
left + right on the PCB.

However further testing has shown that while this works great when only
playing audio on the left or right channel, the output becomes garbled
when using both channels at once. Something which does not happen when
using the Stereo DAC MIXL / MIXR switches to mix the channels together
inside the codec and then only outputting on a single channel.

So we need to have separate UCM profiles and thus separate long-names
for devices with a mono speaker vs stereo speakers. Just as we already
have for the bytcr_rt5640 case.

This commit adds a new BYT_RT5651_MONO_SPEAKER quirk and adds "stereo-spk"
or "mono-spk" to the long-name based on this and enables this mapping on
devices with a mono speaker.

Changing the long-name like this is ok for now, since I'm still working
on the UCM profiles, so they are not in upstream alsa-lib yet.

This brings the long-name naming scheme fully in sync with the bytcr_rt5640
case, which is good from a consistency pov.
