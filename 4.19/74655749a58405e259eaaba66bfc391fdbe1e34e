ARM: OMAP2+: sleep33/43xx: Make sleep actions configurable

Add an argument to the sleep33xx and sleep43xx code to allow us to set
flags to determine which portions of the code get called in order to use
the same code for multiple power saving modes. This patch allows us to
decide whether or not we flush and disable caches, save EMIF context,
put the memory into self refresh and disable the EMIF, and/or invoke
the wkup_m3 when entering into WFI.
