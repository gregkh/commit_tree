KVM: arm/arm64: Skip updating PTE entry if no change

When there is contention on faulting in a particular page table entry
at stage 2, the break-before-make requirement of the architecture can
lead to additional refaulting due to TLB invalidation.

Avoid this by skipping a page table update if the new value of the PTE
matches the previous value.
