KVM: VMX: hide flexpriority from guest when disabled at the module level

As of commit 8d860bbeedef ("kvm: vmx: Basic APIC virtualization controls
have three settings"), KVM will disable VIRTUALIZE_APIC_ACCESSES when
a nested guest writes APIC_BASE MSR and kvm-intel.flexpriority=0,
whereas previously KVM would allow a nested guest to enable
VIRTUALIZE_APIC_ACCESSES so long as it's supported in hardware.  That is,
KVM now advertises VIRTUALIZE_APIC_ACCESSES to a guest but doesn't
(always) allow setting it when kvm-intel.flexpriority=0, and may even
initially allow the control and then clear it when the nested guest
writes APIC_BASE MSR, which is decidedly odd even if it doesn't cause
functional issues.

Hide the control completely when the module parameter is cleared.
