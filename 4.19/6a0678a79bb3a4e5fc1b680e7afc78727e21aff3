ext4: super: extend timestamps to 40 bits

The inode timestamps use 34 bits in ext4, but the various timestamps in
the superblock are limited to 32 bits. If every user accesses these as
'unsigned', then this is good until year 2106, but it seems better to
extend this a bit further in the process of removing the deprecated
get_seconds() function.

This adds another byte for each timestamp in the superblock, making
them long enough to store timestamps beyond what is in the inodes,
which seems good enough here (in ocfs2, they are already 64-bit wide,
which is appropriate for a new layout).

I did not modify e2fsprogs, which obviously needs the same change to
actually interpret future timestamps correctly.
