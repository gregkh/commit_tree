net: pch_gbe: Remove init_hw HAL abstraction

For some reason the pch_gbe driver contains a struct pch_gbe_functions
with pointers used by a HAL abstraction layer, even though there is only
one implementation of each function.

This patch removes the init_hw abstraction in favor of inlining its
single implementation (pch_gbe_plat_init_hw) into its single caller
(pch_gbe_reset).
