RDMA/ucma: check fd type in ucma_migrate_id()

The current code grabs the private_data of whatever file descriptor
userspace has supplied and implicitly casts it to a `struct ucma_file *`,
potentially causing a type confusion.

This is probably fine in practice because the pointer is only used for
comparisons, it is never actually dereferenced; and even in the
comparisons, it is unlikely that a file from another filesystem would have
a ->private_data pointer that happens to also be valid in this context.
But ->private_data is not always guaranteed to be a valid pointer to an
object owned by the file's filesystem; for example, some filesystems just
cram numbers in there.

Check the type of the supplied file descriptor to be safe, analogous to how
other places in the kernel do it.
