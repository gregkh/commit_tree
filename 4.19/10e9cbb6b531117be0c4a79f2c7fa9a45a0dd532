scsi: target: Convert target drivers to use sbitmap

The sbitmap and the percpu_ida perform essentially the same task,
allocating tags for commands.  The sbitmap outperforms the percpu_ida as
documented here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/22/553

The sbitmap interface is a little harder to use, but being able to remove
the percpu_ida code and getting better performance justifies the additional
complexity.
