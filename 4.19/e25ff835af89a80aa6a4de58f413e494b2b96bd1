xfs: Close race between direct IO and xfs_break_layouts()

This patch is the duplicate of ross's fix for ext4 for xfs.

If the refcount of a page is lowered between the time that it is returned
by dax_busy_page() and when the refcount is again checked in
xfs_break_layouts() => ___wait_var_event(), the waiting function
xfs_wait_dax_page() will never be called.  This means that
xfs_break_layouts() will still have 'retry' set to false, so we'll stop
looping and never check the refcount of other pages in this inode.

Instead, always continue looping as long as dax_layout_busy_page() gives us
a page which it found with an elevated refcount.
