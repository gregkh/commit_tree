drm/i915/ringbuffer: Brute force context restore

An issue encountered with switching mm on gen7 is that the GPU likes to
hang (with the VS unit busy) when told to force restore the current
context. We can simply workaround this by substituting the
MI_FORCE_RESTORE flag with a round-trip through the kernel_context,
forcing the context to be saved and restored; thereby reloading the
PP_DIR registers and updating the modified page directory!
