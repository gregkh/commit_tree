Drivers: hv: vmbus: Remove use of slow_virt_to_phys()

slow_virt_to_phys() is only implemented for arch/x86.
Remove its use in arch independent Hyper-V drivers, and
replace with test for vmalloc() address followed by
appropriate v-to-p function. This follows the typical
pattern of other drivers and avoids the need to implement
slow_virt_to_phys() for Hyper-V on ARM64.
