perf trace: Setup the augmented syscalls bpf-output event fields

The payload that is put in place by the eBPF script attached to
syscalls:sys_enter_openat (and other syscalls with pointers, in the
future) can be consumed by the existing sys_enter beautifiers if
evsel->priv is setup with a struct syscall_tp with struct tp_fields for
the 'syscall_id' and 'args' fields expected by the beautifiers, this
patch does just that.
