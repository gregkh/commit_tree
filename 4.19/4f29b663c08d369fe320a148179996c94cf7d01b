ASoC: rt1305: Use ULL suffixes for 64-bit constants

With gcc 4.1.2:

    sound/soc/codecs/rt1305.c: In function ‘rt1305_calibrate’:
    sound/soc/codecs/rt1305.c:1069: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type
    sound/soc/codecs/rt1305.c:1086: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type

Add the missing "ULL" suffixes to fix this.
