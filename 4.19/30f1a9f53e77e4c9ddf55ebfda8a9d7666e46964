crypto: arm64/aes-ce-gcm - don't reload key schedule if avoidable

Squeeze out another 5% of performance by minimizing the number
of invocations of kernel_neon_begin()/kernel_neon_end() on the
common path, which also allows some reloads of the key schedule
to be optimized away.

The resulting code runs at 2.3 cycles per byte on a Cortex-A53.
