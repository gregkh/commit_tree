drm/amdgpu: Allow to create BO lists in CS ioctl v3

This change is to support MESA performace optimization.
Modify CS IOCTL to allow its input as command buffer and an array of
buffer handles to create a temporay bo list and then destroy it
when IOCTL completes.
This saves on calling for BO_LIST create and destry IOCTLs in MESA
and by this improves performance.

v2: Avoid inserting the temp list into idr struct.

v3:
Remove idr alloation from amdgpu_bo_list_create.
Remove useless argument from amdgpu_cs_parser_fini
Minor cosmetic stuff.

v4: Revert amdgpu_bo_list_destroy back to static
