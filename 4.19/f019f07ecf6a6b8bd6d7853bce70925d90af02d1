uio: potential double frees if __uio_register_device() fails

The uio_unregister_device() function assumes that if "info->uio_dev" is
non-NULL that means "info" is fully allocated.  Setting info->uio_de
has to be the last thing in the function.

In the current code, if request_threaded_irq() fails then we return with
info->uio_dev set to non-NULL but info is not fully allocated and it can
lead to double frees.
