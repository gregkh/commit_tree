MIPS: lib: Provide MIPS64r6 __multi3() for GCC < 7

Some versions of GCC suboptimally generate calls to the __multi3()
intrinsic for MIPS64r6 builds, resulting in link failures due to the
missing function:

    LD      vmlinux.o
    MODPOST vmlinux.o
  kernel/bpf/verifier.o: In function `kmalloc_array':
  include/linux/slab.h:631: undefined reference to `__multi3'
  fs/select.o: In function `kmalloc_array':
  include/linux/slab.h:631: undefined reference to `__multi3'
  ...

We already have a workaround for this in which we provide the
instrinsic, but we do so selectively for GCC 7 only. Unfortunately the
issue occurs with older GCC versions too - it has been observed with
both GCC 5.4.0 & GCC 6.4.0.

MIPSr6 support was introduced in GCC 5, so all major GCC versions prior
to GCC 8 are affected and we extend our workaround accordingly to all
MIPS64r6 builds using GCC versions older than GCC 8.
