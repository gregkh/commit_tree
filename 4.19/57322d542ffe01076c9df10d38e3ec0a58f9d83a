mmc: sdhci: Add support for O2 eMMC HS200 mode

When use eMMC as boot device, the eMMC signaling voltage is tied to 1.8v
fixed output voltage, bios can set o2 sd host controller PCI configuration
register 0x308 bit4 to 1 to let driver skip 3.3v signaling voltage and
direct use 1.8v singling voltage in eMMC initialize process.
