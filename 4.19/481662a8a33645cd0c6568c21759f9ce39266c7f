mlxsw: reg: Add Policy-Engine Region Configuration Register

The PERCR register configures the region parameters such as whether to
consult the bloom filter before performing a lookup using a specific
eRP.

For C-TCAM only usage we don't need to accurately set the master mask.
Instead, we can set all of its bits to make sure all the extracted keys
are actually used.
