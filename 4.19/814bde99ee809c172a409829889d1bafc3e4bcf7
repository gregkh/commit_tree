drm/connector: Make ->atomic_commit() optional

Not all writeback connector implementations might want to commit things
from the connector driver. Some, like the malidp driver, commit things
from their main commit_tail() function, and would rather not have to
implement a dummy hook for drm_connector_helper_funcs.atomic_commit().

Make this function optional and reflect this fact in the doc.
