fsi/fsi-master-gpio: Add "no-gpio-delays" option

This adds support for an optional device-tree property that
makes the driver skip all the delays around clocking the
GPIOs and set it in the device-tree of common POWER9 based
OpenPower platforms.

This useful on chips like the AST2500 where the GPIO block is
running at a fairly low clock frequency (25Mhz typically). In
this case, the delays are unnecessary and due to the low
precision of the timers, actually quite harmful in terms of
performance.
