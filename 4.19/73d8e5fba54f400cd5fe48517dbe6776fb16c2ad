drm/i915/selftests: Detect unknown swizzling correctly

i915_gem_detect_bit_6_swizzle() tries to hide unknown swizzling from
userspace (and ourselves) leaving us with the only clue inside
i915->quirks & QUIRK_PIN_SWIZZLED_PAGES. If we see this bit set, it
means that we really have no clue as to what the swizzle pattern is
being used in any one page and so cannot compute what the reference
value should be in our tiling selftests. We have to skip the test.
