Btrfs: remove unused key assignment when doing a full send

At send.c:full_send_tree() we were setting the 'key' variable in the loop
while never using it later. We were also using two btrfs_key variables
to store the initial key for search and the key found in every iteration
of the loop. So remove this useless key assignment and use the same
btrfs_key variable to store the initial search key and the key found in
each iteration. This was introduced in the initial send commit but was
never used (commit 31db9f7c23fb ("Btrfs: introduce BTRFS_IOC_SEND for
btrfs send/receive").
