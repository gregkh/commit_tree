drm/i915: Move GEM sanitize from resume_early to resume

This should be a no-op in terms of our control flow, we move the
sanitization (GPU reset) from the bottom of the early resume phase to
the top of the next. However, following hibernation debug, the power
code skips the early resume phase, but as we are about to completely
restore the GTT mappings, we first need to stop the GPU using them i.e.
perform a GPU reset (i915_gem_sanitize()).
