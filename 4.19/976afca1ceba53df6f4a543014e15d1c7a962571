netfilter: nf_conncount: Early exit in nf_conncount_lookup() and cleanup

This patch is originally from Florian Westphal.

This patch does the following three tasks.

It applies the same early exit technique for nf_conncount_lookup().

Since now we keep the number of connections in 'struct nf_conncount_list',
we no longer need to return the count in nf_conncount_lookup().

Moreover, we expose the garbage collection function nf_conncount_gc_list()
for nft_connlimit.
