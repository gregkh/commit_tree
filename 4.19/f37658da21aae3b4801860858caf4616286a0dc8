r8169: align ASPM entry latency setting with vendor driver

The r8168 vendor driver always uses value 0x27. In r8169 we have few
chips where 0x17 is used. So far this didn't matter because ASPM was
disabled anyway. Now that ASPM was re-enabled let's also use 0x27 only.

One of the chips affected by this change is RTL8168E-VL, on my system
with this chip value 0x27 works fine.

In addition rename rtl_csi_access_enable_2() to
rtl_set_def_aspm_entry_latency() to make clear that we set the default
ASPM entry latency.
