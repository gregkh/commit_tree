ARM: dts: berlin: Add missing OPP properties for CPUs

The OPP properties, like "operating-points", should either be present
for all the CPUs of a cluster or none. If these are present only for a
subset of CPUs of a cluster then things will start falling apart as soon
as the CPUs are brought online in a different order. For example, this
will happen because the operating system looks for such properties in
the CPU node it is trying to bring up, so that it can create an OPP
table.

Add such missing properties.

Fix other missing properties (clocks, clock latency) as well to
make it all work.
