USB: yurex: Check for truncation in yurex_read()

snprintf() always returns the full length of the string it could have
printed, even if it was truncated because the buffer was too small.
So in case the counter value is truncated, we will over-read from
in_buffer and over-write to the caller's buffer.

I don't think it's actually possible for this to happen, but in case
truncation occurs, WARN and return -EIO.
