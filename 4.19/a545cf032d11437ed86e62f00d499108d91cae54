ocxl: Change return type for fault handler

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler. For now, this is
just documenting that the function returns a VM_FAULT value rather
than an errno. Once all instances are converted, vm_fault_t will
become a distinct type.

Ref-> commit 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t")

There is an existing bug when vm_insert_pfn() can return ENOMEM which
was ignored and VM_FAULT_NOPAGE returned as default. The new inline
vmf_insert_pfn() has removed this inefficiency by returning correct
vm_fault_ type.
