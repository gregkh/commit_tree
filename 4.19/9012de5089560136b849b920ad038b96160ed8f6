tipc: add sequence number check for link STATE messages

Some switch infrastructures produce huge amounts of packet duplicates.
This becomes a problem if those messages are STATE/NACK protocol
messages, causing unnecessary retransmissions of already accepted
packets.

We now introduce a unique sequence number per STATE protocol message
so that duplicates can be identified and ignored. This will also be
useful when tracing such cases, and to avert replay attacks when TIPC
is encrypted.

For compatibility reasons we have to introduce a new capability flag
TIPC_LINK_PROTO_SEQNO to handle this new feature.
