gpiolib: Defer on non-DT find_chip_by_name() failure

Avoid replication of error code conversion in non-DT GPIO consumers'
code by returning -EPROBE_DEFER from gpiod_find() in case a chip
identified by its label in a registered lookup table is not ready.

See https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/5/30/176 for example case.
