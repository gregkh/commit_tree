perf tools: Add is_compressed callback to compressions array

Add is_compressed callback to the compressions array, that returns 0 if
the file is compressed or != 0 if not.

The new callback is used to recognize the situation when we have a
'compressed' object, like:

  /lib/modules/.../drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb.ko.xz

but we need to read its debug data from debuginfo files, which might not
be compressed, like:

  /root/.debug/.build-id/d6/...c4b301f/debug

So even for a 'compressed' object we read debug data from a plain
uncompressed object. To keep this transparent, we detect this in
decompress_kmodule() and return the file descriptor to the uncompressed
file.
