ASoC: meson: add tdm interface driver

Add Amlogic's axg TDM interface driver. This driver manages the format
and clocks provided on the pads.

On this SoC, each stream direction provides 4 serial lanes. This makes
a maximum of 8 channels in i2s modes and 128 channels in DSP modes.

While each lanes operate on the same slot number (same bit clock), they
may have different TDM masks. This requires to provide a function to let
the card set the 4 masks, in lieu of the usual set_tdm_slots() callback
of the dai driver.
