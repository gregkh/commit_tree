Input: appletouch - replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL

atp_open(), atp_recover() and atp_resume() are never called in atomic
context. They call usb_submit_urb() with GFP_ATOMIC, which is not
necessary. GFP_ATOMIC can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
