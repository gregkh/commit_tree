powerpc: NMI IPI make NMI IPIs fully sychronous

There is an asynchronous aspect to smp_send_nmi_ipi. The caller waits
for all CPUs to call in to the handler, but it does not wait for
completion of the handler. This is a needless complication, so remove
it and always wait synchronously.

The synchronous wait allows the caller to easily time out and clear
the wait for completion (zero nmi_ipi_busy_count) in the case of badly
behaved handlers. This would have prevented the recent smp_send_stop
NMI IPI bug from causing the system to hang.
