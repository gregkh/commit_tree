xfs: use ->t_firstblock in xattr ops

Similar to the dirops code, the xattr code uses an on-stack
firstblock variable for the various operations. This code rolls the
underlying transaction in various places, however, which means we
cannot simply replace the local firstblock vars with ->t_firstblock.
Doing so (without further changes) would invalidate the memory
pointed to by xfs_da_args.firstblock as soon as the first
transaction rolls.

To avoid this problem, remove xfs_da_args.firstblock and replace all
such accesses with ->t_firstblock at the same time. This ensures
that accesses to the current firstblock always occur through the
current transaction rather than a potentially invalid xfs_da_args
pointer.
