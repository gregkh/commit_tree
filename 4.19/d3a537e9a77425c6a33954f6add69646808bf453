arm64: dts: rockchip: drop out-of-tree properties from rk3399-ficus regulator

The pwm-regulator for vdd_log uses additional unreviewed properties in the
vendor kernel, which slipped in with the devicetree.
As written, they are unreviewed and unused in all mainline implementations
so drop them again.
