ipv6: fix cleanup ordering for ip6_mr failure

Commit 15e668070a64 ("ipv6: reorder icmpv6_init() and ip6_mr_init()")
moved the cleanup label for ipmr_fail, but should have changed the
contents of the cleanup labels as well. Now we can end up cleaning up
icmpv6 even though it hasn't been initialized (jump to icmp_fail or
ipmr_fail).

Simply undo things in the reverse order of their initialization.

Example of panic (triggered by faking a failure of icmpv6_init):
