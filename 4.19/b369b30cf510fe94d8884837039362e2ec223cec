nvmet: use Retain Async Event bit to clear AEN

In the current implementation, we clear the AEN bit when we get the
"get log page" command if given log page is associated with AEN.
This patch allows optionally retaining the AEN for the ctrl
under consideration when Retain Asynchronous Event (RAE) bit is set
as a part of "get log page" command.

This allows the host to read the Log page and optionally retaining the
AEN associated with this log page when using userspace tools like
nvme-cli.
