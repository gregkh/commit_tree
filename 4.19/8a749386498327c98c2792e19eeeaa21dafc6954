xfs: cow unwritten conversion uses uninitialized dfops

A couple COW fork unwritten extent conversion helpers pass an
uninitialized dfops pointer to xfs_bmapi_write(). This does not
cause problems because conversion does not use a transaction or the
dfops structure for the COW fork.  Drop the uninitialized usage of
dfops in these codepaths and pass NULL along to xfs_bmapi_write()
instead.
