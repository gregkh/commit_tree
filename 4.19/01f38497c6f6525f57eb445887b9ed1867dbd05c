lockdep: Use this_cpu_ptr instead of get_cpu_var stats

get_cpu_var disables preemption which has the potential to call into the
preemption disable trace points causing some complications. There's also
no need to disable preemption in uses of get_lock_stats anyway since
preempt is already disabled. So lets simplify the code.
