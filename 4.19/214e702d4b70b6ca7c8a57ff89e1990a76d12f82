scsi: hisi_sas: Adjust task reject period during host reset

After soft_reset() for host reset, we should not be allowed to send
commands to the HW before the PHYs have come up and the port ids have been
refreshed.

Prior to this point, any commands cannot be successfully completed.

This exclusion is achieved by grabbing the host reset semaphore.
