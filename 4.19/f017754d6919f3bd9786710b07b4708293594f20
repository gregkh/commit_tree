ceph: add retry logic for error -ERANGE in ceph_get_acl()

When the size of acl extended attribution is larger than pre-allocated
value buffer size, we will hit error '-ERANGE' and it's probabaly caused
by concurrent get/set acl from different clients. In this case, current
logic just sets acl to NULL so that we cannot get proper information but
the operation looks successful.

This patch adds retry logic for error -ERANGE and return -EIO if fail
from the retry. Additionally, print real errno when failing from
__ceph_getxattr().
