ALSA: usb-audio: Processing Unit controls parsing in UAC2

Current support for UAC2 Processing Units does the parsing
as one control per bit in the bitmap. However, the UAC2 spec
defines the controls as bit pairs where b01 means read-only
and b11 means read/write control.

This patch fixes that and uses the helper functions for checking
controls readability/writability when the control is defined as
bit pairs (UAC2 and UAC3).
