net: qca_spi: Fix race condition in spi transfers

With performance optimization the spi transfer and messages of basic
register operations like qcaspi_read_register moved into the private
driver structure. But they weren't protected against mutual access
(e.g. between driver kthread and ethtool). So dumping the QCA7000
registers via ethtool during network traffic could make spi_sync
hang forever, because the completion in spi_message is overwritten.

So revert the optimization completely.
