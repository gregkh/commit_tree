crypto: arm64/aes-ce-gcm - operate on two input blocks at a time

Update the core AES/GCM transform and the associated plumbing to operate
on 2 AES/GHASH blocks at a time. By itself, this is not expected to
result in a noticeable speedup, but it paves the way for reimplementing
the GHASH component using 2-way aggregation.
