udp: Unbreak modules that rely on external __skb_recv_udp() availability

Commit 2276f58ac589 ("udp: use a separate rx queue for packet reception")
turned static inline __skb_recv_udp() from being a trivial helper around
__skb_recv_datagram() into a UDP specific implementaion, making it
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() at the same time.

There are external modules that got broken by __skb_recv_udp() not being
visible to them. Let's unbreak them by making __skb_recv_udp EXPORT_SYMBOL().

Rationale (one of those) why this is actually "technically correct" thing
to do: __skb_recv_udp() used to be an inline wrapper around
__skb_recv_datagram(), which itself (still, and correctly so, I believe)
is EXPORT_SYMBOL().
