tty: hvc: hvc_poll() break hv read loop

Avoid looping with the spinlock held while there is read data
being returned from the hv driver. Instead note if the entire
size returned by tty_buffer_request_room was read, and request
another read poll.

This limits the critical section lengths, and provides more
even service to other consoles in case there is a pathological
condition.
