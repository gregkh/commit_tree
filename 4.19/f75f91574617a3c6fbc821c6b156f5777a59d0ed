drm/i915: Shrink search list for active timelines

When switching to the kernel context, we force the switch to occur after
all currently active requests (so that we know the GPU won't switch
immediately away and the kernel context remains current as we work). To
do so we have to inspect all the timelines and add a fence from the
active work to queue our switch afterwards. We can use the tracked set
of active rings to shrink our search for active timelines.

v2: Use a local to shrink the list_for_each_entry()
