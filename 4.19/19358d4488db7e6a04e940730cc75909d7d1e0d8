i2c: rcar: implement STOP and REP_START according to docs

When doing a REP_START after a read message, the driver used to trigger
a STOP first which would then be overwritten by REP_START. This was the
only stable method found when doing the last refactoring. However, this
was not in accordance with the documentation.

After research from our BSP team and myself, we now can implement a
version which works and is according to the documentation. The new
approach ensures the ICMCR register is only changed when really needed.

Tested on a R-Car Gen2 (H2) and Gen3 with DMA (M3N).
