net: phy: Add support to configure clock in Broadcom iProc mdio mux

Add support to configure the internal rate adjust register based on the
core clock supplied through device tree in the Broadcom iProc mdio mux.

The operating frequency of the mdio mux block is 11MHz. This is derrived
by dividing the clock to the mdio mux with the rate adjust register.

In some SoC's the default values of the rate adjust register do not yield
11MHz. These SoC's are required to specify the clock via the device tree
for proper operation.
