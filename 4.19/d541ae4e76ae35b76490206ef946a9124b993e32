vt: avoid a VLA in the unicode screen scroll function

The nr argument is typically small: most often nr == 1. However this
could be abused with a very large explicit scroll in a resized screen.
Make the code scroll lines by performing an array rotation operation to
avoid the need for a large temporary space.
