xfs: refactor dfops init to attach to transaction

Most callers of xfs_defer_init() immediately attach the dfops
structure to a transaction. Add a transaction parameter to eliminate
much of this boilerplate code. This also helps self-document the
fact that many codepaths now expect a dfops pointer implicitly via
xfs_trans->t_dfops.
