drm: Begin an API for in-kernel clients

This the beginning of an API for in-kernel clients.
First out is a way to get a framebuffer backed by a dumb buffer.

Only GEM drivers are supported.
The original idea of using an exported dma-buf was dropped because it
also creates an anonomous file descriptor which doesn't work when the
buffer is created from a kernel thread. The easy way out is to use
drm_driver.gem_prime_vmap to get the virtual address, which requires a
GEM object. This excludes the vmwgfx driver which is the only non-GEM
driver apart from the legacy ones. A solution for vmwgfx will have to be
worked out later if it wants to support the client API which it probably
will when we have a bootsplash client.
