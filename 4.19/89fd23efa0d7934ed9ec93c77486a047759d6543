mtd: Fallback to ->_read/write() when ->_read/write_oob() is missing

Some MTD sublayers/drivers are implementing ->_read/write() and
not ->_read/write_oob().

While for NAND devices both are usually valid, for NOR devices, using
the _oob variant has no real meaning. But, as the MTD layer is supposed
to hide as much as possible the flash complexity to the user, there is
no reason to error out while it is just a matter of rewritting things
internally.

Add a fallback on mtd->_read() (resp. mtd->_write()) when the user calls
mtd_read_oob() (resp. mtd_write_oob()) while mtd->_read_oob() (resp.
mtd->_write_oob) is not implemented. There is already a fallback on the
_oob variant if the former is used.
