staging: vboxvideo: Change address of scanout buffer on page-flip

Commit 2408898e3b6c ("staging: vboxvideo: Add page-flip support") only
calls vbox_crtc_do_set_base() on page-flips, but despite that function's
name it only pins the new fb, unpins the old fb and sets
vbox_crtc->fb_offset. It does not program the hardware to scan out at the
new vbox_crtc->fb_offset value.

This was causing only every other frame (assuming page-flipping between 2
buffers) to be shown since we kept scanning out of the old (now unpinned!)
buffer.

This commit fixes this by adding code to vbox_crtc_page_flip() to tell
the hardware to scanout from the new fb_offset.
