tracing: Fix synthetic event to allow semicolon at end

Fix synthetic event to allow independent semicolon at end.

The synthetic_events interface accepts a semicolon after the
last word if there is no space.

 # echo "myevent u64 var;" >> synthetic_events

But if there is a space, it returns an error.

 # echo "myevent u64 var ;" > synthetic_events
 sh: write error: Invalid argument

This behavior is difficult for users to understand. Let's
allow the last independent semicolon too.
