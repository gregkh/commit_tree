net/sched: user-space can't set unknown tcfa_action values

Currently, when initializing an action, the user-space can specify
and use arbitrary values for the tcfa_action field. If the value
is unknown by the kernel, is implicitly threaded as TC_ACT_UNSPEC.

This change explicitly checks for unknown values at action creation
time, and explicitly convert them to TC_ACT_UNSPEC. No functional
changes are introduced, but this will allow introducing tcfa_action
values not exposed to user-space in a later patch.

Note: we can't use the above to hide TC_ACT_REDIRECT from user-space,
as the latter is already part of uAPI.

v3 -> v4:
 - use an helper to check for action validity (JiriP)
 - emit an extack for invalid actions (JiriP)
v4 -> v5:
 - keep messages on a single line, drop net_warn (Marcelo)
