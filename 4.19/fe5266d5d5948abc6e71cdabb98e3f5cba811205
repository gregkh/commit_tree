mm/swapfile.c: replace some #ifdef with IS_ENABLED()

In mm/swapfile.c, THP (Transparent Huge Page) swap specific code is
enclosed by #ifdef CONFIG_THP_SWAP/#endif to avoid code dilating when
THP isn't enabled.  But #ifdef/#endif in .c file hurt the code
readability, so Dave suggested to use IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_THP_SWAP)
instead and let compiler to do the dirty job for us.  This has potential
to remove some duplicated code too.  From output of `size`,

		text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
THP=y:         26269	   2076	    340	  28685	   700d	mm/swapfile.o
ifdef/endif:   24115	   2028	    340	  26483	   6773	mm/swapfile.o
IS_ENABLED:    24179	   2028	    340	  26547	   67b3	mm/swapfile.o

IS_ENABLED() based solution works quite well, almost as good as that of
#ifdef/#endif.  And from the diffstat, the removed lines are more than
added lines.

One #ifdef for split_swap_cluster() is kept.  Because it is a public
function with a stub implementation for CONFIG_THP_SWAP=n in swap.h.
