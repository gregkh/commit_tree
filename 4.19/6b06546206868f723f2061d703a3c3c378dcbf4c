Revert "blk-throttle: fix race between blkcg_bio_issue_check() and cgroup_rmdir()"

This reverts commit 4c6994806f708559c2812b73501406e21ae5dcd0.

Destroying blkgs is tricky because of the nature of the relationship. A
blkg should go away when either a blkcg or a request_queue goes away.
However, blkg's pin the blkcg to ensure they remain valid. To break this
cycle, when a blkcg is offlined, blkgs put back their css ref. This
eventually lets css_free() get called which frees the blkcg.

The above commit (4c6994806f70) breaks this order of events by trying to
destroy blkgs in css_free(). As the blkgs still hold references to the
blkcg, css_free() is never called.

The race between blkcg_bio_issue_check() and cgroup_rmdir() will be
addressed in the following patch by delaying destruction of a blkg until
all writeback associated with the blkcg has been finished.
