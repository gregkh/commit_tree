crypto/nx: Initialize 842 high and normal RxFIFO control registers

NX increments readOffset by FIFO size in receive FIFO control register
when CRB is read. But the index in RxFIFO has to match with the
corresponding entry in FIFO maintained by VAS in kernel. Otherwise NX
may be processing incorrect CRBs and can cause CRB timeout.

VAS FIFO offset is 0 when the receive window is opened during
initialization. When the module is reloaded or in kexec boot, readOffset
in FIFO control register may not match with VAS entry. This patch adds
nx_coproc_init OPAL call to reset readOffset and queued entries in FIFO
control register for both high and normal FIFOs.
