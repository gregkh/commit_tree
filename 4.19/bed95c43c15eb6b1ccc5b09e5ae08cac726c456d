scripts: add Python 3 compatibility to spdxcheck.py

"dict.has_key(key)" on dictionaries has been replaced with "key in
dict".  Additionally, when run under Python 3 some files don't decode
with the default encoding (tested with UTF-8).  To handle that, don't
open the file in text mode and decode text line-by-line, ignoring
encoding errors.

This remains compatible with Python 2 and should have no functional
change.
