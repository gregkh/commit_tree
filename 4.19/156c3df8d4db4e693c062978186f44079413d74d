staging: erofs: disable compiling temporarile

As Stephen Rothwell reported:

"After merging the staging tree, today's linux-next build (x86_64
allmodconfig) failed like this:

Caused by various commits creating erofs in the staging tree interacting
with various commits redoing the mount infrastructure in the vfs tree.

I have disabed CONFIG_EROFS_FS for now:"

The reason of compiling error is:

Since -next collects and merges developing patches including common vfs
stuff from multi-trees, but those patches didn't cover erofs, such as:

('vfs: Suppress MS_* flag defs within the kernel unless explicitly enabled")
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=109b45090d7d3ce2797bb1ef7f70eead5bfe0ff3

("vfs: Require specification of size of mount data for internal mounts")
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=0a191e4505a4f255e6513b49426213da69bf0e80

Above vfs related patches has not been merged in staging tree, if we
submit those erofs patches to staging mailing list and after including
them in staging-{test,nexts} tree, it can easily cause compiling error.

We worked out some patches to adjust those vfs change, but now we just
submit them to -next tree temporarily to avoid compiling error.

For potentail conflict in between erofs and vfs changes in incoming
merge window, Stephen suggested that we can disable CONFIG_EROFS_FS
temporarily to pass merge window, and after that we can do restore by
reenabling CONFIG_EROFS_FS and applying those fixing patches. Also
Greg confirmed this solution.

So, let's disable compiling erofs for a while.
