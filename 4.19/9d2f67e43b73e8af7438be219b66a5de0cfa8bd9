net/packet: fix packet drop as of virtio gso

When we use raw socket as the vhost backend, a packet from virito with
gso offloading information, cannot be sent out in later validaton at
xmit path, as we did not set correct skb->protocol which is further used
for looking up the gso function.

To fix this, we set this field according to virito hdr information.
