staging: gasket: apex: move driver-private defines out of apex.h

apex.h is supposed to contain kernel-userspace interface definitions,
but has a number of defines that are only used by apex_driver.c or are
not used at all.  Move driver implementation defines not shared with
userspace to the driver source.  Remove unused defines.
