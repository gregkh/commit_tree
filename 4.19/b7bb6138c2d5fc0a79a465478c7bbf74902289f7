drm/i915: Only reset hangcheck at the start of an activity cycle

Across a reset, the seqno (and thus hangcheck) should restart and the
hangcheck naturally progress, for when it does not, we want to declare an
emergency. Currently, we only detect if reset and reinit fails, but we
do not detect if the call to reinit succeeds but the HW is fried - as we
are resetting hangcheck on initialisation the engine. Remove that and
rely on the natural progress to reset the hangcheck timer.
