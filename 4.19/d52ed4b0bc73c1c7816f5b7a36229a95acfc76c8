ASoC: wm_adsp: Parse HOST_BUFFER controls

Currently the compressed streams in DSP firmwares are
identified essentially by looking at a fixed location inside
the firmware. This is fragile and also limits things to a
single compressed stream.

Here a new form of firmware parameter is added, the HOST_BUFFER
which identifies a compressed stream from meta-data in the
firmware file. This is more robust and allows for the possiblity
of using multiple streams per core in the future. Currently the
implementation is still limited to a single stream and will
use the first HOST_BUFFER parameter encountered. If there aren't
any HOST_BUFFER parameters it will fall back to the legacy way
of finding the host buffer.
