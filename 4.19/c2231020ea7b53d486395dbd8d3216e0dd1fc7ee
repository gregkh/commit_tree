mm: thp: register mm for khugepaged when merging vma for shmem

When merging anonymous page vma, if the size of the vma can fit in at
least one hugepage, the mm will be registered for khugepaged for
collapsing THP in the future.

But it skips shmem vmas.  Do so for shmem also, but not for file-private
mappings when merging a vma in order to increase the odds of collapsing
a hugepage via khugepaged.

hugepage_vma_check() sounds like a good fit to do the check.  And move
the definition of it before khugepaged_enter_vma_merge() to avoid a
build error.
