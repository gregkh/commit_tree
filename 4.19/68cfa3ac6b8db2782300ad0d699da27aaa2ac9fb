selftests/bpf: add a cgroup storage test

Implement a test to cover the cgroup storage functionality.
The test implements a bpf program which drops every second packet
by using the cgroup storage as a persistent storage.

The test also use the userspace API to check the data
in the cgroup storage, alter it, and check that the loaded
and attached bpf program sees the update.

Expected output:
  $ ./test_cgroup_storage
  test_cgroup_storage:PASS
