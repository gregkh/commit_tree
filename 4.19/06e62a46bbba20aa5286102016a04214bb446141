fork: don't copy inconsistent signal handler state to child

Before this change, if a multithreaded process forks while one of its
threads is changing a signal handler using sigaction(), the memcpy() in
copy_sighand() can race with the struct assignment in do_sigaction().  It
isn't clear whether this can cause corruption of the userspace signal
handler pointer, but it definitely can cause inconsistency between
different fields of struct sigaction.

Take the appropriate spinlock to avoid this.

I have tested that this patch prevents inconsistency between sa_sigaction
and sa_flags, which is possible before this patch.
