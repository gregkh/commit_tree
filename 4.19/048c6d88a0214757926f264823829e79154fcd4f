usb: usbtmc: Add ioctls to set/get usb timeout

Add ioctls USBTMC_IOCTL_GET_TIMEOUT / USBTMC_IOCTL_SET_TIMEOUT to
get/set I/O timeout for specific file handle.

Different operations on an instrument can take different lengths of
time thus it is important to be able to set the timeout slightly
longer than the expected duration of each operation to optimise the
responsiveness of the application. As the instrument may be shared by
multiple applications the timeout should be settable on a per file
descriptor basis.
