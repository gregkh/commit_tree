btrfs: fix mount and ioctl device scan ioctl race

Technically this extends the critical section covered by uuid_mutex to:

- parse early mount options -- here we can call device scan on paths
  that can be passed as 'device=/dev/...'

- scan the device passed to mount

- open the devices related to the fs_devices -- this increases
  fs_devices::opened

The race can happen when mount calls one of the scans and there's
another one called eg. by mkfs or 'btrfs dev scan':

Mount                                  Scan
-----                                  ----
scan_one_device (dev1, fsid1)
                                       scan_one_device (dev2, fsid1)
				           add the device
					   free stale devices
					       fsid1 fs_devices::opened == 0
					           find fsid1:dev1
					           free fsid1:dev1
					           if it's the last one,
					            free fs_devices of fsid1
						    too

open_devices (dev1, fsid1)
   dev1 not found

When fixed, the uuid mutex will make sure that mount will increase
fs_devices::opened and this will not be touched by the racing scan
ioctl.
