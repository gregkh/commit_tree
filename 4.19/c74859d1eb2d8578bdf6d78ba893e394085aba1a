rcu: Make rcu_report_unblock_qs_rnp() warn on violated preconditions

If rcu_report_unblock_qs_rnp() is invoked on something other than
preemptible RCU or if there are still preempted tasks blocking the
current grace period, something went badly wrong in the caller.
This commit therefore adds WARN_ON_ONCE() to these conditions, but
leaving the legitimate reason for early exit (rnp->qsmask != 0)
unwarned.
