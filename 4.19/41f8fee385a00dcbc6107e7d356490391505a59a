ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: Hog "keybrd_dataout" GPIO pin

"keybrd_dataout" GPIO pin used to be initialized by ams-delta-serio
driver to a state safe for ams-delta-serio device function and not
changed thereafter.  As such, it may be assumed not under the driver
control and responsibility for its initialization handed over to board
init file.

Introduce a GPIO hog table and take over control of the
"keybrd_dataout" GPIO pin from the ams-delta-serio driver.
