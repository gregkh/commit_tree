parport: parport_serial: Add WCH CH382L PCIe single parallel port support

The WCH CH382L PCIe adapter has 1 parallel port but unlike the similar
WCH CH328 adapter there are no serial ports connected to it.  Enable
this adapter with the addition of the appropriate PCIe IDs and board
support config.
