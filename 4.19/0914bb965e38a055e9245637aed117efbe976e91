pnfs/blocklayout: off by one in bl_map_stripe()

"dev->nr_children" is the number of children which were parsed
successfully in bl_parse_stripe().  It could be all of them and then, in
that case, it is equal to v->stripe.volumes_count.  Either way, the >
should be >= so that we don't go beyond the end of what we're supposed
to.
