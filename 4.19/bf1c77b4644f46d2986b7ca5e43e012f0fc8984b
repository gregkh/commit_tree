kernel: add ksys_personality()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel call to the
sys_personality() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function
is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it
uses the same calling convention as sys_personality().

Since ksys_personality is trivial, it is implemented directly in
<linux/syscalls.h>, as we do for ksys_close() and friends.

This helper is necessary to enable conversion of arm64's syscall
handling to use pt_regs wrappers.
