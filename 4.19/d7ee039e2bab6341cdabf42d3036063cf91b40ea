KVM: vmx: move struct host_state usage to struct loaded_vmcs

Make host_state a property of a loaded_vmcs so that it can be
used as a cache of the VMCS fields, e.g. to lazily VMWRITE the
corresponding VMCS field.  Treating host_state as a cache does
not work if it's not VMCS specific as the cache would become
incoherent when switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02.

Move vmcs_host_cr3 and vmcs_host_cr4 into host_state.

Explicitly zero out host_state when allocating a new VMCS for a
loaded_vmcs.  Unlike the pre-existing vmcs_host_cr{3,4} usage,
the segment information is not guaranteed to be (re)initialized
when running a new nested VMCS, e.g. HOST_FS_BASE is not written
in vmx_set_constant_host_state().
