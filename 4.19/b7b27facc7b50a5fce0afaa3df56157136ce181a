arm/arm64: KVM: Add KVM_GET/SET_VCPU_EVENTS

For the migrating VMs, user space may need to know the exception
state. For example, in the machine A, KVM make an SError pending,
when migrate to B, KVM also needs to pend an SError.

This new IOCTL exports user-invisible states related to SError.
Together with appropriate user space changes, user space can get/set
the SError exception state to do migrate/snapshot/suspend.
