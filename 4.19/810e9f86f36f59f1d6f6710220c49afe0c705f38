powerpc/nohash: fix pte_access_permitted()

Commit 5769beaf180a8 ("powerpc/mm: Add proper pte access check helper
for other platforms") replaced generic pte_access_permitted() by an
arch specific one.

The generic one is defined as
(pte_present(pte) && (!(write) || pte_write(pte)))

The arch specific one is open coded checking that _PAGE_USER and
_PAGE_WRITE (_PAGE_RW) flags are set, but lacking to check that
_PAGE_RO and _PAGE_PRIVILEGED are unset, leading to a useless test
on targets like the 8xx which defines _PAGE_RW and _PAGE_USER as 0.

Commit 5fa5b16be5b31 ("powerpc/mm/hugetlb: Use pte_access_permitted
for hugetlb access check") replaced some tests performed with
pte helpers by a call to pte_access_permitted(), leading to the same
issue.

This patch rewrites powerpc/nohash pte_access_permitted()
using pte helpers.
