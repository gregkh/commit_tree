net: Record receive queue number for a connection

This patch adds a new field to sock_common 'skc_rx_queue_mapping'
which holds the receive queue number for the connection. The Rx queue
is marked in tcp_finish_connect() to allow a client app to do
SO_INCOMING_NAPI_ID after a connect() call to get the right queue
association for a socket. Rx queue is also marked in tcp_conn_request()
to allow syn-ack to go on the right tx-queue associated with
the queue on which syn is received.
