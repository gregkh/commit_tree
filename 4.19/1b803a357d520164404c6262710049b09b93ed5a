h8300:let the checker know that size_t is ulong

All 64bit archs use unsigned long for size_t and most 32bit
archs use 'unsigned int'. By default, this is what is assumed
by sparse.

However, on h8300 (a 32bit arch) size_t is unsigned long which
can led sparse to emit wrong warnings.

Fix this by passing to sparse the flag -msize-long, telling it
that size_t is unsigned long.
