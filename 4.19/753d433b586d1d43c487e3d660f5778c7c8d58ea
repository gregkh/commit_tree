random: Return nbytes filled from hw RNG

Currently the function get_random_bytes_arch() has return value 'void'.
If the hw RNG fails we currently fall back to using get_random_bytes().
This defeats the purpose of requesting random material from the hw RNG
in the first place.

There are currently no intree users of get_random_bytes_arch().

Only get random bytes from the hw RNG, make function return the number
of bytes retrieved from the hw RNG.
