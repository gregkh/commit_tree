net: sched: act_tunnel_key: remove dependency on rtnl lock

Use tcf lock to protect tunnel key action struct private data from
concurrent modification in init and dump. Use rcu swap operation to
reassign params pointer under protection of tcf lock. (old params value is
not used by init, so there is no need of standalone rcu dereference step)

Remove rtnl lock assertion that is no longer required.
