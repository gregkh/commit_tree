igb: Use an advanced ctx descriptor for launchtime

On i210, Launchtime (TxTime) requires the usage of an "Advanced
Transmit Context Descriptor" for retrieving the timestamp of a packet.

The igb driver correctly builds such descriptor on the segmentation
flow (i.e. igb_tso()) or on the checksum one (i.e. igb_tx_csum()), but the
feature is broken for AF_PACKET if the IGB_TX_FLAGS_VLAN is not set,
which happens due to an early return on igb_tx_csum().

This flag is only set by the kernel when a VLAN interface is used,
thus we can't just rely on it. Here we are fixing this issue by checking
if launchtime is enabled for the current tx_ring before performing the
early return.
