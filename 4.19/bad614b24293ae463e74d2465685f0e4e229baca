iommu: Enable debugfs exposure of IOMMU driver internals

Provide base enablement for using debugfs to expose internal data of an
IOMMU driver. When called, create the /sys/kernel/debug/iommu directory.

Emit a strong warning at boot time to indicate that this feature is
enabled.

This function is called from iommu_init, and creates the initial DebugFS
directory. Drivers may then call iommu_debugfs_new_driver_dir() to
instantiate a device-specific directory to expose internal data.
It will return a pointer to the new dentry structure created in
/sys/kernel/debug/iommu, or NULL in the event of a failure.

Since the IOMMU driver can not be removed from the running system, there
is no need for an "off" function.
