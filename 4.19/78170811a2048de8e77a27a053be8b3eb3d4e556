regulator: pfuze100: add optional disable switch-regulators binding

This binding is used to keep the backward compatibility with the current
dtb's [1]. The binding informs the driver that the unused switch regulators
can be disabled.
If it is not specified, the driver doesn't disable the switch regulators.
