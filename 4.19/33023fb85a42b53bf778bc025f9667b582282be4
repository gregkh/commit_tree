IB/core: add max_send_sge and max_recv_sge attributes

This patch replaces the ib_device_attr.max_sge with max_send_sge and
max_recv_sge. It allows ulps to take advantage of devices that have very
different send and recv sge depths.  For example cxgb4 has a max_recv_sge
of 4, yet a max_send_sge of 16.  Splitting out these attributes allows
much more efficient use of the SQ for cxgb4 with ulps that use the RDMA_RW
API. Consider a large RDMA WRITE that has 16 scattergather entries.
With max_sge of 4, the ulp would send 4 WRITE WRs, but with max_sge of
16, it can be done with 1 WRITE WR.
