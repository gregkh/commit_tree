xfs: combine [a]sync buffer submission apis

The buffer I/O submission path consists of separate function calls
per type. The buffer I/O type is already controlled via buffer
state (XBF_ASYNC), however, so there is no real need for separate
submission functions.

Combine the buffer submission functions into a single function that
processes the buffer appropriately based on XBF_ASYNC. Retain an
internal helper with a conditional wait parameter to continue to
support batched !XBF_ASYNC submission/completion required by delwri
queues.
