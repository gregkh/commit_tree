net: pch_gbe: Remove pch_gbe_hal_setup_init_funcs

The pch_gbe driver calls a pch_gbe_hal_setup_init_funcs function which
ultimately sets the value of one field in struct pch_gbe_phy_info in a
convoluted way.

This patch removes pch_gbe_hal_setup_init_funcs in favor of inlining it,
and in turn its callee pch_gbe_plat_init_function_pointers, into the
single caller pch_gbe_sw_init.

With this pch_gbe_api.c & pch_gbe_api.h are essentially empty, so they
are removed & inclusions of the latter replaced with pch_gbe_phy.h which
was previously being included via pch_gbe_api.h.
