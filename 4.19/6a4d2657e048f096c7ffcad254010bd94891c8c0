x86/smp: Provide topology_is_primary_thread()

If the CPU is supporting SMT then the primary thread can be found by
checking the lower APIC ID bits for zero. smp_num_siblings is used to build
the mask for the APIC ID bits which need to be taken into account.

This uses the MPTABLE or ACPI/MADT supplied APIC ID, which can be different
than the initial APIC ID in CPUID. But according to AMD the lower bits have
to be consistent. Intel gave a tentative confirmation as well.

Preparatory patch to support disabling SMT at boot/runtime.
