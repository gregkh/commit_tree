microblaze: add endianness options to LDFLAGS instead of LD

With the recent syntax extension, Kconfig is now able to evaluate the
compiler / toolchain capability.

However, accumulating flags to 'LD' is not compatible with the way
it works; 'LD' must be passed to Kconfig to call $(ld-option,...)
from Kconfig files.  If you tweak 'LD' in arch Makefile depending on
CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN, this would end up with circular dependency
between Makefile and Kconfig.
