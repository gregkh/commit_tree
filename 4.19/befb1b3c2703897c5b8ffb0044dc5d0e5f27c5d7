perf/core: Add sanity check to deal with pinned event failure

It is possible that a failure can occur during the scheduling of a
pinned event. The initial portion of perf_event_read_local() contains
the various error checks an event should pass before it can be
considered valid. Ensure that the potential scheduling failure
of a pinned event is checked for and have a credible error.
