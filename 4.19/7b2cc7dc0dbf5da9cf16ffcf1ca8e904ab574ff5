scsi: target: Simplify the code for waiting for command completion

Instead of embedding the completion that is used for waiting for command
completion in struct se_cmd, let the context that waits for command
completion allocate it. This makes it possible to have a single code path
for non-aborted and aborted commands in target_release_cmd_kref() and
avoids that transport_generic_free_cmd() has to call
cmd->se_tfo->release_cmd() directly. This patch does not change any
functionality. Note: transport_generic_free_cmd() only waits until the
se_cmd reference count has reached zero after it has set both
CMD_T_FABRIC_STOP and CMD_T_ABORTED.
