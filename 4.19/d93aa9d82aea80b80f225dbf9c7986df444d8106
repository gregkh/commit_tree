new wrapper: alloc_file_pseudo()

takes inode, vfsmount, name, O_... flags and file_operations and
either returns a new struct file (in which case inode reference we
held is consumed) or returns ERR_PTR(), in which case no refcounts
are altered.

converted aio_private_file() and sock_alloc_file() to it
