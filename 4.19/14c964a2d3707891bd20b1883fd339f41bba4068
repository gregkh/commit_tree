staging:rtl8192u: Remove repeated definitions - Style

Remove bit field masks which are defined in two files: r819xU_phy.h
and r819xU_phyreg.h. Or in the case of bMaskByte3 defined but never used.

The definitions have been removed from the file r819xU_phy.h.

This is a coding style change, which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
