ARM: use __inttype() in get_user()

Borrow the x86 implementation of __inttype() to use in get_user() to
select an integer type suitable to temporarily hold the result value.
This is necessary to avoid propagating the volatile nature of the
result argument, which can cause the following warning:

lib/iov_iter.c:413:5: warning: optimization may eliminate reads and/or writes to register variables [-Wvolatile-register-var]
