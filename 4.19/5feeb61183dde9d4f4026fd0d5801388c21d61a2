evm: Allow non-SHA1 digital signatures

SHA1 is reasonable in HMAC constructs, but it's desirable to be able to
use stronger hashes in digital signatures. Modify the EVM crypto code so
the hash type is imported from the digital signature and passed down to
the hash calculation code, and return the digest size to higher layers
for validation.
