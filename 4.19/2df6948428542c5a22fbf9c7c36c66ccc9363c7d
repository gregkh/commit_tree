USB: cdc-wdm: don't enable interrupts in USB-giveback

In the code path
  __usb_hcd_giveback_urb()
  -> wdm_in_callback()
   -> service_outstanding_interrupt()

The function service_outstanding_interrupt() will unconditionally enable
interrupts during unlock and invoke usb_submit_urb() with GFP_KERNEL.
If the HCD completes in BH (like ehci does) then the context remains
atomic due local_bh_disable() and enabling interrupts does not change
this.

Defer the error case handling to a workqueue as suggested by Oliver
Neukum. In case of an error the worker performs the read out and wakes
the user.
