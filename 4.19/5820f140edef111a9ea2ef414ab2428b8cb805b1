userns: move user access out of the mutex

The old code would hold the userns_state_mutex indefinitely if
memdup_user_nul stalled due to e.g. a userfault region. Prevent that by
moving the memdup_user_nul in front of the mutex_lock().

Note: This changes the error precedence of invalid buf/count/*ppos vs
map already written / capabilities missing.
