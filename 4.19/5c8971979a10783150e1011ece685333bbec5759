net: hns3: Fix for l4 checksum offload bug

Hardware only support tcp/udp/sctp l4 checksum offload, but
the driver currently tell hardware to do l4 checksum offlad when
l3 is IPv4 or IPv6, which may cause checksumm error.

This patch fixes it by only enabling the l4 offload when l4 is
tcp/udp/sctp.
