ARM: 8783/1: NOMMU: Extend check for VBAR support

ARMv8R adds support for VBAR and updates ID_PFR1 with the new filed
Sec_frac (bits [23:20]):

Security fractional field. When the Security field is 0000, determines
the support for features from the ARMv7 Security Extensions. Permitted
values are:

0000 No features from the ARMv7 Security Extensions are implemented.
     This value is not supported in ARMv8 if ID_PFR1 bits [7:4] are zero.

0001 The implementation includes the VBAR, and the TCR.PD0 and TCR.PD1
     bits.

0010 As for 0001, plus the ability to access Secure or Non-secure
     physical memory is supported.

All other values are reserved.

This field is only valid when ID_PFR1[7:4] == 0, otherwise it holds
the value 0000.
