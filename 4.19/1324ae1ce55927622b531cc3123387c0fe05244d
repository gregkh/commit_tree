scsi: hisi_sas: Only process broadcast change in phy_bcast_v3_hw()

There are many BROADCAST primitives generated by the host. We are only
interested in BROADCAST (CHANGE) primitives currently, so only process
this.

We have applied this processing for v2 hw before, and it is also needed for
v3 hw.
