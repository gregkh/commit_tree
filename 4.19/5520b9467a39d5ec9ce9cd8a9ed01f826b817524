media: v4l2-ctrl: Change control for VP8 profile to menu control

Add a menu control V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_VP8_PROFILE for VP8 profile and make
V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_VPX_PROFILE an alias of it. This new control is used to
select the desired profile for VP8 encoder and query for supported profiles by
VP8 encoder/decoder.

Though we have originally a control V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_VPX_PROFILE and its name
contains 'VPX', it works only for VP8 because supported profiles usually differ
between VP8 and VP9. In addition, this control cannot be used for querying since
it is not a menu control but an integer control, which cannot return an
arbitrary set of supported profiles.

The new control V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_VP8_PROFILE is a menu control as with
controls for other codec profiles. (e.g. H264)

In addition, this patch also fixes the use of V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_VPX_PROFILE in
drivers of Qualcomm's venus and Samsung's s5p-mfc.
