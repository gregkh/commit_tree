i2c: tegra: Add support for Tegra194

In order to support advanced features, the I2C FIFO interface was
changed in the version of the Tegra I2C controller found in Tegra194.
The changes are backwards incompatible, so the driver needs to be
programmed in a slightly different way on new chips.

Add support for MST FIFO programming and add an OF match entry for
Tegra194. At the same time, mark all prior generations of this
controller as not having the MST FIFO interface.
