efi/arm: map UEFI memory map even w/o runtime services enabled

Under the current implementation, UEFI memory map will be mapped and made
available in virtual mappings only if runtime services are enabled.
But in a later patch, we want to use UEFI memory map in acpi_os_ioremap()
to create mappings of ACPI tables using memory attributes described in
UEFI memory map.
See the following commit:
    arm64: acpi: fix alignment fault in accessing ACPI tables

So, as a first step, arm_enter_runtime_services() is modified, alongside
Ard's patch[1], so that UEFI memory map will not be freed even if
efi=noruntime.
