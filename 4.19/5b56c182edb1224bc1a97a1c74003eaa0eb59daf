ARM: at91: pm: Add ULP1 mode support

In the ULP1 mode, in order to achieve the lowest power consumption
with the system in retention mode and be able to resume on the wake
up events, all the clocks are shut off, inclusive the embedded 12MHz
RC oscillator, and the number of wake up sources is limited as well.
When the wake up event is asserted, the embedded 12MHz RC oscillator
restarts automatically.

The ULP1 (Ultra Low-power mode 1) is introduced by SAMA5D2.

The previous size of pm_suspend.o was 2148 bytes. With the addition of
ULP1 mode the new size of pm_suspend.o raised at 2456 bytes.
