x86/intel_rdt: Making CBM name and type more explicit

cbm_validate() receives a pointer to the variable that will be initialized
with a validated capacity bitmask. The pointer points to a variable of type
unsigned long that is immediately assigned to a variable of type u32 by the
caller on return from cbm_validate().

Let cbm_validate() initialize a variable of type u32 directly.

At this time also change tha variable name "data" within parse_cbm() to a
name more reflective of the content: "cbm_val". This frees up the generic
"data" to be used later when it is indeed used for a collection of input.
