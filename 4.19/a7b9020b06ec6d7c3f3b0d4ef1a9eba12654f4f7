x86/l1tf: Handle EPT disabled state proper

If Extended Page Tables (EPT) are disabled or not supported, no L1D
flushing is required. The setup function can just avoid setting up the L1D
flush for the EPT=n case.

Invoke it after the hardware setup has be done and enable_ept has the
correct state and expose the EPT disabled state in the mitigation status as
well.
