ASoC: AMD: Do not generate interrups for every captured sample

On capture, audio data is first copied from I2S to ACP memory, and then
from ACP to SYSRAM.  The I2S_TO_ACP_DMA interrupt fires on every sample
transferred from I2S to ACP memory.  That is it fires ~48000 times per
second when capturing @ 48 kHz.  Since we don't do anything on this
interrupt anyway, disable it to save quite a few unnecessary interrupts.
The real "work" (calling snd_pcm_period_elapsed()) is done when transfer
from ACP to SYSRAM is complete.
