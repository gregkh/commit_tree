drm/msm: Add a helper function to parse clock names

Add a helper function to parse the clock names and set up
the bulk data so we can take advantage of the bulk clock
functions instead of rolling our own. This is added
as a helper function so the upcoming a6xx GMU code can
also take advantage of it.
