net: mvpp2: improve the distribution of packets on CPUs when using RSS

This patch adds an extra indirection when setting the indirection table
into the RSS hardware table to improve the packets distribution across
CPUs. For example, if 2 queues are used on a multi-core system this new
indirection will choose two queues on two different CPUs instead of the
two first queues which are on the same first CPU.
