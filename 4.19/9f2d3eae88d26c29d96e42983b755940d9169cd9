can: ucan: add driver for Theobroma Systems UCAN devices

The UCAN driver supports the microcontroller-based USB/CAN
adapters from Theobroma Systems. There are two form-factors
that run essentially the same firmware:

* Seal: standalone USB stick ( https://www.theobroma-systems.com/seal )

* Mule: integrated on the PCB of various System-on-Modules from
  Theobroma Systems like the A31-ÂµQ7 and the RK3399-Q7
  ( https://www.theobroma-systems.com/rk3399-q7 )

The USB wire protocol has been designed to be as generic and
hardware-indendent as possible in the hope of being useful for
implementation on other microcontrollers.
