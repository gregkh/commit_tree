r8169: set RxConfig after tx/rx is enabled for RTL8169sb/8110sb devices

I have two Ethernet adapters:
  r8169 0000:03:01.0 eth0: RTL8169sb/8110sb, 00:14:d1:14:2d:49, XID 10000000, IRQ 18
  r8169 0000:01:00.0 eth0: RTL8168e/8111e, 64:66:b3:11:14:5d, XID 2c200000, IRQ 30
And after upgrading from linux 4.15 [1] to linux 4.18+ [2] RTL8169sb failed to
receive any packets. tcpdump shows a lot of checksum mismatch.

  [1]: a0f79386a4968b4925da6db2d1daffd0605a4402
  [2]: 0519359784328bfa92bf0931bf0cff3b58c16932 (4.19 merge window opened)

I started bisecting and the found that [3] breaks it. According to [4]:
  "For 8110S, 8110SB, and 8110SC series, the initial value of RxConfig
  needs to be set after the tx/rx is enabled."
So I moved rtl_init_rxcfg() after enabling tx/rs and now my adapter works
(RTL8168e works too).

  [4]: e542a2269f232d61270ceddd42b73a4348dee2bb ("r8169: adjust the RxConfig
settings.")

Also drop "rx" from rtl_set_rx_tx_config_registers(), since it does nothing
with it already.

rtl_hw_start_8169")
