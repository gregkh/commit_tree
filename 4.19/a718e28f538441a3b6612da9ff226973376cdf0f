mm/fadvise.c: fix signed overflow UBSAN complaint

Signed integer overflow is undefined according to the C standard.  The
overflow in ksys_fadvise64_64() is deliberate, but since it is signed
overflow, UBSAN complains:

	UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in mm/fadvise.c:76:10
	signed integer overflow:
	4 + 9223372036854775805 cannot be represented in type 'long long int'

Use unsigned types to do math.  Unsigned overflow is defined so UBSAN
will not complain about it.  This patch doesn't change generated code.
