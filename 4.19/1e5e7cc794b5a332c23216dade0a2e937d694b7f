dt-bindings: pwm-backlight: Add a num-interpolation-steps property

The num-interpolated-steps property specifies the number of
interpolated steps between each value of brightness-level table. This is
useful for high resolution PWMs to not have to list out every possible
value in the brightness-level array.
