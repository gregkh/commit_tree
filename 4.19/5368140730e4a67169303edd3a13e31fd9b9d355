net: sched: fix notifications for action-held chains

Chains that only have action references serve as placeholders.
Until a non-action reference is created, user should not be aware
of the chain. Also he should not receive any notifications about it.
So send notifications for the new chain only in case the chain gets
the first non-action reference. Symmetrically to that, when
the last non-action reference is dropped, send the notification about
deleted chain.
