perf record: Use unmapped IP for inline callchain cursors

Only use the mapped IP to find inline frames, but keep using the
unmapped IP for the callchain cursor. This ensures we properly show the
unmapped IP when displaying a frame we received via the
dso__parse_addr_inlines API for a module which does not contain
sufficient debug symbols to show the srcline.

This is another follow-up to commit 19610184693c ("perf script: Show
virtual addresses instead of offsets").
