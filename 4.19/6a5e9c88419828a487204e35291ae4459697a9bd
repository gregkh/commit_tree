IB/uverbs: Move non driver related elements from ib_ucontext to ib_ufile

The IDR is part of the ib_ufile so all the machinery to lock it, handle
closing and disassociation rightly belongs to the ufile not the ucontext.

This changes the lifetime of that data to match the lifetime of the file
descriptor which is always strictly longer than the lifetime of the
ucontext.

We need the entire locking machinery to continue to exist after ucontext
destruction to allow us to return the destroy data after a device has been
disassociated.
