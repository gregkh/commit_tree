net/mlx5: FW tracer, create trace buffer and copy strings database

For each PF do the following:
1- Allocate memory for the tracer strings database and read the
strings from the FW to the SW. These strings will be used later for
parsing traces.
2- Allocate and dma map tracer buffers.

Traces that will be written into the buffer will be parsed as a group
of one or more traces, referred to as trace message. The trace message
represents a C-like printf string.
First trace of a message holds the pointer to the correct string in
strings database. The following traces holds the variables of the
message.
