drm/amd/display: DPP CM ICSC AYCRCB8888 format support

[why]
Diags has POR to run the video workload using AYCRCB8888 through DCN;
capture it through DWB and send it to VCN hardware to encode

[how]
added the code to support this format so that DPP ICSC will be able to
convert it from YUV444 to internal RGB and DWB OCSC will be able to
convert from internal RGB to YUV420
