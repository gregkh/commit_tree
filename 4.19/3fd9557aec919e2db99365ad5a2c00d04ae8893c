NFSD: Refactor the generic write vector fill helper

fill_in_write_vector() is nearly the same logic as
svc_fill_write_vector(), but there are a few differences so that
the former can handle multiple WRITE payloads in a single COMPOUND.

svc_fill_write_vector() can be adjusted so that it can be used in
the NFSv4 WRITE code path too. Instead of assuming the pages are
coming from rq_args.pages, have the caller pass in the page list.

The immediate benefit is a reduction of code duplication. It also
prevents the NFSv4 WRITE decoder from passing an empty vector
element when the transport has provided the payload in the xdr_buf's
page array.
