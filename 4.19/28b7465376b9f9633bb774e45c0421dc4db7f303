s390/kdump: Remove kzalloc_panic

For this function there are only two users, when 1) the elfcorehdr and 2)
the vmcoreinfo is allocated. However a missing vmcoreinfo is not critical
for kdump. So panicking when it cannot be allocated is not required.

Remove kzalloc_panic and adjust its callers accordingly.
