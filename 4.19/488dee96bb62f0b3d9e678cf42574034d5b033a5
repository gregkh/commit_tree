kernfs: allow creating kernfs objects with arbitrary uid/gid

This change allows creating kernfs files and directories with arbitrary
uid/gid instead of always using GLOBAL_ROOT_UID/GID by extending
kernfs_create_dir_ns() and kernfs_create_file_ns() with uid/gid arguments.
The "simple" kernfs_create_file() and kernfs_create_dir() are left alone
and always create objects belonging to the global root.

When creating symlinks ownership (uid/gid) is taken from the target kernfs
object.
