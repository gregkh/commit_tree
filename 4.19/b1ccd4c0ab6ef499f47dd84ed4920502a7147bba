net: hns: fix skb->truesize underestimation

skb->truesize is not meant to be tracking amount of used bytes in a skb,
but amount of reserved/consumed bytes in memory.

For instance, if we use a single byte in last page fragment, we have to
account the full size of the fragment.

So skb_add_rx_frag needs to calculate the length of the entire buffer into
turesize.
