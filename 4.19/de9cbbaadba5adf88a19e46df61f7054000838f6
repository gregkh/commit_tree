bpf: introduce cgroup storage maps

This commit introduces BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGROUP_STORAGE maps:
a special type of maps which are implementing the cgroup storage.

>From the userspace point of view it's almost a generic
hash map with the (cgroup inode id, attachment type) pair
used as a key.

The only difference is that some operations are restricted:
  1) a user can't create new entries,
  2) a user can't remove existing entries.

The lookup from userspace is o(log(n)).
