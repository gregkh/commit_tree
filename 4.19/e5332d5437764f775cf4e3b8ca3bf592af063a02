gpiolib: don't allow userspace to set values of input lines

User space can currently both read and set values of input lines using
the character device. This was not allowed by the old sysfs interface
nor is it a correct behavior.

Check the first descriptor in the set for the OUT flag when asked to
set values and return -EPERM if the line is input.
