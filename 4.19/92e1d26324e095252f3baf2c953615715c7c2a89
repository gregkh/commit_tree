drm/doc: polish for sturct drm_connector

- switch everything over to inline comments
- add notes about locking, links to functions and other related stuff
- also include a note about Ville's soon-to-be-merged
  drm_connector_for_each_possible_encoder().

Also check that all the hyperlinks in drm_connector.h work and fix
them as needed.
