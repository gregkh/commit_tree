usb: typec: fix dereference before null check on adev

Pointer adev is being dereferenced before it is being sanity
checked with a null pointer check, hence it is possible for
a null pointer dereference to occur.  Fix this by dereferencing
adev only once it is null checked.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1471598 ("Dereference before null check")
