x86/intel_rdt: Support creation/removal of pseudo-locked region

The user triggers the creation of a pseudo-locked region when writing a
valid schemata to the schemata file of a resource group in the
pseudo-locksetup mode.

A valid schemata is one that: (1) does not overlap with any other resource
group, (2) does not involve a cache that already contains a pseudo-locked
region within its hierarchy.

After a valid schemata is parsed the system is programmed to associate the
to be pseudo-lock bitmask with the closid associated with the resource
group. With the system set up the pseudo-locked region can be created.
