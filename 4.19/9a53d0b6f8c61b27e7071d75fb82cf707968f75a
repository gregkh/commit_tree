wil6210: remove crash dump collection from OTP section

In some cases where the device is stuck, reading from OTP
can timeout. As OTP section is known there is no need to read
it during device crash dump collection.
Adding a new field to struct fw_map to indicate if to include
this section in crash dump collection.
