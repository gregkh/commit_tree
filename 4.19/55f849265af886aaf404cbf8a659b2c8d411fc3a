arm64: convert compat wrappers to C

In preparation for converting to pt_regs syscall wrappers, convert our
existing compat wrappers to C. This will allow the pt_regs wrappers to
be automatically generated, and will allow for the compat register
manipulation to be folded in with the pt_regs accesses.

To avoid confusion with the upcoming pt_regs wrappers and existing
compat wrappers provided by core code, the C wrappers are renamed to
compat_sys_aarch32_<syscall>.

With the assembly wrappers gone, we can get rid of entry32.S and the
associated boilerplate.

Note that these must call the ksys_* syscall entry points, as the usual
sys_* entry points will be modified to take a single pt_regs pointer
argument.
