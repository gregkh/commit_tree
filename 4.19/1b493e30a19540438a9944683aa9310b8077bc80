iwlwifi: pcie: allocate and free rx cr's and tr's tails

The hw now refers to two new blocks:
* rx tr tail - The Tail index on the free buffers queue TR,
which is update by the device after reading the free buffer
from the tr.
* rx cr tail - Updated by the driver when completing
processing a new completion descriptor in the cr.

Add these two new struct to the rxq, allocate and free them
when needed.

In addition, the register for rx write pointer had been changed
to HBUS_TARG_WRPTR. The way to differentiate tx from rx is the
queue number. TX range is 0-511, and RX's is 512-527.
