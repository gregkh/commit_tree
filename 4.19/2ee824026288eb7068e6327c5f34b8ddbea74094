iwlwifi: pcie: support context information for 22560 devices

Context information structure was added to 22000 devices for
firmware self init.

In the next generation of devices the context information
changes significantly, and the original context information
is divided roughly to three data structures: context information gen3,
prph information and prph scratch.

In addition, the init flow changes so the firmware is loaded
by the IML, and so we must allocate the IML on the DRAM and
give the ROM the IML's address before kicking the firmware's
self init.
