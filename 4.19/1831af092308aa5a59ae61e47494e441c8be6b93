media: Revert "[media] tvp5150: fix pad format frame height"

This reverts commit 0866df8dffd514185bfab0d205db76e4c02cf1e4.

The v4l uAPI documentation [0] makes clear that in the case of interlaced
video (i.e: field is V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE) the height refers to the number
of lines in the field and not the number of lines in the full frame (which
is twice the field height for interlaced formats).

So the original height calculation was correct, and it shouldn't had been
changed by the mentioned commit.
