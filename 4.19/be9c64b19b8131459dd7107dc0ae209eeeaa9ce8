mlxsw: spectrum_router: avoid uninitialized variable access

When CONFIG_BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING is disabled, gcc correctly points out
that the 'vid' variable is uninitialized whenever br_vlan_get_pvid
returns an error:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c: In function 'mlxsw_sp_rif_vlan_fid_get':
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c:6881:6: error: 'vid' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This changes the condition check to always return -EINVAL here,
which I guess is what the author intended here.
