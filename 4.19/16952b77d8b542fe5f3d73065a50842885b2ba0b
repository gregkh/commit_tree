kconfig: make syncconfig update .config regardless of sym_change_count

syncconfig updates the .config only when sym_change_count > 0, i.e.
any change in config symbols has been detected.

Not only symbols but also comments are contained in the .config file.
If only comments are updated, they are not fed back to the .config,
then the stale comments are left-over.  Of course, this is just a
matter of comments, but why not fix it.

I see some scenarios where this happens.

Scenario A:

 1. You have a source tree that has already been configured.

 2. Linus increments the version number in the top-level Makefile
    (i.e. he commits a new release)

 3. You pull it, and run 'make'

 4. syncconfig is invoked because the environment variable,
    KERNELVERSION is updated, but the .config is not updated since
    no config symbol is changed.

 5. The .config file contains a kernel version in the top line:

    # Automatically generated file; DO NOT EDIT.
    # Linux/arm64 4.18.0-rc2 Kernel Configuration

    ... which points to a previous version.

Scenario B:

 1. You have a source tree that has already been configured.

 2. You upgrade the compiler, but it still has the same version number.
    This may happen if you regularly build the latest compiler from
    the source code.

 3. You run 'make'

 4. syncconfig is invoked because the environment variable,
    CC_VERSION_TEXT is updated, but the .config is not updated since
    no config symbol is changed.

 5. The .config file contains the version string of the compiler:

    #
    # Compiler: aarch64-linux-gcc (GCC) 9.0.0 20180628 (experimental)
    #

    ... which carries the information of the old compiler.

If KCONFIG_NOSILENTUPDATE is set, syncconfig is not allowed to update
the .config file.  Otherwise, it is fine to update it regardless of
sym_change_count.
