xfrm: use time64_t for in-kernel timestamps

The lifetime managment uses '__u64' timestamps on the user space
interface, but 'unsigned long' for reading the current time in the kernel
with get_seconds().

While this is probably safe beyond y2038, it will still overflow in 2106,
and the get_seconds() call is deprecated because fo that.

This changes the xfrm time handling to use time64_t consistently, along
with reading the time using the safer ktime_get_real_seconds(). It still
suffers from problems that can happen from a concurrent settimeofday()
call or (to a lesser degree) a leap second update, but since the time
stamps are part of the user API, there is nothing we can do to prevent
that.
