s390/mm: correct allocate_pgste proc_handler callback

Since proc_dointvec does not perform value range control,
proc_dointvec_minmax should be used to limit value range, which is
clearly intended here, as the internal representation of the value:

unsigned int alloc_pgste:1;

In fact it currently works, since we have

      mm->context.alloc_pgste = page_table_allocate_pgste || ...

... since commit 23fefe119ceb5 ("s390/kvm: avoid global config of vm.alloc_pgste=1")

Before that it was

       mm->context.alloc_pgste = page_table_allocate_pgste;

which was broken. That was introduced with commit 0b46e0a3ec0d7 ("s390/kvm:
remove delayed reallocation of page tables for KVM").
