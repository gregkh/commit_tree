net: mvpp2: explicitly include linux/interrupt.h

The Marvell PPv2 driver uses interrupts and tasklet but does not
explicitly include linux/interrupt.h, relying on implicit includes. This
one particularly is included by chance after a long unlogical chain of
inclusions. Fix this so we do not get future build breaks.
