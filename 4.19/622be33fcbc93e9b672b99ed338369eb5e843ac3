rcutorture: Use monotonic timestamp for stall detection

The get_seconds() call is deprecated because it overflows on 32-bit
architectures. The algorithm in rcu_torture_stall() can deal with
the overflow, but another problem here is that using a CLOCK_REALTIME
stamp can lead to a false-positive stall warning when a settimeofday()
happens concurrently.

Using ktime_get_seconds() instead avoids those issues and will never
overflow. The added cast to 'unsigned long' however is necessary to
make ULONG_CMP_LT() work correctly.
