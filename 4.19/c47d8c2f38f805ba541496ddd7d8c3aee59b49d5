net: Clear skb->tstamp only on the forwarding path

This is done in preparation for the upcoming time based transmission
patchset. Now that skb->tstamp will be used to hold packet's txtime,
we must ensure that it is being cleared when traversing namespaces.
Also, doing that from skb_scrub_packet() before the early return would
break our feature when tunnels are used.
