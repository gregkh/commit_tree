tracing: Avoid calling cc-option -mrecord-mcount for every Makefile

Currently if CONFIG_FTRACE_MCOUNT_RECORD is enabled -mrecord-mcount
compiler flag support is tested for every Makefile.

Top 4 cc-option usages:
    511 -mrecord-mcount
     11  -fno-stack-protector
      9 -Wno-override-init
      2 -fsched-pressure

To address that move cc-option from scripts/Makefile.build to top Makefile
and export CC_USING_RECORD_MCOUNT to be used in original place.

While doing that also add -mrecord-mcount to CC_FLAGS_FTRACE (if gcc
actually supports it).
