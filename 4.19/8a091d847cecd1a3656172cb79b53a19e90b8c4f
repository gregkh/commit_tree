coresight: Add helper device type

Add a new coresight device type, which do not belong to any
of the existing types, i.e, source, sink, link etc. A helper
device could be connected to a coresight device, which could
augment the functionality of the coresight device.

This is intended to cover Coresight Address Translation Unit (CATU)
devices, which provide improved Scatter Gather mechanism for TMC
ETR. The idea is that the helper device could be controlled by
the driver of the device it is attached to (in this case ETR),
transparent to the generic coresight driver (and paths).

The operations include enable(), disable(), both of which could
accept a device specific "data" which the driving device and
the helper device could share. Since they don't appear in the
coresight "path" tracked by software, we have to ensure that
they are powered up/down whenever the master device is turned
on.
