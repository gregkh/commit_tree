net: expose sk wmem in sock_exceed_buf_limit tracepoint

Currently trace_sock_exceed_buf_limit() only show rmem info,
but wmem limit may also be hit.
So expose wmem info in this tracepoint as well.

Regarding memcg, I think it is better to introduce a new tracepoint(if
that is needed), i.e. trace_memcg_limit_hit other than show memcg info in
trace_sock_exceed_buf_limit.
