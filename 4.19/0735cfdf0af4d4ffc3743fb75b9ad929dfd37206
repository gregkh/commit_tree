drm/mali-dp: Improve writeback handling for DP500.

Mali DP500 operates in continuous writeback mode (writes frame content
until stopped) and it needs special handling in order to behave like
a one-shot writeback engine. The original state machine added for DP500
was a bit fragile, as it did not handle correctly cases where a new
atomic commit was in progress when the SE IRQ happens and it would
commit some partial updates.

Improve the handling by adding a parameter to the set_config_valid()
function to clear the config valid bit in hardware before starting a
new commit and by introducing a MW_RESTART state in the writeback
state machine to cater for the case where a new writeback commit
gets submitted while the last one is still being active.
