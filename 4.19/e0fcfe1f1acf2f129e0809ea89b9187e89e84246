hpfs: remove unnecessary checks on the value of r when assigning error code

At the point where r is being checked for different values, r is always
going to be equal to 2 as the previous if statements jump to end or end1
if r is not 2.  Hence the assignment to err can be simplified to just
err an assignment without any checks on the value or r.
