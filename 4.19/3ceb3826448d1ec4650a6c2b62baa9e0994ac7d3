HID: multitouch: store a per application quirks value

If a device has more than one multitouch collection, there is a chance
we need per tool quirks. This is the case for the Totem on the Dell
Canvas.

Note that thesysfs attribute quirks can now get out of sync, but there
should not be much users of it as it's debugging only.
