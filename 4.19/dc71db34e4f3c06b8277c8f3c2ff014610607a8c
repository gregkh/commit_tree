rxrpc: Fix checks as to whether we should set up a new call

There's a check in rxrpc_data_ready() that's checking the CLIENT_INITIATED
flag in the packet type field rather than in the packet flags field.

Fix this by creating a pair of helper functions to check whether the packet
is going to the client or to the server and use them generally.
