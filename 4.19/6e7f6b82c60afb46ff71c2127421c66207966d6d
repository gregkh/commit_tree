tty: hvc: hvc_poll() fix read loop hang

Commit ec97eaad1383 ("tty: hvc: hvc_poll() break hv read loop") causes
the virtio console to hang at times (e.g., if you paste a bunch of
characters to it.

The reason is that get_chars must return 0 before we can be sure the
driver will kick or poll input again, but this change only scheduled a
poll if get_chars had returned a full count. Change this to poll on
any > 0 count.
