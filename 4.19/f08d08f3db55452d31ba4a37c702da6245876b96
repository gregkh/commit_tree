powerpc/mm/radix: Only need the Nest MMU workaround for R -> RW transition

The Nest MMU workaround is only needed for RW upgrades. Avoid doing
that for other PTE updates.

We also avoid clearing the PTE while marking it invalid. This is
because other page table walkers will find this PTE none and can
result in unexpected behaviour due to that. Instead we clear
_PAGE_PRESENT and set the software PTE bit _PAGE_INVALID.
pte_present() is already updated to check for both bits. This makes
sure page table walkers will find the PTE present and things like
pte_pfn(pte) returns the right value.
