kvm: selftests: add cr4_cpuid_sync_test

KVM is supposed to update some guest VM's CPUID bits (e.g. OSXSAVE) when
CR4 is changed. A bug was found in KVM recently and it was fixed by
Commit c4d2188206ba ("KVM: x86: Update cpuid properly when CR4.OSXAVE or
CR4.PKE is changed"). This patch adds a test to verify the synchronization
between guest VM's CR4 and CPUID bits.
