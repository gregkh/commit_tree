ovl: Copy up meta inode data from lowest data inode

So far lower could not be a meta inode.  So whenever it was time to copy up
data of a meta inode, we could copy it up from top most lower dentry.

But now lower itself can be a metacopy inode.  That means data copy up
needs to take place from a data inode in metacopy inode chain.  Find lower
data inode in the chain and use that for data copy up.

Introduced a helper called ovl_path_lowerdata() to find the lower data
inode chain.
