PCI: vmd: White list for fast interrupt handlers

Devices with slow interrupt handlers are significantly harming
performance when their interrupt vector is shared with a fast device.

Create a class code white list for devices with known fast interrupt
handlers and let all other devices share a single vector so that they
don't interfere with performance.

At the moment, only the NVM Express class code is on the list, but more
may be added if VMD users desire to use other low-latency devices in
these domains.
