drm/i915/gtt: Only keep gen6 page directories pinned while active

In order to be able to evict the gen6 ppgtt, we have to unpin it at some
point. We can simply use our context activity tracking to know when the
ppgtt is no longer in use by hardware, and so only keep it pinned while
being used a request.

For the kernel_context (and thus aliasing_ppgtt), it remains pinned at
all times, as the kernel_context itself is pinned at all times.
