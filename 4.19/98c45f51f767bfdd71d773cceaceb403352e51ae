selftests/powerpc/64: Test all paths through copy routines

The hand-coded assembler 64-bit copy routines include feature sections
that select one code path or another depending on which CPU we are
executing on.  The self-tests for these copy routines end up testing
just one path.  This adds a mechanism for selecting any desired code
path at compile time, and makes 2 or 3 versions of each test, each
using a different code path, so as to cover all the possible paths.
