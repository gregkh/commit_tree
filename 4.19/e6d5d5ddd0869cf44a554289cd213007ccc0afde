IB/uverbs: Clarify and revise uverbs_close_fd

The locking requirements here have changed slightly now that we can rely
on the ib_uverbs_file always existing and containing all the necessary
locking infrastructure.

That means we can get rid of the cleanup_mutex usage (this was protecting
the check on !uboj->context).

Otherwise, follow the same pattern that IDR uses for destroy, acquire
exclusive write access, then call destroy and the undo the 'lookup'.
