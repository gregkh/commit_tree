smb3: display bytes_read and bytes_written in smb3 stats

We were only displaying bytes_read and bytes_written in cifs
stats, fix smb3 stats to also display them.  Sample output
with this patch:

    cat /proc/fs/cifs/Stats:

CIFS Session: 1

SMB Request/Response Buffer: 1 Pool size: 5
SMB Small Req/Resp Buffer: 1 Pool size: 30

Total vfs operations: 94 maximum at one time: 2
