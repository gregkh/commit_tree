qmi_wwan: set DTR for modems in forced USB2 mode

Recent firmware revisions have added the ability to force
these modems to USB2 mode, hiding their SuperSpeed
capabilities from the host.  The driver has been using the
SuperSpeed capability, as shown by the bcdUSB field of the
device descriptor, to detect the need to enable the DTR
quirk.  This method fails when the modems are forced to
USB2 mode by the modem firmware.

Fix by unconditionally enabling the DTR quirk for the
affected device IDs.
