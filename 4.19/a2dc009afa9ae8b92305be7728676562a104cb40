powerpc/mm/book3s/radix: Add mapping statistics

Add statistics that show how memory is mapped within the kernel linear mapping.
This is similar to commit 37cd944c8d8f ("s390/pgtable: add mapping statistics")

We don't do this with Hash translation mode. Hash uses one size (mmu_linear_psize)
to map the kernel linear mapping and we print the linear psize during boot as
below.

"Page orders: linear mapping = 24, virtual = 16, io = 16, vmemmap = 24"

A sample output looks like:

DirectMap4k:           0 kB
DirectMap64k:       18432 kB
DirectMap2M:     1030144 kB
DirectMap1G:    11534336 kB
