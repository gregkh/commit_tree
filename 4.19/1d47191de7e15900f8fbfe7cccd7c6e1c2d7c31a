KVM: arm/arm64: Fix vgic init race

The vgic_init function can race with kvm_arch_vcpu_create() which does
not hold kvm_lock() and we therefore have no synchronization primitives
to ensure we're doing the right thing.

As the user is trying to initialize or run the VM while at the same time
creating more VCPUs, we just have to refuse to initialize the VGIC in
this case rather than silently failing with a broken VCPU.
