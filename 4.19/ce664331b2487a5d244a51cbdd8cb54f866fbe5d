vmw_balloon: VMCI_DOORBELL_SET does not check status

When vmballoon_vmci_init() sets a doorbell using VMCI_DOORBELL_SET, for
some reason it does not consider the status and looks at the result.
However, the hypervisor does not update the result - it updates the
status. This might cause VMCI doorbell not to be enabled, resulting in
degraded performance.
