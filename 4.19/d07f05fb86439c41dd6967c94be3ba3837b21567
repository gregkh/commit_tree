hwmon: rpi: add module alias to raspberrypi-hwmon

The raspberrypi-hwmon driver doesn't automatically load, although it does work
when loaded, by adding the alias it auto loads as expected when built as a
module. Tested on RPi2/RPi3 on 32 bit kernel and RPi3B+ on aarch64 with
Fedora 28 and a patched 4.18 RC kernel.
