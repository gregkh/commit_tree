    dma-buf/fence: add fence_wait_any_timeout function v2

there was a restriction added that this only works if the dma-fence
uses the dma_fence_default_wait hook. Which works for amdgpu, which is
the only caller. Well, until you share some buffers with e.g. i915,
then you get an -EINVAL.

But there's really no reason for this, because all drivers must
support callbacks. The special ->wait hook is only as an optimization;
if the driver needs to create a worker thread for an active callback,
then it can avoid to do that if it knows that there's a process
context available already. So ->wait is just an optimization, just
using the logic in dma_fence_default_wait() should work for all
drivers.

Let's remove this restriction.
