drm/i915: "Race-to-idle" after switching to the kernel context

During suspend we want to flush out all active contexts and their
rendering. To do so we queue a request from the kernel's context, once
we know that request is done, we know the GPU is completely idle. To
speed up that switch bump the GPU clocks.

Switching to the kernel context prior to idling is also used to enforce
a barrier before changing OA properties, and when evicting active
rendering from the global GTT. All cases where we do want to
race-to-idle.

v2: Limit the boosting to only the switch before suspend.
v3: Limit it to the wait-for-idle on suspend.
