udlfb: make a local copy of fb_ops

The defio subsystem overwrites the method fb_osp->mmap. That method is
stored in module's static data - and that means that if we have multiple
diplaylink adapters, they will over write each other's method.

In order to avoid interference between multiple adapters, we copy the
fb_ops structure to a device-local memory.
