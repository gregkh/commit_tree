ACPI / button: increment wakeup count only when notified

Because acpi_lid_initialize_state() is called on every system
resume and it triggers acpi_lid_notify_state() which invokes
acpi_pm_wakeup_event() for the lid device, the lid's wakeup count is
incremented even if the lid was not the source of the event that woke up
the system. That behavior confuses user space deamons using
wakeup_count to identify the potential system wakeup source. To avoid
the confusion, only trigger acpi_pm_wakeup_event() in the
acpi_button_notify() path and don't do that in the
acpi_lid_initialize_state() path.
