staging:rtl8192u: Remove member variable Enable - Style

The structure dynamic_rx_path_sel defines a member variable 'Enable'
which is initialised and later tested. The variable is however never
changed to the test is redundant and the member variable is then never
used.

The member variable, initialisation and test have all been removed.

This is a coding style change which should not impact runtime code
execution.
