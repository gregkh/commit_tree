crypto: testmgr - add hash finup tests

The testmgr hash tests were testing init, digest, update and final
methods but not the finup method. Add a test for this one too.

While doing this, make sure we only run the partial tests once with
the digest tests and skip them with the final and finup tests since
they are the same.
