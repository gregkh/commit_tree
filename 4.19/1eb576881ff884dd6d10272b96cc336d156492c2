ASoC: apq8096: remove auto rebinding

Remove auto rebinding support, as component framework can deadlock
in few usecases if we are trying to add new/remove component within
a bind/unbind callbacks.

Card rebinding is ASoC core feature so all the previous component
framework stuff in q6dsp remains removed.
