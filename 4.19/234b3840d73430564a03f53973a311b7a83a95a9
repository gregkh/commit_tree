tick/broadcast-hrtimer: Use cpu_possible_mask for ce_broadcast_hrtimer

This is the last instance of cpu_all_mask usage in the core framework.

Replace it with cpu_possible_mask like all other instances in the
clockevent drivers. This makes it possible to add a warning in the core
clockevents_register_device on usage of cpu_all_mask from any clockevent
drivers in the future.
