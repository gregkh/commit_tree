serial: mvebu-uart: Fix reporting of effective CSIZE to userspace

Apparently, this driver (or the hardware) does not support character
length settings. It's apparently running in 8-bit mode, but it makes
userspace believe it's in 5-bit mode. That makes tcsetattr with CS8
incorrectly fail, breaking e.g. getty from busybox, thus the login shell
on ttyMVx.

Fix by hard-wiring CS8 into c_cflag.
