netfilter: doc: Add nf_tables part in tproxy.txt

Recently, transparent proxy support has been added to nf_tables so that
this document should be updated with the new information.

- Nft commands are added as alternatives to iptables ones.
- The link for a patched iptables is removed as it is already part of
  the mainline iptables implementation (and the link is dead).
- tcprdr is added as an example implementation of a transparent proxy
