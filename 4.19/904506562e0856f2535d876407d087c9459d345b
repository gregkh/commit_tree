tools/vm/slabinfo.c: fix sign-compare warning

Currently we get the following compiler warning:

    slabinfo.c:854:22: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Wsign-compare]
       if (s->object_size < min_objsize)
                          ^

due to the mismatch of signed/unsigned comparison.  ->object_size and
->slab_size are never expected to be negative, so let's define them as
unsigned int.
