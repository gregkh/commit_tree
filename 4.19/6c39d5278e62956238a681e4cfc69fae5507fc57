net: hns3: Fix for command format parsing error in hclge_is_all_function_id_zero

According to the functional specification of hardware, the first
descriptor of response from command 'lookup vlan talbe' is not valid.
Currently, the first descriptor is parsed as normal value, which will
cause an expected error.

This patch fixes this problem by skipping the first descriptor.
