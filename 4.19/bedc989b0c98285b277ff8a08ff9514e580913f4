net/mlx4_core: Add Crdump FW snapshot support

Crdump allows the driver to create a snapshot of the FW PCI
crspace and health buffer during a critical FW issue.
In case of a FW command timeout, FW getting stuck or a non zero
value on the catastrophic buffer, a snapshot will be taken.

The snapshot is exposed using devlink, cr-space, fw-health
address regions are registered on init and snapshots are attached
once a new snapshot is collected by the driver.
