xfs: use ->t_dfops for rmap extent swap operations

xfs_swap_extent_rmap() uses a local dfops instance with a
transaction from the caller. Since there is only one caller, pull
the dfops structure into the caller and attach it to the
transaction. This avoids the need to clear ->t_dfops to prevent
invalid stack memory access.
