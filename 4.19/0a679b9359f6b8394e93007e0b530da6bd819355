staging:rtl8192u: Rename members of struct qos_tsinfo - Style

The member variables of struct qos_tsinfo all cause checkpatch issues
with CamelCase naming. As the variables are used in so few places the
changes are combined into this single patch.

Additionally the member variable usReserved is never used in code so
has been removed.

These are all coding style changes which should have no impact on
runtime code execution.
