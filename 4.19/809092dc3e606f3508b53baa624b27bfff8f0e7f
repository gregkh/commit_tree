drivers/perf: arm-ccn: Use devm_ioremap_resource() to map memory

Instead of checking the return value of platform_get_resource(), we can
use devm_ioremap_resource() which has the NULL pointer check and the
memory region requesting. devm_ioremap_resource is designed to replace
calls to devm_request_mem_region followed by devm_ioremap, so let's use
the same.
