cpufreq: intel_pstate: Show different max frequency with turbo 3 and HWP

On HWP platforms with Turbo 3.0, the HWP capability max ratio shows the
maximum ratio of that core, which can be different than other cores. If
we show the correct maximum frequency in cpufreq sysfs via
cpuinfo_max_freq and scaling_max_freq then, user can know which cores
can run faster for pinning some high priority tasks.

Currently the max turbo frequency is shown as max frequency, which is
the max of all cores, even if some cores can't reach that frequency
even for single threaded workload.

But it is possible that max ratio in HWP capabilities is set as 0xFF or
some high invalid value (E.g. One KBL NUC). Since the actual performance
can never exceed 1 core turbo frequency from MSR TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT, we
use this as a bound check.
