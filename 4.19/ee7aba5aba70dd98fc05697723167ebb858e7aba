mei: hbm: define dma ring setup protocol

The protocol defines how to setup an I/O ring on top of host
memory to utilize the device DMA engine for faster transport.

Three memory buffers are allocated.
A Host circular buffer for from the Host to Device communication.
A Device circular buffer for from Device to the Host communication.
And finally a Control block where the pointers for the both
circular buffers are managed.
