fs/ufs: use ktime_get_real_seconds for sb and cg timestamps

get_seconds() is deprecated because of the 32-bit overflow and will be
removed.  All callers in ufs also truncate to a 32-bit number, so
nothing changes during the conversion, but this should be harmless as
the superblock and cylinder group timestamps are not visible to user
space, except for checking the fs-dirty state, wich works fine across
the overflow.

This moves the call to get_seconds() into a new inline function, with a
comment explaining the constraints, while converting it to
ktime_get_real_seconds().
