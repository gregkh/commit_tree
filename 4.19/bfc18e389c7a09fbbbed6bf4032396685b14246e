atomics/treewide: Rename __atomic_add_unless() => atomic_fetch_add_unless()

While __atomic_add_unless() was originally intended as a building-block
for atomic_add_unless(), it's now used in a number of places around the
kernel. It's the only common atomic operation named __atomic*(), rather
than atomic_*(), and for consistency it would be better named
atomic_fetch_add_unless().

This lack of consistency is slightly confusing, and gets in the way of
scripting atomics. Given that, let's clean things up and promote it to
an official part of the atomics API, in the form of
atomic_fetch_add_unless().

This patch converts definitions and invocations over to the new name,
including the instrumented version, using the following script:

  ----
  git grep -w __atomic_add_unless | while read line; do
  sed -i '{s/\<__atomic_add_unless\>/atomic_fetch_add_unless/}' "${line%%:*}";
  done
  git grep -w __arch_atomic_add_unless | while read line; do
  sed -i '{s/\<__arch_atomic_add_unless\>/arch_atomic_fetch_add_unless/}' "${line%%:*}";
  done
  ----

Note that we do not have atomic{64,_long}_fetch_add_unless(), which will
be introduced by later patches.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
