fuse: Don't access pipe->buffers without pipe_lock()

fuse_dev_splice_write() reads pipe->buffers to determine the size of
'bufs' array before taking the pipe_lock(). This is not safe as
another thread might change the 'pipe->buffers' between the allocation
and taking the pipe_lock(). So we end up with too small 'bufs' array.

Move the bufs allocations inside pipe_lock()/pipe_unlock() to fix this.
