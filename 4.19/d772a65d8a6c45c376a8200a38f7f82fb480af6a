Revert "scsi: core: avoid host-wide host_busy counter for scsi_mq"

This reverts commit 328728630d9f2bf14b82ca30b5e47489beefe361.

There is fundamental issue in commit 328728630d9f2bf1 (scsi: core: avoid
host-wide host_busy counter for scsi_mq) because SCSI's host busy counter
may not be same with counter of blk-mq's inflight tags, especially in case
of none io scheduler.

We may switch to other approach for addressing this scsi_mq's performance
issue, such as percpu counter or kind of ways, so revert this commit first
for fixing this kind of issue in EH path, as reported by Jens.
