drm/nouveau: Remove duplicate poll_enable() in pmops_runtime_suspend()

Since actual hotplug notifications don't get disabled until
nouveau_display_fini() is called, all this will do is cause any hotplugs
that happen between this drm_kms_helper_poll_disable() call and the
actual hotplug disablement to potentially be dropped if ACPI isn't
around to help us.
