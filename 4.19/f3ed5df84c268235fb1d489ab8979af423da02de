drm/amdkfd: Consolidate duplicate memory banks info in topology

If there are several memory banks that has the same properties in CRAT,
we aggregate them into one memory bank. This cleans up memory banks on
APUs (e.g. Raven) where the CRAT reports each memory channel as a
separate bank. This only confuses user mode, which only deals with
virtual memory.
