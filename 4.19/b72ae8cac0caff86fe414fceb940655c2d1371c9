PCI: Add PCI_DEVICE_DATA() macro to fully describe device ID entry

There are a lot of examples in the kernel where PCI_VDEVICE() is used and
still looks not so convenient due to additional driver_data field attached.

Introduce PCI_DEVICE_DATA() macro to fully describe device ID entry in
shortest possible form. For example,

  before:

    { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_MRFLD),
      (kernel_ulong_t) &dwc3_pci_mrfld_properties, },

  after:

    { PCI_DEVICE_DATA(INTEL, MRFLD, &dwc3_pci_mrfld_properties) },

Drivers can be converted later on in independent way.

While here, remove the unused macro with the same name from Ralink wireless
driver.
