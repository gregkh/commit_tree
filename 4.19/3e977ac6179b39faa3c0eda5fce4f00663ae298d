drm/i915: Prevent writing into a read-only object via a GGTT mmap

If the user has created a read-only object, they should not be allowed
to circumvent the write protection by using a GGTT mmapping. Deny it.

Also most machines do not support read-only GGTT PTEs, so again we have
to reject attempted writes. Fortunately, this is known a priori, so we
can at least reject in the call to create the mmap (with a sanity check
in the fault handler).

v2: Check the vma->vm_flags during mmap() to allow readonly access.
v3: Remove VM_MAYWRITE to curtail mprotect()
