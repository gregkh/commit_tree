net/mlx5: FW tracer, parse traces and kernel tracing support

For each message the driver should do the following:
1- Find the message string in the strings database
2- Count the param number of each message
3- Wait for the param events and accumulate them
4- Calculate the event timestamp using the local event timestamp
and the first timestamp event following it.
5- Print message to trace log

Enable the tracing by:
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/mlx5/mlx5_fw/enable

Read traces by:
cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
