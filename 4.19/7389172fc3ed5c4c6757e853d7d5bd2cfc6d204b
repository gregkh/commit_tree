ARM: dts: sun8i: h3: Enable dwmac-sun8i on the Beelink X2

The enabling of the EMAC was reverted as there was an issue on how
to handle the integrated PHY and it was getting close to the release
window (fe45174b72ae ("arm: dts: sunxi: Revert EMAC changes")).

When a solution was found, then the changes were restored in
4b236a0fe512 ("arm: dts: sunxi: h3/h5: Restore EMAC changes") and
4904337fe34f ("ARM: dts: sunxi: Restore EMAC changes (boards)").
Unfortunately enabling for the Beelink X2 was missed.

This reverts partially commit 6b0e06df5cad (Revert "ARM: dts:
sun8i: h3: Enable dwmac-sun8i on the Beelink X2")
