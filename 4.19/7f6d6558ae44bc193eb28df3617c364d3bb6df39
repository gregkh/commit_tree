Revert "openvswitch: Fix template leak in error cases."

This reverts commit 90c7afc96cbbd77f44094b5b651261968e97de67.

When the commit was merged, the code used nf_ct_put() to free
the entry, but later on commit 76644232e612 ("openvswitch: Free
tmpl with tmpl_free.") replaced that with nf_ct_tmpl_free which
is a more appropriate. Now the original problem is removed.

Then 44d6e2f27328 ("net: Replace NF_CT_ASSERT() with WARN_ON().")
replaced a debug assert with a WARN_ON() which is trigged now.
