staging:rtl8192u: Remove proxy rtl819XRadioB_Array - Style

Remove the array rtl819XRadioB_Array Rtl8192UsbRadioB_Array which acts
as a proxy the actual array Rtl8192UsbRadioB_Array. The only purpose, I
can see for this implementation is to obscure the actual array being
used Rtl8192UsbRadioB_Array.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
