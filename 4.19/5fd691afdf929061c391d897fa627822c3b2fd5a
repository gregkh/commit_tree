atomic/tty: Fix up atomic abuse in ldsem

Mark found ldsem_cmpxchg() needed an (atomic_long_t *) cast to keep
working after making the atomic_long interface type safe.

Needing casts is bad form, which made me look at the code. There are no
ld_semaphore::count users outside of these functions so there is no
reason why it can not be an atomic_long_t in the first place, obviating
the need for this cast.

That also ensures the loads use atomic_long_read(), which implies (at
least) READ_ONCE() in order to guarantee single-copy-atomic loads.

When using atomic_long_try_cmpxchg() the ldsem_cmpxchg() wrapper gets
very thin (the only difference is not changing *old on success, which
most callers don't seem to care about).

So rework the whole thing to use atomic_long_t and its accessors
directly.

While there, fixup all the horrible comment styles.
