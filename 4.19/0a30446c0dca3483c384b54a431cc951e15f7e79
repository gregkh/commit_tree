i2c: core: ACPI: Make acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes() check i2c_transfer return value

Currently acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes() directly returns i2c_transfer's return
value. i2c_transfer returns a value < 0 on error and 2 (for 2 successfully
executed transfers) on success. But the ACPI code expects 0 on success, so
currently acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes()'s caller does:

        if (status > 0)
                status = 0;

This commit makes acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes() return a value which can be
directly consumed by the ACPI code, mirroring acpi_gsb_i2c_write_bytes(),
this commit also makes acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes() explitcly check that
i2c_transfer returns 2, rather then accepting any value > 0.
