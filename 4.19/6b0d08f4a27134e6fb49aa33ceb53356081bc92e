IB/uverbs: Use uverbs_api to manage the object type inside the uobject

Currently the struct uverbs_obj_type stored in the ib_uobject is part of
the .rodata segment of the module that defines the object. This is a
problem if drivers define new uapi objects as we will be left with a
dangling pointer after device disassociation.

Switch the uverbs_obj_type for struct uverbs_api_object, which is
allocated memory that is part of the uverbs_api and is guaranteed to
always exist. Further this moves the 'type_class' into this memory which
means access to the IDR/FD function pointers is also guaranteed. Drivers
cannot define new types.

This makes it safe to continue to use all uobjects, including driver
defined ones, after disassociation.
