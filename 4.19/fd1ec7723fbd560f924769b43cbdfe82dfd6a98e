KVM: nVMX: remove a misleading comment regarding vmcs02 fields

prepare_vmcs02() has an odd comment that says certain fields are
"not in vmcs02".  AFAICT the intent of the comment is to document
that various VMCS fields are not handled by prepare_vmcs02(),
e.g. HOST_{FS,GS}_{BASE,SELECTOR}.  While technically true, the
comment is misleading, e.g. it can lead the reader to think that
KVM never writes those fields to vmcs02.

Remove the comment altogether as the handling of FS and GS is
not specific to nested VMX, and GUEST_PML_INDEX has been written
by prepare_vmcs02() since commit "4e59516a12a6 (kvm: vmx: ensure
VMCS is current while enabling PML)"
