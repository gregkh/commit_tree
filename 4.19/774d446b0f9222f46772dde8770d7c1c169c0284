PCI: pciehp: Publish to user space last on probe

The PCI hotplug core has just been refactored to separate slot
initialization for in-kernel use from publication to user space.

Take advantage of it in pciehp by publishing to user space last on
probe.  This will allow enable/disablement of the slot exclusively from
the IRQ thread because the IRQ is requested after initialization for
in-kernel use (thereby getting its unique name needed by the IRQ thread)
but before user space is able to submit enable/disable requests.

On teardown, the order is the same in reverse:  The user space interface
is removed prior to freeing the IRQ and destroying the slot.
