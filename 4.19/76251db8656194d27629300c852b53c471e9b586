usb: dwc3: of-simple: reset host controller at suspend/resume

If we power off the SoC logic rail in S3, we can find that the Type-C
PHY can't initialize correctly after system resume. We need to toggle
the USB3-OTG reset before trying to initialize the PHY, or else it
times out.

    phy phy-ff800000.phy.9: phy poweron failed --> -110
    dwc3 fe900000.dwc3: failed to initialize core
    dwc3: probe of fe900000.dwc3 failed with error -110

Note that the RK3399 TRM suggests that we should keep the whole usb3
controller in reset for the duration of the Type-C PHY initialization.
However, it's hard to assert the reset in the current framework of
reset. We're still skeptical about that, and we haven't yet found a
case where this seems to have mattered. This approach is much easier, it
simply holds the USB3-OTG reset while device is supended.

The dwc3 core is going to reinitialize the controller at suspend/resume
anyway (including a "soft reset"), so it should be safe to do this.
