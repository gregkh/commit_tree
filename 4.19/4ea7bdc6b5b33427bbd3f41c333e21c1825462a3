ARM: trusted_foundations: do not use naked function

As documented in GCC naked functions should only use basic ASM
syntax. The extended ASM or mixture of basic ASM and "C" code is
not guaranteed. Currently this works because it was hard coded
to follow and check GCC behavior for arguments and register
placement.

Furthermore with clang using parameters in Extended asm in a
naked function is not supported:
  arch/arm/firmware/trusted_foundations.c:47:10: error: parameter
          references not allowed in naked functions
                : "r" (type), "r" (arg1), "r" (arg2)
                       ^

Use a regular function to be more portable. This aligns also with
the other SMC call implementations e.g. in qcom_scm-32.c and
bcm_kona_smc.c.
