tcp_bbr: fix bbr pacing rate for internal pacing

This commit makes BBR use only the MSS (without any headers) to
calculate pacing rates when internal TCP-layer pacing is used.

This is necessary to achieve the correct pacing behavior in this case,
since tcp_internal_pacing() uses only the payload length to calculate
pacing delays.
