crypto: arm64/ghash-ce - replace NEON yield check with block limit

Checking the TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is disproportionately costly on cores
with fast crypto instructions and comparatively slow memory accesses.

On algorithms such as GHASH, which executes at ~1 cycle per byte on
cores that implement support for 64 bit polynomial multiplication,
there is really no need to check the TIF_NEED_RESCHED particularly
often, and so we can remove the NEON yield check from the assembler
routines.

However, unlike the AEAD or skcipher APIs, the shash/ahash APIs take
arbitrary input lengths, and so there needs to be some sanity check
to ensure that we don't hog the CPU for excessive amounts of time.

So let's simply cap the maximum input size that is processed in one go
to 64 KB.
