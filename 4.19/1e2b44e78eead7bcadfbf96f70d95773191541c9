rds: Enable RDS IPv6 support

This patch enables RDS to use IPv6 addresses. For RDS/TCP, the
listener is now an IPv6 endpoint which accepts both IPv4 and IPv6
connection requests.  RDS/RDMA/IB uses a private data (struct
rds_ib_connect_private) exchange between endpoints at RDS connection
establishment time to support RDMA. This private data exchange uses a
32 bit integer to represent an IP address. This needs to be changed in
order to support IPv6. A new private data struct
rds6_ib_connect_private is introduced to handle this. To ensure
backward compatibility, an IPv6 capable RDS stack uses another RDMA
listener port (RDS_CM_PORT) to accept IPv6 connection. And it
continues to use the original RDS_PORT for IPv4 RDS connections. When
it needs to communicate with an IPv6 peer, it uses the RDS_CM_PORT to
send the connection set up request.

v5: Fixed syntax problem (David Miller).

v4: Changed port history comments in rds.h (Sowmini Varadhan).

v3: Added support to set up IPv4 connection using mapped address
    (David Miller).
    Added support to set up connection between link local and non-link
    addresses.
    Various review comments from Santosh Shilimkar and Sowmini Varadhan.

v2: Fixed bound and peer address scope mismatched issue.
    Added back rds_connect() IPv6 changes.
