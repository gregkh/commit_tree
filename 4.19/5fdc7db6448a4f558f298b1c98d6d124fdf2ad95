module: setup load info before module_sig_check()

We want to be able to log the module name in early error messages, such as
when module signature verification fails.  Previously, the module name is
set in layout_and_allocate(), meaning that any error messages that happen
before (such as those in module_sig_check()) won't be logged with a module
name, which isn't terribly helpful.

In order to do this, reshuffle the order in load_module() and set up
load info earlier so that we can log the module name along with these
error messages. This requires splitting rewrite_section_headers() out of
setup_load_info().

While we're at it, clean up and split up the operations done in
layout_and_allocate(), setup_load_info(), and rewrite_section_headers()
more cleanly so these functions only perform what their names suggest.
