nvmet: add ns write protect support

This patch implements the Namespace Write Protect feature described in
"NVMe TP 4005a Namespace Write Protect". In this version, we implement
No Write Protect and Write Protect states for target ns which can be
toggled by set-features commands from the host side.

For write-protect state transition, we need to flush the ns specified
as a part of command so we also add helpers for carrying out synchronous
flush operations.
