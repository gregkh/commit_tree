ovl: Check redirects for metacopy files

Right now we rely on path based lookup for data origin of metacopy upper.
This will work only if upper has not been renamed.  We solved this problem
already for merged directories using redirect.  Use same logic for metacopy
files.

This patch just goes on to check redirects for metacopy files.
