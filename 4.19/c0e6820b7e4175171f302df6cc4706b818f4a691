net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Disable learning while in WoL

When we are in Wake-on-LAN, we operate with the host sofware not running
a network stack, so we want to the switch to flood packets in order to
cause a system wake-up when matching specific filters (unicast or
multicast). This was not necessary before since we supported Magic
Packet which are targeting a broadcast MAC address which the switch
already floods.
