mfd: axp20x: Add self-working mode support for AXP806

The AXP806 can operate in a standalone "self-working" mode, in which it
is also responsible for power control of the overall system. This mode
is similar to the master mode, but the EN/PWRON pin functions as a power
button, instead of a level-triggered enable switch.

This patch adds code checking for the new "x-powers,self-working-mode"
property, and a separate mfd_cell list that includes the power button
(PEK) sub-device.
