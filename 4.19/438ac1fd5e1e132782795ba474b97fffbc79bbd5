media: imx274: initialize format before v4l2 controls

The current probe function calls v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup() before
initializing the format info. This triggers call paths such as:
imx274_probe -> v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup -> imx274_s_ctrl ->
imx274_set_exposure, where priv->mode_index is accessed before being
assigned.

This is wrong but does not trigger a visible bug because priv is
zero-initialized and 0 is the default value for priv->mode_index. But
this would become a crash in follow-up commits when mode_index is
replaced by a pointer that must always be valid.

Fix the bug before it shows up by initializing struct members early.
