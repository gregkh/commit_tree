media: v4l2-ioctl.c: use correct vb2_queue lock for m2m devices

For m2m devices the vdev->queue lock was always taken instead of the
lock for the specific capture or output queue. Now that we pushed
the locking down into __video_do_ioctl() we can pick the correct
lock and potentially improve the performance of m2m devices.
