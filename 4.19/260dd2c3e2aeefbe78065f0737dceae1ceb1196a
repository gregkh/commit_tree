virtio_net: remove ndo_poll_controller

As diagnosed by Song Liu, ndo_poll_controller() can
be very dangerous on loaded hosts, since the cpu
calling ndo_poll_controller() might steal all NAPI
contexts (for all RX/TX queues of the NIC). This capture
can last for unlimited amount of time, since one
cpu is generally not able to drain all the queues under load.

virto_net uses NAPI for TX completions, so we better let core
networking stack call the napi->poll() to avoid the capture.
