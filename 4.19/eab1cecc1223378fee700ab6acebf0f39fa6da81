arm64: sdei: Mark sdei stack helper functions as static

The SDEI stack helper functions are only used by _on_sdei_stack() and
refer to symbols (e.g. sdei_stack_normal_ptr) that are only defined if
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y.

Mark these functions as static, so we don't run into errors at link-time
due to references to undefined symbols. Stick all the parameters onto
the same line whilst we're passing through.
