xfs: replace no-op firstblock init with ->t_firstblock

xfs_refcount_recover_cow_leftovers() has no need for a firstblock
variable and so passes an unrelated xfs_fsblock_t to
xfs_defer_init() to avoid declaring one. Replace this no-op
initialization with ->t_firstblock. This will be optimized away by
the removal of the xfs_defer_init() firstblock param.
