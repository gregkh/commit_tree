mtd: rawnand: davinci: Stop doing iomem pointer <-> u32 conversions

There is no point in doing this sort of conversion since we can
replace |= by += operations which are perfectly valid on pointers.

This is done in preparation of COMPILE_TEST addition to the NAND_DAVINCI
Kconfig entry, since building for x86 generates several warnings because
of inappropriate u32 <-> void * conversions (pointers are 64-bit large
on x86_64).
