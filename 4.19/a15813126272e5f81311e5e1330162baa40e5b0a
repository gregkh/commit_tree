staging: erofs: introduce erofs shrinker

This patch adds a dedicated shrinker targeting to free unneeded
memory consumed by a number of erofs in-memory data structures.

Like F2FS and UBIFS, it also adds:
  - sbi->umount_mutex to avoid races on shrinker and put_super
  - sbi->shrinker_run_no to not revisit recently scaned objects
