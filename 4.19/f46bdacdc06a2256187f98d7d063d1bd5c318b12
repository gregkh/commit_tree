media: omap2: omapfb: fix bugon.cocci warnings

drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/omapfb/dss/dss_features.c:895:2-5: WARNING: Use BUG_ON instead of if condition followed by BUG.
Please make sure the condition has no side effects (see conditional BUG_ON definition in include/asm-generic/bug.h)

 Use BUG_ON instead of a if condition followed by BUG.

Semantic patch information:
 This makes an effort to find cases where BUG() follows an if
 condition on an expression and replaces the if condition and BUG()
 with a BUG_ON having the conditional expression of the if statement
 as argument.
