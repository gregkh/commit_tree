blk-cgroup: allow controllers to output their own stats

blk-iolatency has a few stats that it would like to print out, and
instead of adding a bunch of crap to the generic code just provide a
helper so that controllers can add stuff to the stat line if they want
to.

Hide it behind a boot option since it changes the output of io.stat from
normal, and these stats are only interesting to developers.
