fpga: dfl: add feature device infrastructure

This patch abstracts the common operations of the sub features and defines
the feature_ops data structure, including init, uinit and ioctl function
pointers. And this patch adds some common helper functions for FME and AFU
drivers, e.g. dfl_feature_dev_use_begin/end which are used to ensure
exclusive usage of the feature device file.
