serial: 8250_dw: always set baud rate in dw8250_set_termios

dw8250_set_termios() doesn't set baud rate if the arg "old ktermios" is
NULL. This happens during resume.
Call Trace:
...
[   54.928108] dw8250_set_termios+0x162/0x170
[   54.928114] serial8250_set_termios+0x17/0x20
[   54.928117] uart_change_speed+0x64/0x160
[   54.928119] uart_resume_port
...

So the baud rate is not restored after S3 and breaks the apps who use
UART, for example, console and bluetooth etc.

We address this issue by setting the baud rate irrespective of arg
"old", just like the drivers for other 8250 IPs. This is tested with
Intel Broxton platform.
