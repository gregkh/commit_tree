bluetooth: hci_qca: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL

qca_open() and qca_set_baudrate() are never called in atomic context.

They call kzalloc() and bt_skb_alloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which is not necessary.
GFP_ATOMIC can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
I also manually check the kernel code before reporting it.
