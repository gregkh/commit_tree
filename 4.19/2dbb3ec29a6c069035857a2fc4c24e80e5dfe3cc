ata: libahci: Correct setting of DEVSLP register

We have seen that on some platforms, SATA device never show any DEVSLP
residency. This prevent power gating of SATA IP, which prevent system
to transition to low power mode in systems with SLP_S0 aka modern
standby systems. The PHY logic is off only in DEVSLP not in slumber.

Section 28.7.6.1

Here driver is trying to do read-modify-write the devslp register. But
not resetting the bits for which this driver will modify values (DITO,
MDAT and DETO). So simply reset those bits before updating to new values.
