perf tools: Check for null when copying nsinfo.

The argument to nsinfo__copy() was assumed to be valid, but some code paths
exist that will lead to NULL being passed.

In particular, running 'perf script -D' on a perf.data file containing an
PERF_RECORD_MMAP event associating the '[vdso]' dso with pid 0 earlier in
the event stream will lead to a segfault.

Since all calling code is already checking for a non-null return value,
just return NULL for this case as well.
