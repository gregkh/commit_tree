drm/i915/kvmgt: Fix potential Spectre v1

info.index can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading
to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/kvmgt.c:1232 intel_vgpu_ioctl() warn:
potential spectre issue 'vgpu->vdev.region' [r]

Fix this by sanitizing info.index before indirectly using it to index
vgpu->vdev.region

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
