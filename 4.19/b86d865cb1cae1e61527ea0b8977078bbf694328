blkcg: Make blkg_root_lookup() work for queues in bypass mode

For legacy queues the only call of blkg_root_lookup() happens after
bypass mode has been enabled. Since blkg_lookup() returns NULL for
queues in bypass mode, modify the blkg_root_lookup() such that it
no longer depends on bypass mode. Rename the function into
blk_queue_root_blkg() as suggested by Tejun.
