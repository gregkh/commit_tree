kprobes: Don't check the ->break_handler() in generic kprobes code

Don't check the ->break_handler() from the core kprobes code,
because it was only used by jprobes which got removed.

( In followup patches we'll remove the remaining calls in low level
  arch handlers as well and remove the callback altogether. )
