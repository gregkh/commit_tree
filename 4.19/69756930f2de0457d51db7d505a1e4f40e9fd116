ALSA: cs5535audio: Fix invalid endian conversion

One place in cs5535audio_build_dma_packets() does an extra conversion
via cpu_to_le32(); namely jmpprd_addr is passed to setup_prd() ops,
which writes the value via cs_writel().  That is, the callback does
the conversion by itself, and we don't need to convert beforehand.

This patch fixes that bogus conversion.
