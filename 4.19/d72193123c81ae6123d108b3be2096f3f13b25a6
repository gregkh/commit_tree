rcutorture: Correctly handle grace-period sequence wrap

The new ->gq_seq grace-period sequence numbers must be shifted down,
which give artifacts when these numbers wrap.  This commit therefore
enables rcutorture and rcuperf to handle grace-period sequence numbers
even if they do wrap.  It does this by allowing a special subtraction
function to be specified, and this function subtracts before shifting.
