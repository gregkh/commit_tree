drm/i915/trace: Describe engines as class:instance pairs

Instead of using the engine->id, use uabi_class:instance pairs in trace-
points including engine info.

This will be more readable, more future proof and more stable for
userspace consumption.

v2:
 * Use u16 for class and instance. (Chris Wilson)
