dm delay: add flush as a third class of IO

Add a new class for dm-delay that delays flush requests.  Previously,
flushes were delayed as writes, but it caused problems if the user
needed to create a device with one or a few slow sectors for the purpose
of testing - all flushes would be forwarded to this device and delayed,
and that skews the test results.  Fix this by allowing to select 0 delay
for flushes.
