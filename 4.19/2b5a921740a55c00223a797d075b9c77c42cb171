udp4: fix IP_CMSG_CHECKSUM for connected sockets

commit 2abb7cdc0dc8 ("udp: Add support for doing checksum
unnecessary conversion") left out the early demux path for
connected sockets. As a result IP_CMSG_CHECKSUM gives wrong
values for such socket when GRO is not enabled/available.

This change addresses the issue by moving the csum conversion to a
common helper and using such helper in both the default and the
early demux rx path.
