rds: RDS (tcp) hangs on sendto() to unresponding address

In rds_send_mprds_hash(), if the calculated hash value is non-zero and
the MPRDS connections are not yet up, it will wait.  But it should not
wait if the send is non-blocking.  In this case, it should just use the
base c_path for sending the message.
