HID: i2c-hid: Don't reset device upon system resume

Raydium touchscreen triggers interrupt storm after system-wide suspend:

	[ 179.085033] i2c_hid i2c-CUST0000:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (58/65535)

According to Raydium, Windows driver does not reset the device after system
resume.

The HID over I2C spec does specify a reset should be used at intialization, but
it doesn't specify if reset is required for system suspend.

Tested this patch on other i2c-hid touchpanels I have and those touchpanels do
work after S3 without doing reset. If any regression happens to other
touchpanel vendors, we can use quirk for Raydium devices.

There's still one device uses I2C_HID_QUIRK_RESEND_REPORT_DESCR so keep it
there.
