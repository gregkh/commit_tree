powerpc/powernv: Fix OPAL console driver OPAL_BUSY loops

The OPAL console driver does not delay in case it gets OPAL_BUSY or
OPAL_BUSY_EVENT from firmware.

It can't yet be made to sleep because it is called under spinlock,
but it can be changed to the standard OPAL_BUSY loop form, and a
delay added to keep it from hitting the firmware too frequently.
