coresight: tmc-etr: Do not clean trace buffer

We zero out the entire trace buffer used for ETR before it is enabled,
for helping with debugging. With the addition of scatter-gather mode,
the buffer could be bigger and non-contiguous.

Get rid of this step; if someone wants to debug, they can always add it
as and when needed.
