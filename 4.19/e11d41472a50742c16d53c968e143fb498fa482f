drm/amd/display: Use requested HDMI aspect ratio

[Why]
The DRM mode's HDMI picture aspect ratio field was never saved in
dc_stream's timing struct. This causes us to mistake a new stream to
have the same timings as the old, even though the user has requested a
different aspect ratio.

[How]
Save DRM's aspect ratio field within dc_stream's timing struct.
