x86/intel_rdt: Ensure requested schemata respects mode

When the administrator requests a change in a resource group's schemata
we have to ensure that the new schemata respects the current resource
group as well as the other active resource groups' schemata.

The new schemata is not allowed to overlap with the schemata of any
exclusive resource groups. Similarly, if the resource group being
changed is exclusive then its new schemata is not allowed to overlap
with any schemata of any other active resource group.
