crypto: ccree - allow bigger than sector XTS op

The ccree driver had a sanity check that we are not asked
to encrypt an XTS buffer bigger than a sane sector size
since XTS IV needs to include the sector number in the IV
so this is not expected in any real use case.

Unfortunately, this breaks cryptsetup benchmark test which
has a synthetic performance test using 64k buffer of data
with the same IV.

Remove the sanity check and allow the user to hang themselves
and/or run benchmarks if they so wish.
