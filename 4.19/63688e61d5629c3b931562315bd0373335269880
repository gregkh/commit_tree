staging: pi433: Comply with 80 character column limit

Lines have been split where it makes sense to shorten them in order
to comply with the coding standards and fix checkpatch.pl warnings.
There are still lines left that are too long, however breaking
those would impair readability.

Changes in v2:
 - now working on staging-next branch of the staging tree
 - the changes to the defines previously made are deleted
   due to readability
