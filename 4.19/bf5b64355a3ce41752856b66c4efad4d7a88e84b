rcutorture: Fix rcu_barrier successes counter

The rcutorture test module currently increments both successes and error
for the barrier test upon error, which results in misleading statistics
being printed.  This commit therefore changes the code to increment the
success counter only when the test actually passes.

This change was tested by by returning from the barrier callback without
incrementing the callback counter, thus introducing what appeared to
rcutorture to be rcu_barrier() failures.
