KVM: x86: Control guest reads of MSR_PLATFORM_INFO

Add KVM_CAP_MSR_PLATFORM_INFO so that userspace can disable guest access
to reads of MSR_PLATFORM_INFO.

Disabling access to reads of this MSR gives userspace the control to "expose"
this platform-dependent information to guests in a clear way. As it exists
today, guests that read this MSR would get unpopulated information if userspace
hadn't already set it (and prior to this patch series, only the CPUID faulting
information could have been populated). This existing interface could be
confusing if guests don't handle the potential for incorrect/incomplete
information gracefully (e.g. zero reported for base frequency).
