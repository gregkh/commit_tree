powerpc/traps: Use %lx format in show_signal_msg()

Use %lx format to print registers.  This avoids having two different
formats and avoids checking for MSR_64BIT, improving readability of the
function.

Even though we could have used %px, which is functionally equivalent to %lx
as per Documentation/core-api/printk-formats.rst, it is not semantically
correct because the data printed are not pointers.  And using %px requires
casting data to (void *).

Besides that, %lx matches the format used in show_regs().
