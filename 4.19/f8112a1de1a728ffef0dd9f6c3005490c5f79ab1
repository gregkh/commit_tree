leds: netdev trigger: simplifications from core changes

The trigger core learned error handling for the activate callback and
can handle device attributes now. This allows simplifying the driver
considerably. Note that .deactivate() is only called when .activate()
succeeded, so the check for trigger_data being non-NULL can go away.
(It was broken before because the core didn't clear .trigger_data, so it
might have been non-NULL even if .activate() failed before.)
