drm/i915: Wrap around the tail offset before setting ring->tail

The HW only accepts offsets within ring->size, and fails peculiarly if
the RING_HEAD or RING_TAIL is set to ring->size. Therefore whenever we
set ring->head/ring->tail we want to make sure it is within value (using
intel_ring_wrap()).

v2: Double check execlists as well
v3: Remove redundancy with assert_ring_tail_valid()
v4: Just assert in intel_ring_reset() rather than be over-defensive.
