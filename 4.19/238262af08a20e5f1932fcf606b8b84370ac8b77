pinctrl: mt7622: Fix probe fail by misuse the selector

After the commit acf137951367 ("pinctrl: core: Return selector to the
pinctrl driver") and the commit 47f1242d19c3 ("pinctrl: pinmux: Return
selector to the pinctrl driver"), it's necessary to add the fixes
needed for the pin controller drivers to use the appropriate returned
selector for a negative error number returned in case of the fail at
these functions. Otherwise, the driver would have a failed probe and
that causes boot message cannot correctly output and devices fail
to acquire their own pins.
