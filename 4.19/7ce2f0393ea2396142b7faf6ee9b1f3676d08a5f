x86/CPU/AMD: Move TOPOEXT reenablement before reading smp_num_siblings

The TOPOEXT reenablement is a workaround for broken BIOSen which didn't
enable the CPUID bit. amd_get_topology_early(), however, relies on
that bit being set so that it can read out the CPUID leaf and set
smp_num_siblings properly.

Move the reenablement up to early_init_amd(). While at it, simplify
amd_get_topology_early().
