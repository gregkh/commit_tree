partitions/aix: fix usage of uninitialized lv_info and lvname structures

The if-block that sets a successful return value in aix_partition()
uses 'lvip[].pps_per_lv' and 'n[].name' potentially uninitialized.

For example, if 'numlvs' is zero or alloc_lvn() fails, neither is
initialized, but are used anyway if alloc_pvd() succeeds after it.

So, make the alloc_pvd() call conditional on their initialization.

This has been hit when attaching an apparently corrupted/stressed
AIX LUN, misleading the kernel to pr_warn() invalid data and hang.
