ata: ahci: Support state with min power but Partial low power state

Currently when min_power policy is selected, the partial low power state
is not entered and link will try aggressively enter to only slumber state.
Add a new policy which still enable DEVSLP but also try to enter partial
low power state. This policy is presented as "min_power_with_partial".

For information the difference between partial and slumber
Partial – PHY logic is powered up, and in a reduced power state. The link
PM exit latency to active state maximum is 10 ns.
Slumber – PHY logic is powered up, and in a reduced power state. The link
PM exit latency to active state maximum is 10 ms.
Devslp – PHY logic is powered down. The link PM exit latency from this
state to active state maximum is 20 ms, unless otherwise specified by
DETO.
