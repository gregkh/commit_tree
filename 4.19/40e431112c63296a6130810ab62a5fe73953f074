media: cleanup fall-through comments

As Ian pointed out, adding a '-' to the fallthrough seems to meet
the regex requirements at level 3 of the warning, at least when
the comment fits into a single line.

So, replace by a single line the comments that were broken into
multiple lines just to make gcc -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 happy.
