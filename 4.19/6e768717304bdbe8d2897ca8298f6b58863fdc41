blk-mq: dequeue request one by one from sw queue if hctx is busy

It won't be efficient to dequeue request one by one from sw queue,
but we have to do that when queue is busy for better merge performance.

This patch takes the Exponential Weighted Moving Average(EWMA) to figure
out if queue is busy, then only dequeue request one by one from sw queue
when queue is busy.
