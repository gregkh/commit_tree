RDMA/cma: Initialize resource type in __rdma_create_id()

Currently rdma_cm_id's resource tracking fields such as owner task and
kern_name and other non resource tracking fields are initialized in
in single function __rdma_create_id().

Therefore, initialize rdma_cm_id's resource type also in same init
