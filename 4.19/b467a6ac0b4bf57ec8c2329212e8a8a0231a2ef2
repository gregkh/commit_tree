bcache: add code comments for bset.c

This patch tries to add code comments in bset.c, to make some
tricky code and designment to be more comprehensible. Most information
of this patch comes from the discussion between Kent and I, he
offers very informative details. If there is any mistake
of the idea behind the code, no doubt that's from me misrepresentation.
