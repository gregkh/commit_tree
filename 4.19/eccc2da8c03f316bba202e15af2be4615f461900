atomics/treewide: Make atomic_fetch_add_unless() optional

Several architectures these have a near-identical implementation based
on atomic_read() and atomic_cmpxchg() which we can instead define in
<linux/atomic.h>, so let's do so, using something close to the existing
x86 implementation with try_cmpxchg().

Where an architecture provides its own atomic_fetch_add_unless(), it
must define a preprocessor symbol for it. The instrumented atomics are
updated accordingly.

Note that arch/arc's existing atomic_fetch_add_unless() had redundant
barriers, as these are already present in its atomic_cmpxchg()
implementation.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
