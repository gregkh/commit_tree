of: add helper to lookup compatible child node

Add of_get_compatible_child() helper that can be used to lookup
compatible child nodes.

Several drivers currently use of_find_compatible_node() to lookup child
nodes while failing to notice that the of_find_ functions search the
entire tree depth-first (from a given start node) and therefore can
match unrelated nodes. The fact that these functions also drop a
reference to the node they start searching from (e.g. the parent node)
is typically also overlooked, something which can lead to use-after-free
bugs.
