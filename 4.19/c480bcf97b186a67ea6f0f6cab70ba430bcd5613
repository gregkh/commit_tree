block: make iolatency avg_lat exponentially decay

Currently, avg_lat is calculated by accumulating the mean of every
window in a long running cumulative average. As time goes on, the metric
becomes less and less useful due to the accumulated history.

This patch reuses the same calculation done in load averages to make the
avg_lat metric more lively. Unlike load averages, the avg only advances
when a window elapses (due to an io). Idle periods extend the most
recent window. Bucketing is used to limit the history of avg_lat by
binding it to the window size. So, the window range for 1/exp (decay
rate) is [1 min, 2.5 min) when windows elapse immediately.

The current sample window size is exposed in the debug info to enable
calculation of the window range.
