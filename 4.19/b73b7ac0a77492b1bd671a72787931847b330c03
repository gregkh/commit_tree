crypto: sha256_generic - add cra_priority

sha256-generic and sha224-generic had a cra_priority of 0, so it wasn't
possible to have a lower priority SHA-256 or SHA-224 implementation, as
is desired for sha256_mb which is only useful under certain workloads
and is otherwise extremely slow.  Change them to priority 100, which is
the priority used for many of the other generic algorithms.
