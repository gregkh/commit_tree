arm64 / ACPI: clean the additional checks before calling ghes_notify_sea()

In order to remove the additional check before calling the
ghes_notify_sea(), make stub definition when !CONFIG_ACPI_APEI_SEA.

After this cleanup, we can simply call the ghes_notify_sea() to let
APEI driver handle the SEA notification.
