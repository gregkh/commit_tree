timekeeping: Default boot time offset to local_clock()

read_persistent_wall_and_boot_offset() is called during boot to read
both the persistent clock and also return the offset between the boot time
and the value of persistent clock.

Change the default boot_offset from zero to local_clock() so architectures,
that do not have a dedicated boot_clock but have early sched_clock(), such
as SPARCv9, x86, and possibly more will benefit from this change by getting
a better and more consistent estimate of the boot time without need for an
arch specific implementation.
