drm/atmel-hlcdc: Stop using plane->fb

We want to get rid of plane->fb on atomic drivers. Stop looking at it.

Daniel pointed out that the drm_framebuffer_put() in the plane cleanup
indicates that the driver doesn't shut things down cleanly. To do
that we should be able to just call drm_atomic_helper_shutdown(). Not
really sure the current cleanup sequence is actually sane, but whatever.

v2: Replace the drm_framebuffer_put() with
    drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() (Daniel)
