s390/decompressor: correct EXCLUDE_FILE construct

The following linker construct is problematic with linkers of
binutils < 2.28:

EXCLUDE_FILE (*piggy.o) *(.rodata.*)

from 8f1732fc2a11dc of binutils:
"though the linker accepts this without complaint the
EXCLUDE_FILE part is silently ignored and has no effect."

Silent ignoring of EXCLUDE_FILE construct made .rodata.compressed be
part of .rodata, and in case of .rodata.compressed following some
unaligned data, input_len would also become unaligned.

from arch/s390/boot/compressed/vmlinux.map:
 .rodata.compressed
                0x0000000000012fea   0x4d57e7 arch/s390/boot/compressed/piggy.o
                0x0000000000012fea                input_len
                0x0000000000012fee                input_data

input_len is later used here:
arch/s390/boot/compressed/misc.c:113
	__decompress(input_data, input_len, NULL, NULL, output, 0, NULL, error);

asm generated by gcc looks like:
	.loc 3 113 0
egfrl	%r11,input_len

from what assembler generates invalid (the second operand must be aligned
on a doubleword boundary):
   0x00000000000129b4 <+148>:   c4 bc 00 00 03 1b       lgfrl   %r11,0x12fea
hence specification exception is recognized.

To avoid an issue use EXCLUDE_FILE construct which is recognized by
older linkers (since at least binutils-2_11)
	*(EXCLUDE_FILE (*piggy.o) .rodata.compressed)

Also ensure that .rodata.compressed is at least doubleword aligned.
