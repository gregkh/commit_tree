bcache: add separate workqueue for journal_write to avoid deadlock

After write SSD completed, bcache schedules journal_write work to
system_wq, which is a public workqueue in system, without WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
flag. system_wq is also a bound wq, and there may be no idle kworker on
current processor. Creating a new kworker may unfortunately need to
reclaim memory first, by shrinking cache and slab used by vfs, which
depends on bcache device. That's a deadlock.

This patch create a new workqueue for journal_write with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
flag. It's rescuer thread will work to avoid the deadlock.
