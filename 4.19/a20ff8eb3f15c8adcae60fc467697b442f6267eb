mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Pass C-TCAM region and entry to insert function

When A-TCAM will be used together with C-TCAM, the C-TCAM code will need
to call into the eRP core in order to get an eRP for an inserted entry.

The eRP core takes an A-TCAM region as one of its arguments, so pass the
C-TCAM region to the insertion function which will later allow us to
derive the A-TCAM region, given it contains the C-TCAM one.
