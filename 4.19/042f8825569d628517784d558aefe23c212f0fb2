nfp: bring back support for offloading shared blocks

Now that we have offload replay infrastructure added by
commit 326367427cc0 ("net: sched: call reoffload op on block callback reg")
and flows are guaranteed to be removed correctly, we can revert
commit 951a8ee6def3 ("nfp: reject binding to shared blocks").
