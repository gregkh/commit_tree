scsi: sd: don't crash the host on invalid commands

When sd_init_command() get's a command with a unknown req_op() it crashes the
system via BUG().

This makes debugging the actual reason for the broken request cmd_flags pretty
hard as the system is down before it's able to write out debugging data on the
serial console or the trace buffer.

Change the BUG() to a WARN_ON() and return BLKPREP_KILL to fail gracefully and
return an I/O error to the producer of the request.
