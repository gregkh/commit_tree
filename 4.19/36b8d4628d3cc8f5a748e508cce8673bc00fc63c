perf tools: Fix use of alternatives to find JDIR

When a build is run from something like a cron job, the user's $PATH is
rather minimal, of note, not including /usr/sbin in my own case. Because
of that, an automated rpm package build ultimately fails to find
libperf-jvmti.so, because somewhere within the build, this happens...

  /bin/sh: alternatives: command not found
  /bin/sh: alternatives: command not found
  Makefile.config:849: No openjdk development package found, please install
  JDK package, e.g. openjdk-8-jdk, java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

...and while the build continues, libperf-jvmti.so isn't built, and
things fall down when rpm tries to find all the %files specified. Exact
same system builds everything just fine when the job is launched from a
login shell instead of a cron job, since alternatives is in $PATH, so
openjdk is actually found.

The test required to get into this section of code actually specifies
the full path, as does a block just above it, so let's do that here too.
