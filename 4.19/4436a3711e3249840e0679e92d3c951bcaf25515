arm64: dts: marvell: armada-37xx: reserve memory for ATF

The PSCI area should be reserved in Linux for PSCI operations such as
suspend/resume.

Reserve 2MiB of memory which matches the area used by ATF (BL1, BL2,
BL3x, see [1] in ATF source code). This covers all PSCI code and data
area and is 2MiB aligned, which is required by Linux for huge pages
handling.

Please note that this is a default setup allowing to perform PSCI
operations with legacy bootloaders. Recent bootloaders should update the
region size/position accordingly.
