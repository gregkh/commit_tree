nfp: bpf: remember maps by ID

Record perf maps by map ID, not raw kernel pointer.  This helps
with debug messages, because printing pointers to logs is frowned
upon, and makes debug easier for the users, as map ID is something
they should be more familiar with.  Note that perf maps are offload
neutral, therefore IDs won't be orphaned.

While at it use a rate limited print helper for the error message.
