headers: separate linux/mod_devicetable.h from linux/platform_device.h

At over 4000 #includes, <linux/platform_device.h> is the 9th most
#included header file in the Linux kernel.  It does not need
<linux/mod_devicetable.h>, so drop that header and explicitly add
<linux/mod_devicetable.h> to source files that need it.

   4146 #include <linux/platform_device.h>

After this patch, there are 225 files that use <linux/mod_devicetable.h>,
for a reduction of around 3900 times that <linux/mod_devicetable.h>
does not have to be read & parsed.

    225 #include <linux/mod_devicetable.h>

This patch was build-tested on 20 different arch-es.

It also makes these drivers SubmitChecklist#1 compliant.
