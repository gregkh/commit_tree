random: remove preempt disabled region

No need to keep preemption disabled across the whole function.

mix_pool_bytes() uses a spin_lock() to protect the pool and there are
other places like write_pool() whhich invoke mix_pool_bytes() without
disabling preemption.
credit_entropy_bits() is invoked from other places like
add_hwgenerator_randomness() without disabling preemption.

Before commit 95b709b6be49 ("random: drop trickle mode") the function
used __this_cpu_inc_return() which would require disabled preemption.
The preempt_disable() section was added in commit 43d5d3018c37 ("[PATCH]
random driver preempt robustness", history tree).  It was claimed that
the code relied on "vt_ioctl() being called under BKL".
