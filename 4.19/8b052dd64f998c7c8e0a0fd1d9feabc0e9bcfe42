fsi: sbefifo: Convert to use the new chardev

This converts FSI sbefifo to use the new fsi-core controlled
chardev allocator and use a real cdev instead of a miscdev.

One side effect is to fix the object lifetime by removing
the use of devm_kzalloc() for something that contains kobjects,
and using proper reference counting.
