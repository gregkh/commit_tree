net: hns3: Fix MSIX allocation issue for VF

The msix number for vf is different, depends on the max vf number.
Futherly if the vf supports roce, the offset of msix is not fixed.
It's incorrect to fix the msix number to 33. This patch fixes it by
querying the msix number from firmware, and adjusting it with roce
support.
