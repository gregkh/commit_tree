btrfs: fix in-memory value of total_devices after seed device deletion

In case of deleting the seed device the %cur_devices (seed) and the
%fs_devices (parent) are different. Now, as the parent
fs_devices::total_devices also maintains the total number of devices
including the seed device, so decrement its in-memory value for the
successful seed delete. We are already updating its corresponding
on-disk btrfs_super_block::number_devices value.
