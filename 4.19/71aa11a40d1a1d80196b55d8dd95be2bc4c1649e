s390/css: start the subchannel evaluation earlier

The css bus code uses 2 initcalls: channel_subsystem_init to
initialize internal data and channel_subsystem_init_sync to
start scanning for devices and wait for it to finish.

The start scanning for devices part is moved to the first
initcall such that more work happens in parallel.
