ovl: Provide a mount option metacopy=on/off for metadata copyup

By default metadata only copy up is disabled.  Provide a mount option so
that users can choose one way or other.

Also provide a kernel config and module option to enable/disable metacopy
feature.

metacopy feature requires redirect_dir=on when upper is present.
Otherwise, it requires redirect_dir=follow atleast.

As of now, metacopy does not work with nfs_export=on.  So if both
metacopy=on and nfs_export=on then nfs_export is disabled.
