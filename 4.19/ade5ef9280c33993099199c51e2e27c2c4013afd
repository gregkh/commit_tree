atomics: Make conditional ops return 'bool'

Some of the atomics return a status value, which is a boolean value
describing whether the operation was performed. To make it clear that
this is a boolean value, let's update the common fallbacks to return
bool, fixing up the return values and comments likewise.

At the same time, let's simplify the description of the operations in
their respective comments.

The instrumented atomics and generic atomic64 implementation are updated
accordingly.

Note that atomic64_dec_if_positive() doesn't follow the usual test op
pattern, and returns the would-be decremented value. This is not
changed.
