KVM: vmx: hyper-v: don't pass EPT configuration info to vmx_hv_remote_flush_tlb()

I'm observing random crashes in multi-vCPU L2 guests running on KVM on
Hyper-V. I bisected the issue to the commit 877ad952be3d ("KVM: vmx: Add
tlb_remote_flush callback support"). Hyper-V TLFS states:

"AddressSpace specifies an address space ID (an EPT PML4 table pointer)"

So apparently, Hyper-V doesn't expect us to pass naked EPTP, only PML4
pointer should be used. Strip off EPT configuration information before
calling into vmx_hv_remote_flush_tlb().

Fixes: 877ad952be3d ("KVM: vmx: Add tlb_remote_flush callback support")
