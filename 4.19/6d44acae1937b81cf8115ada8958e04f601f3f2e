powerpc64s: Show ori31 availability in spectre_v1 sysfs file not v2

When I added the spectre_v2 information in sysfs, I included the
availability of the ori31 speculation barrier.

Although the ori31 barrier can be used to mitigate v2, it's primarily
intended as a spectre v1 mitigation. Spectre v2 is mitigated by
hardware changes.

So rework the sysfs files to show the ori31 information in the
spectre_v1 file, rather than v2.

Currently we display eg:

  $ grep . spectre_v*
  spectre_v1:Mitigation: __user pointer sanitization
  spectre_v2:Mitigation: Indirect branch cache disabled, ori31 speculation barrier enabled

After:

  $ grep . spectre_v*
  spectre_v1:Mitigation: __user pointer sanitization, ori31 speculation barrier enabled
  spectre_v2:Mitigation: Indirect branch cache disabled
