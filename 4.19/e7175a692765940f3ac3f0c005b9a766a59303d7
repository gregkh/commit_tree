btrfs: remove the wait ordered logic in the log_one_extent path

Since we are waiting on all ordered extents at the start of the fsync()
path we don't need to wait on any logged ordered extents, and we don't
need to look up the checksums on the ordered extents as they will
already be on disk prior to getting here.  Rework this so we're only
looking up and copying the on-disk checksums for the extent range we
care about.
