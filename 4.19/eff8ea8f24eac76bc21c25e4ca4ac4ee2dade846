net/mlx5: FW tracer, add hardware structures

This change adds the infrastructure to mlx5 core fw tracer.
It introduces the following 4 new registers:
MLX5_REG_MTRC_CAP  - Used to read tracer capabilities
MLX5_REG_MTRC_CONF - Used to set tracer configurations
MLX5_REG_MTRC_STDB - Used to query tracer strings database
MLX5_REG_MTRC_CTRL - Used to control the tracer

The capability of the tracing can be checked using mcam access
register, therefore, the mcam access register interface will expose
the tracer register.
