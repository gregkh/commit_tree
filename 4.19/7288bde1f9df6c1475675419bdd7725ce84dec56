x86: kvm: avoid unused variable warning

Removing one of the two accesses of the maxphyaddr variable led to
a harmless warning:

arch/x86/kvm/x86.c: In function 'kvm_set_mmio_spte_mask':
arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:6563:6: error: unused variable 'maxphyaddr' [-Werror=unused-variable]

Removing the #ifdef seems to be the nicest workaround, as it
makes the code look cleaner than adding another #ifdef.
