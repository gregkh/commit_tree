signal: Pass pid and pid type into send_sigqueue

Make the code more maintainable by performing more of the signal
related work in send_sigqueue.

A quick inspection of do_timer_create will show that this code path
does not lookup a thread group by a thread's pid.  Making it safe
to find the task pointed to by it_pid with "pid_task(it_pid, type)";

This supports the changes needed in fork to tell if a signal was sent
to a single process or a group of processes.

Having the pid to task transition in signal.c will also make it easier
to sort out races with de_thread and and the thread group leader
exiting when it comes time to address that.
