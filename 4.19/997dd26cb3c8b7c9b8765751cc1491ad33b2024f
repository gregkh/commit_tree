powerpc/traps: Avoid rate limit messages from show unhandled signals

In the recent commit to add an explicit ratelimit state when showing
unhandled signals, commit 35a52a10c3ac ("powerpc/traps: Use an
explicit ratelimit state for show_signal_msg()"), I put the check of
show_unhandled_signals and the ratelimit state before the call to
unhandled_signal() so as to avoid unnecessarily calling the latter
when show_unhandled_signals is false.

However that causes us to check the ratelimit state on every call, so
if we take a lot of *handled* signals that has the effect of making
the ratelimit code print warnings that callbacks have been suppressed
when they haven't.

So rearrange the code so that we check show_unhandled_signals first,
then call unhandled_signal() and finally check the ratelimit state.
