staging: rtlwifi: Fix a possible sleep-in-atomic-context bug in _is_fw_read_cmd_down()

The driver may sleep with holding a spinlock.
The function call path (from bottom to top) in Linux-4.16.7 is:

[FUNC] schedule
drivers/staging/rtlwifi/halmac/rtl_halmac.c, 884:
		schedule in _is_fw_read_cmd_down
drivers/staging/rtlwifi/halmac/rtl_halmac.c, 912:
		_is_fw_read_cmd_down in rtl_halmac_send_h2c
drivers/staging/rtlwifi/halmac/rtl_halmac.c, 907:
		_raw_spin_lock_irqsave in rtl_halmac_send_h2c

To fix this bug, schedule() is replaced with mdelay(1).

This bug is found by my static analysis tool (DSAC-2) and checked by
my code review.
