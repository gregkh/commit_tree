brcmfmac: fix brcmf_wiphy_wowl_params() NULL pointer dereference

The kernel BUG happens when wowl is enabled from firmware. In
brcmf_wiphy_wowl_params(), cfg is a NULL pointer because it is
drvr->config returned from wiphy_to_cfg(), and drvr->config is not set
yet. To fix it, set drvr->config before brcmf_setup_wiphy() which
calls brcmf_wiphy_wowl_params().
