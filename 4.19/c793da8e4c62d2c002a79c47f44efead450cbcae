x86/intel_rdt: Global closid helper to support future fixes

The number of CLOSIDs supported by a system is the minimum number of
CLOSIDs supported by any of its resources. Care should be taken when
iterating over the CLOSIDs of a resource since it may be that the number
of CLOSIDs supported on the system is less than the number of CLOSIDs
supported by the resource.

Introduce a helper function that can be used to query the number of
CLOSIDs that is supported by all resources, irrespective of how many
CLOSIDs are supported by a particular resource.
