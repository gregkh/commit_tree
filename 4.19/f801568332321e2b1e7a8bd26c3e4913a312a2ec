smb3: check for and properly advertise directory lease support

Although servers will typically ignore unsupported features,
we should advertise the support for directory leases (as
Windows e.g. does) in the negotiate protocol capabilities we
pass to the server, and should check for the server capability
(CAP_DIRECTORY_LEASING) before sending a lease request for an
open of a directory.  This will prevent us from accidentally
sending directory leases to SMB2.1 or SMB2 server for example.
