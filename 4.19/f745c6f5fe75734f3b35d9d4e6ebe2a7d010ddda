fs, mm: account buffer_head to kmemcg

The buffer_head can consume a significant amount of system memory and is
directly related to the amount of page cache.  In our production
environment we have observed that a lot of machines are spending a
significant amount of memory as buffer_head and can not be left as
system memory overhead.

Charging buffer_head is not as simple as adding __GFP_ACCOUNT to the
allocation.  The buffer_heads can be allocated in a memcg different from
the memcg of the page for which buffer_heads are being allocated.  One
concrete example is memory reclaim.  The reclaim can trigger I/O of
pages of any memcg on the system.  So, the right way to charge
buffer_head is to extract the memcg from the page for which buffer_heads
are being allocated and then use targeted memcg charging API.
