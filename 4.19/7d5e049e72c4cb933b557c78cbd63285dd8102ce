iomap: fix WARN_ON_ONCE on uninitialized variable

In commit 9dc55f1389f9569 ("iomap: add support for sub-pagesize buffered
I/O without buffer heads") we moved the initialization of poff (it's
computed from pos) into a separate helper function.  Inline data only
ever deals with pos == 0, hence the WARN_ON_ONCE, but now we're testing
an uninitialized variable.

Therefore, change the test to check the parameter directly.
