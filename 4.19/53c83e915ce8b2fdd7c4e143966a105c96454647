crypto: inside-secure - add an invalidation flag

Add a flags field in the private structure, and a first flag for engines
needing context invalidation (currently only the eip197b). The
invalidation is needed when the engine includes a TRC cache, which will
also be true for the upcoming addition of the eip197d engine.
