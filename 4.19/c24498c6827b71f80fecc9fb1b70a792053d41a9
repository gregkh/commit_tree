netpoll: do not test NAPI_STATE_SCHED in poll_one_napi()

Since we do no longer require NAPI drivers to provide
an ndo_poll_controller(), napi_schedule() has not been done
before poll_one_napi() invocation.

So testing NAPI_STATE_SCHED is likely to cause early returns.

While we are at it, remove outdated comment.

Note to future bisections : This change might surface prior
bugs in drivers. See commit 73f21c653f93 ("bnxt_en: Fix TX
timeout during netpoll.") for one occurrence.
