ASoC: dapm: Fix NULL pointer deference on CODEC to CODEC DAIs

Commit a655de808cbde ("ASoC: core: Allow topology to override
machine driver FE DAI link config.") caused soc_dai_hw_params to
be come dependent on the substream private_data being set with
a pointer to the snd_soc_pcm_runtime. Currently, CODEC to CODEC
links don't set this, which causes a NULL pointer dereference:

[<4069de54>] (soc_dai_hw_params) from
[<40694b68>] (snd_soc_dai_link_event+0x1a0/0x380)

Since the ASoC core in general assumes that the substream
private_data will be set to a pointer to the snd_soc_pcm_runtime,
update the CODEC to CODEC links to respect this.
