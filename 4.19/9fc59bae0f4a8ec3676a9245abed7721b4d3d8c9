drm/i915/icl: Fix MG PLL setup when refclk is 38.4MHz

Atm we're zeroing out fields in MG_PLL_BIAS and MG_PLL_TDC_COLDST_BIAS
if refclk is 38.4MHz, whereas the spec tells us to preserve them.
Although the calculated values mostly match the register defaults even
for the 38.4MHz case, there are some differences wrt. what BIOS
programs (I noticed at least differences in the MG_PLL_BIAS/IREFTRIM and
MG_PLL_BIAS/BIASCAL_EN fields). In the lack of further info on how to
program these fields, just do what the spec says and preserve the BIOS
state.

v2:
- Preserve the BIOS programmed reg fields instead of programming them.
