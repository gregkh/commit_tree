s390/qeth: speed-up L3 IQD xmit

This implements a new xmit path for L3 HiperSockets, which carves the
HW header from skb headroom instead of allocating it from the hdr cache.
It also adds NETIF_F_SG support.

The delta in qeth_l3_xmit() is all just removal of IQD-specific code and
some minor consolidation.
