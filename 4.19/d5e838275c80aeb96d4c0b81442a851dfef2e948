devres: Add devm_of_iomap()

There are still quite a few cases where a device might want
to get to a different node of the device-tree, obtain the
resources and map them.

We have of_iomap() and of_io_request_and_map() but they both
have shortcomings, such as not returning the size of the
resource found (which can be useful) and not being "managed".

This adds a devm_of_iomap() that provides all of these and
should probably replace uses of the above in most drivers.
