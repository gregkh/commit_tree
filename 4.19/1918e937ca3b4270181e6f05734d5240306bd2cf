ixgbe: Refactor queue disable logic to take completion time into account

This change is meant to allow us to take completion time into account when
disabling queues. Previously we were just working with hard coded values
for how long we should wait. This worked fine for the standard case where
completion timeout was operating in the 50us to 50ms range, however on
platforms that have higher completion timeout times this was resulting in
Rx queues disable messages being displayed as we weren't waiting long
enough for outstanding Rx DMA completions.
