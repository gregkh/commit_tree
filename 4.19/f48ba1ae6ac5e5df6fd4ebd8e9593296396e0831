ARM: tegra: Remove usage of deprecated skeleton.dtsi

Remove the usage of skeleton.dtsi because it was deprecated since commit
9c0da3cc61f1 ("ARM: dts: explicitly mark skeleton.dtsi as deprecated").
It also allows later to fix DTC warnings for missing unit name in
/memory nodes.

Compiled DTBs are the same as before this commit.
