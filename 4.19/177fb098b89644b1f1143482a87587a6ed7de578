media: vsp1: Provide VSP1 feature helper macro

The VSP1 devices define their specific capabilities through features
marked in their device info structure. Various parts of the code read
this info structure to infer if the features are available.

Wrap this into a more readable vsp1_feature(vsp1, f) macro to ensure
that usage is consistent throughout the driver.
