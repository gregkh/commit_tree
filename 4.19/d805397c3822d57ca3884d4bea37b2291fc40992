sctp: use the pmtu from the icmp packet to update transport pathmtu

Other than asoc pmtu sync from all transports, sctp_assoc_sync_pmtu
is also processing transport pmtu_pending by icmp packets. But it's
meaningless to use sctp_dst_mtu(t->dst) as new pmtu for a transport.

The right pmtu value should come from the icmp packet, and it would
be saved into transport->mtu_info in this patch and used later when
the pmtu sync happens in sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc or sctp_packet_config.

Besides, without this patch, as pmtu can only be updated correctly
when receiving a icmp packet and no place is holding sock lock, it
will take long time if the sock is busy with sending packets.

Note that it doesn't process transport->mtu_info in .release_cb(),
as there is no enough information for pmtu update, like for which
asoc or transport. It is not worth traversing all asocs to check
pmtu_pending. So unlike tcp, sctp does this in tx path, for which
mtu_info needs to be atomic_t.
