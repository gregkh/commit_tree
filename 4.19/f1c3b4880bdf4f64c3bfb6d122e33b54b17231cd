staging:rtl8192u: Remove typedef and rename QOS_TCLAS - Style

Remove the typedef from the union QOS_TCLAS, which causes a checkpatch
issue with defining new types. In addition, as a type, the name should
be in lowercase so has been changed.

These are coding style changes and should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
