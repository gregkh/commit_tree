memory: ti-emif-sram: Add resume function to recopy sram code

After an RTC+DDR cycle we lose sram context so emif pm functions present
in sram are lost. We can check if the first byte of the original
code in DDR contains the same first byte as the code in sram, and if
they do not match we know we have lost context and must recopy the
functions to the previous address to maintain PM functionality.
