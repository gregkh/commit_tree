lightnvm: limit get chunk meta request size

For devices that does not specify a limit on its transfer size, the
get_chk_meta command may send down a single I/O retrieving the full
chunk metadata table. Resulting in large 2-4MB I/O requests. Instead,
split up the I/Os to a maximum of 256KB and issue them separately to
reduce memory requirements.
