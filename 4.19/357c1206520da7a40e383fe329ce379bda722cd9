mpage: add argument structure for do_mpage_readpage()

Patch series "Submit ->readpages() IO as read-ahead", v4.

The only caller of ->readpages() is from read-ahead, yet we don't submit
IO flagged with REQ_RAHEAD.  This means we don't see it in blktrace, for
instance, which is a shame.  Additionally, it's preventing further
functional changes in the block layer for deadling with read-ahead more
intelligently.  We already make assumptions about ->readpages() just
being for read-ahead in the mpage implementation, using
readahead_gfp_mask(mapping) as out GFP mask of choice.

This small series fixes up mpage_readpages() to submit with REQ_RAHEAD,
which takes care of file systems using mpage_readpages().  The first
patch is a prep patch, that makes do_mpage_readpage() take an argument
structure.

This patch (of 4):

We're currently passing 8 arguments to this function, clean it up a bit
by packing the arguments in an args structure we pass to it.

No intentional functional changes in this patch.
