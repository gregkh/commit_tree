ftrace: Remove unused pointer ftrace_swapper_pid

Pointer ftrace_swapper_pid is defined but is never used hence it is
redundant and can be removed. The use of this variable was removed
in commit 345ddcc882d8 ("ftrace: Have set_ftrace_pid use the bitmap
like events do").

Cleans up clang warning:
warning: 'ftrace_swapper_pid' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
