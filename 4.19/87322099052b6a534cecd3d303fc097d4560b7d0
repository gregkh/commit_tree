KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Signal IRQs using their configured group

Now when we have a group configuration on the struct IRQ, use this state
when populating the LR and signaling interrupts as either group 0 or
group 1 to the VM.  Depending on the model of the emulated GIC, and the
guest's configuration of the VMCR, interrupts may be signaled as IRQs or
FIQs to the VM.
