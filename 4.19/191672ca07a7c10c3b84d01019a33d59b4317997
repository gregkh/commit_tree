net_sched: fix unused variable warning in stmmac

The new tcf_exts_for_each_action() macro doesn't reference its
arguments when CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT is disabled, which leads to
a harmless warning in at least one driver:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_tc.c: In function 'tc_fill_actions':
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_tc.c:64:6: error: unused variable 'i' [-Werror=unused-variable]

Adding a cast to void lets us avoid this kind of warning.
To be on the safe side, do it for all three arguments, not
just the one that caused the warning.
