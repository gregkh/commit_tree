x86/intel_rdt: Fix unchecked MSR access

When a new resource group is created, it is initialized with sane
defaults that currently assume the resource being initialized is a CAT
resource. This code path is also followed by a MBA resource that is not
allocated the same as a CAT resource and as a result we encounter the
following unchecked MSR access error:

unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0xd51 (tried to write 0x0000
000000000064) at rIP: 0xffffffffae059994 (native_write_msr+0x4/0x20)
Call Trace:
mba_wrmsr+0x41/0x80
update_domains+0x125/0x130
rdtgroup_mkdir+0x270/0x500

Fix the above by ensuring the initial allocation is only attempted on a
CAT resource.
