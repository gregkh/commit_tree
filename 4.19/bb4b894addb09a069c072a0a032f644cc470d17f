ASoC: core: add support to card re-bind using component framework

This patch aims at achieving dynamic behaviour of audio card when
the dependent components disappear and reappear.

With this patch the card is removed if any of the dependent component
is removed and card is added back if the dependent component comes back.
All this is done using component framework and matching based on
component name.
