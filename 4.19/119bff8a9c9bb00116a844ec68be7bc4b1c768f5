x86/CPU/AMD: Do not check CPUID max ext level before parsing SMP info

Old code used to check whether CPUID ext max level is >= 0x80000008 because
that last leaf contains the number of cores of the physical CPU.  The three
functions called there now do not depend on that leaf anymore so the check
can go.
