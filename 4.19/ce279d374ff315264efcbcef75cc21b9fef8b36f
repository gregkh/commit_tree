efi/libstub: Only disable stackleak plugin for arm64

arm64 uses the full KBUILD_CFLAGS for building libstub as opposed
to x86 which doesn't. This means that x86 doesn't pick up
the gcc-plugins. We need to disable the stackleak plugin but
doing this unconditionally breaks x86 build since it doesn't
have any plugins. Switch to disabling the stackleak plugin for
arm64 only.
