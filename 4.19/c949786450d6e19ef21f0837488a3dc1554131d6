s390: correct _stext offset

Avoid unnecessary rewrite of psw and merge _stext into
startup_continue. This allows to move _stext definition to vmlinux.lds.S,
where _etext is also defined and set _stext to the actual beginning of
.text at 0x100000.

This fixes the problem with setting the last .text page as
not-executable due to vmem_map_init relying on page alinged _stext and
_etext.
