tls: Skip zerocopy path for ITER_KVEC

The zerocopy path ultimately calls iov_iter_get_pages, which defines the
step function for ITER_KVECs as simply, return -EFAULT. Taking the
non-zerocopy path for ITER_KVECs avoids the unnecessary fallback.

See https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150401023311.GL29656@ZenIV.linux.org.uk/T/#u
for a discussion of why zerocopy for vmalloc data is not a good idea.

Discovered while testing NBD traffic encrypted with ktls.
