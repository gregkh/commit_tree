drm/msm/gpu: Capture the GPU state on a GPU hang

Capture the GPU state on a GPU hang and store it for later playback
via the devcoredump facility. Only one crash state is stored at a
time on the assumption that the first hang is usually the most
interesting. The existing crash state can be cleared after capturing
it and then a new one will be captured on the next hang.
