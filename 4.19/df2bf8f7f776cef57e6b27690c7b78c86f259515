rcu: Use better variable names in funnel locking loop

The funnel locking loop in rcu_start_this_gp uses rcu_root as a
temporary variable while walking the combining tree. This causes a
tiresome exercise of a code reader reminding themselves that rcu_root
may not be root. Lets just call it rnp, and rename other variables as
well to be more appropriate.
