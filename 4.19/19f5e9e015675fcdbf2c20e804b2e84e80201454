mmc: atmel-mci: fix bad logic of sg_copy_{from,to}_buffer conversion

The conversion to sg_copy_{from,to}_buffer has been done in the wrong
way. sg_copy_to_buffer is a copy from an SG list to a linear buffer so
it can't replace memcpy(buf + offset, &value, remaining) where buf is
the virtual address of the SG. Same for sg_copy_to_buffer but in the
opposite way.
