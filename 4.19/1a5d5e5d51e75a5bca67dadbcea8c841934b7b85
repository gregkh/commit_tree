ext4: fix spectre gadget in ext4_mb_regular_allocator()

'ac->ac_g_ex.fe_len' is a user-controlled value which is used in the
derivation of 'ac->ac_2order'. 'ac->ac_2order', in turn, is used to
index arrays which makes it a potential spectre gadget. Fix this by
sanitizing the value assigned to 'ac->ac2_order'.  This covers the
following accesses found with the help of smatch:

* fs/ext4/mballoc.c:1896 ext4_mb_simple_scan_group() warn: potential
  spectre issue 'grp->bb_counters' [w] (local cap)

* fs/ext4/mballoc.c:445 mb_find_buddy() warn: potential spectre issue
  'EXT4_SB(e4b->bd_sb)->s_mb_offsets' [r] (local cap)

* fs/ext4/mballoc.c:446 mb_find_buddy() warn: potential spectre issue
  'EXT4_SB(e4b->bd_sb)->s_mb_maxs' [r] (local cap)
