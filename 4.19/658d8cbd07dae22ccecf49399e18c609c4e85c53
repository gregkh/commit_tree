drm/vc4: Fix the "no scaling" case on multi-planar YUV formats

When there's no scaling requested ->is_unity should be true no matter
the format.

Also, when no scaling is requested and we have a multi-planar YUV
format, we should leave ->y_scaling[0] to VC4_SCALING_NONE and only
set ->x_scaling[0] to VC4_SCALING_PPF.

Doing this fixes an hardly visible artifact (seen when using modetest
and a rather big overlay plane in YUV420).
