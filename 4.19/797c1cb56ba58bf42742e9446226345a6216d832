f2fs: restrict setting up inode.i_advise

In order to give advise to f2fs to recognize hot/cold file, it is possible
that we can set specific bit in inode.i_advise through setxattr(), but
there are several bits which are used internally, such as encrypt_bit,
keep_size_bit, they should never be changed through setxattr().

So that this patch 1) adds FADVISE_MODIFIABLE_BITS to filter modifiable
bits user given, 2) supports to clear {hot,cold}_file bits.
