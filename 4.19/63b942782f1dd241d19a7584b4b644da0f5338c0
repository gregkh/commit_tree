crypto: inside-secure - set tx_max_cmd_queue to 32

The ORO bridge (connected to the EIP197 write channel) does not
generate back pressure towards the EIP197 when its internal FIFO is
full. It assumes that the EIP will not drive more write transactions
than the maximal supported outstanding (32).

Hence tx_max_cmd_queue must be configured to 5 (or less).
