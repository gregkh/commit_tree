arm64: consistently use unsigned long for thread flags

In do_notify_resume, we manipulate thread_flags as a 32-bit unsigned
int, whereas thread_info::flags is a 64-bit unsigned long, and elsewhere
(e.g. in the entry assembly) we manipulate the flags as a 64-bit
quantity.

For consistency, and to avoid problems if we end up with more than 32
flags, let's make do_notify_resume take the flags as a 64-bit unsigned
long.
