net: create reusable function for getting ownership info of sysfs inodes

Make net_ns_get_ownership() reusable by networking code outside of core.
This is useful, for example, to allow bridge related sysfs files to be
owned by container root.

Add a function comment since this is a potentially dangerous function to
use given the way that kobject_get_ownership() works by initializing uid
and gid before calling .get_ownership().
