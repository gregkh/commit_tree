staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page-1 Bit Masks - Style

Remove the unused 'page-1' Bit Masks. These definitions fail the
checkpatch CamelCase naming test. To avoid renaming the definitions
have simply been removed. This is a coding style change which should
have no impact on runtime code execution.
