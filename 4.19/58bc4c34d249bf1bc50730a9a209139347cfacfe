mm/vmstat.c: skip NR_TLB_REMOTE_FLUSH* properly

5dd0b16cdaff ("mm/vmstat: Make NR_TLB_REMOTE_FLUSH_RECEIVED available even
on UP") made the availability of the NR_TLB_REMOTE_FLUSH* counters inside
the kernel unconditional to reduce #ifdef soup, but (either to avoid
showing dummy zero counters to userspace, or because that code was missed)
didn't update the vmstat_array, meaning that all following counters would
be shown with incorrect values.

This only affects kernel builds with
CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS=y && CONFIG_DEBUG_TLBFLUSH=y && CONFIG_SMP=n.
