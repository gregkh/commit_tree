drm/i915/psr: Enable CRC check in the static frame on the sink side

Sink can be configured to calculate the CRC over the static frame and
compare with the CRC calculated and transmited in the VSC SDP by
source, if there is a mismatch sink will do a short pulse in HPD
and set DP_PSR_LINK_CRC_ERROR in DP_PSR_ERROR_STATUS.

Spec: 7723

v6:
andling DP_PSR_LINK_CRC_ERROR here and remove "bdw+" from commit
message

v4:
patch moved to after 'drm/i915/psr: Avoid PSR exit max time timeout'
to avoid touch in 2 patches EDP_PSR_DEBUG.

v3:
disabling PSR instead of exiting on error
