autofs: fix clearing AUTOFS_EXP_LEAVES in autofs_expire_indirect()

The expire flag AUTOFS_EXP_LEAVES is cleared before the second call to
should_expire() in autofs_expire_indirect() but the parameter passed in
the second call is incorrect.

Fortunately AUTOFS_EXP_LEAVES expire flag has not been used for a long
time but might be needed in the future so fix it rather than remove the
expire leaves functionality.
