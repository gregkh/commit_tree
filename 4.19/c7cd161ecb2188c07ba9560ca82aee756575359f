rcu: Assign higher prio to RCU threads if rcutorture is built-in

The rcutorture RCU priority boosting tests fail even with CONFIG_RCU_BOOST
set because rcutorture's threads run at the same priority as the default
RCU kthreads (RT class with priority of 1).

This patch checks if RCU torture is built into the kernel and if so,
assigns RT priority 1 to the RCU threads, allowing the rcutorture boost
tests to pass.
