drm/amd/display: Retry link training again

[Why]
Some receivers seem to fail the first link training but are good on
subsequent tries. We want to retry link training again. This fixes
HTC vive pro not lighting up after being disabled.

[How]
Check if the link training passed without fall back if this is not
the case then we retry link training.
