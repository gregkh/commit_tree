ACPI / scan: Create platform device for fwnodes with multiple i2c devices

Some devices have multiple I2cSerialBus resources and for things to work
an i2c-client must be instantiated for each, each with its own
i2c_device_id.

Normally we only instantiate an i2c-client for the first resource, using
the ACPI HID as id.

This commit adds a list of HIDs of devices, which need multiple i2c-clients
instantiated from a single fwnode, to acpi_device_enumeration_by_parent and
makes acpi_device_enumeration_by_parent return false for these devices so
that a platform device will be instantiated.

This allows the drivers/platform/x86/i2c-multi-instantiate.c driver, which
knows which i2c_device_id to use for each resource, to bind to the fwnode
and initiate an i2c-client for each resource.
