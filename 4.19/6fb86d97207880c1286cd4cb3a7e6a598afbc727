cpu/hotplug: Remove skip_onerr field from cpuhp_step structure

When notifiers were there, `skip_onerr` was used to avoid calling
particular step startup/teardown callbacks in the CPU up/down rollback
path, which made the hotplug asymmetric.

As notifiers are gone now after the full state machine conversion, the
`skip_onerr` field is no longer required.

Remove it from the structure and its usage.
