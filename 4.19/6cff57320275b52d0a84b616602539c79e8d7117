ubifs: tnc: use monotonic znode timestamp

The tnc uses get_seconds() based timestamps to check the age of a znode,
which has two problems: on 32-bit architectures this may overflow in
2038 or 2106, and it gives incorrect information when the system time
is updated using settimeofday().

Using montonic timestamps with ktime_get_seconds() solves both thes
problems.
