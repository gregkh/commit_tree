drm/v3d: Remove the bad signaled() implementation.

Since our seqno value comes from a counter associated with the GPU
ring, not the entity (aka client), they'll be completed out of order.
There's actually no need for this code at all, since we don't have
enable_signaling() and thus DMA_FENCE_SIGNALED_BIT will be set before
we could be called.
