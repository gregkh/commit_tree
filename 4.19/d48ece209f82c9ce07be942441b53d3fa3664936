blk-mq: init hctx sched after update ctx and hctx mapping

Currently, when update nr_hw_queues, IO scheduler's init_hctx will
be invoked before the mapping between ctx and hctx is adapted
correctly by blk_mq_map_swqueue. The IO scheduler init_hctx (kyber)
may depend on this mapping and get wrong result and panic finally.
A simply way to fix this is that switch the IO scheduler to 'none'
before update the nr_hw_queues, and then switch it back after
update nr_hw_queues. blk_mq_sched_init_/exit_hctx are removed due
to nobody use them any more.
