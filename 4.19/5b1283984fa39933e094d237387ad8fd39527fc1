thermal: tsens: Add support to split up register address space into two

There are two banks of registers for v2 TSENS IPs: SROT and TM. On older
SoCs these were contiguous, leading to DTs mapping them as one register
address space of size 0x2000. In newer SoCs, these two banks are not
contiguous anymore.

Add logic to init_common() to differentiate between old and new DTs and
adjust associated offsets for the TM register bank so that the old DTs will
continue to function correctly.
