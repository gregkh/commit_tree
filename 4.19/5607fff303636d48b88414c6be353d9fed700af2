bpf: sockmap only allow ESTABLISHED sock state

After this patch we only allow socks that are in ESTABLISHED state or
are being added via a sock_ops event that is transitioning into an
ESTABLISHED state. By allowing sock_ops events we allow users to
manage sockmaps directly from sock ops programs. The two supported
sock_ops ops are BPF_SOCK_OPS_PASSIVE_ESTABLISHED_CB and
BPF_SOCK_OPS_ACTIVE_ESTABLISHED_CB.

Similar to TLS ULP this ensures sk_user_data is correct.
