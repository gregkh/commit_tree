s390 cio: Rewrite trace point in s390_cio_interrupt

Tools like 'perf stat' parse the trace point format files defined
in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/s390/.../format to handle
the print fmt: statement. The kernel provides a library in
directory linux/tools/lib/traceevent/* for this reason.

This library can not handle structures or unions defined in
the TRACE_EVENT/TP_STRUCT__entry macros with __field_struct macro.
There is no possibility to extract a structure member
(which might be a bit field) since there is no packing
information nor bit field offset by parsing the printf fmt line.

Therefore rewrite the TRACE_EVENT macro and add the
__field macro for the necessary fields.
Keep the __fieldstruct macro to extract the complete
structure when dumps are analysed.

Note that the same information is displayed, this is no
interface change.
