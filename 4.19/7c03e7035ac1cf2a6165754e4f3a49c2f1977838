selftests/x86: Add clock_gettime() tests to test_vdso

Now that the vDSO implementation of clock_gettime() is getting
reworked, add a selftest for it.  This tests that its output is
consistent with the syscall version.

This is marked for stable to serve as a test for commit

  715bd9d12f84 ("x86/vdso: Fix asm constraints on vDSO syscall fallbacks")
