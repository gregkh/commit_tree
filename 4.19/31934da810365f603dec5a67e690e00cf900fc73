net/9p/virtio: Fix hard lockup in req_done

When client has multiple threads that issue io requests
all the time, and the server has a very good performance,
it may cause cpu is running in the irq context for a long
time because it can check virtqueue has buf in the *while*
loop.

So we should keep chan->lock in the whole loop.
