fpga: mgr: add status for fpga-manager

This patch adds status sysfs interface for fpga manager, it's a
read only interface which allows user to get fpga manager status,
including full/partial reconfiguration error and other status
information. It adds a status callback to fpga_manager_ops too,
allows each fpga_manager driver to define its own method to
collect latest status from hardware.

The following sysfs file is created:
* /sys/class/fpga_manager/<fpga>/status
  Return status of fpga manager, including reconfiguration errors.
