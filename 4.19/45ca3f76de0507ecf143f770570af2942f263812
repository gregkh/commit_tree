firmware: vpd: Fix section enabled flag on vpd_section_destroy

static struct ro_vpd and rw_vpd are initialized by vpd_sections_init()
in vpd_probe() based on header's ro and rw sizes.
In vpd_remove() vpd_section_destroy() performs deinitialization based
on enabled flag, which is set to true by vpd_sections_init().
This leads to call of vpd_section_destroy() on already destroyed section
for probe-release-probe-release sequence if first probe performs
ro_vpd initialization and second probe does not initialize it.

The patch adds changing enabled flag on vpd_section_destroy and adds
cleanup on the error path of vpd_sections_init.
