mfd: madera: Add common support for Cirrus Logic Madera codecs

This adds the generic core support for Cirrus Logic "Madera" class codecs.
These are complex audio codec SoCs with a variety of digital and analogue
I/O, onboard audio processing and DSPs, and other features.

These codecs are all based off a common set of hardware IP so can be
supported by a core of common code (with a few minor device-to-device
variations).
