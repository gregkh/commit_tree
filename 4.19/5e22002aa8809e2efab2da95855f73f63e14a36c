isdn: Disable IIOCDBGVAR

It was possible to directly leak the kernel address where the isdn_dev
structure pointer was stored. This is a kernel ASLR bypass for anyone
with access to the ioctl. The code had been present since the beginning
of git history, though this shouldn't ever be needed for normal operation,
therefore remove it.
