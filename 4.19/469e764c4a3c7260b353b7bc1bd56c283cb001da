PCI: pciehp: Obey compulsory command delay after resume

Upon resume from system sleep, the Slot Control register is written via:

  pci_pm_resume_noirq()
    pci_pm_default_resume_early()
      pci_restore_state()
        pci_restore_pcie_state()

PCIe r4.0, sec 6.7.3.2 says that after "issuing a write transaction that
targets any portion of the Port's Slot Control register, [...] software
must wait for [the] command to complete before issuing the next command".

pciehp currently fails to enforce that rule after the above-mentioned
write.  Fix it.

(Moving restoration of the Slot Control register to pciehp doesn't seem
to make sense because the other PCIe hotplug drivers may need it as
well.)
