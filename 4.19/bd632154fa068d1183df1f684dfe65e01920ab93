staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page-8 Bit Mask definitions - Style

Remove unused 'page-8' Bit Mask definitions. These definitions fail the
checkpatch CamelCase naming test, since they are unused in code they have
simply been removed from code, rather then renamed. This is a coding
style change which should not impact runtime code execution.
