USB: add quirk for WORLDE Controller KS49 or Prodipe MIDI 49C USB controller

WORLDE Controller KS49 or Prodipe MIDI 49C USB controller
cause a -EPROTO error, a communication restart and loop again.

This issue has already been fixed for KS25.
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/753077/

I just add device 201 for KS49 in quirks.c to get it works.
