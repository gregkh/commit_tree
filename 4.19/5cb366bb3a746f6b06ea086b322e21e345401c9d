init/Kconfig: remove EXPERT from CHECKPOINT_RESTORE

The CHECKPOINT_RESTORE configuration option was introduced in 2012 and
combined with EXPERT.  CHECKPOINT_RESTORE is already enabled in many
distribution kernels and also part of the defconfigs of various
architectures.

To make it easier for distributions to enable CHECKPOINT_RESTORE this
removes EXPERT and moves the configuration option out of the EXPERT block.
