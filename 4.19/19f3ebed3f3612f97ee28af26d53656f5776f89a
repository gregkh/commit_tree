drm/sun4i: Add TCON TOP driver

As already described in DT binding, TCON TOP is responsible for
configuring display pipeline. In this initial driver focus is on HDMI
pipeline, so TVE and LCD configuration is not implemented.

Implemented features:
- HDMI source selection
- clock driver (TCON and DSI gating)
- connecting mixers and TCONS

Something similar also existed in previous SoCs, except that it was part
of first TCON.
