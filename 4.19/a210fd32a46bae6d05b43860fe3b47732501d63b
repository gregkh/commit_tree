kexec: add call to LSM hook in original kexec_load syscall

In order for LSMs and IMA-appraisal to differentiate between kexec_load
and kexec_file_load syscalls, both the original and new syscalls must
call an LSM hook.  This patch adds a call to security_kernel_load_data()
in the original kexec_load syscall.
