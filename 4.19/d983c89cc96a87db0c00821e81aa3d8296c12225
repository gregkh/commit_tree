s390/ftrace: Add -mfentry and -mnop-mcount support

Utilize -mfentry and -mnop-mcount gcc options together with
-mrecord-mcount to get compiler generated calls to the profiling functions
as nops which are compatible with current -mhotpatch=0,3 approach.  At the
same time -mrecord-mcount enables __mcount_loc section generation by
the compiler which allows to avoid using scripts/recordmcount.pl script.
