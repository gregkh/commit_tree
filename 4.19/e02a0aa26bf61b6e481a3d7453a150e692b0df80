block, bfq: always update the budget of an entity when needed

When the next child entity to serve changes for a given parent entity,
the budget of that parent entity must be updated accordingly.
Unfortunately, this update is not performed, by mistake, for the
entities that happen to switch from having no child entity to serve,
to having one child entity to serve.
