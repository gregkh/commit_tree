batman-adv: Prevent duplicated gateway_node entry

The function batadv_gw_node_add is responsible for adding new gw_node to
the gateway_list. It is expecting that the caller already checked that
there is not already an entry with the same key or not.

But the lock for the list is only held when the list is really modified.
This could lead to duplicated entries because another context could create
an entry with the same key between the check and the list manipulation.

The check and the manipulation of the list must therefore be in the same
locked code section.
