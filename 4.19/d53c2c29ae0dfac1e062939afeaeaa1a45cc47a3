KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Allow configuration of interrupt groups

Implement the required MMIO accessors for GICv2 and GICv3 for the
IGROUPR distributor and redistributor registers.

This can allow guests to change behavior compared to running on previous
versions of KVM, but only to align with the architecture and hardware
implementations.

This also allows userspace to configure the interrupts groups for GICv3.
We don't allow userspace to write the groups on GICv2 just yet, because
that would result in GICv2 guests not receiving interrupts after
migrating from an older kernel that exposes GICv2 interrupts as group 1.
