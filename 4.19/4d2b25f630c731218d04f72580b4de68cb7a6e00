locking/atomics: Instrument cmpxchg_double*()

We currently don't instrument cmpxchg_double() and
cmpxchg_double_local() due to compilation issues reported in the past,
which are supposedly related to GCC bug 72873 [1], reported when GCC 7
was not yet released. This bug only applies to x86-64, and does not
apply to other architectures.

While the test case for GCC bug 72873 triggers issues with released
versions of GCC, the instrumented kernel code compiles fine for all
configurations I have tried, and it is unclear how the two cases
are/were related.

As we can't reproduce the kernel build failures, let's instrument
cmpxchg_double*() again. We can revisit the issue if build failures
reappear.
