net: sock: Change tx_queue_mapping in sock_common to unsigned short

Change 'skc_tx_queue_mapping' field in sock_common structure from
'int' to 'unsigned short' type with ~0 indicating unset and
other positive queue values being set. This will accommodate adding
a new 'unsigned short' field in sock_common in the next patch for
rx_queue_mapping.
