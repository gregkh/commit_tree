Input: keyspan_remote - replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in keyspan_probe()

keyspan_probe() is never called in atomic context. It calls
usb_alloc_coherent() with GFP_ATOMIC, which is not necessary. GFP_ATOMIC
can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
