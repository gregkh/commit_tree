media: mt9v111: Fix build error with no VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API

The v4l2_subdev_get_try_format() function is only defined if the
VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API Kconfig option is enabled. Builds configured
without that symbol fails with:

drivers/media/i2c/mt9v111.c:801:10: error: implicit declaration of function
'v4l2_subdev_get_try_format';

Fix this by protecting the function call by testing for the right symbol.

media: mt9v111: fix random build errors

Fix the internal check for it to do the right thing if the
subdev API is not built.
