media: v4l2-ctrls: Fix CID base conflict between MAX217X and IMX

When the imx-media driver was initially merged, there was a conflict
with 8d67ae25 ("media: v4l2-ctrls: Reserve controls for MAX217X") which
was not fixed up correctly, resulting in V4L2_CID_USER_MAX217X_BASE and
V4L2_CID_USER_IMX_BASE taking on the same value. Fix by assigning imx
CID base the next available range at 0x10b0.
