libata: remove ata_sff_data_xfer_noirq()

ata_sff_data_xfer_noirq() is invoked via the ->sff_data_xfer hook. The
latter is invoked by ata_pio_sector(), atapi_send_cdb() and
__atapi_pio_bytes() which in turn is invoked by ata_sff_hsm_move().
The latter function requires that the "ap->lock" lock is held which
needs to be taken with disabled interrupts.

There is no need have to have ata_sff_data_xfer_noirq() which invokes
ata_sff_data_xfer32() with disabled interrupts because at this point the
interrupts are already disabled.
Remove the function and its references to it and replace all callers
with ata_sff_data_xfer32().
