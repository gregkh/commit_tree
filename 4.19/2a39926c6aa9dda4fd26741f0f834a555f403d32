powerpc/cpm1: fix compilation error with CONFIG_PPC_EARLY_DEBUG_CPM

commit e8cb7a55eb8dc ("powerpc: remove superflous inclusions of
asm/fixmap.h") removed inclusion of asm/fixmap.h from files not
including objects from that file.

However, asm/mmu-8xx.h includes  call to __fix_to_virt(). The proper
way would be to include asm/fixmap.h in asm/mmu-8xx.h but it creates
an inclusion loop.

So we have to leave asm/fixmap.h in sysdep/cpm_common.c for
CONFIG_PPC_EARLY_DEBUG_CPM
