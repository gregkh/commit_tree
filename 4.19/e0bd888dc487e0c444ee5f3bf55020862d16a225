crypto: arm64/aes-ce-gcm - implement 2-way aggregation

Implement a faster version of the GHASH transform which amortizes
the reduction modulo the characteristic polynomial across two
input blocks at a time.

On a Cortex-A53, the gcm(aes) performance increases 24%, from
3.0 cycles per byte to 2.4 cpb for large input sizes.
