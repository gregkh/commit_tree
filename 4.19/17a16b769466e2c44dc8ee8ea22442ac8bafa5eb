staging:rtl8192u: Remove typedef of cmpk_intr_sta_t - Style

Remove the typedef of struct cmpk_intr_sta_t, the name of the structure
has been left as cmd_pkt_interrupt_status. This clears the checkpatch
issue with creating new types in code. The change is purely a coding
style change and should have no impact on runtime code execution.
