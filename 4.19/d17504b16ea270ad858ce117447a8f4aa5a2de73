wireless/lib80211: Convert from ahash to shash

In preparing to remove all stack VLA usage from the kernel[1], this
removes the discouraged use of AHASH_REQUEST_ON_STACK in favor of
the smaller SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK by converting from ahash-wrapped-shash
to direct shash. The stack allocation will be made a fixed size in a
later patch to the crypto subsystem.
