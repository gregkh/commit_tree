drm/amd/display: add a check for display depth validity

[why]
HDMI 2.0 fails to validate 4K@60 timing with 10 bpc
[how]
Adding a helper function that would verify if the display depth
assigned would pass a bandwidth validation.
Drop the display depth by one level till calculated pixel clk
is lower than maximum TMDS clk.
