iomap: support direct I/O to inline data

Add support for reading from and writing to inline data to iomap_dio_rw.
This saves filesystems from having to implement fallback code for this
case.

The inline data is actually cached in the inode, so the I/O is only
direct in the sense that it doesn't go through the page cache.
