ALSA: timer: catch invalid timer object creation

A timer object for the classes SNDRV_TIMER_CLASS_CARD and
SNDRV_TIMER_CLASS_PCM has to be associated with a card object, but we
have no check at creation time.  Such a timer object with NULL card
causes various unexpected problems, e.g. NULL dereference at reading
the sound timer proc file.

So as preventive measure while the creating the sound timer object is
created the card information availability is checked for the mentioned
entries and returned error if its NULL.
