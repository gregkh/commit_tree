mm/sparse: add new sparse_init_nid() and sparse_init()

sparse_init() requires to temporary allocate two large buffers: usemap_map
and map_map.  Baoquan He has identified that these buffers are so large
that Linux is not bootable on small memory machines, such as a kdump boot.
The buffers are especially large when CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL is set, as they
are scaled to the maximum physical memory size.

Baoquan provided a fix, which reduces these sizes of these buffers, but it
is much better to get rid of them entirely.

Add a new way to initialize sparse memory: sparse_init_nid(), which only
operates within one memory node, and thus allocates memory either in large
contiguous block or allocates section by section.  This eliminates the
need for use of temporary buffers.

For simplified bisecting and review temporarly call sparse_init()
new_sparse_init(), the new interface is going to be enabled as well as old
code removed in the next patch.
