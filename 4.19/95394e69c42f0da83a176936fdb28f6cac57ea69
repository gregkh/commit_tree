rcu: Remove "inline" from panic_on_rcu_stall() and rcu_blocking_is_gp()

These functions are in kernel/rcu/tree.c, which is not an include file,
so there is no problem dropping the "inline", especially given that these
functions are nowhere near a fastpath.  This commit therefore delegates
the inlining decision to the compiler by dropping the "inline".
