scsi: libfc: Add WARN_ON() when deleting rports

The discovery rport list handling is quite odd; the list traversal is
independent from the lifetime of the rport itself. This makes auditing
quite tricky, and the chance remains that we've missed something.  So this
patch adds a WARN_ON() statement when freeing an rport which is still part
of a list.
