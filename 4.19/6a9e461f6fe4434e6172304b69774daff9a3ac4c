bonding: pass link-local packets to bonding master also.

Commit b89f04c61efe ("bonding: deliver link-local packets with
skb->dev set to link that packets arrived on") changed the behavior
of how link-local-multicast packets are processed. The change in
the behavior broke some legacy use cases where these packets are
expected to arrive on bonding master device also.

This patch passes the packet to the stack with the link it arrived
on as well as passes to the bonding-master device to preserve the
legacy use case.
