vt: introduce unicode mode for /dev/vcs

Now that the core vt code knows how to preserve unicode values for each
displayed character, it is then possible to let user space access it via
/dev/vcs*.

Unicode characters are presented as 32 bit values in native endianity
via the /dev/vcsu* devices, mimicking the simple /dev/vcs* devices.
Unicode with attributes (similarly to /dev/vcsa*) is not supported at
the moment.

Data is available only as long as the console is in UTF-8 mode. ENODATA
is returned otherwise.

This was tested with the latest development version (to become
version 5.7) of BRLTTY. Amongst other things, this allows ⠋⠕⠗ ⠞⠓⠊⠎
⠃⠗⠁⠊⠇⠇⠑⠀⠞⠑⠭⠞⠀to appear directly on braille displays regardless of the
console font being used.
