fsi: master-ast-cf: Add new FSI master using Aspeed ColdFire

The Aspeed AST2x00 can contain a ColdFire v1 coprocessor which
is currently unused on OpenPower systems.

This adds an alternative to the fsi-master-gpio driver that
uses that coprocessor instead of bit banging from the ARM
core itself. The end result is about 4 times faster.

The firmware for the coprocessor and its source code can be
found at https://github.com/ozbenh/cf-fsi and is system specific.
