HID: core: fix grouping by application

commit f07b3c1da92d ("HID: generic: create one input report per
application type") was effectively the same as MULTI_INPUT:
hidinput->report was never set, so hidinput_match_application()
always returned null.

Fix that by testing against the real application.

Note that this breaks some old eGalax touchscreens that expect MULTI_INPUT
instead of HID_QUIRK_INPUT_PER_APP. Enable this quirk for backward
compatibility on all non-Win8 touchscreens.
