mm: remove zone_id() and make use of zone_idx() in is_dev_zone()

is_dev_zone() is using zone_id() to check if the zone is ZONE_DEVICE.
zone_id() looks pretty much the same as zone_idx(), and while the use of
zone_idx() is quite spread in the kernel, zone_id() is only being used by
is_dev_zone().

This patch removes zone_id() and makes is_dev_zone() use zone_idx() to
check the zone, so we do not have two things with the same functionality
around.
