tty: serial: 8250: Revert NXP SC16C2552 workaround

Revert commit ecb988a3b7985913d1f0112f66667cdd15e40711: tty: serial:
8250: 8250_core: NXP SC16C2552 workaround

The above commit causes userland application to no longer write
correctly its first write to a dumb terminal connected to /dev/ttyS0.
This commit seems to be the culprit. It's as though the TX FIFO is being
reset during that write. What should be displayed is:

PSW 80000000 INST 00000000                           HALT
//

What is displayed is some variation of:

T 00000000           HAL//

Reverting this commit via this patch fixes my problem.
