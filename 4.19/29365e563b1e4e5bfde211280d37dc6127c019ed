rcu: Convert grace-period requests to ->gp_seq

This commit converts the grace-period request code paths from ->completed
and ->gpnum to ->gp_seq.  The need_future_gp_element() macro encapsulates
the shift operation required to use ->gp_seq as an index to the
->need_future_gp[] array.  The rcu_cbs_completed() function is removed
in favor of the rcu_seq_snap() function.  The rcu_start_this_gp()
gets some temporary consistency checks and uses rcu_seq_done(),
rcu_seq_current(), rcu_seq_state(), and rcu_gp_in_progress() in place
of the earlier open-coded comparisons of ->gpnum and ->completed.
The rcu_future_gp_cleanup() function replaces use of ->completed
with ->gp_seq.  The rcu_accelerate_cbs() function replaces a call to
rcu_cbs_completed() with one to rcu_seq_snap().  The rcu_advance_cbs()
function replaces an access to >completed with one to ->gp_seq and adds
some temporary warnings.  The rcu_nocb_wait_gp() function replaces a
call to rcu_cbs_completed() with one to rcu_seq_snap() and an open-coded
comparison with rcu_seq_done().

The temporary warnings will be removed when the various ->gpnum and
->completed fields are removed.  Their purpose is to locate code who
might still be using ->gpnum and ->completed.  (Much easier that way
than trying to trace down the causes of too-short grace periods and
grace-period hangs!)
