btrfs: use monotonic time for transaction handling

The transaction times were changed to ktime_get_real_seconds to avoid
the y2038 overflow, but they still have a minor problem when they go
backwards or jump due to settimeofday() or leap seconds.

This changes the transaction handling to instead use ktime_get_seconds(),
which returns a CLOCK_MONOTONIC timestamp that has neither of those
problems.
