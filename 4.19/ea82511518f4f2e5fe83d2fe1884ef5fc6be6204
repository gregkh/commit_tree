sch_cake: Add NAT awareness to packet classifier

When CAKE is deployed on a gateway that also performs NAT (which is a
common deployment mode), the host fairness mechanism cannot distinguish
internal hosts from each other, and so fails to work correctly.

To fix this, we add an optional NAT awareness mode, which will query the
kernel conntrack mechanism to obtain the pre-NAT addresses for each packet
and use that in the flow and host hashing.

When the shaper is enabled and the host is already performing NAT, the cost
of this lookup is negligible. However, in unlimited mode with no NAT being
performed, there is a significant CPU cost at higher bandwidths. For this
reason, the feature is turned off by default.
