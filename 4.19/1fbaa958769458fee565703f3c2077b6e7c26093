ARM: dts: keystone-k2g-ice: Enable netcp network driver

This patch adds dt bindings to enable netcp network driver on K2G
ICE boards. This consists of enabling bindings for NSS qmss, pktdma,
2u ethss, mdio, pinmux and netcp devices as well as DP83867 phy.

EVM hardware spec recommends to add 0.25 nsec delay in the tx direction
and 2.25 nsec delay in the rx direction for internal delay in the clock
path to be on the safer side.

The board straps RX_DV/RX_CTRL pin of on board DP83867 phy in mode 1.
The phy data manual disallows this. Add ti,dp83867-rxctrl-strap-quirk
in the phy node to allow software to enable the workaround suggested for
this incorrect strap setting. This ensures proper operation of this PHY.
