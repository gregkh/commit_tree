drm/i915: Flush the WCB following a WC write

If we have just completed a WC write, we must ensure that the WCB (Write
Combining Buffer) is flushed out to main memory before we can expect to
see the results. This is especially important when mixing WC with GTT as
the physical paths are different and cachelines are not naturally flushed.
