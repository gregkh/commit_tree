net: sched: call reoffload op on block callback reg

Call the reoffload tcf_proto_op on all tcf_proto nodes in all chains of a
block when a callback tries to register to a block that already has
offloaded rules. If all existing rules cannot be offloaded then the
registration is rejected. This replaces the previous policy of rejecting
such callback registration outright.

On unregistration of a callback, the rules are flushed for that given cb.
The implementation of block sharing in the NFP driver, for example,
duplicates shared rules to all devs bound to a block. This meant that
rules could still exist in hw even after a device is unbound from a block
(assuming the block still remains active).
