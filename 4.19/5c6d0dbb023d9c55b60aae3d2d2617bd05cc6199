staging: wilc1000: updated TODO file

Item [1] in TODO list is already addressed, so removed it from TODO file.

[1]. Move handling for each individual members of 'union message_body' out
into a separate 'struct work_struct' and completely remove the
multiplexerthat is currently part of host_if_work(), allowing movement
of the implementation of each message handler into the callsite of the
function that currently queues the 'host_if_msg'.
