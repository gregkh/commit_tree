act_ife: fix a potential deadlock

use_all_metadata() acquires read_lock(&ife_mod_lock), then calls
add_metainfo() which calls find_ife_oplist() which acquires the same
lock again. Deadlock!

Introduce __add_metainfo() which accepts struct tcf_meta_ops *ops
as an additional parameter and let its callers to decide how
to find it. For use_all_metadata(), it already has ops, no
need to find it again, just call __add_metainfo() directly.

And, as ife_mod_lock is only needed for find_ife_oplist(),
this means we can make non-atomic allocation for populate_metalist()
now.
