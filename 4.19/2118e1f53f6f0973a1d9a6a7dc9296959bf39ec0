posix-timers: Noralize good_sigevent

In good_sigevent directly compute the default return value as
"task_tgid(current)".  This is exactly the same as
"task_pid(current->group_leader)" but written more clearly.

In the thread case first compute the thread's pid.  Then veify that
attached to that pid is a thread of the current thread group.

This has the net effect of making the code a little clearer, and
making it obvious that posix timers never look up a process by a the
pid of a thread.
