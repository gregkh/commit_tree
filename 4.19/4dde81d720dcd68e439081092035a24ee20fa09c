media: venus: hfi_venus: move set of default properties to core init

This moves setting of default properties (firmware debug, idle
indicator and low power mode) from session init to core init.
All of those properties are need to be enabled/disabled early
so that they could be used before the clients are even initialized.

The other reason is to set idle indicator property early before
we enter into venus_suspend function where we need to check for
ARM9 WFI.
