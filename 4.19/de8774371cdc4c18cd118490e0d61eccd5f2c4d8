mei: check for error returned from mei_hbuf_empty_slots()

mei_hbuf_empty_slots() may return with an error in case
of circular buffer overflow. This type of error may
be caused only by a bug. However currently, the error
won't be detected due signed type promotion in comparison to u32.
We add explicit check for less then zero and explicit cast
in comparison to suppress singn-compare warning.
