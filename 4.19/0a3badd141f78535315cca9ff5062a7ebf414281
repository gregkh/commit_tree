ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Fix using the wrong GPIO for the ext-amp on some boards

Some boards have I2cSerialBusV2, GpioIo, GpioInt as ACPI resources, other
boards may  have I2cSerialBusV2, GpioInt, GpioIo instead. We want the
GpioIo one for the ext-amp-enable-gpio.

So far we've been assuming that the GpioIo one always comes first, this
commit adds code to detect which one comes first and to add the right
gpio-mapping.

This fixes sound not working on the Vios LTH17 laptop.
