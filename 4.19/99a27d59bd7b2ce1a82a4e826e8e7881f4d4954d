bcache: simplify the calculation of the total amount of flash dirty data

Currently we calculate the total amount of flash only devices dirty data
by adding the dirty data of each flash only device under registering
locker. It is very inefficient.

In this patch, we add a member flash_dev_dirty_sectors in struct cache_set
to record the total amount of flash only devices dirty data in real time,
so we didn't need to calculate the total amount of dirty data any more.
