KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Add group field to struct irq

In preparation for proper group 0 and group 1 support in the vgic, we
add a field in the struct irq to store the group of all interrupts.

We initialize the group to group 0 when emulating GICv2 and to group 1
when emulating GICv3, just like we treat them today.  LPIs are always
group 1.  We also continue to ignore writes from the guest, preserving
existing functionality, for now.

Finally, we also add this field to the vgic debug logic to show the
group for all interrupts.
