scsi: mpt3sas: As per MPI-spec, use combined reply queue for SAS3.5 controllers when HBA supports more than 16 MSI-x vectors.

Presently driver is using combined reply queue feature when MSI-x vectors >
8 for both SAS3 and SAS3.5 controllers.  But as per MPI-spec,

1. For SAS3 controllers, driver should use combined reply queue when HBA
supports more than 8 MSI-x vectors.

2. For SAS3.5 controllers, driver should use combined reply queue when HBA
supports more than 16 MSI-x vectors.

Modified driver code to use combined reply queue for SAS3 controllers when
HBA supports > 8 MSI-x vectors and for SAS3.5 controllers when HBA supports
> 16 MSI-x vectors.
