iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Fix pgtable allocation in selftest

Commit 4b123757eeaa ("iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Make allocations
NUMA-aware") added a NUMA hint to page table allocation, but the pgtable
selftest doesn't provide an SMMU device parameter. Since dev_to_node
doesn't accept a NULL argument, add a special case for selftest.
