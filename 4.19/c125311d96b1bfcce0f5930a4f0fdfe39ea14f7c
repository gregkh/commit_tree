blk-wbt: don't maintain inflight counts if disabled

A previous commit removed the ability to have per-rq flags. We used
those flags to maintain inflight counts. Since we don't have those
anymore, we have to always maintain inflight counts, even if wbt is
disabled. This is clearly suboptimal.

Add a queue quiesce around changing the wbt latency settings from sysfs
to work around this. With that, we can reliably put the enabled check in
our bio_to_wbt_flags(), since we know the WBT_TRACKED flag will be
consistent for the lifetime of the request.
