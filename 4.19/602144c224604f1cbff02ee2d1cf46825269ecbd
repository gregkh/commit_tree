bpf: offload: keep the offload state per-ASIC

Create a higher-level entity to represent a device/ASIC to allow
programs and maps to be shared between device ports.  The extra
work is required to make sure we don't destroy BPF objects as
soon as the netdev for which they were loaded gets destroyed,
as other ports may still be using them.  When netdev goes away
all of its BPF objects will be moved to other netdevs of the
device, and only destroyed when last netdev is unregistered.
