l2tp: simplify pppol2tp_ioctl()

* Drop test on 'sk': sock->sk cannot be NULL, or pppox_ioctl() could
    not have called us.

  * Drop test on 'SOCK_DEAD' state: if this flag was set, the socket
    would be in the process of being released and no ioctl could be
    running anymore.

  * Drop test on 'PPPOX_*' state: we depend on ->sk_user_data to get
    the session structure. If it is non-NULL, then the socket is
    connected. Testing for PPPOX_* is redundant.

  * Retrieve session using ->sk_user_data directly, instead of going
    through pppol2tp_sock_to_session(). This avoids grabbing a useless
    reference on the socket.
