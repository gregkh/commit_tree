staging:rtl8192u: Rename multiple variables - Style

All of the variables used within the structures of the union qos_tclas
cause checkpatch issue due to CamelCase naming. As none the member
variables are used in code all have been changed on one patch.

These changes are coding style in nature and should not impact runtime
code execution.
