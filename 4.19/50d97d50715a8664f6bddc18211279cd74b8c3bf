ida: Lock the IDA in ida_destroy

The user has no need to handle locking between ida_simple_get() and
ida_simple_remove().  They shouldn't be forced to think about whether
ida_destroy() might be called at the same time as any of their other
IDA manipulation calls.  Improve the documnetation while I'm in here.
