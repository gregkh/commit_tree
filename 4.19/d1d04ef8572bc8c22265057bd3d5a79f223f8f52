ovl: stack file ops

Implement file operations on a regular overlay file.  The underlying file
is opened separately and cached in ->private_data.

It might be worth making an exception for such files when accounting in
nr_file to confirm to userspace expectations.  We are only adding a small
overhead (248bytes for the struct file) since the real inode and dentry are
pinned by overlayfs anyway.

This patch doesn't have any effect, since the vfs will use d_real() to find
the real underlying file to open.  The patch at the end of the series will
actually enable this functionality.

AV: make it use open_with_fake_path(), don't mess with override_creds

SzM: still need to mess with override_creds() until no fs uses
current_cred() in their open method.
