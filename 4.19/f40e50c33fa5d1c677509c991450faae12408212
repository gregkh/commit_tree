staging:rtl8192u: Move QOS_TCLAS to rtl819x_TS.h - Style

Move the union QOS_TCLAS from the header file rtl819x_Qos.h to header
file rtl819x_TS.h, where the structure is actually used, as the member
of another structure.

This is a coding style change, which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
