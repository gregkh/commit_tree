staging: bcm2835-camera: fix timeout handling in wait_for_completion_timeout

wait_for_completion_timeout returns unsigned long not int so a variable of
proper type is introduced. Further the check for <= 0 is ambiguous and should
be == 0 here indicating timeout which is the only error case so no additional
check needed here.
