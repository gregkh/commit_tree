printk: Make CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET configurable

The goal of passing the "quiet" option to the kernel is for the kernel
to be quiet unless something really is wrong.

Sofar passing quiet has been (mostly) equivalent to passing
loglevel=4 on the kernel commandline. Which means to show any messages
with a level of KERN_ERR or higher severity on the console.

In practice this often does not result in a quiet boot though, since
there are many false-positive or otherwise harmless error messages printed,
defeating the purpose of the quiet option. Esp. the ACPICA code is really
bad wrt this, but there are plenty of others too.

This commit makes CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET configurable.

This for example will allow distros which want quiet to really mean quiet
to set CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET so that only messages with a higher severity
then KERN_ERR (CRIT, ALERT, EMERG) get printed, avoiding an endless game
of whack-a-mole silencing harmless error messages.
