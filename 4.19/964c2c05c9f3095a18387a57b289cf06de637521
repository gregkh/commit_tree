s390/mm: Clear huge page storage keys on enable_skey

When a guest starts using storage keys, we trap and set a default one
for its whole valid address space. With this patch we are now able to
do that for large pages.

To speed up the storage key insertion, we use
__storage_key_init_range, which in-turn will use sske_frame to set
multiple storage keys with one instruction. As it has been previously
used for debuging we have to get rid of the default key check and make
it quiescing.
