tracing: Remove orphaned function ftrace_nr_registered_ops()

Remove ftrace_nr_registered_ops() because it is no longer used.

ftrace_nr_registered_ops() has been introduced by commit ea701f11da44
("ftrace: Add selftest to test function trace recursion protection"), but
its caller has been removed by commit 05cbbf643b8e ("tracing: Fix selftest
function recursion accounting"). So it is not called anymore.
