kobject: kset_create_and_add() - fetch ownership info from parent

This change implements get_ownership() for ksets created with
kset_create_and_add() call by fetching ownership data from parent kobject.
This is done mostly for benefit of "queues" attribute of net devices so
that corresponding directory belongs to container's root instead of global
root for network devices in a container.
