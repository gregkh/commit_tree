drm/cma-helper: Use the generic fbdev emulation

This switches the CMA helper drivers that use its fbdev emulation over
to the generic fbdev emulation. It's the first phase of using generic
fbdev. A later phase will use DRM client callbacks for the
lastclose/hotplug/remove callbacks.

There are currently 2 fbdev init/fini functions:
- drm_fb_cma_fbdev_init/drm_fb_cma_fbdev_fini
- drm_fbdev_cma_init/drm_fbdev_cma_fini

This is because the work on generic fbdev came up during a fbdev
refactoring and thus wasn't completed. No point in completing that
refactoring when drivers will soon move to drm_fb_helper_generic_probe().

tinydrm uses drm_fb_cma_fbdev_init_with_funcs().
