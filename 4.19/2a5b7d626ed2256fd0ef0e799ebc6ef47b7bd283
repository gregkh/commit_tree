scsi: lpfc: Limit tracking of tgt queue depth in fast path

Performance is affected when target queue depth is tracked.  An atomic
counter is incremented on the submission path which competes with it being
decremented on the completion path.  In addition, multiple CPUs can
simultaniously be manipulating this counter for the same ndlp.

Reduce the overhead by only performing the target increment/decrement when
the target queue depth is less than the overall adapter depth, thus is
actually meaningful.
