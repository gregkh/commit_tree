arm/arm64: configs: Remove the MFD_ prefix for MFD_CROS_EC_I2C/SPI symbols.

The cros-ec I2C and SPI transport drivers have been moved from MFD
subsystem to platform/chrome, at the same time, the config symbol has
been renamed and lost the MFD_ prefix, so update all configs to the new
config symbol name.
