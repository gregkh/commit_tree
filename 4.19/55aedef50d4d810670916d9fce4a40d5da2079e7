pinctrl: intel: Do pin translation when lock IRQ

Default GPIOLIB callbacks for request and release IRQ do not do a GPIO
to pin translation which is necessary for Intel hardware, such as Intel
Cannonlake. Absence of the translation prevents some pins to be locked
as IRQ due to direction check. Introduce own callbacks to make
translation possible to avoid above issue.
