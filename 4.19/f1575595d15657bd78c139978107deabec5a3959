kconfig: error out when seeing recursive dependency

Originally, recursive dependency was a fatal error for Kconfig
because Kconfig cannot compute symbol values in such a situation.

Commit d595cea62403 ("kconfig: print more info when we see a recursive
dependency") changed it to a warning, which I guess was not intentional.

Get it back to an error again.

Also, rename the unit test directory "warn_recursive_dep" to
"err_recursive_dep" so that it matches to the behavior.
