dm cache: fix resize crash if user doesn't reload cache table

A reload of the cache's DM table is needed during resize because
otherwise a crash will occur when attempting to access smq policy
entries associated with the portion of the cache that was recently
extended.

The reason is cache-size based data structures in the policy will not be
resized, the only way to safely extend the cache is to allow for a
proper cache policy initialization that occurs when the cache table is
loaded.  For example the smq policy's space_init(), init_allocator(),
calc_hotspot_params() must be sized based on the extended cache size.

The fix for this is to disallow cache resizes of this pattern:
1) suspend "cache" target's device
2) resize the fast device used for the cache
3) resume "cache" target's device

Instead, the last step must be a full reload of the cache's DM table.
