x86/speculation/l1tf: Suggest what to do on systems with too much RAM

Two users have reported [1] that they have an "extremely unlikely" system
with more than MAX_PA/2 memory and L1TF mitigation is not effective.

Make the warning more helpful by suggesting the proper mem=X kernel boot
parameter to make it effective and a link to the L1TF document to help
decide if the mitigation is worth the unusable RAM.
