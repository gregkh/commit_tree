xfs: remove if_real_bytes

The field is only used for asserts, and to track if we really need to do
realloc when growing the inode fork data.  But the krealloc function
already performs this check internally, so there is no need to keep track
of the real allocation size.

This will free space in the inode fork for keeping a sequence counter of
changes to the extent list.
