bpf: introduce the bpf_get_local_storage() helper function

The bpf_get_local_storage() helper function is used
to get a pointer to the bpf local storage from a bpf program.

It takes a pointer to a storage map and flags as arguments.
Right now it accepts only cgroup storage maps, and flags
argument has to be 0. Further it can be extended to support
other types of local storage: e.g. thread local storage etc.
