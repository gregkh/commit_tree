brcmfmac: update STA info struct to the v5

That struct is used when querying firmware for the STA. It seem is has
been changing during the time. Luckily its format seems to be backward
compatible starting with v2 (the only breakage was v1 -> v2).

The version that was supported by brcmfmac so far was v4. It was what
43602a1 and 4366b1 firmwares (7.35.177.56 and 10.10.69.3309 accordingly)
were using. It also seems to be used by early 4366c0 firmwares
(10.10.69.6908 and 10.10.69.69017).

The problem appears when switching to the 10.10.122.20 firmware. It uses
v5 and instead of falling back to v4 when submitted buffer isn't big
enough it fallbacks to the v3.

To receive all v4 specific info with the newest firmware we have to
submit a struct (buffer) that matches v5.
