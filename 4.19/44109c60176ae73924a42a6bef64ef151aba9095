MIPS: Add DSP ASE regset support

Define an NT_MIPS_DSP core file note type and implement a corresponding
regset holding the DSP ASE register context, following the layout of the
`mips_dsp_state' structure, except for the DSPControl register stored as
a 64-bit rather than 32-bit quantity in a 64-bit note.

The lack of DSP ASE register saving to core files can be considered a
design flaw with commit e50c0a8fa60d ("Support the MIPS32 / MIPS64 DSP
ASE."), leading to an incomplete state being saved.  Consequently no DSP
ASE regset has been created with commit 7aeb753b5353 ("MIPS: Implement
task_user_regset_view."), when regset support was added to the MIPS
port.

Additionally there is no way for ptrace(2) to correctly access the DSP
accumulator registers in n32 processes with the existing interfaces.
This is due to 32-bit truncation of data passed with PTRACE_PEEKUSR and
PTRACE_POKEUSR requests, which cannot be avoided owing to how the data
types for ptrace(3) have been defined.  This new NT_MIPS_DSP regset
fills the missing interface gap.

[paul.burton@mips.com:
  - Change NT_MIPS_DSP to 0x800 to avoid conflict with NT_VMCOREDD
    introduced by commit 2724273e8fd0 ("vmcore: add API to collect
    hardware dump in second kernel").
  - Drop stable tag. Whilst I agree the lack of this functionality can
    be considered a flaw in earlier DSP ASE support, it's still new
    functionality which doesn't meet up to the requirements set out in
    Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst.]
