ALSA: usb-audio: Allow changing from a bad sample rate

If the audio device is externally clocked and set to a rate that does
not match the external clock, the clock will never be valid and we cannot
set the rate successfully. To fix this, allow a rate change even if
the clock is initially invalid, and validate again after the rate is
changed.

This fixes problems with MOTU UltraLite AVB hardware over USB.
