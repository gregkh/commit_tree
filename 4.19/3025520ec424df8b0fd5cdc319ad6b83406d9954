rcutorture: Use per-CPU random state for rcu_torture_timer()

Currently, the rcu_torture_timer() function uses a single global
torture_random_state structure protected by a single global lock.
This conflicts to some extent with performance and scalability,
but even more with the goal of consolidating read-side testing
with rcu_torture_reader().  This commit therefore creates a per-CPU
torture_random_state structure for use by rcu_torture_timer() and
eliminates the lock.
