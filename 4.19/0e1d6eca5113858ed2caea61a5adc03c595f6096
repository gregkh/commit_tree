rtnl: limit IFLA_NUM_TX_QUEUES and IFLA_NUM_RX_QUEUES to 4096

We have an impressive number of syzkaller bugs that are linked
to the fact that syzbot was able to create a networking device
with millions of TX (or RX) queues.

Let's limit the number of RX/TX queues to 4096, this really should
cover all known cases.

A separate patch will add various cond_resched() in the loops
handling sysfs entries at device creation and dismantle.

Tested:

lpaa6:~# ip link add gre-4097 numtxqueues 4097 numrxqueues 4097 type ip6gretap
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument

lpaa6:~# time ip link add gre-4096 numtxqueues 4096 numrxqueues 4096 type ip6gretap

real	0m0.180s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.107s
