drm/arm/hdlcd: Use drm_fb_cma_fbdev_init/fini()

Use drm_fb_cma_fbdev_init() and drm_fb_cma_fbdev_fini() which relies on
the fact that drm_device holds a pointer to the drm_fb_helper structure.
This means that the driver doesn't have to keep track of that.
Also use the drm_fb_helper functions directly.
