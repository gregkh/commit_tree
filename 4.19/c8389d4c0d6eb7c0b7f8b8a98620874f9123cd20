btrfs: qgroup: cleanup the unused srcroot from btrfs_qgroup_inherit

Since commit 0b246afa62b0 ("btrfs: root->fs_info cleanup, add fs_info
convenience variables"), the srcroot is no longer used to get
fs_info::nodesize.  In fact, it can be dropped after commit 707e8a071528
("btrfs: use nodesize everywhere, kill leafsize").
