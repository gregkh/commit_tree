configfs: fix registered group removal

This patch fixes a bug where configfs_register_group had added
a group in a tree, and userspace has done a rmdir on a dir somewhere
above that group and we hit a kernel crash. The problem is configfs_rmdir
will detach everything under it and unlink groups on the default_groups
list. It will not unlink groups added with configfs_register_group so when
configfs_unregister_group is called to drop its references to the group/items
we crash when we try to access the freed dentrys.

The patch just adds a check for if a rmdir has been done above
us and if so just does the unlink part of unregistration.

Sorry if you are getting this multiple times. I thouhgt I sent
this to some of you and lkml, but I do not see it.
