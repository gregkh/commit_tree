scsi: ufs: remove unnecessary query(DM) UPIU trace

This patch removes redundant trace that occurs when sending Device
Management(DM) request (fix behavior in commit 6667e6d91c88 ("scsi:
ufs: add trace event for ufs upiu").

Since the function send_command is called also for DM request, UPIU
trace for DM request is called twice- one identified as query_* the
other as send/complete.
