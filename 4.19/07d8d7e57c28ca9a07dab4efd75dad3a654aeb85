PCI: Make specifying PCI devices in kernel parameters reusable

Separate out the code to match a PCI device with a string (typically
originating from a kernel parameter) from the
pci_specified_resource_alignment() function into its own helper function.

While we are at it, this change fixes the kernel style of the function
(fixing a number of long lines and extra parentheses).

Additionally, make the analogous change to the kernel parameter
documentation: Separate the description of how to specify a PCI device
into its own section at the head of the "pci=" parameter.

This patch should have no functional alterations.
