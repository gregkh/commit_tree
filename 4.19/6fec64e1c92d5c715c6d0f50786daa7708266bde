posix-timers: Make forward callback return s64

The posix timer ti_overrun handling is broken because the forwarding
functions can return a huge number of overruns which does not fit in an
int. As a consequence timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun can turn
into random number generators.

As a first step to address that let the timer_forward() callbacks return
the full 64 bit value.

Cast it to (int) temporarily until k_itimer::ti_overrun is converted to
64bit and the conversion to user space visible values is sanitized.
