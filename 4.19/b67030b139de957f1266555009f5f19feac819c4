fjes: use currently unused variable my_epid and max_epid

Variables my_epid and max_epid are currently assigned and not being
used - however, I suspect they were intended to be used in the for-loops
to reduce the dereferencing of hw.  Replace hw->my_epid and hw->max_epid
with these variables.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: variable 'my_epid' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
variable 'max_epid' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
