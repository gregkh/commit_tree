r8169: Enable MSI-X on RTL8106e

Originally, we have an issue where r8169 MSI-X interrupt is broken after
S3 suspend/resume on RTL8106e of ASUS X441UAR.

We found the all of the values in PCI BAR=4 of the ethernet adapter
become 0xFF after system resumes.  That breaks the MSI-X interrupt.
Therefore, we can only fall back to MSI interrupt to fix the issue at
that time.

However, there is a commit which resolves the drivers getting nothing in
PCI BAR=4 after system resumes.  It is 04cb3ae895d7 "PCI: Reprogram
bridge prefetch registers on resume" by Daniel Drake.

After apply the patch, the ethernet adapter works fine before suspend
and after resume.  So, we can revert the workaround after the commit
"PCI: Reprogram bridge prefetch registers on resume" is merged into main
tree.

This patch reverts commit 7bb05b85bc2d1a1b647b91424b2ed4a18e6ecd81
"r8169: don't use MSI-X on RTL8106e".
