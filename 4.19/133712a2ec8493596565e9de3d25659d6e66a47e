checkpatch: DT bindings should be a separate patch

Devicetree bindings should be their own patch as documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/submitting-patches.txt section I.1.
This is because bindings are logically independent from a driver
implementation, they have a different maintainer (even though they often
are applied via the same tree), and it makes for a cleaner history in the
DT only tree created with git-filter-branch.
