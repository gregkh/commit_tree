iomap: generic inline data handling

Add generic inline data handling by adding a pointer to the inline data
region to struct iomap.  When handling a buffered IOMAP_INLINE write,
iomap_write_begin will copy the current inline data from the inline data
region into the page cache, and iomap_write_end will copy the changes in
the page cache back to the inline data region.

This doesn't cover inline data reads and direct I/O yet because so far,
we have no users.
