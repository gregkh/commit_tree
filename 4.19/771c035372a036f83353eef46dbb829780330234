deprecate the '__deprecated' attribute warnings entirely and for good

We haven't had lots of deprecation warnings lately, but the rdma use of
it made them flare up again.

They are not useful.  They annoy everybody, and nobody ever does
anything about them, because it's always "somebody elses problem".  And
when people start thinking that warnings are normal, they stop looking
at them, and the real warnings that mean something go unnoticed.

If you want to get rid of a function, just get rid of it.  Convert every
user to the new world order.

And if you can't do that, then don't annoy everybody else with your
marking that says "I couldn't be bothered to fix this, so I'll just spam
everybody elses build logs with warnings about my laziness".

Make a kernelnewbies wiki page about things that could be cleaned up,
write a blog post about it, or talk to people on the mailing lists.  But
don't add warnings to the kernel build about cleanup that you think
should happen but you aren't doing yourself.

Don't.  Just don't.
