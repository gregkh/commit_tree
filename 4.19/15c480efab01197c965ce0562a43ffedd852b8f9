bpf, sockmap: fix psock refcount leak in bpf_tcp_recvmsg

In bpf_tcp_recvmsg() we first took a reference on the psock, however
once we find that there are skbs in the normal socket's receive queue
we return with processing them through tcp_recvmsg(). Problem is that
we leak the taken reference on the psock in that path. Given we don't
really do anything with the psock at this point, move the skb_queue_empty()
test before we fetch the psock to fix this case.
