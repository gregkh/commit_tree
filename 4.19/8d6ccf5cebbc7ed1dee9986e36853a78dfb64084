soundwire: Fix acquiring bus lock twice during master release

As part of sdw_stream_remove_master(), sdw_stream_remove_slave() is called
which results in bus lock being acquired twice.

So, fix it by performing specific Slave remove operations in
sdw_release_master_stream() instead of calling sdw_stream_remove_slave().
