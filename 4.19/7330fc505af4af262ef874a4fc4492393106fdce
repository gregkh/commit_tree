mtd: rawnand: qcom: stop using phys_to_dma()

Compile-testing this driver on x86 caused a link error:

ERROR: "__phys_to_dma" [drivers/mtd/nand/raw/qcom_nandc.ko] undefined!

The problem here is that the driver attempts to convert the physical
address into the DMA controller as a dma_addr_t and calls phys_to_dma()
to do the conversion.

The correct way to do the conversion is using the dma mapping interfaces.
