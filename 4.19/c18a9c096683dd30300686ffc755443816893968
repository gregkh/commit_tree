net: stmmac_tc: use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Add suffix UL to constant 1024 in order to give the compiler complete
information about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice that this
constant is used in a context that expects an expression of type
u64 (64 bits, unsigned) and  following expressions are currently
being evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic:

qopt->idleslope * 1024 * ptr
qopt->hicredit * 1024 * 8
qopt->locredit * 1024 * 8
