scsi: target: Simplify core_tmr_handle_tas_abort()

The code that can set CMD_T_TAS is executed by the same thread as the
thread that executes core_tmr_handle_tas_abort(). That means that no
locking is needed to check CMD_T_TAS from inside
core_tmr_handle_tas_abort(). This patch does not change any functionality.
