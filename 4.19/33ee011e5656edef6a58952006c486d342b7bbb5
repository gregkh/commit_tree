mm/swapfile.c: unify normal/huge code path in swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()

As suggested by Dave, we should unify the code path for normal and huge
swap support if possible to avoid duplicated code, bugs, etc.  and make
it easier to review code.

In this patch, the normal/huge code path in
swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() is unified, the added and removed lines
are same.  And the binary size is kept almost same when
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=n.
