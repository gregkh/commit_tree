powerpc/pseries: fix EEH recovery of some IOV devices

EEH recovery currently fails on pSeries for some IOV capable PCI
devices, if CONFIG_PCI_IOV is on and the hypervisor doesn't provide
certain device tree properties for the device. (Found on an IOV
capable device using the ipr driver.)

Recovery fails in pci_enable_resources() at the check on r->parent,
because r->flags is set and r->parent is not.  This state is due to
sriov_init() setting the start, end and flags members of the IOV BARs
but the parent not being set later in
pseries_pci_fixup_iov_resources(), because the
"ibm,open-sriov-vf-bar-info" property is missing.

Correct this by zeroing the resource flags for IOV BARs when they
can't be configured (this is the same method used by sriov_init() and
__pci_read_base()).

VFs cleared this way can't be enabled later, because that requires
another device tree property, "ibm,number-of-configurable-vfs" as well
as support for the RTAS function "ibm_map_pes". These are all part of
hypervisor support for IOV and it seems unlikely that a hypervisor
would ever partially, but not fully, support it. (None are currently
provided by QEMU/KVM.)
