drm/syncobj: Don't leak fences when WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT is set

We attempt to get fences earlier in the hopes that everything will
already have fences and no callbacks will be needed.  If we do succeed
in getting a fence, getting one a second time will result in a duplicate
ref with no unref.  This is causing memory leaks in Vulkan applications
that create a lot of fences; playing for a few hours can, apparently,
bring down the system.
