drm/atomic: Use drm_drv_uses_atomic_modeset() for debugfs creation

As pointed out by Daniel Vetter, we should be usinng
drm_drv_uses_atomic_modeset() for determining whether or not we want to
make the debugfs nodes for atomic instead of checking DRIVER_ATOMIC, as
the former isn't an accurate representation of whether or not the driver
is actually using atomic modesetting internally (even though it might
not be exposing atomic capabilities).
