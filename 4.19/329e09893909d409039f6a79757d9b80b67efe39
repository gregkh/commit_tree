treewide: Replace more open-coded allocation size multiplications

As done treewide earlier, this catches several more open-coded
allocation size calculations that were added to the kernel during the
merge window. This performs the following mechanical transformations
using Coccinelle:

	kvmalloc(a * b, ...) -> kvmalloc_array(a, b, ...)
	kvzalloc(a * b, ...) -> kvcalloc(a, b, ...)
	devm_kzalloc(..., a * b, ...) -> devm_kcalloc(..., a, b, ...)
