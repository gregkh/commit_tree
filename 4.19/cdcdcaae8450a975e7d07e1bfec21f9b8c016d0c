scsi: virtio_scsi: fix pi_bytes{out,in} on 4 KiB block size devices

When the underlying device is a 4 KiB logical block size device with a
protection interval exponent of 0, i.e. 4096 bytes data + 8 bytes PI, the
driver miscalculates the pi_bytes{out,in} by a factor of 8x (64 bytes).

This leads to errors on all reads and writes on 4 KiB logical block size
devices when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INTEGRITY is enabled and the
VIRTIO_SCSI_F_T10_PI feature bit has been negotiated.
