scsi: atp870u: Replace mdelay() with msleep()

tscam(), atp870_init(), atp880_init() and atp885_init() are never
called in atomic context.
They call mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
