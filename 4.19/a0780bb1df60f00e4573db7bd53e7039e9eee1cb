drm/etnaviv: protect sched job submission with fence mutex

The documentation of drm_sched_job_init and drm_sched_entity_push_job has
been clarified. Both functions should be called under a shared lock, to
avoid jobs getting pushed into the scheduler queue in a different order
than their sched_fence seqnos, which will confuse checks that are looking
at the seqnos to infer information about completion order.
