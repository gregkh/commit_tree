platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Add support for dock mode detection

The Dell laptop I have has an ACPI that sends 0xCB and 0xCC on entering
tablet mode.  On exiting tablet mode it sends 0xCA and 0xCD. Based on:

It appears that 0xCA and 0xCB are about dock mode, which for my
convertible laptop seems questionably tied to whether I've put
the laptop in tablet or laptop mode.  I previously proposed no-oping
0xCA and 0xCB but this revised change attempts to add support for
detecting dock mode--this detection will essentially be broken for
my laptop (the main workaround would be for 0xCA and 0xCB to be used
to provoke a query of the VGBS method that reports the current dock &
tablet mode [which is accurately reported on my laptop but based on
the prior workarounds in the driver it apparently can't be trusted
for all systems]).
