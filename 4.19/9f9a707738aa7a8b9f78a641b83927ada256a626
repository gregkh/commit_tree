rhashtable: remove nulls_base and related code.

This "feature" is unused, undocumented, and untested and so doesn't
really belong.  A patch is under development to properly implement
support for detecting when a search gets diverted down a different
chain, which the common purpose of nulls markers.

This patch actually fixes a bug too.  The table resizing allows a
table to grow to 2^31 buckets, but the hash is truncated to 27 bits -
any growth beyond 2^27 is wasteful an ineffective.

This patch results in NULLS_MARKER(0) being used for all chains,
and leaves the use of rht_is_a_null() to test for it.
