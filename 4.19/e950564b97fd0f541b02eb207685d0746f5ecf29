vfs: don't evict uninitialized inode

iput() ends up calling ->evict() on new inode, which is not yet initialized
by owning fs.  So use destroy_inode() instead.

Add to sb->s_inodes list only if inode is not in I_CREATING state (meaning
that it wasn't allocated with new_inode(), which already does the
insertion).
