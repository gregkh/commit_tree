drm/vkms: Introduce basic VKMS driver

This patch introduces Virtual Kernel Mode-Setting (VKMS) driver. It
creates a very basic kms driver with 1 crtc/encoder/connector/plane.

VKMS driver would be useful for testing, or for running X (or similar)
on headless machines and be able to still use the GPU. Thus it enables
a virtual display without the need for hardware display capability.
