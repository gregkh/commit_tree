drm/vc4: Use wait_for_flip_done() instead of wait_for_vblanks()

drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks() assumes the CRTC will continuously
generate VBLANK events and the vblank counter will keep increasing.
While this work for a regular pipeline, it doesn't when you have the
CRTC is feeding the transposer block, because this block works in
oneshot mode, and, by the time we reach
drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks() the only VBLANK event might have
already been sent and the VBLANK counter will stay unchanged, thus
triggering a timeout.

Luckily, we can replace the drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks() call
by drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_flip_done() because the only thing we
want to check when calling drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks() from
vc4_atomic_complete_commit() is that new FBs are in use and the old
ones can be safely released.
