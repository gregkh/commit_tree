MAINTAINERS: Move mobiveil PCI driver entry where it belongs

Commit 92f9ccca4c08 ("PCI: mobiveil: Add Mobiveil PCIe Host Bridge IP
driver DT bindings") managed to add a MAINTAINERS entry where it does
not really belong (ie in the middle of a totally unrelated series of
entries and in the wrong alphabetical order).

Fix it.
