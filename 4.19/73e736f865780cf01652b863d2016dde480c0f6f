mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: disable clocks before changing frequency

In the uSDHC case (e.g. i.MX 6) clocks only get disabled if frequency
is set to 0. However, it could be that the stack asks for a frequency
change while clocks are on. In that case the function clears the
divider registers (by clearing ESDHC_CLOCK_MASK) while the clock is
enabled! This causes a short period of time where the clock is
undivided (on a i.MX 6DL a clock of 196MHz has been measured).

For older IP variants the driver disables clock by clearing some bits
in ESDHC_SYSTEM_CONTROL.

Make sure to disable card clock before changing frequency for uSDHC
IP variants too.
