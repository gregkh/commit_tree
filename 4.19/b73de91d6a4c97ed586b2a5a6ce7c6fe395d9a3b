rcu: Rename the grace-period-request variables and parameters

The name 'c' is used for variables and parameters holding the requested
grace-period sequence number.  However it is no longer very meaningful
given the conversions from ->gpnum and (especially) ->completed to
->gp_seq. This commit therefore renames 'c' to 'gp_seq_req'.
