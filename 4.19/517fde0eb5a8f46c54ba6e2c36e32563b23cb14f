i2c: aspeed: Fix initial values of master and slave state

This patch changes the order of enum aspeed_i2c_master_state and
enum aspeed_i2c_slave_state defines to make their initial value to
ASPEED_I2C_MASTER_INACTIVE and ASPEED_I2C_SLAVE_STOP respectively.
In case of multi-master use, if a slave data comes ahead of the
first master xfer, master_state starts from an invalid state so
this change fixes the issue.
