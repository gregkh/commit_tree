net/sched: Add HW offloading capability to ETF

Add infra so etf qdisc supports HW offload of time-based transmission.

For hw offload, the time sorted list is still used, so packets are
dequeued always in order of txtime.

Example:

$ tc qdisc replace dev enp2s0 parent root handle 100 mqprio num_tc 3 \
           map 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 queues 1@0 1@1 2@2 hw 0

$ tc qdisc add dev enp2s0 parent 100:1 etf offload delta 100000 \
	   clockid CLOCK_REALTIME

In this example, the Qdisc will use HW offload for the control of the
transmission time through the network adapter. The hrtimer used for
packets scheduling inside the qdisc will use the clockid CLOCK_REALTIME
as reference and packets leave the Qdisc "delta" (100000) nanoseconds
before their transmission time. Because this will be using HW offload and
since dynamic clocks are not supported by the hrtimer, the system clock
and the PHC clock must be synchronized for this mode to behave as
expected.
