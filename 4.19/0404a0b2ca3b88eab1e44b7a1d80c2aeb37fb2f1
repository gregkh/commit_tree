platform/x86: mlx-platform: Add ASIC hotplug device configuration

Add support for ASIC hotplug device events for the all system types. The
ASIC hotplug event is sent in cases ASIC reaches the good health state or
dropped to the bad health state. The health state is used to change, when
device is reset or in case of some system failures. In such cases hwmon
uevent notification will be sent.
