s390/qeth: fine-tune RX modesetting

Changing a device's address lists (or its promisc mode) already triggers
an RX modeset, there's no need to do it manually from the L2 driver's
ndo_vlan_rx_kill_vid() hook.

Also when setting a device online, dev_open() already calls
dev_set_rx_mode(). So a manual modeset is only necessary from the
recovery path.
