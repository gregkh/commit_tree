arm64: topology: add support to remove cpu topology sibling masks

This patch adds support to remove all the CPU topology information using
clear_cpu_topology and also resetting the sibling information on other
sibling CPUs. This will be used in cpu_disable so that all the topology
sibling information is removed on CPU hotplug out.
