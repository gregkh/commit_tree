drm/i915/execlists: Reset CSB write pointer after reset

On HW reset, the HW clears the write pointer (to 0). But since it also
writes its first CSB entry to slot 0, we need to reset the write pointer
back to the element before (so the first entry we read is 0).

This is required for the next patch, where we trust the CSB completely!

v2: Use _MASKED_FIELD
v3: Store the reset value, so that we differentiate between mmio/hwsp
transparently and without pretense.
