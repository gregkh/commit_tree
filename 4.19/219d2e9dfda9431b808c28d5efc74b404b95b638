RDMA/cma: Simplify rdma_resolve_addr() error flow

Currently dst address is first set and later on cleared on either of the
3 error conditions are met.
However none of the APIs or checks are supposed to refer to the
destination address of the cm_id.
Therefore, set the destination address after necessary checks pass which
simplifies the error flow.
