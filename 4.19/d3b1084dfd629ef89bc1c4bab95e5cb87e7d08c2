vfs: make open_with_fake_path() not contribute to nr_files

Stacking file operations in overlay will store an extra open file for each
overlay file opened.

The overhead is just that of "struct file" which is about 256bytes, because
overlay already pins an extra dentry and inode when the file is open, which
add up to a much larger overhead.

For fear of breaking working setups, don't start accounting the extra file.
