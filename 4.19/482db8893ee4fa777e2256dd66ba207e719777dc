ARM: davinci: da850: add new clock init using common clock framework

This adds the new board-specific clock init in mach-davinci/da850.c
using the new common clock framework drivers.

The #ifdefs are needed to prevent compile errors until the entire
ARCH_DAVINCI is converted.

Also clean up the #includes since we are adding some here.

Some CFGCHIP macros were removed because we are now including
linux/mfd/da8xx-cfgchip.h which defines the same values.
