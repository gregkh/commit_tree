mm, page_alloc: actually ignore mempolicies for high priority allocations

__alloc_pages_slowpath() has for a long time contained code to ignore
node restrictions from memory policies for high priority allocations.
The current code that resets the zonelist iterator however does
effectively nothing after commit 7810e6781e0f ("mm, page_alloc: do not
break __GFP_THISNODE by zonelist reset") removed a buggy zonelist reset.
Even before that commit, mempolicy restrictions were still not ignored,
as they are passed in ac->nodemask which is untouched by the code.

We can either remove the code, or make it work as intended.  Since
ac->nodemask can be set from task's mempolicy via alloc_pages_current()
and thus also alloc_pages(), it may indeed affect kernel allocations,
and it makes sense to ignore it to allow progress for high priority
allocations.

Thus, this patch resets ac->nodemask to NULL in such cases.  This
assumes all callers can handle it (i.e.  there are no guarantees as in
the case of __GFP_THISNODE) which seems to be the case.  The same
assumption is already present in check_retry_cpuset() for some time.

The expected effect is that high priority kernel allocations in the
context of userspace tasks (e.g.  OOM victims) restricted by mempolicies
will have higher chance to succeed if they are restricted to nodes with
depleted memory, while there are other nodes with free memory left.

It's not a new intention, but for the first time the code will match the
intention, AFAICS.  It was intended by commit 183f6371aac2 ("mm: ignore
mempolicies when using ALLOC_NO_WATERMARK") in v3.6 but I think it never
really worked, as mempolicy restriction was already encoded in nodemask,
not zonelist, at that time.

So originally that was for ALLOC_NO_WATERMARK only.  Then it was
adjusted by e46e7b77c909 ("mm, page_alloc: recalculate the preferred
zoneref if the context can ignore memory policies") and cd04ae1e2dc8
("mm, oom: do not rely on TIF_MEMDIE for memory reserves access") to the
current state.  So even GFP_ATOMIC would now ignore mempolicies after
the initial attempts fail - if the code worked as people thought it
does.
