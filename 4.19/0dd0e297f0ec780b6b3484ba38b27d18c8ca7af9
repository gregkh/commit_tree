vfio-pci: Disable binding to PFs with SR-IOV enabled

We expect to receive PFs with SR-IOV disabled, however some host
drivers leave SR-IOV enabled at unbind.  This puts us in a state where
we can potentially assign both the PF and the VF, leading to both
functionality as well as security concerns due to lack of managing the
SR-IOV state as well as vendor dependent isolation from the PF to VF.
If we were to attempt to actively disable SR-IOV on driver probe, we
risk VF bound drivers blocking, potentially risking live lock
scenarios.  Therefore simply refuse to bind to PFs with SR-IOV enabled
with a warning message indicating the issue.  Users can resolve this
by re-binding to the host driver and disabling SR-IOV before
attempting to use the device with vfio-pci.
