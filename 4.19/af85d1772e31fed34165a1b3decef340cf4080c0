audit: Fix extended comparison of GID/EGID

The audit_filter_rules() function in auditsc.c used the in_[e]group_p()
functions to check GID/EGID match, but these functions use the current
task's credentials, while the comparison should use the credentials of
the task given to audit_filter_rules() as a parameter (tsk).

Note that we can use group_search(cred->group_info, ...) as a
replacement for both in_group_p and in_egroup_p as these functions only
compare the parameter to cred->fsgid/egid and then call group_search.

In fact, the usage of in_group_p was even more incorrect: it compares to
cred->fsgid (which is usually equal to cred->egid) and not cred->gid.
