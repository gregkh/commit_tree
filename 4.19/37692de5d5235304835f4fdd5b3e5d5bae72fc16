i2c: i2c-qcom-geni: Add bus driver for the Qualcomm GENI I2C controller

This bus driver supports the GENI based i2c hardware controller in the
Qualcomm SOCs. The Qualcomm Generic Interface (GENI) is a programmable
module supporting a wide range of serial interfaces including I2C. The
driver supports FIFO mode and DMA mode of transfer and switches modes
