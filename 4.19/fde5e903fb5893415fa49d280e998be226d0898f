scripts/spdxcheck.py: work with current HEAD LICENSES/ directory

Depending on how old your -next tree is, it may not have a master that
has the LICENSES directory.

Change the lookup to HEAD and find whatever LICENSE directory files are
used in that branch.

Miscellanea:

 - Remove the checkpatch test as it will have its own SPDX license
   identifier.
