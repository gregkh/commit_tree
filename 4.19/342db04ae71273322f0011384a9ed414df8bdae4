x86/dumpstack: Don't dump kernel memory based on usermode RIP


show_opcodes() is used both for dumping kernel instructions and for dumping
user instructions. If userspace causes #PF by jumping to a kernel address,
show_opcodes() can be reached with regs->ip controlled by the user,
pointing to kernel code. Make sure that userspace can't trick us into
dumping kernel memory into dmesg.
