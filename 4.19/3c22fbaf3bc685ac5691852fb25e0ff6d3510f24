staging:rtl8192u: Remove typedef and rename struct RT_DOT11D_INFO - Style

Removed the typedef from structure RT_DOT11D_INFO. This change clears the
checkpatch issue with declaring new types.

Rename the structure from RT_DOT11D_INFO to rt_dot11d_info.

Coding style changes which should not impact runtime execution of code.
