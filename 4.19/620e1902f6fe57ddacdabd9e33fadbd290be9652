fpga: dfl: fme: add DFL_FPGA_GET_API_VERSION/CHECK_EXTENSION ioctls support

DFL_FPGA_GET_API_VERSION and DFL_FPGA_CHECK_EXTENSION ioctls are common
ones which need to be supported by all feature devices drivers including
FME and AFU. Userspace application can use these ioctl interfaces to get
the API info and check if specific extension is supported or not in
current driver.

This patch implements above 2 ioctls in FPGA Management Engine (FME)
driver.
