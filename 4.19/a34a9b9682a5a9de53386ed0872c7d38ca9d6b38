parisc: merge pcx_dma_ops and pcxl_dma_ops

The only difference is that pcxl supports dma coherent allocations, while
pcx only supports non-consistent allocations and otherwise fails.

But dma_alloc* is not in the fast path, and merging these two allows an
easy migration path to the generic dma-noncoherent implementation, so
do it.
