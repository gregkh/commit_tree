media: usb: em28xx: Replace mdelay() with msleep() in em28xx_pre_card_setup()

em28xx_pre_card_setup() is never called in atomic context.
It calls mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
