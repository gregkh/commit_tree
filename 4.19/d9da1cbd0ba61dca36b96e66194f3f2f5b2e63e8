staging: gasket: apex: drop reset type param

Apex doesn't implement different types of resets based on the reset type
param passed through the gasket layer or from userspace via the
gasket_reset ioctl.  The reset type is dropped from the gasket framework
in a previous patch due to a lack of present need and non-conforming use
of this parameter by the framework.  Drop the parameter from the apex
driver as well.
