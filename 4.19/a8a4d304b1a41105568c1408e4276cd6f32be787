media: i2c: vs6624: Replace mdelay() with msleep() and usleep_range() in vs6624_probe()

vs6624_probe() is never called in atomic context.
It calls mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep() and usleep_range().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
