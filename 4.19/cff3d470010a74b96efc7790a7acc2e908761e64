staging:rtl8192u: Refactor enum dm_dig_cs_ratio_e - Style

The enumerated type dm_dig_cs_ratio_e is never actually used as a type,
but only as a collection of related constants. This is because the
variables, which use the defined constant values, are defined as being
of type u8 rather then tne enumerated type. This omission negates the
possibility of taking advantage of compiler type checking.

To enable the use of compiler type checking of the enumeration the two
variables, (curcs_ratio_state & precs_ratio_state), which use the type's
constants have their types changed from u8 to enum dig_cck_cs_ratio_state.

Additionally the types declaration has been moved above the dig
structure, where the type is used. The 'typedef' keyword has been
removed from the type to clear the checkpatch issue with defining new
types. And the constant DIG_CS_MAX has been removed since this is never
used in the code.

These changes are purely coding style changes and should not impact
on runtime code execution.
