cifs: check if SMB2 PDU size has been padded and suppress the warning

Some SMB2/3 servers, Win2016 but possibly others too, adds padding
not only between PDUs in a compound but also to the final PDU.
This padding extends the PDU to a multiple of 8 bytes.

Check if the unexpected length looks like this might be the case
and avoid triggering the log messages for :

  "SMB2 server sent bad RFC1001 len %d not %d\n"
