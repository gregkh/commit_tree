net: tipc: name_table: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in tipc_nametbl_init()

tipc_nametbl_init() is never called in atomic context.
It calls kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC, which is not necessary.
GFP_ATOMIC can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
