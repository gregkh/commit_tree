crypto: ccp - Fix command completion detection race

The wait_event() function is used to detect command completion.  The
interrupt handler will set the wait condition variable when the interrupt
is triggered.  However, the variable used for wait_event() is initialized
after the command has been submitted, which can create a race condition
with the interrupt handler and result in the wait_event() never returning.
Move the initialization of the wait condition variable to just before
command submission.
