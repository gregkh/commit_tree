IB/hfi1: Move rhf_offset from devdata to ctxtdata

This field should be in ctxtdata to allow for better locality of access by
eliminating a dd dereference.

The new field is now side-by-side with rcvhdrqentsize since the rhf_offset
is a function of the rcvhdrqentsize.

Both fields are now correctly sized as u8.
