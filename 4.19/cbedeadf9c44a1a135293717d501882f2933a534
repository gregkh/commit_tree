cifs: use 64-bit timestamps for fscache

In the fscache, we just need the timestamps as cookies to check for
changes, so we don't really care about the overflow, but it's better
to stop using the deprecated timespec so we don't have to go through
explicit conversion functions.

To avoid comparing uninitialized padding values that are copied
while assigning the timespec values, this rearranges the members of
cifs_fscache_inode_auxdata to avoid padding, and assigns them
individually.
