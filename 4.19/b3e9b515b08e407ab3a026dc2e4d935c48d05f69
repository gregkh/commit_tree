iommu/amd: Clear memory encryption mask from physical address

Boris Ostrovsky reported a memory leak with device passthrough when SME
is active.

The VFIO driver uses iommu_iova_to_phys() to get the physical address for
an iova. This physical address is later passed into vfio_unmap_unpin() to
unpin the memory. The vfio_unmap_unpin() uses pfn_valid() before unpinning
the memory. The pfn_valid() check was failing because encryption mask was
part of the physical address returned. This resulted in the memory not
being unpinned and therefore leaked after the guest terminates.

The memory encryption mask must be cleared from the physical address in
iommu_iova_to_phys().
