mtd: rawnand: qcom: wait for desc completion in all BAM channels

The BAM has 3 channels - tx, rx and command. command channel
is used for register read/writes, tx channel for data writes
and rx channel for data reads. Currently, the driver assumes the
transfer completion once it gets all the command descriptors
completed. Sometimes, there is race condition between data channel
(tx/rx) and command channel completion. In these cases,
the data present in buffer is not valid during small window
between command descriptor completion and data descriptor
completion.

This patch generates NAND transfer completion when both
(Data and Command) DMA channels have completed all its DMA
descriptors. It assigns completion callback in last
DMA descriptors of that channel and wait for completion.
