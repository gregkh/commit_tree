powerpc/powernv/npu: Add a debugfs setting to change ATSD threshold

The threshold at which it becomes more efficient to coalesce a range
of ATSDs into a single per-PID ATSD is currently not well understood
due to a lack of real-world work loads. This patch adds a debugfs
parameter allowing the threshold to be altered at runtime in order to
aid future development and refinement of the value.
