drm/powerplay: enable dpm under pass-through

Repeat enable dpm under pass-through because there is no actually
hardware-fini and real power-off when guest vm shutdown or reboot.
Otherwise, under pass-through it will be failed to populate populate
and upload SCLK MCLK DPM levels due to zero of pcie_speed_table.count.
