KVM: x86: Merge EMULTYPE_RETRY and EMULTYPE_ALLOW_REEXECUTE

retry_instruction() and reexecute_instruction() are a package deal,
i.e. there is no scenario where one is allowed and the other is not.
Merge their controlling emulation type flags to enforce this in code.
Name the combined flag EMULTYPE_ALLOW_RETRY to make it abundantly
clear that we are allowing re{try,execute} to occur, as opposed to
explicitly requesting retry of a previously failed instruction.
