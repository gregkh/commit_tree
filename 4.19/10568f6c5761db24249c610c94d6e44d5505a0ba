netfilter: xt_checksum: ignore gso skbs

Satish Patel reports a skb_warn_bad_offload() splat caused
by -j CHECKSUM rules:

-A POSTROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --sport 80 -j CHECKSUM

The CHECKSUM target has never worked with GSO skbs, and the above rule
makes no sense as kernel will handle checksum updates on transmit.

Unfortunately, there are 3rd party tools that install such rules, so we
cannot reject this from the config plane without potential breakage.

Amend Kconfig text to clarify that the CHECKSUM target is only useful
in virtualized environments, where old dhcp clients that use AF_PACKET
used to discard UDP packets with a 'bad' header checksum and add a
one-time warning in case such rule isn't restricted to UDP.
