x86/intel_rdt: Add check to determine if monitoring in progress

When a resource group is pseudo-locked it is orphaned without a class of
service associated with it. We thus do not want any monitoring in progress
on a resource group that will be used for pseudo-locking.

Introduce a test that can be used to determine if pseudo-locking in
progress on a resource group. Temporarily mark it as unused to avoid
compile warnings until it is used.
