uprobes: Use synchronize_rcu() not synchronize_sched()

While debugging another bug, I was looking at all the synchronize*()
functions being used in kernel/trace, and noticed that trace_uprobes was
using synchronize_sched(), with a comment to synchronize with
{u,ret}_probe_trace_func(). When looking at those functions, the data is
protected with "rcu_read_lock()" and not with "rcu_read_lock_sched()". This
is using the wrong synchronize_*() function.
