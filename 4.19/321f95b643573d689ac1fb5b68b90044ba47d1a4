MIPS: boot: do not include $(cpp_flags) for preprocessing ITS

$(CPP) is used here to perform macro replacement in ITS.  Do not
pass $(cpp_flags) because it pulls in more options for dependency
file generation etc. but none of which is necessary here.  ITS files
do not include any header file, so $(call if_change,...) is enough.
