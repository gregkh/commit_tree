net: mvpp2: Extract the correct ethtype from the skb for tx csum offload

When offloading the L3 and L4 csum computation on TX, we need to extract
the l3_proto from the ethtype, independently of the presence of a vlan
tag.

The actual driver uses skb->protocol as-is, resulting in packets with
the wrong L4 checksum being sent when there's a vlan tag in the packet
header and checksum offloading is enabled.

This commit makes use of vlan_protocol_get() to get the correct ethtype
regardless the presence of a vlan tag.
