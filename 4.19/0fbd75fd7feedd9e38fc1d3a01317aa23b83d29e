get_maintainer: allow option --mpath <directory> to read all files in <directory>

There is an external use case for multiple private MAINTAINER style files
in a separate directory.  Allow it.

--mpath has a default of "./MAINTAINERS".

The value entered can be either a file or a directory.

The behaviors are now:

--mpath <file>          Read only the specific file as <MAINTAINER_TYPE> file
--mpath <directory>     Read all files in <directory> as <MAINTAINER_TYPE> files
--mpath <directory> --find-maintainer-files
                        Recurse through <directory> and read all files named MAINTAINERS
