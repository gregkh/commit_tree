staging: add driver for Xilinx AXI-Stream FIFO v4.1 IP core

This IP core has read and write AXI-Stream FIFOs, the contents of which can
be accessed from the AXI4 memory-mapped interface. This is useful for
transferring data from a processor into the FPGA fabric. The driver creates
a character device that can be read/written to with standard
open/read/write/close.

See Xilinx PG080 document for IP details.

The driver currently supports only store-forward mode with a 32-bit
AXI4 Lite interface. DOES NOT support:
        - cut-through mode
        - AXI4 (non-lite)
