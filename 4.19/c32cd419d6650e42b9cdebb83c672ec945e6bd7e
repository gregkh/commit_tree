ARM: signal: copy registers using __copy_from_user()

__get_user_error() is used as a fast accessor to make copying structure
members in the signal handling path as efficient as possible.  However,
with software PAN and the recent Spectre variant 1, the efficiency is
reduced as these are no longer fast accessors.

In the case of software PAN, it has to switch the domain register around
each access, and with Spectre variant 1, it would have to repeat the
access_ok() check for each access.

It becomes much more efficient to use __copy_from_user() instead, so
let's use this for the ARM integer registers.
