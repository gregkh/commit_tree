net/sched: flower: Fix null pointer dereference when run tc vlan command

Zahari issued tc vlan command without setting vlan_ethtype, which will
crash kernel. To avoid this, we must check tb[TCA_FLOWER_KEY_VLAN_ETH_TYPE]
is not null before use it.
Also we don't need to dump vlan_ethtype or cvlan_ethtype in this case.
