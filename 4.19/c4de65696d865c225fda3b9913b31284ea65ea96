cpu/hotplug: Make bringup/teardown of smp threads symmetric

The asymmetry caused a warning to trigger if the bootup was stopped in state
CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_IDLE. The warning no longer triggers as kthread_park() can
now be invoked on already or still parked threads. But there is still no
reason to have this be asymmetric.
