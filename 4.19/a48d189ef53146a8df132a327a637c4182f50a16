net: Move skb decrypted field, avoid explicity copy

Commit 784abe24c903 ("net: Add decrypted field to skb")
introduced a 'decrypted' field that is explicitly copied on skb
copy and clone.

Move it between headers_start[0] and headers_end[0], so that we
don't need to copy it explicitly as it's copied by the memcpy()
in __copy_skb_header().

While at it, drop the assignment in __skb_clone(), it was
already redundant.

This doesn't change the size of sk_buff or cacheline boundaries.

The 15-bits hole before tc_index becomes a 14-bits hole, and
will be again a 15-bits hole when this change is merged with
commit 8b7008620b84 ("net: Don't copy pfmemalloc flag in
__copy_skb_header()").

v2: as reported by kbuild test robot (oops, I forgot to build
    with CONFIG_TLS_DEVICE it seems), we can't use
    CHECK_SKB_FIELD() on a bit-field member. Just drop the
    check for the moment being, perhaps we could think of some
    magic to also check bit-field members one day.
