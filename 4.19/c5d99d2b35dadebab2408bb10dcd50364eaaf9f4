ieee802154: hwsim: fix rcu address annotation

This patch fixes the following sparse warning about mismatch rcu
attribute for address space annotation:

...
error: incompatible types in comparison expression (different modifiers)
error: incompatible types in comparison expression (different address spaces)
...

Some __rcu annotation was at non-pointers list head structures and one was
missing in edge information which is used by rcu_assign_pointer() to
update edge setting information.
