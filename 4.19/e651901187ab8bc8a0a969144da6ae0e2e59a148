x86/intel_rdt: Introduce "bit_usage" to display cache allocations details

With cache regions now explicitly marked as "shareable" or "exclusive"
we would like to communicate to the user how portions of the cache
are used.

Introduce "bit_usage" that indicates for each resource
how portions of the cache are configured to be used.

To assist the user to distinguish whether the sharing is from software or
hardware we add the following annotation:

0 - currently unused
X - currently available for sharing and used by software and hardware
H - currently used by hardware only but available for software use
S - currently used and shareable by software only
E - currently used exclusively by one resource group
