nfp: don't fail probe on pci_sriov_set_totalvfs() errors

On machines with buggy ACPI tables or when SR-IOV is already enabled
we may not be able to set the SR-IOV VF limit in sysfs, it's not fatal
because the limit is imposed by the driver anyway.  Only the sysfs
'sriov_totalvfs' attribute will be too high.  Print an error to inform
user about the failure but allow probe to continue.
