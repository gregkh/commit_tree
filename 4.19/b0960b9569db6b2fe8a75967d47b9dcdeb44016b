KVM: arm: Add 32bit get/set events support

arm64's new use of KVMs get_events/set_events API calls isn't just
or RAS, it allows an SError that has been made pending by KVM as
part of its device emulation to be migrated.

Wire this up for 32bit too.

We only need to read/write the HCR_VA bit, and check that no esr has
been provided, as we don't yet support VDFSR.
