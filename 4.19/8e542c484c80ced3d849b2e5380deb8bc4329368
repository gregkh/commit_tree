staging:rtl8192u: Rename union QOS_TSINFO - Style

The union QOS_TSINFO, as a type, should have a lowercase name. The
union has therefore been renamed to qos_tsinfo. Additionally the
'typedef' directive has been removed to clear the checkpatch issue
with defining new types.

These are coding style changes which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
