netfilter: nf_conntrack: resolve clash for matching conntracks

This patch enables the clash resolution for NAT (disabled in
"590b52e10d41") if clashing conntracks match (i.e. both tuples are equal)
and a protocol allows it.

The clash might happen for a connections-less protocol (e.g. UDP) when
two threads in parallel writes to the same socket and consequent calls
to "get_unique_tuple" return the same tuples (incl. reply tuples).

In this case it is safe to perform the resolution, as the losing CT
describes the same mangling as the winning CT, so no modifications to
the packet are needed, and the result of rules traversal for the loser's
packet stays valid.
