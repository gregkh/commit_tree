microblaze/PCI: Remove stale pcibios_align_resource() comment

commit 01cf9d524ff0 ("microblaze/PCI: Support generic Xilinx AXI PCIe Host
Bridge IP driver")

and

commit ecf677c8dcaa ("PCI: Add a generic weak pcibios_align_resource()")

first patched then removed pcibios_align_resource() from the microblaze
architecture code but failed to remove the comment that was added to
it.

Remove it since it has now become stale and it is quite confusing.
