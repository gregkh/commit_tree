drm/msm/gpu: avoid deprecated do_gettimeofday

All users of do_gettimeofday() have been removed, but this one recently
crept in, along with an incorrect printing of the microseconds portion.

This converts it to using ktime_get_real_timespec64() as a direct
replacement, and adds the leading zeroes. I considered using monotonic
times (ktime_get()) instead, but as this timestamp appears to only
be used for humans rather than compared with other timestamps, the
real time domain is probably good enough.
