xfs: rename xfs_trans ->t_agfl_dfops to ->t_dfops

The ->t_agfl_dfops field is currently used to defer agfl block frees
from associated transaction contexts. While all known problematic
contexts have already been updated to use ->t_agfl_dfops, the
broader goal is defer agfl frees from all callers that already use a
deferred operations structure. Further, the transaction field
facilitates a good amount of code clean up where the transaction and
dfops have historically been passed down through the stack
separately.

Rename the field to something more generic to prepare to use it as
such throughout XFS. This patch does not change behavior.
