drm: Stop updating plane->crtc/fb/old_fb on atomic drivers

Stop playing around with plane->crtc/fb/old_fb with atomic
drivers. Make life a lot simpler when we don't have to do the
magic old_fb vs. fb dance around plane updates. That way we
can't risk plane->fb getting out of sync with plane->state->fb
and we're less likely to leak any refcounts as well.
