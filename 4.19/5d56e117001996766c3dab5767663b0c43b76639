fpga: dfl: add dfl_fpga_cdev_find_port

For feature devices, we need a method to find the port dedicated
to the device. This patch adds a function dfl_fpga_cdev_find_port
for this purpose. e.g. FPGA Management Engine (FME) Partial
Reconfiguration sub feature, it uses this function to find
dedicated port on the device for PR function implementation.
