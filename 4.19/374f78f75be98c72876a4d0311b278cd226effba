ixgbe: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL

ixgbe_fcoe_ddp_setup(), ixgbe_setup_fcoe_ddp_resources() and
ixgbe_sw_init() are never called in atomic context.
They call kmalloc(), dma_pool_alloc() and kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which is not necessary.
GFP_ATOMIC can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
