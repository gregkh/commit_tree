PCI: pciehp: Resume to D0 on enable/disable

pciehp's IRQ thread ensures accessibility of the port by runtime resuming
its parent to D0.  However when the slot is enabled/disabled, the port
itself needs to be in D0 because its secondary bus is accessed in:

    pciehp_check_link_status(),
    pciehp_configure_device() (both called from board_added())
and
    pciehp_unconfigure_device() (called from remove_board()).

Thus, acquire a runtime PM ref on enable/disablement of the slot.

Yinghai Lu additionally discovered that some SkyLake servers feature a
Power Controller for their PCIe hotplug ports (PCIe r3.1, sec 6.7.1.8)
which requires the port to be in D0 when invoking

    pciehp_power_on_slot() (likewise called from board_added()).

If slot power is turned on while in D3hot, link training later fails:
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20170205073454.GA253@wunner.de

The spec is silent about such a requirement, but it seems prudent to
assume that any hotplug port with a Power Controller may need this.

The present commit holds a runtime PM ref whenever slot power is turned
on and off, but it doesn't keep the port in D0 as long as slot power is
on.  If vendors determine that's necessary, they need to amend pciehp to
acquire a runtime PM ref in pciehp_power_on_slot() and release one in
pciehp_power_off_slot().
