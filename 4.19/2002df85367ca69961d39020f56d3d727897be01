ovl: Add helper ovl_already_copied_up()

There are couple of places where we need to know if file is already copied
up (in lockless manner).  Right now its open coded and there are only two
conditions to check.  Soon this patch series will introduce another
condition to check and Amir wants to introduce one more.  So introduce a
helper instead to check this so that code is easier to read.
