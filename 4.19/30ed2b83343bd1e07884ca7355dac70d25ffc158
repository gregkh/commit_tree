media: s3c-camif: ignore -ENOIOCTLCMD from v4l2_subdev_call for s_power

When the subdevice doesn't provide s_power core ops callback, the
v4l2_subdev_call for s_power returns -ENOIOCTLCMD.  If the subdevice
doesn't have the special handling for its power saving mode, the s_power
isn't required.  So -ENOIOCTLCMD from the v4l2_subdev_call should be
ignored.
