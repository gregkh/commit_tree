perf tests: Add breakpoint modify tests

Adding to tests that aims on kernel breakpoint modification bugs.

First test creates HW breakpoint, tries to change it and checks it was
properly changed. It aims on kernel issue that prevents HW breakpoint to
be changed via ptrace interface.

The first test forks, the child sets itself as ptrace tracee and waits
in signal for parent to trace it, then it calls bp_1 and quits.

The parent does following steps:

 - creates a new breakpoint (id 0) for bp_2 function
 - changes that breakpoint to bp_1 function
 - waits for the breakpoint to hit and checks
   it has proper rip of bp_1 function

This test aims on an issue in kernel preventing to change disabled
breakpoints

Second test mimics the first one except for few steps
in the parent:
 - creates a new breakpoint (id 0) for bp_1 function
 - changes that breakpoint to bogus (-1) address
 - waits for the breakpoint to hit and checks
   it has proper rip of bp_1 function

This test aims on an issue in kernel disabling enabled
breakpoint after unsuccesful change.
