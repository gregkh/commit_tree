ext4: sysfs: print ext4_super_block fields as little-endian

While working on extended rand for last_error/first_error timestamps,
I noticed that the endianess is wrong; we access the little-endian
fields in struct ext4_super_block as native-endian when we print them.

This adds a special case in ext4_attr_show() and ext4_attr_store()
to byteswap the superblock fields if needed.

In older kernels, this code was part of super.c, it got moved to
sysfs.c in linux-4.4.
