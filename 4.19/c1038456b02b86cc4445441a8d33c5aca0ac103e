drivers: qcom: rpmh: add RPMH helper functions

Sending RPMH requests and waiting for response from the controller
through a callback is common functionality across all platform drivers.
To simplify drivers, add a library functions to create RPMH client and
send resource state requests.

rpmh_write() is a synchronous blocking call that can be used to send
active state requests.
