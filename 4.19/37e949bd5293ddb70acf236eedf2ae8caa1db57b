proc/kcore: clean up ELF header generation

Currently, the ELF file header, program headers, and note segment are
allocated all at once, in some icky code dating back to 2.3.  Programs
tend to read the file header, then the program headers, then the note
segment, all separately, so this is a waste of effort.  It's cleaner and
more efficient to handle the three separately.
