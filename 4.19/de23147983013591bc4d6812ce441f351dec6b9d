ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Fix IN1 map headsetmic mapping

The initial bytcr_rt5651 machine driver commit mapped IN2 as the headset
mic. In retrospect this is not correct as all known boards have the headset
mic on IN3. To workaround this special IN?_HS_IN3 mappings were added.

This commit fixes the original IN1 mapping to correctly have the headset
mic on IN3, moves all users of the IN1_HS_IN3 mapping over to the fixed
IN1_MAP and drops the now no longer needed IN1_HS_IN3 mapping.
