mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Make global TCAM resources available to regions

Each TCAM region currently uses its own resources and there is no
sharing between the different regions.

This is going to change with A-TCAM as each region will need to allocate
an eRP table from the global eRP tables array.

Make the global TCAM resources available to each region by passing the
TCAM private data to the region initialization routine.
