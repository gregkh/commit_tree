arm64: kill change_cpacr()

Now that we have sysreg_clear_set(), we can use this instead of
change_cpacr().

Note that the order of the set and clear arguments differs between
change_cpacr() and sysreg_clear_set(), so these are flipped as part of
the conversion. Also, sve_user_enable() redundantly clears
CPACR_EL1_ZEN_EL0EN before setting it; this is removed for clarity.
