gnss: add generic serial driver

Add a generic serial GNSS driver (library) which provides a common
implementation for the gnss interface and power management (runtime and
system suspend). This allows GNSS drivers for specific chip to be
implemented by simply providing a set_power() callback to handle three
states: ACTIVE, STANDBY and OFF.
