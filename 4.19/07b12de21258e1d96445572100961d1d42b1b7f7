media: ddbridge/mci: store mci type and number of ports in the hwinfo

For better support for future MCI based cards, rename the mci struct
member to mci_ports to carry the number of ports on the cards, and add a
mci_type member to identify the card type to handle differing hardware.

Picked up from the upstream dddvb GIT.
