r8169: fix autoneg issue on resume with RTL8168E

It was reported that chip version 33 (RTL8168E) ends up with
10MBit/Half on a 1GBit link after resuming from S3 (with different
link partners). For whatever reason the PHY on this chip doesn't
properly start a renegotiation when soft-reset.
Explicitly requesting a renegotiation fixes this.
