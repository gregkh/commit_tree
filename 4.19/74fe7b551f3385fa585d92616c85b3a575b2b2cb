regmap: Add regmap_noinc_read API

The regmap API usually assumes that bulk read operations will read a
range of registers but some I2C/SPI devices have certain registers for
which a such a read operation will return data from an internal FIFO
instead. Add an explicit API to support bulk read without range semantics.

Some linux drivers use regmap_bulk_read or regmap_raw_read for such
registers, for example mpu6050 or bmi150 from IIO. This only happens to
work because when caching is disabled a single regmap read op will map
to a single bus read op (as desired). This breaks if caching is enabled and
reg+1 happens to be a cacheable register.

Without regmap support refactoring a driver to enable regmap caching
requires separate I2C and SPI paths. This is exactly what regmap is
supposed to help avoid.
