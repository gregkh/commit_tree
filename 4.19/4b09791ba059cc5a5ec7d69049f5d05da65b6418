cred: conditionally declare groups-related functions

The groups-related functions declared in include/linux/cred.h are
defined in kernel/groups.c, which is compiled only when
CONFIG_MULTIUSER=y. Move all these function declarations under #ifdef
CONFIG_MULTIUSER to help avoid accidental usage in contexts where
CONFIG_MULTIUSER might be disabled.

This patch also adds a fallback for groups_search(). Currently this
function is only called from kernel/groups.c itself and
security/keys/permissions.c, where the call is (by coincidence)
optimized away in case CONFIG_MULTIUSER=n. However, the audit subsystem
(which does not depend on CONFIG_MULTIUSER) calls this function in
-next, so the fallback will be needed to avoid compilation errors or
ugly workarounds.
