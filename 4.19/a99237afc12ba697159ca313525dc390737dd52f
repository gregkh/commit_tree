lib/fonts: convert comments to utf-8

The font files contain bit masks for characters in the cp437 character
set, and comments showing what character this is supposed to be.

This only makes sense when the terminal used to view the files is set to
the same codepage, but all other files in the kernel now use utf-8
encoding.

This changes those comments to utf-8 as well, for consistency.
