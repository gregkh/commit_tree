mm, swap: make CONFIG_THP_SWAP depend on CONFIG_SWAP

CONFIG_THP_SWAP should depend on CONFIG_SWAP, because it's unreasonable
to optimize swapping for THP (Transparent Huge Page) without basic
swapping support.

In original code, when CONFIG_SWAP=n and CONFIG_THP_SWAP=y,
split_swap_cluster() will not be built because it is in swapfile.c, but
it will be called in huge_memory.c.  This doesn't trigger a build error
in practice because the call site is enclosed by PageSwapCache(), which
is defined to be constant 0 when CONFIG_SWAP=n.  But this is fragile and
should be fixed.

The comments are fixed too to reflect the latest progress.
