drm/panel: simple: Add Sharp LQ035Q7DB03 panel support

The change adds support for Sharp LQ035Q7DB03 3.5" QVGA TFT panel.

Note that this aged panel is already found in the kernel sources,
for instance in board mach files mach-mx21ads.c, mach-mx27ads.c,
mach-pcm043.c, lpd270.c and imx27-phytec-phycore-rdk.dts.
