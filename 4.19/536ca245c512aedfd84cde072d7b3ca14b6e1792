IB/rxe: Drop QP0 silently

According to "Annex A16: RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)":

A16.4.3 MANAGEMENT INTERFACES

As defined in the base specification, a special Queue Pair, QP0 is defined
solely for communication between subnet manager(s) and subnet management
agents. Since such an IB-defined subnet management architecture is outside
the scope of this annex, it follows that there is also no requirement that
a port which conforms to this annex be associated with a QP0. Thus, for
end nodes designed to conform to this annex, the concept of QP0 is
undefined and unused for any port connected to an Ethernet network.

CA16-8: A packet arriving at a RoCE port containing a BTH with the
destination QP field set to QP0 shall be silently dropped.
