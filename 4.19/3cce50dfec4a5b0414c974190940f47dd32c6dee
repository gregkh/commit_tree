arm64: perf: Disable PMU while processing counter overflows

The arm64 PMU updates the event counters and reprograms the
counters in the overflow IRQ handler without disabling the
PMU. This could potentially cause skews in for group counters,
where the overflowed counters may potentially loose some event
counts, while they are reprogrammed. To prevent this, disable
the PMU while we process the counter overflows and enable it
right back when we are done.

This patch also moves the PMU stop/start routines to avoid a
forward declaration.
