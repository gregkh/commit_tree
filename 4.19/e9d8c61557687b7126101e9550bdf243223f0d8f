x86/mm/tlb: Skip atomic operations for 'init_mm' in switch_mm_irqs_off()

Song Liu noticed switch_mm_irqs_off() taking a lot of CPU time in recent
kernels,using 1.8% of a 48 CPU system during a netperf to localhost run.
Digging into the profile, we noticed that cpumask_clear_cpu and
cpumask_set_cpu together take about half of the CPU time taken by
switch_mm_irqs_off().

However, the CPUs running netperf end up switching back and forth
between netperf and the idle task, which does not require changes
to the mm_cpumask. Furthermore, the init_mm cpumask ends up being
the most heavily contended one in the system.

Simply skipping changes to mm_cpumask(&init_mm) reduces overhead.
