brcmfmac: define more bits for the flags of struct brcmf_sta_info_le

That struct is passed by a firmware when querying for STA info. Flags
are used to indicate what info could be obtained.

These new defines may allow passing more info to the cfg80211 in the
future. They had been obtained from Broadcom's SDK file wlioctl_defs.h
used by DD-WRT.
