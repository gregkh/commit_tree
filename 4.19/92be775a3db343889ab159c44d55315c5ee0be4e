mm: struct shrink_control: keep int fields together

Patch series "Reorderings in struct shrinker and struct shrink_control".

These structures are intensively used during reclaim and, displace other
data in cache, so there is no a reason they have int fields not grouped
together.

This patch (of 2):

gfp_t is of unsigned type, so let's move nid to keep them together.
