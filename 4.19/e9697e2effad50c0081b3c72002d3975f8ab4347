l2tp: ignore L2TP_ATTR_MTU

This attribute's handling is broken. It can only be used when creating
Ethernet pseudo-wires, in which case its value can be used as the
initial MTU for the l2tpeth device.
However, when handling update requests, L2TP_ATTR_MTU only modifies
session->mtu. This value is never propagated to the l2tpeth device.
Dump requests also return the value of session->mtu, which is not
synchronised anymore with the device MTU.

The same problem occurs if the device MTU is properly updated using the
generic IFLA_MTU attribute. In this case, session->mtu is not updated,
and L2TP_ATTR_MTU will report an invalid value again when dumping the
session.

It does not seem worthwhile to complexify l2tp_eth.c to synchronise
session->mtu with the device MTU. Even the ip-l2tp manpage advises to
use 'ip link' to initialise the MTU of l2tpeth devices (iproute2 does
not handle L2TP_ATTR_MTU at all anyway). So let's just ignore it
entirely.
