KVM: x86: Unexport x86_emulate_instruction()

Allowing x86_emulate_instruction() to be called directly has led to
subtle bugs being introduced, e.g. not setting EMULTYPE_NO_REEXECUTE
in the emulation type.  While most of the blame lies on re-execute
being opt-out, exporting x86_emulate_instruction() also exposes its
cr2 parameter, which may have contributed to commit d391f1207067
("x86/kvm/vmx: do not use vm-exit instruction length for fast MMIO
when running nested") using x86_emulate_instruction() instead of
emulate_instruction() because "hey, I have a cr2!", which in turn
introduced its EMULTYPE_NO_REEXECUTE bug.
