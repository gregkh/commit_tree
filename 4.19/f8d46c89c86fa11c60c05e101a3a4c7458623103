PCI/DPC: Leave interrupts enabled while handling event

Now that the DPC driver clears the interrupt status before exiting the
IRQ handler, we don't need to abuse the DPC control register to know if
a shared interrupt is for a new DPC event: a DPC port can not trigger
a second interrupt until the host clears the trigger status later in the
work queue handler.
