xhci: Fix use after free for URB cancellation on a reallocated endpoint

Make sure the cancelled URB is on the current endpoint ring.

If the endpoint ring has been reallocated since the URB was enqueued
then the URB may contain TD and TRB pointers to a already freed ring.
In this the case return the URB without touching any of the freed ring
structure data.

Don't try to stop the ring. It would be useless.

This can occur if endpoint is not flushed before it is dropped and
re-added, which is the case in usb_set_interface() as xhci does
things in an odd order.
