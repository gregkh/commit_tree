ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for Processing Units in UAC3

This patch adds support for the Processig Units defined in
the UAC3 spec. The main difference with the previous specs
is the lack of on/off switches in the controls for these
units and the addiction of the new Multi Function Processing
Unit.

The current version of the UAC3 spec doesn't define any
useful controls for the new Multi Function Processing Unit
so no control will get created once this unit is parsed.
