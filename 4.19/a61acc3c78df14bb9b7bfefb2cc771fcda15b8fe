xfs: use ->t_dfops in log recovery intent processing

xlog_finish_defer_ops() processes the deferred operations collected
over the entire intent recovery sequence. We can't xfs_defer_init()
here because the dfops is already populated. Attach it manually and
eliminate the last caller of xfs_defer_finish() that doesn't pass
->t_dfops.
