ip6_tunnel: collect_md xmit: Use ip_tunnel_key's provided src address

When using an ip6tnl device in collect_md mode, the xmit methods ignore
the ipv6.src field present in skb_tunnel_info's key, both for route
calculation purposes (flowi6 construction) and for assigning the
packet's final ipv6h->saddr.

This makes it impossible specifying a desired ipv6 local address in the
encapsulating header (for example, when using tc action tunnel_key).

This is also not aligned with behavior of ipip (ipv4) in collect_md
mode, where the key->u.ipv4.src gets used.

Fix, by assigning fl6.saddr with given key->u.ipv6.src.
In case ipv6.src is not specified, ip6_tnl_xmit uses existing saddr
selection code.
