bonding: fix warning message

RX queue config for bonding master could be different from its slave
device(s). With the commit 6a9e461f6fe4 ("bonding: pass link-local
packets to bonding master also."), the packet is reinjected into stack
with skb->dev as bonding master. This potentially triggers the
message:

   "bondX received packet on queue Y, but number of RX queues is Z"

whenever the queue that packet is received on is higher than the
numrxqueues on bonding master (Y > Z).

Fixes: 6a9e461f6fe4 ("bonding: pass link-local packets to bonding master also.")
