locking/refcount: Always allow checked forms

In many cases, it would be useful to be able to use the full
sanity-checked refcount helpers regardless of CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL,
as this would help to avoid duplicate warnings where callers try to
sanity-check refcount manipulation.

This patch refactors things such that the full refcount helpers were
always built, as refcount_${op}_checked(), such that they can be used
regardless of CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL. This will allow code which *always*
wants a checked refcount to opt-in, avoiding the need to duplicate the
logic for warnings.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
