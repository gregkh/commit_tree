md-cluster: clear another node's suspend_area after the copy is finished

When one node leaves cluster or stops the resyncing
(resync or recovery) array, then other nodes need to
call recover_bitmaps to continue the unfinished task.

But we need to clear suspend_area later after other
nodes copy the resync information to their bitmap
(by call bitmap_copy_from_slot). Otherwise, all nodes
could write to the suspend_area even the suspend_area
is not handled by any node, because area_resyncing
returns 0 at the beginning of raid1_write_request.
Which means one node could write suspend_area while
another node is resyncing the same area, then data
could be inconsistent.

So let's clear suspend_area later to avoid above issue
with the protection of bm lock. Also it is straightforward
to clear suspend_area after nodes have copied the resync
info to bitmap.
