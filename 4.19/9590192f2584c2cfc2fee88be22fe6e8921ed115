PCI: pciehp: Track enable/disable status

handle_button_press_event() currently determines whether the slot has
been turned on or off by looking at the Power Controller Control bit in
the Slot Control register.  This assumes that an attention button
implies presence of a power controller even though that's not mandated
by the spec.  Moreover the Power Controller Control bit is unreliable
when a power fault occurs (PCIe r4.0, sec 6.7.1.8).  This issue has
existed since the driver was introduced in 2004.

Fix by replacing STATIC_STATE with ON_STATE and OFF_STATE and tracking
whether the slot has been turned on or off.  This is also a required
ingredient to make pciehp resilient to missed events, which is the
object of an upcoming commit.
