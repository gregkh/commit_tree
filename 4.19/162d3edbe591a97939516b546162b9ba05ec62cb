perf trace: Beautify the AF_INET & AF_INET6 'socket' syscall 'protocol' args

For instance:

  $ trace -e socket* ssh sandy
     0.000 ( 0.031 ms): ssh/19919 socket(family: LOCAL, type: STREAM|CLOEXEC|NONBLOCK                   ) = 3
     0.052 ( 0.015 ms): ssh/19919 socket(family: LOCAL, type: STREAM|CLOEXEC|NONBLOCK                   ) = 3
     1.568 ( 0.020 ms): ssh/19919 socket(family: LOCAL, type: STREAM|CLOEXEC|NONBLOCK                   ) = 3
     1.603 ( 0.012 ms): ssh/19919 socket(family: LOCAL, type: STREAM|CLOEXEC|NONBLOCK                   ) = 3
     1.699 ( 0.014 ms): ssh/19919 socket(family: LOCAL, type: STREAM|CLOEXEC|NONBLOCK                   ) = 3
     1.724 ( 0.012 ms): ssh/19919 socket(family: LOCAL, type: STREAM|CLOEXEC|NONBLOCK                   ) = 3
     1.804 ( 0.020 ms): ssh/19919 socket(family: INET, type: STREAM, protocol: TCP                      ) = 3
    17.549 ( 0.098 ms): ssh/19919 socket(family: LOCAL, type: STREAM                                    ) = 4
  acme@sandy's password:

Just like with other syscall args, the common bits are supressed so that
the output is more compact, i.e. we use "TCP" instead of "IPPROTO_TCP",
but we can make this show the original constant names if we like it by
using some command line knob or ~/.perfconfig "[trace]" section
variable.

Also needed is to make perf's event parser accept things like:

  $ perf trace -e socket*/protocol=TCP/

By using both the tracefs event 'format' files and these tables built
from the kernel sources.
