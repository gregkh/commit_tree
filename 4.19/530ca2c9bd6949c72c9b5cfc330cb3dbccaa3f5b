blk-mq: Allow blocking queue tag iter callbacks

A recent commit runs tag iterator callbacks under the rcu read lock,
but existing callbacks do not satisfy the non-blocking requirement.
The commit intended to prevent an iterator from accessing a queue that's
being modified. This patch fixes the original issue by taking a queue
reference instead of reading it, which allows callbacks to make blocking
calls.
