arm64: KVM: Add support for Stage-2 control of memory types and cacheability

Up to ARMv8.3, the combinaison of Stage-1 and Stage-2 attributes
results in the strongest attribute of the two stages.  This means
that the hypervisor has to perform quite a lot of cache maintenance
just in case the guest has some non-cacheable mappings around.

ARMv8.4 solves this problem by offering a different mode (FWB) where
Stage-2 has total control over the memory attribute (this is limited
to systems where both I/O and instruction fetches are coherent with
the dcache). This is achieved by having a different set of memory
attributes in the page tables, and a new bit set in HCR_EL2.

On such a system, we can then safely sidestep any form of dcache
management.
