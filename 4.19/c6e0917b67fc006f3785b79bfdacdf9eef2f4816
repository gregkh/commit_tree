KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Permit uaccess writes to return errors

Currently we do not allow any vgic mmio write operations to fail, which
makes sense from mmio traps from the guest.  However, we should be able
to report failures to userspace, if userspace writes incompatible values
to read-only registers.  Rework the internal interface to allow errors
to be returned on the write side for userspace writes.
