serial: imx: fix comment about UCR2_SRST and its handling for shadowing

Initially when register shadowing was introduced (commit 3a0ab62f43de
("serial: imx: implement shadow registers for UCRx and UFCR")) the logic
to handle UCR2_SRST was wrong but documented consistently. Later the
handling was fixed, but the comment was not. This change makes up leeway
for the latter.
