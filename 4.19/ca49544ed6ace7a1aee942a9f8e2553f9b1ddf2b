mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Allow encoding a partial key

When working with 12 key blocks in the A-TCAM, rules are split into two
records, which constitute two lookups. The two records are linked using
a "large entry key ID". The ID is assigned to key blocks 6 to 11 and
resolved during the first lookup. The second lookup is performed using
the ID and the remaining key blocks.

Allow encoding a partial key so that it can be later used to check if an
ID can be reused.

This is done by adding two arguments to the existing encode function
that specify the range of the block indexes we would like to encode. The
key and mask arguments become optional, as we will not need to encode
both of them all the time.
