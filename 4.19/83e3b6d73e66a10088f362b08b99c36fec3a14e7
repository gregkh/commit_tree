perf tests: Fix record+probe_libc_inet_pton.sh to ensure cleanups

If there is a mismatch in the perf script output, this test fails and
exits before the event and temporary files created during its execution
are cleaned up.

This can be observed on a powerpc64 system running Fedora 27 as shown
below.

  # perf test -v "probe libc's inet_pton & backtrace it with ping"

  # perf probe --list

    probe_libc:inet_pton (on __inet_pton@resolv/inet_pton.c in /usr/lib64/power8/libc-2.26.so)

Cleanup of the event and the temporary files are now ensured by allowing
the cleanup code to be executed even if the lines from the backtrace do
not match their expected patterns instead of simply exiting from the
point of failure.
