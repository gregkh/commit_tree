time: Fix extra sleeptime injection when suspend fails

Currently, there exists a corner case assuming when there is
only one clocksource e.g RTC, and system failed to go to
suspend mode. While resume rtc_resume() injects the sleeptime
as timekeeping_rtc_skipresume() returned 'false' (default value
of sleeptime_injected) due to which we can see mismatch in
timestamps.

This issue can also come in a system where more than one
clocksource are present and very first suspend fails.

Success case:
------------
                                        {sleeptime_injected=false}
rtc_suspend() => timekeeping_suspend() => timekeeping_resume() =>

(sleeptime injected)
 rtc_resume()

Failure case:
------------
         {failure in sleep path} {sleeptime_injected=false}
rtc_suspend()     =>          rtc_resume()

{sleeptime injected again which was not required as the suspend failed}

Fix this by handling the boolean logic properly.
