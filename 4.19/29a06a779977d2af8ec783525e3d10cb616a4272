mlxsw: remove unused arrays mlxsw_i2c_driver_name and mlxsw_pci_driver_name

Arrays mlxsw_i2c_driver_name and mlxsw_pci_driver_name are defined
but never used hence they are redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: 'mlxsw_i2c_driver_name' defined but not used
warning: 'mlxsw_pci_driver_name' defined but not used
