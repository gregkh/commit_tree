serial: sh-sci: Improve support for separate TEI and DRI interrupts

Some SCIF versions mux error and break interrupts together and then provide
a separate interrupt ID for just TEI/DRI.

Allow all 6 types of interrupts to be specified via platform data (or DT)
and for any signals that are muxed together (have the same interrupt
number) simply register one handler.
