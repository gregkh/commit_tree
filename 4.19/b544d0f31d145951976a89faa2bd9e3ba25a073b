staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page d Bit Mask definitions - Style

Remove the unused 'page d' Bit Mask definitions. These definitions will
fail the checkpatch CamelCase naming test. Since the definitions are
unused in code they have been removed, rather then renaming.

This is a coding style change which should not impact runtime code
execution.
