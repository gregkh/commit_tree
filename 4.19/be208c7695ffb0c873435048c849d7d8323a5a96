staging:rtl8192u: Remove proxy rtl819XRadioA_Array - Style

The array rtl819XRadioA_Array serves as a proxy array for the actual
array Rtl8192UsbRadioA_Array. This implementation seems to serve no
other purpose then to obscure the actually array Rtl8192UsbRadioA_Array.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
