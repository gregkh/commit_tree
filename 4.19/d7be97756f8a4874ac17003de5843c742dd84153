net-sysfs: Drop support for XPS and traffic_class on single queue device

This patch makes it so that we do not report the traffic class or allow XPS
configuration on single queue devices. This is mostly to avoid unnecessary
complexity with changes I have planned that will allow us to reuse
the unused tc_to_txq and XPS configuration on a single queue device to
allow it to make use of a subset of queues on an underlying device.
