qed/qede: Multi CoS support.

This patch adds support for tc mqprio offload,
using this different traffic classes on the adapter
can be utilized based on configured priority to tc map.

For example -

tc qdisc add dev eth0 root mqprio num_tc 4 map 0 1 2 3

This will cause SKBs with priority 0,1,2,3 to transmit
over tc 0,1,2,3 hardware queues respectively.
