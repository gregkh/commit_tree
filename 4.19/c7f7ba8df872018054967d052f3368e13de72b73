net/mlx5e: Remove redundant WARN when we cannot find neigh entry

It is possible for neigh entry not to exist if it was cleaned already.
When we bring down an interface the neigh gets deleted but it could be
that our listener for neigh event to clear the encap valid bit didn't
start yet and the neigh update last used work is started first.
In this scenario the encap entry has valid bit set but the neigh entry
doesn't exist.
