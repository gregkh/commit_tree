crypto: drbg - eliminate constant reinitialization of SGL

The CTR DRBG requires two SGLs pointing to input/output buffers for the
CTR AES operation. The used SGLs always have only one entry. Thus, the
SGL can be initialized during allocation time, preventing a
re-initialization of the SGLs during each call.

The performance is increased by about 1 to 3 percent depending on the
size of the requested buffer size.
