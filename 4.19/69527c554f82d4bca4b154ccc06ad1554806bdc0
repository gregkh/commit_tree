now we can fold open_check_o_direct() into do_dentry_open()

These checks are better off in do_dentry_open(); the reason we couldn't
put them there used to be that callers couldn't tell what kind of cleanup
would do_dentry_open() failure call for.  Now that we have FMODE_OPENED,
cleanup is the same in all cases - it's simply fput().  So let's fold
that into do_dentry_open(), as Christoph's patch tried to.
