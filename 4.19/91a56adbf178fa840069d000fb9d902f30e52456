qede: Add destination ip based flow profile.

This patch adds support for dropping and redirecting
the flows based on destination IP in the packet.

This also moves the profile mode settings in their own
functions which can be used through tc flows in successive
patch.

For example -

ethtool -N p5p1 flow-type tcp4 dst-ip 192.168.40.100 action -1
ethtool -N p5p1 flow-type udp4 dst-ip 192.168.50.100 action 1
ethtool -N p5p1 flow-type tcp4 dst-ip 192.168.60.100 action 0x100000000
