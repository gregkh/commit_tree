xfs: remove last of unnecessary xfs_defer_cancel() callers

Now that deferred operations are completely managed via
transactions, it's no longer necessary to cancel the dfops in error
paths that already cancel the associated transaction. There are a
few such calls lingering throughout the codebase.

Remove all remaining unnecessary calls to xfs_defer_cancel(). This
leaves xfs_defer_cancel() calls in two places. The first is the call
in the transaction cancel path itself, which facilitates this patch.
The second is made via the xfs_defer_finish() error path to provide
consistent error semantics with transaction commit. For example,
xfs_trans_commit() expects an xfs_defer_finish() failure to clean up
the dfops structure before it returns.
