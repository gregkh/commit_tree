scsi: lpfc: Synchronize access to remoteport via rport

The driver currently uses the ndlp to get the local rport which is then used
to get the nvme transport remoteport pointer. There can be cases where a stale
remoteport pointer is obtained as synchronization isn't done through the
different dereferences.

Correct by using locks to synchronize the dereferences.
