scsi: snic: fix printing time intervals

We don't want to use 'struct timespec' because of the y2038 overflow
problem. The overflow is not actually an issue here, but it's easy to
replace with 'timespec64' for consistency. However, it's worth pointing out
that nanosecond values have nine digits, not eight or ten, so I'm fixing
the format strings accordingly as well.
