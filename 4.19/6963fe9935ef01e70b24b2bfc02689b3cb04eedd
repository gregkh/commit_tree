staging:rtl8192u: Rename CountryIeWatchdog > country_ie_watchdog - Style

Rename the member variable CountryIeWatchdog to country_ie_watchdog, this
change clears the checkpatch issue with CamelCase naming of variables.
The change is a simple coding style change which should not impact runtime
code execution.
