batman-adv: Prevent duplicated softif_vlan entry

The function batadv_softif_vlan_get is responsible for adding new
softif_vlan to the softif_vlan_list. It first checks whether the entry
already is in the list or not. If it is, then the creation of a new entry
is aborted.

But the lock for the list is only held when the list is really modified.
This could lead to duplicated entries because another context could create
an entry with the same key between the check and the list manipulation.

The check and the manipulation of the list must therefore be in the same
locked code section.
