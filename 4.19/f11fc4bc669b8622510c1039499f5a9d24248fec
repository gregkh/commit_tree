ACPI / LPSS: Force LPSS quirks on boot

Commit 12864ff8545f (ACPI / LPSS: Avoid PM quirks on suspend and resume
from hibernation) bypasses lpss quirks for S3 and S4, by setting a flag
for S3/S4 in acpi_lpss_suspend(), and check that flag in
acpi_lpss_resume().

But this overlooks the boot case where acpi_lpss_resume() may get called
without a corresponding acpi_lpss_suspend() having been called.

Thus force setting the flag during boot.
