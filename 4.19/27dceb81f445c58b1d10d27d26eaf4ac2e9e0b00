PM / Domains: Introduce dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name()

For the multiple PM domain case, let's introduce a new API called
dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name(). This allows a consumer driver to associate
its device with one of its PM domains, by using a name based lookup.

Do note that, currently it's only genpd that supports multiple PM domains
per device, but dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name() can easily by extended to
cover other PM domain types, if/when needed.
