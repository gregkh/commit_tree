libnvdimm, pmem: Restore page attributes when clearing errors

Use clear_mce_nospec() to restore WB mode for the kernel linear mapping
of a pmem page that was marked 'HWPoison'. A page with 'HWPoison' set
has also been marked UC in PAT (page attribute table) via
set_mce_nospec() to prevent speculative retrievals of poison.

The 'HWPoison' flag is only cleared when overwriting an entire page.
