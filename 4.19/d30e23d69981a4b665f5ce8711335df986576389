ASoC: hdmi-codec: fix routing

Commit 943fa0228252 ("ASoC: hdmi-codec: Use different name for playback
streams") broke hdmi-codec's routing between it's output "TX" widget
and the S/PDIF or I2S streams by renaming the streams.

Whether an error occurs or not is dependent on whether there is another
widget called "Playback" registered by some other component - if there
is, that widget will be (incorrectly) bound to the HDMI codec's "TX"
output widget.  If we end up connecting "TX" incorrectly, it can result
in components not being started, causing no audio output.

Since the I2S and S/PDIF streams now have different names, we can't
use a static route at component level to describe the relationship, so
arrange to dynamically create the route when the DAI driver is probed.
