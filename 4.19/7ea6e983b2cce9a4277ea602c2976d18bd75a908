perf tools: Make check-headers.sh check based on kernel dir

Changing the logic to compare files with paths relative to kernel source
base dir. This way we can keep the output message for 2 unrelated files,
which is coming in following patch.

Committer testing:

Remove a line from tools/arch/x86/lib/memcpy_64.S to have it detected:

make: Entering directory '/home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf'
  BUILD:   Doing 'make -j4' parallel build
Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/lib/memcpy_64.S' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/lib/memcpy_64.S'
diff -u tools/arch/x86/lib/memcpy_64.S arch/x86/lib/memcpy_64.S
  INSTALL  GTK UI
  INSTALL  binaries
