HID: redragon: fix num lock and caps lock LEDs

The redragon asura keyboard registers two input devices. The initial commit
85455dd906d5 ("HID: redragon: Fix modifier keys for Redragon Asura Keyboard")
considered this an error and prevented one of the devices from registering.
However, once this is done the num lock and caps lock leds no longer toggle on
and off, although the key functionality is not affected.

This commit removes the code that prevents the input device
registration and restores the num lock and caps lock LEDs.
