Documentation/bindings: crypto: inside-secure: update the compatibles

The compatibles were updated in the Inside Secure SafeXcel cryptographic
driver, as the ones previously used were not specific enough. The old
compatibles are still supported by the driver for backward
compatibility.

This patch updates the documentation accordingly.
