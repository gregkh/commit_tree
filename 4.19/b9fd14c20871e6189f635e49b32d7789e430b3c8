batman-adv: Fix segfault when writing to throughput_override

The per hardif sysfs file "batman_adv/throughput_override" prints the
resulting change as info text when the users writes to this file. It uses
the helper function batadv_info to add it at the same time to the kernel
ring buffer and to the batman-adv debug log (when CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG
is enabled).

The function batadv_info requires as first parameter the batman-adv softif
net_device. This parameter is then used to find the private buffer which
contains the debug log for this batman-adv interface. But
batadv_store_throughput_override used as first argument the slave
net_device. This slave device doesn't have the batadv_priv private data
which is access by batadv_info.

Writing to this file with CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG enabled can either lead
to a segfault or to memory corruption.
