drm/i915: Remove tasklet flush before disable

The idea was to try and let the existing tasklet run to completion
before we began the reset, but it involves a racy check against anything
else that tries to run the tasklet. Rather than acknowledge and ignore
the race, let it be and don't try and be too clever.

The tasklet will resume execution after reset (after spinning a bit
during reset), but before we allow it to resume we will have cleared all
the pending state.
