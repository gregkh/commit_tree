sound: don't call skl_init_chip() to reset intel skl soc

Internally, skl_init_chip() calls snd_hdac_bus_init_chip() which
1) sets bus->chip_init to prevent multiple entrances before device
is stopped; 2) enables interrupt.

We shouldn't use it for the purpose of resetting device only because
1) when we really want to initialize device, we won't be able to do
so; 2) we are ready to handle interrupt yet, and kernel crashes when
interrupt comes in.

Rename azx_reset() to snd_hdac_bus_reset_link(), and use it to reset
device properly.
