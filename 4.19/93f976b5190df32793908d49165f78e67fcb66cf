lib/rhashtable: simplify bucket_table_alloc()

As of ce91f6ee5b3b ("mm: kvmalloc does not fallback to vmalloc for
incompatible gfp flags") we can simplify the caller and trust kvzalloc()
to just do the right thing.  For the case of the GFP_ATOMIC context, we
can drop the __GFP_NORETRY flag for obvious reasons, and for the
__GFP_NOWARN case, however, it is changed such that the caller passes the
flag instead of making bucket_table_alloc() handle it.

This slightly changes the gfp flags passed on to nested_table_alloc() as
it will now also use GFP_ATOMIC | __GFP_NOWARN.  However, I consider this
a positive consequence as for the same reasons we want nowarn semantics in
bucket_table_alloc().
