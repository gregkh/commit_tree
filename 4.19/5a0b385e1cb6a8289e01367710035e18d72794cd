drm/i915: Nuke intel_trans_dp_port_sel()

for_each_encoder_on_crtc() is legacy and shouldn't be used by atomic
drivers. Let's throw out intel_trans_dp_port_sel() and replace it
with intel_get_crtc_new_encoder() which looks the atomic state instead.

Since we now have to call intel_get_crtc_new_encoder() during the commit
phase we'll need to plumb in the top level atomic state. The
crtc_state->state pointers are no longer valid at that point.
