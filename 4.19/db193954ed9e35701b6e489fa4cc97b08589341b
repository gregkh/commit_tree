block: bsg: move atomic_t ref_count variable to refcount API

Currently, variable ref_count within the bsg_device struct is of
type atomic_t.  For variables being used as reference counters,
the refcount API should be used instead of atomic.  The newer
refcount API works to prevent counter overflows and use-after-free
bugs.  So, move this varable from the atomic API to refcount,
potentially avoiding the issues mentioned.
