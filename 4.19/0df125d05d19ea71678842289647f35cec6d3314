net: phy: marvell: Replace mdelay() with msleep() in m88e1116r_config_init()

m88e1116r_config_init() is never called in atomic context.
It calls mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
