smb3: minor debugging clarifications in rfc1001 len processing

I ran into some cases where server was returning the wrong length
on frames but I couldn't easily match them to the command in the
network trace (or server logs) since I need the command and/or
multiplex id to find the offending SMB2/SMB3 command.  Add these
two fields to the log message. In the case of padding too much
it may not be a problem in all cases but might have correlated
to a network disconnect case in some problems we have been
looking at. In the case of frame too short is even more important.
