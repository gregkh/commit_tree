fsi: Add cfam char devices

This aims to deprecate the "raw" sysfs file used for directly
accessing the CFAM and instead use a char device like the
other sub drivers.

Since it reworks the slave creation code and adds a cfam device
type, we also use the opportunity to convert the attributes
to attribute groups and add a couple more.
