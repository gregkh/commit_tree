drivers/block/zram/zram_drv.c: fix bug storing backing_dev

The call to strlcpy in backing_dev_store is incorrect. It should take
the size of the destination buffer instead of the size of the source
buffer.  Additionally, ignore the newline character (\n) when reading
the new file_name buffer. This makes it possible to set the backing_dev
as follows:

	echo /dev/sdX > /sys/block/zram0/backing_dev

The reason it worked before was the fact that strlcpy() copies 'len - 1'
bytes, which is strlen(buf) - 1 in our case, so it accidentally didn't
copy the trailing new line symbol.  Which also means that "echo -n
/dev/sdX" most likely was broken.
