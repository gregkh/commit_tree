fsi/fsi-master-gpio: Sample input data on different clock phase

We currently sample the input data right after we toggle the
clock low, then high. The slave establishes the data on the
rising edge, so this is not ideal. We should sample it on
the low phase instead.

This currently works because we have an extra delay, but subsequent
patches will remove it.
