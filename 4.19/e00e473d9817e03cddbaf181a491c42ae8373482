drm/msm/gpu: Capture the state of the GPU

Add the infrastructure to capture the current state of the GPU and
store it in memory so that it can be dumped later.

For now grab the same basic ringbuffer information and registers
that are provided by the debugfs 'gpu' node but obviously this should
be extended to capture a much larger set of GPU information.
