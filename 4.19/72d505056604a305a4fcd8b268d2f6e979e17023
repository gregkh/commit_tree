x86/intel_rdt: Add utilities to test pseudo-locked region possibility

A pseudo-locked region does not have a class of service associated with
it and thus not tracked in the array of control values maintained as
part of the domain. Even so, when the user provides a new bitmask for
another resource group it needs to be checked for interference with
existing pseudo-locked regions.

Additionally only one pseudo-locked region can be created in any cache
hierarchy.

Introduce two utilities in support of above scenarios: (1) a utility
that can be used to test if a given capacity bitmask overlaps with any
pseudo-locked regions associated with a particular cache instance, (2) a
utility that can be used to test if a pseudo-locked region exists within
a particular cache hierarchy.
