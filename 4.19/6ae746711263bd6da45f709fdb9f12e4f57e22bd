hv_netvsc: Add per-cpu ethtool stats for netvsc

This patch implements following ethtool stats fields for netvsc:
cpu<n>_tx/rx_packets/bytes
cpu<n>_vf_tx/rx_packets/bytes

Corresponding per-cpu counters already exist in current code. Exposing
these counters will help troubleshooting performance issues.

for_each_present_cpu() was used instead of for_each_possible_cpu().
for_each_possible_cpu() would create very long and useless output.
It is still being used for internal buffer, but not for ethtool
output.

There could be an overflow if cpu was added between ethtool
call netvsc_get_sset_count() and netvsc_get_ethtool_stats() and
netvsc_get_strings(). (still safe if cpu was removed)
ethtool makes these three function calls separately.
As long as we use ethtool, I can't see any clean solution.

Currently and in foreseeable short term, Hyper-V doesn't support
cpu hot-plug. Plus, ethtool is for admin use. Unlikely the admin
would perform such combo operations.

Changes in v2:
  - Remove cpp style comment
  - Resubmit after freeze

Changes in v3:
  - Reimplemented with kvmalloc instead of alloc_percpu

Changes in v4:
  - Fixed inconsistent array size
  - Use kvmalloc_array instead of kvmalloc
