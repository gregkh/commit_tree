rcu: Make expedited GPs handle CPU 0 being offline

Currently, the parallelized initialization of expedited grace periods uses
the workqueue associated with each rcu_node structure's ->grplo field.
This works fine unless that CPU is offline.  This commit therefore uses
the CPU corresponding to the lowest-numbered online CPU, or just queues
the work on WORK_CPU_UNBOUND if there are no online CPUs corresponding
to this rcu_node structure.

Note that this patch uses cpu_is_offline() instead of the usual approach
of checking bits in the rcu_node structure's ->qsmaskinitnext field.  This
is safe because preemption is disabled across both the cpu_is_offline()
check and the call to queue_work_on().
