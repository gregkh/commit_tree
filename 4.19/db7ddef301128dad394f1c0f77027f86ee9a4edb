mm: move tlb_table_flush to tlb_flush_mmu_free

There is no need to call this from tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly, it logically
belongs with tlb_flush_mmu_free.  This makes future fixes simpler.

[ This was originally done to allow code consolidation for the
  mmu_notifier fix, but it also ends up helping simplify the
  HAVE_RCU_TABLE_INVALIDATE fix.    - Linus ]
