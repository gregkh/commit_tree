mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Encapsulate C-TCAM region in A-TCAM region

In Spectrum-2 the C-TCAM is only used for rules that can't fit in the
A-TCAM due to a limited number of masks per A-TCAM region.

In addition, rules inserted into the C-TCAM may affect rules residing in
the A-TCAM, by clearing their C-TCAM prune bit.

The two regions are thus closely related and can be thought of as if the
C-TCAM region is encapsulated in the A-TCAM one.

Change the data structures to reflect that before introducing A-TCAM
support and make C-TCAM region initialization part of the A-TCAM region
initialization sequence.
