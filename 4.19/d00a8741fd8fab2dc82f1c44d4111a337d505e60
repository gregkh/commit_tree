platform/chrome: Move cros-ec transport drivers to drivers/platform.

There are some cros-ec transport drivers (I2C, SPI) living in MFD, while
others (LPC) living in drivers/platform. The transport drivers are more
platform specific. So, move the I2C and SPI transport drivers to the
platform/chrome directory. The patch also removes the MFD_ prefix of
their Kconfig symbols.
