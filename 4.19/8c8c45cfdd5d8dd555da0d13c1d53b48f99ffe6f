checkpatch: fix macro argument reuse test

Multiple line macro definitions where the arguments are separated by line
continuations can cause checkpatch to emit invalid syntax regex tests.

This can occur when a single argument is modified in a part of a patch.

For example: (to not add a diff in the commit message)

$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --git db023296f0115d2fe01fdabad54678f2b806da23
Unterminated \g... pattern in regex; <very long regex omitted>

And, the test does not work correctly when these arguments are all new as
the initial patch line addition "+" is used in the argument name.

Fix this by stripping the line continuations and any "+" from the list of
arguments.
