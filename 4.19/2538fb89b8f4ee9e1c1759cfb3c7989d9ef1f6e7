PCI: Limit config space size for Netronome NFP5000

Like the NFP4000 and NFP6000, the NFP5000 as an erratum where reading/
writing to PCI config space addresses above 0x600 can cause the NFP to
generate PCIe completion timeouts.

Limit the NFP5000's PF's config space size to 0x600 bytes as is already
done for the NFP4000 and NFP6000.

The NFP5000's VF is 0x6003 (PCI_DEVICE_ID_NETRONOME_NFP6000_VF), the same
device ID as the NFP6000's VF.  Thus, its config space is already limited
by the existing use of quirk_nfp6000().
