scsi: lpfc: Correct LCB ACCept payload

After memory allocation for the LCB response frame, the memory wasn't zero
initialized, and not all fields are set. Thus garbage shows up in the
payload.

Fix by zeroing the memory at allocation.  Also properly set the Capability
field based on duration support.
