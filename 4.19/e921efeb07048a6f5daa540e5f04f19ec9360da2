bcache: make the pr_err statement used for ENOENT only in sysfs_attatch section

The pr_err statement in the code for sysfs_attatch section would run
for various error codes, which maybe confusing.

E.g,

Run the command twice:
   echo 796b5c05-b03c-4bc7-9cbd-a8df5e8be891 > \
				/sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach
   [the backing dev got attached on the first run]
   echo 796b5c05-b03c-4bc7-9cbd-a8df5e8be891 > \
				/sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach

In dmesg, after the command run twice, we can get:
	bcache: bch_cached_dev_attach() Can't attach sda6: already attached
	bcache: __cached_dev_store() Can't attach 796b5c05-b03c-4bc7-9cbd-\
a8df5e8be891
               : cache set not found
The first statement in the message was right, but the second was
confusing.

bch_cached_dev_attach has various pr_ statements for various error
codes, except ENOENT.

After the change, rerun above command twice:
	echo 796b5c05-b03c-4bc7-9cbd-a8df5e8be891 > \
			/sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach
	echo 796b5c05-b03c-4bc7-9cbd-a8df5e8be891 > \
			/sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach

In dmesg we only got:
	bcache: bch_cached_dev_attach() Can't attach sda6: already attached
No confusing "cache set not found" message anymore.

And for some not exist SET-UUID:
	echo 796b5c05-b03c-4bc7-9cbd-a8df5e8be898 > \
			/sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach
In dmesg we can get:
	bcache: __cached_dev_store() Can't attach 796b5c05-b03c-4bc7-9cbd-\
a8df5e8be898
	               : cache set not found
