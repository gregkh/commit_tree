RAID10 BUG_ON in raise_barrier when force is true and conf->barrier is 0

In raid10 reshape_request it gets max_sectors in read_balance. If the underlayer disks
have bad blocks, the max_sectors is less than last. It will call goto read_more many
times. It calls raise_barrier(conf, sectors_done != 0) every time. In this condition
sectors_done is not 0. So the value passed to the argument force of raise_barrier is
true.

In raise_barrier it checks conf->barrier when force is true. If force is true and
conf->barrier is 0, it panic. In this case reshape_request submits bio to under layer
disks. And in the callback function of the bio it calls lower_barrier. If the bio
finishes before calling raise_barrier again, it can trigger the BUG_ON.

Add one pair of raise_barrier/lower_barrier to fix this bug.
