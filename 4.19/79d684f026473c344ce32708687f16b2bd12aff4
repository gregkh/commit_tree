RDMA/core: Simplify gid type check in cma_acquire_dev()

cma_add_one() initializes the default GID regardless of device type.
listen_id is bound to a device and an IP address, its GID type is
initialized by cma_acquire_dev().

Therefore a valid default GID type is always available, it is not needed
to check port type during cma_acquire_dev().

Initialize gid type of a cm id when the cm_id is created instead of
doing conditional checks during cma_acquire_dev() and trying to
initialize to 0 during _cma_attach_to_dev().
