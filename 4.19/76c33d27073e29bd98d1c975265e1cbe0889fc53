dmaengine: imx-sdma: factor out a struct sdma_desc from struct sdma_channel

This is a preparation step to make the adding of virt-dma easier.
We create a struct sdma_desc, move some fields from struct sdma_channel
there and add a pointer from the former to the latter. For now we
allocate the data statically in struct sdma_channel, but with
virt-dma support it will be dynamically allocated.
