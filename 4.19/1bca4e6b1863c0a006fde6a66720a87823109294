samples/bpf: xdp_redirect_cpu load balance like Suricata

This implement XDP CPU redirection load-balancing across available
CPUs, based on the hashing IP-pairs + L4-protocol.  This equivalent to
xdp-cpu-redirect feature in Suricata, which is inspired by the
Suricata 'ippair' hashing code.

An important property is that the hashing is flow symmetric, meaning
that if the source and destination gets swapped then the selected CPU
will remain the same.  This is helps locality by placing both directions
of a flows on the same CPU, in a forwarding/routing scenario.

The hashing INITVAL (15485863 the 10^6th prime number) was fairly
arbitrary choosen, but experiments with kernel tree pktgen scripts
(pktgen_sample04_many_flows.sh +pktgen_sample05_flow_per_thread.sh)
showed this improved the distribution.

This patch also change the default loaded XDP program to be this
load-balancer.  As based on different user feedback, this seems to be
the expected behavior of the sample xdp_redirect_cpu.
