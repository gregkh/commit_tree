drm/amd/display: Add CRC support for DCN

[Why]
Regamma/CTM tests require CRC support

[How]
The CRC registers that were used in DCE exist under different
names in DCN.  The code was copied from DCE (in
dc/dce110/dce110_timing_generator.c) into DCN, and changed to
use the DCN register access helper functions.
