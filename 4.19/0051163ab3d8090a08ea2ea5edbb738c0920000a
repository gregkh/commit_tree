drm/i915/execlists: Always clear preempt status on cancelling all

On reset/wedging, we cancel all pending replies from the HW and we also
want to cancel an outstanding preemption event. Since we use the same
function to cancel the pending replies for reset and for a preemption
event, we can simply clear the active tracking for all.

v2: Keep execlists_user_end() markup for wedging
v3: Move assignment to inline to hide the bare assignment.
