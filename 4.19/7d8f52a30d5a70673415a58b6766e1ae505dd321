crypto: inside-secure - use precise compatibles

At first we used two compatibles in the SafeXcel driver, named after the
engine revision: eip97 and eip197. However this family of engines has
more precise versions and in fact we're supporting the eip97ies and
eip197b. More versions will be supported in the future, such as the
eip197d, and we'll need to differentiate them.

This patch fixes the compatibles used in the driver, to now use precise
ones. The two historical compatibles are kept for backward
compatibility.
