net/af_iucv: fix skb handling on HiperTransport xmit error

When sending an skb, afiucv_hs_send() bails out on various error
conditions. But currently the caller has no way of telling whether the
skb was freed or not - resulting in potentially either
a) leaked skbs from iucv_send_ctrl(), or
b) double-free's from iucv_sock_sendmsg().

As dev_queue_xmit() will always consume the skb (even on error), be
consistent and also free the skb from all other error paths. This way
callers no longer need to care about managing the skb.
