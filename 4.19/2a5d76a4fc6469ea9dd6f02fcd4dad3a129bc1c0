x86/intel_rdt: Utilities to restrict/restore access to specific files

In support of Cache Pseudo-Locking we need to restrict access to specific
resctrl files to protect the state of a resource group used for
pseudo-locking from being changed in unsupported ways.

Introduce two utilities that can be used to either restrict or restore the
access to all files irrelevant to cache pseudo-locking when pseudo-locking
in progress for the resource group.

At this time introduce a new source file, intel_rdt_pseudo_lock.c, that
will contain most of the code related to cache pseudo-locking.

Temporarily mark these new functions as unused to silence compile warnings
until they are used.
