module: use relative references for __ksymtab entries

An ordinary arm64 defconfig build has ~64 KB worth of __ksymtab entries,
each consisting of two 64-bit fields containing absolute references, to
the symbol itself and to a char array containing its name, respectively.

When we build the same configuration with KASLR enabled, we end up with an
additional ~192 KB of relocations in the .init section, i.e., one 24 byte
entry for each absolute reference, which all need to be processed at boot
time.

Given how the struct kernel_symbol that describes each entry is completely
local to module.c (except for the references emitted by EXPORT_SYMBOL()
itself), we can easily modify it to contain two 32-bit relative references
instead.  This reduces the size of the __ksymtab section by 50% for all
64-bit architectures, and gets rid of the runtime relocations entirely for
architectures implementing KASLR, either via standard PIE linking (arm64)
or using custom host tools (x86).

Note that the binary search involving __ksymtab contents relies on each
section being sorted by symbol name.  This is implemented based on the
input section names, not the names in the ksymtab entries, so this patch
does not interfere with that.

Given that the use of place-relative relocations requires support both in
the toolchain and in the module loader, we cannot enable this feature for
all architectures.  So make it dependent on whether
CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_PREL32_RELOCATIONS is defined.
