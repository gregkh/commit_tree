MIPS: remove mips_swiotlb_ops

mips_swiotlb_ops differs from the generic swiotlb_dma_ops only in that
it contains a mb() barrier after each operations that maps or syncs
dma memory to the device.

The dma operations are defined to not be memory barriers, but instead
the write* operations to kick the DMA off are supposed to contain them.

For mips this handled by war_io_reorder_wmb(), which evaluates to the
stronger wmb() instead of the pure compiler barrier barrier() for
just those platforms that use swiotlb, so I think we are covered
properly.

  - Include linux/swiotlb.h to fix build failures for configs with
    CONFIG_SWIOTLB=y.]
