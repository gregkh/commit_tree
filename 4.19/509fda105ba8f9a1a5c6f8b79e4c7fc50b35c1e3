samples/bpf: xdp_rxq_info action XDP_TX must adjust MAC-addrs

XDP_TX requires also changing the MAC-addrs, else some hardware
may drop the TX packet before reaching the wire.  This was
observed with driver mlx5.

If xdp_rxq_info select --action XDP_TX the swapmac functionality
is activated.  It is also possible to manually enable via cmdline
option --swapmac.  This is practical if wanting to measure the
overhead of writing/updating payload for other action types.
