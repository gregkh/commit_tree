drm/i915/selftests: Free the backing store between iterations

In the huge pages tests, we may have lots of objects being trapped on
the freelist as we hold the struct_mutex allowing the free worker no
opportunity to recover the backing store. We also have stricter
requirements and the desire for large contiguous pages, further
increasing the allocation pressure. To reduce the chance of running out
of memory, we could either drop the mutex and flush the free worker, or
we could release the backing store directly. We do the latter in this
patch for simplicity.
