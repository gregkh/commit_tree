staging: wilc1000: fix TODO to compile spi and sdio components in single module

Changes to compile module component along with SPI and SDIO module.
Previously 'wilc1000.ko' used to generate along with wilc-spi.ko or
wilc1000-sdio.ko module. After these changes only wilc1000-spi.ko or
wilc1000-sdio.ko modules are required for SPI and SDIO respectively.
These changes are done to address below TODO item.

- make SPI and SDIO components coexist in one build
