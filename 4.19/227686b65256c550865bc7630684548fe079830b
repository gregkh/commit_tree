staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Update default hash key

In our documentation, we claim to use a 5-tuple key for Rx hash
distribution of flows. The code however configures a key composed
of all supported header fields.

Update the Rx hash key to contain only the documented fields:
{IP src, IP dst, IP nextproto, L4 src, L4 dst}, which was the
original intention and makes most sense as a default.
