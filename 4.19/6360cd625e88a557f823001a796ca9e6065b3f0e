net/mlx5e: Use ttl from route lookup on tc encap offload only if needed

Currnetly, the ttl for the encapsulation headers is taken from the
route lookup result. As a pre-step to allow for an offload case when
the user specifies the ttl, take it from the route lookup only if
not zero. While here, also move to use u8 instead int for the ttl.
