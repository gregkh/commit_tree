arm64: drop alignment from syscall tables

Our syscall tables are aligned to 4096 bytes, which allowed their
addresses to be generated with a single adrp in entry.S. This has the
unfortunate property of wasting space in .rodata for the necessary
padding.

Now that the address is generated by C code, we can rely on the compiler
to do the right thing, and drop the alignemnt.
