NFS: Use an appropriate work queue for direct-write completion

When a direct-write completes, a work_struct is schedule to handle
the completion.
When NFS is being used for swap, the direct write might be a swap-out,
so memory allocation can block until the write completes.
The work queue currently used is not WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, so tasks
can block waiting for memory - this leads to deadlock.

So use nfsiod_workqueue instead.  This will always have a running
thread, and work items should never block waiting for memory.
