bcache: do not check return value of debugfs_create_dir()

Greg KH suggests that normal code should not care about debugfs. Therefore
no matter successful or failed of debugfs_create_dir() execution, it is
unncessary to check its return value.

There are two functions called debugfs_create_dir() and check the return
value, which are bch_debug_init() and closure_debug_init(). This patch
changes these two functions from int to void type, and ignore return values
of debugfs_create_dir().

This patch does not fix exact bug, just makes things work as they should.
