mm: check shrinker is memcg-aware in register_shrinker_prepared()

There is a sad BUG introduced in patch adding SHRINKER_REGISTERING.
shrinker_idr business is only for memcg-aware shrinkers.  Only such type
of shrinkers have id and they must be finaly installed via idr_replace()
in this function.  For !memcg-aware shrinkers we never initialize
shrinker->id field.

But there are all types of shrinkers passed to idr_replace(), and every
!memcg-aware shrinker with random ID (most probably, its id is 0)
replaces memcg-aware shrinker pointed by the ID in IDR.

This patch fixes the problem.
