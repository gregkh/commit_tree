reiserfs: remove obsolete print_time function

Before linux-2.4.6, print_time() was used to pretty-print an inode time
when running reiserfs in user space, after that it has become obsolete and
is still a bit incorrect: It behaves differently on 32-bit and 64-bit
machines, and uses a static buffer to hold a string, which could lead to
undefined behavior if we ever called this from multiple places
simultaneously.

Since we always want to treat the timestamps as 'unsigned' anyway, simply
printing them as an integer is both simpler and safer while avoiding the
deprecated time_t type.
