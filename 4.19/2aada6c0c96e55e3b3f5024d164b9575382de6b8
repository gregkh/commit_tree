net/mlx5: Add forward compatible support for the FTE match data

Use the PRM size including the reserved when working with the FTE
match data.

This comes to support forward compatibility for cases that current
reserved data will be exposed by the firmware by an application that
uses the DEVX API without changing the kernel.

Also drop some driver checks around the match criteria leaving the work
for firmware to enable forward compatibility for future bits there.
