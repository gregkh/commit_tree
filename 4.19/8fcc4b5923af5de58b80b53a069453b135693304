kvm: nVMX: Introduce KVM_CAP_NESTED_STATE

For nested virtualization L0 KVM is managing a bit of state for L2 guests,
this state can not be captured through the currently available IOCTLs. In
fact the state captured through all of these IOCTLs is usually a mix of L1
and L2 state. It is also dependent on whether the L2 guest was running at
the moment when the process was interrupted to save its state.

With this capability, there are two new vcpu ioctls: KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE
and KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE. These can be used for saving and restoring a VM
that is in VMX operation.
