ARM: dts: aspeed: Enable vhub on port A of AST2500 EVB

This is an eval board, it makes sense to enable many
functions by default. This changes the device-tree to
set port A to be a USB device and leave port B as a
host, along with a little comment explaining how to
change it.

(the vhub device can only exist on port A on this SoC)
