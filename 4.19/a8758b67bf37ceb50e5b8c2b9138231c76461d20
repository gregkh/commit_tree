mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Add A-TCAM rule insertion and deletion

Implement rule insertion and deletion into the A-TCAM before we flip the
driver to start using the A-TCAM.

Rule insertion into the A-TCAM is very similar to C-TCAM, but there are
subtle differences between regions of different sizes (i.e., different
number of key blocks).

Specifically, as explained in "mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Allow encoding a
partial key", in 12 key blocks regions a rule is split into two and the
two halves of the rule are linked using a "large entry key ID".

Such differences are abstracted away by using different region
operations per region type.
