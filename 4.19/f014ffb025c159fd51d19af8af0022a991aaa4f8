afs: Fix afs_server struct leak

Fix a leak of afs_server structs.  The routine that installs them in the
various lookup lists and trees gets a ref on leaving the function, whether
it added the server or a server already exists.  It shouldn't increment
the refcount if it added the server.

The effect of this that "rmmod kafs" will hang waiting for the leaked
server to become unused.
