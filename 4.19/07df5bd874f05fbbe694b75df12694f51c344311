r8169: power down chip in probe

The removed code would be called in two situations:
1. interface is brought up never or >10s after driver load
2. after close()

Case 1 we can handle cleaner by ensuring chip is powered down when
leaving probe(). open() callback will power up the chip.

In case 2 we call rtl_pll_power_down() twice currently, from the
close() callback and 10s later when entering runtime-suspend.
This is avoided by this patch.
