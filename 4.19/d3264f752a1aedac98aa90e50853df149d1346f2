cpufreq: intel_pstate: Ignore turbo active ratio in HWP

When HWP is active turbo active ratio is not used, so we should allow
policy max frequency above turbo activation ratio to be set. When HWP is
not active, then any policy max frequency above turbo activation ratio
can result upto max one-core turbo frequency.

This fix helps better thermal control in turbo region when other methods
like "Running Average Power Limit" is not available to use.
