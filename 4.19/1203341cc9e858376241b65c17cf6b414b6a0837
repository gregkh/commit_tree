net: mvpp2: debugfs: add hit counter stats for Header Parser entries

One helpful feature to help debug the Header Parser TCAM filter in PPv2
is to be able to see if the entries did match something when a packet
comes in. This can be done by using the built-in hit counter for TCAM
entries.

This commit implements reading the counter, and exposing its value on
debugfs for each filter entry.

The counter is a 16-bits clear-on-read value, located at:
 .../mvpp2/<controller>/parser/XXX/hits
