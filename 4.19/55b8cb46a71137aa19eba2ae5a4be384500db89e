ALSA: usb-audio: Tidy up logic for Processing Unit min/max values

This patch refactors the processing units min/max calculation logic
for the mixer controls and fixes an issue where the Mode Select
checking of the Up/Down mixers doesn't differentiate between the
UAC1 and UAC2 Control Selector (0x02) and the UAC3 one which is
different (0x01).
