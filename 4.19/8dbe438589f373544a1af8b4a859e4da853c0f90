x86/tsc: Make use of tsc_calibrate_cpu_early()

During early boot enable tsc_calibrate_cpu_early() and switch to
tsc_calibrate_cpu() only later. Do this unconditionally, because it is
unknown what methods other cpus will use to calibrate once they are
onlined.

If by the time tsc_init() is called tsc frequency is still unknown do only
pit_hpet_ptimer_calibrate_cpu() to calibrate, as this function contains the
only methods wich have not been called and tried earlier.
