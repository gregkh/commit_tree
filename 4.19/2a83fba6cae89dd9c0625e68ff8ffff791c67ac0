igb: Remove superfluous reset to PHY and page 0 selection

This patch reverts two previous applied patches to fix an issue
that appeared when using SGMII based SFP modules. In the current
state the driver will try to reset the PHY before obtaining the
phy_addr of the SGMII attached PHY. That leads to an error in
e1000_write_phy_reg_sgmii_82575. Causing the initialization to
fail:

    igb: Intel(R) Gigabit Ethernet Network Driver - version 5.4.0-k
    igb: Copyright (c) 2007-2014 Intel Corporation.
    igb: probe of ????:??:??.? failed with error -3

The patches being reverted are:

        igb: reset the PHY before reading the PHY ID

    commit 440aeca4b9858248d8f16d724d9fa87a4f65fa33

         igb: Explicitly select page 0 at initialization

The first reverted patch directly causes the problem mentioned above.
In case of SGMII the phy_addr is not known at this point and will
only be obtained by 'igb_get_phy_id_82575' further down in the code.
The second removed patch selects forces selection of page 0 in the
PHY. Something that the reset tries to address as well.

As pointed out by Alexander Duzck, the patch below fixes the same
issue but in the proper location:
