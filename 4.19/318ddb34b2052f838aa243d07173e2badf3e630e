scsi: ipr: System hung while dlpar adding primary ipr adapter back

While dlpar adding primary ipr adapter back, driver goes through adapter
initialization then schedule ipr_worker_thread to start te disk scan by
dropping the host lock, calling scsi_add_device.  Then get the adapter reset
request again, so driver does scsi_block_requests, this will cause the
scsi_add_device get hung until we unblock. But we can't run ipr_worker_thread
to do the unblock because its stuck in scsi_add_device.

This patch fixes the issue.
