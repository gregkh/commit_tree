net sched actions: fix sparse warning

The variable _data in include/asm-generic/sections.h defines sections,
this causes sparse warning in pedit:

net/sched/act_pedit.c:293:35: warning: symbol '_data' shadows an earlier one
./include/asm-generic/sections.h:36:13: originally declared here

Therefore rename the variable.
