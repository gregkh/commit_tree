block: make bdev_ops->rw_page() take a REQ_OP instead of bool

c11f0c0b5bb9 ("block/mm: make bdev_ops->rw_page() take a bool for
read/write") replaced @op with boolean @is_write, which limited the
amount of information going into ->rw_page() and more importantly
page_endio(), which removed the need to expose block internals to mm.

Unfortunately, we want to track discards separately and @is_write
isn't enough information.  This patch updates bdev_ops->rw_page() to
take REQ_OP instead but leaves page_endio() to take bool @is_write.
This allows the block part of operations to have enough information
while not leaking it to mm.
