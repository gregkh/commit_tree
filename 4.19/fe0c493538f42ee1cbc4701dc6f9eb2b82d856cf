drm/i915/execlists: Handle copying default context state for atomic reset

We want to be able to reset the GPU from inside a timer callback
(hardirq context). One step requires us to copy the default context
state over to the guilty context, which means we need to plan in advance
to have that object accessible from within an atomic context. The atomic
context prevents us from pinning the object or from peeking into the
shmemfs backing store (all may sleep), so we choose to pin the
default_state into memory when the engine becomes active. This
compromise allows us to swap out the default state when idle, when
required.
