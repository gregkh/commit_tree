crypto: skcipher - remove useless setting of type flags

Some skcipher algorithms set .cra_flags = CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_SKCIPHER.  But
this is redundant with the C structure type ('struct skcipher_alg'), and
crypto_register_skcipher() already sets the type flag automatically,
clearing any type flag that was already there.  Apparently the useless
assignment has just been copy+pasted around.

So, remove the useless assignment from all the skcipher algorithms.

This patch shouldn't change any actual behavior.
