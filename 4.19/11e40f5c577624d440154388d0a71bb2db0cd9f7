vmw_pvrdma: Release netdev when vmxnet3 module is removed

On repeated module load/unload cycles, its possible for the pvrmda driver
to encounter this crash:

This occurs because vmw_pvrdma on probe stores a pointer to the netdev
that exists on function 0 of the same bus/device/slot (which represents
the vmxnet3 ethernet driver).  However, it never removes this pointer if
the vmxnet3 module is removed, leading to crashes resulting from use after
free dereferencing incidents like the one above.

The fix is pretty straightforward.  vmw_pvrdma should listen for
NETDEV_REGISTER and NETDEV_UNREGISTER events in its event listener code
block, and update the stored netdev pointer accordingly.  This solution
has been tested by myself and the reporter with successful results.  This
fix also allows the pvrdma driver to find its underlying ethernet device
in the event that vmxnet3 is loaded after pvrdma, which it was not able to
do before.
