drm/i915: clean up virtual PCH special case handling

Use intel_pch_type() also for mapping the no PCH case (PCH id 0) to
PCH_NONE to simplify code.

Also make sure that intel_pch_type() knows all the PCH ids returned by
intel_virt_detect_pch(). Loudly fail if this isn't the case; this
shouldn't happen anyway.
