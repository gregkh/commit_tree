bpf: Support bpf_get_socket_cookie in more prog types

bpf_get_socket_cookie() helper can be used to identify skb that
correspond to the same socket.

Though socket cookie can be useful in many other use-cases where socket is
available in program context. Specifically BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR
and BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS programs can benefit from it so that one of
them can augment a value in a map prepared earlier by other program for
the same socket.

The patch adds support to call bpf_get_socket_cookie() from
BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR and BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS.

It doesn't introduce new helpers. Instead it reuses same helper name
bpf_get_socket_cookie() but adds support to this helper to accept
`struct bpf_sock_addr` and `struct bpf_sock_ops`.

Documentation in bpf.h is changed in a way that should not break
automatic generation of markdown.
