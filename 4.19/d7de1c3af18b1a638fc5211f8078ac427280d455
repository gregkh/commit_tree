m68k: Remove unused set_clock_mmss() helpers

Commit 397ac99c6cef ("m68k: remove dead timer code") removed set_rtc_mmss()
because it was unused in 2012. However, this was itself the only user of the
mach_set_clock_mmss() callback and the many implementations of that callback,
which are equally unused.

This removes all of those as well.
