ARM: dts: armada388-helios4

The helios4 is a Armada388 based nas board designed by SolidRun and
based on their SOM. It is sold by kobol.io the dts file came from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armbian/build/master/patch/kernel/mvebu-default/95-helios4-device-tree.patch
I added a SPDX license line to match the clearfog it says it was based
on and a compatible line for "kobol,helios4"
