devlink: Add support for creating and destroying regions

This allows a device to register its supported address regions.
Each address region can be accessed directly for example reading
the snapshots taken of this address space.
Drivers are not limited in the name selection for different regions.
An example of a region-name can be: pci cr-space, register-space.
