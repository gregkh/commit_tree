perf/ring_buffer: Prevent concurent ring buffer access

Some of the scheduling tracepoints allow the perf_tp_event
code to write to ring buffer under different cpu than the
code is running on.

This results in corrupted ring buffer data demonstrated in
following perf commands:

  # perf record -e 'sched:sched_switch,sched:sched_wakeup' perf bench sched messaging
  # Running 'sched/messaging' benchmark:
  # 20 sender and receiver processes per group
  # 10 groups == 400 processes run

       Total time: 0.383 [sec]
  [ perf record: Woken up 8 times to write data ]
  0x42b890 [0]: failed to process type: -1765585640
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 4.825 MB perf.data (29669 samples) ]

  # perf report --stdio
  0x42b890 [0]: failed to process type: -1765585640

The reason for the corruption are some of the scheduling tracepoints,
that have __perf_task dfined and thus allow to store data to another
cpu ring buffer:

  sched_waking
  sched_wakeup
  sched_wakeup_new
  sched_stat_wait
  sched_stat_sleep
  sched_stat_iowait
  sched_stat_blocked

The perf_tp_event function first store samples for current cpu
related events defined for tracepoint:

    hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(event, head, hlist_entry)
      perf_swevent_event(event, count, &data, regs);

And then iterates events of the 'task' and store the sample
for any task's event that passes tracepoint checks:

  ctx = rcu_dereference(task->perf_event_ctxp[perf_sw_context]);

  list_for_each_entry_rcu(event, &ctx->event_list, event_entry) {
    if (event->attr.type != PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT)
      continue;
    if (event->attr.config != entry->type)
      continue;

    perf_swevent_event(event, count, &data, regs);
  }

Above code can race with same code running on another cpu,
ending up with 2 cpus trying to store under the same ring
buffer, which is specifically not allowed.

This patch prevents the problem, by allowing only events with the same
current cpu to receive the event.

NOTE: this requires the use of (per-task-)per-cpu buffers for this
feature to work; perf-record does this.
