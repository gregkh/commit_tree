xfs: allow null firstblock in xfs_bmapi_write() when tp is null

xfs_bmapi_write() always expects a valid firstblock pointer. It
immediately dereferences the pointer to help determine how to
initialize the bma.minleft field. The remaining accesses are
related to modifying btree format forks, which is only relevant for
!COW fork callers.

The reflink code passes a NULL transaction to xfs_bmapi_write() in a
couple places that do COW fork unwritten conversion. The purpose of
the firstblock field is to track the first block allocation in the
current transaction, so technically firstblock should not be
required for these callers either.

Tweak xfs_bmapi_write() to initialize the bma correctly without
accessing the firstblock pointer if no transaction is provided in
the first place. Update the reflink callers to pass NULL instead of
otherwise unused firstblock references.
