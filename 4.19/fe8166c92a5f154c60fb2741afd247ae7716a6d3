mfd: sec-core: Export OF module alias table

In case of Device Tree platforms, even though the Samsung PMIC sec
device is instantiated from DT, the driver is still matched through I2C
module alias.  That is because I2C core always reports an I2C module
alias instead of DT one.

This could change in the future so export DT module alias.
