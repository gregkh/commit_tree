media: ov772x: allow i2c controllers without I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING

The ov772x driver only works when the i2c controller have
I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING.  However, many i2c controller drivers don't
support it.

The reason that the ov772x requires I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING is that
it doesn't support repeated starts.

This changes the reading ov772x register method so that it doesn't
require I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING by calling two separated i2c messages.
