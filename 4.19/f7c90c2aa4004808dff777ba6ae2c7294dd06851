x86/xen: don't write ptes directly in 32-bit PV guests

In some cases 32-bit PAE PV guests still write PTEs directly instead of
using hypercalls. This is especially bad when clearing a PTE as this is
done via 32-bit writes which will produce intermediate L1TF attackable
PTEs.

Change the code to use hypercalls instead.
