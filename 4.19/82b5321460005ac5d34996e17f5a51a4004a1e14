net: hns3: Fix for reset_level default assignment probelm

handle->reset_level is assigned to HNAE3_NONE_RESET when client is
initialized, if a tx timeout happens right after initialization,
then handle->reset_level is not resetted to HNAE3_FUNC_RESET in
hclge_reset_event, which will cause reset event not properly
handled problem.

This patch fixes it by setting handle->reset_level properly when
client is initialized.
