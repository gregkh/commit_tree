btrfs: Refactor loop in btrfs_release_extent_buffer_page

The purpose of the function is to free all the pages comprising an
extent buffer. This can be achieved with a simple for loop rather than
the slightly more involved 'do {} while' construct. So rewrite the
loop using a 'for' construct. Additionally we can never have an
extent_buffer that has 0 pages so remove the check for index == 0. No
functional changes.

The reversed order used to have a meaning in the past where the first
page served as a blocking point for several callers. See eg
4f2de97acee6532b36dd6e99 ("Btrfs: set page->private to the eb").
