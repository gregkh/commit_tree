Revert "printk: make sure to print log on console."

This reverts commit 375899cddcbb26881b03cb3fbdcfd600e4e67f4a.

The visibility of early messages did not longer take into account
"quiet", "debug", and "loglevel" early parameters.

It would be possible to invalidate and recompute LOG_NOCONS flag
for the affected messages. But it would be hairy.

Instead this patch just reverts the problematic commit. We could
come up with a better solution for the original problem. For example,
we could simplify the logic and just mark messages that should always
be visible or always invisible on the console.

Also this patch reverts the related build fix commit ffaa619af1b06
("printk: Fix warning about unused suppress_message_printing").

Finally, this patch does not put back the unused LOG_NOCONS flag.
