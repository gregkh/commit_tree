coresight: etm3x: Don't use contextID with PID namespaces

Tracers can trigger trace acquisition based on contextID value, something
that isn't useful when PID namespaces are enabled.  Indeed the PID value
of a process has a different representation in the kernel and the PID
namespace, making the feature confusing and potentially leaking internal
kernel information.

As such simply return an error when the feature is being used from a
PID namespace other than the default one.
