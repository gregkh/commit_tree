sched/smt: Update sched_smt_present at runtime

The static key sched_smt_present is only updated at boot time when SMT
siblings have been detected. Booting with maxcpus=1 and bringing the
siblings online after boot rebuilds the scheduling domains correctly but
does not update the static key, so the SMT code is not enabled.

Let the key be updated in the scheduler CPU hotplug code to fix this.
