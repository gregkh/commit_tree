net: sched: change action API to use array of pointers to actions

Act API used linked list to pass set of actions to functions. It is
intrusive data structure that stores list nodes inside action structure
itself, which means it is not safe to modify such list concurrently.
However, action API doesn't use any linked list specific operations on this
set of actions, so it can be safely refactored into plain pointer array.

Refactor action API to use array of pointers to tc_actions instead of
linked list. Change argument 'actions' type of exported action init,
destroy and dump functions.
