drm/i915/icl: introduce tc_port

Add and enum for TC ports and auxiliary functions to handle them.
Icelake brings a lot of registers and other things that only apply to
the TC ports and are indexed starting from 0, so having an enum for
tc_ports that starts at 0 really helps the indexing.

This patch is based on previous patches written by Dhinakaran Pandiyan
and Mahesh Kumar.
