iwlwifi: pcie: don't access periphery registers when not available

The periphery can't be accessed before we set the
INIT_DONE bit which initializes the device.

A previous patch added a reconfiguration of the MSI-X
tables upon resume, but at that point in the flow,
INIT_DONE wasn't set. Since the reconfiguration of the
MSI-X tables require periphery access, it failed.

The difference between WoWLAN and without WoWLAN is that
in WoWLAN, iwl_trans_pcie_d3_suspend clears the INIT_DONE
without clearing the STATUS_DEVICE_ENABLED bit in the
software status. Because of that, the resume code thinks
that the device is enabled, but the INIT_DONE bit has been
cleared.

To fix this, don't reconfigure the MSI-X tables in case
WoWLAN is enabled. It will be done in
iwl_trans_pcie_d3_resume anyway.
