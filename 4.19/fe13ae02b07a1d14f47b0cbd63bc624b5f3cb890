mtd: rawnand: sm_common: convert driver to nand_scan_with_ids()

Two helpers have been added to the core to do all kind of controller
side configuration/initialization between the detection phase and the
final NAND scan. Implement these hooks so that we can convert the driver
to just use nand_scan_with_ids() (alternative to nand_scan() for passing
a flash IDs table) instead of the nand_scan_ident() + nand_scan_tail()
pair.
