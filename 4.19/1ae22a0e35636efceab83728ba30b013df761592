MIPS: Add FP_MODE regset support

Define an NT_MIPS_FP_MODE core file note and implement a corresponding
regset holding the state handled by PR_SET_FP_MODE and PR_GET_FP_MODE
prctl(2) requests.  This lets debug software correctly interpret the
contents of floating-point general registers both in live debugging and
in core files, and also switch floating-point modes of a live process.

  - Changed NT_MIPS_FP_MODE to 0x801 to match first nibble of
    NT_MIPS_DSP, which was also changed to avoid a conflict.]
