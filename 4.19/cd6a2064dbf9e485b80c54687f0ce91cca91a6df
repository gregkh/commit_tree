hwmon: k10temp: Support Threadripper 2920X, 2970WX; simplify offset table

All announced Threadripper 29xx models have a temperature offset of
27 degrees C. Simplify temperature offset table to match all 29xx
Threadripper models with a single entry. Also simplify the table to match
all 19xx Threadripper models with a single entry. This effectively drops
entries for Threadripper 1910/1920/1950 which never saw the light of day.
