staging:rtl8192u: Remove typedef and rename TX_TS_RECORD - Style

Remove the typdef from structure TX_TS_RECORD and rename to tx_ts_record.
The removal of the typedef clears the checkpatch issue with creating new
types in code. The name change, whilst not specifically flagged by
checkpatch, is an issue since types are meant to be named in lowercase.

These changes are purely coding style changes and should have no impact
on runtime execution.
