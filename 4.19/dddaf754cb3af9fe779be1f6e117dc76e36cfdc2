media: pci: cx88: Replace mdelay() with msleep() in cx88_card_setup_pre_i2c()

cx88_card_setup_pre_i2c() is never called in atomic context.
It calls mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
