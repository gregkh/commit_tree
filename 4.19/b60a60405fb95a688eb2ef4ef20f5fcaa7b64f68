netfilter: Add nf_ct_get_tuple_skb global lookup function

This adds a global netfilter function to extract a conntrack tuple from an
skb. The function uses a new function added to nf_ct_hook, which will try
to get the tuple from skb->_nfct, and do a full lookup if that fails. This
makes it possible to use the lookup function before the skb has passed
through the conntrack init hooks (e.g., in an ingress qdisc). The tuple is
copied to the caller to avoid issues with reference counting.

The function returns false if conntrack is not loaded, allowing it to be
used without incurring a module dependency on conntrack. This is used by
the NAT mode in sch_cake.
