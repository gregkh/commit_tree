tipc: make link capability update thread safe

The commit referred to below introduced an update of the link
capabilities field that is not safe. Given the recently added
feature to remove idle node and link items after 5 minutes, there
is a small risk that the update will happen at the very moment the
targeted link is being removed. To avoid this we have to perform
the update inside the node item's write lock protection.
