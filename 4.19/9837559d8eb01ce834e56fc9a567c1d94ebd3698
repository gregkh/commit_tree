atomics/treewide: Make unconditional inc/dec ops optional

Many of the inc/dec ops are mandatory, but for most architectures inc/dec are
simply trivial wrappers around their corresponding add/sub ops.

Let's make all the inc/dec ops optional, so that we can get rid of these
boilerplate wrappers.

The instrumented atomics are updated accordingly.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
