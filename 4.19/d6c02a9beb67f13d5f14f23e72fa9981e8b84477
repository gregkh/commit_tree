block: bvec_nr_vecs() returns value for wrong slab

In commit ed996a52c868 ("block: simplify and cleanup bvec pool
handling"), the value of the slab index is incremented by one in
bvec_alloc() after the allocation is done to indicate an index value of
0 does not need to be later freed.

bvec_nr_vecs() was not updated accordingly, and thus returns the wrong
value.  Decrement idx before performing the lookup.
