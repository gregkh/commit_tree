s390/css: validate subchannel prior to allocation

In css_alloc_subchannel we allocate the subchannel and do a
validation of the subchannel (to decide if we should look for
devices via this subchannel). On a typical LPAR we find lots
of subchannels to be invalid (because there is no device
attached or the device is blacklisted) leading to lots of
useless kmalloc and kfree calls.

This patch changes the order to only allocate the subchannels
that have been found valid.
