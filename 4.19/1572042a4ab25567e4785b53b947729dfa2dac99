drm: provide management functions for drm_file

Rather than doing drm_file allocation/destruction right in the fops, lets
provide separate helpers. This decouples drm_file management from the
still-mandatory drm-fops. It prepares for use of drm_file without the
fops, both by possible separate fops implementations and APIs (not that I
am aware of any such plans), and more importantly from in-kernel use where
no real file is available.
