tun: initialize napi_mutex unconditionally

This is the first part to fix following syzbot report :

console output: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/x/log.txt?x=145378e6400000
kernel config:  https://syzkaller.appspot.com/x/.config?x=443816db871edd66

Following patch is fixing the race condition, but it seems safer
to initialize this mutex at tfile creation anyway.
