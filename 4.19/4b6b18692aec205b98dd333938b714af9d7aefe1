mlxsw: spectrum_kvdl: Pass entry type to alloc/free

Future Spectrum-2 KVD linear manager implementation needs to know type
of the entry to alloc and free. So define the types in an enum and
pass it down to alloc and free functions. Once the entry type
is passed down, KVDL common part knows sizes of each entry types,
so replace size function arg with entry count.
