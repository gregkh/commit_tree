qlogic: netxen: remove various redundant variables

Variables consumer, cmd_desc, end_cnt and no_of_desc are being assigned
but are never used hence they are redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: variable 'consumer' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'cmd_desc' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'end_cnt' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'no_of_desc' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
