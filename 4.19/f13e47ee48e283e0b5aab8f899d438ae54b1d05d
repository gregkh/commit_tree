ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Remove legacy SMP fallback code

As of commit f5d70b9cee2282ec ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Prioritize DT
APMU support") in v4.8, non-DT enablement of SMP was left as a fallback
for backwards compatibility with old DTBs.

The time has come to drop backwards compatibility, hence remove the
fallback code.
