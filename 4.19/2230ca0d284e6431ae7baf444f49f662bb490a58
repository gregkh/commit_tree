pnfs: pnfs_find_lseg() should not check NFS_LSEG_LAYOUTRETURN

Layout segment validity is determined only by the NFS_LSEG_VALID flag. If
it is set, the layout segment is finable. As it is, when the flexfiles
driver sets NFS_LSEG_LAYOUTRETURN to indicate that we cannot discard
the layout segment, but that it must be returned, then this can result
in an unnecessary layoutget storm.
