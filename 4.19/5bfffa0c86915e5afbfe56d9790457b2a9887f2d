media: pci: ivtv: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL

ivtv_probe() and ivtvfb_init_card() are never called in atomic context.
They call kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC, which is not necessary.
GFP_ATOMIC can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
