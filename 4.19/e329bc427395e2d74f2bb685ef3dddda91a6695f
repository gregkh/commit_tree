net: sched: act_police: remove dependency on rtnl lock

Use tcf spinlock to protect police action private data from concurrent
modification during dump. (init already uses tcf spinlock when changing
police action state)

Pass tcf spinlock as estimator lock argument to gen_replace_estimator()
during action init.
