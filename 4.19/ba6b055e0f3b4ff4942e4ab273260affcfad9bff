HID: input: enable Totem on the Dell Canvas 27

The Dell Canvas 27 has a tool that can be put on the surface and acts
as a dial. The firmware processes the detection of the tool and forward
regular HID reports with X, Y, Azimuth, rotation, width/height.

The firmware also exports Contact ID, Countact Count which may hint that
several totems can be used at the same time (the FW only supports one).

We can tell that MT_TOOL_DIAL will be reported by setting the min/max
of ABS_MT_TOOL_TYPE to MT_TOOL_DIAL.

This tool is aimed at being used by the system and not the applications,
so the user space processing should not go through the regular touch
inputs.
We set INPUT_PROP_DIRECT which applies ID_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN to this new
type of devices, but we will counter this for the time being with the
special udev hwdb entry mentioned above.
