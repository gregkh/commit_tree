btrfs: Fix a C compliance issue

The C programming language does not allow to use preprocessor statements
inside macro arguments (pr_info() is defined as a macro). Hence rework
the pr_info() statement in btrfs_print_mod_info() such that it becomes
compliant. This patch allows tools like sparse to analyze the BTRFS
source code.
