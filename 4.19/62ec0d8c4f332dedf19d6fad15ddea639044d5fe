mm: fix BUG_ON() in vmf_insert_pfn_pud() from VM_MIXEDMAP removal

It looks like I missed the PUD path when doing VM_MIXEDMAP removal.
This can be triggered by:
1. Boot with memmap=4G!8G
2. build ndctl with destructive flag on
3. make TESTS=device-dax check

[  +0.000675] kernel BUG at mm/huge_memory.c:824!

Applying the same change that was applied to vmf_insert_pfn_pmd() in the
original patch.
