Add cgroup core selftests

This commit adds tests for some of the core functionalities
of cgroups v2.

The commit adds tests for some core principles of croup V2 API:

- test_cgcore_internal_process_constraint

  Tests internal process constraint.
  You can't add a pid to a domain parent if a controller is enabled.

- test_cgcore_top_down_constraint_enable

   Tests that you can't enable a controller on a child if it's not enabled
   on the parent.

- test_cgcore_top_down_constraint_disable

  Tests that you can't disable a controller on a parent if it's
  enabled in a child.

- test_cgcore_no_internal_process_constraint_on_threads

  Tests that there's no internal process constrain on threaded cgroups.
  You can add threads/processes on a parent with a controller enabled.

- test_cgcore_parent_becomes_threaded

  Tests that when a child becomes threaded the parent type becomes
  domain threaded.

- test_cgcore_invalid_domain

  In a situation like:

  A (domain threaded) - B (threaded) - C (domain)

  it tests that C can't be used until it is turned into a threaded cgroup.
  The "cgroup.type" file will report "domain (invalid)" in these cases.
  Operations which fail due to invalid topology use EOPNOTSUPP as the errno.

- test_cgcore_populated

  In a situation like:

  A(0) - B(0) - C(1)
         \ D(0)

  It tests that A, B and C's "populated" fields would be 1 while D's 0.
  It tests that after the one process in C is moved to root, A,B and C's
  "populated" fields would flip to "0" and file modified events will
  be generated on the "cgroup.events" files of both cgroups.
