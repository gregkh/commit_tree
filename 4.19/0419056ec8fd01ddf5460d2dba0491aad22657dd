tty: rocket: Fix possible buffer overwrite on register_PCI

If number of isa and pci boards exceed NUM_BOARDS on the path
rp_init()->init_PCI()->register_PCI() then buffer overwrite occurs
in register_PCI() on assign rcktpt_io_addr[i].

The patch adds check on upper bound for index of registered
board in register_PCI.
