net: check tunnel option type in tunnel flags

Check the tunnel option type stored in tunnel flags when creating options
for tunnels. Thereby ensuring we do not set geneve, vxlan or erspan tunnel
options on interfaces that are not associated with them.

Make sure all users of the infrastructure set correct flags, for the BPF
helper we have to set all bits to keep backward compatibility.
