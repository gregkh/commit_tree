mm/swapfile.c: use swap_count() in swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()

In swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), to identify whether there's any page
table mapping for a 4k sized swap entry, "si->swap_map[i] !=
SWAP_HAS_CACHE" is used.  This works correctly now, because all users of
the function will only call it after checking SWAP_HAS_CACHE.  But as
pointed out by Daniel, it is better to use "swap_count(map[i])" here,
because it works for "map[i] == 0" case too.

And this makes the implementation more consistent between normal and
huge swap entry.
