locking/mutex: Fix mutex debug call and ww_mutex documentation

The following commit:

  08295b3b5bee ("Implement an algorithm choice for Wound-Wait mutexes")

introduced a reference in the documentation to a function that was
removed in an earlier commit.

It also forgot to remove a call to debug_mutex_add_waiter() which is now
unconditionally called by __mutex_add_waiter().

Fix those bugs.
