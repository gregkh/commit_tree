Revert "drm/amd/display: make dm_dp_aux_transfer return payload bytes instead of size"

This reverts commit cc195141133ac3e767d930bedd8294ceebf1f10b.

This commit was problematic on other OSes. The real solution is to
leave all the error checking to DRM and don't do it in DC, which is
addressed by "Return aux replies directly to DRM" later in this patchset.

v2: Add reason for revert.
