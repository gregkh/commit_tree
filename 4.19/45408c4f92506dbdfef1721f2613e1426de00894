tracing: kprobes: Prohibit probing on notrace function

Prohibit kprobe-events probing on notrace functions.  Since probing on a
notrace function can cause a recursive event call. In most cases those are just
skipped, but in some cases it falls into an infinite recursive call.

This protection can be disabled by the kconfig
CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS_ON_NOTRACE=y, but it is highly recommended to keep it
"n" for normal kernel builds.  Note that this is only available if "kprobes on
ftrace" has been implemented on the target arch and CONFIG_KPROBES_ON_FTRACE=y.
