dmaengine: pl330: fix irq race with terminate_all

In pl330_update() when checking if a channel has been aborted, the
channel's lock is not taken, only the overall pl330_dmac lock.  But in
pl330_terminate_all() the aborted flag (req_running==-1) is set under
the channel lock and not the pl330_dmac lock.

With threaded interrupts, this leads to a potential race:

    pl330_terminate_all	        pl330_update
    -------------------         ------------
    lock channel
                                entry
    lock pl330
    _stop channel
    unlock pl330
                                lock pl330
                                check req_running != -1
    req_running = -1
                                _start channel
