drm/panel: Add device_link from panel device to DRM device

Add device_link from panel device (supplier) to DRM device (consumer)
when drm_panel_attach() is called. This patch should protect the master
DRM driver if an attached panel driver unbinds while it is in use. The
device_link should make sure the DRM device is unbound before the panel
driver becomes unavailable.

The device_link is removed when drm_panel_detach() is called. The
drm_panel_detach() should be called by the consumer DRM driver, not the
panel driver, otherwise both drivers are racing to delete the same link.
