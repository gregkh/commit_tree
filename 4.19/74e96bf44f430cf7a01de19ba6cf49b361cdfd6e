powerpc/pseries: Avoid using the size greater than RTAS_ERROR_LOG_MAX.

The global mce data buffer that used to copy rtas error log is of 2048
(RTAS_ERROR_LOG_MAX) bytes in size. Before the copy we read
extended_log_length from rtas error log header, then use max of
extended_log_length and RTAS_ERROR_LOG_MAX as a size of data to be copied.
Ideally the platform (phyp) will never send extended error log with
size > 2048. But if that happens, then we have a risk of buffer overrun
and corruption. Fix this by using min_t instead.
