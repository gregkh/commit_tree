cxl: Fix wrong comparison in cxl_adapter_context_get()

Function atomic_inc_unless_negative() returns a bool to indicate
success/failure. However cxl_adapter_context_get() wrongly compares
the return value against '>=0' which will always be true. The patch
fixes this comparison to '==0' there by also fixing this compile time
warning:

	drivers/misc/cxl/main.c:290 cxl_adapter_context_get()
	warn: 'atomic_inc_unless_negative(&adapter->contexts_num)' is unsigned

Fixes: 70b565bbdb91 ("cxl: Prevent adapter reset if an active context exists")
