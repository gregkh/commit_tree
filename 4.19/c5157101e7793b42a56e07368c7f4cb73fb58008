arm64: mm: Export __sync_icache_dcache() for xen-privcmd

The xen-privcmd driver, which can be modular, calls set_pte_at()
which in turn may call __sync_icache_dcache().

The call to __sync_icache_dcache() may be optimised out because it is
conditional on !pte_special(), and xen-privcmd calls pte_mkspecial().
But it seems unwise to rely on this optimisation.
