ALSA: usb-audio: quirks: Replace mdelay() with msleep() and usleep_range()

snd_usb_select_mode_quirk(), snd_usb_set_interface_quirk() and
snd_usb_ctl_msg_quirk() are never called in atomic context.
They call mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep() and usleep_range().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
