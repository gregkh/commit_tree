KVM: vmx: always initialize HOST_{FS,GS}_BASE to zero during setup

The HOST_{FS,GS}_BASE fields are guaranteed to be written prior to
VMENTER, by way of vmx_prepare_switch_to_guest().  Initialize the
fields to zero for 64-bit kernels instead of pulling the base values
from their respective MSRs.  In addition to eliminating two RDMSRs,
vmx_prepare_switch_to_guest() can safely assume the initial value of
the fields is zero in all cases.
