fpga: mgr: add compat_id support

This patch introduces compat_id support to fpga manager, it adds
a fpga_compat_id pointer to fpga manager data structure to allow
fpga manager drivers to save the compatibility id. This compat_id
could be used for compatibility checking before doing partial
reconfiguration to associated fpga regions.
