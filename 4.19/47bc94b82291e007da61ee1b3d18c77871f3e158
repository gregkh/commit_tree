net/mlx5: Check for error in mlx5_attach_interface

Currently, mlx5_attach_interface does not check for error
after calling intf->attach or intf->add. When these two calls
fails, the client is not initialized and will cause issues such as
kernel panic on invalid address in the teardown path (mlx5_detach_interface)
