ACPI / scan: Initialize status to ACPI_STA_DEFAULT

Since commit 63347db0affa "ACPI / scan: Use acpi_bus_get_status() to
initialize ACPI_TYPE_DEVICE devs" the status field of normal acpi_devices
gets set to 0 by acpi_bus_type_and_status() and filled with its actual
value later when acpi_add_single_object() calls acpi_bus_get_status().

This means that any acpi_match_device_ids() calls in between will always
fail with -ENOENT.

We already have a workaround for this, which temporary forces status to
ACPI_STA_DEFAULT in drivers/acpi/x86/utils.c: acpi_device_always_present()
and the next commit in this series adds another acpi_match_device_ids()
call between status being initialized as 0 and the acpi_bus_get_status()
call.

Rather then adding another workaround, this commit makes
acpi_bus_type_and_status() initialize status to ACPI_STA_DEFAULT, this is
safe to do as the only code looking at status between the initialization
and the acpi_bus_get_status() call is those acpi_match_device_ids() calls.

Note this does mean that we need to (re)set status to 0 in case the
acpi_bus_get_status() call fails.
