drm/sun4i: Remove R40 display pipeline compatibles

Two patches from the R40 display pipeline support series weren't applied
with the rest of the series. When they did get applied, the -rc6
deadline for drm-misc-next had past, so they didn't get into 4.19-rc1
with the rest of the series. However, the two patches are crucial in
the parsing of the R40's display pipeline graph in the device tree.
Without them, the driver crashes because it can't follow the odd graph
structure.

This patch removes the R40 compatibles from the sun4i-drm driver,
effectively disabling DRM support for the R40 for one release cycle.
This will prevent the driver from crashing upon probing.

The compatibles should be reinstated for the next release.
