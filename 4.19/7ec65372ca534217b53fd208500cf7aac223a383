tcp: add stat of data packet reordering events

Introduce a new TCP stats to record the number of reordering events seen
and expose it in both tcp_info (TCP_INFO) and opt_stats
(SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS).
Application can use this stats to track the frequency of the reordering
events in addition to the existing reordering stats which tracks the
magnitude of the latest reordering event.

Note: this new stats tracks reordering events triggered by ACKs, which
could often be fewer than the actual number of packets being delivered
out-of-order.
