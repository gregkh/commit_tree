ACPI/IORT: Don't set default coherent DMA mask

Now that we can track upstream DMA constraints properly with
bus_dma_mask instead of trying (and failing) to maintain it in
coherent_dma_mask, it doesn't make much sense for the firmware code to
be touching the latter at all. It's merely papering over bugs wherein a
driver has failed to call dma_set_coherent_mask() *and* the bus code has
not initialised any default value.

We don't really want to encourage more drivers coercing dma_mask so
we'll continue to fix that up if necessary, but add a warning to help
flush out any such buggy bus code that remains.
