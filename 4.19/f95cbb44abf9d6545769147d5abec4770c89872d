gfs2: use iomap_readpage for blocksize == PAGE_SIZE

We only use iomap_readpage for pages that don't have buffer heads
attached yet: iomap_readpage would otherwise read pages from disk that
are marked buffer_uptodate() but not PageUptodate().  Those pages may
actually contain data more recent than what's on disk.
