KVM: vmx: Add defines for SGX ENCLS exiting

Hardware support for basic SGX virtualization adds a new execution
control (ENCLS_EXITING), VMCS field (ENCLS_EXITING_BITMAP) and exit
reason (ENCLS), that enables a VMM to intercept specific ENCLS leaf
functions, e.g. to inject faults when the VMM isn't exposing SGX to
a VM.  When ENCLS_EXITING is enabled, the VMM can set/clear bits in
the bitmap to intercept/allow ENCLS leaf functions in non-root, e.g.
setting bit 2 in the ENCLS_EXITING_BITMAP will cause ENCLS[EINIT]
to VMExit(ENCLS).

Note: EXIT_REASON_ENCLS was previously added by commit 1f5199927034
("KVM: VMX: add missing exit reasons").
