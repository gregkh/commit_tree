sctp: hold transport before accessing its asoc in sctp_transport_get_next

As Marcelo noticed, in sctp_transport_get_next, it is iterating over
transports but then also accessing the association directly, without
checking any refcnts before that, which can cause an use-after-free
Read.

So fix it by holding transport before accessing the association. With
that, sctp_transport_hold calls can be removed in the later places.
