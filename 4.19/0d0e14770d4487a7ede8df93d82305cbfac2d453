MIPS: Make (UN)CAC_ADDR() PHYS_OFFSET-agnostic

Converting an address between cached & uncached (typically addresses in
(c)kseg0 & (c)kseg1 or 2 xkphys regions) should not depend upon
PHYS_OFFSET in any way - we're converting from a virtual address in one
unmapped region to a virtual address in another unmapped region.

For some reason our CAC_ADDR() & UNCAC_ADDR() macros make use of
PAGE_OFFSET, which typically includes PHYS_OFFSET. This means that
platforms with a non-zero PHYS_OFFSET typically have to workaround
miscalculation by these 2 macros by also defining UNCAC_BASE to a value
that isn't really correct.

It appears that an attempt has previously been made to address this with
commit 3f4579252aa1 ("MIPS: make CAC_ADDR and UNCAC_ADDR account for
PHYS_OFFSET") which was later undone by commit ed3ce16c3d2b ("Revert
"MIPS: make CAC_ADDR and UNCAC_ADDR account for PHYS_OFFSET"") which
also introduced the ar7 workaround. That attempt at a fix was roughly
equivalent, but essentially caused the CAC_ADDR() & UNCAC_ADDR() macros
to cancel out PHYS_OFFSET by adding & then subtracting it again. In his
revert Leonid is correct that using PHYS_OFFSET makes no sense in the
context of these macros, but appears to have missed its inclusion via
PAGE_OFFSET which means PHYS_OFFSET actually had an effect after the
revert rather than before it.

Here we fix this by modifying CAC_ADDR() & UNCAC_ADDR() to stop using
PAGE_OFFSET (& thus PHYS_OFFSET), instead using __pa() & __va() along
with UNCAC_BASE.

For UNCAC_ADDR(), __pa() will convert a cached address to a physical
address which we can simply use as an offset from UNCAC_BASE to obtain
an address in the uncached region.

For CAC_ADDR() we can undo the effect of UNCAC_ADDR() by subtracting
UNCAC_BASE and using __va() on the result.

With this change made, remove definitions of UNCAC_BASE from the ar7 &
pic32 platforms which appear to have defined them only to workaround
this problem.
