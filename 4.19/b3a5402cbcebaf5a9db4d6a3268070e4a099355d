ALSA: hda: Fix the audio-component completion timeout

The timeout of audio component binding was incorrectly specified in
msec, not in jiffies, which results in way too shorter timeout than
expected.

Along with fixing it, add the information print about the binding
failure to show the unexpected situation more clearly.
