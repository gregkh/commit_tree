drm/i915/gtt: Don't restore the non-existent PDE for GGTT

On resume, we have to rewrite all the PDE entries for gen7 ppgtts. If we
switch on full-ppgtt, there is then one address space with no PDE, the
GGTT. Currently under aliasing-ppgtt, the GGTT address space does have
an associated ppgtt and so the restore works just fine. We would have a
similar problem if we tried disabling aliasing-ppgtt
(i915.enable_ppgtt=0). So skip the empty ppgtt, as being non-existent it
doesn't need restoring.
