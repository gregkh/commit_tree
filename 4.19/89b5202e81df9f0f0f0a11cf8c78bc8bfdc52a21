s390/decompressor: support uncompressed kernel

Implement uncompressed kernel support (when "None" is picked in kernel
compression mode list). In that case an actual decompression code is
skipped and control is passed from boot/head.S to startup_continue in
kernel/head64.S. To achieve that uncompressed kernel payload is
conditionally put at 0x100000 in bzImage.

In reality this is very close to classic uncompressed kernel "image",
but the decompressor has its own build and link process,
kernel/head64.S lives at 0x100000 rather than at 0x11000, and .bss
section is reused for both stages.
