net/tipc: remove redundant variables 'tn' and 'oport'

Variables 'tn' and 'oport'  are being assigned but are never used hence
they are redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: variable 'oport' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'tn' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
