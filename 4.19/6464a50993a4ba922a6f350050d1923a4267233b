staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page 1 definitions - Style

Remove all the "page 1" definitions as they are not used in code.

A lot of these definitions, if not all, fail checkpatch because of
CamelCase issues. Rather then change the names of unused constants
simply remove. This is a coding style change which should have no
impact on runtime execution.
