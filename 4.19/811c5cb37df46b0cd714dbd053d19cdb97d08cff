PCI: Unify try slot and bus reset API

Drivers are expected to call pci_try_reset_slot() or pci_try_reset_bus() by
querying if a system supports hotplug or not.  A survey showed that most
drivers don't do this and we are leaking hotplug capability to the user.

Hide pci_try_slot_reset() from drivers and embed into pci_try_bus_reset().
Change pci_try_reset_bus() parameter from struct pci_bus to struct pci_dev.
