md-cluster: show array's status more accurate

When resync or recovery is happening in one node,
other nodes don't show the appropriate info now.

For example, when create an array in master node
without "--assume-clean", then assemble the array
in slave nodes, you can see "resync=PENDING" when
read /proc/mdstat in slave nodes. However, the info
is confusing since "PENDING" status is introduced
for start array in read-only mode.

We introduce RESYNCING_REMOTE flag to indicate that
resync thread is running in remote node. The flags
is set when node receive RESYNCING msg. And we clear
the REMOTE flag in following cases:

1. resync or recover is finished in master node,
   which means slaves receive msg with both lo
   and hi are set to 0.
2. node continues resync/recovery in recover_bitmaps.
3. when resync_finish is called.

Then we show accurate information in status_resync
by check REMOTE flags and with other conditions.
