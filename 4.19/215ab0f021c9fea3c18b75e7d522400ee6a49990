xfrm6: call kfree_skb when skb is toobig

After commit d6990976af7c5d8f55903bfb4289b6fb030bf754 ("vti6: fix PMTU caching
and reporting on xmit"), some too big skbs might be potentially passed down to
__xfrm6_output, causing it to fail to transmit but not free the skb, causing a
leak of skb, and consequentially a leak of dst references.

After running pmtu.sh, that shows as failure to unregister devices in a namespace:

[  311.397671] unregister_netdevice: waiting for veth_b to become free. Usage count = 1

The fix is to call kfree_skb in case of transmit failures.
