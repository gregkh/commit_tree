btrfs: simplify pointer chasing of local fs_info variables

Functions that get btrfs inode can simply reach the fs_info by
dereferencing the root and this looks a bit more straightforward
compared to the btrfs_sb(...) indirection.

If the transaction handle is available and not NULL it's used instead.
