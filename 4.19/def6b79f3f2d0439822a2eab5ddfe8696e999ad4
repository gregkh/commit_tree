staging:rtl8192u: Remove proxy array rtl819XAGCTAB_Array - Style

Remove the array rtl819XAGCTAB_Array which is only a proxy to the
array Rtl8192UsbAGCTAB_Array. There appears to be no purpose
served by this implementation, other then to obscure the
Rtl8192UsbAGCTAB_Array structure, which is actually written to and
read from.
