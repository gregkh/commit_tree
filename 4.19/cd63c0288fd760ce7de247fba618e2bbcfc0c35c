media: sta2x11: Add video_device and vb2_queue locks

Currently, this driver does not serialize its video4linux
ioctls, which is a bug, as race conditions might appear.

In addition, video_device and vb2_queue locks are now both
mandatory. Add them, and implement wait_prepare and
wait_finish.

To stay on the safe side, this commit uses a single mutex
for both locks. Better latency can be obtained by separating
these if needed.
