mtd: rawnand: denali: optimize timing parameters for data interface

This commit improves the ->setup_data_interface() hook.

The denali_setup_data_interface() needs the frequency of clk_x
and the ratio of clk_x / clk.

The latter is currently hardcoded in the driver, like this:

  #define DENALI_CLK_X_MULT       6

The IP datasheet requires that clk_x / clk be 4, 5, or 6.  I just
chose 6 because it is the most defensive value, but it is not optimal.
By getting the clock rate of both "clk" and "clk_x", the driver can
compute the timing values more precisely.

To not break the existing platforms, the fallback value, 50 MHz is
provided.  It is true for all upstreamed platforms.
