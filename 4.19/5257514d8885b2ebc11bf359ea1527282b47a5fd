rcu: Make expedited grace period use direct call on last leaf

During expedited grace-period initialization, a work item is scheduled
for each leaf rcu_node structure.  However, that initialization code
is itself (normally) executing from a workqueue, so one of the leaf
rcu_node structures could just as well be handled by that pre-existing
workqueue, and with less overhead.  This commit therefore uses a
shiny new rcu_is_leaf_node() macro to execute the last leaf rcu_node
structure's initialization directly from the pre-existing workqueue.
