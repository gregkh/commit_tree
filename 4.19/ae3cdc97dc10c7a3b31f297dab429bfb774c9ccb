batman-adv: Prevent duplicated tvlv handler

The function batadv_tvlv_handler_register is responsible for adding new
tvlv_handler to the handler_list. It first checks whether the entry
already is in the list or not. If it is, then the creation of a new entry
is aborted.

But the lock for the list is only held when the list is really modified.
This could lead to duplicated entries because another context could create
an entry with the same key between the check and the list manipulation.

The check and the manipulation of the list must therefore be in the same
locked code section.
