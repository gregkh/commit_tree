x86/mm/tlb: Only send page table free TLB flush to lazy TLB CPUs

CPUs in !is_lazy have either received TLB flush IPIs earlier on during
the munmap (when the user memory was unmapped), or have context switched
and reloaded during that stage of the munmap.

Page table free TLB flushes only need to be sent to CPUs in lazy TLB
mode, which TLB contents might not yet be up to date yet.
