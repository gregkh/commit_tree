s390: fix br_r1_trampoline for machines without exrl

For machines without the exrl instruction the BFP jit generates
code that uses an "br %r1" instruction located in the lowcore page.
Unfortunately there is a cut & paste error that puts an additional
"larl %r1,.+14" instruction in the code that clobbers the branch
target address in %r1. Remove the larl instruction.
