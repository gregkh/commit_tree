x86/intel_rdt: Respect read and write access

By default, if the opener has CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, a kernfs file can be opened
regardless of RW permissions. Writing to a kernfs file will thus succeed
even if permissions are 0000.

It's required to restrict the actions that can be performed on a resource
group from userspace based on the mode of the resource group.  This
restriction will be done through a modification of the file
permissions. That is, for example, if a resource group is locked then the
user cannot add tasks to the resource group.

For this restriction through file permissions to work it has to be ensured
that the permissions are always respected. To do so the resctrl filesystem
is created with the KERNFS_ROOT_EXTRA_OPEN_PERM_CHECK flag that will result
in open(2) failing with -EACCESS regardless of CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE if the
permission does not have the respective read or write access.
