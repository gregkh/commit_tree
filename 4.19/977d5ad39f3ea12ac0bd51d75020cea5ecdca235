ACPI: Convert ACPI reference args to generic fwnode reference args

Convert all users of struct acpi_reference_args to more generic
fwnode_reference_args. This will

 1) avoid an ACPI specific references to device nodes with integer
    arguments as well as

 2) allow making references to nodes other than device nodes in ACPI.

As a by-product, convert the fwnode interger arguments to u64. The
arguments were 64-bit integers on ACPI but the fwnode arguments were
just 32-bit.
