can: sja1000: Replace mdelay with usleep_range in peak_pci_probe

peak_pci_probe() is never called in atomic context.

peak_pci_probe() is set as ".probe" in struct pci_driver.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, peak_pci_probe()
calls mdelay() to busily wait.
This is not necessary and can be replaced with usleep_range() to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
