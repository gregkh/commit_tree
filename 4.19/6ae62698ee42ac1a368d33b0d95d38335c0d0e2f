staging:rtl8192u: remove typedef of struct TS_COMMON_INFO - Style

To clear a checkpatch issue removed the typedef of the structure
TS_COMMON_INFO.

This change removes the previous declaration, which defined two types, both
TS_COMMON_INFO and a pointer type PTS_COMMON_INFO:

typedef struct _TS_COMMON_INFO {
	...
} TS_COMMON_INFO, *PTS_COMMON_INFO;

The pointer type has been completely removed from the code, as:
"(so-called Hungarian notation) is brain damaged" according to the coding
standard.
