x86/intel_rdt: Split resource group removal in two

Resource groups used for pseudo-locking do not require the same work on
removal as the other resource groups.

The resource group removal is split in two in preparation for support of
pseudo-locking resource groups. A single re-ordering occurs - the
setting of the rdtgrp flag is moved to later. This flag is not used by
any of the code between its original and new location.
