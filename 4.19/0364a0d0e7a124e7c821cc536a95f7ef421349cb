igb: Only change Tx arbitration when CBS is on

Currently the data transmission arbitration algorithm - DataTranARB
field on TQAVCTRL reg - is always set to CBS when the Tx mode is
changed from legacy to 'Qav' mode.

Make that configuration a bit more granular in preparation for the
upcoming Launchtime enabling patches, since CBS and Launchtime can be
enabled separately. That is achieved by moving the DataTranARB setup
to igb_config_tx_modes() instead.

Similarly, when disabling CBS we must check if it has been disabled
for all queues, and clear the DataTranARB accordingly.
