Bluetooth: btqca: Redefine qca_uart_setup() to generic function.

Redefinition of qca_uart_setup will help future Qualcomm Bluetooth
SoC, to use the same function instead of duplicating the function.
Added new arguments soc_type and soc_ver to the functions.

These arguments will help to decide type of firmware files
to be loaded into Bluetooth chip.
soc_type holds the Bluetooth chip connected to APPS processor.
soc_ver holds the Bluetooth chip version.
