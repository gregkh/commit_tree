net: sched: introduce chain object to uapi

Allow user to create, destroy, get and dump chain objects. Do that by
extending rtnl commands by the chain-specific ones. User will now be
able to explicitly create or destroy chains (so far this was done only
automatically according the filter/act needs and refcounting). Also, the
user will receive notification about any chain creation or destuction.
