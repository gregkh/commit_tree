serial: xuartps: fix typo in cdns_uart_startup

The bit mask changes in commit 6e14f7c1f2c2 ("tty: xuartps: Improve
startup function") doesn't do what the commit message advertises. The
original behaviour was clearing the RX_DIS bit, but due to missing ~,
that bit is now the only bit kept.

Currently, the regression is harmless, because the previous write to the
control register sets it to TXRST | RXRST. Thus the RX_DIS bit is
previously cleared. The *RST bits are cleared by the hardware, so this
commit does not currently change behaviour, but makes future changes
less risky.
