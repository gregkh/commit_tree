mlxsw: spectrum: Implement chain template hinting

Since cld_flower provides information about the filter template for
specific chain, use this information in order to prepare a region.
Use the template to find out what elements are going to be used
and pass that down to mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_add(). Later on, when the
first filter is inserted, the mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_use_patterns()
function would use this element usage information instead of looking
up a pattern.
