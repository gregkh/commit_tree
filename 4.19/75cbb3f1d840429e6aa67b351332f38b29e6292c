bcache: stop using the deprecated get_seconds()

The get_seconds function is deprecated now since it returns a 32-bit
value that will eventually overflow, and we are replacing it throughout
the kernel with ktime_get_seconds() or ktime_get_real_seconds() that
return a time64_t.

bcache uses get_seconds() to read the current system time and store it in
the superblock as well as in uuid_entry structures that are user visible.

Unfortunately, the two structures in are still limited to 32 bits, so this
won't fix any real problems but will still overflow in year 2106. Let's
at least document that properly, in case we get an updated format in the
future it can be fixed. We still have a long time before the overflow
and checking the tools at https://github.com/koverstreet/bcache-tools
reveals no access to any of them.
