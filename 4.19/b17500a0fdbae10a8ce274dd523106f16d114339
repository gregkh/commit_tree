staging: erofs: introduce xattr & acl support

This implements xattr and acl functionalities.

Inline and shared xattrs are introduced for flexibility.
Specifically, if the same xattr occurs for many times
in a large number of inodes or the value of a xattr is so large
that it isn't suitable to be inlined, a shared xattr
kept in the xattr meta will be used instead.
