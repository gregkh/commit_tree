ipvs: don't show negative times in ip_vs_conn

Since commit 500462a9de65 ("timers: Switch to a non-cascading wheel"),
timers duration can last even 12.5% more than the scheduled interval.

IPVS has two handlers, /proc/net/ip_vs_conn and /proc/net/ip_vs_conn_sync,
which shows the remaining time before that a connection expires.
The default expire time for a connection is 60 seconds, and the
expiration timer can fire even 4 seconds later than the scheduled time.
The expiration time is calculated subtracting jiffies to the scheduled
expiration time, and it's shown as a huge number when the timer fires late,
since both values are unsigned.

This can confuse script and tools which relies on it, like ipvsadm:
