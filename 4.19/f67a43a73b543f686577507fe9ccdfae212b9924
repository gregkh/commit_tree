s390/qeth: remove unused buffer->aob pointer

Except for tracing, the pointer is not used.

At the same time, accessing it from qeth_qdio_output_handler() is racy:
whenever qeth_qdio_cq_handler() gets control, its call to
qeth_qdio_handle_aob() frees the AOB.

So the AOB pointer that qeth_qdio_output_handler() stores into 'buffer'
can go stale at any time, and trigger a use-after-free.
