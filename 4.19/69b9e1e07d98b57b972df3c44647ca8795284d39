ipv4: add __ip_queue_xmit() that supports tos param

This patch introduces __ip_queue_xmit(), through which the callers
can pass tos param into it without having to set inet->tos. For
ipv6, ip6_xmit() already allows passing tclass parameter.

It's needed when some transport protocol doesn't use inet->tos,
like sctp's per transport dscp, which will be added in next patch.
