MIPS: VDSO: Match data page cache colouring when D$ aliases

When a system suffers from dcache aliasing a user program may observe
stale VDSO data from an aliased cache line. Notably this can break the
expectation that clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...) is, as its name
suggests, monotonic.

In order to ensure that users observe updates to the VDSO data page as
intended, align the user mappings of the VDSO data page such that their
cache colouring matches that of the virtual address range which the
kernel will use to update the data page - typically its unmapped address
within kseg0.

This ensures that we don't introduce aliasing cache lines for the VDSO
data page, and therefore that userland will observe updates without
requiring cache invalidation.
