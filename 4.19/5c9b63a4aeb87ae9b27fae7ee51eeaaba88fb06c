staging:rtl8192u: Remove unused page c definitions - Style

Remove unused 'page c' definitions. These definitions fail the checkpatch
CamelCase test, to save renaming, these unused definitions have simply
been removed. This is a coding style change which should not have an
impact on runtime code execution.
