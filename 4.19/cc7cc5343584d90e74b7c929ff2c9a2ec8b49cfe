drm/i915: Remove stale asserts from i915_gem_find_active_request()

Since we use i915_gem_find_active_request() from inside
intel_engine_dump() and may call that at any time, we do not guarantee
that the engine is paused nor that the signal kthreads and irq handler
are suspended, so we cannot assert that the breadcrumb doesn't advance
and that the irq hasn't happened on another CPU signaling the request we
believe to be idle.

The second assert removed (that request->engine == engine) remains
valid, but is now more rigorously checked during retirement.
