mm: workingset: make shadow_lru_isolate() use locking suffix

shadow_lru_isolate() disables interrupts and acquires a lock.  It could
use spin_lock_irq() instead.  It also uses local_irq_enable() while it
could use spin_unlock_irq()/xa_unlock_irq().

Use proper suffix for lock/unlock in order to enable/disable interrupts
during release/acquire of a lock.
