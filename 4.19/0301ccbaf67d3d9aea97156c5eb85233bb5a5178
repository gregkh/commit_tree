drm/amd/display: DP Compliance 400.1.1 failure

[Why]
400.1.1 is failing because we are not performing link training when
we get an HPD pulse for the same display. This is breaking DP
compliance

[How]
Always perform link training after HPD pulse if the detection
reason is not  DETECT_REASON_HPDRX.
