drm/i915: Pass hpd_pin to long_pulse_detect()

We're doing a pointless translation from hpd_pin to port simply for
passing the thing to long_pulse_detect(). Let's pass the hpd_pin
directly instead.

This removes the assumption that the hpd_pin and port always
match. The only other place where we make that assumption anymore
is intel_hpd_pin_default() and that's fine as it's what determines
the relationship between the two. If we ever get hardware where
the hpd pins are wired in more interesting ways it should be
trivial to handle from now on.

This should also fix the IS_CNL_WITH_PORT_F() case as that mapped
pin E back to port F and passed that to
spt_port_hotplug2_long_detect() which would always return false
for port F. Now that we pass in pin E directly it'll actually
do the right thing.
