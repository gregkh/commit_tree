mm/oom_kill.c: clean up oom_reap_task_mm()

Andrew has noticed some inconsistencies in oom_reap_task_mm.  Notably

 - Undocumented return value.

 - comment "failed to reap part..." is misleading - sounds like it's
   referring to something which happened in the past, is in fact
   referring to something which might happen in the future.

 - fails to call trace_finish_task_reaping() in one case

 - code duplication.

 - Increases mmap_sem hold time a little by moving
   trace_finish_task_reaping() inside the locked region.  So sue me ;)

 - Sharing the finish: path means that the trace event won't
   distinguish between the two sources of finishing.

Add a short explanation for the return value and fix the rest by
reorganizing the function a bit to have unified function exit paths.
