ALSA: pcm: Use snd_pcm_stop_xrun() for xrun injection

Basically the xrun injection routine can simply call the standard
helper snd_pcm_stop_xrun(), but with one exception: it may be called
even when the stream is closed.

Make snd_pcm_stop_xrun() more robust and check the NULL runtime state,
and simplify xrun injection code by calling it.
