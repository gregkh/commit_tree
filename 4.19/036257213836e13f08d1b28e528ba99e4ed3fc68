xfs: simplify xfs_aops_discard_page

Instead of looking at the buffer heads to see if a block is delalloc just
call xfs_bmap_punch_delalloc_range on the whole page - this will leave
any non-delalloc block intact and handle the iteration for us.  As a side
effect one more place stops caring about buffer heads and we can remove the
xfs_check_page_type function entirely.
