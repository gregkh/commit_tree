powerpc/powernv: implement opal_put_chars_atomic

The RAW console does not need writes to be atomic, so relax
opal_put_chars to be able to do partial writes, and implement an
_atomic variant which does not take a spinlock. This API is used
in xmon, so the less locking that is used, the better chance there
is that a crash can be debugged.
