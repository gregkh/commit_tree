mm/memory_hotplug.c: drop unnecessary checks from register_mem_sect_under_node()

Callers of register_mem_sect_under_node() are always passing a valid
memory_block (not NULL), so we can safely drop the check for NULL.

In the same way, register_mem_sect_under_node() is only called in case
the node is online, so we can safely remove that check as well.
