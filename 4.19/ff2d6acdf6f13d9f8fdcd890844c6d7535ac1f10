ALSA: pcm: Fix snd_interval_refine first/last with open min/max

Without this commit the following intervals [x y), (x y) were be
replaced to (y-1 y) by snd_interval_refine_last(). This was also done
if y-1 is part of the previous interval.
With this changes it will be replaced with [y-1 y) in case of y-1 is
part of the previous interval. A similar behavior will be used for
snd_interval_refine_first().

This commit adapts the changes for alsa-lib of commit
9bb985c ("pcm: snd_interval_refine_first/last: exclude value only if
also excluded before")
