drm/i915: Fix pre-ILK error interrupt ack

Adjust the EIR clearing to cope with the edge triggered IIR
on i965/g4x. To guarantee an edge in the ISR master error bit
we temporarily mask everything in EMR. As some of the EIR bits
can't even be directly cleared we also borrow a trick from
i915_clear_error_registers() and permanently mask any bit that
remains high. No real thought given to how we might unmask them
again once the cause for the error has been clered. I suppose
on pre-g4x GPU reset will reinitialize EMR from scratch.
