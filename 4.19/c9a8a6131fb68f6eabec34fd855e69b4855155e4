perf tools: Move the temp file processing into decompress_kmodule

We will add a compression check in the following patch and it makes it
easier if the file processing is done in a single place. It also makes
the current code simpler.

The decompress_kmodule function now returns the fd of the uncompressed
file and the file name in the pathname arg, if it's provided.
