xfs: detect and fix bad summary counts at mount

Filippo Giunchedi complained that xfs doesn't even perform basic sanity
checks of the fs summary counters at mount time.  Therefore, recalculate
the summary counters from the AGFs after log recovery if the counts were
bad (or we had to recover the fs).  Enhance the recalculation routine to
fail the mount entirely if the new values are also obviously incorrect.

We use a mount state flag to record the "bad summary count" state so
that the (subsequent) online fsck patches can detect subtlely incorrect
counts and set the flag; clear it userspace asks for a repair; or force
a recalculation at the next mount if nobody fixes it by unmount time.
