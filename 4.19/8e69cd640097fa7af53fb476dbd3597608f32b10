ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Simplify card long-name

Now that the headset-mic is always IN3 there is no reason to have
the headset-mic mapping in the long-name.

This commit simplifies the long name to "bytcr-rt5651-<intmic-map>-mic".

We can safely do this without causing regressions (UCM profile not found
due to the longname change) as the UCM profiles are not in upstream
alsa-lib yet.
