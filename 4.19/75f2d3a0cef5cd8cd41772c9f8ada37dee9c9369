x86/xen: enable early use of set_fixmap in 32-bit Xen PV guest

Commit 7b25b9cb0dad83 ("x86/xen/time: Initialize pv xen time in
init_hypervisor_platform()") moved the mapping of the shared info area
before pagetable_init(). This breaks booting as 32-bit PV guest as the
use of set_fixmap isn't possible at this time on 32-bit.

This can be worked around by populating the needed PMD on 32-bit
kernel earlier.

In order not to reimplement populate_extra_pte() using extend_brk()
for allocating new page tables extend alloc_low_pages() to do that in
case the early page table pool is not yet available.
