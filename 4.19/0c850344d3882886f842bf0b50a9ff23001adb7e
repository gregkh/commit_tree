sch_cake: Conditionally split GSO segments

At lower bandwidths, the transmission time of a single GSO segment can add
an unacceptable amount of latency due to HOL blocking. Furthermore, with a
software shaper, any tuning mechanism employed by the kernel to control the
maximum size of GSO segments is thrown off by the artificial limit on
bandwidth. For this reason, we split GSO segments into their individual
packets iff the shaper is active and configured to a bandwidth <= 1 Gbps.
