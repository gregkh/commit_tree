drm/i915/psr: Kill useless function pointers.

At some point we introduced the function pointers
on PSR code to help with VLV/CHV separation logic
because it had a different HW implementation from PSR.

Since all converged to HSW PSR and we dropped the
VLV/CHV support, let's also kill the useless function
pointers and leave the code cleaner.
