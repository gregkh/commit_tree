bnxt_en: Fix enables field in HWRM_QUEUE_COS2BW_CFG request

In HWRM_QUEUE_COS2BW_CFG request, enables field should have the bits
set only for the queue ids which are having the valid parameters.

This causes firmware to return error when the TC to hardware CoS queue
mapping is not 1:1 during DCBNL ETS setup.
