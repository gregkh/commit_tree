time: Introduce struct __kernel_itimerspec

struct itimerspec is not y2038-safe.

Introduce a new struct __kernel_itimerspec based on the kernel internal
y2038-safe struct itimerspec64.

The definition of struct __kernel_itimerspec includes two struct
__kernel_timespec.

Since struct __kernel_timespec has the same representation in native and
compat modes, so does struct __kernel_itimerspec. This helps have a common
entry point for syscalls using struct __kernel_itimerspec.

New y2038-safe syscalls will use this new type. Since most of the new
syscalls are just an update to the native syscalls with the type update,
place the new definition under CONFIG_64BIT_TIME. This helps architectures
that do not support the above config to keep using the old definition of
struct itimerspec.

Also change the get/put_itimerspec64 to use struct__kernel_itimerspec.
This will help 32 bit architectures to use the new syscalls when
architectures select CONFIG_64BIT_TIME.
