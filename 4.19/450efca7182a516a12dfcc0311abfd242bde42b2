rcutorture: Disable RT throttling for boost tests

Currently rcutorture is not able to torture RCU boosting properly. This
is because the rcutorture's boost threads which are doing the torturing
may be throttled due to RT throttling.

This patch makes rcutorture use the right torture technique (unthrottled
rcutorture boost tasks) for torturing RCU so that the test fails
correctly when no boost is available.

Currently this requires accessing sysctl_sched_rt_runtime directly, but
that should be Ok since rcutorture is test code. Such direct access is
also only possible if rcutorture is used as a built-in so make it
conditional on that.
