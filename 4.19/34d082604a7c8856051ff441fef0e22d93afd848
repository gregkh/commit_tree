reiserfs: use monotonic time for j_trans_start_time

Using CLOCK_REALTIME time_t timestamps breaks on 32-bit systems in 2038,
and gives surprising results with a concurrent settimeofday().

This changes the reiserfs journal timestamps to use ktime_get_seconds()
instead, which makes it use a 64-bit CLOCK_MONOTONIC stamp.

In the procfs output, the monotonic timestamp needs to be converted back
to CLOCK_REALTIME to keep the existing ABI.
