nfp: bpf: allow receiving perf events on data queues

Control queue is fairly low latency, and requires SKB allocations,
which means we can't even reach 0.5Msps with perf events.  Allow
perf events to be delivered to data queues.  This allows us to not
only use multiple queues, but also receive and deliver to user space
more than 5Msps per queue (Xeon E5-2630 v4 2.20GHz, no retpolines).
