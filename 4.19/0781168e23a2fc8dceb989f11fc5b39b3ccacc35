yam: fix a missing-check bug

In yam_ioctl(), the concrete ioctl command is firstly copied from the
user-space buffer 'ifr->ifr_data' to 'ioctl_cmd' and checked through the
following switch statement. If the command is not as expected, an error
code EINVAL is returned. In the following execution the buffer
'ifr->ifr_data' is copied again in the cases of the switch statement to
specific data structures according to what kind of ioctl command is
requested. However, after the second copy, no re-check is enforced on the
newly-copied command. Given that the buffer 'ifr->ifr_data' is in the user
space, a malicious user can race to change the command between the two
copies. This way, the attacker can inject inconsistent data and cause
undefined behavior.

This patch adds a re-check in each case of the switch statement if there is
a second copy in that case, to re-check whether the command obtained in the
second copy is the same as the one in the first copy. If not, an error code
EINVAL will be returned.
