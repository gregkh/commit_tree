RDMA/cma: Consider netdevice for RoCE ports

When netdevice is not found for a request, and if it for RoCE port,
currently it allows matching the listener as long as port number matches
by ignoring the netdevice.

Now that we always prefer to have netdevice associated with RoCE, when
netdevice is not found, don't consider RoCE ports.

In other words, a NULL netdevice with RoCE is not acceptable. Therefore,
remove this confusing RoCE port ignorance check.
