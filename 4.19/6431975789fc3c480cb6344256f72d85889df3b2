iio: ad9523: support for external signals via gpios

The AD9523 supports external signals for power-down mode, resetting the
device and sync timing.
This change add support for specifying values for these signals via the
gpios and initializing them default values.

For the reset signal, the GPIO is toggled during probing to re-initialize
the device to a known state.
