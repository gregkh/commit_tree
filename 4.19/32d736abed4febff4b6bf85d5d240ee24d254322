x86/intel_rdt: Do not allow pseudo-locking of MBA resource

A system supporting pseudo-locking may have MBA as well as CAT
resources of which only the CAT resources could support cache
pseudo-locking. When the schemata to be pseudo-locked is provided it
should be checked that that schemata does not attempt to pseudo-lock a
MBA resource.
