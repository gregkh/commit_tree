scsi: libsas: dynamically allocate and free ata host

Commit 2623c7a5f2 ("libata: add refcounting to ata_host") v4.17+ introduced
refcounting to ata_host and will increase or decrease the refcount when
adding or deleting transport ATA port.

Now the ata host for libsas is embedded in domain_device, and the ->kref
member is not initialized. Afer we add ata transport class, ata_host_get()
will be called when adding transport ATA port and a warning will be
triggered as below:

refcount_t: increment on 0; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 103 at
lib/refcount.c:153 refcount_inc+0x40/0x48 ......  Call trace:

And also when removing transport ATA port ata_host_put() will be called and
another similar warning will be triggered. If the refcount decreased to
zero, the ata host will be freed. But this ata host is only part of
domain_device, it cannot be freed directly.

So we have to change this embedded static ata host to a dynamically
allocated ata host and initialize the ->kref member. To use ata_host_get()
and ata_host_put() in libsas, we need to move the declaration of these
functions to the public libata.h and export them.
