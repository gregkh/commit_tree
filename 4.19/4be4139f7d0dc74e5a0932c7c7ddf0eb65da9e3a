sctp: add support for setting flowlabel when adding a transport

Struct sockaddr_in6 has the member sin6_flowinfo that includes the
ipv6 flowlabel, it should also support for setting flowlabel when
adding a transport whose ipaddr is from userspace.

Note that addrinfo in sctp_sendmsg is using struct in6_addr for
the secondary addrs, which doesn't contain sin6_flowinfo, and
it needs to copy sin6_flowinfo from the primary addr.
