powerpc/64s: Rename STD_EXCEPTION_PSERIES to STD_EXCEPTION

The "PSERIES" in STD_EXCEPTION_PSERIES is to differentiate the macros
from the legacy iSeries versions, which are called
STD_EXCEPTION_ISERIES. It is not anything to do with pseries vs
powernv or powermac etc.

We removed the legacy iSeries code in 2012, in commit 8ee3e0d69623x
("powerpc: Remove the main legacy iSerie platform code").

So remove "PSERIES" from the macros.
