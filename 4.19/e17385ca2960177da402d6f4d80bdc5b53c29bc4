btrfs: remove unused member btrfs_root::name

Added in 58176a9604c ("Btrfs: Add per-root block accounting and sysfs
entries") in 2007, the roots had names exported in sysfs. The code
was commented out in 4df27c4d5cc1dda54ed ("Btrfs: change how subvolumes
are organized") and cleaned by 182608c8294b5fe9 ("btrfs: remove old
unused commented out code").
