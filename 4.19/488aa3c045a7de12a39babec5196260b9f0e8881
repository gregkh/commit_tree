ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: Remove legacy SMP fallback code

As of commit f89a51700d7ae0ef ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: Prioritize DT
APMU support") in v4.8, non-DT enablement of SMP was left as a fallback
for backwards compatibility with old DTBs.

The time has come to drop backwards compatibility, hence remove the
fallback code.
