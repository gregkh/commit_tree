rcu: Introduce grace-period sequence numbers

This commit adds grace-period sequence numbers (->gp_seq) to the
rcu_state, rcu_node, and rcu_data structures, and updates them.
It also checks for consistency between rsp->gpnum and rsp->gp_seq.
These ->gp_seq counters will eventually replace the existing ->gpnum
and ->completed counters, allowing a single memory access to determine
whether or not a grace period is in progress and if so, which one.
This in turn will enable changes that will reduce ->lock contention on
the leaf rcu_node structures.
