dt-bindings: net: cpsw: Document cpsw-phy-sel usage but prefer phandle

The current cpsw usage for cpsw-phy-sel is undocumented but is used for
all the boards using cpsw. And cpsw-phy-sel is not really a child of
the cpsw device, it lives in the system control module instead.

Let's document the existing usage, and improve it a bit where we prefer
to use a phandle instead of a child device for it. That way we can
properly describe the hardware in dts files for things like genpd.
