rcu: Improve RCU-tasks naming and comments

The naming and comments associated with some RCU-tasks code make
the faulty assumption that context switches due to cond_resched()
are voluntary.  As several people pointed out, this is not the case.
This commit therefore updates function names and comments to better
reflect current reality.
