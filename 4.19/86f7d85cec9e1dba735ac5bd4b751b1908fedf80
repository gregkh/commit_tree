tools: bpf: build and install man page for eBPF helpers from bpftool/

Provide a new Makefile.helpers in tools/bpf, in order to build and
install the man page for eBPF helpers. This Makefile is also included in
the one used to build bpftool documentation, so that it can be called
either on its own (cd tools/bpf && make -f Makefile.helpers) or from
bpftool directory (cd tools/bpf/bpftool && make doc, or
cd tools/bpf/bpftool/Documentation && make helpers).

Makefile.helpers is not added directly to bpftool to avoid changing its
Makefile too much (helpers are not 100% directly related with bpftool).
But the possibility to build the page from bpftool directory makes us
able to package the helpers man page with bpftool, and to install it
along with bpftool documentation, so that the doc for helpers becomes
easily available to developers through the "man" program.
