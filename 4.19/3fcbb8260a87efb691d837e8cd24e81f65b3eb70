He bisected to 84c6591103db ("locking/atomics,
asm-generic/bitops/lock.h: Rewrite using atomic_fetch_*()")

This commit however only unmasked the real issue introduced by commit
4aef66c8ae9 ("locking/atomic, arch/arc: Fix build") which missed the
retry-if-scond-failed branch in atomic_fetch_##op() macros.

The bisected commit started using atomic_fetch_##op() macros for building
the rest of atomics.

Fixes: 4aef66c8ae9 ("locking/atomic, arch/arc: Fix build")
