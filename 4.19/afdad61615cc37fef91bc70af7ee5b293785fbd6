KVM: s390: Fix storage attributes migration with memory slots

This is a fix for several issues that were found in the original code
for storage attributes migration.

Now no bitmap is allocated to keep track of dirty storage attributes;
the extra bits of the per-memslot bitmap that are always present anyway
are now used for this purpose.

The code has also been refactored a little to improve readability.
