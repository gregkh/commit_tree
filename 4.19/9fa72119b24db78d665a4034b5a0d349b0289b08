kvm: x86: Introduce kvm_mmu_calc_root_page_role()

These functions factor out the base role calculation from the
corresponding kvm_init_*_mmu() functions. The new functions return
what would be the role assigned to a root page in the current VCPU
state. This can be masked with mmu_base_role_mask to derive the base
role.
