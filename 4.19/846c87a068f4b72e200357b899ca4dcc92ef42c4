drm: mali-dp: Add support for writeback on DP550/DP650

Mali-DP display processors are able to write the composition result to a
memory buffer via the SE.

Add entry points in the HAL for enabling/disabling this feature, and
implement support for it on DP650 and DP550. DP500 acts differently and
so is omitted from this change.

Changes since v3:
 - Fix missing vsync interrupt for DP550
