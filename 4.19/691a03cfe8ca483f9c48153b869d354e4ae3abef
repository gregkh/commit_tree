USB: serial: io_ti: fix array underflow in completion handler

As reported by Dan Carpenter, a malicious USB device could set
port_number to a negative value and we would underflow the port array in
the interrupt completion handler.

As these devices only have one or two ports, fix this by making sure we
only consider the seventh bit when determining the port number (and
ignore bits 0xb0 which are typically set to 0x30).
