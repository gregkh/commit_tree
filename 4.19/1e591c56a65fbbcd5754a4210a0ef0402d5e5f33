brcmfmac: specify some features per firmware version

Some features supported by firmware aren't advertised and there is no
way for a driver to query them. This includes e.g. monitor mode details.

Most firmwares support monitor interface but only the latest ones
/announce/ it with a "monitor" flag in the "cap" iovar. There isn't any
reliable detection method for older firmwares (BRCMF_C_MONITOR was tried
but "it only indicates the core part of the stack supports").

Similarly support for tagging monitor frames and building radiotap
headers can't be reliably detected for all firmwares.

This commit adds table that allows mapping features to firmware version.
It adds mappings for 43602a1 and 4366b1 firmwares from
linux-firmware.git. Both were confirmed to be passing monitor frames.
