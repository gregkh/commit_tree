tracing: Fix synchronizing to event changes with tracepoint_synchronize_unregister()

Now that some trace events can be protected by srcu_read_lock(tracepoint_srcu),
we need to make sure all locations that depend on this are also protected.
There were many places that did a synchronize_sched() thinking that it was
enough to protect againts access to trace events. This use to be the case,
but now that we use SRCU for _rcuidle() trace events, they may not be
protected by synchronize_sched(), as they may be called in paths that RCU is
not watching for preempt disable.
