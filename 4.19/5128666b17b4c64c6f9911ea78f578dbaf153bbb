ARM: dts: imx51-zii-rdu1: correct touchscreen axis inversion

The RMI4 touchscreen driver applied inversion and axis swap in the
wrong order, violating the DT binding for those properties. This was fixed in
645a397, so correct the RDU1 DT to apply the inversion to the
correct axis.

Tested on Zii RDU1 00-5105-30 rev B
