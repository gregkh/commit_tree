selftests/bpf: Test sys_connect BPF hooks with TFO

TCP Fast Open is triggered by sys_sendmsg with MSG_FASTOPEN flag for
SOCK_STREAM socket.

Even though it's sys_sendmsg, it eventually calls __inet_stream_connect
the same way sys_connect does for TCP.  __inet_stream_connect, in turn,
already has BPF hooks for sys_connect.

That means TFO is already covered by BPF_CGROUP_INET{4,6}_CONNECT and
the only missing piece is selftest. The patch adds selftest for TFO.
