xfrm: reset transport header back to network header after all input transforms ahave been applied

A policy may have been set up with multiple transforms (e.g., ESP
and ipcomp). In this situation, the ingress IPsec processing
iterates in xfrm_input() and applies each transform in turn,
processing the nexthdr to find any additional xfrm that may apply.

This patch resets the transport header back to network header
only after the last transformation so that subsequent xfrms
can find the correct transport header.
