staging: gasket: remove "reset type" param from framework

The "type of reset" parameter to the gasket device reset APIs isn't
required by the only gasket device submitted upstream, apex.

The framework documents the param as private to the device driver and a
pass-through at the gasket layer, but the gasket core calls the device
driver with a hardcoded reset type of zero, which is not documented as
having a predefined meaning.

In light of all this, remove the reset type parameter from the
framework.  Remove the reset ioctl reset type parameter, and bump the
framework version number to reflect the interface change.
