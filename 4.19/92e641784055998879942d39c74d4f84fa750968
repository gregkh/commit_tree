s/epoll: robustify irq safety with lockdep_assert_irqs_enabled()

Sprinkle lockdep_assert_irqs_enabled() checks in the functions that do not
save and restore interrupts when dealing with the ep->wq.lock.  These are
ep_scan_ready_list() and those called by epoll_ctl(): ep_insert, ep_modify
and ep_remove.
