mm/swapfile.c: put_swap_page: share more between huge/normal code path

In this patch, locking related code is shared between huge/normal code
path in put_swap_page() to reduce code duplication. The `free_entries == 0`
case is merged into the more general `free_entries != SWAPFILE_CLUSTER`
case, because the new locking method makes it easy.

The added lines is same as the removed lines.  But the code size is
increased when CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=n.

		text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
base:	       24123	   2004	    340	  26467	   6763	mm/swapfile.o
unified:       24485	   2004	    340	  26829	   68cd	mm/swapfile.o

Dig on step deeper with `size -A mm/swapfile.o` for base and unified
kernel and compare the result, yields,

  -.text                                17723      0
  +.text                                17835      0
  -.orc_unwind_ip                        1380      0
  +.orc_unwind_ip                        1480      0
  -.orc_unwind                           2070      0
  +.orc_unwind                           2220      0
  -Total                                26686
  +Total                                27048

The total difference is the same.  The text segment difference is much
smaller: 112.  More difference comes from the ORC unwinder segments:
(1480 + 2220) - (1380 + 2070) = 250.  If the frame pointer unwinder is
used, this costs nothing.
