ALSA: usb-audio: Fix multiple definitions in AU0828_DEVICE() macro

AU0828_DEVICE() macro in quirks-table.h uses USB_DEVICE_VENDOR_SPEC()
for expanding idVendor and idProduct fields.  However, the latter
macro adds also match_flags and bInterfaceClass, which are different
from the values AU0828_DEVICE() macro sets after that.

For fixing them, just expand idVendor and idProduct fields manually in
AU0828_DEVICE().

This fixes sparse warnings like:
  sound/usb/quirks-table.h:2892:1: warning: Initializer entry defined twice
