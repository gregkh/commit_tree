ovl: Modify ovl_lookup() and friends to lookup metacopy dentry

This patch modifies ovl_lookup() and friends to lookup metacopy dentries.
It also allows for presence of metacopy dentries in lower layer.

During lookup, check for presence of OVL_XATTR_METACOPY and if not present,
set OVL_UPPERDATA bit in flags.

We don't support metacopy feature with nfs_export.  So in nfs_export code,
we set OVL_UPPERDATA flag set unconditionally if upper inode exists.

Do not follow metacopy origin if we find a metacopy only inode and metacopy
feature is not enabled for that mount.  Like redirect, this can have
security implications where an attacker could hand craft upper and try to
gain access to file on lower which it should not have to begin with.
