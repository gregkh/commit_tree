MIPS: Delete unused code in linux32.c

The A() & AA() macros have been unused since commit 05e4396651ca
("[MIPS] Use SYSVIPC_COMPAT to fix various problems on N32"), which
switched to the more standard compat_ptr().

RLIM_INFINITY32, RESOURCE32() & struct rlimit32 have been present but
unused since the beginning of the git era.

Remove the dead code.
