checkpatch: add a --strict test for structs with bool member definitions

A struct with a bool member can have different sizes on various
architectures because neither bool size nor alignment is standardized.

So emit a message on the use of bool in structs only in .h files and not
.c files.

There is the real possibility that this test could have a false positive
when a bool is declared as an automatic, so limit the test to .h files
where the only false positive is for declarations in static inline
functions.
