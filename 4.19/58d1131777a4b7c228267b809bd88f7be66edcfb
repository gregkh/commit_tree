iommu: Add config option to set passthrough as default

This allows the default behavior to be controlled by a kernel config
option instead of changing the commandline for the kernel to include
"iommu.passthrough=on" or "iommu=pt" on machines where this is desired.

Likewise, for machines where this config option is enabled, it can be
disabled at boot time with "iommu.passthrough=off" or "iommu=nopt".

Also corrected iommu=pt documentation for IA-64, since it has no code that
parses iommu= at all.
