kvm: x86: Set highest physical address bits in non-present/reserved SPTEs

Always set the 5 upper-most supported physical address bits to 1 for SPTEs
that are marked as non-present or reserved, to make them unusable for
L1TF attacks from the guest. Currently, this just applies to MMIO SPTEs.
(We do not need to mark PTEs that are completely 0 as physical page 0
is already reserved.)

This allows mitigation of L1TF without disabling hyper-threading by using
shadow paging mode instead of EPT.
