SMB3: Number of requests sent should be displayed for SMB3 not just CIFS

For SMB2/SMB3 the number of requests sent was not displayed
in /proc/fs/cifs/Stats unless CONFIG_CIFS_STATS2 was
enabled (only number of failed requests displayed). As
with earlier dialects, we should be displaying these
counters if CONFIG_CIFS_STATS is enabled. They
are important for debugging.

e.g. when you cat /proc/fs/cifs/Stats (before the patch)
