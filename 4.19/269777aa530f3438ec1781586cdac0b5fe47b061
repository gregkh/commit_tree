cpu/hotplug: Non-SMP machines do not make use of booted_once

Commit 0cc3cd21657b ("cpu/hotplug: Boot HT siblings at least once")
breaks non-SMP builds.

[ I suspect the 'bool' fields should just be made to be bitfields and be
  exposed regardless of configuration, but that's a separate cleanup
  that I'll leave to the owners of this file for later.   - Linus ]
