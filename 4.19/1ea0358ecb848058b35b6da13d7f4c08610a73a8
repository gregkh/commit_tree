ALSA: usb-audio: Generic DSD detection for Thesycon-based implementations

Thesycon provides solutions to XMOS chips, and has its own device
vendor id.

In this patch, we use generic method to detect DSD capability of
Thesycon-based UAC2 implementations in order to support a wide range
of current and future devices.

The patch will enable the SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_DSD_U32_BE bit for the DAC
hence enable native DSD playback up to DSD512 format.
