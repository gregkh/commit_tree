net: qla3xxx: Remove overflowing shift statement

Clang currently warns:

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qla3xxx.c:384:24: warning: signed shift
result (0xF00000000) requires 37 bits to represent, but 'int' only has
32 bits [-Wshift-overflow]
                    ((ISP_NVRAM_MASK << 16) | qdev->eeprom_cmd_data));
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^  ~~
1 warning generated.

The warning is certainly accurate since ISP_NVRAM_MASK is defined as
(0x000F << 16) which is then shifted by 16, resulting in 64424509440,
well above UINT_MAX.

Given that this is the only location in this driver where ISP_NVRAM_MASK
is shifted again, it seems likely that ISP_NVRAM_MASK was originally
defined without a shift and during the move of the shift to the
definition, this statement wasn't properly removed (since ISP_NVRAM_MASK
is used in the statenent right above this). Only the maintainers can
confirm this since this statment has been here since the driver was
first added to the kernel.
