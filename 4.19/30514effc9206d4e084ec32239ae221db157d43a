x86/mm/pti: Don't clear permissions in pti_clone_pmd()

The function sets the global-bit on cloned PMD entries, which only makes
sense when the permissions are identical between the user and the kernel
page-table. Further, only write-permissions are cleared for entry-text and
kernel-text sections, which are not writeable at the end of the boot
process.

The reason why this RW clearing exists is that in the early PTI
implementations the cloned kernel areas were set up during early boot
before the kernel text is set to read only and not touched afterwards.

This is not longer true. The cloned areas are still set up early to get the
entry code working for interrupts and other things, but after the kernel
text has been set RO the clone is repeated which copies the RO PMD/PTEs
over to the user visible clone. That means the initial clearing of the
writable bit can be avoided.
