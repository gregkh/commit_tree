NFSD: Handle full-length symlinks

I've given up on the idea of zero-copy handling of SYMLINK on the
server side. This is because the Linux VFS symlink API requires the
symlink pathname to be in a NUL-terminated kmalloc'd buffer. The
NUL-termination is going to be problematic (watching out for
landing on a page boundary and dealing with a 4096-byte pathname).

I don't believe that SYMLINK creation is on a performance path or is
requested frequently enough that it will cause noticeable CPU cache
pollution due to data copies.

There will be two places where a transport callout will be necessary
to fill in the rqstp: one will be in the svc_fill_symlink_pathname()
helper that is used by NFSv2 and NFSv3, and the other will be in
nfsd4_decode_create().
