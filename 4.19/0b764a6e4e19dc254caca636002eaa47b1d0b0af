srcu: Add notrace variant of srcu_dereference

In the last patch in this series, we are making lockdep register hooks
onto the irq_{disable,enable} tracepoints. These tracepoints use the
_rcuidle tracepoint variant. In this series we switch the _rcuidle
tracepoint callers to use SRCU instead of sched-RCU. Inorder to
dereference the pointer to the probe functions, we could call
srcu_dereference, however this API will call back into lockdep to check
if the lock is held *before* the lockdep probe hooks have a chance to
run and annotate the IRQ enabled/disabled state.

For this reason we need a notrace variant of srcu_dereference since
otherwise we get lockdep splats. This patch adds the needed
srcu_dereference_notrace variant.
