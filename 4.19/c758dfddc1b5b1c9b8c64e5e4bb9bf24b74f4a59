net/smc: add SMC-D support in CLC messages

There are two types of SMC: SMC-R and SMC-D. These types are signaled
within the CLC messages during the CLC handshake. This patch adds
support for and checks of the SMC type.

Also, SMC-R and SMC-D need to exchange different information during the
CLC handshake. So, this patch extends the current message formats to
support the SMC-D header fields. The Proposal message can contain both
SMC-R and SMC-D information. The Accept and Confirm messages contain
either SMC-R or SMC-D information.
