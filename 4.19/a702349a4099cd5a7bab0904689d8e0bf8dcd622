s390/qeth: fix race in used-buffer accounting

By updating q->used_buffers only _after_ do_QDIO() has completed, there
is a potential race against the buffer's TX completion. In the unlikely
case that the TX completion path wins, qeth_qdio_output_handler() would
decrement the counter before qeth_flush_buffers() even incremented it.
