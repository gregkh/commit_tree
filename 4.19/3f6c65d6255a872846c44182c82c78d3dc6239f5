tcp: ignore rcv_rtt sample with old ts ecr value

When receiving multiple packets with the same ts ecr value, only try
to compute rcv_rtt sample with the earliest received packet.
This is because the rcv_rtt calculated by later received packets
could possibly include long idle time or other types of delay.
For example:
(1) server sends last packet of reply with TS val V1
(2) client ACKs last packet of reply with TS ecr V1
(3) long idle time passes
(4) client sends next request data packet with TS ecr V1 (again!)
At this time, the rcv_rtt computed on server with TS ecr V1 will be
inflated with the idle time and should get ignored.
