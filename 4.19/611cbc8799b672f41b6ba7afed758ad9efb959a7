ASoC: core: remove support for card rebind using component framework

DRM based audio components get registered inside the component framework
bind callback. However component framework has a big mutex lock taken for
every call to component_add, component_del and bind, unbind callbacks.

This can lead to deadlock situation if we are trying to add new/remove
component within a bind/unbind callbacks. Which is what was happening
with bcm2837 rpi 3.

Revert this change till we sort out the mutex issue.
