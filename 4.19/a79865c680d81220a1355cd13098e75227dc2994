btrfs: Remove V0 extent support

The v0 compat code was introduced in commit 5d4f98a28c7d
("Btrfs: Mixed back reference  (FORWARD ROLLING FORMAT CHANGE)") 9
years ago, which was merged in 2.6.31. This means that the code is
there to support filesystems which are _VERY_ old and if you are using
btrfs on such an old kernel, you have much bigger problems. This coupled
with the fact that no one is likely testing/maintining this code likely
means it has bugs lurking. All things considered I think 43 kernel
releases later it's high time this remnant of the past got removed.

This patch removes all code wrapped in #ifdefs but leaves the BUG_ONs in case
we have a v0 with no support intact as a sort of safety-net.
