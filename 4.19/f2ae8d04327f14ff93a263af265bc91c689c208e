scsi: hisi_sas: Release all remaining resources in clear nexus ha

In host reset, we use TMF or soft-reset to re-init device, and if success,
we will release all LLDD resources of this device. If the init fails -
maybe because the device was removed or link has not come up - then do not
release the LLDD resources, but rather rely on SCSI EH to handle the
timeout for these resources later on.

But if clear nexus ha calls host reset, which is the last effort of SCSI
EH, we should release all LLDD remain resources. Because SCSI EH will
release all tasks after clear nexus ha.

Before release, we do I_T nexus reset to try to clear target remain IOs.
