kconfig: improve the recursive dependency report

This commit improves the messages of the recursive dependency.
Currently, sym->dir_dep.expr is not checked.  Hence, any dependency
in property visibility is regarded as the dependency of the symbol.

[Test Code 1]

  config A
          bool "a"
          depends on B

  config B
          bool "b"
          depends on A

[Test Code 2]

  config A
          bool "a" if B

  config B
          bool "b"
          depends on A

For both cases above, the same message is displayed:

        symbol B depends on A
        symbol A depends on B

This commit changes the message for the latter, like this:

        symbol B depends on A
        symbol A prompt is visible depending on B

Also, 'select' and 'imply' are distinguished.
