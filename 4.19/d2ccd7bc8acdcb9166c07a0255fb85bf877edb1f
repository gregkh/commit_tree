tcp: avoid resetting ACK timer in DCTCP

The recent fix of acking immediately in DCTCP on CE status change
has an undesirable side-effect: it also resets TCP ack timer and
disables pingpong mode (interactive session). But the CE status
change has nothing to do with them. This patch addresses that by
using the new one-time immediate ACK flag instead of calling
tcp_enter_quickack_mode().
