fs/sysv/inode.c: use ktime_get_real_seconds() for superblock stamp

get_seconds() is deprecated in favor of ktime_get_real_seconds(), which
returns a 64-bit timestamp.

In the SYSV file system, the superblock timestamp is only 32 bits wide,
and it is used to check whether a file system is clean, so the best
solution seems to be to force a wraparound and explicitly convert it to an
unsigned 32-bit value.

This is independent of the inode timestamps that are also 32-bit wide on
disk and that come from current_time().
