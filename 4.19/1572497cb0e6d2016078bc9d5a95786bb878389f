kconfig: include common Kconfig files from top-level Kconfig

Instead of duplicating the source statements in every architecture just
do it once in the toplevel Kconfig file.

Note that with this the inclusion of arch/$(SRCARCH/Kconfig moves out of
the top-level Kconfig into arch/Kconfig so that don't violate ordering
constraits while keeping a sensible menu structure.
