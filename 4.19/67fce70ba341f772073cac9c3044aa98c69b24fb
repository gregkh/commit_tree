f2fs: disable f2fs_check_rb_tree_consistence

If there is millions of discard entries cached in rb tree, each
sanity check of it can cause very long latency as held cmd_lock
blocking other lock grabbers.

In other aspect, we have enabled the check very long time, as
we see, there is no such inconsistent condition caused by bugs.

But still we do not choose to kill it directly, instead, adding
an flag to disable the check now, if there is related code change,
we can reuse it to detect bugs.
