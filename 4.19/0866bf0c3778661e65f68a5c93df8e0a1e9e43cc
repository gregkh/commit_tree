nvmet: add commands supported and effects log page

This patch adds support for Commands Supported and Effects log page
(Log Identifier 05h) for NVMeOF. This also makes it easier to find
which commands are supported, e.g. :-

subnqn    : testnqn1
Admin Command Set
ACS2     [Get Log Page                    ] 00000001
ACS6     [Identify                        ] 00000001
ACS8     [Abort                           ] 00000001
ACS9     [Set Features                    ] 00000001
ACS10    [Get Features                    ] 00000001
ACS12    [Asynchronous Event Request      ] 00000001
ACS24    [Keep Alive                      ] 00000001

NVM Command Set
IOCS0    [Flush                           ] 00000001
IOCS1    [Write                           ] 00000001
IOCS2    [Read                            ] 00000001
IOCS8    [Write Zeroes                    ] 00000001
IOCS9    [Dataset Management              ] 00000001

This partticular functionality can be used from the host side to examine
the NVMeOF ctrl commands supported.
