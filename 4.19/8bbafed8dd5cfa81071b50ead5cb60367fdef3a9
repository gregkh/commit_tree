dmaengine: mv_xor_v2: kill the tasklets upon exit

The mv_xor_v2 driver uses a tasklet, initialized during the probe()
routine. However, it forgets to cleanup the tasklet using
tasklet_kill() function during the remove() routine, which this patch
fixes. This prevents the tasklet from potentially running after the
module has been removed.
