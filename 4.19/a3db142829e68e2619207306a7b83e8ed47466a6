drm/i915/psr: Set idle frame count based on sink synchronization latency

DPCD 2009h "Synchronization latency in sink" has bits that tell us the
maximum number of frames sink can take to resynchronize to source timing
when exiting PSR. More importantly, as per eDP 1.4b, this is the "Minimum
number of frames following PSR exit that the Source device needs to
wait for PSR entry."

We currently use this value only to setup the number frames to wait before
PSR2 selective update. But, based on the above description it makes more
sense to use this to configure idle frames for both PSR1 and and PSR2. This
will ensure we wait the required number of frames before
activation whether it is PSR1 or PSR2.

The minimum number of idle frames remains 6, while allowing sink
synchronization latency and VBT to increase this value.

This also solves the flip-flop between sink and source frames that I
noticed on my Thinkpad X260 during PSR exit. This specific panel has a
value of 8h, which according to the spec means the "Source device must
wait for more than eight active frames after PSR exit before initiating PSR
entry. (In this case, should be provided by the panel supplier.)" VBT
however has a value of 0.
