nfp: restore correct ordering of fields in rx ring structure

Commit 7f1c684a8966 ("nfp: setup xdp_rxq_info") mixed the cache
cold and cache hot data in the nfp_net_rx_ring structure (ignoring
the feedback), to try to fit the structure into 2 cache lines
after struct xdp_rxq_info was added.  Now that we are about to add
a new field the structure will grow back to 3 cache lines, so
order the members correctly.
