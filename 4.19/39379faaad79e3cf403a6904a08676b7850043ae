btrfs: revert fs_devices state on error of btrfs_init_new_device

When btrfs hits error after modifying fs_devices in
btrfs_init_new_device() (such as btrfs_add_dev_item() returns error), it
leaves everything as is, but frees allocated btrfs_device. As a result,
fs_devices->devices and fs_devices->alloc_list contain already freed
btrfs_device, leading to later use-after-free bug.

Error path also messes the things like ->num_devices. While they go back
to the original value by unscanning btrfs devices, it is safe to revert
them here.
