staging: rtsx: remove rtsx_trace() and related code

The driver has rather excessive amount of tracing code, which would be
better done using ftrace. This is obviously not a main feature of the
driver, and it should work just as well without it.

Removing it saves over 1300 lines of code and likely makes the driver
a bit faster by avoiding lots of calls into the timekeeping code.

I came across this while cleaning up the last users of the deprecated
getnstimeofday64() function, of which there is one in the now-removed
get_current_time() function of the rtsx driver that was only used for
tracing.
