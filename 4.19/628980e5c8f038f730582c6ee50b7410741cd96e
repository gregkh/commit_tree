mac80211_hwsim: fix locking when iterating radios during ns exit

The cleanup of radios during namespace exit has recently been reworked
to directly delete a radio while temporarily releasing the spinlock,
fixing a race condition between the work-queue execution and namespace
exits. However, the temporary unlock allows unsafe modifications on the
iterated list, resulting in a potential crash when continuing the
iteration of additional radios.

Move radios about to destroy to a temporary list, and clean that up
after releasing the spinlock once iteration is complete.
