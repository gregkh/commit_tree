rcu: Print stall-warning NMI dyntick state in hexadecimal

The ->dynticks_nmi_nesting field records the nesting depth of both
interrupt and NMI handlers.  Because the kernel can enter interrupts
and never leave them (and vice versa) and because NMIs can interrupt
manipulation of the ->dynticks_nmi_nesting field, the values in this
field must be both chosen and maniupated very carefully.  As a result,
although the value is zero when the corresponding CPU is executing
neither an interrupt nor an NMI handler, it is 4,611,686,018,427,387,906
on 64-bit systems when there is a single level of interrupt/NMI handling
in progress.

This number is difficult to remember and interpret, so this commit
switches the output to hexadecimal, resulting in the much nicer
0x4000000000000002.
