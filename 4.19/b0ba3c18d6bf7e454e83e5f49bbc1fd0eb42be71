IB/hfi1: Move normal functions from hfi1_devdata to const array

The current implementation precludes having receive context specific
packet type receive handlers.

Fix this by adding adding c99 const array for the existing handlers and
remove the current 72 bytes of pointers from devdata.

A new pointer in hfi1_ctxtdata will point to the const array.
