IB/uverbs: Revise and clarify the rwsem and uobjects_lock

Rename 'cleanup_rwsem' to 'hw_destroy_rwsem' which is held across any call
to the type destroy function (aka 'hw' destroy). The main purpose of this
lock is to prevent normal add and destroy from running concurrently with
uverbs_cleanup_ufile()

Since the uobjects list is always manipulated under the 'hw_destroy_rwsem'
we can eliminate the uobjects_lock in the cleanup function. This allows
converting that lock to a very simple spinlock with a narrow critical
section.
