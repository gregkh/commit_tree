ACPI / OSI: Add OEM _OSI string to enable NVidia HDMI audio

Some ThinkPad systems have a power-saving feature that turns off HDMI
audio device in Windows, but NVidia Linux driver does not support this
feature. As a result, HDMI audio will not work on Linux.

A BIOS workaround is added with an OEM_OSI string
"Linux-Lenovo-NV-HDMI-Audio" to power on NVidia HDMI audio when booting.

The form of the OEM _OSI strings is defined by each OEMs and is
discussed in Documentation/acpi/osi.txt.
