parisc: Fix and improve kernel stack unwinding

This patchset fixes and improves stack unwinding a lot:
1. Show backward stack traces with up to 30 callsites
2. Add callinfo to ENTRY_CFI() such that every assembler function will get an
   entry in the unwind table
3. Use constants instead of numbers in call_on_stack()
4. Do not depend on CONFIG_KALLSYMS to generate backtraces.
5. Speed up backtrace generation

Make sure you have this patch to GNU as installed:

Without this patch, unwind info in the kernel is often wrong for various
functions.
