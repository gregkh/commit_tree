i2c: designware: Move SDA hold time configuration to common code

SDA hold time configuration is common to both master and slave code. It
is also something that can be done once during probe and do only
register write when HW needs to be reinitialized.

Remove duplication and move SDA hold time configuration to common code.
It will be called from slave probe and for master code from a new
i2c_dw_set_timings_master() to where we will populate more probe time
timing parameter setting.
