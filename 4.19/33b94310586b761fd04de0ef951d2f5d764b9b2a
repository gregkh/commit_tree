nfp: bpf: copy range info for all operands of all ALU operations

NFP verifier hook is coping range information of the shift amount for
indirect shift operation so optimized shift sequences could be generated.

We want to use range info to do more things. For example, to decide whether
multiplication and divide are supported on the given range.

This patch simply let NFP verifier hook to copy range info for all operands
of all ALU operands.
