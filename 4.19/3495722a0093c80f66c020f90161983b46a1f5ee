coresight: tmc: Hide trace buffer handling for file read

At the moment we adjust the buffer pointers for reading the trace
data via misc device in the common code for ETF/ETB and ETR. Since
we are going to change how we manage the buffer for ETR, let us
move the buffer manipulation to the respective driver files, hiding
it from the common code. We do so by adding type specific helpers
for finding the length of data and the pointer to the buffer,
for a given length at a file position.
