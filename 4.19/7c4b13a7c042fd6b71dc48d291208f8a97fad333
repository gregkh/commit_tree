s390/mm: Add gmap pmd notification bit setting

Like for ptes, we also need invalidation notification for pmds, to
make sure the guest lowcore pages are always accessible and later
addition of shadowed pmds.

With PMDs we do not have PGSTEs or some other bits we could use in the
host PMD. Instead we pick one of the free bits in the gmap PMD. Every
time a host pmd will be invalidated, we will check if the respective
gmap PMD has the bit set and in that case fire up the notifier.
