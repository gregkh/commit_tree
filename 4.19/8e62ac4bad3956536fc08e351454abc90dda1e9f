soc: mediatek: pwrap: add pwrap driver for mt6797 SoCs

mt6797 is a highly integrated SoCs, it uses mt6351 for power management.
This patch adds pwrap driver to access mt6351. Pwrap of mt6797 support
dynamic priority meichanism, sequence monitor and starvation mechanism
to make transaction more reliable.

A big change from V4 to V5 is we remove INT1 interrupt declaration since
it is only for debug purpose. The PWRAP_RDDMY, RESET and DCM can use legacy
setting, it is backwards compatible. The new caps flag declaration is not
needed, just remove it.
