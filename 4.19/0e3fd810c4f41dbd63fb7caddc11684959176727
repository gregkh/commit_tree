Documentation: document ktime_get_*() APIs

As Dave Chinner points out, we don't have a proper documentation for the
ktime_get() family of interfaces, making it rather unclear which of the
over 30 (!) interfaces one should actually use in a driver or elsewhere
in the kernel.

I wrote up an explanation from how I personally see the interfaces,
documenting what each of the functions do and hopefully making it a bit
clearer which should be used where.

This is the first time I tried writing .rst format documentation, so
in addition to any mistakes in the content, I probably also introduce
nonstandard formatting ;-)

I first tried to add an extra section to
Documentation/timers/timekeeping.txt, but this is currently not included
in the generated API, and it seems useful to have the API docs as part
of what gets generated in
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/index.html#core-utilities
instead, so I started a new file there.

I also considered adding the documentation inline in the
include/linux/timekeeping.h header, but couldn't figure out how to do
that in a way that would result both in helpful inline comments as
well as readable html output, so I settled for the latter, with
a small note pointing to it from the header.
