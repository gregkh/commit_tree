clocksource/drivers: Set clockevent device cpumask to cpu_possible_mask

Currently, quite a few clockevent devices have cpumask set to
cpu_all_mask which should be fine. However, cpu_possible_mask is more
accurate and if there are any other clockevent devices in the system
which have cpumask set to cpu_possible_mask, then having cpu_all_mask
may result in issues (mostly boot hang with forever loops in
clockevents_notify_released).

So, lets replace all the clockevent device cpu_all_mask to
cpu_possible_mask in order to prevent above mentioned possible issue.
