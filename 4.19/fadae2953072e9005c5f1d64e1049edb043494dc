thp: use mm_file_counter to determine update which rss counter

Since commit eca56ff906bd ("mm, shmem: add internal shmem resident
memory accounting"), MM_SHMEMPAGES is added to separate the shmem
accounting from regular files.  So, all shmem pages should be accounted
to MM_SHMEMPAGES instead of MM_FILEPAGES.

And, normal 4K shmem pages have been accounted to MM_SHMEMPAGES, so
shmem thp pages should be not treated differently.  Account them to
MM_SHMEMPAGES via mm_counter_file() since shmem pages are swap backed to
keep consistent with normal 4K shmem pages.

This will not change the rss counter of processes since shmem pages are
still a part of it.

The /proc/pid/status and /proc/pid/statm counters will however be more
accurate wrt shmem usage, as originally intended.  And as eca56ff906bd
("mm, shmem: add internal shmem resident memory accounting") mentioned,
oom also could report more accurate "shmem-rss".
