staging: gasket: page table: fix function param line continuation style

Fix multi-line alignment formatting to look like:
      int ret = long_function_name(device, VARIABLE1, VARIABLE2,
                                   VARIABLE3, VARIABLE4);

Many of these TODO items were previously cleaned up during the conversion
to standard logging functions.
