spi: imx: Use correct number of bytes per words

The SPI core enforces that we always use the next power-of-two number of
bytes to store words. As a result, a 24 bits word will be stored in 4
bytes.

This commit fixes the spi_imx_bytes_per_word function to return the
correct number of bytes.

This also allows to get rid of unnecessary checks in the can_dma
function, since the SPI core validates that we always have a transfer
length that is a multiple of the number of bytes per word.
