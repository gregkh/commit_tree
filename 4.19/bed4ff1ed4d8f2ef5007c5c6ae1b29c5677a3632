i2c: imx: Fix race condition in dma read

This fixes a race condition, where the DMAEN bit ends up being set after
I2C slave has transmitted a byte following the dummy read.  When that
happens, an interrupt is generated instead, and no DMA request is generated
to kickstart the DMA read, and a timeout happens after DMA_TIMEOUT (1 sec).

Fixed by setting the DMAEN bit before the dummy read.
