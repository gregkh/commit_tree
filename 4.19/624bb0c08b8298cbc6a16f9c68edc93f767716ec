drm/v3d: Delay the scheduler timeout if we're still making progress.

GTF-GLES2.gtf.GL.acos.acos_float_vert_xvary submits jobs that take 4
seconds at maximum resolution, but we still want to reset quickly if a
job is really hung.  Sample the CL's current address and the return
address (since we call into tile lists repeatedly) and if either has
changed then assume we've made progress.
