block: move dif_prepare/dif_complete functions to block layer

Currently these functions are implemented in the scsi layer, but their
actual place should be the block layer since T10-PI is a general data
integrity feature that is used in the nvme protocol as well. Also, use
the tuple size from the integrity profile since it may vary between
integrity types.
