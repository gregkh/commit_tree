perf/hw_breakpoint: Enable breakpoint in modify_user_hw_breakpoint

Currently we enable the breakpoint back only if the breakpoint
modification was successful. If it fails we can leave the breakpoint in
disabled state with attr->disabled == 0.

We can safely enable the breakpoint back for both the fail and success
paths by checking the bp->attr.disabled, which either holds the new
'requested' disabled state or the original breakpoint state.
