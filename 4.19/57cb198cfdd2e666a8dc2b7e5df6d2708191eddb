KVM: s390: Beautify skey enable check

Let's introduce an explicit check if skeys have already been enabled
for the vcpu, so we don't have to check the mm context if we don't have
the storage key facility.

This lets us check for enablement without having to take the mm
semaphore and thus speedup skey emulation.
