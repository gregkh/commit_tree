net: sched: don't dump chains only held by actions

In case a chain is empty and not explicitly created by a user,
such chain should not exist. The only exception is if there is
an action "goto chain" pointing to it. In that case, don't show the
chain in the dump. Track the chain references held by actions and
use them to find out if a chain should or should not be shown
in chain dump.
