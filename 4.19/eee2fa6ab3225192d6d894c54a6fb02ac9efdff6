rds: Changing IP address internal representation to struct in6_addr

This patch changes the internal representation of an IP address to use
struct in6_addr.  IPv4 address is stored as an IPv4 mapped address.
All the functions which take an IP address as argument are also
changed to use struct in6_addr.  But RDS socket layer is not modified
such that it still does not accept IPv6 address from an application.
And RDS layer does not accept nor initiate IPv6 connections.

v2: Fixed sparse warnings.
