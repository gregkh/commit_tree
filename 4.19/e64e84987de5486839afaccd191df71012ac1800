platform/x86: Add ACPI i2c-multi-instantiate pseudo driver

On systems with ACPI instantiated i2c-clients, normally there is 1 fw_node
per i2c-device and that fw-node contains 1 I2cSerialBus resource for that 1
i2c-device.

But in some rare cases the manufacturer has decided to describe multiple
i2c-devices in a single ACPI fwnode with multiple I2cSerialBus resources.

An earlier attempt to fix this in the i2c-core resulted in a lot of extra
code to support this corner-case.

This commit introduces a new i2c-multi-instantiate driver which fixes this
in a different way. This new driver can be built as a module which will
only loaded on affected systems.

This driver will instantiate a new i2c-client per I2cSerialBus resource,
using the driver_data from the acpi_device_id it is binding to to tell it
which chip-type (and optional irq-resource) to use when instantiating.

Note this driver depends on a platform device being instantiated for the
ACPI fwnode, see the i2c_multi_instantiate_ids list of ACPI device-ids in
drivers/acpi/scan.c: acpi_device_enumeration_by_parent().
