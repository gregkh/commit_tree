vmw_balloon: remove inflation rate limiting

Since commit 33d268ed0019 ("VMware balloon: Do not limit the amount of
frees and allocations in non-sleep mode."), the allocations are not
increased, and therefore balloon inflation rate limiting is in practice
broken.

While we can restore rate limiting, in practice we see that it can
result in adverse effect, as the hypervisor throttles down the VM if it
does not respond well enough, or alternatively causes it to perform very
poorly as the host swaps out the VM memory. Throttling the VM down can
even have a cascading effect, in which the VM reclaims memory even
slower and consequentially throttled down even further.

We therefore remove all the rate limiting mechanisms, including the slow
allocation cycles, as they are likely to do more harm than good.

Fixes: 33d268ed0019 ("VMware balloon: Do not limit the amount of frees and allocations in non-sleep mode.")
