drm/amd/display: allow diags to skip initial link training

[why]
diag specify what the full config and is only concerned about pass/fail at the end

having inter-op code like verifiying we can actually train at reported link rate
slows down diag test and add complexity we don't need

[how]
add dc_debug option to skip capability link trianing

also  remove hbr in function name as verify is not specific to hbr
