scsi: scsi_debug: add cmd abort option to every_nth

This patch is motivated by a response in the thread:

  Re: [PATCH 0/5]stop normal completion path entering a timeout req

by Jianchao Wang . It generalizes the error injection of
blk_abort_request() to use scsi_debug's "every_nth" mechanism.  Ref with
original patch to scsi_debug:

Also convert two vmalloc/memset(0) to vzalloc() calls.
