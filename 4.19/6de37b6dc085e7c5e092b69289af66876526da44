pass creds to get_empty_filp(), make sure dentry_open() passes the right creds

... and rename get_empty_filp() to alloc_empty_file().

dentry_open() gets creds as argument, but the only thing that sees those is
security_file_open() - file->f_cred still ends up with current_cred().  For
almost all callers it's the same thing, but there are several broken cases.
