btrfs: check-integrity: Fix NULL pointer dereference for degraded mount

Commit f8f84b2dfda5 ("btrfs: index check-integrity state hash by a dev_t")
changed how btrfsic indexes device state.

Now we need to access device->bdev->bd_dev, while for degraded mount
it's completely possible to have device->bdev as NULL, thus it will
trigger a NULL pointer dereference at mount time.

Fix it by checking if the device is degraded before accessing
device->bdev->bd_dev.

There are a lot of other places accessing device->bdev->bd_dev, however
the other call sites have either checked device->bdev, or the
device->bdev is passed from btrfsic_map_block(), so it won't cause harm.
