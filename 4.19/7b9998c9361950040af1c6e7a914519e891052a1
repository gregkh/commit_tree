media: ov772x: make set_fmt() and s_frame_interval() return -EBUSY while streaming

The ov772x driver is going to offer a V4L2 sub-device interface, so
changing the output data format and the frame interval on this sub-device
can be made anytime.  However, these requests are preferred to fail while
the video stream on the device is active.
