mm/swap_slots.c: make swap_slots_cache_mutex and swap_slots_cache_enable_mutex static

The mutexes swap_slots_cache_mutex and swap_slots_cache_enable_mutex are
local to the source and do not need to be in global scope, so make them
static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
  symbol 'swap_slots_cache_mutex' was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol 'swap_slots_cache_enable_mutex' was not declared. Should it be static?
