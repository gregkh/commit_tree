srcu: Add notrace variants of srcu_read_{lock,unlock}

This is needed for a future tracepoint patch that uses srcu, and to make
sure it doesn't call into lockdep.

tracepoint code already calls notrace variants for rcu_read_lock_sched
so this patch does the same for srcu which will be used in a later
patch. Keeps it consistent with rcu-sched.
