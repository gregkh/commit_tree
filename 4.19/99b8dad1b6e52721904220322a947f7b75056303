lightnvm: pblk: enable line minor version detection

When recovering a line, an extra check was added when debugging was
active, such that minor version where also checked. Unfortunately,
this used the ifdef NVM_DEBUG, which is not correct.

Instead use the proper DEBUG def, and now that it compiles, also fix
the variable.
