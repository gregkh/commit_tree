tools/vm/page-types.c: include shared map counts

Add a new flag that will read kpagecount for each PFN and print out the
number of times the page is mapped along with the flags in the listing
view.

This information is useful in understanding and optimizing memory usage.
Identifying pages which are not shared allows us to focus on adjusting
the memory layout or access patterns for the sole owning process.
Knowing the number of processes that share a page tells us how many
other times we must make the same adjustments or how many processes to
potentially disable.

Truncated sample output:
