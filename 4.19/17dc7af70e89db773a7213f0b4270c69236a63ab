drm/i915/overlay: Allocate physical registers from stolen

Given that we are now reasonably confident in our ability to detect and
reserve the stolen memory (physical memory reserved for graphics by the
BIOS) for ourselves on most machines, we can put it to use. In this

introduced stuttering into his video playback. After discarding the

with the use of the phys object for the overlay. And lo, if we
completely avoid using the phys object (allocated just once on module
load!) by switching to stolen memory, the stuttering goes away.

For lack of a better explanation, claim victory and kill two birds with
one stone.
