scsi: lpfc: Fix NVME Target crash in defer rcv logic

Kernel occasionally crashed with the following
ops on NVME Target:
  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000058
  IP: [<ffffffffa042ee50>] lpfc_nvmet_defer_rcv+0x50/0x70 [lpfc]

Callback routine was called for deferred rcv when it should be treated as a
normal rcv.

Added code in callback routine to detect this condition and log a message,
then bail.
