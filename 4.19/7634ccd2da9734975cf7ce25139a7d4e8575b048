Thanks for your work in this area. I still remember the first linux
storage summit we did in Vancouver 2001, Tejun was invited to talk about
his libata error handling work. Before that, it was basically a crap
shoot if we recovered properly or not... A lot of water has flown under
the bridge since then!

Here's an "official" patch. Linus, can you apply it?
