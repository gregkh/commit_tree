platform/x86: silead_dmi: Sort entries alphabetically

We have so much entries now that it is good to bring some form of order
to them. This should also reduce conflicts when multiple patches make
changes at the same time (compared to tagging all new entries at the end).

Note this commit purely moves stuff around and adds 2 comments about
keeping the data and table alphabetically sorted. There are no functional
changes.
