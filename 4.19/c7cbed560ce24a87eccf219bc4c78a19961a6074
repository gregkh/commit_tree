drm/gma500: Fix Medfield for drm_framebuffer move

Commit bc61c97502e2 ("drm/gma500: Move GEM BO to drm_framebuffer") moved
the gtt_range structure, from being in psb_framebuffer and embedding the
GEM object, to being placed in the drm_framebuffer with the gtt_range
being derived from the GEM object.

The conversion missed out the Medfield subdriver, which was not being
built in the default drm-misc config. Do the trivial fixup here.
