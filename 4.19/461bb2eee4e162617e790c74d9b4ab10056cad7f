IB/uverbs: Add a simple allocator to uverbs_attr_bundle

This is similar in spirit to devm, it keeps track of any allocations
linked to this method call and ensures they are all freed when the method
exits. Further, if there is space in the internal/onstack buffer then the
allocator will hand out that memory and avoid an expensive call to
kalloc/kfree in the syscall path.
