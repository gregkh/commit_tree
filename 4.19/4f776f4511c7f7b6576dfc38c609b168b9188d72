drm/msm/gpu: Convert the GPU show function to use the GPU state

Convert the existing GPU show function to use the GPU state to
dump the information rather than reading it directly from the hardware.
This will require an additional step to capture the state before
dumping it for the existing nodes but it will greatly facilitate reusing
the same code for dumping a previously captured state from a GPU hang.
