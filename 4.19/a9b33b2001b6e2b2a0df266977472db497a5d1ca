selftests: forwarding: Test mirror-to-gretap w/ UL team

Test for "tc action mirred egress mirror" that mirrors to gretap when
the underlay route points at a VLAN-aware bridge (802.1q), and the
traffic egresses the bridge through a team device. Test upping and
downing individual team device slaves and verify the traffic flows as
expected.
