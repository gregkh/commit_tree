x86/intel_rdt: Discover supported platforms via prefetch disable bits

Knowing the model specific prefetch disable bits is required to support
cache pseudo-locking because the hardware prefetchers need to be disabled
when the kernel memory is pseudo-locked to cache. We add these bits only
for platforms known to support cache pseudo-locking.

When the user requests locksetup mode to be entered it will fail if the
prefetch disabling bits are not known for the platform.
