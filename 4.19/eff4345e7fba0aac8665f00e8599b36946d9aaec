crash_core: use VMCOREINFO_SYMBOL_ARRAY() for swapper_pg_dir

This is preparation for allowing CRASH_CORE to be enabled for any
architecture.

swapper_pg_dir is always either an array or a macro expanding to NULL.
In the latter case, VMCOREINFO_SYMBOL() won't work, as it tries to take
the address of the given symbol:

	#define VMCOREINFO_SYMBOL(name) \
		vmcoreinfo_append_str("SYMBOL(%s)=%lx\n", #name, (unsigned long)&name)

Instead, use VMCOREINFO_SYMBOL_ARRAY(), which uses the value:

	#define VMCOREINFO_SYMBOL_ARRAY(name) \
		vmcoreinfo_append_str("SYMBOL(%s)=%lx\n", #name, (unsigned long)name)

This is the same thing for the array case but isn't an error for the macro
case.
