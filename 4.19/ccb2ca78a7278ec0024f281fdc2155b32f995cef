media: pci: cx23885: Replace mdelay() with msleep() and usleep_range() in altera_ci_slot_reset()

altera_ci_slot_reset() is never called in atomic context.
It calls mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
