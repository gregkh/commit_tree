s390/qdio: reset old sbal_state flags

When allocating a new AOB fails, handle_outbound() is still capable of
transmitting the selected buffer (just without async completion).

But if a previous transfer on this queue slot used async completion, its
sbal_state flags field is still set to QDIO_OUTBUF_STATE_FLAG_PENDING.
So when the upper layer driver sees this stale flag, it expects an async
completion that never happens.

Fix this by unconditionally clearing the flags field.
