powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Reduce upper limit for DMA window size (again)

mpe: This was fixed originally in commit d3d4ffaae439
("powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Reduce upper limit for DMA window size"), but
contrary to what the merge commit says was inadvertently lost by me in
commit ce57c6610cc2 ("Merge branch 'topic/ppc-kvm' into next") which
brought in changes that moved the code to a new file. So reapply it to
the new file.

Original commit message follows:

We use PHB in mode1 which uses bit 59 to select a correct DMA window.
However there is mode2 which uses bits 59:55 and allows up to 32 DMA
windows per a PE.

Even though documentation does not clearly specify that, it seems that
the actual hardware does not support bits 59:55 even in mode1, in
other words we can create a window as big as 1<<58 but DMA simply
won't work.

This reduces the upper limit from 59 to 55 bits to let the userspace
know about the hardware limits.
