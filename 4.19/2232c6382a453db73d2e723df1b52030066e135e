device-dax: Enable page_mapping()

In support of enabling memory_failure() handling for device-dax
mappings, set the ->mapping association of pages backing device-dax
mappings. The rmap implementation requires page_mapping() to return the
address_space hosting the vmas that map the page.

The ->mapping pointer is never cleared. There is no possibility for the
page to become associated with another address_space while the device is
enabled. When the device is disabled the 'struct page' array for the
device is destroyed / later reinitialized to zero.
