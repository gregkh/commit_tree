staging:rtl8192u: Refactor dm_dig_connect_e - Style

The enumerated type dm_dig_connect_e is only used to group constant
values, as the actual type is never used as the type for the variables
which use the defined constants (cur_connect_state and pre_connect_state).

These two member variables have had there defined types changed to
properly reflect there usage and to permit compiler type checks to be
performed.

In addition the definition of the enumerated type has been moved above
the structure which uses the type. The typedef of the enumerated type
has been removed to clear the checkpatch issue with defining new types
and the enumerated value DIG_CONNECT_MAX has been removed since it is
never used in code.

The resulting changes are all coding style in nature and should not
impact runtime code execution.
