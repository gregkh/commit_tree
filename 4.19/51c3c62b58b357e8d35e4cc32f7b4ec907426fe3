powerpc: Avoid code patching freed init sections

This stops us from doing code patching in init sections after they've
been freed.

In this chain:
  kvm_guest_init() ->
    kvm_use_magic_page() ->
      fault_in_pages_readable() ->
	 __get_user() ->
	   __get_user_nocheck() ->
	     barrier_nospec();

We have a code patching location at barrier_nospec() and
kvm_guest_init() is an init function. This whole chain gets inlined,
so when we free the init section (hence kvm_guest_init()), this code
goes away and hence should no longer be patched.

We seen this as userspace memory corruption when using a memory
checker while doing partition migration testing on powervm (this
starts the code patching post migration via
/sys/kernel/mobility/migration). In theory, it could also happen when
using /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/barrier_nospec.
