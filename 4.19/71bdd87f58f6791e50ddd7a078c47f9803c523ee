ver_linux: Do not check for ver_linux pattern in version function

Checking whether output of commands matches the ver_linux pattern in
the version function is original shell implementation legacy code. When
the original implementation failed to locate a particular utility,
it generated error output along the lines of:

ver_linux:line number: command not found.

The awk implementation, does not contain the name of the script within the
body of the error message returned by the subshell when a given utility
fails to be located. The error message returned is along the lines of:

sh: name of utility: command not found

Safeguarding against the ver_linux pattern being found in the output
being parsed may thus be safely omitted.
