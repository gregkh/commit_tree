scsi: cxlflash: Change return type for fault handler

Use new return type vm_fault_t for fault handler. For now, this is just
documenting that the function returns a VM_FAULT value rather than an
errno. Once all instances are converted, vm_fault_t will become a distinct
type.

Ref-> commit 1c8f422059ae ("mm: change return type to vm_fault_t")

Previously, VM_FAULT_NOPAGE was returned without verifying return value of
vm_insert_pfn. The new inline vmf_insert_pfn() will address this issue by
returning correct VM_FAULT_* type from fault handler.
