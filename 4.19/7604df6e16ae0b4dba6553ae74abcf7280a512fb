x86/intel_rdt: Support flexible data to parsing callbacks

Each resource is associated with a configurable callback that should be
used to parse the information provided for the particular resource from
user space. In addition to the resource and domain pointers this callback
is provided with just the character buffer being parsed.

In support of flexible parsing the callback is modified to support a void
pointer as argument. This enables resources that need more data than just
the user provided data to pass its required data to the callback without
affecting the signatures for the callbacks of all the other resources.
