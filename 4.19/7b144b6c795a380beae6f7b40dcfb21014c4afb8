tracing: Remove orphaned function using_ftrace_ops_list_func().

Remove using_ftrace_ops_list_func() since it is no longer used.

Using ftrace_ops_list_func() has been introduced by commit 7eea4fce0246
("tracing/stack_trace: Skip 4 instead of 3 when using ftrace_ops_list_func")
as a helper function, but its caller has been removed by commit 72ac426a5bb0
("tracing: Clean up stack tracing and fix fentry updates").  So it is not
called anymore.
