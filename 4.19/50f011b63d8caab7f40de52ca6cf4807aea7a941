bnxt_en: Update RSS setup and GRO-HW logic according to the latest spec.

Set the default hash mode flag in HWRM_VNIC_RSS_CFG to signal to the
firmware that the driver is compliant with the latest spec.  With
that, the firmware can return expanded RSS profile IDs that the driver
checks to setup the proper gso_type for GRO-HW packets.  But instead
of checking for the new profile IDs, we check the IP_TYPE flag
in TPA_START which is more straight forward than checking a list of
profile IDs.
