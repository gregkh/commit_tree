nfp: fail probe if serial or interface id is missing

On some platforms with broken ACPI tables we may not have access
to the Serial Number PCIe capability.  This capability is crucial
for us for switchdev operation as we use serial number as switch ID,
and for communication with management FW where interface ID is used.

If we can't determine the Serial Number we have to fail device probe.
