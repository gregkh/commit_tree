Bluetooth: btqca: Rename ROME specific functions to generic functions

Some of the QCA BTSoC ROME functions, are used for different versions
or different make of BTSoC's. Instead of duplicating the same functions
for new chip, update names of the functions that are used for both
chips to keep this generic and would help in future when we would have
new BT SoC. To have generic text in logs updated from ROME to QCA where
ever possible. This avoids confusion to user, when using the future
Qualcomm Bluetooth SoC's. Updated BT_DBG, BT_ERR and BT_INFO with
bt_dev_dbg, bt_dev_err and bt_dev_info where ever applicable.
