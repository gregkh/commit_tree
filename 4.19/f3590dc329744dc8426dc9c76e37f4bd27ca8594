media: arch: sh: kfr2r09: Use new renesas-ceu camera driver

Use the new renesas-ceu camera driver in kfr2r09 board file instead of
the soc_camera based sh_mobile_ceu_camera driver.

Get rid of soc_camera specific components, and move clk and gpio handling
away from board file, registering the clock source and the enable gpios
for driver consumption.

Memory for the CEU video buffers is now reserved with membocks APIs,
and need to be declared as dma_coherent during machine initialization to
remove that architecture specific part from CEU driver.

While at there update license to SPDX header and sort headers alphabetically.

No need to udapte the clock source names, as
commit c2f9b05fd5c1 ("media: arch: sh: ecovec: Use new renesas-ceu camera driver")
already updated it to the new ceu driver name for all SH7724 boards (possibly
breaking kfr2r09 before this commit).

Compile tested only.
