cpufreq: governor: Avoid accessing invalid governor_data

If cppc_cpufreq.ko is deleted at the same time that tuned-adm is
changing profiles, there is a small chance that a race can occur
between cpufreq_dbs_governor_exit() and cpufreq_dbs_governor_limits()
resulting in a system failure when the latter tries to use
policy->governor_data that has been freed by the former.

This patch uses gov_dbs_data_mutex to synchronize access.
