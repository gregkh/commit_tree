usb: dwc3: core: Enable AutoRetry feature in the controller

By default when core sees any transaction error (CRC or overflow) it
replies with terminating retry ACK (Retry=1 and Nump == 0).

Enabling this Auto Retry feature in controller will make the core send
a non-terminanting ACK upon such transaction errors. That is, ACK TP
with Retry=1 and Nump != 0.

Doing so will give controller a chance to recover from transient error
conditions.
