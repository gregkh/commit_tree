uapi/linux/keyctl.h: don't use C++ reserved keyword as a struct member name

Since this header is in "include/uapi/linux/", apparently people want to
use it in userspace programs -- even in C++ ones.  However, the header
uses a C++ reserved keyword ("private"), so change that to "dh_private"
instead to allow the header file to be used in C++ userspace.
