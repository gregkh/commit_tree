drm/amd/display: Allow clock lower on dce100

dce100 was set to always pass safe_to_lower = false
to the clock manager

Thus, on suspend the clocks were not being set to 0
which is incorrect behaviour

This was causing s3 resume to blackscreen on intel
CPUs with dce100 GPUs attached

Fixes: ae7d8aeb38d7 ("drm/amd/display: remove safe_to_lower flag from dc, use 2 functions instead")
