ixgbe: fix Kconfig when driver is not a module

The new ability added to the driver to use mii_bus to handle MII related
ioctls is causing compile issues when the driver is compiled into the
kernel (i.e. not a module).

The problem was in selecting MDIO_DEVICE instead of the preferred PHYLIB
Kconfig option.  The reason being that MDIO_DEVICE had a dependency on
PHYLIB and would be compiled as a module when PHYLIB was a module, no
matter whether ixgbe was compiled into the kernel.
