btrfs: Remove extra reference count bumps in btrfs_compare_trees

When the 2 comparison trees roots are initialised they are private to
the function and already have reference counts of 1 each. There is no
need to further increment the reference count since the cloned buffers
are already accessed via struct btrfs_path. Eventually the 2 paths used
for comparison are going to be released, effectively disposing of the
cloned buffers.
