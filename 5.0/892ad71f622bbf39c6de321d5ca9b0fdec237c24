dm: set the static flush bio device on demand

The next patch changes the macro bio_set_dev() to associate a bio with a
blkg based on the device set. However, dm creates a static bio to be
used as the basis for cloning empty flush bios on creation. The
bio_set_dev() call in alloc_dev() will cause problems with the next
patch adding association to bio_set_dev() because the call is before the
bdev is associated with a gendisk (bd_disk is %NULL). To get around
this, set the device on the static bio every time and use that to clone
to the other bios.
