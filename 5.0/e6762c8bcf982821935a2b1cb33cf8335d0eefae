xsk: add missing smp_rmb() in xsk_mmap

All the setup code in AF_XDP is protected by a mutex with the
exception of the mmap code that cannot use it. To make sure that a
process banging on the mmap call at the same time as another process
is setting up the socket, smp_wmb() calls were added in the umem
registration code and the queue creation code, so that the published
structures that xsk_mmap needs would be consistent. However, the
corresponding smp_rmb() calls were not added to the xsk_mmap
code. This patch adds these calls.
