perf augmented_syscalls: Drop 'write', 'poll' for testing without self pid filter

When testing system wide tracing without filtering the syscalls called
by 'perf trace' itself we get into a feedback loop, drop for now those
two syscalls, that are the ones that 'perf trace' does in its loop for
writing the syscalls it intercepts, to help with testing till we get
that filtering in place.
