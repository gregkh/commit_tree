scsi: core: reset host byte in DID_NEXUS_FAILURE case

Up to 4.12, __scsi_error_from_host_byte() would reset the host byte to
DID_OK for various cases including DID_NEXUS_FAILURE.  Commit
2a842acab109 ("block: introduce new block status code type") replaced this
function with scsi_result_to_blk_status() and removed the host-byte
resetting code for the DID_NEXUS_FAILURE case.  As the line
set_host_byte(cmd, DID_OK) was preserved for the other cases, I suppose
this was an editing mistake.

The fact that the host byte remains set after 4.13 is causing problems with
the sg_persist tool, which now returns success rather then exit status 24
when a RESERVATION CONFLICT error is encountered.
