mm/page_owner: clamp read count to PAGE_SIZE

The (root-only) page owner read might allocate a large size of memory with
a large read count.  Allocation fails can easily occur when doing high
order allocations.

Clamp buffer size to PAGE_SIZE to avoid arbitrary size allocation
and avoid allocation fails due to high order allocation.
