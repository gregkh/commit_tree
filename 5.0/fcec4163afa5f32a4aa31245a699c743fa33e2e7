drm/panel: Add simple panel mode for the ARM RTSM

Having failed any attempts at a more generic solution,
I fall back to the very specific solution: define a simple
panel for the ARM RTSM emulated platforms.

I am doing this so we can convert all old users from the
previous fbdev driver to the PL111 DRM driver.

This works fine as far as I can test, provided the
device tree for RTSM AEMv8 is augmented accordingly.
