bpf: allow BPF read access to qdisc pkt_len

The pkt_len field in qdisc_skb_cb stores the skb length as it will
appear on the wire after segmentation. For byte accounting, this value
is more accurate than skb->len. It is computed on entry to the TC
layer, so only valid there.

Allow read access to this field from BPF tc classifier and action
programs. The implementation is analogous to tc_classid, aside from
restricting to read access.

To distinguish it from skb->len and self-describe export as wire_len.

Changes v1->v2
  - Rename pkt_len to wire_len
