nfsd: drop useless LIST_HEAD

Drop LIST_HEAD where the variable it declares is never used.

This was introduced in c5c707f96fc9a ("nfsd: implement pNFS
layout recalls"), but was not used even in that commit.

The semantic patch that fixes this problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
identifier x;
@@
- LIST_HEAD(x);
  ... when != x
// </smpl>
