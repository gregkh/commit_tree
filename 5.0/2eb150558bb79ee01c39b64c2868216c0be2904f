platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Show Latency Tolerance info

This adds support to show the Latency Tolerance Reporting for the IPs on
the PCH as reported by the PMC. The format shown here is raw LTR data
payload that can further be decoded as per the PCI specification.

This also fixes some minor alignment issues in the header file by
removing spaces and converting to tabs at some places.
