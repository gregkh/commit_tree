NFS/SUNRPC: don't lookup machine credential until rpcauth_bindcred().

When NFS creates a machine credential, it is a "generic" credential,
not tied to any auth protocol, and is really just a container for
the princpal name.
This doesn't get linked to a genuine credential until rpcauth_bindcred()
is called.
The lookup always succeeds, so various places that test if the machine
credential is NULL, are pointless.

As a step towards getting rid of generic credentials, this patch gets
rid of generic machine credentials.  The nfs_client and rpc_client
just hold a pointer to a constant principal name.
When a machine credential is wanted, a special static 'struct rpc_cred'
pointer is used. rpcauth_bindcred() recognizes this, finds the
principal from the client, and binds the correct credential.
