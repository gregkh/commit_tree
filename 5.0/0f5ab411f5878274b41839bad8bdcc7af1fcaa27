dt-bindings: clock: add imx8qxp lpcg clock binding

The Low-Power Clock Gate (LPCG) modules contain a local programming
model to control the clock gates for the peripherals. An LPCG module
is used to locally gate the clocks for the associated peripheral.

Note:
This level of clock gating is provided after the clocks are generated
by the SCU resources and clock controls. Thus even if the clock is
enabled by these control bits, it might still not be running based
on the base resource.
