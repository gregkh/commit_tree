autofs: improve ioctl sbi checks

Al Viro made some suggestions to improve the implementation of commit
0633da48f0 ("fix autofs_sbi() does not check super block type").

The check is unnecessary in all cases except for ioctl usage so placing
the check in the super block accessor function adds a small overhead to
the common case where it isn't needed.

So it's sufficient to do this in the ioctl code only.

Also the check in the ioctl code is needlessly complex.
