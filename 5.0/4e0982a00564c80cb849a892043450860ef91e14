fs/epoll: simplify ep_send_events_proc() ready-list loop

The current logic is a bit convoluted.  Lets simplify this with a
standard list_for_each_entry_safe() loop instead and just break out
after maxevents is reached.

While at it, remove an unnecessary indentation level in the loop when
there are in fact ready events.
