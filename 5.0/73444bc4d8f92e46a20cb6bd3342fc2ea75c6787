mm, page_alloc: do not wake kswapd with zone lock held

syzbot reported the following regression in the latest merge window and
it was confirmed by Qian Cai that a similar bug was visible from a
different context.

  ======================================================
  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
  4.20.0+ #297 Not tainted
  ------------------------------------------------------
  syz-executor0/8529 is trying to acquire lock:
  000000005e7fb829 (&pgdat->kswapd_wait){....}, at:
  __wake_up_common_lock+0x19e/0x330 kernel/sched/wait.c:120

  but task is already holding lock:

It appears to be a false positive in that the only way the lock ordering
should be inverted is if kswapd is waking itself and the wakeup
allocates debugging objects which should already be allocated if it's
kswapd doing the waking.  Nevertheless, the possibility exists and so
it's best to avoid the problem.

This patch flags a zone as needing a kswapd using the, surprisingly,
unused zone flag field.  The flag is read without the lock held to do
the wakeup.  It's possible that the flag setting context is not the same
as the flag clearing context or for small races to occur.  However, each
race possibility is harmless and there is no visible degredation in
fragmentation treatment.

While zone->flag could have continued to be unused, there is potential
for moving some existing fields into the flags field instead.
Particularly read-mostly ones like zone->initialized and
zone->contiguous.
