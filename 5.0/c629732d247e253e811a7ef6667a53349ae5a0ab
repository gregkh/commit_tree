btrfs: Remove unused extent_state argument from btrfs_writepage_endio_finish_ordered

This parameter was never used, yet was part of the interface of the
function ever since its introduction as extent_io_ops::writepage_end_io_hook
in e6dcd2dc9c48 ("Btrfs: New data=ordered implementation"). Now that
NULL is passed everywhere as a value for this parameter let's remove it
for good. No functional changes.
