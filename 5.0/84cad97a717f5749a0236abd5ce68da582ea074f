staging: rtl8188eu: Fix module loading from tasklet for CCMP encryption

Commit 6bd082af7e36 ("staging:r8188eu: use lib80211 CCMP decrypt")
causes scheduling while atomic bugs followed by a hard freeze whenever
the driver tries to connect to a CCMP-encrypted network. Experimentation
showed that the freezes were eliminated when module lib80211 was
preloaded, which can be forced by calling lib80211_get_crypto_ops()
directly rather than indirectly through try_then_request_module().
With this change, no BUG messages are logged.
