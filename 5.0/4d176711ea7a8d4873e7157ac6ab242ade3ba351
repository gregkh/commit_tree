kasan: preassign tags to objects with ctors or SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU

An object constructor can initialize pointers within this objects based on
the address of the object.  Since the object address might be tagged, we
need to assign a tag before calling constructor.

The implemented approach is to assign tags to objects with constructors
when a slab is allocated and call constructors once as usual.  The
downside is that such object would always have the same tag when it is
reallocated, so we won't catch use-after-frees on it.

Also pressign tags for objects from SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU caches, since
they can be validy accessed after having been freed.
