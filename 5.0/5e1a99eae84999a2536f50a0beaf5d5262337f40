ipv4: Add ICMPv6 support when parse route ipproto

For ip rules, we need to use 'ipproto ipv6-icmp' to match ICMPv6 headers.
But for ip -6 route, currently we only support tcp, udp and icmp.

Add ICMPv6 support so we can match ipv6-icmp rules for route lookup.

v2: As David Ahern and Sabrina Dubroca suggested, Add an argument to
rtm_getroute_parse_ip_proto() to handle ICMP/ICMPv6 with different family.
