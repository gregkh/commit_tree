drm: Add an hx8367d tinydrm driver.

I want to sort out support for tinydrm in vc4, so I needed to get a
tinydrm-appropriate panel working and this is what I had on hand.
This is derived from a combination of ili9341.c from tinydrm and
fb_hx8357d.c from staging's fbtft.

v2: Write my own register defs from the spec to not need the header
    from fbtft.  Fix spi device string to enable module autoloading.
