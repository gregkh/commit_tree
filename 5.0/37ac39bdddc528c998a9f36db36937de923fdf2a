Revert "kill dev_ifsioc()"

This reverts commit bf4405737f9f ("kill dev_ifsioc()").

This wasn't really unused as implied by the original commit,
it still handles the copy to/from user differently, and the
commit thus caused issues such as
  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199469
and
  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202273

However, deviating from a strict revert, rename dev_ifsioc()
to compat_ifreq_ioctl() to be clearer as to its purpose and
add a comment.
