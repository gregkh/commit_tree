KVM: VMX: Move VMCS definitions to dedicated file

This isn't intended to be a pure reflection of hardware, e.g. struct
loaded_vmcs and struct vmcs_host_state are KVM-defined constructs.
Similar to capabilities.h, this is a standalone file to avoid circular
dependencies between yet-to-be-created vmx.h and nested.h files.
