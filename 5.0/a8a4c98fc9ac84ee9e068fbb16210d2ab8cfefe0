x86/dma/amd-gart: Stop resizing dma_debug_entry pool

dma-debug is now capable of adding new entries to its pool on-demand if
the initial preallocation was insufficient, so the IOMMU_LEAK logic no
longer needs to explicitly change the pool size. This does lose it the
ability to save a couple of megabytes of RAM by reducing the pool size
below its default, but it seems unlikely that that is a realistic
concern these days (or indeed that anyone is actively debugging AGP
drivers' DMA usage any more). Getting rid of dma_debug_resize_entries()
will make room for further streamlining in the dma-debug code itself.

Removing the call reveals quite a lot of cruft which has been useless
for nearly a decade since commit 19c1a6f5764d ("x86 gart: reimplement
IOMMU_LEAK feature by using DMA_API_DEBUG"), including the entire
'iommu=leak' parameter, which controlled nothing except whether
dma_debug_resize_entries() was called or not.
