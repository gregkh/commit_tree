net: bridge: Fix ethernet header pointer before check skb forwardable

The skb header should be set to ethernet header before using
is_skb_forwardable. Because the ethernet header length has been
considered in is_skb_forwardable(including dev->hard_header_len
length).

To reproduce the issue:
1, add 2 ports on linux bridge br using following commands:
$ brctl addbr br
$ brctl addif br eth0
$ brctl addif br eth1
2, the MTU of eth0 and eth1 is 1500
3, send a packet(Data 1480, UDP 8, IP 20, Ethernet 14, VLAN 4)
from eth0 to eth1

So the expect result is packet larger than 1500 cannot pass through
eth0 and eth1. But currently, the packet passes through success, it
means eth1's MTU limit doesn't take effect.
