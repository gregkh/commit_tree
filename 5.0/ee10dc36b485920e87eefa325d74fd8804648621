media: cropcap/g_selection split

If g_selection is implemented, then the v4l2-ioctl cropcap code assumes
that cropcap just implements the pixelaspect part and that g_selection
provides the crop bounds and default rectangles.

There are still some drivers that only implement cropcap and not
g_selection. Split up cropcap into a cropcap and g_selection for those
drivers.
