bpf: call verifier_prep from its callback in struct bpf_offload_dev

In a way similar to the change previously brought to the verify_insn
hook and to the finalize callback, switch to the newly added ops in
struct bpf_prog_offload for calling the functions used to prepare driver
verifiers.

Since the dev_ops pointer in struct bpf_prog_offload is no longer used
by any callback, we can now remove it from struct bpf_prog_offload.
