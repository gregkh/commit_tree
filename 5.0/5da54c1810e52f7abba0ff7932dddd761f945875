net/core: Replace call_rcu_bh() and synchronize_rcu_bh()

Now that call_rcu()'s callback is not invoked until after all bh-disable
regions of code have completed (in addition to explicitly marked
RCU read-side critical sections), call_rcu() can be used in place of
call_rcu_bh().  Similarly, synchronize_rcu() can be used in place of
synchronize_rcu_bh().  This commit therefore makes these changes.
