regulator: max8973: Let core handle GPIO descriptor

The probe path of this driver is a bit complex: sometimes the
GPIO descriptor is passed to the regulator core, sometimes
it is not.

To handle it in a simple way: stick with the devm_* resource
management and unhinge the GPIO descriptor devres handling
right before passing it to the regulator core, if we pass it
to the regulator core.
