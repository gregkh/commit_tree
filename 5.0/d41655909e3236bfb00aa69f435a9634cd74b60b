crypto: remove useless initializations of cra_list

Some algorithms initialize their .cra_list prior to registration.
But this is unnecessary since crypto_register_alg() will overwrite
.cra_list when adding the algorithm to the 'crypto_alg_list'.
Apparently the useless assignment has just been copy+pasted around.

So, remove the useless assignments.

Exception: paes_s390.c uses cra_list to check whether the algorithm is
registered or not, so I left that as-is for now.

This patch shouldn't change any actual behavior.
