y2038: futex: Add support for __kernel_timespec

This prepares sys_futex for y2038 safe calling: the native
syscall is changed to receive a __kernel_timespec argument, which
will be switched to 64-bit time_t in the future. All the internal
time handling gets changed to timespec64, and the compat_sys_futex
entry point is moved under the CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME check
to provide compatibility for existing 32-bit architectures.
