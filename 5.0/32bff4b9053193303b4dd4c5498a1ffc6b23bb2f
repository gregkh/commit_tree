powerpc/mm: remove unnecessary test in pgtable_cache_init()

pgtable_cache_add() gracefully handles the case when a cache that
size already exists by returning early with the following test:

	if (PGT_CACHE(shift))
		return; /* Already have a cache of this size */

It is then not needed to test the existence of the cache before.
