bpf: Apply F_NEEDS_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS to more ACCEPT test cases.

If a testcase has alignment problems but is expected to be ACCEPT,
verify it using F_NEEDS_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS too.

Maybe in the future if we add some architecture specific code to elide
the unaligned memory access warnings during the test, we can execute
these as well.
