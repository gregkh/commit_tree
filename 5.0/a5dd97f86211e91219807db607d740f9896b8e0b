crypto: x86/chacha20 - Add a 2-block AVX2 variant

This variant uses the same principle as the single block SSSE3 variant
by shuffling the state matrix after each round. With the wider AVX
registers, we can do two blocks in parallel, though.

This function can increase performance and efficiency significantly for
lengths that would otherwise require a 4-block function.
