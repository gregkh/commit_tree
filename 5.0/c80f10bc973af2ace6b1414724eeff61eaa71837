netfilter: nf_conncount: speculative garbage collection on empty lists

Instead of removing a empty list node that might be reintroduced soon
thereafter, tentatively place the empty list node on the list passed to
tree_nodes_free(), then re-check if the list is empty again before erasing
it from the tree.

[ Florian: rebase on top of pending nf_conncount fixes ]
