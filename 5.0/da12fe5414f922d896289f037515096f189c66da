btrfs: Refactor btrfs_merge_bio_hook

This function really checks whether adding more data to the bio will
straddle a stripe/chunk. So first let's give it a more appropraite name
- btrfs_bio_fits_in_stripe. Secondly, the offset parameter was never
used to just remove it. Thirdly, pages are submitted to either btree or
data inodes so it's guaranteed that tree->ops is set so replace the
check with an ASSERT. Finally, document the parameters of the function.
No functional changes.
