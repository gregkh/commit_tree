cifs: check ntwrk_buf_start for NULL before dereferencing it

RHBZ: 1021460

There is an issue where when multiple threads open/close the same directory
ntwrk_buf_start might end up being NULL, causing the call to smbCalcSize
later to oops with a NULL deref.

The real bug is why this happens and why this can become NULL for an
open cfile, which should not be allowed.
This patch tries to avoid a oops until the time when we fix the underlying
issue.
