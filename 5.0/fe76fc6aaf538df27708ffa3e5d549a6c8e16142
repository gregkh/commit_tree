sbitmap: Protect swap_lock from hardirq

Because we may call blk_mq_get_driver_tag() directly from
blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list() without holding any lock, then HARDIRQ may
come and the above DEADLOCK is triggered.

Commit ab53dcfb3e7b ("sbitmap: Protect swap_lock from hardirq") tries to
fix this issue by using 'spin_lock_bh', which isn't enough because we
complete request from hardirq context direclty in case of multiqueue.
