netfilter: nf_tables: unbind set in rule from commit path

Anonymous sets that are bound to rules from the same transaction trigger
a kernel splat from the abort path due to double set list removal and
double free.

This patch updates the logic to search for the transaction that is
responsible for creating the set and disable the set list removal and
release, given the rule is now responsible for this. Lookup is reverse
since the transaction that adds the set is likely to be at the tail of
the list.

Moreover, this patch adds the unbind step to deliver the event from the
commit path.  This should not be done from the worker thread, since we
have no guarantees of in-order delivery to the listener.

This patch removes the assumption that both activate and deactivate
callbacks need to be provided.
