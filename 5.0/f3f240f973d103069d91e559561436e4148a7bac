iwlwifi: mvm: remove queue_info_lock

All the queue management code runs under mvm->mutex, so there are
only very few cases of accessing the data structures without it:
 * TX path, which doesn't take any locks anyway
 * iwl_mvm_wake_sw_queue() and iwl_mvm_stop_sw_queue() where we
   just (atomically) read a bitmap, so the lock isn't needed.

Therefore, we can remove the spinlock. This enables some cleanup
in the ugly locking in iwl_mvm_inactivity_check().
