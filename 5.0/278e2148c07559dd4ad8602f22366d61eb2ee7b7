Revert "bridge: do not add port to router list when receives query with source 0.0.0.0"

This reverts commit 5a2de63fd1a5 ("bridge: do not add port to router list
when receives query with source 0.0.0.0") and commit 0fe5119e267f ("net:
bridge: remove ipv6 zero address check in mcast queries")

The reason is RFC 4541 is not a standard but suggestive. Currently we
will elect 0.0.0.0 as Querier if there is no ip address configured on
bridge. If we do not add the port which recives query with source
0.0.0.0 to router list, the IGMP reports will not be about to forward
to Querier, IGMP data will also not be able to forward to dest.

As Nikolay suggested, revert this change first and add a boolopt api
to disable none-zero election in future if needed.
