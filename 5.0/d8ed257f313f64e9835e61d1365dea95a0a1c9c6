tcp: handle EOR and FIN conditions the same in tcp_tso_should_defer()

In commit f9bfe4e6a9d0 ("tcp: lack of available data can also cause
TSO defer") we moved the test in tcp_tso_should_defer() for packets
with a FIN flag, and we mentioned that the same would be done
later for EOR flag.

Both flags should be handled at the same time, after all other
heuristics have been considered. They both mean that no more bytes
can be added to this skb by an application.
