cpufreq: intel_pstate: Force HWP min perf before offline

Force HWP Request MAX = HWP Request MIN = HWP Capability MIN and EPP to
0xFF. In this way the performance limits on the offlined CPU will not
influence performance limits on its sibling CPU, which is still online.

If the sibling CPU is calling for higher performance, it will impact the
max core performance. Here core performance will follow higher of the
performance requests from each sibling.
