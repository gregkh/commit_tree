KVM: arm/arm64: Reset the VCPU without preemption and vcpu state loaded

We have two ways to reset a vcpu:
- either through VCPU_INIT
- or through a PSCI_ON call

The first one is easy to reason about. The second one is implemented
in a more bizarre way, as it is the vcpu that handles PSCI_ON that
resets the vcpu that is being powered-on. As we need to turn the logic
around and have the target vcpu to reset itself, we must take some
preliminary steps.

Resetting the VCPU state modifies the system register state in memory,
but this may interact with vcpu_load/vcpu_put if running with preemption
disabled, which in turn may lead to corrupted system register state.

Address this by disabling preemption and doing put/load if required
around the reset logic.
