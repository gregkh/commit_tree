ASoC: rsnd: ssiu: correct shift bit for ssiu9

Currently "0xf << 36" is used to
clear SSIU-9 internal buffer state, which overflows 32-bit value
according to user reference manual, it is always bit4 ~ bit7
of SSI_SYS_STATUS[1,3,5,7] registers indicate
SSIU-9's buffer state, so "0xf << 4" should be used.

This patch fix incorrect shifting issue in SSIU-9 case

Fixes: commit b7169ddea2f2 ("ASoC: rsnd: remove RSND_REG_ from rsnd_reg")
