fsi: Add On-Chip Controller (OCC) driver

The OCC is a device embedded on a POWER processor that collects and
aggregates sensor data from the processor and system. The OCC can
provide the raw sensor data as well as perform thermal and power
management on the system.

This driver provides an atomic communications channel between a service
processor (e.g. a BMC) and the OCC. The driver is dependent on the FSI
SBEFIFO driver to get hardware access through the SBE to the OCC SRAM.
Commands are issued to the SBE to send or fetch data to the SRAM.
