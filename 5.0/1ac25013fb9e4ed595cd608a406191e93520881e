mm/hugetlb.c: teach follow_hugetlb_page() to handle FOLL_NOWAIT

hugetlb needs the same fix as faultin_nopage (which was applied in
commit 96312e61282a ("mm/gup.c: teach get_user_pages_unlocked to handle
FOLL_NOWAIT")) or KVM hangs because it thinks the mmap_sem was already
released by hugetlb_fault() if it returned VM_FAULT_RETRY, but it wasn't
in the FOLL_NOWAIT case.
