KVM: PPC: Book3S: Only report KVM_CAP_SPAPR_TCE_VFIO on powernv machines

The kvm capability KVM_CAP_SPAPR_TCE_VFIO is used to indicate the
availability of in kernel tce acceleration for vfio. However it is
currently the case that this is only available on a powernv machine,
not for a pseries machine.

Thus make this capability dependent on having the cpu feature
CPU_FTR_HVMODE.
