clk: meson: meson8b: do not use cpu_div3 for cpu_scale_out_sel

The cpu_div3 clock (cpu_in divided by 3) generates a signal with a duty
cycle of 33%. The CPU clock however requires a clock signal with a duty
cycle of 50% to run stable.
cpu_div3 was observed to be problematic when cycling through all
available CPU frequencies (with additional patches on top of this one)
while running "stress --cpu 4" in the background. This caused sporadic
hangs where the whole system would fully lock up.

Amlogic's 3.10 kernel code also does not use the cpu_div3 clock either
when changing the CPU clock.
