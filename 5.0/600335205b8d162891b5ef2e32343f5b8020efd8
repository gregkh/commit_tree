ide: convert to blk-mq

ide-disk and ide-cd tested as working just fine, ide-tape and
ide-floppy haven't. But the latter don't require changes, so they
should work without issue.

Add helper function to insert a request from a work queue, since we
cannot invoke the blk-mq request insertion from IRQ context.
