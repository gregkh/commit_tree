drbd: Avoid Clang warning about pointless switch statment

There are several warnings from Clang about no case statement matching
the constant 0:

In file included from drivers/block/drbd/drbd_receiver.c:48:
In file included from drivers/block/drbd/drbd_int.h:48:
In file included from ./include/linux/drbd_genl_api.h:54:
In file included from ./include/linux/genl_magic_struct.h:236:
./include/linux/drbd_genl.h:321:1: warning: no case matching constant
switch condition '0'
GENL_struct(DRBD_NLA_HELPER, 24, drbd_helper_info,
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
./include/linux/genl_magic_struct.h:220:10: note: expanded from macro
'GENL_struct'
        switch (0) {
                ^

Silence this warning by adding a 'case 0:' statement. Additionally,
adjust the alignment of the statements in the ct_assert_unique macro to
avoid a checkpatch warning.
