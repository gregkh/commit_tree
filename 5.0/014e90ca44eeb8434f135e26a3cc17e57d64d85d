ARM: dts: gemini: Re-enable display controller

commit 137cd7100ec6fa36d610e106df00acb4d8af99df
"ARM: dts: Enable Gemini flash access" contained a bug
by disabling the display controller, while the whole
idea with the patch was to enable flash access AND
the display controller, simultaneously. Fix it up.
