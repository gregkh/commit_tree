tracing: Use dyn_event framework for synthetic events

Use dyn_event framework for synthetic events. This shows
synthetic events on "tracing/dynamic_events" file in addition
to tracing/synthetic_events interface.

User can also define new events via tracing/dynamic_events
with "s:" prefix. So, the new syntax is below;

  s:[synthetic/]EVENT_NAME TYPE ARG; [TYPE ARG;]...

To remove events via tracing/dynamic_events, you can use
"-:" prefix as same as other events.
