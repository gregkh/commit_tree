tun: move the call to tun_set_real_num_queues

Call tun_set_real_num_queues() after the increment of tun->numqueues
since the former depends on it. Otherwise, the number of queues is not
correctly accounted for, which results to warnings similar to:
"vnet0 selects TX queue 11, but real number of TX queues is 11".
