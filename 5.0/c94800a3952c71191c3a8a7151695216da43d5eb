ALSA: hda/tegra: compatible string as shortname

By default HDA sound card is registered with shortname "tegra-hda".
Same driver is used across tegra platforms and it is necessary to
distinguish between platforms to use platform specific settings from
userspace. One such example is, hdmi port on different platforms use
different alsa pcm device ID. For hdmi playback to work it should
open correct pcm device depending on the platform.

This patch applies shortname from first compatible string provided
in root node of device tree. Userspace then can use this card name
to apply specific settings.
