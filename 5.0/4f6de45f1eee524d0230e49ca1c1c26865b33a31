ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabreauto: Enable pcie

The imx6qdl-sabreauto boards have a pcie slot so let's enable it.

Tested on imx6dl-sabreauto with an atk9k wifi card; scanning works.

There are unhandled differences for imx6qp but imx6qp-sabreauto.dts
already contains a snippet explicitly disabling the &pcie node so that
can be dealt with later.
