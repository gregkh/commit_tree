bpf: don't assume build-id length is always 20 bytes

Build-id length is not fixed to 20, it can be (`man ld` /--build-id):
  * 128-bit (uuid)
  * 160-bit (sha1)
  * any length specified in ld --build-id=0xhexstring

To fix the issue of missing BPF_STACK_BUILD_ID_VALID for shorter build-ids,
assume that build-id is somewhere in the range of 1 .. 20.
Set the remaining bytes to zero.

v2:
* don't introduce new "len = min(BPF_BUILD_ID_SIZE, nhdr->n_descsz)",
  we already know that nhdr->n_descsz <= BPF_BUILD_ID_SIZE if we enter
  this 'if' condition
