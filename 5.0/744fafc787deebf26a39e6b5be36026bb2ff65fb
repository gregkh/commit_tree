perf trace: See if there is a map named "filtered_pids"

Lookup for the first map named "filtered_pids" and, if augmenting
syscalls, i.e. if a BPF event is present and the
"__augmented_syscalls__" is present, then fill in that map with the pids
to filter, be it feedback loop ones (perf trace's pid, its father if it
is "sshd", more auto-filtered in the future) or the ones explicitely
stated in the tool command line via --filter-pids.

The code to actually fill in the map comes next.
