mm, memory_hotplug: __offline_pages fix wrong locking

Jan has noticed that we do double unlock on some failure paths when
offlining a page range.  This is indeed the case when
test_pages_in_a_zone respp.  start_isolate_page_range fail.  This was an
omission when forward porting the debugging patch from an older kernel.

Fix the issue by dropping mem_hotplug_done from the failure condition
and keeping the single unlock in the catch all failure path.
