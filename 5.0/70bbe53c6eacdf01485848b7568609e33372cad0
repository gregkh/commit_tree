drm/i915: Make sure fb gtt offsets stay within 32bits

Let's try to make sure the fb offset computations never hit
an integer overflow by making sure the entire fb stays
below 32bits. framebuffer_check() in the core already does
the same check, but as it doesn't know about tiling some things
can slip through. Repeat the check in the driver with tiling
taken into account.

v2: Use add_overflows() after massaging it to work for me (Chris)
v3: Call it add_overflow_t() to match min_t() & co. (Chris)
