net: hns3: ignore new coming low-level reset while doing high-level reset

When processing a higher level reset, the pending lower level reset
does not have to be processed anymore, because the higher level
reset is the superset of the lower level reset.

Therefore, when processing an higher level reset, the request of
lower level reset needs to be cleared.
