staging: comedi: drivers: Cleanup malformed licence identifier

This patch fixes multiple occurences of the checkpatch.pl warning:
WARNING: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

NB. This is an additional patch and does not overlap the patch sent
yesterday for 8255.h. Should have sent them all together.
Newb mistake.
