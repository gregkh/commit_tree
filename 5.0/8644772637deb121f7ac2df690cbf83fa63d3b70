mm: Use fixed constant in page_frag_alloc instead of size + 1

This patch replaces the size + 1 value introduced with the recent fix for 1
byte allocs with a constant value.

The idea here is to reduce code overhead as the previous logic would have
to read size into a register, then increment it, and write it back to
whatever field was being used. By using a constant we can avoid those
memory reads and arithmetic operations in favor of just encoding the
maximum value into the operation itself.
