ALSA: fireface: share register for async transaction of MIDI messages

As long as investigating packet dumps from Fireface 400/800, a register
to receive asynchronous transactions for MIDI messages is the same. For
Fireface 800, minor register is used.

This commit declares macros for the transactions and obsoletes
model-specific parameters.
