clk: meson: meson8b: run from the XTAL when changing the CPU frequency

Changing the CPU clock requires changing various clocks including the
SYS PLL. The existing meson clk-pll and clk-regmap drivers can change
all of the relevant clocks already.
However, changing for exampe the SYS PLL is problematic because as long
as the CPU is running off a clock derived from SYS PLL changing the
latter results in a full system lockup.
Fix this system lockup by switching the CPU clock to run off the XTAL
while we are changing the any of the clocks in the CPU clock tree.
