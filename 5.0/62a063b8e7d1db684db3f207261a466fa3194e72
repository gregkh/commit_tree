nfsd4: fix crash on writing v4_end_grace before nfsd startup

Anatoly Trosinenko reports that this:

1) Checkout fresh master Linux branch (tested with commit e195ca6cb)
2) Copy x84_64-config-4.14 to .config, then enable NFS server v4 and build
3) From `kvm-xfstests shell`:

results in NULL dereference in locks_end_grace.

Check that nfsd has been started before trying to end the grace period.
