scsi: lpfc: nvmet: avoid hang / use-after-free when destroying targetport

We cannot wait on a completion object in the lpfc_nvme_targetport structure
in the _destroy_targetport() code path because the NVMe/fc transport will
free that structure immediately after the .targetport_delete() callback.
This results in a use-after-free, and a hang if slub_debug=FZPU is enabled.

Fix this by putting the completion on the stack.
