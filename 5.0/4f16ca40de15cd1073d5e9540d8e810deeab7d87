ARM: dts: sun8i-h3: Add dts for the Mapleboard MP130

The Mapleboard MP130 is a single board computer based on the Allwinner
H3 SoC, with all schematics freely available. The Lite version includes
1GB main memory and 8GB eMMC.

is selected)

This DTS is based upon the DTS shipped with the board which uses
mapleboard,mp130- prefixes instead of the allwinner,sun8i variants.
