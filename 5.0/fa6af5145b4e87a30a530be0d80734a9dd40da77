drm/i915: Force a LUT update in intel_initial_commit()

If we force a plane update to fix up our half populated plane state
we'll also force on the pipe gamma for the plane (since we always
enable pipe gamma currently). If the BIOS hasn't programmed a sensible
LUT into the hardware this will cause the image to become corrupted.
Typical symptoms are a purple/yellow/etc. flash when the driver loads.

To avoid this let's program something sensible into the LUT when
we do the plane update. In the future I plan to add proper plane
gamma enable readout so this is just a temporary measure.
