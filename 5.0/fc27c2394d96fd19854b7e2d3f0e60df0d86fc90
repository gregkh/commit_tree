clk: mmp2: add SP clock

The "security processor", sometimes referred to as "wireless trusted
module" or "generic encrypt unit" is a low-power core present on MMP2,
that has nothing to do with security, wireless, trust or encryption.

On an OLPC machine it runs CForth and serves as a keyboard controller:

The register address was obtained from the OLPC kernel, since the
datasheet seems to be the Marvell's most important business secret.
