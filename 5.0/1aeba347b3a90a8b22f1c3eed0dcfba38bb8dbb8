MIPS: Hardcode cpu_has_mips* where target ISA allows

In the same vein as commit 93e01942a6eb ("MIPS: Hardcode cpu_has_* where
known at compile time due to ISA"), we can use our knowledge of the ISA
being targeted by the kernel build to make cpu_has_mips* macros
compile-time constant in some cases. This allows the compiler greater
opportunity to optimize out code which will never execute.
