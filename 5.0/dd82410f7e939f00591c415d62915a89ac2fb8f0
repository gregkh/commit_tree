ASoC: simple-card: tidyup convert_rate/channel method

Current simple-card is handling "convert_rate/channel"
by many ways. But, it is not useful and readable.
We want to do is that allow having it everywere.
This patch support it.
It will be overwrote if lower node has it.

sound {
	simple-audio-card,convert_channels = <xxx>; // initial

	simple-audio-card,dai-link {
		convert_channels = <xxx>; // overwrite
		cpu {
			convert_channels = <xxx>; // overwrite
		};
		codec {
			convert_channels = <xxx>; // overwrite
		};
	};
};
