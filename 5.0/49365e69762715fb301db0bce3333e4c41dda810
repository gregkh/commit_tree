btrfs: silence warning if replace is canceled

When we successfully cancel the device replace, its scrub worker returns
-ECANCELED, which is then passed to btrfs_dev_replace_finishing.

It cleans up based on the returned status and propagates the same
-ECANCELED back the parent function. As of now only user can cancel the
replace-scrub, so its ok to silence the warning here.
