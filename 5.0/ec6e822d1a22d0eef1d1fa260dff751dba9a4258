arm64: expose user PAC bit positions via ptrace

When pointer authentication is in use, data/instruction pointers have a
number of PAC bits inserted into them. The number and position of these
bits depends on the configured TCR_ELx.TxSZ and whether tagging is
enabled. ARMv8.3 allows tagging to differ for instruction and data
pointers.

For userspace debuggers to unwind the stack and/or to follow pointer
chains, they need to be able to remove the PAC bits before attempting to
use a pointer.

This patch adds a new structure with masks describing the location of
the PAC bits in userspace instruction and data pointers (i.e. those
addressable via TTBR0), which userspace can query via PTRACE_GETREGSET.
By clearing these bits from pointers (and replacing them with the value
of bit 55), userspace can acquire the PAC-less versions.

This new regset is exposed when the kernel is built with (user) pointer
authentication support, and the address authentication feature is
enabled. Otherwise, the regset is hidden.
