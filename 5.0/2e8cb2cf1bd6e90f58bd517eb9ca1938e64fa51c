PCI: Fix PCI kconfig menu organization

After commit eb01d42a7778 ("PCI: consolidate PCI config entry in
drivers/pci"), all the PCI kconfig options appear below "PCI support"
rather than within a sub-menu.  This is because menuconfig expects all
kconfig entries to be enclosed in an if/endif section.  Add the missing
if/endif.

With this, "depends on PCI" is redundant in the sub-menu  entries and can
be removed.
