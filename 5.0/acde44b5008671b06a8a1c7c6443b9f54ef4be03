drm/i915: Move FBC init and cleanup calls to modeset functions

Although FBC helps save power it do not belongs to power management
also the cleanup was placed in i915_driver_unload() also not a good
place. intel_modeset_init()/intel_modeset_cleanup() are better places
also this will help make easy disable features that depends in
display being enabled in driver.
