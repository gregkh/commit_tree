scsi: isci: remote_device: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases where
we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that, in this particular case, a dash is added as a token in order
to separate the "fall through" annotations from the rest of the comment on
the same line, which is what GCC is expecting to find.
