MIPS: Use Kconfig to select CPU_NO_EFFICIENT_FFS

Select CONFIG_CPU_NO_EFFICIENT_FFS via Kconfig when the kernel is
configured for a pre-MIPS32r1 CPU, rather than defining its equivalent
in asm/cpu-features.h based upon overrides of cpu_has_mips* macros.

The latter only works if a platform has an cpu-feature-overrides.h
header which defines cpu_has_mips* macros, which are not generally
needed. There are many cases where we know that the target ISA for a
kernel build is MIPS32r1 or later & thus includes the CLZ instruction,
without requiring any overrides from the platform. Using Kconfig allows
us to take those into account, and more naturally make a decision about
instruction support using information about the target ISA.
