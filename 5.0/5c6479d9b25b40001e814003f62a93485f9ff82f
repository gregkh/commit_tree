arm64: dts: renesas: r8a7799{0|5}: add/enable USB2.0 peripheral

This patch adds/enables USB2.0 peripheral for R-Car [DE]3 boards.

R-Car E3 Ebisu board connects the ID pin to the SoC, so this adds
a group "usb0_id" into usb0_pins node. Also, to use SW15 pin 3 side,
this patch adds vbus0_usb2 node on r8a77990-ebisu.dts.

R-Car D3 Draak board doesn't connect the ID pin, so this adds
"renesas,no-otg-pins" property into usb2_phy0 node.
