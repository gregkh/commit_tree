net: aquantia: add vlan id to rx flow filters

The VLAN filter (VLAN id) is compared against 16 filters.
VLAN id must be accompanied by mask 0xF000. That is to distinguish
VLAN filter from L2 Ethertype filter with UserPriority since both
User Priority and VLAN ID are passed in the same 'vlan' parameter.
Flow type may be any as  it is not matched for VLAN filter.
Due to fixed order of the rules in the NIC, the location 0-15 are
reserved for vlan filters.

Example:
To add a rule that directs packets from VLAN 2001 to queue 5:
ethtool -N <ethX> flow-type ip4 vlan 2001 m 0xF000 action 5 loc 0
