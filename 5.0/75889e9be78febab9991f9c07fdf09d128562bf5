kconfig: remove unneeded setsym label in conf_read_simple()

The two 'goto setsym' statements are reachable only when sym == NULL.

The code below the 'setsym:' label does nothing when sym == NULL
since there is just one if-block guarded by 'if (sym && ...)'.

Hence, 'goto setsym' can be replaced with 'continue'.
