{net, IB}/mlx4: Initialize CQ buffers in the driver when possible

Perform CQ initialization in the driver when the capability is supported
by the FW.  When passing the CQ to HW indicate that the CQ buffer has
been pre-initialized.

Doing so decreases CQ creation time.  Testing on P8 showed a single 2048
entry CQ creation time was reduced from ~395us to ~170us, which is
2.3x faster.
