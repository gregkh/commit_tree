iio: adc: Add ad7124 support

The ad7124-4 and ad7124-8 are a family of 4 and 8 channel sigma-delta ADCs
with 24-bit precision and reference.

Three power modes are available which in turn affect the output data rate:
 * Full power: 9.38 SPS to 19,200 SPS
 * Mid power: 2.34 SPS to 4800 SPS
 * Low power: 1.17 SPS to 2400 SPS

The ad7124-4 can be configured to have four differential inputs, while
ad7124-8 can have 8. Moreover, ad7124 also supports per channel
configuration. Each configuration consists of gain, reference source,
output data rate and bipolar/unipolar configuration.
