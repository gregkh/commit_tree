usb: hub: delay hub autosuspend if USB3 port is still link training

When initializing a hub we want to give a USB3 port in link training
the same debounce delay time before autosuspening the hub as already
trained, connected enabled ports.

USB3 ports won't reach the enabled state with "current connect status" and
"connect status change" bits set until the USB3 link training finishes.

Catching the port in link training (polling) and adding the debounce delay
prevents unnecessary failed attempts to autosuspend the hub.
