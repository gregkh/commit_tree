net: phy: add phy_check_link_status

In few places in the state machine the state is set to PHY_RUNNING or
PHY_NOLINK after doing a phy_read_status(). So factor this out to
phy_check_link_status().

First use it in phy_start_aneg(): By setting the state to PHY_RUNNING
or PHY_NOLINK directly we can remove the code to handle the case that
we're using interrupts and aneg was finished already.

Definition of phy_link_up and phy_link_down needs to be moved because
they are called in the new function.
