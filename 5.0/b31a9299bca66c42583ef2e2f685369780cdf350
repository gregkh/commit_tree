spi: bcm2835: Polish transfer of DMA prologue

Commit 3bd7f6589f67 ("spi: bcm2835: Overcome sglist entry length
limitation") was unfortunately merged even though submission of a
refined version was imminent.  Apply those refinements as an amendment:

* Drop no longer needed #include <asm/page.h>.  The lines requiring
  its inclusion were removed by the commit.

* Change type of tx_spillover flag from bool to unsigned int for
  consistency with dma_pending flag and pursuant to Linus' dictum:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/21/384

* In bcm2835_rd_fifo_count() do not check for bs->rx_buf != NULL.
  The function will never be called if that's the case.

* Amend kerneldoc of bcm2835_wait_tx_fifo_empty() to prevent its use in
  situations where the function might spin forever.  (In response to a
  review comment by Stefan Wahren.)

* Sync only the cacheline containing the RX prologue back to memory,
  not the full first sglist entry.

* Use sg_dma_address() and sg_dma_len() instead of referencing the
  sglist entry members directly.  Seems to be the more common syntax in
  the tree, even for lvalues.
