fanotify: introduce new event mask FAN_OPEN_EXEC

A new event mask FAN_OPEN_EXEC has been defined so that users have the
ability to receive events specifically when a file has been opened with
the intent to be executed. Events of FAN_OPEN_EXEC type will be
generated when a file has been opened using either execve(), execveat()
or uselib() system calls.

The feature is implemented within fsnotify_open() by generating the
FAN_OPEN_EXEC event type if __FMODE_EXEC is set within file->f_flags.
