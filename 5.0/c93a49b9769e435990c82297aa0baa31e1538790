ipvs: fix warning on unused variable

When CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6 is not defined, build produced this warning:

net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_ctl.c:899:6: warning: unused variable ‘ret’ [-Wunused-variable]
  int ret = 0;
      ^~~

Fix this by moving the declaration of 'ret' in the CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6
section in the same function.

While at it, drop its unneeded initialisation.
