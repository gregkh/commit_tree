ASoC: topology: fix oops/use-after-free case with dai driver

rmmod/modprobe tests expose a kernel oops when accessing the dai
driver pointer. This comes from the topology design which operates in
multiple passes. Each object removal happens at a specific iteration,
and the code checks for the iteration (order) number after the memory
containing the order was freed.

Fix this be clearing a reference to the dai driver and check its
validity to avoid dereferences.
