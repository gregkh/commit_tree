i3c: master: dw: fix deadlock

In dw_i3c_master_irq_handler(), we already have gotten
&master->xferqueue.lock, if we try to get the same lock again in
dw_i3c_master_dequeue_xfer(), deadlock happens.

We fix this issue by introduing dw_i3c_master_dequeue_xfer_locked()
which does all what dw_i3c_master_dequeue_xfer() does without trying
to lock &master->xferqueue.lock.
