net/mlx5e: XDP, Precede XDP-related operations in RQ poll by a loaded program check

At the end of the RQ polling loop, some XDP-related operations
might be required. Before checking them one by one, check if
an XDP program is even loaded.
Combine all the checks and operations in a single function in xdp files.

This saves unnecessary checks for non-XDP flows.
