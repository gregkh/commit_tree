net: dsa: bcm_sf2: potential array overflow in bcm_sf2_sw_suspend()

The value of ->num_ports comes from bcm_sf2_sw_probe() and it is less
than or equal to DSA_MAX_PORTS.  The ds->ports[] array is used inside
the dsa_is_user_port() and dsa_is_cpu_port() functions.  The ds->ports[]
array is allocated in dsa_switch_alloc() and it has ds->num_ports
elements so this leads to a static checker warning about a potential out
of bounds read.
