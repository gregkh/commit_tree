mm: convert totalram_pages and totalhigh_pages variables to atomic

totalram_pages and totalhigh_pages are made static inline function.

Main motivation was that managed_page_count_lock handling was complicating
things.  It was discussed in length here,
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/995739/#1181785 So it seemes
better to remove the lock and convert variables to atomic, with preventing
poteintial store-to-read tearing as a bonus.
