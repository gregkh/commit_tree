batman-adv: release station info tidstats

With the addition of TXQ stats in the per-tid statistics the struct
station_info grew significantly. This resulted in stack size warnings
due to the structure itself being above the limit for the warnings.

To work around this, the TID array was allocated dynamically. Also a
function to free this content was introduced with commit 7ea3e110f2f8
("cfg80211: release station info tidstats where needed") but the necessary
changes were not provided for batman-adv's B.A.T.M.A.N. V implementation.
