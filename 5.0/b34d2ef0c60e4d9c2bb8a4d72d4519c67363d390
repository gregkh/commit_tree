arm64: mm: purge lazily unmapped vm regions before changing permissions

Call vm_unmap_aliases() every time we apply any changes to permission
attributes of mappings in the vmalloc region. This avoids any potential
issues resulting from lingering writable or executable aliases of
mappings that should be read-only or non-executable, respectively.
