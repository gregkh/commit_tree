mmc: cqhci: fix space allocated for transfer descriptor

There is not enough space being allocated when DCMD is disabled.

CQE_DCMD is not necessary to be enabled when CQE is enabled.
(Software could halt CQE to send command)

In the case that CQE_DCMD is not enabled, it still needs to allocate
space for data transfer. For instance:
  CQE_DCMD is enabled:  31 slots space (one slot used by DCMD)
  CQE_DCMD is disabled: 32 slots space
