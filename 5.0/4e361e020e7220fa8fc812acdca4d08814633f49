bcache: update comment in sysfs.c

We have struct cached_dev allocated by kzalloc in register_bcache(),
which initializes all the fields of cached_dev with 0s. And commit
ce4c3e19e520 ("bcache: Replace bch_read_string_list() by
__sysfs_match_string()") has remove the string "default".

Update the comment.
