wil6210: notify cqm packet loss on disable_ap_sme

wil6210 used to notify cfg80211_del_sta on every fw disconnect event.
In disable_ap_sme mode the userspace manages the protocol SME and
FW sends disconnect event only due to link loss.

In disable_ap_sme mode, indicate CQM packet loss to let the host
control the connection and disconnect the link if needed.
