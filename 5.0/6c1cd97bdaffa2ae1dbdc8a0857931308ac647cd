drm/virtio: fix resource id handling

Move virtio_gpu_resource_id_{get,put} to virtgpu_object.c and make them
static.  Allocate and free the id on creation and destroy, drop all
other calls.  That way objects have a valid handle for the whole
lifetime of the object.

Also fixes ids leaking.  Worst offender are dumb buffers, and I think
some error paths too.
