dt-bindings: power: Introduce properties to present the battery OCV capacity table

Some battery driver will use the open circuit voltage (OCV) value to look
up the corresponding battery capacity percent in one certain degree Celsius.
Thus this patch provides some battery properties to present the OCV table
temperatures and OCV capacity table values.
