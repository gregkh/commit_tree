kernel/hung_task.c: force console verbose before panic

Based on commit 401c636a0eeb ("kernel/hung_task.c: show all hung tasks
before panic"), we could get the call stack of hung task.

However, if the console loglevel is not high, we still can not see the
useful panic information in practice, and in most cases users don't set
console loglevel to high level.

This patch is to force console verbose before system panic, so that the
real useful information can be seen in the console, instead of being
like the following, which doesn't have hung task information.

  INFO: task init:1 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
        Tainted: G     U  W         4.19.0-quilt-2e5dc0ac-g51b6c21d76cc #1
  "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.
