btrfs: Remove extent_io_ops::merge_extent_hook callback

This callback is used only for data and free space inodes. Such inodes
are guaranteed to have their extent_io_tree::private_data set to the
inode struct. Exploit this fact to directly call the function. Also give
it a more descriptive name. No functional changes.
