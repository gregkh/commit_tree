linkage: add generic GLOBAL() macro

Declaring a global symbol in assembly is tedious, error-prone, and
painful to read. While ENTRY() exists, this is supposed to be used for
function entry points, and this affects alignment in a potentially
undesireable manner.

Instead, let's add a generic GLOBAL() macro for this, as x86 added
locally in commit:

  95695547a7db44b8 ("x86: asm linkage - introduce GLOBAL macro")

... thus allowing us to use this more freely in the kernel.
