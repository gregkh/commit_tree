s390/qeth: replace open-coded cmd setup

Call qeth_prepare_ipa_cmd() during setup of a new IPA cmd buffer, so
that it is used for all commands. Thus ARP and SNMP requests don't have
to do their own initialization.

This will now also set the proper MPC protocol version for SNMP requests
on L2 devices.
