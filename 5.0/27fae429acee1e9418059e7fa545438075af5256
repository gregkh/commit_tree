sbitmap: don't loop for find_next_zero_bit() for !round_robin

If we aren't forced to do round robin tag allocation, just use the
allocation hint to find the index for the tag word, don't use it for the
offset inside the word. This avoids a potential extra round trip in the
bit looping, and since we're fetching this cacheline, we may as well
check the whole word from the start.
