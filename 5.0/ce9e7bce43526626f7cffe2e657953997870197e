scsi: ufs: Fix system suspend status

hba->is_sys_suspended is set after successful system suspend but
not clear after successful system resume.

According to current behavior, hba->is_sys_suspended will not be set if
host is runtime-suspended but not system-suspended. Thus we shall aligh the
same policy: clear this flag even if host remains runtime-suspended after
ufshcd_system_resume is successfully returned.

Simply fix this flag to correct host status logs.
