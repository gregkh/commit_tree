dt-bindings: net: broadcom-bluetooth: Add VBAT and VDDIO supplies

The Broadcom Bluetooth chips have two power inputs, VBAT and VDDIO.
The former provides overall power for the chip, while the latter powers
the I/O pins and buffers.

This patch adds properties for the two so we can describe the power
supply relationships.
