crypto: drop mask=CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC from 'shash' tfm allocations

'shash' algorithms are always synchronous, so passing CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC
in the mask to crypto_alloc_shash() has no effect.  Many users therefore
already don't pass it, but some still do.  This inconsistency can cause
confusion, especially since the way the 'mask' argument works is
somewhat counterintuitive.

Thus, just remove the unneeded CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC flags.

This patch shouldn't change any actual behavior.
