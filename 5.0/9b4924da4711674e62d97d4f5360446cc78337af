pinctrl: xway: fix gpio-hog related boot issues

This patch is based on commit a86caa9ba5d7 ("pinctrl: msm: fix gpio-hog
related boot issues").

It fixes the issue that the gpio ranges needs to be defined before
gpiochip_add().

Therefore, we also have to swap the order of registering the pinctrl
driver and registering the gpio chip.

You also have to add the "gpio-ranges" property to the pinctrl device
node to get it finally working.
