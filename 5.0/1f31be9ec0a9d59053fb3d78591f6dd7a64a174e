kconfig: loosen the order of "visible" and "depends on" in menu entry

Currently, "visible" and "depends on", if defined in a menu entry,
must appear in that order.

The real example is in drivers/media/tuners/Kconfig:

  menu "Customize TV tuners"
          visible if <expr1>
          depends on <expr2>

... is fine, but you cannot change the property order like this:

  menu "Customize TV tuners"
          depends on <expr2>
          visible if <expr1>

Kconfig does not require a specific order of properties. In this case,
menu_add_visibility(() and menu_add_dep() are orthogonal.

Loosen this unreasonable restriction.
