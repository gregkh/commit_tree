kvm: vmx: Allow guest read access to IA32_TSC

Let the guest read the IA32_TSC MSR with the generic RDMSR instruction
as well as the specific RDTSC(P) instructions. Note that the hardware
applies the TSC multiplier and offset (when applicable) to the result of
RDMSR(IA32_TSC), just as it does to the result of RDTSC(P).
