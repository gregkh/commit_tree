fs/dcache: Fix incorrect nr_dentry_unused accounting in shrink_dcache_sb()

The nr_dentry_unused per-cpu counter tracks dentries in both the LRU
lists and the shrink lists where the DCACHE_LRU_LIST bit is set.

The shrink_dcache_sb() function moves dentries from the LRU list to a
shrink list and subtracts the dentry count from nr_dentry_unused.  This
is incorrect as the nr_dentry_unused count will also be decremented in
shrink_dentry_list() via d_shrink_del().

To fix this double decrement, the decrement in the shrink_dcache_sb()
function is taken out.
