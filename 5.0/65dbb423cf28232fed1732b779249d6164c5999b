ARM: cns3xxx: Fix writing to wrong PCI config registers after alignment

Originally, cns3xxx used its own functions for mapping, reading and
writing config registers.

Commit 802b7c06adc7 ("ARM: cns3xxx: Convert PCI to use generic config
accessors") removed the internal PCI config write function in favor of
the generic one:

  cns3xxx_pci_write_config() --> pci_generic_config_write()

cns3xxx_pci_write_config() expected aligned addresses, being produced by
cns3xxx_pci_map_bus() while the generic one pci_generic_config_write()
actually expects the real address as both the function and hardware are
capable of byte-aligned writes.

This currently leads to pci_generic_config_write() writing to the wrong
registers.

For instance, upon ath9k module loading:

- driver ath9k gets loaded
- The driver wants to write value 0xA8 to register PCI_LATENCY_TIMER,
  located at 0x0D
- cns3xxx_pci_map_bus() aligns the address to 0x0C
- pci_generic_config_write() effectively writes 0xA8 into register 0x0C
  (CACHE_LINE_SIZE)

Fix the bug by removing the alignment in the cns3xxx mapping function.
