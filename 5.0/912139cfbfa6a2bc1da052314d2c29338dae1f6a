x86/microcode/amd: Don't falsely trick the late loading mechanism

The load_microcode_amd() function searches for microcode patches and
attempts to apply a microcode patch if it is of different level than the
currently installed level.

While the processor won't actually load a level that is less than
what is already installed, the logic wrongly returns UCODE_NEW thus
signaling to its caller reload_store() that a late loading should be
attempted.

If the file-system contains an older microcode revision than what is
currently running, such a late microcode reload can result in these
misleading messages:

  x86/CPU: CPU features have changed after loading microcode, but might not take effect.
  x86/CPU: Please consider either early loading through initrd/built-in or a potential BIOS update.

These messages were issued on a system where SME/SEV are not
enabled by the BIOS (MSR C001_0010[23] = 0b) because during boot,
early_detect_mem_encrypt() is called and cleared the SME and SEV
features in this case.

However, after the wrong late load attempt, get_cpu_cap() is called and
reloads the SME and SEV feature bits, resulting in the messages.

Update the microcode level check to not attempt microcode loading if the
current level is greater than(!) and not only equal to the current patch
level.
