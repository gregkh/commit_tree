ACPICA: Debug output: Add option to display method/object evaluation

Adds entry/exit messages for all objects that are evaluated.
Works for the kernel-level code as well as acpiexec. The "-eo"
flag enables acpiexec to display these messages.

The messages are very useful when debugging the flow of table
initialization.
