powerpc/radix: Fix kernel crash with mremap()

With support for split pmd lock, we use pmd page pmd_huge_pte pointer
to store the deposited page table. In those config when we move page
tables we need to make sure we move the deposited page table to the
correct pmd page. Otherwise this can result in crash when we withdraw
of deposited page table because we can find the pmd_huge_pte NULL.

eg:

  __split_huge_pmd+0x1070/0x1940
  __split_huge_pmd+0xe34/0x1940 (unreliable)
  vma_adjust_trans_huge+0x110/0x1c0
  __vma_adjust+0x2b4/0x9b0
  __split_vma+0x1b8/0x280
  __do_munmap+0x13c/0x550
  sys_mremap+0x220/0x7e0
  system_call+0x5c/0x70
