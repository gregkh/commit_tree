selftests/seccomp: Enhance per-arch ptrace syscall skip tests

Passing EPERM during syscall skipping was confusing since the test wasn't
actually exercising the errno evaluation -- it was just passing a literal
"1" (EPERM). Instead, expand the tests to check both direct value returns
(positive, 45000 in this case), and errno values (negative, -ESRCH in this
case) to check both fake success and fake failure during syscall skipping.
