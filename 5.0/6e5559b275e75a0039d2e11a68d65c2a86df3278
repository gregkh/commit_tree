RDMA/rxe: Add link_down, rdma_sends, rdma_recvs stats counters

link_down is self-explanatory.

rdma_sends and rdma_recvs count the number of RDMA Send and RDMA Receive
operations completed successfully. This is different from the existing
sent_pkts and rcvd_pkts counters because the existing counters measure
packets, not RDMA operations.

ack_deffered is renamed to ack_deferred to fix the spelling.

out_of_sequence is renamed to out_of_seq_request to make clear that it is
counting only requests and not other packets which can be out of sequence.
