btrfs: Remove fsid/metadata_fsid fields from btrfs_info

Currently btrfs_fs_info structure contains a copy of the
fsid/metadata_uuid fields. Same values are also contained in the
btrfs_fs_devices structure which fs_info has a reference to. Let's
reduce duplication by removing the fields from fs_info and always refer
to the ones in fs_devices. No functional changes.
