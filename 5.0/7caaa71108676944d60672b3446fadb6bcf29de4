KVM: VMX: Pass vmx_capability struct to setup_vmcs_config()

...instead of referencing the global struct.  This will allow moving
setup_vmcs_config() to a separate file that may not have access to
the global variable.  Modify nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs() appropriately
since vmx_capability.ept may not be accurate when called by
vmx_check_processor_compat().

No functional change intended.
