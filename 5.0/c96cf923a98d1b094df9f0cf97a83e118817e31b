tty: Don't block on IO when ldisc change is pending

There might be situations where tty_ldisc_lock() has blocked, but there
is already IO on tty and it prevents line discipline changes.
It might theoretically turn into dead-lock.

Basically, provide more priority to pending tty_ldisc_lock() than to
servicing reads/writes over tty.

User-visible issue was reported by Mikulas where on pa-risc with
Debian 5 reboot took either 80 seconds, 3 minutes or 3:25 after proper
locking in tty_reopen().
