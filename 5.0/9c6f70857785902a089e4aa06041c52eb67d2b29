net: hns3: add reset_hdev to reinit the hdev in VF's reset process

When doing reset, the reset handling function only need to
reinitialize hardware, it makes sense to add a function to
do that job. Also the error handling of hclgevf_init_hdev is
different when it is used in reset process.

This patch adds reset_hdev to reinitialize hardware when resetting.
Also, this patch removes the hclgevf_dev_ongoing_full_reset because
it is unused now.
