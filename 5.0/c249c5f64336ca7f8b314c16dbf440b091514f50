drm/i915: Handle cursor updating active_planes correctly, v2.

While we may not update new_crtc_state, we may clear active_planes
if the new cursor update state will disable the cursor, but we fail
after. If this is immediately followed by a modeset disable, we may
soon not disable the planes correctly when we start depending on
active_planes.

Changes since v1:
- Clarify why we cannot swap crtc_state. (Matt)
