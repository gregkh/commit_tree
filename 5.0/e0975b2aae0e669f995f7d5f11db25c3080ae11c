mm, fault_around: do not take a reference to a locked page

filemap_map_pages takes a speculative reference to each page in the range
before it tries to lock that page.  While this is correct it also can
influence page migration which will bail out when seeing an elevated
reference count.  The faultaround code would bail on seeing a locked page
so we can pro-actively check the PageLocked bit before
page_cache_get_speculative and prevent from pointless reference count
churn.
