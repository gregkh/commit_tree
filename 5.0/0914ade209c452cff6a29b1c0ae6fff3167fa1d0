x86/ima: define arch_ima_get_secureboot

Distros are concerned about totally disabling the kexec_load syscall.
As a compromise, the kexec_load syscall will only be disabled when
CONFIG_KEXEC_VERIFY_SIG is configured and the system is booted with
secureboot enabled.

This patch defines the new arch specific function called
arch_ima_get_secureboot() to retrieve the secureboot state of the system.
