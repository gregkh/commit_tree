btrfs: Move epd::extent_locked check to writepage_delalloc's caller

If epd::extent_locked is set then writepage_delalloc terminates. Make
this a bit more apparent in the caller by simply bubbling the check up.
This enables to remove epd as an argument to writepage_delalloc in a
future patch. No functional change.
