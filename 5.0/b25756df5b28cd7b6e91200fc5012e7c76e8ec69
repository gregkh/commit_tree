perf session: Add comment for perf_session__register_idle_thread()

Add a comment to perf_session__register_idle_thread() to bring attention to
a pitfall with the idle task thread structure. The pitfall is that there
should really be a 'struct thread' for the idle task of each cpu, but there
is only one that can have pid == tid == 0.
