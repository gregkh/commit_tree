igb: reduce CPU0 latency when updating statistics

This change is based off of the work and suggestion of Jan Jablonsky
<jan.jablonsky@thalesgroup.com>.

The Watchdog workqueue in igb driver is scheduled every 2s for each
network interface. That includes updating a statistics protected by
spinlock. Function igb_update_stats in this case will be protected
against preemption. According to number of a statistics registers
(cca 60), processing this function might cause additional cpu load
 on CPU0.

In case of statistics spinlock may be replaced with mutex, which
reduce latency on CPU0.
