tools include uapi: Grab a copy of linux/mount.h

We were using a copy of uapi/linux/fs.h to create the mount syscall
'flags' string table to use in 'perf trace', to convert from the number
obtained via the raw_syscalls:sys_enter into a string, using
tools/perf/trace/beauty/mount_flags.sh, but in e262e32d6bde ("vfs:
Suppress MS_* flag defs within the kernel unless explicitly enabled")
those defines got moved to linux/mount.h, so grab a copy of mount.h too.

Keep the uapi/linux/fs.h as we'll use it for the SEEK_ constants.
