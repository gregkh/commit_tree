bpftool: make libbfd optional

Make it possible to build bpftool without libbfd. libbfd and libopcodes are
typically provided in dev/dbg packages (binutils-dev in debian) which we
usually don't have installed on the fleet machines and we'd like a way to have
bpftool version that works without installing any additional packages.
This excludes support for disassembling jit-ted code and prints an error if
the user tries to use these features.

Tested by:
cat > FEATURES_DUMP.bpftool <<EOF
feature-libbfd=0
feature-disassembler-four-args=1
feature-reallocarray=0
feature-libelf=1
feature-libelf-mmap=1
feature-bpf=1
EOF
FEATURES_DUMP=$PWD/FEATURES_DUMP.bpftool make
ldd bpftool | grep libbfd
