bpf: fix null pointer dereference on pointer offload

Pointer offload is being null checked however the following statement
dereferences the potentially null pointer offload when assigning
offload->dev_state.  Fix this by only assigning it if offload is not
null.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1475437 ("Dereference after null check")

Fixes: 00db12c3d141 ("bpf: call verifier_prep from its callback in struct bpf_offload_dev")
