drm/i915: Use i915_gem_object_get_dma_address() to populate rotated vmas

Replace the kvmalloc_array() with i915_gem_object_get_dma_address() when
populating rotated vmas. One random access mechanism ought to be enough
for everyone?

To calculate the size of the radix tree I think we can do
something like this (assuming 64bit pointers):
 num_pages = obj_size / 4096
 tree_height = ceil(log64(num_pages))
 num_nodes = sum(64^n, n, 0, tree_height-1)
 tree_size = num_nodes * 576

If we compare that with the object size we should get a relative
overhead of around .2% to 1% for reasonable sized objects,
which framebuffers tend to be.
