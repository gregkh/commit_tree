arm64: mm: Introduce DEFAULT_MAP_WINDOW

We wish to introduce a 52-bit virtual address space for userspace but
maintain compatibility with software that assumes the maximum VA space
size is 48 bit.

In order to achieve this, on 52-bit VA systems, we make mmap behave as
if it were running on a 48-bit VA system (unless userspace explicitly
requests a VA where addr[51:48] != 0).

On a system running a 52-bit userspace we need TASK_SIZE to represent
the 52-bit limit as it is used in various places to distinguish between
kernelspace and userspace addresses.

Thus we need a new limit for mmap, stack, ELF loader and EFI (which uses
TTBR0) to represent the non-extended VA space.

This patch introduces DEFAULT_MAP_WINDOW and DEFAULT_MAP_WINDOW_64 and
switches the appropriate logic to use that instead of TASK_SIZE.
