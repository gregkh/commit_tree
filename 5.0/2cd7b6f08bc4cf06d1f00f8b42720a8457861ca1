drm/virtio: add in/out fence support for explicit synchronization

When the execbuf call receives an in-fence it will get the dma_fence
related to that fence fd and wait on it before submitting the draw call.

On the out-fence side we get fence returned by the submitted draw call
and attach it to a sync_file and send the sync_file fd to userspace. On
error -1 is returned to userspace.

VIRTGPU_EXECBUF_FENCE_FD_IN & VIRTGPU_EXECBUF_FENCE_FD_OUT
are supported at the simultaneously and can be flagged
for simultaneously.
