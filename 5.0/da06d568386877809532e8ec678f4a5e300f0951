perf top: Fix wrong hottest instruction highlighted

The annotation line percentage is compared and inserted into the rbtree,
but the percent field of 'struct annotation_data' is an array, the
comparison result between them is the address difference.

This patch compares the right slot of percent array according to
opts->percent_type and makes things right.

The problem can be reproduced by pressing 'H' in perf top annotation view.
It should highlight the instruction line which has the highest sampling
percentage.
