regulator: core: Add new max_uV_step constraint

On NVIDIA Tegra30 there is a requirement for regulator "A" to have voltage
higher than voltage of regulator "B" by N microvolts, the N value changes
depending on the voltage of regulator "B". This is similar to min-spread
between voltages of regulators, the difference is that the spread value
isn't fixed. This means that extra carefulness is required for regulator
"A" to drop its voltage without violating the requirement, hence its
voltage should be changed in steps so that its couple "B" could follow
(there is also max-spread requirement).

Add new "max_uV_step" constraint that breaks voltage change into several
steps, each step is limited by the max_uV_step value.
