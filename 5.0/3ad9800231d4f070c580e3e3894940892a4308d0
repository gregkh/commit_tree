scsi: target/core: Reduce the amount of code executed with a spinlock held

Due to the "make ABORT and LUN RESET handling synchronous" patch, cmd->work
is only modified from the regular command execution path and no longer
asynchronously by the code that executes task management functions. Since
the regular command execution code is sequential per command, no locking is
required to manipulate cmd->work. Hence stop protecting cmd->work
manipulations with locking.
