y2038: signal: Add sys_rt_sigtimedwait_time32

Once sys_rt_sigtimedwait() gets changed to a 64-bit time_t, we have
to provide compatibility support for existing binaries.

An earlier version of this patch reused the compat_sys_rt_sigtimedwait
entry point to avoid code duplication, but this newer approach
duplicates the existing native entry point instead, which seems
a bit cleaner.
