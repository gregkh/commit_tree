power: supply: ds2780: fix race-condition in bin attribute registration

This is a follow-up patch to the previous one, which fixed a
race-condition during registration of the attribute group.
This fixes the same issue for the binary attributes by adding
them to the properly registered group. As a side effect the
code is further cleaned up.
