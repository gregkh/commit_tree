mlxsw: spectrum: acl: Pass key pointer to master_mask_set/clear

The device requires that the master mask of each region will be
composed from a logical OR between all the unmasked bits in the region.
Currently, this is just a logical OR between all the eRPs used in the
region, but the next patch is going to introduce delta bits support
which need to be taken into account as well.

Since the eRP does not include the delta bits, pass the key pointer to
mlxsw_sp_acl_erp_master_mask_set/clear instead. Convert key->mask to
the bitmap on fly.
