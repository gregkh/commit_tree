KVM: arm64: Add support for creating PUD hugepages at stage 2

KVM only supports PMD hugepages at stage 2. Now that the various page
handling routines are updated, extend the stage 2 fault handling to
map in PUD hugepages.

Addition of PUD hugepage support enables additional page sizes (e.g.,
1G with 4K granule) which can be useful on cores that support mapping
larger block sizes in the TLB entries.
