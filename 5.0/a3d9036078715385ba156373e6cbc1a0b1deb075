ASoC: Intel: atom: Make PCI dependency explicit

After 'commit 5d32a66541c4 ("PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without
CONFIG_PCI set")' dependencies on CONFIG_PCI that previously were
satisfied implicitly through dependencies on CONFIG_ACPI have to be
specified directly. This code relies on IOSF_MBI and IOSF_MBI depends
on PCI. For this reason, add a direct dependency on CONFIG_PCI to the
IOSF_MBI driver.
