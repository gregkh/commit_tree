net/mlx5e: Refactor TIR configuration function

Refactor mlx5e_build_indir_tir_ctx_hash for better code re-use. TIR
stands for Transport Interface Receive, which is responsible for all
transport related operations on the receive side. Added a
static array with TIR default configuration values. This separates
configuration values from command setting, which is needed for
downstream patch.
