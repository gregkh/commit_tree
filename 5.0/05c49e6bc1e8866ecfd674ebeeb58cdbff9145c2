btrfs: dev-replace: go back to suspend state if another EXCL_OP is running

In a secnario where balance and replace co-exists as below,

  - start balance
  - pause balance
  - start replace
  - reboot

and when system restarts, balance resumes first. Then the replace is
attempted to restart but will fail as the EXCL_OP lock is already held
by the balance. If so place the replace state back to
BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_SUSPENDED state.
