drm: Use array_size() when creating lease

Passing an object_count of sufficient size will make
object_count * 4 wrap around to be very small, then a later function
will happily iterate off the end of the object_ids array.  Using
array_size() will saturate at SIZE_MAX, the kmalloc() will fail and
we'll return an -ENOMEM to the norty userspace.
