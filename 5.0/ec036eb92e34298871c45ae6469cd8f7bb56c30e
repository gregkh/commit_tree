qed: Display port_id in the UFP debug messages.

MFW sends UFP notifications mostly during the device init phase and PFs
might not be assigned with a name by this time. Hence capturing port-id in
the debug messages would help in finding which PF the ufp notification was
sent to.

Also, fixed a minor scemantic issue in a debug print.
