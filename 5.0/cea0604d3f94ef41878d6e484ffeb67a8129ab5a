sfc: add missing NVRAM partition types for EF10

Expose the MUM/SUC Firmware, UEFI Expansion ROM and MC Status partitions
 of the NIC's NVRAM as MTDs if found on the NIC.  The first two are needed
 in order to properly update them when performing firmware updates; the MC
 Status partition is used to determine whether a signed firmware image was
 accepted or rejected by a Secure NIC.
