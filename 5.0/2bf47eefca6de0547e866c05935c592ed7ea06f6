media: stkwebcam: Support for ASUS A6VM notebook added.

The ASUS A6VM notebook has a built in stk11xx webcam which is mounted
in a way that the video is vertically and horizontally flipped.
Therefore this notebook is added to the special handling in the driver
to automatically flip the video into the correct orientation.
