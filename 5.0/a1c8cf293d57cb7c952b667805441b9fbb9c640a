perf beauty mmap_flags: Check if the arch has a mmap.h file

If not, then just use what is in asm-generic. This fixes the build for
my sh4, m68k and riscv64 perf test build containers that were failing
due to 80ee5668b8a7 ("perf beauty: Add a generator for MAP_ mmap's flag
constants"), that were not covered in the cset introducing those
tools/arch/*/include/uapi/asm/mman.h files.
