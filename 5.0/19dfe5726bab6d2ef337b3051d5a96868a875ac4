drm/i915: Do intel_panel_destroy_backlight() later

Currently we destroy the backlight during connector unregistration.
That means the final modeset performed by drm_atomic_helper_shutdown()
will leave the backlight on. We don't want that so let's just move
intel_panel_destroy_backlight() into intel_panel_fini() which gets
called during connector destuction.

We still unregister the user visible backlight device during connector
unregistration.
