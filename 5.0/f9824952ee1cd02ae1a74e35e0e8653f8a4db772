block: update sysfs documentation

Add the description of the zoned, nr_zones and chunk_sectors sysfs queue
attributes to Documentation/block/queue-sysfs.txt. The description of
the zoned and chunk_sector attributes are mostly copied from
ABI/testing/sysfs-block (added a typo fix). While at it, also fix a
typo in the description of the io_poll_delay attribute.

nr_zones description is also added to ABI/testing/sysfs-block and
contact email address updated for the zoned attribute.
