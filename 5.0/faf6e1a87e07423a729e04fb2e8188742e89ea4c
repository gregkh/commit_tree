drm/sched: Add boolean to mark if sched is ready to work v5

Problem:
A particular scheduler may become unsuable (underlying HW) after
some event (e.g. GPU reset). If it's later chosen by
the get free sched. policy a command will fail to be
submitted.

Fix:
Add a driver specific callback to report the sched status so
rq with bad sched can be avoided in favor of working one or
none in which case job init will fail.

v2: Switch from driver callback to flag in scheduler.

v3: rebase

v4: Remove ready paramter from drm_sched_init, set
uncoditionally to true once init done.

v5: fix missed change in v3d in v4 (Alex)
