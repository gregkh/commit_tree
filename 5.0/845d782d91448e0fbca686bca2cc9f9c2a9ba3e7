clk: tegra: Fix maximum audio sync clock for Tegra124/210

The maximum frequency supported for I2S on Tegra124 and Tegra210 is
24.576MHz (as stated in the Tegra TK1 data sheet for Tegra124 and the
Jetson TX1 module data sheet for Tegra210). However, the maximum I2S
frequency is limited to 24MHz because that is the maximum frequency of
the audio sync clock. Increase the maximum audio sync clock frequency
to 24.576MHz for Tegra124 and Tegra210 in order to support 24.576MHz
for I2S.

Update the tegra_clk_register_sync_source() function so that it does
not set the initial rate for the sync clocks and use the clock init
tables to set the initial rate instead.
