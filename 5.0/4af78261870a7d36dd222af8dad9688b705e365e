crypto: x86/chacha20 - add XChaCha20 support

Add an XChaCha20 implementation that is hooked up to the x86_64 SIMD
implementations of ChaCha20.  This can be used by Adiantum.

An SSSE3 implementation of single-block HChaCha20 is also added so that
XChaCha20 can use it rather than the generic implementation.  This
required refactoring the ChaCha permutation into its own function.
