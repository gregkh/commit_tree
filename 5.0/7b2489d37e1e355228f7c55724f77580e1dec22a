psi: clarify the Kconfig text for the default-disable option

The current help text caused some confusion in online forums about
whether or not to default-enable or default-disable psi in vendor
kernels.  This is because it doesn't communicate the reason for why we
made this setting configurable in the first place: that the overhead is
non-zero in an artificial scheduler stress test.

Since this isn't representative of real workloads, and the effect was
not measurable in scheduler-heavy real world applications such as the
webservers and memcache installations at Facebook, it's fair to point
out that this is a pretty cautious option to select.
