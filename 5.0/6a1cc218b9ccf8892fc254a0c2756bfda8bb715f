MIPS: branch: Remove FP branch handling when CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n

When CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n we don't support floating point, so remove
the floating point branch support from __compute_return_epc_for_insn() &
__mm_isBranchInstr(). This code should never be needed & more
importantly relies upon FPU state in struct task_struct which will later
be removed.
