bpf: libbpf: retry map creation without the name

Since commit 88cda1c9da02 ("bpf: libbpf: Provide basic API support
to specify BPF obj name"), libbpf unconditionally sets bpf_attr->name
for maps. Pre v4.14 kernels don't know about map names and return an
error about unexpected non-zero data. Retry sys_bpf without a map
name to cover older kernels.

v2 changes:
* check for errno == EINVAL as suggested by Daniel Borkmann
