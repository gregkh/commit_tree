microblaze: fix race condition in building boot images

I fixed a race condition in the parallel building of ARM in commit
3939f3345050 ("ARM: 8418/1: add boot image dependencies to not
generate invalid images").

I see the same problem for MicroBlaze too.

"make -j<N> ARCH=microblaze all linux.bin.ub" results in a broken build
because two threads descend into arch/microblaze/boot simultaneously.

Add proper dependencies to avoid it.
