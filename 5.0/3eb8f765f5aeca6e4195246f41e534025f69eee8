reset: uniphier-usb3: Rename to reset-uniphier-glue

This driver works for controlling the reset lines including USB3
glue layer, however, this can be applied to other glue layers.
Now this patch renames the driver from "reset-uniphier-usb3" to
"reset-uniphier-glue".

At the same time, this changes CONFIG_RESET_UNIPHIER_USB3 to
CONFIG_RESET_UNIPHIER_GLUE.
