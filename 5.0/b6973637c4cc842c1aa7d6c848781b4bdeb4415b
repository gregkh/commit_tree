media: ddbridge: remove another duplicate of io.h and sort includes

The io.h was still included twice. Having a large number of
includes like that unsorted is likely the reason why we ended
by having 3 includes of io.h and two includes of interrupt.h
at the first place.

So, let's reorder the includes on alphabetic order. That would
make easier to maintain it.
