powerpc: split compat syscall table out from native table

PowerPC uses a syscall table with native and compat calls
interleaved, which is a slightly simpler way to define two
matching tables.

As we move to having the tables generated, that advantage
is no longer important, but the interleaved table gets in
the way of using the same scripts as on the other archit-
ectures.

Split out a new compat_sys_call_table symbol that contains
all the compat calls, and leave the main table for the nat-
ive calls, to more closely match the method we use every-
where else.
