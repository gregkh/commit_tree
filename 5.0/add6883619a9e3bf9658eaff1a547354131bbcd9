ASoC: fsl: Fix SND_SOC_EUKREA_TLV320 build error on i.MX8M

eukrea-tlv320.c machine driver runs on non-DT platforms
and include <asm/mach-types.h> header file in order to be able
to use some machine_is_eukrea_xxx() macros.

Building it for ARM64 causes the following build error:

sound/soc/fsl/eukrea-tlv320.c:28:10: fatal error: asm/mach-types.h: No such file or directory

Avoid this error by not allowing to build the SND_SOC_EUKREA_TLV320
driver when ARM64 is selected.

This is needed in preparation for the i.MX8M support.
