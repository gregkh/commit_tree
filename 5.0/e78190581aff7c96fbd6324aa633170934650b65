net: ensure unbound stream socket to be chosen when not in a VRF

The commit a04a480d4392 ("net: Require exact match for TCP socket
lookups if dif is l3mdev") only ensures that the correct socket is
selected for packets in a VRF. However, there is no guarantee that
the unbound socket will be selected for packets when not in a VRF.
By checking for a device match in compute_score() also for the case
when there is no bound device and attaching a score to this, the
unbound socket is selected. And if a failure is returned when there
is no device match, this ensures that bound sockets are never selected,
even if there is no unbound socket.
