bnxt: remove printing of hwrm message

bnxt_en 0000:19:00.0 (unregistered net_device) (uninitialized): hwrm
req_type 0x190 seq id 0x6 error 0xffff

The message above is commonly seen when a newer driver is used on
hardware with older firmware. The issue is this message means nothing to
anyone except Broadcom. Remove the message to not confuse users as this
message is really not very informative.
