intel-ethernet: software timestamp skbs as late as possible

Many of the Intel Ethernet drivers call skb_tx_timestamp() earlier than
necessary. Move the calls to this function to the latest point possible,
just prior to notifying hardware of the new Tx packet when we bump the
tail register.

This affects i40e, iavf, igb, igc, and ixgbe.

The e100, e1000, e1000e, fm10k, and ice drivers already call the
skb_tx_timestamp() function just prior to indicating the Tx packet to
hardware, so they do not need to be changed.
