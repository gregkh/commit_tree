cgroups: Replace synchronize_sched() with synchronize_rcu()

Now that synchronize_rcu() waits for preempt-disable regions of code
as well as RCU read-side critical sections, synchronize_sched() can be
replaced by synchronize_rcu().  This commit therefore makes this change,
even though it is but a comment.
