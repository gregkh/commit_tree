mmc: host: tmio: Use GPIO descriptors

The TMIO MMC driver was passing global GPIO numbers around for
card detect. It turns out only one single board in the kernel
was actually making use of this feature so it is pretty easy
to convert the driver to use only GPIO descriptors.

The lines are flagged as GPIO_ACTIVE_[LOW|HIGH] as that is
what they are, and since we can now rely on the descriptors
to have the right polarity, we set the
"override_active_level" to false in mmc_gpiod_request_cd()
and mmc_gpiod_request_ro().
