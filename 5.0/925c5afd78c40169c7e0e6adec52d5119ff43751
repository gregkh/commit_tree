ARM: dts: sun8i: h3: Fix the system-control register range

Unlike in previous generations, the system-control register range is not
limited to a size of 0x30 on the H3. In particular, the EMAC clock
configuration register (accessed through syscon) is at offset 0x30 in
that range.

Extend the register size to its full range (0x1000) as a result.
