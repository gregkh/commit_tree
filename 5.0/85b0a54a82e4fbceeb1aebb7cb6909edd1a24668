loop: Move loop_reread_partitions() out of loop_ctl_mutex

Calling loop_reread_partitions() under loop_ctl_mutex causes lockdep to
complain about circular lock dependency between bdev->bd_mutex and
lo->lo_ctl_mutex. The problem is that on loop device open or close
lo_open() and lo_release() get called with bdev->bd_mutex held and they
need to acquire loop_ctl_mutex. OTOH when loop_reread_partitions() is
called with loop_ctl_mutex held, it will call blkdev_reread_part() which
acquires bdev->bd_mutex. See syzbot report for details [1].

Move all calls of loop_rescan_partitions() out of loop_ctl_mutex to
avoid lockdep warning and fix deadlock possibility.
