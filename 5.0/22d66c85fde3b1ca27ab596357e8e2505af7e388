serdev: use zero to indicate infinite write timeout

Use zero to indicate infinite timeout for the synchronous
serdev_device_write() helper.

This allows drivers to specify an infinite timeout without knowing about
serdev implementation details, while also allowing the same timeout
argument to be used for both serdev_device_write() and
serdev_device_wait_until_sent().

Note that passing zero to the current helper makes no sense; just call
the asynchronous serdev_device_write_buf() directly instead.
