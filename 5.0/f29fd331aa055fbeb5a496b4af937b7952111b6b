i3c: master: dw-i3c-master: fix i3c_attach/reattach

This patch fix i3c_attach/reattach functions.

During the i3c_attach the driver ignores the static address used for
SETDASA CCC command.

During the i3c_reattach the driver doesn't update master->addrs[data->index]
with new address if old_dyn_addr = 0.
