net: systemport: Fix reception of BPDUs

SYSTEMPORT has its RXCHK parser block that attempts to validate the
packet structures, unfortunately setting the L2 header check bit will
cause Bridge PDUs (BPDUs) to be incorrectly rejected because they look
like LLC/SNAP packets with a non-IPv4 or non-IPv6 Ethernet Type.
