nvme-tcp: add NVMe over TCP host driver

This patch implements the NVMe over TCP host driver. It can be used to
connect to remote NVMe over Fabrics subsystems over good old TCP/IP.

The driver implements the TP 8000 of how nvme over fabrics capsules and
data are encapsulated in nvme-tcp pdus and exchaged on top of a TCP byte
stream. nvme-tcp header and data digest are supported as well.

To connect to all NVMe over Fabrics controllers reachable on a given taget
port over TCP use the following command:

	nvme connect-all -t tcp -a $IPADDR

This requires the latest version of nvme-cli with TCP support.
