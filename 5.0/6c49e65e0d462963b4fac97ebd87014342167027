bpf: Support socket lookup in CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR progs

Make bpf_sk_lookup_tcp, bpf_sk_lookup_udp and bpf_sk_release helpers
available in programs of type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR.

Such programs operate on sockets and have access to socket and struct
sockaddr passed by user to system calls such as sys_bind, sys_connect,
sys_sendmsg.

It's useful to be able to lookup other sockets from these programs.
E.g. sys_connect may lookup IP:port endpoint and if there is a server
socket bound to that endpoint ("server" can be defined by saddr & sport
being zero), redirect client connection to it by rewriting IP:port in
sockaddr passed to sys_connect.
