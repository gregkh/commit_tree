net/smc: fix smc_poll in SMC_INIT state

smc_poll() returns with mask bit EPOLLPRI if the connection urg_state
is SMC_URG_VALID. Since SMC_URG_VALID is zero, smc_poll signals
EPOLLPRI errorneously if called in state SMC_INIT before the connection
is created, for instance in a non-blocking connect scenario.

This patch switches to non-zero values for the urg states.
