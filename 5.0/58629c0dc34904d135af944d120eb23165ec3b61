powerpc/powernv/npu: Fault user page into the hypervisor's pagetable

When a page fault happens in a GPU, the GPU signals the OS and the GPU
driver calls the fault handler which populated a page table; this allows
the GPU to complete an ATS request.

On the bare metal get_user_pages() is enough as it adds a pte to
the kernel page table but under KVM the partition scope tree does not get
updated so ATS will still fail.

This reads a byte from an effective address which causes HV storage
interrupt and KVM updates the partition scope tree.
