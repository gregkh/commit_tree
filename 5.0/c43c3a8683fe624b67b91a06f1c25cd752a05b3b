KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Cleanups - constify memslots, fix comments

This adds 'const' to the declarations for the struct kvm_memory_slot
pointer parameters of some functions, which will make it possible to
call those functions from kvmppc_core_commit_memory_region_hv()
in the next patch.

This also fixes some comments about locking.
