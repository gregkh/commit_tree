btrfs: reada: reorder dev-replace locks before radix tree preload

The device-replace read lock is going to use rw semaphore in followup
commits. The semaphore might sleep which is not possible in the radix
tree preload section. The lock nesting is now:

* device replace
  * radix tree preload
    * readahead spinlock
