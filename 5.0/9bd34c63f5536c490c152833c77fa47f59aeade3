bus: ti-sysc: Fix timer handling with drop pm_runtime_irq_safe()

Commit 84badc5ec5fc ("ARM: dts: omap4: Move l4 child devices to probe
them with ti-sysc") started producing a warning for pwm-omap-dmtimer:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 77 at drivers/bus/omap_l3_noc.c:147
l3_interrupt_handler+0x2f8/0x388
44000000.ocp:L3 Custom Error: MASTER MPU TARGET L4PER2 (Idle):

...
__pm_runtime_idle
omap_dm_timer_disable
pwm_omap_dmtimer_start
pwm_omap_dmtimer_enable
pwm_apply_state
pwm_vibrator_start
pwm_vibrator_play_work

This is because the timer that pwm-omap-dmtimer is using is now being
probed with ti-sysc interconnect target module instead of omap_device
and the ti-sysc quirk for SYSC_QUIRK_LEGACY_IDLE is not fully
compatible with what omap_device has been doing.

We could fix this by reverting the timer changes and have the timer
probe again with omap_device. Or we could add more quirk handling to
ti-sysc driver. But as these options don't work nicely as longer term
solutions, let's just make timers probe with ti-sysc without any
quirks.

To do this, all we need to do is remove quirks for timers for ti-sysc,
and drop the bogus pm_runtime_irq_safe() flag for timer-ti-dm.

We should not use pm_runtime_irq_safe() anyways for drivers as it will
take a permanent use count on the parent device blocking the parent
devices from idling and has been forcing ti-sysc driver to use a
quirk flag.

Note that we will move the timer data to DEBUG section later on in
clean-up patches.
