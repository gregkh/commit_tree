arm64: smp: Rework early feature mismatched detection

Rather than add additional variables to detect specific early feature
mismatches with secondary CPUs, we can instead dedicate the upper bits
of the CPU boot status word to flag specific mismatches.

This allows us to communicate both granule and VA-size mismatches back
to the primary CPU without the need for additional book-keeping.
