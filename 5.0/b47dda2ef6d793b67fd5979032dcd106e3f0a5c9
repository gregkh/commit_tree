btrfs: dev-replace: set result code of cancel by status of scrub

The device-replace needs to check the result code of the scrub workers
in btrfs_dev_replace_cancel and distinguish if successful cancel
operation and when the there was no operation running.

If btrfs_scrub_cancel() fails, return
BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_RESULT_NOT_STARTED so that user can try
to cancel the replace again.
