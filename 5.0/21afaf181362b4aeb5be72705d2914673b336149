x86/mce: Streamline MCE subsystem's naming

Rename the containing folder to "mce" which is the most widespread name.
Drop the "mce[-_]" filename prefix of some compilation units (while
others don't have it).

This unifies the file naming in the MCE subsystem:

mce/
|-- amd.c
|-- apei.c
|-- core.c
|-- dev-mcelog.c
|-- genpool.c
|-- inject.c
|-- intel.c
|-- internal.h
|-- Makefile
|-- p5.c
|-- severity.c
|-- therm_throt.c
|-- threshold.c
`-- winchip.c

No functional changes.
