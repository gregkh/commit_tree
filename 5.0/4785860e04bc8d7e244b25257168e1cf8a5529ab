RDMA/uverbs: Implement an ioctl that can call write and write_ex handlers

Now that the handlers do not process their own udata we can make a
sensible ioctl that wrappers them. The ioctl follows the same format as
the write_ex() and has the user explicitly specify the core and driver
in/out opaque structures and a command number.

This works for all forms of write commands.
