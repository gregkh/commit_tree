wireless: airo: potential buffer overflow in sprintf()

It looks like we wanted to print a maximum of BSSList_rid.ssidLen bytes
of the ssid, but we accidentally use "%*s" (width) instead of "%.*s"
(precision) so if the ssid doesn't have a NUL terminator this could lead
to an overflow.

Static analysis.  Not tested.
