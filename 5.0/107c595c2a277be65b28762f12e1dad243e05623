drm/i915: Skip the ERR_PTR error state

Although commit fb6f0b64e455 ("drm/i915: Prevent machine hang from
Broxton's vtd w/a and error capture") applied cleanly after a 24 month
hiatus, the code had moved on with new methods for peeking and fetching
the captured gpu info. Make sure we catch all uses of the stashed error
state and avoid dereferencing the error pointer.

v2: Move error pointer determination into i915_gpu_capture_state
v3: Restore early check to avoid capturing and then throwing away
subsequent GPU error states.
