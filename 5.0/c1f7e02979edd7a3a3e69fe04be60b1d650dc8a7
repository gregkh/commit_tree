net: cls_flower: Remove filter from mask before freeing it

In fl_change(), when adding a new rule (i.e. fold == NULL), a driver may
reject the new rule, for example due to resource exhaustion. By that
point, the new rule was already assigned a mask, and it was added to
that mask's hash table. The clean-up path that's invoked as a result of
the rejection however neglects to undo the hash table addition, and
proceeds to free the new rule, thus leaving a dangling pointer in the
hash table.

Fix by removing fnew from the mask's hash table before it is freed.
