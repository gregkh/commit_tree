dt-bindings: phy-qcom-qmp: Move #clock-cells to child

The phy-qcom-qmp bindings specified #clock-cells as 1. This was never used
because of_clk_add_provider() was never called, so there was no way anybody
could reference these clocks from DT. Furthermore, even if they could be
accessed, the bindings never specified what should go in that additional
cell.

Fix these incomplete and broken bindings. Move the #clock-cells into the
child node, since that is the actual clock provider, and not all
instances of qcom-qmp-phy are clock providers. Also set #clock-cells to
zero, since there's nothing to pass to it.
