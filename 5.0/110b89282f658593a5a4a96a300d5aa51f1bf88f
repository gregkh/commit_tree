tty/ldsem: Add lockdep asserts for ldisc_sem

Make sure under CONFIG_LOCKDEP that each change to line discipline
is done with held write semaphor.
Otherwise potential reader will have a good time dereferencing
incomplete/uninitialized ldisc.

An exception here is tty_ldisc_open(), as it's called without ldisc_sem
locked by tty_init_dev() => tty_ldisc_setup() for the tty->link.

It seem valid as tty_init_dev() will call tty_driver_install_tty()
which will find ops->install(). Install will establish tty->link in
pty_common_install(), just after allocation of slave tty with
alloc_tty_struct(). So, no one should have a reference to slave pty yet.
