ibmveth: fix DMA unmap error in ibmveth_xmit_start error path

Commit 33a48ab105a7 ("ibmveth: Fix DMA unmap error") fixed an issue in the
normal code path of ibmveth_xmit_start() that was originally introduced by
Commit 6e8ab30ec677 ("ibmveth: Add scatter-gather support"). This original
fix missed the error path where dma_unmap_page is wrongly called on the
header portion in descs[0] which was mapped with dma_map_single. As a
result a failure to DMA map any of the frags results in a dmesg warning
when CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG is enabled.

DMA-API: ibmveth 30000002: device driver frees DMA memory with wrong function
  [device address=0x000000000a430000] [size=172 bytes] [mapped as page] [unmapped as single]
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 8426 at kernel/dma/debug.c:1085 check_unmap+0x4fc/0xe10

sch_direct_xmit+0x224/0x490

This fixes the API misuse by unampping descs[0] with dma_unmap_single.
