mmc: renesas_sdhi: handle 4tap hs400 mode quirk based on SoC revision

Latest datasheet makes it clear that not all ES revisions of the H3 and
M3-W have the 4-tap HS400 mode quirk, currently the quirk is set
unconditionally for these two SoCs. Prepare to handle the quirk based on
SoC revision instead of compatibility value by using soc_device_match()
and set the TMIO_MMC_HAVE_4TAP_HS400 flag explicitly.

The reason for adding a new quirks struct instead of just a flag is that
looking ahead it seems more quirks needs to be handled in a SoC revision
basis.
