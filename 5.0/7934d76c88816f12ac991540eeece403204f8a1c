platform/x86: apple-gmux: Make PCI dependency explicit

After commit 5d32a66541c4 (PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without
CONFIG_PCI set) dependencies on CONFIG_PCI that previously were
satisfied implicitly through dependencies on CONFIG_ACPI have to be
specified directly.

This driver depends on the PCI infrastructure but the dependency has
not been called out explicitly yet.
