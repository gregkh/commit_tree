arm64: Avoid masking "old" for LSE cmpxchg() implementation

The CAS instructions implicitly access only the relevant bits of the "old"
argument, so there is no need for explicit masking via type-casting as
there is in the LL/SC implementation.

Move the casting into the LL/SC code and remove it altogether for the LSE
implementation.
