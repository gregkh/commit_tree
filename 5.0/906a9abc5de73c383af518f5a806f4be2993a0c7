ASoC: Intel: Haswell/Broadwell: fix setting for .dynamic field

For some reason this field was set to zero when all other drivers use
.dynamic = 1 for front-ends. This change was tested on Dell XPS13 and
has no impact with the existing legacy driver. The SOF driver also works
with this change which enables it to override the fixed topology.
