HID: i2c-hid: Disable runtime PM on Goodix touchpad

A Goodix touchpad doesn't work. Touching the touchpad can trigger IRQ
but there's no input event from HID subsystem.

Turns out it reports some invalid data:
[   22.136630] i2c_hid i2c-DELL091F:00: input: 0b 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

After some trial and error, it's another device that doesn't work well
with ON/SLEEP commands. Disable runtime PM to fix the issue.
