spi: rockchip: set min/max speed

The driver previously checked each transfer if the
requested speed was higher than possible with the
current spi clock rate and raised the clock rate
accordingly.

However, there is no check to see if the spi clock
was actually set that high and no way to dynamically
lower the spi clock rate again.

So it seems any potiential users of this functionality
are better off just setting the spi clock rate at init
using the assigned-clock-rates devicetree property.

Removing this dynamic spi clock rate raising allows
us let the spi framework handle min/max speeds
for us.
