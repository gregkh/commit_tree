net: macb: Apply RXUBR workaround only to versions with errata

The interrupt handler contains a workaround for RX hang applicable
to Zynq and AT91RM9200 only. Subsequent versions do not need this
workaround. This workaround unnecessarily resets RX whenever RX used
bit read is observed, which can be often under heavy traffic. There
is no other action performed on RX UBR interrupt. Hence introduce a
CAPS mask; enable this interrupt and workaround only on affected
versions.
