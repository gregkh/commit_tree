drm/syncobj: Mark local add/remove callback functions as static

drivers/gpu/drm/drm_syncobj.c:181:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘drm_syncobj_add_callback’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/drm_syncobj.c:190:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘drm_syncobj_remove_callback’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]

Fixing that leads to

drivers/gpu/drm/drm_syncobj.c:181:13: warning: ‘drm_syncobj_add_callback’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

so remove the unused drm_syncobj_add_callback() entirely.
