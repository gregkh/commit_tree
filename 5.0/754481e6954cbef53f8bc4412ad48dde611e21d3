tracing: Use str_has_prefix() helper for histogram code

The tracing histogram code contains a lot of instances of the construct:

 strncmp(str, "const", sizeof("const") - 1)

This can be prone to bugs due to typos or bad cut and paste. Use the
str_has_prefix() helper macro instead that removes the need for having two
copies of the constant string.
