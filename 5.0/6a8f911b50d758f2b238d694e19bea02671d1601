powerpc/8xx: Use hardware assistance in TLB handlers

Today, on the 8xx the TLB handlers do SW tablewalk by doing all
the calculation in ASM, in order to match with the Linux page
table structure.

The 8xx offers hardware assistance which allows significant size
reduction of the TLB handlers, hence also reduces the time spent
in the handlers.

However, using this HW assistance implies some constraints on the
page table structure:
- Regardless of the main page size used (4k or 16k), the
level 1 table (PGD) contains 1024 entries and each PGD entry covers
a 4Mbytes area which is managed by a level 2 table (PTE) containing
also 1024 entries each describing a 4k page.
- 16k pages require 4 identifical entries in the L2 table
- 512k pages PTE have to be spread every 128 bytes in the L2 table
- 8M pages PTE are at the address pointed by the L1 entry and each
8M page require 2 identical entries in the PGD.

This patch modifies the TLB handlers to use HW assistance for 4K PAGES.

Before that patch, the mean time spent in TLB miss handlers is:
- ITLB miss: 80 ticks
- DTLB miss: 62 ticks
After that patch, the mean time spent in TLB miss handlers is:
- ITLB miss: 72 ticks
- DTLB miss: 54 ticks
So the improvement is 10% for ITLB and 13% for DTLB misses
