l2tp: copy 4 more bytes to linear part if necessary

The size of L2TPv2 header with all optional fields is 14 bytes.
l2tp_udp_recv_core only moves 10 bytes to the linear part of a
skb. This may lead to l2tp_recv_common read data outside of a skb.

This patch make sure that there is at least 14 bytes in the linear
part of a skb to meet the maximum need of l2tp_udp_recv_core and
l2tp_recv_common. The minimum size of both PPP HDLC-like frame and
Ethernet frame is larger than 14 bytes, so we are safe to do so.

Also remove L2TP_HDR_SIZE_NOSEQ, it is unused now.
