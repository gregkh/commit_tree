net: tcp6: prefer listeners bound to an address

A relatively common use case is to have several IPs configured
on a host, and have different listeners for each of them. We would
like to add a "catch all" listener on addr_any, to match incoming
connections not served by any of the listeners bound to a specific
address.

However, port-only lookups can match addr_any sockets when sockets
listening on specific addresses are present if so_reuseport flag
is set. This patch eliminates lookups into port-only hashtable,
as lookups by (addr,port) tuple are easily available.

In addition, compute_score() is tweaked to _not_ match
addr_any sockets to specific addresses, as hash collisions
could result in the unwanted behavior described above.

Tested: the patch compiles; full test in the last patch in this
patchset. Existing reuseport_* selftests also pass.
