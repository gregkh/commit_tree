ARCv2: don't assume core 0x54 has dual issue

The first release of core4 (0x54) was dual issue only (HS4x).
Newer releases allow hardware to be configured as single issue (HS3x)
or dual issue.

Prevent accessing a HS4x only aux register in HS3x, which otherwise
leads to illegal instruction exceptions
