cpuset: Enable cpuset controller in default hierarchy

Given the fact that thread mode had been merged into 4.14, it is now
time to enable cpuset to be used in the default hierarchy (cgroup v2)
as it is clearly threaded.

The cpuset controller had experienced feature creep since its
introduction more than a decade ago. Besides the core cpus and mems
control files to limit cpus and memory nodes, there are a bunch of
additional features that can be controlled from the userspace. Some of
the features are of doubtful usefulness and may not be actively used.

This patch enables cpuset controller in the default hierarchy with
a minimal set of features, namely just the cpus and mems and their
effective_* counterparts.  We can certainly add more features to the
default hierarchy in the future if there is a real user need for them
later on.

Alternatively, with the unified hiearachy, it may make more sense
to move some of those additional cpuset features, if desired, to
memory controller or may be to the cpu controller instead of staying
with cpuset.
