ASoC: audio-graph-scu-card: tidyup "prefix" parsing

audio-graph-scu-card.c is supporting "prefix" which is used to avoid
DAI naming conflict when CPU/Codec matching.
But, sound card might have multi sub-devices, and each codec might need
each prefix.

Now, ASoC is supporting snd_soc_of_parse_node_prefix(), let's support
it on audio-graph-scu-card, too. It is keeping existing DT style.

It can't support each codec's prefix if sound card had multi sub-devices
without this patch.
