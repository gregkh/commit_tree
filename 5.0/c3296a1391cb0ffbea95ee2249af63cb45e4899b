arm64: add <asm/asm-prototypes.h>

While we can export symbols from assembly files, CONFIG_MODVERIONS requires C
declarations of anyhting that's exported.

Let's account for this as other architectures do by placing these declarations
in <asm/asm-prototypes.h>, which kbuild will automatically use to generate
modversion information for assembly files.

Since we already define most prototypes in existing headers, we simply need to
include those headers in <asm/asm-prototypes.h>, and don't need to duplicate
these.
