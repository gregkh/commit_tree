Revert "perf augmented_syscalls: Drop 'write', 'poll' for testing without self pid filter"

Now that we have the "filtered_pids" logic in place, no need to do this
rough filter to avoid the feedback loop from 'perf trace's own syscalls,
revert it.

This reverts commit 7ed71f124284359676b6496ae7db724fee9da753.
