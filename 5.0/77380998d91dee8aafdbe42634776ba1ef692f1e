bpftool: add loadall command

This patch adds new *loadall* command which slightly differs from the
existing *load*. *load* command loads all programs from the obj file,
but pins only the first programs. *loadall* pins all programs from the
obj file under specified directory.

The intended usecase is flow_dissector, where we want to load a bunch
of progs, pin them all and after that construct a jump table.
