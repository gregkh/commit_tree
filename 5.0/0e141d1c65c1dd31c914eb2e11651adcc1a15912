cpufreq: scmi: Fix frequency invariance in slow path

The scmi-cpufreq driver calls the arch_set_freq_scale() callback on
frequency changes to provide scale-invariant load-tracking signals to
the scheduler. However, in the slow path, it does so while specifying
the current and max frequencies in different units, hence resulting in a
broken freq_scale factor.

Fix this by passing all frequencies in KHz, as stored in the CPUFreq
frequency table.
