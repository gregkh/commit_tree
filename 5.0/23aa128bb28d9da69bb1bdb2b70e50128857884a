ASoC: use dma_ops of parent device for acp_audio_dma

AMD platform device acp_audio_dma can only be created by parent PCI
device driver (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acp.c). Pass struct
device of the parent to snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages() so
dma_alloc_coherent() can use correct dma_ops. Otherwise, it will
use default dma_ops which is nommu_dma_ops on x86_64 even when
IOMMU is enabled and set to non passthrough mode.

Though platform device inherits some dma related fields during its
creation in mfd_add_device(), we can't simply pass its struct device
to snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages() because dma_ops is not among the
inherited fields. Even it were, drivers/iommu/amd_iommu.c would
ignore it because get_device_id() doesn't handle platform device.

This change shouldn't give us any trouble even struct device of the
parent becomes null or represents some non PCI device in the future,
because get_dma_ops() correctly handles null struct device or uses
the default dma_ops if struct device doesn't have it set.
