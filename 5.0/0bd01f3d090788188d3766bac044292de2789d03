RDMA/uverbs: Require all objects to have a driver destroy function

If we can't destroy the object then we certainly shouldn't allow it be
created or used. Remove it from the uverbs_uapi in this case.

This also disables methods of other objects that have mandatory object
handle inputs - ie REG_DM_MR is now automatically removed if DM objects
cannot be created.

Typically drivers not supporting an interface will mark all of the
supporting functions as NULL, including destroy.

This is intended to automatically eliminate entire corner cases in the API
that are difficult to test.
