nfp: copy only the relevant part of the TX descriptor for frags

Chained descriptors for fragments need to duplicate all the descriptor
fields of the skb head, so we copy the descriptor and then modify the
relevant fields.  This is wasteful, because the top half of the descriptor
will get overwritten entirely while the bottom half is not modified at all.
Copy only the bottom half.  This saves us 0.3% of CPU in a GSO test.
