drm/i915/guc: fix GuC suspend/resume

The ENTER/EXIT_S_STATE actions queue the save/restore operation in GuC
FW and then return, so waiting on the H2G is not enough to guarantee
GuC is done.
When all the processing is done, GuC writes 0 to scratch register 14,
so we can poll on that. Note that GuC does not ensure that the value
in the register is different from 0 while the action is in progress
so we need to take care of that ourselves as well.

v2: improve comment, return early on GuC error and improve error
