tracing: Fix number of entries in trace header

The following commit

  441dae8f2f29 ("tracing: Add support for display of tgid in trace output")

removed the call to print_event_info() from print_func_help_header_irq()
which results in the ftrace header not reporting the number of entries
written in the buffer. As this wasn't the original intent of the patch,
re-introduce the call to print_event_info() to restore the orginal
behaviour.
