wil6210: fix reset flow for Talyn-mb

With current reset flow, Talyn sometimes get stuck causing PCIe
enumeration to fail. Fix this by removing some reset flow operations
that are not relevant for Talyn.
Setting bit 15 in RGF_HP_CTRL is WBE specific and is not in use for
all wil6210 devices.
For Sparrow, BIT_HPAL_PERST_FROM_PAD and BIT_CAR_PERST_RST were set
as a WA an HW issue.
