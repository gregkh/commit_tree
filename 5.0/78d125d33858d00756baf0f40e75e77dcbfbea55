sched/membarrier: Replace synchronize_sched() with synchronize_rcu()

Now that synchronize_rcu() waits for preempt-disable regions of code
as well as RCU read-side critical sections, the synchronize_sched()
in sys_membarrier() can be replaced by synchronize_rcu().  This commit
therefore makes this change.
