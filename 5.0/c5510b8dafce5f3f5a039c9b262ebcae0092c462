gpiolib: Fix return value of gpio_to_desc() stub if !GPIOLIB

If CONFIG_GPOILIB is not set, the stub of gpio_to_desc() should return
the same type of error as regular version: NULL.  All the callers
compare the return value of gpio_to_desc() against NULL, so returned
ERR_PTR would be treated as non-error case leading to dereferencing of
error value.
