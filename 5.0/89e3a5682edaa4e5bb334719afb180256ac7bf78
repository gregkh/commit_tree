ALSA: hda/realtek - Headset microphone support for System76 darp5

On the System76 Darter Pro (darp5), there is a headset microphone
input attached to 0x1a that does not have a jack detect.  In order to
get it working, the pin configuration needs to be set correctly, and
the ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE_NO_HP_MIC fixup needs to be applied.
This is similar to the MIC_NO_PRESENCE fixups for some Dell laptops,
except we have a separate microphone jack that is already configured
correctly.
