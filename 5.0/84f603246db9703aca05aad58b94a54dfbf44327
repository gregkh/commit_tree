block: add rq_qos_wait to rq_qos

Originally when I split out the common code from blk-wbt into rq_qos I
left the wbt_wait() where it was and simply copied and modified it
slightly to work for io-latency.  However they are both basically the
same thing, and as time has gone on wbt_wait() has ended up much smarter
and kinder than it was when I copied it into io-latency, which means
io-latency has lost out on these improvements.

Since they are the same thing essentially except for a few minor things,
create rq_qos_wait() that replicates what wbt_wait() currently does with
callbacks that can be passed in for the snowflakes to do their own thing
as appropriate.
