drm/i915/icl: Skip init for an already enabled combo PHY

Bspec says we should skip the initialization of combo PHYs that are
already initialized. We'll need to reinit the PHYs more frequently
when exiting from DC6 (after the next patch), so let's make sure the
uninit sequence complies with the spec. For safety skip the init only if
all the PHY register fields have their expected values.

v2:
- Print 'Port X' as we do elsewhere instead of 'Port-X'. (Jose)
