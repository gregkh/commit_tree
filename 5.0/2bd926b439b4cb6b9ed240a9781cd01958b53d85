kasan: add CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC and CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS

This commit splits the current CONFIG_KASAN config option into two:
1. CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC, that enables the generic KASAN mode (the one
   that exists now);
2. CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS, that enables the software tag-based KASAN mode.

The name CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS is chosen as in the future we will have
another hardware tag-based KASAN mode, that will rely on hardware memory
tagging support in arm64.

With CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS enabled, compiler options are changed to
instrument kernel files with -fsantize=kernel-hwaddress (except the ones
for which KASAN_SANITIZE := n is set).

Both CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC and CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS support both
CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE and CONFIG_KASAN_OUTLINE instrumentation modes.

This commit also adds empty placeholder (for now) implementation of
tag-based KASAN specific hooks inserted by the compiler and adjusts
common hooks implementation.

While this commit adds the CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS config option, this option
is not selectable, as it depends on HAVE_ARCH_KASAN_SW_TAGS, which we will
enable once all the infrastracture code has been added.
