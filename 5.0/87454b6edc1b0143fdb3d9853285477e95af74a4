net: phylink: avoid resolving link state too early

During testing on Armada 388 platforms, it was found with a certain
module configuration that it was possible to trigger a kernel oops
during the module load process, caused by the phylink resolver being
triggered for a currently disabled interface.

This problem was introduced by changing the way the SFP registration
works, which now can result in the sfp link down notification being
called during phylink_create().
