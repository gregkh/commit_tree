fou6: Prevent unbounded recursion in GUE error handler

I forgot to deal with IPv6 in commit 11789039da53 ("fou: Prevent unbounded
recursion in GUE error handler").

Now syzbot reported what might be the same type of issue, caused by
gue6_err(), that is, handling exceptions for direct UDP encapsulation in
GUE (UDP-in-UDP) leads to unbounded recursion in the GUE exception
handler.

As it probably doesn't make sense to set up GUE this way, and it's
currently not even possible to configure this, skip exception handling for
UDP (or UDP-Lite) packets encapsulated in UDP (or UDP-Lite) packets with
GUE on IPv6.
