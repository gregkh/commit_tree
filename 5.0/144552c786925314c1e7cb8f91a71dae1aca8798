of: overlay: add tests to validate kfrees from overlay removal

Add checks:
  - attempted kfree due to refcount reaching zero before overlay
    is removed
  - properties linked to an overlay node when the node is removed
  - node refcount > one during node removal in a changeset destroy,
    if the node was created by the changeset

After applying this patch, several validation warnings will be
reported from the devicetree unittest during boot due to
pre-existing devicetree bugs. The warnings will be similar to:

  OF: ERROR: of_node_release(), unexpected properties in /testcase-data/overlay-node/test-bus/test-unittest11
  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2, of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry: attach overlay node /testcase-data-2/substation@100/
