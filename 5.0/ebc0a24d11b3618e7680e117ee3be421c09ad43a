dt-bindings: sram: sunxi: Add bindings for the H5 with SRAM C1

This introduces new bindings for the H5 SoC in the SRAM controller.
Because the SRAM layout is different from other SoCs, no backward
compatibility is assumed with any of them.

However, the C1 SRAM section alone looks similar to previous SoCs,
so it is compatible with the initial A10 binding.
