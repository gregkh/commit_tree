leds: gpio: Drop unneeded manual of_node assignment

This reverts the main change of commit bff23714bc36 ("leds: leds-gpio:
Set of_node for created LED devices") because of_node assignment is
handled by core since commit 7ea79ae86c28 ("leds: gpio: use OF variant
of LED registering function").  Basically the code was overwriting the
of_node with same value.

No functional change expected.
