audit: Replace chunk attached to mark instead of replacing mark

Audit tree code currently associates new fsnotify mark with each new
chunk. As chunk attached to an inode is replaced when new tag is added /
removed, we also need to remove old fsnotify mark and add a new one on
such occasion.  This is cumbersome and makes locking rules somewhat
difficult to follow.

Fix these problems by allocating fsnotify mark independently of chunk
and keeping it all the time while there is some chunk attached to an
inode. Also add documentation about the locking rules so that things are
easier to follow.
