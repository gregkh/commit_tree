mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Add Bloom filter handling

Spectrum-2 HW uses Bloom filter in order to skip lookups on specific
eRPs. It uses crc-16-Msbit-first calculation over a specific layout
of a rule's key fields combined with eRP ID as well as region ID.
Per potential lookup, iff the Bloom filter entry of the calculated
index is empty, then the lookup can be skipped. Hence, the mlxsw
driver should update the Bloom filter entry per each rule insertion
or deletion when rules are part of an eRP.

Add functions for adding and deleting entries in the Bloom filter.
In order to do so also add crc-16 computation based on the specific
Spectrum-2 polynomial and a function for encoding the crc-16 input
in the manner dictated by HW implementation.
