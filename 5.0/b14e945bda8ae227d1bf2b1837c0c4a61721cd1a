drm/sun4i: tcon: Prepare and enable TCON channel 0 clock at init

When initializing clocks, a reference to the TCON channel 0 clock is
obtained. However, the clock is never prepared and enabled later.
Switching from simplefb to DRM actually disables the clock (that was
usually configured by U-Boot) because of that.

On the V3s, this results in a hang when writing to some mixer registers
when switching over to DRM from simplefb.

Fix this by preparing and enabling the clock when initializing other
clocks. Waiting for sun4i_tcon_channel_enable to enable the clock is
apparently too late and results in the same mixer register access hang.
