xfs: reallocate realtime summary cache on growfs

At mount time, we allocate m_rsum_cache with the number of realtime
bitmap blocks. However, xfs_growfs_rt() can increase the number of
realtime bitmap blocks. Using the cache after this happens may access
out of the bounds of the cache. Fix it by reallocating the cache in this
case.
