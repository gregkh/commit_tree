libata: Add NOLPM quirk for SAMSUNG MZ7TE512HMHP-000L1 SSD

We've received a bugreport that using LPM with a SAMSUNG
MZ7TE512HMHP-000L1 SSD leads to system instability, we already have
a quirk for the MZ7TD256HAFV-000L9, which is also a Samsun EVO 840 /
PM851 OEM model, so it seems some of these models have a LPM issue.

This commits adds a NOLPM quirk for the model string from the new
bugeport, to avoid the reported stability issues.
