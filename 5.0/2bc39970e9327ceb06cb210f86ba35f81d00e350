x86/kvm/hyper-v: Introduce KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID

With every new Hyper-V Enlightenment we implement we're forced to add a
KVM_CAP_HYPERV_* capability. While this approach works it is fairly
inconvenient: the majority of the enlightenments we do have corresponding
CPUID feature bit(s) and userspace has to know this anyways to be able to
expose the feature to the guest.

Add KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID ioctl (backed by KVM_CAP_HYPERV_CPUID, "one
cap to rule them all!") returning all Hyper-V CPUID feature leaves.

Using the existing KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID doesn't seem to be possible:
Hyper-V CPUID feature leaves intersect with KVM's (e.g. 0x40000000,
0x40000001) and we would probably confuse userspace in case we decide to
return these twice.

KVM_CAP_HYPERV_CPUID's number is interim: we're intended to drop
KVM_CAP_HYPERV_STIMER_DIRECT and use its number instead.
