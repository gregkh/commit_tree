mmc: sdhci-msm: Re-initialize DLL if MCLK is gated dynamically

On few SDHCI-MSM controllers, the host controller's clock tuning
circuit may go out of sync if controller clocks are gated which
eventually will result in data CRC, command CRC/timeout errors.
To overcome this h/w limitation, the DLL needs to be re-initialized
and restored with its old settings once clocks are ungated.
