clk: ti: Fix error handling in ti_clk_parse_divider_data()

The ti_clk_parse_divider_data() function is only called from
_get_div_table_from_setup().  That function doesn't look at the return
value but instead looks at the "*table" pointer.  In this case, if the
kcalloc() fails then *table is NULL (which means success).  It should
instead be an error pointer.

The ti_clk_parse_divider_data() function has two callers.  One checks
for errors and the other doesn't.  I have fixed it so now both handle
errors.
