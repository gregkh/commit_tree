net: ipv4: use a dedicated counter for icmp_v4 redirect packets

According to the algorithm described in the comment block at the
beginning of ip_rt_send_redirect, the host should try to send
'ip_rt_redirect_number' ICMP redirect packets with an exponential
backoff and then stop sending them at all assuming that the destination
ignores redirects.
If the device has previously sent some ICMP error packets that are
rate-limited (e.g TTL expired) and continues to receive traffic,
the redirect packets will never be transmitted. This happens since
peer->rate_tokens will be typically greater than 'ip_rt_redirect_number'
and so it will never be reset even if the redirect silence timeout
(ip_rt_redirect_silence) has elapsed without receiving any packet
requiring redirects.

Fix it by using a dedicated counter for the number of ICMP redirect
packets that has been sent by the host

I have not been able to identify a given commit that introduced the
issue since ip_rt_send_redirect implements the same rate-limiting
algorithm from commit 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")
