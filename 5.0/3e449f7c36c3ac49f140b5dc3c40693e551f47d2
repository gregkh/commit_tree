tools lib traceevent: Fix diverse typos in comments

Go over the tools/ files that are maintained in Arnaldo's tree and
fix common typos: half of them were in comments, the other half
in JSON files.

No change in functionality intended.

Committer notes:

This was split from a larger patch as there are code that is,
additionally, maintained outside the kernel tree, so to ease cherry
picking and/or backporting, split this into multiple patches.
