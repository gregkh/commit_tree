drm/i915/gtt: Revert "Disable read-only support under GVT"

This reverts commit c9e666880de5a1fed04dc412b046916d542b72dd.

Checked GVT codes that guest PPGTT PTE flag bits are propagated
to shadow PTE. Read/write bit is not changed. Further tested by
i915 self-test case "igt_ctx_readonly". No error or GPU hang was
detected. So enable read-only support under GVT.
