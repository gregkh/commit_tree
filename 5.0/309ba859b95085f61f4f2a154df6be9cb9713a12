rcu: Eliminate synchronize_rcu_mult()

Now that synchronize_rcu() waits for both RCU read-side critical
sections and preempt-disabled regions of code, the sole caller of
synchronize_rcu_mult() can be replaced by synchronize_rcu().
This patch makes this change and removes synchronize_rcu_mult().
Note that _wait_rcu_gp() still supports synchronize_rcu_mult(),
and thus might be simplified in the future to take only take
a single call_rcu() function rather than the current list of them.
