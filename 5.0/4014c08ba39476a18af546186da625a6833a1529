bus: ti-sysc: Check for no-reset and no-idle flags at the child level

With ti-sysc, we need to now have the device tree properties for
ti,no-reset-on-init and ti,no-idle-on-init at the module level instead
of the child device level.

Let's check for these properties at the child device level to enable
quirks, and warn about moving the properties to the module level.

Otherwise am335x-evm based boards tagging gpio1 with ti,no-reset-on-init
will have their DDR power disabled if wired up in such a tricky way.

Note that this should not be an issue for earlier kernels as we don't
rely on this until the dts files have been updated to probe with ti-sysc
interconnect target driver.
