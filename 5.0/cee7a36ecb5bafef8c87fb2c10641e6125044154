crypto: x86/chacha20 - Add a 8-block AVX-512VL variant

This variant is similar to the AVX2 version, but benefits from the AVX-512
rotate instructions and the additional registers, so it can operate without
any data on the stack. It uses ymm registers only to avoid the massive core
throttling on Skylake-X platforms. Nontheless does it bring a ~30% speed
improvement compared to the AVX2 variant for random encryption lengths.

The AVX2 version uses "rep movsb" for partial block XORing via the stack.
With AVX-512, the new "vmovdqu8" can do this much more efficiently. The
associated "kmov" instructions to work with dynamic masks is not part of
the AVX-512VL instruction set, hence we depend on AVX-512BW as well. Given
that the major AVX-512VL architectures provide AVX-512BW and this extension
does not affect core clocking, this seems to be no problem at least for
now.
