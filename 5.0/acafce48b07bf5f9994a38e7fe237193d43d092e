firmware: arm_sdei: Fix DT platform device creation

It turns out the dt-probing part of this wasn't tested properly after it
was merged. commit 3aa0582fdb82 ("of: platform: populate /firmware/ node
from of_platform_default_populate_init()") changed the core-code to
generate the platform devices, meaning the driver's attempt fails, and it
bails out.

Fix this by removing the manual platform-device creation for DT systems,
core code has always done this for us.
