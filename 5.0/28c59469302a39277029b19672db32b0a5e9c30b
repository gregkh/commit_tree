Revert "drm/amd/display: Set RMX_ASPECT as default"

This reverts commit 91b66c47ba3468f7882ea4a84d5e0e0c186b638f.

Forcing RMX_ASPECT as default uses the preferred/native mode's timings
for any mode the user selects and scales the image. This provides a
a consistently nicer result in the case where the selected mode's
refresh rate matches the native mode's refresh but this isn't always
the case.

For example, if the monitor is 1080p@144Hz and the preferred mode is
60Hz then even if the user selects 1080p@144Hz as their selected mode
they'll get 1080p@60Hz.
