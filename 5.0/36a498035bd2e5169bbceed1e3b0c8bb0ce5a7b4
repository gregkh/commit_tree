MIPS: Avoid FCSR sanitization when CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n

When CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n we don't support floating point, so we
don't need to worry about floating point exceptions pending in the
Floating point Control & Status Register (FCSR) during switch_to(). Stub
out the __sanitize_fcr31() macro in this case.
