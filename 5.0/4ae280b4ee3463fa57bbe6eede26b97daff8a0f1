dm thin: fix bug where bio that overwrites thin block ignores FUA

When provisioning a new data block for a virtual block, either because
the block was previously unallocated or because we are breaking sharing,
if the whole block of data is being overwritten the bio that triggered
the provisioning is issued immediately, skipping copying or zeroing of
the data block.

When this bio completes the new mapping is inserted in to the pool's
metadata by process_prepared_mapping(), where the bio completion is
signaled to the upper layers.

This completion is signaled without first committing the metadata.  If
the bio in question has the REQ_FUA flag set and the system crashes
right after its completion and before the next metadata commit, then the
write is lost despite the REQ_FUA flag requiring that I/O completion for
this request must only be signaled after the data has been committed to
non-volatile storage.

Fix this by deferring the completion of overwrite bios, with the REQ_FUA
flag set, until after the metadata has been committed.
