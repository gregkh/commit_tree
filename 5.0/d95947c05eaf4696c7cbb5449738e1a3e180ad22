media: dib7000p: Remove dead code

Clang warns that 'interleaving' is assigned to itself in this function.

drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib7000p.c:1874:15: warning: explicitly
assigning value of variable of type 'int' to itself [-Wself-assign]
        interleaving = interleaving;
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just remove the self-assign and leave existing code in place for now.
