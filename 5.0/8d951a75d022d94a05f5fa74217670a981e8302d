net/ncsi: Configure multi-package, multi-channel modes with failover

This patch extends the ncsi-netlink interface with two new commands and
three new attributes to configure multiple packages and/or channels at
once, and configure specific failover modes.

NCSI_CMD_SET_PACKAGE mask and NCSI_CMD_SET_CHANNEL_MASK set a whitelist
of packages or channels allowed to be configured with the
NCSI_ATTR_PACKAGE_MASK and NCSI_ATTR_CHANNEL_MASK attributes
respectively. If one of these whitelists is set only packages or
channels matching the whitelist are considered for the channel queue in
ncsi_choose_active_channel().

These commands may also use the NCSI_ATTR_MULTI_FLAG to signal that
multiple packages or channels may be configured simultaneously. NCSI
hardware arbitration (HWA) must be available in order to enable
multi-package mode. Multi-channel mode is always available.

If the NCSI_ATTR_CHANNEL_ID attribute is present in the
NCSI_CMD_SET_CHANNEL_MASK command the it sets the preferred channel as
with the NCSI_CMD_SET_INTERFACE command. The combination of preferred
channel and channel whitelist defines a primary channel and the allowed
failover channels.
If the NCSI_ATTR_MULTI_FLAG attribute is also present then the preferred
channel is configured for Tx/Rx and the other channels are enabled only
for Rx.
