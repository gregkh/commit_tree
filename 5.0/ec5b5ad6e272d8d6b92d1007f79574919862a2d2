intel_th: msu: Fix an off-by-one in attribute store

The 'nr_pages' attribute of the 'msc' subdevices parses a comma-separated
list of window sizes, passed from userspace. However, there is a bug in
the string parsing logic wherein it doesn't exclude the comma character
from the range of characters as it consumes them. This leads to an
out-of-bounds access given a sufficiently long list. For example:

> # echo 8,8,8,8 > /sys/bus/intel_th/devices/0-msc0/nr_pages
> ==================================================================
> BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in memchr+0x1e/0x40

Fix this by accounting for the comma character.
