net: convert bridge_nf to use skb extension infrastructure

This converts the bridge netfilter (calling iptables hooks from bridge)
facility to use the extension infrastructure.

The bridge_nf specific hooks in skb clone and free paths are removed, they
have been replaced by the skb_ext hooks that do the same as the bridge nf
allocations hooks did.
