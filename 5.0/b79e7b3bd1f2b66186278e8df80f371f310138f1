ARM: dts: dra7: Move the ti,no-idle quirk on proper gmac node

Hwmod parses the DT hierarchically from root to search for matching
ti,hwmod property. With the introduction of L4 data, we have two nodes
with the ti,hwmod = "gmac" declaration, and the hwmod core only matches
the first one found, which is the target-module one. This node incorrectly
dropped the ti,no-idle flag, which causes number of problems, like ignoring
errata i877, and also causing an intermittent boot failure on certain dra7
boards.

Fix the issue by moving the ti,no-idle flag to the proper node.
