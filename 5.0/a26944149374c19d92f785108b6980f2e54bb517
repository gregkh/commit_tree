rtc: class: reimplement devm_rtc_device_register

Implement devm_rtc_device_register using devm_rtc_allocate_device and
__rtc_register_device so there is only one path left to register rtc
devices.

Also mark it as deprecated so new drivers will hopefully use
devm_rtc_allocate_device and rtc_register_device that are less race prone
and allow avoiding the 2038, 2070, 2100 and 2106 bugs properly.
