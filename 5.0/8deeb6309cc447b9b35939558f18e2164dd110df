net: phy: don't set state PHY_CHANGELINK in phy_change

State PHY_CHANGELINK isn't needed here, we can call the state machine
directly. We just have to remove the check for phy_polling_mode() to
make this work also in interrupt mode. Removing this check doesn't
cause any overhead because when not polling the state machine is
called only if required by some event.
