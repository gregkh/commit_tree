btrfs: Remove extent_io_ops::writepage_end_io_hook

This callback is ony ever called for data page writeout so there is no
need to actually abstract it via extent_io_ops. Lets just export it,
remove the definition of the callback and call it directly in the
functions that invoke the callback. Also rename the function to
btrfs_writepage_endio_finish_ordered since what it really does is
account finished io in the ordered extent data structures.  No
functional changes.
