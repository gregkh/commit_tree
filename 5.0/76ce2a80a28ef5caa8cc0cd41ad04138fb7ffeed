Rename include/{uapi => }/asm-generic/shmparam.h really

Commit 36c0f7f0f899 ("arch: unexport asm/shmparam.h for all
architectures") is different from the patch I submitted.

My patch is this:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1546904307-11124-1-git-send-email-yamada.masahiro@socionext.com/T/#u

The file renaming part:

  rename include/{uapi => }/asm-generic/shmparam.h (100%)

was lost when it was picked up.

I think it was an accident because Andrew did not say anything.
