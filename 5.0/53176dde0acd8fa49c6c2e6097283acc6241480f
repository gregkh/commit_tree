btrfs: dev-replace: remove custom read/write blocking scheme

After the rw semaphore has been added, the custom blocking using
::blocking_readers and ::read_lock_wq is redundant.

The blocking logic in __btrfs_map_block is replaced by extending the
time the semaphore is held, that has the same blocking effect on writes
as the previous custom scheme that waited until ::blocking_readers was
zero.
