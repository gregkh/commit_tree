mailbox: tegra-hsp: use devm_kstrdup_const()

Use devm_kstrdup_const() in the tegra-hsp driver. This mostly serves as
an example of how to use this new routine to shrink driver code.

Also use devm_kzalloc() instead of regular kzalloc() to shrink the
driver even more.

Doorbell objects are only removed in the driver's remove callback so
it's safe to convert all memory allocations to devres.
