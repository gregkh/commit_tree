NFS/NFSD/SUNRPC: replace generic creds with 'struct cred'.

SUNRPC has two sorts of credentials, both of which appear as
"struct rpc_cred".
There are "generic credentials" which are supplied by clients
such as NFS and passed in 'struct rpc_message' to indicate
which user should be used to authorize the request, and there
are low-level credentials such as AUTH_NULL, AUTH_UNIX, AUTH_GSS
which describe the credential to be sent over the wires.

This patch replaces all the generic credentials by 'struct cred'
pointers - the credential structure used throughout Linux.

For machine credentials, there is a special 'struct cred *' pointer
which is statically allocated and recognized where needed as
having a special meaning.  A look-up of a low-level cred will
map this to a machine credential.
