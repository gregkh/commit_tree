md/raid1: don't clear bitmap bits on interrupted recovery.

sync_request_write no longer submits writes to a Faulty device. This has
the unfortunate side effect that bitmap bits can be incorrectly cleared
if a recovery is interrupted (previously, end_sync_write would have
prevented this). This means the next recovery may not copy everything
it should, potentially corrupting data.

Add a function for doing the proper md_bitmap_end_sync, called from
end_sync_write and the Faulty case in sync_request_write.

backport note to 4.14: s/md_bitmap_end_sync/bitmap_end_sync
