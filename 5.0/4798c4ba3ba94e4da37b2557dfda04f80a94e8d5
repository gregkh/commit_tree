tools/bpf: extends test_btf to test load/retrieve func_type info

A two function bpf program is loaded with btf and func_info.
After successful prog load, the bpf_get_info syscall is called
to retrieve prog info to ensure the types returned from the
kernel matches the types passed to the kernel from the
user space.

Several negative tests are also added to test loading/retriving
of func_type info.
