ALSA: fireface: add support for packet streaming on Fireface 800

This commit adds a functionality to multiplex PCM frames into isochronous
packets and demultiplex PCM frames from isochronous packets for ALSA PCM
applications.

Fireface 800 voluntarily maintains resources for tx isochronous
communication.  It performs reservation of isochronous channel and
allocation/update of bandwidth in some cases below:
 - at a first request to allocation after bus resets
 - at requests to allocation when further bandwidth is required

When request is grant and the unit is prepared, read data from
0x0000801c0008 represents isochronous channel for tx stream, then
the unit can handle requests to start communication. If driver
send the request without checking the register, the unit takes
panic to continue bus resets. The unit starts transmission of
tx packets after receiving several rx packets from driver.

I note that the unit can process tx/rx packets and generate/record
sound regardless of HOST LED.
