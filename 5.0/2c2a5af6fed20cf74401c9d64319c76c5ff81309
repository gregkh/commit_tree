mm, memory_hotplug: add nid parameter to arch_remove_memory

Patch series "Do not touch pages in hot-remove path", v2.

This patchset aims for two things:

 1) A better definition about offline and hot-remove stage
 2) Solving bugs where we can access non-initialized pages
    during hot-remove operations [2] [3].

This is achieved by moving all page/zone handling to the offline
stage, so we do not need to access pages when hot-removing memory.

This patch (of 5):

This is a preparation for the following-up patches.  The idea of passing
the nid is that it will allow us to get rid of the zone parameter
afterwards.
