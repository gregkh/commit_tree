can: gw: ensure DLC boundaries after CAN frame modification

Muyu Yu provided a POC where user root with CAP_NET_ADMIN can create a CAN
frame modification rule that makes the data length code a higher value than
the available CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum
calculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data
(e.g. cgw_csum_xor_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag_list pointer in
skb_shared_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system crash.

Michael Kubecek suggested to drop frames that have a DLC exceeding the
available space after the modification process and provided a patch that can
handle CAN FD frames too. Within this patch we also limit the length for the
checksum calculations to the maximum of Classic CAN data length (8).

CAN frames that are dropped by these additional checks are counted with the
CGW_DELETED counter which indicates misconfigurations in can-gw rules.

This fixes CVE-2019-3701.
