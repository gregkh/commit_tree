tty/ldsem: Decrement wait_readers on timeouted down_read()

It seems like when ldsem_down_read() fails with timeout, it misses
update for sem->wait_readers. By that reason, when writer finally
releases write end of the semaphore __ldsem_wake_readers() does adjust
sem->count with wrong value:
sem->wait_readers * (LDSEM_ACTIVE_BIAS - LDSEM_WAIT_BIAS)

I.e, if update comes with 1 missed wait_readers decrement, sem->count
will be 0x100000001 which means that there is active reader and it'll
make any further writer to fail in acquiring the semaphore.

It looks like, this is a dead-code, because ldsem_down_read() is never
called with timeout different than MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT, so it might be
worth to delete timeout parameter and error path fall-back..
