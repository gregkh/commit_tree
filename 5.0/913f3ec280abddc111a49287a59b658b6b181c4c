media: mem2mem: Require capture and output mutexes to match

Currently, all the mem2mem driver either use a single mutex
to lock the capture and output videobuf2 queues, or don't
set any mutex.

This means the mutexes match, and so the mem2mem framework
is able to set the m2m context lock.

Enforce this by making it mandatory for drivers to set
the same capture and output mutex, or not set any mutex at all.
