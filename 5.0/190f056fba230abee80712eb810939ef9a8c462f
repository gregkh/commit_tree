s390/vdso: correct vdso mapping for compat tasks

While "s390/vdso: avoid 64-bit vdso mapping for compat tasks" fixed
64-bit vdso mapping for compat tasks under gdb it introduced another
problem. "compat_mm" flag is not inherited during fork and when
31-bit process forks a child (but does not perform exec) it ends up
with 64-bit vdso. To address that, init_new_context (which is called
during fork and exec) now initialize compat_mm based on thread TIF_31BIT
flag. Later compat_mm is adjusted in arch_setup_additional_pages, which
is called during exec.
