xfrm: Make set-mark default behavior backward compatible

Fixes 9b42c1f179a6, which changed the default route lookup behavior for
tunnel mode SAs in the outbound direction to use the skb mark, whereas
previously mark=0 was used if the output mark was unspecified. In
mark-based routing schemes such as Androidâ€™s, this change in default
behavior causes routing loops or lookup failures.

This patch restores the default behavior of using a 0 mark while still
incorporating the skb mark if the SET_MARK (and SET_MARK_MASK) is
specified.

Tested with additions to Android's kernel unit test suite:
