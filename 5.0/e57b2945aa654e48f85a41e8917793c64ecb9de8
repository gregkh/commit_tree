scsi: smartpqi: call pqi_free_interrupts() in pqi_shutdown()

We must free all irqs during shutdown, else kexec's 2nd kernel would hang
in pqi_wait_for_completion_io() as below:

This happens only in the following combinations:

1. smartpqi is built as module, not built-in;
2. We have a disk connected to smartpqi card;
3. Both kexec's 1st and 2nd kernels use this disk as Rootfs' mount point.
