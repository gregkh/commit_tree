drm/i915/execlists: Flush the CS events before unpinning

Inside the execlists submission tasklet, we often make the mistake of
assuming that everything beneath the request is available for use.
However, the submission and the request live on two separate timelines,
and the request contents may be freed from an early retirement before we
have had a chance to run the submission tasklet (think ksoftirqd). To
safeguard ourselves against any mistakes, flush the tasklet before we
unpin the context if execlists still has a reference to this context.

v2: Pull hw_context->active tracking into schedule_in and schedule_out.
