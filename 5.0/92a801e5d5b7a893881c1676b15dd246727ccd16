sched/fair: Mask UTIL_AVG_UNCHANGED usages

The _task_util_est() is mainly used to add/remove the task contribution
to/from the rq's estimated utilization at task enqueue/dequeue time.
In both cases we ensure the UTIL_AVG_UNCHANGED flag is set to keep
consistency between enqueue and dequeue time while still being
transparent to update_load_avg calls which will eventually reset the
flag.

Let's move the flag forcing within _task_util_est() itself so that we
can simplify calling code by hiding that estimated utilization
implementation detail into one of its internal functions.

This will affect also the "public" API task_util_est() but we know that
the flag will (eventually) impact just on the LSB of the estimated
utilization, thus it's certainly acceptable.
