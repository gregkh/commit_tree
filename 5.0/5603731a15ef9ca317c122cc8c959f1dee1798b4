mmc: tmio: fix access width of Block Count Register

In R-Car Gen2 or later, the maximum number of transfer blocks are
changed from 0xFFFF to 0xFFFFFFFF. Therefore, Block Count Register
should use iowrite32().

If another system (U-boot, Hypervisor OS, etc) uses bit[31:16], this
value will not be cleared. So, SD/MMC card initialization fails.

So, check for the bigger register and use apropriate write. Also, mark
the register as extended on Gen2.
