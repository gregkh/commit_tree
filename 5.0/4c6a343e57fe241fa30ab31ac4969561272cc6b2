OPP: Rename and relocate of_genpd_opp_to_performance_state()

The OPP core already has the performance state values for each of the
genpd's OPPs and there is no need to call the genpd callback again to
get the performance state for the case where the end device doesn't have
an OPP table and has the "required-opps" property directly in its node.

This commit renames of_genpd_opp_to_performance_state() as
of_get_required_opp_performance_state() and moves it to the OPP core, as
it is all about OPP stuff now.
