ALSA: firewire-lib: fix wrong handling payload_length as payload_quadlet

In IEC 61883-1/6 engine of ALSA firewire stack, a packet handler has a
second argument for 'the number of bytes in payload of isochronous
packet'. However, an incoming packet handler without CIP header uses the
value as 'the number of quadlets in the payload'. This brings userspace
applications to receive the number of PCM frames as four times against
real time.

This commit fixes the bug.
