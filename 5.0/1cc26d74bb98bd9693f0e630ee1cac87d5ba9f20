net/mlx5e: Support header rewrite actions with remote port mirroring

A rule with the following actions is split to a two level FDB:
1. Forward to local mirror vport
2. Header rewrite
3. Forward to local vport
In the first level flow table, forward the packet to the local port and
forward the packet to the second level flow table for header rewrite and
local port forwarding. This configuration fails when mirroring to a
remote encapsulated destination because currently an FTE cannot support
encap and table destinations.

Use the extended destination capabilities to configure the first level
flow table with a multi-destination FTE to the uplink and second level
table and the second level flow table for the header rewrite and local
port forwarding.
