scsi: lpfc: Fix odd recovery in duplicate FLOGIs in point-to-point

Testing a point-to-point topology and a case of re-FLOGI without
intervening link bouncing, showed an odd interaction with firmware and
a resulting scenario where the driver no longer probed after accepting
the new FLOGI.

Work around the firmware issue by issuing a link bounce if a FLOGI is
received after the link is already up and FLOGI's accepted.

While debugging the issue, realized that some debug traces should be
clarified to help in the future.
