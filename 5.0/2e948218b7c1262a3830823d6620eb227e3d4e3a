serial: sh-sci: Fix crash in rx_timer_fn() on PIO fallback

When falling back to PIO, active_rx must be set to a different value
than cookie_rx[i], else sci_dma_rx_find_active() will incorrectly find a
match, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in rx_timer_fn() later.

Use zero instead, which is the same value as after driver
initialization.
