phonet: fix building with clang

clang warns about overflowing the data[] member in the struct pnpipehdr:

net/phonet/pep.c:295:8: warning: array index 4 is past the end of the array (which contains 1 element) [-Warray-bounds]
                        if (hdr->data[4] == PEP_IND_READY)
                            ^         ~
include/net/phonet/pep.h:66:3: note: array 'data' declared here
                u8              data[1];

Using a flexible array member at the end of the struct avoids the
warning, but since we cannot have a flexible array member inside
of the union, each index now has to be moved back by one, which
makes it a little uglier.
