btrfs: dev-replace: go back to suspended state if target device is missing

At the time of forced unmount we place the running replace to
BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_SUSPENDED state, so when the system comes
back and expect the target device is missing.

Then let the replace state continue to be in
BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_SUSPENDED state instead of
BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_STARTED as there isn't any matching scrub
running as part of replace.
