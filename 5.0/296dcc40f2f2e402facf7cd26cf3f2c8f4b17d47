block/swim3: Fix -EBUSY error when re-opening device after unmount

When the block device is opened with FMODE_EXCL, ref_count is set to -1.
This value doesn't get reset when the device is closed which means the
device cannot be opened again. Fix this by checking for refcount <= 0
in the release method.
