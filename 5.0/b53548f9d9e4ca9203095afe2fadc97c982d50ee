spi: pxa2xx: Remove LPSS private register restoring during resume

Intel LPSS private register restoring in spi-pxa2xx.c: pxa2xx_spi_resume()
was added before there was no any other code restoring them. This was
changed after following commits for previous and current LPSS platforms:

c78b0830667a ("ACPI / LPSS: custom power domain for LPSS")
41a3da2b8e16 ("mfd: intel-lpss: Save register context on suspend")

However there is one caveat: There is no LPSS private register context
save/restore for the Intel Lynxpoint in the Linux kernel code.

I did some debugging on one Lynxpoint based device I have and on it the
LPSS register context is not lost over suspend/resume cycle (s2idle).
Which happens for instance on Intel Braswell. I'm speculating but I guess
either firmware does it or the LPSS is kept always on Lynxpoint.

Given that we haven't needed to implement Lynxpoint LPSS I2C or UART
private register context save/restore over four years time I think we are
safe to remove this LPSS private register restoring during resume here.
