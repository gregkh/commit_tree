perf trace: Rename set_ev_qualifier_filter to clarify its a tracepoint filter

Rename it to trace__set_ev_qualifier_tp_filter(), as this just sets up
tracepoint filters on the raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit} tracepoints, and
since we're going to do the same for the augmented_raw_syscalls
codepath, when used, rename it to clarify.
