ASoC: core: Make snd_soc_find_component() more robust

There are some use cases where you're checking for a lot of things on a
card and it makes sense that you might end up trying to call
snd_soc_find_component() without either a name or an of_node.  Currently
in that case we try to dereference the name and crash but it's more
useful to allow the caller to just treat that as a case where we don't
find anything, that error handling will already exist.

Inspired by a patch from Ajit Pandey fixing some callers.
