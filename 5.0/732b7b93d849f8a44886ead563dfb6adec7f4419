arm64: kexec_file: add kernel signature verification support

With this patch, kernel verification can be done without IMA security
subsystem enabled. Turn on CONFIG_KEXEC_VERIFY_SIG instead.

On x86, a signature is embedded into a PE file (Microsoft's format) header
of binary. Since arm64's "Image" can also be seen as a PE file as far as
CONFIG_EFI is enabled, we adopt this format for kernel signing.

You can create a signed kernel image with:
    $ sbsign --key ${KEY} --cert ${CERT} Image
