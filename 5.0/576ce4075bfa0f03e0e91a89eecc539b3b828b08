ASoC: wm97xx: fix uninitialized regmap pointer problem

gcc notices that without either the ac97 bus or the pdata, we never
initialize the regmap pointer, which leads to an uninitialized variable
access:

sound/soc/codecs/wm9712.c: In function 'wm9712_soc_probe':
sound/soc/codecs/wm9712.c:666:2: error: 'regmap' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Since that configuration is invalid, it's better to return an error
here. I tried to avoid adding complexity to the conditions, and turned
the #ifdef into a regular if(IS_ENABLED()) check for readability.
This in turn requires moving some header file declarations out of
an #ifdef.

The same code is used in three drivers, all of which I'm changing
the same way.
