ARM: dts: rockchip: add qos nodes found on rk3066 and rk3188

QoS nodes keep information about priorites etc on the interconnect
and loose state when the power-domain gets disabled. Therefore the
power-domain driver stores the settings of available qos nodes and
restores them when the power-domain gets enabled again.

So add the qos nodes found on the Cortex-A9 socs from Rockchip, so
that they can then be connected to the power-domains.
