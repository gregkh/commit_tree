regulator: core: Don't double-disable supplies in regulator_disable_deferred()

In the commit f8702f9e4aa7 ("regulator: core: Use ww_mutex for
regulators locking") disabling of the supply was moved into
_regulator_disable().  That means regulator_disable_work() shouldn't
be disabling since that double-disables the supply.
