misc: pvpanic: fix warning implicit declaration

When building and have fragment CONFIG_NO_IOPORT_MAP enabled then the
following warning:

../drivers/misc/pvpanic.c: In function ‘pvpanic_walk_resources’:
../drivers/misc/pvpanic.c:73:10: error: implicit declaration of
 function ‘ioport_map’; did you mean ‘ioremap’?
 [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
   base = ioport_map(r.start, resource_size(&r));
          ^~~~~~~~~~

Since commmit 5d32a66541c4 ("PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without
CONFIG_PCI set"), its now possible to have ACPI enabled without haveing
PCI enabled. However, the pvpanic driver depends on HAS_IOPORT_MAP or
HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT when ACPI is enabled. It was fine until
commit 725eba2928ad ("misc/pvpanic: add MMIO support") got added.
Rework so that we do a extra check ifdef CONFIG_HAS_IOPORT_MAP.
