arm64: kexec_file: load initrd and device-tree

load_other_segments() is expected to allocate and place all the necessary
memory segments other than kernel, including initrd and device-tree
blob (and elf core header for crash).
While most of the code was borrowed from kexec-tools' counterpart,
users may not be allowed to specify dtb explicitly, instead, the dtb
presented by the original boot loader is reused.

arch_kimage_kernel_post_load_cleanup() is responsible for freeing arm64-
specific data allocated in load_other_segments().
