tracing: Replace synchronize_sched() and call_rcu_sched()

Now that synchronize_rcu() waits for preempt-disable regions of code
as well as RCU read-side critical sections, synchronize_sched() can
be replaced by synchronize_rcu().  Similarly, call_rcu_sched() can be
replaced by call_rcu().  This commit therefore makes these changes.
