spi: imx: mx51-ecspi: Move some initialisation to prepare_message hook.

The relevant difference between prepare_message and config is that the
former is run before the CS signal is asserted. So the polarity of the
CLK line must be configured in prepare_message as an edge generated by
config might already result in a latch of the MOSI line.
