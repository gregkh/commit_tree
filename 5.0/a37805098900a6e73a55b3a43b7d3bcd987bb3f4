drm/bufs: Fix Spectre v1 vulnerability

idx can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to a
potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

drivers/gpu/drm/drm_bufs.c:1420 drm_legacy_freebufs() warn: potential
spectre issue 'dma->buflist' [r] (local cap)

Fix this by sanitizing idx before using it to index dma->buflist

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
