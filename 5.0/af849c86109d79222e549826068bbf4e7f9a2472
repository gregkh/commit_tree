mmc: sdhci: Handle auto-command errors

If the host controller supports auto-commands then enable the auto-command
error interrupt and handle it. In the case of auto-CMD23, the error is
treated the same as manual CMD23 error. In the case of auto-CMD12,
commands-during-transfer are not permitted, so the error handling is
treated the same as a data error.
