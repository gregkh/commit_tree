CIFS: Fix error mapping for SMB2_LOCK command which caused OFD lock problem

While resolving a bug with locks on samba shares found a strange behavior.
When a file locked by one node and we trying to lock it from another node
it fail with errno 5 (EIO) but in that case errno must be set to
(EACCES | EAGAIN).
This isn't happening when we try to lock file second time on same node.
In this case it returns EACCES as expected.
Also this issue not reproduces when we use SMB1 protocol (vers=1.0 in
mount options).

Further investigation showed that the mapping from status_to_posix_error
is different for SMB1 and SMB2+ implementations.
For SMB1 mapping is [NT_STATUS_LOCK_NOT_GRANTED to ERRlock]
(See fs/cifs/netmisc.c line 66)
but for SMB2+ mapping is [STATUS_LOCK_NOT_GRANTED to -EIO]
(see fs/cifs/smb2maperror.c line 383)

Quick changes in SMB2+ mapping from EIO to EACCES has fixed issue.
