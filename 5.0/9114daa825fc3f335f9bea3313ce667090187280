batman-adv: Force mac header to start of data on xmit

The caller of ndo_start_xmit may not already have called
skb_reset_mac_header. The returned value of skb_mac_header/eth_hdr
therefore can be in the wrong position and even outside the current skbuff.
This for example happens when the user binds to the device using a
PF_PACKET-SOCK_RAW with enabled qdisc-bypass:

  int opt = 4;
  setsockopt(sock, SOL_PACKET, PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS, &opt, sizeof(opt));

Since eth_hdr is used all over the codebase, the batadv_interface_tx
function must always take care of resetting it.
