sparc: Convert to using %pOFn instead of device_node.name

In preparation to remove the node name pointer from struct device_node,
convert printf users to use the %pOFn format specifier.

This was originally applied for 4.19, but reverted. The problematic
changes to prom_{32,64}.c have been dropped.
