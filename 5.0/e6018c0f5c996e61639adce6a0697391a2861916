sched/wake_q: Document wake_q_add()

The only guarantee provided by wake_q_add() is that a wakeup will
happen after it, it does _NOT_ guarantee the wakeup will be delayed
until the matching wake_up_q().

If wake_q_add() fails the cmpxchg() a concurrent wakeup is pending and
that can happen at any time after the cmpxchg(). This means we should
not rely on the wakeup happening at wake_q_up(), but should be ready
for wake_q_add() to issue the wakeup.

The delay; if provided (most likely); should only result in more efficient
behaviour.
