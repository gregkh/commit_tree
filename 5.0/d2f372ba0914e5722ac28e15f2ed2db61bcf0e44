mlxsw: pci: Increase PCI SW reset timeout

Spectrum-2 PHY layer introduces a calibration period which is a part of the
Spectrum-2 firmware boot process. Hence increase the SW timeout waiting for
the firmware to come out of boot. This does not increase system boot time
in cases where the firmware PHY calibration process is done quickly.
