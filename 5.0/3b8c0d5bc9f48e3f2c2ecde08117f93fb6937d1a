drm/i915/icl: push pll to port mapping/unmapping to ddi encoder hooks

Unclutter the haswell_crtc_enable() and haswell_crtc_disable() functions
a bit by moving the pll to port mapping and unmapping functions to the
ddi encoder hooks. This allows removal of a bunch of boilerplate code
from the functions.

Additionally, the ICL DSI encoder needs to do the clock gating and
ungating slightly differently, and this allows its own handling in a
clean fashion.
