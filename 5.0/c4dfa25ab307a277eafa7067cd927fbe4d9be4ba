mtd: add support for reading MTD devices via the nvmem API

Allow drivers that use the nvmem API to read data stored on MTD devices.
For this the mtd devices are registered as read-only NVMEM providers.

We don't support device tree systems for now.

[Bartosz:
  - include linux/nvmem-provider.h
  - set the name of the nvmem provider
  - set no_of_node to true in nvmem_config
  - don't check the return value of nvmem_unregister() - it cannot fail
  - tweaked the commit message]
