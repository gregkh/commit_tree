i40e: don't restart nway if autoneg not supported

On link types that do not support autoneg, we cannot attempt to restart
nway negotiation. This results in a dead link that requires a power
cycle to remedy.

Fix this by saving off the autoneg state and checking this value before
we try to restart nway.
