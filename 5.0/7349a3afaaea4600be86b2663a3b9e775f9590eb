drm/amd: update ATIF functions in AMD ACPI header

The ACPI interface in AMD was a few years out of date
and contained some unused and deprecated functions

Remove functions: Select Active Displays, Get Lid State,
Get TV Standard, Set TV Standard, Get Panel Expansion Mode,
Set Panel Expansion Mode, Get Graphics Device Types

Add functions: Query Backlight Transfer Characteristics,
Ready To Undock Notification

Changed functions: Get System Parameters,
Get System BIOS Requests

All changes are right from the standard
ATI ACPI Control Methods V0.44
