virtchnl: Fix off by one error

When calculating the valid length for a VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_CHANNELS
message, we accidentally allowed messages with one extra
virtchnl_channel_info structure on the end. This happened due
to an off by one error, because we forgot that valid_len already
accounted for one virtchnl_channel_info structure, so we need to
subtract one from the num_tc value.
