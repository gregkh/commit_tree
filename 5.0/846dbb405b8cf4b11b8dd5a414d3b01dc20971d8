clk: renesas: r8a77995: Remove non-existent SSP clocks

The R-Car Gen3 HardWare Manual Errata for Rev. 0.80 (Dec 22, 2017, and
Feb 28, 2018) removed the SSPSRC, SSP1, and SSP2 clocks on R-Car D3, as
this SoC does not have a Stream and Security Processor.

As these definitions were never used, they can just be removed.
The freed slots in the DT bindings header must not be reused, though.
