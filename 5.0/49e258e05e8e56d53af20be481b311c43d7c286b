arm64: ftrace: remove return_regs macros

The save_return_regs and restore_return_regs macros are only used by
return_to_handler, and having them defined out-of-line only serves to
obscure the logic.

Before we complicate, let's clean this up and fold the logic directly
into return_to_handler, saving a few lines of macro boilerplate in the
process. At the same time, a missing trailing space is added to the
comments, fixing a code style violation.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
