ext4: add ext4_sb_bread() to disambiguate ENOMEM cases

Today, when sb_bread() returns NULL, this can either be because of an
I/O error or because the system failed to allocate the buffer.  Since
it's an old interface, changing would require changing many call
sites.

So instead we create our own ext4_sb_bread(), which also allows us to
set the REQ_META flag.

Also fixed a problem in the xattr code where a NULL return in a
function could also mean that the xattr was not found, which could
lead to the wrong error getting returned to userspace.
