perf/x86/intel/pt: Introduce intel_pt_validate_cap()

intel_pt_validate_hw_cap() validates whether a given PT capability is
supported by the hardware. It checks the PT capability array which
reflects the capabilities of the hardware on which the code is executed.

For setting up PT for KVM guests this is not correct as the capability
array for the guest can be different from the host array.

Provide a new function to check against a given capability array.
