clk: socfpga: stratix10: fix naming convention for the fixed-clocks

The fixed clocks in the DTS file have a hyphen, but the clock driver has
the fixed clocks using underbar. Thus the clock driver cannot detect the
other fixed clocks correctly. Change the fixed clock names to a hyphen.

Stratix10 platform")
