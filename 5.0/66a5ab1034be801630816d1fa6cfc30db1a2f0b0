drm/i915: Fix possible race in intel_dp_add_mst_connector()

This hasn't caused any issues yet that I'm aware of, but as Ville
Syrj채l채 pointed out - we need to make sure that
intel_connector->mst_port is set before initializing MST connectors,
since in theory we could potentially check intel_connector->mst_port in
i915_hpd_poll_init_work() after registering the connector but before
having written it's value.
