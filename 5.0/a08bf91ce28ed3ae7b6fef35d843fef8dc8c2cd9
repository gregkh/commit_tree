KEYS: allow reaching the keys quotas exactly

If the sysctl 'kernel.keys.maxkeys' is set to some number n, then
actually users can only add up to 'n - 1' keys.  Likewise for
'kernel.keys.maxbytes' and the root_* versions of these sysctls.  But
these sysctls are apparently supposed to be *maximums*, as per their
names and all documentation I could find -- the keyrings(7) man page,
Documentation/security/keys/core.rst, and all the mentions of EDQUOT
meaning that the key quota was *exceeded* (as opposed to reached).

Thus, fix the code to allow reaching the quotas exactly.
