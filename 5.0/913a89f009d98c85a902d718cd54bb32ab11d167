ipmi: Don't initialize anything in the core until something uses it

The IPMI driver was recently modified to use SRCU, but it turns out
this uses a chunk of percpu memory, even if IPMI is never used.

So modify thing to on initialize on the first use.  There was already
code to sort of handle this for handling init races, so piggy back
on top of that, and simplify it in the process.
