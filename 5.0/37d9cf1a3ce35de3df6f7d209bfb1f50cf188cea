sched: Fix detection of empty queues in child qdiscs

Several qdiscs check on enqueue whether the packet was enqueued to a class
with an empty queue, in which case the class is activated. This is done by
checking if the qlen is exactly 1 after enqueue. However, if GSO splitting
is enabled in the child qdisc, a single packet can result in a qlen longer
than 1. This means the activation check fails, leading to a stalled queue.

Fix this by checking if the queue is empty *before* enqueue, and running
the activation logic if this was the case.
