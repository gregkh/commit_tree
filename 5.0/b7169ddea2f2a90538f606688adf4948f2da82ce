ASoC: rsnd: remove RSND_REG_ from rsnd_reg

Current rsnd is using RSND_REG_xxx for register naming,
and using RSND_REG_##f style macro for read/write.
The biggest reason why it uses this style is that
we can avoid non-existing register access.
But, its demerit is sequential register access code will
be very ugly.
Current rsnd driver is well tested, so, let's remove RSND_REG_
from rsnd_reg, and cleanup sequential register access code.
