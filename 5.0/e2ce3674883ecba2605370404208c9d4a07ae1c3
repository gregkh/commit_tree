xsk: simplify AF_XDP socket teardown

Prior this commit, when the struct socket object was being released,
the UMEM did not have its reference count decreased. Instead, this was
done in the struct sock sk_destruct function.

There is no reason to keep the UMEM reference around when the socket
is being orphaned, so in this patch the xdp_put_mem is called in the
xsk_release function. This results in that the xsk_destruct function
can be removed!

Note that, it still holds that a struct xsk_sock reference might still
linger in the XSKMAP after the UMEM is released, e.g. if a user does
not clear the XSKMAP prior to closing the process. This sock will be
in a "released" zombie like state, until the XSKMAP is removed.
