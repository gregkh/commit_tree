staging:iio:ad2s90: Add max frequency check at probe

This patch adds a max frequency check at the beginning of ad2s90_probe
function so that when it is set to a value above 0.83Mhz, dev_err is
called with an appropriate message and -EINVAL is returned.

The defined limit is 0.83Mhz instead of 2Mhz, which is the chip's max
frequency as specified in the datasheet, because, as also specified in
the datasheet, a 600ns delay is expected between the application of a
logic LO to CS and the application of SCLK. Since the delay is not
implemented in the spi code, to satisfy it, SCLK's period should be at
most 2 * 600ns, so the max frequency should be 1 / (2 * 6e-7), which
gives roughly 830000Hz.
