net: phy: improve struct phy_device member interrupts handling

As a heritage from the very early days of phylib member interrupts is
defined as u32 even though it's just a flag whether interrupts are
enabled. So we can change it to a bitfield member. In addition change
the code dealing with this member in a way that it's clear we're
dealing with a bool value.
