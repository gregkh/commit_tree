ip_tunnel: Make none-tunnel-dst tunnel port work with lwtunnel

ip l add dev tun type gretap key 1000
ip a a dev tun 10.0.0.1/24

Packets with tun-id 1000 can be recived by tun dev. But packet can't
be sent through dev tun for non-tunnel-dst

With this patch: tunnel-dst can be get through lwtunnel like beflow:
ip r a 10.0.0.7 encap ip dst 172.168.0.11 dev tun
