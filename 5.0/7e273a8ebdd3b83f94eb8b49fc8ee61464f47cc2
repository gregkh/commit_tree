dpaa2-eth: Add basic XDP support

We keep one XDP program reference per channel. The only actions
supported for now are XDP_DROP and XDP_PASS.

Until now we didn't enforce a maximum size for Rx frames based
on MTU value. Change that, since for XDP mode we must ensure no
scatter-gather frames can be received.
