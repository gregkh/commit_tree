kvm: x86: remove unnecessary recalculate_apic_map

In the previous code, the variable apic_sw_disabled influences
recalculate_apic_map. But in "KVM: x86: simplify kvm_apic_map"
(commit: 3b5a5ffa928a3f875b0d5dd284eeb7c322e1688a),
the access to apic_sw_disabled in recalculate_apic_map has been
deleted.
