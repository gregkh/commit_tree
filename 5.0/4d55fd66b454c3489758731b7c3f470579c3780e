drm/virtio: fence: pass plain pointer

Since commit "9fdd90c0f4 drm/virtio: add virtio_gpu_alloc_fence()"
fences are not allocated any more by virtio_gpu_fence_emit().  So there
is no need to pass down a reference to the fence pointer, a plain
pointer is enough now.

Convert virtio_gpu_fence_emit() and callers.
