kasan: add bug reporting routines for tag-based mode

This commit adds rountines, that print tag-based KASAN error reports.
Those are quite similar to generic KASAN, the difference is:

1. The way tag-based KASAN finds the first bad shadow cell (with a
   mismatching tag). Tag-based KASAN compares memory tags from the shadow
   memory to the pointer tag.

2. Tag-based KASAN reports all bugs with the "KASAN: invalid-access"
   header.

Also simplify generic KASAN find_first_bad_addr.
