wil6210: increase RX rings and RX buff array size

In Talyn-MB, the 11ad throughput is higher and performance drops
may occur in the current RX configuration due to unavailability
of Rx buffers.
Increase the RX descriptor ring, RX status ring and number of RX
buffers to stabilize the performance in high throughput.
