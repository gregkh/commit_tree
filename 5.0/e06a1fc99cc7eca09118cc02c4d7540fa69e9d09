btrfs: Remove extent_io_ops::set_bit_hook extent_io callback

This callback is used to properly account delalloc extents for data
inodes (ordinary file inodes and freespace v1 inodes). Those can be
easily identified since they have their extent_io trees ->private_data
member point to the inode. Let's exploit this fact to remove the
needless indirection through extent_io_hooks and directly call the
function. Also give the function a name which reflects its purpose -
btrfs_set_delalloc_extent.

This patch also modified test_find_delalloc so that the extent_io_tree
used for testing doesn't have its ->private_data set which would have
caused a crash in btrfs_set_delalloc_extent due to the btrfs_inode->root
member not being initialised. The old version of the code also didn't
call set_bit_hook since the extent_io ops weren't set for the inode.  No
functional changes.
