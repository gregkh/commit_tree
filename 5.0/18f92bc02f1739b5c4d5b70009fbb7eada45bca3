mmc: meson-gx: make sure the descriptor is stopped on errors

On errors, if we don't stop the descriptor chain, it may continue to
run and raise IRQ after we have called mmc_request_done(). This is bad
because we won't be able to get cmd anymore and properly deal with the
IRQ.

This patch makes sure the descriptor chain is stopped before
calling mmc_request_done()
