genirq/affinity: Pass first vector to __irq_build_affinity_masks()

No functional change.

Prepares for support of allocating and affinitizing sets of interrupts, in
which each set of interrupts needs a full two stage spreading. The first
vector argument is necessary for this so the affinitizing starts from the
first vector of each set.
