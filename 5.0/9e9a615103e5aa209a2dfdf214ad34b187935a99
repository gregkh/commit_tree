zynq-fpga: Only route PR via PCAP when required

The Xilinx Zynq FPGA driver takes ownership of the PR interface, making
it impossible to use the ICAP interface for partial reconfiguration.

This patch changes the driver to only activate PR over PCAP while the
device is actively being accessed by the driver for programming.

This allows both PCAP and ICAP interfaces to be used for PR.
