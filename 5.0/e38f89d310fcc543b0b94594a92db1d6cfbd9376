PM / Domains: Add genpd_opp_to_performance_state()

The OPP core currently stores the performance state in the consumer
device's OPP table, but that is going to change going forward and
performance state will rather be set directly in the genpd's OPP table.

For that we need to get the performance state for genpd's device
structure (genpd->dev) instead of the consumer device's structure. Add a
new helper to do that.
