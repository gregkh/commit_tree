MIPS: VDSO: Use same -m%-float cflag as the kernel proper

The MIPS VDSO build currently doesn't provide the -msoft-float flag to
the compiler as the kernel proper does. This results in an attempt to
use the compiler's default floating point configuration, which can be
problematic in cases where this is incompatible with the target CPU's
-march= flag. For example decstation_defconfig fails to build using
toolchains in which gcc was configured --with-fp-32=xx with the
following error:

    LDS     arch/mips/vdso/vdso.lds
  cc1: error: '-march=r3000' requires '-mfp32'
  make[2]: *** [scripts/Makefile.build:379: arch/mips/vdso/vdso.lds] Error 1

The kernel proper avoids this error because we build with the
-msoft-float compiler flag, rather than using the compiler's default.
Pass this flag through to the VDSO build so that it too becomes agnostic
to the toolchain's floating point configuration.

Note that this is filtered out from KBUILD_CFLAGS rather than simply
always using -msoft-float such that if we switch the kernel to use
-mno-float in the future the VDSO will automatically inherit the change.

The VDSO doesn't actually include any floating point code, and its
.MIPS.abiflags section is already manually generated to specify that
it's compatible with any floating point ABI. As such this change should
have no effect on the resulting VDSO, apart from fixing the build
failure for affected toolchains.
