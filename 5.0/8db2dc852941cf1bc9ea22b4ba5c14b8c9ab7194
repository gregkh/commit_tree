drm: Extend framebuffer_check to handle formats with cpp/char_per_block 0

For formats that are supported only with non-linear modifiers it
doesn't make to much sense to define cpp or char_per_block, so that
will be set to 0.

This patch adds a restriction to force having a modifier attached when
cpp/char_per_block is 0, and to bypass checking the pitch restriction.

This had been discussed here.
