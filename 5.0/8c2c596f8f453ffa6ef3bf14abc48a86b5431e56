arm64: entry: remove unused register aliases

In commit:

  3b7142752e4bee15 ("arm64: convert native/compat syscall entry to C")

... we moved the syscall invocation code from assembly to C, but left
behind a number of register aliases which are now unused.

Let's remove them before they confuse someone.
