ARM: dts: meson8: add the Cortex-A9 global timer

The Meson8 and Meson8m2 SoCs are using four Cortex-A9 cores. These come
with an ARM global timer.
This adds the Cortex-A9 global timer but keeps it disabled for now. The
timer is clocked by the "PERIPH" clock whose rate can change during
runtime (when changing the frequency of the CPU clock). Unfortunately
the arm_global_timer driver does not handle changes to the clock rate
yet.
