drm/amd/display: Retiring set_display_requirements in dm_pp_smu.h - part1

[Why]
In DCN we want direct DAL to SMU calls, with as little as possible
interference by pplib. The reason for each pp_smu interface mapping
to 1 SMU message is so we can have the sequencing of different SMU
message in dal and shared across different OS. This will also simplify
debugging as DAL owns this interaction and there's no confusion about
division of ownership.

[How]
Part 1: Separate set_min_deep_Sleep_dcfclk message from the SMU
messages that are sent as part of dcn10_pplib_apply_display_requirements.
Notify deep sleep dcfclk to smu directly
