xfrm: policy: increment xfrm_hash_generation on hash rebuild

Hash rebuild will re-set all the inexact entries, then re-insert them.
Lookups that can occur in parallel will therefore not find any policies.

This was safe when lookups were still guarded by rwlock.
After rcu-ification, lookups check the hash_generation seqcount to detect
when a hash resize takes place.  Hash rebuild missed the needed increment.

Hash resizes and hash rebuilds cannot occur in parallel (both acquire
hash_resize_mutex), so just increment xfrm_hash_generation, like resize.
