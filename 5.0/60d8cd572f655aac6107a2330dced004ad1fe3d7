arm64/xen: fix xen-swiotlb cache flushing

Xen-swiotlb hooks into the arm/arm64 arch code through a copy of the DMA
DMA mapping operations stored in the struct device arch data.

Switching arm64 to use the direct calls for the merged DMA direct /
swiotlb code broke this scheme.  Replace the indirect calls with
direct-calls in xen-swiotlb as well to fix this problem.
