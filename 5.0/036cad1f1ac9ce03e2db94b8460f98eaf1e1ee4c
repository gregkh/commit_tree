scsi: lpfc: fcoe: Fix link down issue after 1000+ link bounces

On FCoE adapters, when running link bounce test in a loop, initiator
failed to login with switch switch and required driver reload to
recover. Switch reached a point where all subsequent FLOGIs would be
LS_RJT'd. Further testing showed the condition to be related to not
performing FCF discovery between FLOGI's.

Fix by monitoring FLOGI failures and once a repeated error is seen
repeat FCF discovery.
