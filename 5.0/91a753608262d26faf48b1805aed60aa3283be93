platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Add Yoga 2 13 to no_hw_rfkill list

Some Lenovo IdeaPad models lack a physical rfkill switch.
On Lenovo models Yoga 2 13, ideapad-laptop would wrongly report all
radios as blocked by hardware which caused wireless network connections
to fail.

Add these models without an rfkill switch to the no_hw_rfkill list.
