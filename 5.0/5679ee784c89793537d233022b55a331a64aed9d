tipc: handle broadcast NAME_DISTRIBUTOR packet when receiving it

NAME_DISTRIBUTOR messages are transmitted through unicast link on TIPC
2.0, by contrast, the messages are delivered through broadcast link on
TIPC 1.7. But at present, NAME_DISTRIBUTOR messages received by
broadcast link cannot be handled in tipc_rcv() until an unicast message
arrives, which may lead to a significant delay to update name table.

To avoid this delay, we will also deal with broadcast NAME_DISTRIBUTOR
message on broadcast receive path.
