kernel/sys.c: Clarify that UNAME26 does not generate unique versions anymore

UNAME26 is a mechanism to report Linux's version as 2.6.x, for
compatibility with old/broken software.  Due to the way it is
implemented, it would have to be updated after 5.0, to keep the
resulting versions unique.  Linus Torvalds argued:

 "Do we actually need this?

  I'd rather let it bitrot, and just let it return random versions. It
  will just start again at 2.4.60, won't it?

  Anybody who uses UNAME26 for a 5.x kernel might as well think it's
  still 4.x. The user space is so old that it can't possibly care about
  differences between 4.x and 5.x, can it?

  The only thing that matters is that it shows "2.4.<largeenough>",
  which it will do regardless"
