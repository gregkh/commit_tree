lightnvm: pblk: fix resubmission of overwritten write err lbas

Make sure we only look up valid lba addresses on the resubmission path.

If an lba is invalidated in the write buffer, that sector will be
submitted to disk (as it is already mapped to a ppa), and that write
might fail, resulting in a crash when trying to look up the lba in the
mapping table (as the lba is marked as invalid).
