mac80211: fix radiotap vendor presence bitmap handling

Due to the alignment handling, it actually matters where in the code
we add the 4 bytes for the presence bitmap to the length; the first
field is the timestamp with 8 byte alignment so we need to add the
space for the extra vendor namespace presence bitmap *before* we do
any alignment for the fields.

Move the presence bitmap length accounting to the right place to fix
the alignment for the data properly.
