btrfs: add members to fs_devices to track fsid changes

In order to gracefully handle split-brain scenario during fsid change
(which are very unlikely, yet possible), two more pieces of information
will be necessary:

1. The highest generation number among all devices registered to a
   particular btrfs_fs_devices

2. A boolean flag whether a given btrfs_fs_devices was created by a
   device which had the FSID_CHANGING_V2 flag set.

This is a preparatory patch and just introduces the variables as well
as code which sets them, their actual use is going to happen in a later
patch.
