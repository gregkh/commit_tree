of: overlay: set node fields from properties when add new overlay node

Overlay nodes added by add_changeset_node() do not have the node
fields name, phandle, and type set.

The node passed to __of_attach_node() when the add node changeset
entry is processed does not contain any properties.  The node's
properties are located in add property changeset entries that will
be processed after the add node changeset is applied.

Set the node's fields in the node contained in the add node
changeset entry and do not set them to incorrect values in
add_changeset_node().

A visible symptom that is fixed by this patch is the names of nodes
added by overlays that have an entry in /sys/bus/platform/drivers/*/
will contain the unit-address but the node-name will be <NULL>,  for
example, "fc4ab000.<NULL>".  After applying the patch the name, in
this example, for node restart@fc4ab000 is "fc4ab000.restart".
