nvmet: fix the structure member indentation

This is a cleanup patch which fixes the structure member indentation
introduced by the p2p:

commit c6925093d0b2 ("nvmet: Optionally use PCI P2P memory").
We don't change any functionality in this patch.

This is needed so that any future members will also follow the uniform
indentation.
