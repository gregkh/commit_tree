kvm: rename last argument to kvm_get_dirty_log_protect

When manual dirty log reprotect will be enabled, kvm_get_dirty_log_protect's
pointer argument will always be false on exit, because no TLB flush is needed
until the manual re-protection operation.  Rename it from "is_dirty" to "flush",
which more accurately tells the caller what they have to do with it.
