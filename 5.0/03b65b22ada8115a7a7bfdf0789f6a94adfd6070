acpi/nfit, libnvdimm: Add disable passphrase support to Intel nvdimm.

Add support to disable passphrase (security) for the Intel nvdimm. The
passphrase used for disabling is pulled from an encrypted-key in the kernel
user keyring. The action is triggered by writing "disable <keyid>" to the
sysfs attribute "security".
