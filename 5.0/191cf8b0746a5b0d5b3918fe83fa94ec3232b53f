media: adv7604 added include of linux/interrupt.h

On older Kernels (prior to 4.15) irqreturn_t and devm_request_threaded_irq
is not defined when compiling adv7604.c. It seems more recent Kernels
include it via another header which is included by adv7604.c.
Now we include linux/interrupt.h explicitly to get the type also defined
for Kernels prior to 4.15.
