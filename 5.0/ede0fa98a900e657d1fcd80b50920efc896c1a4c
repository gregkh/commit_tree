KEYS: always initialize keyring_index_key::desc_len

syzbot hit the 'BUG_ON(index_key->desc_len == 0);' in __key_link_begin()
called from construct_alloc_key() during sys_request_key(), because the
length of the key description was never calculated.

The problem is that we rely on ->desc_len being initialized by
search_process_keyrings(), specifically by search_nested_keyrings().
But, if the process isn't subscribed to any keyrings that never happens.

Fix it by always initializing keyring_index_key::desc_len as soon as the
description is set, like we already do in some places.

The following program reproduces the BUG_ON() when it's run as root and
no session keyring has been installed.  If it doesn't work, try removing
pam_keyinit.so from /etc/pam.d/login and rebooting.

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <keyutils.h>

    int main(void)
    {
            int id = add_key("keyring", "syz", NULL, 0, KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING);

            keyctl_setperm(id, KEY_OTH_WRITE);
            setreuid(5000, 5000);
            request_key("user", "desc", "", id);
    }
