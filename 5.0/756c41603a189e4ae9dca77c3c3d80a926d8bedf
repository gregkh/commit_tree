net/mlx5e: ethtool, Support user configuration for RX hash fields

Enable user configuration of RX hash fields that are used for traffic
spreading into RX queues. User can change built-in RSS (Receive Side
Scaling) profiles on the following traffic types: UDP4, UDP6, TCP4 and
TCP6.  This configuration effects both outer and inner headers.  Added
support for ethtool commands: ETHTOOL_SRXFH and ETHTOOL_GRXFH.

Command example respectively:
$ethtool -N eth1 rx-flow-hash tcp4 sdfn
$ethtool -n eth1 rx-flow-hash tcpp4
