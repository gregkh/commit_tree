blk-mq: cache request hardware queue mapping

We call blk_mq_map_queue() a lot, at least two times for each
request per IO, sometimes more. Since we now have an indirect
call as well in that function. cache the mapping so we don't
have to re-call blk_mq_map_queue() for the same request
multiple times.
