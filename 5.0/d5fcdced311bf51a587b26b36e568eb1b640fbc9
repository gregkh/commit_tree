scsi: zfcp: use enum zfcp_erp_act_result for argument/return of affected functions

With that instead of just "int" it becomes clear which functions return
this type and which ones also accept it as argument they just pass through
in some cases or modify in other cases.  v2.6.27 commit 287ac01acf22
("[SCSI] zfcp: Cleanup code in zfcp_erp.c") introduced the enum which was
cpp defines previously.

Silence some false -Wswitch compiler warning cases with individual
NOP cases. When adding more enum values and building with W=1 we
would get compiler warnings about missed new cases.

Consistently use the variable name "result", so change "retval" in
zfcp_erp_strategy() to "result". This avoids confusion with other compile
unit variables "retval" having different semantics and type.
