blkcg: associate blkg when associating a device

Previously, blkg association was handled by controller specific code in
blk-throttle and blk-iolatency. However, because a blkg represents a
relationship between a blkcg and a request_queue, it makes sense to keep
the blkg->q and bio->bi_disk->queue consistent.

This patch moves association into the bio_set_dev macro(). This should
cover the majority of cases where the device is set/changed keeping the
two pointers consistent. Fallback code is added to
blkcg_bio_issue_check() to catch any missing paths.
