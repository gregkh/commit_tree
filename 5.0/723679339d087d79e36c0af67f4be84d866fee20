kconfig: warn no new line at end of file

It would be nice to warn if a new line is missing at end of file.

We could do this by checkpatch.pl for arbitrary files, but new line
is rather essential as a statement terminator in Kconfig.

The warning message looks like this:

  kernel/Kconfig.preempt:60:warning: no new line at end of file

Currently, kernel/Kconfig.preempt is the only file with no new line
at end of file. Fix it.

I know there are some false negative cases. For example, no warning
is displayed when the last line contains some whitespaces/comments,
but no new line. Yet, this commit works well for most cases.
