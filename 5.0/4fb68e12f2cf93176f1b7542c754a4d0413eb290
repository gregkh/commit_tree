ARM: vexpress/realview: consolidate immitation CPU hotplug

The only difference between the hotplug implementation for Realview
and Versatile Express are the bit in the auxiliary control register
to disable coherency.  Combine the two implentations accounting for
that difference.

Rename the functions to try to discourage cargo-cult copying of this
code.
