Input: elantech - enable 3rd button support on Fujitsu CELSIUS H780

Like Fujitsu CELSIUS H760, the H780 also has a three-button Elantech
touchpad, but the driver needs to be told so to enable the middle touchpad
button.

The elantech_dmi_force_crc_enabled quirk was not necessary with the H780.

Also document the fw_version and caps values detected for both H760 and
H780 models.
