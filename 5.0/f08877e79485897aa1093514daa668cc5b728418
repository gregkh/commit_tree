drm: BUG_ON if passing NULL parent to drm_dev_init

Previous commit removed the only reason why we were allowing NULL as
a parent device. With that resolved, we can enforce nobody else does
that mistake.

With that we can drop the ugly drm_dev_set_unique workaround.

v2: rebase, silence checkpatch "== NULL" warning
