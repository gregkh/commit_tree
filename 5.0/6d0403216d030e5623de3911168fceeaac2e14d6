net: core: dev: Add extack argument to __dev_change_flags()

In order to pass extack together with NETDEV_PRE_UP notifications, it's
necessary to route the extack to __dev_open() from diverse (possibly
indirect) callers. The last missing API is __dev_change_flags().

Therefore extend __dev_change_flags() with and extra extack argument and
update the two existing users.

Since the function declaration line is changed anyway, name the struct
net_device argument to placate checkpatch.
