net/mlx5: Consider encapsulation properties when comparing destinations

Currently the driver identifies identical vport destinations by
comparing the vport ID. The FW extended destination feature enables the
driver to forward the packet to the same vport with multiple
encapsulation properties.

Change the vport destination comparison logic to compare
the encapsulation properties in addition to the vport ID.
