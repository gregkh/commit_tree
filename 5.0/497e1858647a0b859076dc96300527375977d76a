kexec_file: kexec_walk_memblock() only walks a dedicated region at kdump

In kdump case, there exists only one dedicated memblock region as usable
memory (crashk_res). With this patch, kexec_walk_memblock() runs a given
callback function on this region.

Cosmetic change: 0 to MEMBLOCK_NONE at for_each_free_mem_range*()
