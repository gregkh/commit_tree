ALSA: hda/hdmi: Always set display_power_control for Intel HSW+ codecs

We've excluded the display_power_control flag for Intel HSW and BDW
codecs as the HD-audio controllers of the corresponding platforms take
care of the display power as well.  But the recent refactoring
separates the controller and the codec power accounting, so it's fine
to call the display PM even for HSW/BDW codecs.  This is less
confusing since we can avoid this well-hidden condition.
