selftests: extend zerocopy tests to udp

Both msg_zerocopy and udpgso_bench have udp zerocopy variants.
Exercise these as part of the standard kselftest run.

With udp, msg_zerocopy has no control channel. Ensure that the
receiver exits after the sender by accounting for the initial
delay in starting them (in msg_zerocopy.sh).
