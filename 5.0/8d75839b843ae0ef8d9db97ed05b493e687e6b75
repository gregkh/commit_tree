bpf, lpm: make longest_prefix_match() faster

At LPC 2018 in Vancouver, Vlad Dumitrescu mentioned that longest_prefix_match()
has a high cost [1].

One reason for that cost is a loop handling one byte at a time.

We can handle more bytes at a time, if enough attention is paid
to endianness.

I was able to remove ~55 % of longest_prefix_match() cpu costs.
