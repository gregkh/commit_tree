pvcalls-back: set -ENOTCONN in pvcalls_conn_back_read

When a connection is closing we receive on pvcalls_sk_state_change
notification. Instead of setting the connection as closed immediately
(-ENOTCONN), let's read one more time from it: pvcalls_conn_back_read
will set the connection as closed when necessary.

That way, we avoid races between pvcalls_sk_state_change and
pvcalls_back_ioworker.
