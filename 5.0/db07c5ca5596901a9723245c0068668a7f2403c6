media: cec: add debug_phys_addr module option

If debug_phys_addr is set, then CEC_CAP_PHYS_ADDR is added to the CEC
adapter capabilities.

This allows for testing CEC even if the physical address isn't set. This
makes it possible to connect two HDMI outputs together and still use CEC.
Very useful for testing CEC if you don't have access to an HDMI receiver
under linux.
