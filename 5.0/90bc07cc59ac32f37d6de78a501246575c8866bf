Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Add support for LPO clock

The Broadcom Bluetooth controllers support a secondary LPO clock at
32.768 kHz. This external clock provides low power timing, and also
a way to detect the frequency of the main reference clock. On many
designs without NVRAM and a non-default reference clock, this must
be used or the controller will not function correctly.
