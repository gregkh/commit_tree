arm64: acpi: Prepare for longer MADTs

The BAD_MADT_GICC_ENTRY check is a little too strict because
it rejects MADT entries that don't match the currently known
lengths. We should remove this restriction to avoid problems
if the table length changes. Future code which might depend on
additional fields should be written to validate those fields
before using them, rather than trying to globally check
known MADT version lengths.
