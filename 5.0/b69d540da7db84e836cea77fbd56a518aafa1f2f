selftests: add xfrm policy test script

add a script that adds a ipsec tunnel between two network
namespaces plus following policies:

.0/24 -> ipsec tunnel
.240/28 -> bypass
.253/32 -> ipsec tunnel

Then check that .254 bypasses tunnel (match /28 exception),
and .2 (match /24) and .253 (match direct policy) pass through the
tunnel.

Abuses iptables to check if ping did resolve an ipsec policy or not.

Also adds a bunch of 'block' rules that are not supposed to match.
