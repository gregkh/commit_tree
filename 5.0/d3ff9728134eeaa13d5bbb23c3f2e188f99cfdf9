clk: imx: Add imx composite clock

Since a lot of clocks on imx8m are formed by a mux, gate, predivider and
divider, the idea here is to combine all of those into one composite clock,
but we need to deal with both predivider and divider at the same time and
therefore we add the imx8m_clk_composite_divider_ops and register
the composite clock with those.
