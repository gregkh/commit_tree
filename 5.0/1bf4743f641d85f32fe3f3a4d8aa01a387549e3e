usb: chipidea: imx: Warn if oc polarity isn't specified

The polarity of the over current detection pin isn't configured on i.MX6/7
if it's unspecified in the device tree. So the actual configuration depends
on bootloader behavior which is bad.

So encourage users to fix their device tree by issuing a warning in this
case.
