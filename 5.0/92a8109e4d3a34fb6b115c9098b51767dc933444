cifs: Limit memory used by lock request calls to a page

The code tries to allocate a contiguous buffer with a size supplied by
the server (maxBuf). This could fail if memory is fragmented since it
results in high order allocations for commonly used server
implementations. It is also wasteful since there are probably
few locks in the usual case. Limit the buffer to be no larger than a
page to avoid memory allocation failures due to fragmentation.
