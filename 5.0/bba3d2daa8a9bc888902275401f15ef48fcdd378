rtc: nvmem: fix possible use after free

In cas of probe failure, devres may free the memory allocated for
rtc->nvram before devm_rtc_release_device() is called. This leads to
rtc_nvram_unregister using it after being freed which may lead to a crash.

This has been shown to happen after commit 461e557b9727 ("rtc: nvmem: use
devm_nvmem_register()")
