acpi/nfit, libnvdimm: Add freeze security support to Intel nvdimm

Add support for freeze security on Intel nvdimm. This locks out any
changes to security for the DIMM until a hard reset of the DIMM is
performed. This is triggered by writing "freeze" to the generic
nvdimm/nmemX "security" sysfs attribute.
