tools lib traceevent: Rename tep_is_file_bigendian() to tep_file_bigendian()

In order to make libtraceevent into a proper library, its API
should be straightforward.

After a discussion with Steven Rostedt, we decided to rename a few APIs,
to have more intuitive names.

This patch renames tep_is_file_bigendian() to tep_file_bigendian().
