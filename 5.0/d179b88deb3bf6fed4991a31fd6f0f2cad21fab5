drm/i915/fbdev: Actually configure untiled displays

If we skipped all the connectors that were not part of a tile, we would
leave conn_seq=0 and conn_configured=0, convincing ourselves that we
had stagnated in our configuration attempts. Avoid this situation by
starting conn_seq=ALL_CONNECTORS, and repeating until we find no more
connectors to configure.
