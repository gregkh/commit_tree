net: hns3: add common validation in hclge_dcb

Before setting tm related configuration to hardware, driver
needs to check the configuration provided by user is valid.
Currently hclge_ieee_setets and hclge_setup_tc both implement
their own checking, which has a lot in common.

This patch addes hclge_dcb_common_validate to do the common
checking. The checking in hclge_tm_prio_tc_info_update
and hclge_tm_schd_info_update is unnecessary now, so change
the return type to void, which removes the need to do error
handling when one of the checking fails.

Also, ets->prio_tc is indexed by user prio and ets->tc_tsa is
indexed by tc num, so this patch changes them to use different
index.
