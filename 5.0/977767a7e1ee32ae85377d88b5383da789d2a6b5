gfs2: Clean up gfs2_is_{ordered,writeback}

The gfs2_is_ordered and gfs2_is_writeback checks are weird in that they
implicitly check for !gfs2_is_jdata.  This makes understanding how to
use those functions correctly a challenge.  Clean this up by making
gfs2_is_ordered and gfs2_is_writeback take a super block instead of an
inode and by removing the implicit !gfs2_is_jdata checks.  Update the
callers accordingly.
