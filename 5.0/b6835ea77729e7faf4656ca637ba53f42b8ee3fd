ARC: define ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN = 8

The default value of ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN in "include/linux/slab.h" is
"__alignof__(unsigned long long)" which for ARC unexpectedly turns out
to be 4. This is not a compiler bug, but as defined by ARC ABI [1]

Thus slab allocator would allocate a struct which is 32-bit aligned,
which is generally OK even if struct has long long members.
There was however potetial problem when it had any atomic64_t which
use LLOCKD/SCONDD instructions which are required by ISA to take
64-bit addresses. This is the problem we ran into

The fix is to make sure slab allocations are 64-bit aligned.

Do note that atomic64_t is __attribute__((aligned(8)) which means gcc
does generate 64-bit aligned references, relative to beginning of
container struct. However the issue is if the container itself is not
64-bit aligned, atomic64_t ends up unaligned which is what this patch
ensures.
