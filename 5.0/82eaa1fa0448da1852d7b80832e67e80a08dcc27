net/mlx5e: FPGA, fix Innova IPsec TX offload data path performance

At Innova IPsec TX offload data path a special software parser metadata
is used to pass some packet attributes to the hardware, this metadata
is passed using the Ethernet control segment of a WQE (a HW descriptor)
header.

The cited commit might nullify this header, hence the metadata is lost,
this caused a significant performance drop during hw offloading
operation.

Fix by restoring the metadata at the Ethernet control segment in case
it was nullified.
