i2c: acpi: Return error pointers from i2c_acpi_new_device()

The caller would like to know the reason why the i2c_acpi_new_device() fails.
For example, if adapter is not available, it might be in the future and we
would like to re-probe the clients again. But at the same time we would like to
bail out if the error seems unrecoverable, such as invalid argument supplied.
To achieve this, return error pointer in some cases.
