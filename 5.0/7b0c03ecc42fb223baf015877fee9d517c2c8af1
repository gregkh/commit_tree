dmaengine: dw-dmac: implement dma protection control setting

This patch adds a new device-tree property that allows to
specify the dma protection control bits for the all of the
DMA controller's channel uniformly.

Setting the "correct" bits can have a huge impact on the
PPC460EX and APM82181 that use this DMA engine in combination
with a DesignWare' SATA-II core (sata_dwc_460ex driver).

In the OpenWrt Forum, the user takimata reported that:
|It seems your patch unleashed the full power of the SATA port.
|Where I was previously hitting a really hard limit at around
|82 MB/s for reading and 27 MB/s for writing, I am now getting this:
|
|root@OpenWrt:/mnt# time dd if=/dev/zero of=tempfile bs=1M count=1024
|1024+0 records in
|1024+0 records out
|real    0m 13.65s
|user    0m 0.01s
|sys     0m 11.89s
|
|root@OpenWrt:/mnt# time dd if=tempfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1024
|1024+0 records in
|1024+0 records out
|real    0m 8.41s
|user    0m 0.01s
|sys     0m 4.70s
|
|This means: 121 MB/s reading and 75 MB/s writing!
|
|The drive is a WD Green WD10EARX taken from an older MBL Single.
|I repeated the test a few times with even larger files to rule out
|any caching, I'm still seeing the same great performance. OpenWrt is
|now completely on par with the original MBL firmware's performance.

Another user And.short reported:
|I can report that your fix worked! Boots up fine with two
|drives even with more partitions, and no more reboot on
|concurrent disk access!

A closer look into the sata_dwc_460ex code revealed that
the driver did initally set the correct protection control
bits. However, this feature was lost when the sata_dwc_460ex
driver was converted to the generic DMA driver framework.
