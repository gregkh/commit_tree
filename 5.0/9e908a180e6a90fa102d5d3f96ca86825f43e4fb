platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Drop superfluous exported function

Since we've switched to the LED trigger for binding with HD-audio,
we can drop the exported function as well as the whole
linux/thinkpad_acpi.h.

The own TPACPI_LED_MUTE and TPACPI_LED_MICMUTE definitions are
replaced with the identical ones for LEDS, i.e. LED_AUDIO_MUTE and
LED_AUDIO_MICMUTE, respectively.  They are no longer needed as
referred only locally.
