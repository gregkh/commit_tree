printk: fix printk_time race.

Since printk_time can be toggled via /sys/module/printk/parameters/time ,
it is not safe to assume that output length does not change across
multiple msg_print_text() calls. If we hit this race, we can observe
failures such as SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_ALL writes more bytes than userspace
has supplied, SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD returns -EFAULT when succeeded,
SYSLOG_ACTION_READ reads garbage memory or even triggers an kernel oops
at _copy_to_user() due to integer overflow.

To close this race, get a snapshot value of printk_time and pass it to
SYSLOG_ACTION_READ, SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_ALL, SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD and
kmsg_dump_get_buffer().
