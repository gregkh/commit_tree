dm: Check for device sector overflow if CONFIG_LBDAF is not set

Reference to a device in device-mapper table contains offset in sectors.

If the sector_t is 32bit integer (CONFIG_LBDAF is not set), then
several device-mapper targets can overflow this offset and validity
check is then performed on a wrong offset and a wrong table is activated.

See for example (on 32bit without CONFIG_LBDAF) this overflow:

  # dmsetup create test --table "0 2048 linear /dev/sdg 4294967297"
  # dmsetup table test
  0 2048 linear 8:96 1

This patch adds explicit check for overflow if the offset is sector_t type.
