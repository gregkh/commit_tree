Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Handle specific unknown packets after firmware loading

The Broadcom controller on aries S5PV210 boards sends out a couple of
unknown packets after the firmware is loaded.  This will cause
logging of errors such as:
	Bluetooth: hci0: Frame reassembly failed (-84)

This is probably also the case with other boards, as there are related
Android userspace patches for custom ROMs such as
https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/LineageOS/android_system_bt/+/142721/
Since this appears to be intended behaviour, treated them as diagnostic
packets.

Note that this is another variant of commit 01d5e44ace8a
("Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Handle empty packet after firmware loading")
