xfs: end sync buffer I/O properly on shutdown error

As of commit e339dd8d8b ("xfs: use sync buffer I/O for sync delwri
queue submission"), the delwri submission code uses sync buffer I/O
for sync delwri I/O. Instead of waiting on async I/O to unlock the
buffer, it uses the underlying sync I/O completion mechanism.

If delwri buffer submission fails due to a shutdown scenario, an
error is set on the buffer and buffer completion never occurs. This
can cause xfs_buf_delwri_submit() to deadlock waiting on a
completion event.

We could check the error state before waiting on such buffers, but
that doesn't serialize against the case of an error set via a racing
I/O completion. Instead, invoke I/O completion in the shutdown case
regardless of buffer I/O type.
