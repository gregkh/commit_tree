KVM: arm/arm64: Introduce helpers to manipulate page table entries

Introduce helpers to abstract architectural handling of the conversion
of pfn to page table entries and marking a PMD page table entry as a
block entry.

The helpers are introduced in preparation for supporting PUD hugepages
at stage 2 - which are supported on arm64 but do not exist on arm.
