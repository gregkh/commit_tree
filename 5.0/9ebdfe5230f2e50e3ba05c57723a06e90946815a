kvm: nVMX: NMI-window and interrupt-window exiting should wake L2 from HLT

According to the SDM, "NMI-window exiting" VM-exits wake a logical
processor from the same inactive states as would an NMI and
"interrupt-window exiting" VM-exits wake a logical processor from the
same inactive states as would an external interrupt. Specifically, they
wake a logical processor from the shutdown state and from the states
entered using the HLT and MWAIT instructions.
