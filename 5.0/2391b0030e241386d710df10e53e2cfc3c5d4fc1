cxgb4: Remove SGE_HOST_PAGE_SIZE dependency on page size

The SGE Host Page Size has nothing to do with the actual
Host Page Size. It's the SGE's BAR2 Doorbell/GTS Page Size
for interpreting the SGE Ingress/Egress Queue per Page values.
Firmware reads all of these things and makes all the
subsequent changes necessary. The Host Driver uses the SGE
Host Page Size in order to properly calculate BAR2 Offsets.
