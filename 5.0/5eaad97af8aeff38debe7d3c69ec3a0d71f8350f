btrfs: Remove extent_io_ops::fill_delalloc

This callback is called only from writepage_delalloc which in turn is
guaranteed to be called from the data page writeout path. In the end
there is no reason to have the call to this function to be indrected via
the extent_io_ops structure. This patch removes the callback definition,
exports the function and calls it directly. No functional changes.
