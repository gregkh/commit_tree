datagram: consolidate datagram copy to iter helpers

skb_copy_datagram_iter and skb_copy_and_csum_datagram are essentialy
the same but with a couple of differences: The first is the copy
operation used which either a simple copy or a csum_and_copy, and the
second are the behavior on the "short copy" path where simply copy
needs to return the number of bytes successfully copied while csum_and_copy
needs to fault immediately as the checksum is partial.

Introduce __skb_datagram_iter that additionally accepts:
1. copy operation function pointer
2. private data that goes with the copy operation
3. fault_short flag to indicate the action on short copy
