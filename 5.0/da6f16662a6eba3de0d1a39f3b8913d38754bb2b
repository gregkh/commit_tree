KVM: arm64: Make vcpu const in vcpu_read_sys_reg

vcpu_read_sys_reg should not be modifying the VCPU structure.
Eventually, to handle EL2 sysregs for nested virtualization, we will
call vcpu_read_sys_reg from places that have a const vcpu pointer, which
will complain about the lack of the const modifier on the read path.
