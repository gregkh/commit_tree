{nl,mac}80211: report gate connectivity in station info

Capture the current state of gate connectivity from the mesh
formation field in mesh config whenever we receive a beacon,
and report that via GET_STATION.  This allows applications
doing mesh peering in userspace to make peering decisions
based on peers' current upstream connectivity.
