selftest/bpf: Use bpf_sk_lookup_{tcp, udp} in test_sock_addr

Use bpf_sk_lookup_tcp, bpf_sk_lookup_udp and bpf_sk_release helpers from
test_sock_addr programs to make sure they're available and can lookup
and release socket properly for IPv4/IPv4, TCP/UDP.

Reading from a few fields of returned struct bpf_sock is also tested.
