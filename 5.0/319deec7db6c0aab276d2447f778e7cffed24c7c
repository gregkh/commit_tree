seccomp: fix poor type promotion

sparse complains,

kernel/seccomp.c:1172:13: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
kernel/seccomp.c:1172:13:    expected restricted __poll_t [usertype] ret
kernel/seccomp.c:1172:13:    got int
kernel/seccomp.c:1173:13: warning: restricted __poll_t degrades to integer

Instead of assigning this to ret, since we don't use this anywhere, let's
just test it against 0 directly.
