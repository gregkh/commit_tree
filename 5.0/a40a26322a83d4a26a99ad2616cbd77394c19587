bpf: pass prog instead of env to bpf_prog_offload_verifier_prep()

Function bpf_prog_offload_verifier_prep(), called from the kernel BPF
verifier to run a driver-specific callback for preparing for the
verification step for offloaded programs, takes a pointer to a struct
bpf_verifier_env object. However, no driver callback needs the whole
structure at this time: the two drivers supporting this, nfp and
netdevsim, only need a pointer to the struct bpf_prog instance held by
env.

Update the callback accordingly, on kernel side and in these two
drivers.
