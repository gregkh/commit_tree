perf: arm_spe: handle devm_kasprintf() failure

devm_kasprintf() may return NULL on failure of internal allocation
thus the assignment to 'name' is not safe if unchecked. If NULL
is passed in for name then perf_pmu_register() would not fail
but rather silently jump to skip_type which is not the intent
here. As perf_pmu_register() may also return -ENOMEM returning
-ENOMEM in the (unlikely) failure case of devm_kasprintf() should
be fine here as well.
