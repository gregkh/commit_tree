KVM: VMX: Expose nested_vmx_allowed() to nested VMX as a non-inline

Exposing only the function allows @nested, i.e. the module param, to be
statically defined in vmx.c, ensuring we aren't unnecessarily checking
said variable in the nested code.  nested_vmx_allowed() is exposed due
to the need to verify nested support in vmx_{get,set}_nested_state().
The downside is that nested_vmx_allowed() likely won't be inlined in
vmx_{get,set}_nested_state(), but that should be a non-issue as they're
not a hot path.  Keeping vmx_{get,set}_nested_state() in vmx.c isn't a
viable option as they need access to several nested-only functions.
