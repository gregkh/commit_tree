net: dev: Add NETDEV_PRE_CHANGEADDR

The NETDEV_CHANGEADDR notification is emitted after a device address
changes. Extending this message to allow vetoing is certainly possible,
but several other notification types have instead adopted a simple
two-stage approach: first a "pre" notification is sent to make sure all
interested parties are OK with a change that's about to be done. Then
the change is done, and afterwards a "post" notification is sent.

This dual approach is easier to use: when the change is vetoed, nothing
has changed yet, and it's therefore unnecessary to roll anything back.
Therefore adopt it for NETDEV_CHANGEADDR as well.

To that end, add NETDEV_PRE_CHANGEADDR and an info structure to go along
with it.
