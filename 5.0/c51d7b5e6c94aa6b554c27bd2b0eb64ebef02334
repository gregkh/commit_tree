rcutorture: Print time since GP end upon forward-progress failure

If rcutorture's forward-progress tests fail while a grace period is not
in progress, it is useful to print the time since the last grace period
ended as a way to detect failure to launch a new grace period.  This
commit therefore makes this change.
