um: Remove unnecessary faulted check in uaccess.c

It is not necessary to check if a fault has occured or not
after disabling pagefaults. kmap_atomic does that in all
cases and we can disable it for 64 bit where kmap is not needed
and a simple page_address would suffice.

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1M
Before: 3.1GB/s. After: 3.5GB/s

There is a noticeable difference for file disk read and write
as well as less noticeable difference for network IO.
