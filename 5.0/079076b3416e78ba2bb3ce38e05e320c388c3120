block: remove deadline __deadline manipulation helpers

No users left since the removal of the legacy request interface, we can
remove all the magic bit stealing now and make it a normal field.

But use WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE on the new deadline field, given that we
don't seem to have any mechanism to guarantee a new value actually
gets seen by other threads.
