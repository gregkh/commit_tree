netfilter: nft_compat: use refcnt_t type for nft_xt reference count

Using standard integer type was fine while all operations on it were
guarded by the nftnl subsys mutex.

This isn't true anymore:
1. transactions are guarded only by a pernet mutex, so concurrent
   rule manipulation in different netns is racy
2. the ->destroy hook runs from a work queue after the transaction
   mutex has been released already.

cpu0                           cpu1 (net 1)        cpu2 (net 2)
 kworker
    nft_compat->destroy        nft_compat->init    nft_compat->init
      if (--nft_xt->ref == 0)   nft_xt->ref++        nft_xt->ref++

Switch to refcount_t.  Doing this however only fixes a minor aspect,
nft_compat also performs linked-list operations in an unsafe way.

This is addressed in the next two patches.
