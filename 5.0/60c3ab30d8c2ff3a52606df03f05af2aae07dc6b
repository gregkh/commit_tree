KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v2: Set active_source to 0 when restoring state

When restoring the active state from userspace, we don't know which CPU
was the source for the active state, and this is not architecturally
exposed in any of the register state.

Set the active_source to 0 in this case.  In the future, we can expand
on this and exposse the information as additional information to
userspace for GICv2 if anyone cares.
