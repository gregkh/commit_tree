staging: comedi: change do_insn*_ioctl to allow more samples

Changes do_insn*_ioctl functions to allow for data lengths for each
comedi_insn of up to 2^16.  This patch also changes these functions to only
allocate as much memory as is necessary for each comedi_insn, rather than
allocating a fixed-sized scratch space.

In testing some user-space code for the new INSN_DEVICE_CONFIG_GET_ROUTES
facility with some newer hardware, I discovered that do_insn_ioctl and
do_insnlist_ioctl limited the amount of data that can be passed into the
kernel for insn's to a length of 256.  For some newer hardware, the number
of routes can be greater than 1000.  Working around the old limits (256)
would complicate the user-space/kernel interaction.

The new upper limit is reasonable with current memory available and does
not otherwise impact the memory footprint for any current or otherwise
typical configuration.
