drm/i915/icl: Set TC type to unknown in the disconnection flow

Otherwise it would be in a inconsistent state as port is disconnected
but with a valid tc type.

Also setting it to unknown will earlier return
icl_tc_phy_disconnect() for any future calls to
intel_digital_port_connected(), this way we don't need to check if
port is marked as safe everytime.
