scsi: zfcp: move SG table helper from aux to fc and make them static

Since commit 663e0890e31c ("[SCSI] zfcp: remove access control tables
interface") these helper functions are only used for auto port scan in
zfcp_fc.c. Also change them to the corresponding namespace prefix.

This is a small cleanup for the miscellaneous catchall compile unit
zfcp_aux.c.
