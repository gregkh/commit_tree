blk-mq: change blk_mq_queue_busy() to blk_mq_queue_inflight()

There's a single user of this function, dm, and dm just wants
to check if IO is inflight, not that it's just allocated.

This fixes a hang with srp/002 in blktests with dm, where it tries
to suspend but waits for inflight IO to finish first. As it checks
for just allocated requests, this fails.
