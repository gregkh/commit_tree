ALSA: compress: Fix stop handling on compressed capture streams

It is normal user behaviour to start, stop, then start a stream
again without closing it. Currently this works for compressed
playback streams but not capture ones.

The states on a compressed capture stream go directly from OPEN to
PREPARED, unlike a playback stream which moves to SETUP and waits
for a write of data before moving to PREPARED. Currently however,
when a stop is sent the state is set to SETUP for both types of
streams. This leaves a capture stream in the situation where a new
start can't be sent as that requires the state to be PREPARED and
a new set_params can't be sent as that requires the state to be
OPEN. The only option being to close the stream, and then reopen.

Correct this issues by allowing snd_compr_drain_notify to set the
state depending on the stream direction, as we already do in
set_params.
