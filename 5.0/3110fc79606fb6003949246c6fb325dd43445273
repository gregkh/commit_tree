blk-mq: improve plug list sorting

Currently we only look at the software queue, but with support
for multiple maps, we should also look at the hardware queue.
This is important since we'll flush out the request list if
either the software queue or hardware queue don't match.

This sorts by software queue first, then hardware queue if
that differs. Finally we sort by request location like before.
This minimizes the flush points per plug list.
