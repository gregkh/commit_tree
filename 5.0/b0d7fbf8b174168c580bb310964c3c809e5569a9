soc: renesas: r8a77990-sysc: Fix initialization order of 3DG-{A,B}

The workaround for the wrong hierarchy of the 3DG-{A,B} power
domains on R-Car E3 ES1.0 corrected the parent domains.
However, the 3DG-{A,B} power domains were still initialized and powered
in the wrong order, causing 3DG operation to fail.

Fix this by changing the order in the table at runtime, when running on
an affected SoC.
