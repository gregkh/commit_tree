block/loop: Use global lock for ioctl() operation.

syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference [1] which is caused by
race condition between ioctl(loop_fd, LOOP_CLR_FD, 0) versus
ioctl(other_loop_fd, LOOP_SET_FD, loop_fd) due to traversing other
loop devices at loop_validate_file() without holding corresponding
lo->lo_ctl_mutex locks.

Since ioctl() request on loop devices is not frequent operation, we don't
need fine grained locking. Let's use global lock in order to allow safe
traversal at loop_validate_file().

Note that syzbot is also reporting circular locking dependency between
bdev->bd_mutex and lo->lo_ctl_mutex [2] which is caused by calling
blkdev_reread_part() with lock held. This patch does not address it.
