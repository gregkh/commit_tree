drm/msm/dpu: Remove dpu_dbg

The functions in dpu_dbg.c aren't used. The two main dump functions
fail after a lookup from dpu_dbg_base.reg_base_list which turns out
to never be populated and once those are removed the rest of the
file doesn't make any sense.

v3: No changes
v2: Moved some unrelated changes to another patch
