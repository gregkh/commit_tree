fs/epoll: remove max_nests argument from ep_call_nested()

Patch series "epoll: some miscellaneous optimizations".

The following are some incremental optimizations on some of the epoll
core.  Each patch has the details, but together, the series is seen to
shave off measurable cycles on a number of systems and workloads.

For example, on a 40-core IB, a pipetest as well as parallel
epoll_wait() benchmark show around a 20-30% increase in raw operations
per second when the box is fully occupied (incremental thread counts),
and up to 15% performance improvement with lower counts.

Passes ltp epoll related testcases.

This patch(of 6):

All callers pass the EP_MAX_NESTS constant already, so lets simplify
this a tad and get rid of the redundant parameter for nested eventpolls.
