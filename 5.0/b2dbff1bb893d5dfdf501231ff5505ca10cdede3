sbitmap: flush deferred clears for resize and shallow gets

We're missing a deferred clear off the shallow get, which can cause
a hang. Additionally, when we resize the sbitmap, we should also
flush deferred clears for good measure.

Ensure we have full coverage on batch clears, even for paths where
we would not be doing deferred clear. This makes it less error
prone for future additions.
