ksm: react on changing "sleep_millisecs" parameter faster

ksm thread unconditionally sleeps in ksm_scan_thread() after each
iteration:

	schedule_timeout_interruptible(
		msecs_to_jiffies(ksm_thread_sleep_millisecs))

The timeout is configured in /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/sleep_millisecs.

In case of user writes a big value by a mistake, and the thread enters
into schedule_timeout_interruptible(), it's not possible to cancel the
sleep by writing a new smaler value; the thread is just sleeping till
timeout expires.

The patch fixes the problem by waking the thread each time after the value
is updated.

This also may be useful for debug purposes; and also for userspace
daemons, which change sleep_millisecs value in dependence of system load.
