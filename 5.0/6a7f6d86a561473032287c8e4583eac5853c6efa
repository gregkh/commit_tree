blkcg: associate a blkg for pages being evicted by swap

A prior patch in this series added blkg association to bios issued by
cgroups. There are two other paths that we want to attribute work back
to the appropriate cgroup: swap and writeback. Here we modify the way
swap tags bios to include the blkg. Writeback will be tackle in the next
patch.
