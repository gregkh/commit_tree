ocfs2: improve ocfs2 Makefile

Included file path was hard-wired in the ocfs2 makefile, which might
causes some confusion when compiling ocfs2 as an external module.

Say if we compile ocfs2 module as following.
cp -r /kernel/tree/fs/ocfs2 /other/dir/ocfs2
cd /other/dir/ocfs2
make -C /path/to/kernel_source M=`pwd` modules

Acutally, the compiler wil try to find included file in
/kernel/tree/fs/ocfs2, rather than the directory /other/dir/ocfs2.

To fix this little bug, we introduce the var $(src) provided by kbuild.
$(src) means the absolute path of the running kbuild file.
