IB/hfi1: Unreserve a reserved request when it is completed

Currently, When a reserved operation is completed, its entry in the send
queue will not be unreserved, which leads to the miscalculation of
qp->s_avail and thus the triggering of a WARN_ON call trace. This patch
fixes the problem by unreserving the reserved operation when it is
completed.
