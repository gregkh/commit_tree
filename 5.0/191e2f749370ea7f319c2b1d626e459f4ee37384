scsi: lpfc: Correct errors accessing fw log

This patch corrects two issues:

- An oops would occur if reading based on a non-zero offset.  Offset
  calculation was incorrect.

- Updates to ras config (logging level) were ignored if change was
  made while fw logging was enabled. Revise to dynamically update.
