bpf: Expect !info.func_info and insn_off name changes in test_btf/libbpf/bpftool

Similar to info.jited_*, info.func_info could be 0 if
bpf_dump_raw_ok() == false.

This patch makes changes to test_btf and bpftool to expect info.func_info
could be 0.

This patch also makes the needed changes for s/insn_offset/insn_off/.
