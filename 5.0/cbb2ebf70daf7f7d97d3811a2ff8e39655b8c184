ALSA: usb-audio: Fix an out-of-bound read in create_composite_quirks

In `create_composite_quirk`, the terminating condition of for loops is
`quirk->ifnum < 0`. So any composite quirks should end with `struct
snd_usb_audio_quirk` object with ifnum < 0.

    for (quirk = quirk_comp->data; quirk->ifnum >= 0; ++quirk) {

    	.....
    }

the data field of Bower's & Wilkins PX headphones usb device device quirks
do not end with {.ifnum = -1}, wihch may result in out-of-bound read.

This Patch fix the bug by adding an ending quirk object.
