MIPS: ptrace: Remove FP support when CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n

When CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n we don't support floating point, so remove
the related ptrace support. Besides removing code which should not be
needed, this prepares us for the removal of FPU state in struct
task_struct which this code requires.
