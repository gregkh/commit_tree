drm/msm: Optimize adreno_show_object()

When the userspace tries to read the crashstate dump, the read side
implementation in the driver currently ascii85 encodes all the binary
buffers and it does this each time the read system call is called.
A userspace tool like cat typically does a page by page read and the
number of read calls depends on the size of the data captured by the
driver. This is certainly not desirable and does not scale well with
large captures.

This patch encodes the buffer only once in the read path. With this there
is an immediate >10X speed improvement in crashstate save time.
