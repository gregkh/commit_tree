rtc: add i.MX system controller RTC support

i.MX8QXP is an ARMv8 SoC which has a Cortex-M4 system controller
inside, the system controller is in charge of controlling power,
clock and secure rtc etc..

This patch adds i.MX system controller RTC driver support,
Linux kernel has to communicate with system controller via MU
(message unit) IPC to set/get RTC time and other alarm functions,
since the RTC set time needs to be done in secure EL3 mode (required
by system controller firmware) and alarm functions needs to be done
with general MU IRQ handle, these depend on other components which
are NOT ready, so this patch ONLY enables the RTC time read.
