irq/irq_sim: Store multiple interrupt offsets in a bitmap

Two threads can try to fire the irq_sim with different offsets and will
end up fighting for the irq_work asignment. Thomas Gleixner suggested a
solution based on a bitfield where we set a bit for every offset
associated with an interrupt that should be fired and then iterate over
all set bits in the interrupt handler.

This is a slightly modified solution using a bitmap so that we don't
impose a limit on the number of interrupts one can allocate with
irq_sim.
