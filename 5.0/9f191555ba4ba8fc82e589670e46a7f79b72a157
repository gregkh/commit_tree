dma-debug: Expose nr_total_entries in debugfs

Expose nr_total_entries in debugfs, so that {num,min}_free_entries
become even more meaningful to users interested in current/maximum
utilisation. This becomes even more relevant once nr_total_entries
may change at runtime beyond just the existing AMD GART debug code.
