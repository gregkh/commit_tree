drm/rockchip: fix for mailbox read size

Some of the functions (like cdn_dp_dpcd_read, cdn_dp_get_edid_block)
allow to read 64KiB, but the cdn_dp_mailbox_read_receive, that is
used by them, can read only up to 255 bytes at once. Normally, it's
not a big issue as DPCD or EDID reads won't (hopefully) exceed that
value.
The real issue here is the revocation list read during the HDCP
authentication process. (problematic use case:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/chromeos-4.4/drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/cdn-dp-reg.c#1152)
The list can reach 127*5+4 bytes (num devs * 5 bytes per ID/Bksv +
4 bytes of an additional info).
In other words - CTSes with HDCP Repeater won't pass without this
fix. Oh, and the driver will most likely stop working (best case
scenario).
