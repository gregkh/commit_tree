virtio-gpu: add VIRTIO_GPU_F_EDID feature

The feature allows the guest request an EDID blob (describing monitor
capabilities) for a given scanout (aka virtual monitor connector).

It brings a new command message, which has just a scanout field (beside
the standard virtio-gpu header) and a response message which carries the
EDID data.
