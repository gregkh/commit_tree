drm/rockchip: vop: add rk3188 hs_start interrupt as dsp_hold equivalent

The hs_start interrupt on rk3188 fires at the start of a new frame, so
serves essentially the same purpose as the dsp_hold_valid irq in checking
when the last frame got delivered when going to standby. So define it
to fix a hang on atomic_disable of the vop because the completion never
really completed before.
