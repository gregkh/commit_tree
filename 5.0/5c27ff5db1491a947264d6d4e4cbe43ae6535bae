mmc: tmio_mmc_core: don't claim spurious interrupts

I have encountered an interrupt storm during the eMMC chip probing (and
the chip finally didn't get detected).  It turned out that U-Boot left
the DMAC interrupts enabled while the Linux driver  didn't use those.
The SDHI driver's interrupt handler somehow assumes that, even if an
SDIO interrupt didn't happen, it should return IRQ_HANDLED.  I think
that if none of the enabled interrupts happened and got handled, we
should return IRQ_NONE -- that way the kernel IRQ code recoginizes
a spurious interrupt and masks it off pretty quickly...
