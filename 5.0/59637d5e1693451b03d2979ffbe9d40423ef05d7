integrity: support new struct public_key_signature encoding field

On systems with IMA-appraisal enabled with a policy requiring file
signatures, the "good" signature values are stored on the filesystem as
extended attributes (security.ima).  Signature verification failure
would normally be limited to just a particular file (eg. executable),
but during boot signature verification failure could result in a system
hang.

Defining and requiring a new public_key_signature field requires all
callers of asymmetric signature verification to be updated to reflect
the change.  This patch updates the integrity asymmetric_verify()
caller.
