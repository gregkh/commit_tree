tools: bpftool: fix crash with un-owned prog arrays

Prog arrays don't have 'owner_prog_type' and 'owner_jited'
fields in their fdinfo when they are created.  Those fields
are set and reported when first program is checked for
compatibility by bpf_prog_array_compatible().

This means that bpftool cannot expect the fields to always
be there.  Currently trying to show maps on a system with
an un-owned prog array leads to a crash:

$ bpftool map show
389: prog_array  name tail_call_map  flags 0x0
Error: key 'owner_prog_type' not found in fdinfo
Error: key 'owner_jited' not found in fdinfo
       key 4B  value 4B  max_entries 4  memlock 4096B
       Segmentation fault (core dumped)

We pass a NULL pointer to atoi().

Remove the assumption that fdinfo keys are always present.
Add missing validations and remove the p_err() calls which
may lead to broken JSON output as caller will not propagate
the failure.
