btrfs: Remove extent_io_ops::writepage_start_hook

This hook is called only from __extent_writepage_io which is already
called only from the data page writeout path. So there is no need to
make an indirect call via extent_io_ops. This patch just removes the
callback definition, exports the callback function and calls it directly
at the only call site. Also give the function a more descriptive name.
No functional changes.
