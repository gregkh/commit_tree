ip: validate header length on virtual device xmit

KMSAN detected read beyond end of buffer in vti and sit devices when
passing truncated packets with PF_PACKET. The issue affects additional
ip tunnel devices.

Extend commit 76c0ddd8c3a6 ("ip6_tunnel: be careful when accessing the
inner header") and commit ccfec9e5cb2d ("ip_tunnel: be careful when
accessing the inner header").

Move the check to a separate helper and call at the start of each
ndo_start_xmit function in net/ipv4 and net/ipv6.

Minor changes:
- convert dev_kfree_skb to kfree_skb on error path,
  as dev_kfree_skb calls consume_skb which is not for error paths.
- use pskb_network_may_pull even though that is pedantic here,
  as the same as pskb_may_pull for devices without llheaders.
- do not cache ipv6 hdrs if used only once
  (unsafe across pskb_may_pull, was more relevant to earlier patch)
