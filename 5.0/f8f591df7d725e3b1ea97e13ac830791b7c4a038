btrfs: introduce EXPORT_FOR_TESTS macro

Depending on whether CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_RUN_SANITY_TESTS is set, some BTRFS
functions are either local to the file they are implemented in and thus
should be declared static or are called from within the test
implementation defined in a different file.

Introduce an EXPORT_FOR_TESTS macro which depending on
CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_RUN_SANITY_TESTS either adds the 'static' keyword to a
function or not.
