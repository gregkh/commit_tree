dm: add memory barrier before waitqueue_active

Block core changes to switch bio-based IO accounting to be percpu had a
side-effect of altering DM core to now rely on calling waitqueue_active
(in both bio-based and request-based) to check if another task is in
dm_wait_for_completion().

A memory barrier is needed before calling waitqueue_active().  DM core
doesn't piggyback on a preceding memory barrier so it must explicitly
use its own.

For more details on why using waitqueue_active() without a preceding
barrier is unsafe, please see the comment before the waitqueue_active()
definition in include/linux/wait.h.

Add the missing memory barrier by switching to using wq_has_sleeper().
