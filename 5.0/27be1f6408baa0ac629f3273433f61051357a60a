dt-bindings: iio: adc: meson-saradc: add temperature sensor support

The 32-bit Meson8 SoC can use the SAR ADC to read the chip temperature.
This requires setting the correct TSC (temperature sensor coefficient),
which is programmed into the eFuse during the manufacturing process.
Meson8b and Meson8m2 are not supported yet because they have a 5-bit TSC
and only the first four bits are stored inside the SAR ADC registers.
