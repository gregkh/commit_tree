net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: fix vlan mcast

At this moment, mcast addresses are added for real device only
(reserved vlans for dual-emac mode), even if a mcast address was added
for some vlan only, thus ALE doesn't have corresponding vlan mcast
entries after vlan socket joined multicast group. So ALE drops vlan
frames with mcast addresses intended for vlans and potentially can
receive mcast frames for base ndev. That's not correct. So, fix it by
creating only vlan/mcast entries as requested. Patch doesn't use any
additional lists and is based on device mc address list and cpsw ALE
table entries.
