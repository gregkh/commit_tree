scripts: add spdxcheck.py self test

Add a script that will run spdxcheck.py through a couple of self tests to
simplify validation in the future.  The tests are run for both Python 2
and Python 3 to make sure all changes to the script remain compatible
across both versions.

The script tests a regular text file (Makefile) for basic sanity checks
and then runs it on a binary file (Documentation/logo.gif) to make sure it
works in both cases.  It also tests opening files passed on the command
line as well as piped files read from standard input.  Finally a run on
the complete tree will be performed to catch any other potential issues.
