nvmet: fix comparison of a u16 with -1

Currently the u16 req->error_loc is being compared to -1 which
will always be false.  Fix this by casting -1 to u16 to fix this.

Detected by clang:
  warning: result of comparison of constant -1 with expression of
  type 'u16' (aka 'unsigned short') is always false
  [-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare]
