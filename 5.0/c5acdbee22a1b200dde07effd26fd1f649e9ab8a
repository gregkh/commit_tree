net: stmmac: Send TSO packets always from Queue 0

The number of TSO enabled channels in HW can be different than the
number of total channels. There is no way to determined, at runtime, the
number of TSO capable channels and its safe to assume that if TSO is
enabled then at least channel 0 will be TSO capable.

Lets always send TSO packets from Queue 0.
