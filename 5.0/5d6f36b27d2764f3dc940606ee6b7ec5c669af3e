drm/i915: Don't apply the 16Gb DIMM wm latency w/a to BXT/GLK

The 16Gb DIMM w/a is not applicable to BXT or GLK. Limit it to
the appropriate platforms.

This was especially harsh on GLK since we don't even try to read
the DIMM information on that platforms, hence valid_dimm was
always false and thus we always tried to apply the w/a.
Furthermore the w/a pushed the level 0 latency above the
level 1 latency, which doesn't really make sense.

v2: Do the check when populating is_16gb_dimm (Mahesh)
