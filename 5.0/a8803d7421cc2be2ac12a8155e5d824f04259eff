mailbox: Support blocking transfers in atomic context

The mailbox framework supports blocking transfers via completions for
clients that can sleep. In order to support blocking transfers in cases
where the transmission is not permitted to sleep, add a new ->flush()
callback that controller drivers can implement to busy loop until the
transmission has been completed. A new mbox_flush() function can be
called by mailbox consumers in atomic context to make sure a transfer
has completed.
