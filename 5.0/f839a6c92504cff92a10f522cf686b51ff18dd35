net: Do not route unicast IP packets twice

Packets marked with 'offload_l3_fwd_mark' were already forwarded by a
capable device and should not be forwarded again by the kernel.
Therefore, have the kernel consume them.

The check is performed in ip{,6}_forward_finish() in order to allow the
kernel to process such packets in ip{,6}_forward() and generate required
exceptions. For example, ICMP redirects.
