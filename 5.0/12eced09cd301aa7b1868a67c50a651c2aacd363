clk: qcom: Leave mmss noc on for 8998

Similar to other qcom targets, gcc_mmss_noc_cfg_ahb_clk should not be
disabled.  Any mmss access depends on this clock, and its been observed
that enabling mmssnoc_axi_rpm_clk with rpmcc results in an implicit
access to mmss and will crash the system if gcc_mmss_noc_cfg_ahb_clk is
disabled.
