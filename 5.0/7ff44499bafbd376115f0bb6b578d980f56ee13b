scsi: smartpqi: correct volume status

- fix race condition when a unit is deleted after an RLL,
  and before we have gotten the LV_STATUS page of the unit.
  - In this case we will get a standard inquiry, rather than
    the desired page.  This will result in a unit presented
    which no longer exists.
  - If we ask for LV_STATUS, insure we get LV_STATUS
