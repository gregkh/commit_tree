tracing: Remove open-coding of hist trigger var_ref management

Have create_var_ref() manage the hist trigger's var_ref list, rather
than having similar code doing it in multiple places.  This cleans up
the code and makes sure var_refs are always accounted properly.

Also, document the var_ref-related functions to make what their
purpose clearer.
