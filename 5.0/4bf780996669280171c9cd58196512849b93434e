mmc: sdhci: Fix data command CRC error handling

Existing data command CRC error handling is non-standard and does not work
with some Intel host controllers. Specifically, the assumption that the host
controller will continue operating normally after the error interrupt,
is not valid. Change the driver to handle the error in the same manner
as a data CRC error, taking care to ensure that the data line reset is
done for single or multi-block transfers, and it is done before
unmapping DMA.
