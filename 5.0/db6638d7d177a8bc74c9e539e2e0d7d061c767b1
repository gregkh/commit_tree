blkcg: remove bio->bi_css and instead use bio->bi_blkg

Prior patches ensured that any bio that interacts with a request_queue
is properly associated with a blkg. This makes bio->bi_css unnecessary
as blkg maintains a reference to blkcg already.

This removes the bio field bi_css and transfers corresponding uses to
access via bi_blkg.
