KVM: PPC: Add load_from_eaddr and store_to_eaddr to the kvmppc_ops struct

The kvmppc_ops struct is used to store function pointers to kvm
implementation specific functions.

Introduce two new functions load_from_eaddr and store_to_eaddr to be
used to load from and store to a guest effective address respectively.

Also implement these for the kvm-hv module. If we are using the radix
mmu then we can call the functions to access quadrant 1 and 2.
