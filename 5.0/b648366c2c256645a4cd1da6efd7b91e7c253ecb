octeontx2-af: Add support for dynamic flow cfg to RSS field generation

Introduce state-based algorithm to convert the flow_key value
to RSS algo field used by NIX_AF_RX_FLOW_KEY_ALGX_FIELDX register.

The outer `for loop` goes over _all_ protocol field and the following
variables depict the state machine forward progress logic.

a) keyoff_marker - Enabled when hash byte length needs to be accounted
in field->key_offset update.
b) field_marker - Enabled when a new field needs to be selected.
c) group_member - Enabled when a protocol is part of a group.

This would remove the existing hard coding and enable to add
new protocol support seamlessly.
