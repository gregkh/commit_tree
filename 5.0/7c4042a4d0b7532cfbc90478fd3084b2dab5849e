scsi: lpfc: Fix dif and first burst use in write commands

When dif and first burst is used in a write command wqe, the driver was not
properly setting fields in the io command request. This resulted in no dif
bytes being sent and invalid xfer_rdy's, resulting in the io being aborted
by the hardware.

Correct the wqe initializaton when both dif and first burst are used.
