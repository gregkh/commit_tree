staging: mt7621-mmc: Fix incompletely removed #if 0 block in sd.c

Commit 2a54e3259e2a ("staging: mt7621-mmc: Remove #if 0 blocks in sd.c")
does not completely remove an #if 0 block in sd.c. This causes the function
msdc_select_clksrc() which was eariler not compiled, to be compiled.
That causes an error - MSDC_CLKSRC_REG is not defined.

This patch completely removes the #if 0 block
