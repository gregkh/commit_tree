net/mlx5: Return success for PAGE_FAULT_RESUME in internal error state

When the device is in internal error state, command interface isn't
accessible and the driver decides which commands to fail and which to
pass.
Move the PAGE_FAULT_RESUME command to the pass list in order to avoid
redundant failure messages.
