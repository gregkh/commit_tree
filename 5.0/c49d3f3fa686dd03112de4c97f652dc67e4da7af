staging: greybus: loopback.c: remove unused lists

gb_loopback_device::list_op_async is never used except for the
LIST_INIT. The ::list field appears to have a few more uses, but on
closer inspection the linked list of struct gb_loopbacks that it heads
is never used for anything, so there's no reason to maintain it, much
less to keep it sorted.
