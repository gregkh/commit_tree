arm64: move memstart_addr export inline

Since we define memstart_addr in a C file, we can have the export
immediately after the definition of the symbol, as we do elsewhere.

As a step towards removing arm64ksyms.c, move the export of
memstart_addr to init.c, where the symbol is defined.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
