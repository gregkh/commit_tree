crypto: arm64/chacha - optimize for arbitrary length inputs

Update the 4-way NEON ChaCha routine so it can handle input of any
length >64 bytes in its entirety, rather than having to call into
the 1-way routine and/or memcpy()s via temp buffers to handle the
tail of a ChaCha invocation that is not a multiple of 256 bytes.

On inputs that are a multiple of 256 bytes (and thus in tcrypt
benchmarks), performance drops by around 1% on Cortex-A57, while
performance for inputs drawn randomly from the range [64, 1024)
increases by around 30%.
