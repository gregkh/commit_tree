net: dp83640: expire old TX-skb

During sendmsg() a cloned skb is saved via dp83640_txtstamp() in
->tx_queue. After the NIC sends this packet, the PHY will reply with a
timestamp for that TX packet. If the cable is pulled at the right time I
don't see that packet. It might gets flushed as part of queue shutdown
on NIC's side.
Once the link is up again then after the next sendmsg() we enqueue
another skb in dp83640_txtstamp() and have two on the list. Then the PHY
will send a reply and decode_txts() attaches it to the first skb on the
list.
No crash occurs since refcounting works but we are one packet behind.
linuxptp/ptp4l usually closes the socket and opens a new one (in such a
timeout case) so those "stale" replies never get there. However it does
not resume normal operation anymore.

Purge old skbs in decode_txts().
