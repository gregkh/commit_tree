iio: magnetometer: Add driver support for PNI RM3100

PNI RM3100 is a high resolution, large signal immunity magnetometer,
composed of 3 single sensors and a processing chip with a MagI2C
interface.

Following functions are available:
 - Single-shot measurement from
   /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_magn_{axis}_raw
 - Triggerd buffer measurement.
 - DRDY pin for data ready trigger.
