dma-mapping: factor out dummy DMA ops

The dummy DMA ops are currently used by arm64 for any device which has
an invalid ACPI description and is thus barred from using DMA due to not
knowing whether is is cache-coherent or not. Factor these out into
general dma-mapping code so that they can be referenced from other
common code paths. In the process, we can prune all the optional
callbacks which just do the same thing as the default behaviour, and
fill in .map_resource for completeness.
