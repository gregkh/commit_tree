arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Force VM halt when changing the active state of GICv3 PPIs/SGIs

We currently only halt the guest when a vCPU messes with the active
state of an SPI. This is perfectly fine for GICv2, but isn't enough
for GICv3, where all vCPUs can access the state of any other vCPU.

Let's broaden the condition to include any GICv3 interrupt that
has an active state (i.e. all but LPIs).
