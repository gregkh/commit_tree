vsock: cope with memory allocation failure at socket creation time

In the unlikely event that the kmalloc call in vmci_transport_socket_init()
fails, we end-up calling vmci_transport_destruct() with a NULL vmci_trans()
and oopsing.

This change addresses the above explicitly checking for zero vmci_trans()
at destruction time.
