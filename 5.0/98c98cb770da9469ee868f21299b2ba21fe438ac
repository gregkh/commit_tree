block: clean up dead code that is now redundant

The boolean next_sorted is set to false and is never changed, hence
the code that checks if it is true is dead code and can now be
removed.  This dead code occurred from a previous commit that cleaned
up the elevator and removed the setting of next_sorted to true.
