ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix some section annotations

When building the kernel with Clang, the following section mismatch
warnings appears:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d398): Section mismatch in reference from
the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_iclk_autoidle()
The function _setup() references
the function __init _setup_iclk_autoidle().
This is often because _setup lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of _setup_iclk_autoidle is wrong.

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d3a0): Section mismatch in reference from
the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_reset()
The function _setup() references
the function __init _setup_reset().
This is often because _setup lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of _setup_reset is wrong.

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d408): Section mismatch in reference from
the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_postsetup()
The function _setup() references
the function __init _setup_postsetup().
This is often because _setup lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of _setup_postsetup is wrong.

_setup is used in omap_hwmod_allocate_module, which isn't marked __init
and looks like it shouldn't be, meaning to fix these warnings, those
functions must be moved out of the init section, which this patch does.
