btrfs: don't initialize 'offset' in map_private_extent_buffer()

In map_private_extent_buffer() the 'offset' variable is initialized to a
page aligned version of the 'start' parameter.

But later on it is overwritten with either the offset from the extent
buffer's start or 0.

So get rid of the initial initialization.
