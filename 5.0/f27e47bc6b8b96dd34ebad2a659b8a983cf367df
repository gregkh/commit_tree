staging: vchiq: use completions instead of semaphores

It is preferred in the kernel to avoid using semaphores to wait for
events, as they are optimised for the opposite situation; where the
common case is that they are available and may block only occasionally.
FYI see this thread: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/11/323.

Also completions are semantically more explicit in this case.
