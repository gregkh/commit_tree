clk: meson: meson8b: allow changing the CPU clock tree

Currently all clocks in the CPU clock tree are marked as read-only
(using the corresponding _ro_ clk_ops). This was correct since changing
the clock tree could cause the system to lock up.
Switch all clocks to their corresponding clk_ops variant which is not
read-only to allow changing the CPU clock tree since the bug which
locked up the system is now fixed (by switching the CPU clock temporary
to run off XTAL while changing the CPU clock tree).
