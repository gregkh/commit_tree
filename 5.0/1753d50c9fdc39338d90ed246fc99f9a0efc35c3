rapidio: consolidate RAPIDIO config entry in drivers/rapidio

There is no good reason to duplicate the RAPIDIO menu in various
architectures.  Instead provide a selectable HAVE_RAPIDIO symbol
that indicates native availability of RAPIDIO support and the handle
the rest in drivers/pci.  This also means we now provide support
for PCI(e) to Rapidio bridges for every architecture instead of a
limited subset.
