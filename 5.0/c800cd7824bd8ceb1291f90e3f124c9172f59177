firmware: imx: add SCU power domain driver

Some i.MX SoCs contain a system controller that is responsible for
controlling the state of the IPs that are present. Communication
between the host processor running an OS and the system controller
happens through a SCU protocol. This patch adds SCU protocol based
power domains drivers.
