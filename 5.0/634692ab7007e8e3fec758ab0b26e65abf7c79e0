s390/suspend: fix stack setup in swsusp_arch_suspend

The patch that added support for the virtually mapped kernel stacks changed
swsusp_arch_suspend to switch to the nodat-stack as the vmap stack is not
available while going in and out of suspend.

Unfortunately the switch to the nodat-stack is incorrect which breaks
suspend to disk.
