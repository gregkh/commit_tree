KVM: VMX: Explicitly reference RCX as the vmx_vcpu pointer in asm blobs

Use '%% " _ASM_CX"' instead of '%0' to dereference RCX, i.e. the
'struct vcpu_vmx' pointer, in the VM-Enter asm blobs of vmx_vcpu_run()
and nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw().  Using the symbolic name means that
adding/removing an output parameter(s) requires "rewriting" almost all
of the asm blob, which makes it nearly impossible to understand what's
being changed in even the most minor patches.

Opportunistically improve the code comments.
