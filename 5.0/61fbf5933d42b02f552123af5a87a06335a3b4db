net: bpfilter: restart bpfilter_umh when error occurred

The bpfilter_umh will be stopped via __stop_umh() when the bpfilter
error occurred.
The bpfilter_umh() couldn't start again because there is no restart
routine.

The section of the bpfilter_umh_{start/end} is no longer .init.rodata
because these area should be reused in the restart routine. hence
the section name is changed to .bpfilter_umh.

The bpfilter_ops->start() is restart callback. it will be called when
bpfilter_umh is stopped.
The stop bit means bpfilter_umh is stopped. this bit is set by both
start and stop routine.

Before this patch,
Test commands:
   $ iptables -vnL
   $ kill -9 <pid of bpfilter_umh>
   $ iptables -vnL
   [  480.045136] bpfilter: write fail -32
   $ iptables -vnL

All iptables commands will fail.

After this patch,
Test commands:
   $ iptables -vnL
   $ kill -9 <pid of bpfilter_umh>
   $ iptables -vnL
   $ iptables -vnL

Now, all iptables commands will work.
