powerpc/perf: Update perf_regs structure to include SIER

On each sample, Sample Instruction Event Register (SIER) content
is saved in pt_regs. SIER does not have a entry as-is in the pt_regs
but instead, SIER content is saved in the "dar" register of pt_regs.

Patch adds another entry to the perf_regs structure to include the "SIER"
printing which internally maps to the "dar" of pt_regs.

It also check for the SIER availability in the platform and present
value accordingly
