arm64: Add support for SB barrier and patch in over DSB; ISB sequences

We currently use a DSB; ISB sequence to inhibit speculation in set_fs().
Whilst this works for current CPUs, future CPUs may implement a new SB
barrier instruction which acts as an architected speculation barrier.

On CPUs that support it, patch in an SB; NOP sequence over the DSB; ISB
sequence and advertise the presence of the new instruction to userspace.
