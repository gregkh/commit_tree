rcu: Consolidate the RCU update functions invoked by sync.c

This commit retains all the various gp_ops[] entries, but makes their
update functions all be synchronize_rcu(), call_rcu() and rcu_barrier().
The read-side checks remain consistent with the various RCU flavors,
which still exist on the read side.
