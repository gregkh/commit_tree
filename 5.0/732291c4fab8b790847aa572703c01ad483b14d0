arm64: kexec_file: include linux/vmalloc.h

This is needed for compilation in some configurations that don't
include it implicitly:

arch/arm64/kernel/machine_kexec_file.c: In function 'arch_kimage_file_post_load_cleanup':
arch/arm64/kernel/machine_kexec_file.c:37:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'vfree'; did you mean 'kvfree'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
