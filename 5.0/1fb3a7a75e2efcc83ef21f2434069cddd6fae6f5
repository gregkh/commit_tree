igb: Fix an issue that PME is not enabled during runtime suspend

I210 ethernet card doesn't wakeup when a cable gets plugged. It's
because its PME is not set.

Since commit 42eca2302146 ("PCI: Don't touch card regs after runtime
suspend D3"), if the PCI state is saved, pci_pm_runtime_suspend() stops
calling pci_finish_runtime_suspend(), which enables the PCI PME.

To fix the issue, let's not to save PCI states when it's runtime
suspend, to let the PCI subsystem enables PME.
