x86/microcode/AMD: Add microcode container verification

Add container and patch verification functions to the AMD microcode
update driver.

These functions check whether a passed buffer contains the relevant
structure, whether it isn't truncated and (for actual microcode patches)
whether the size of a patch is not too large for a particular CPU family.
By adding these checks as separate functions the actual microcode loading
code won't get interspersed with a lot of checks and so will be more
readable.

 [ bp: Make all pr_err() calls into pr_debug() and drop the
   verify_patch() bits. ]
