arm64: KVM: Install stage-2 translation before enabling traps

It is a bit odd that we only install stage-2 translation after having
cleared HCR_EL2.TGE, which means that there is a window during which
AT requests could fail as stage-2 is not configured yet.

Let's move stage-2 configuration before we clear TGE, making the
guest entry sequence clearer: we first configure all the guest stuff,
then only switch to the guest translation regime.

While we're at it, do the same thing for !VHE. It doesn't hurt,
and keeps things symmetric.
