bpf: fix documentation for eBPF helpers

The missing indentation on the "Return" sections for bpf_map_pop_elem()
and bpf_map_peek_elem() helpers break RST and man pages generation. This
patch fixes them, and moves the description of those two helpers towards
the end of the list (even though they are somehow related to the three
first helpers for maps, the man page explicitly states that the helpers
are sorted in chronological order).

While at it, bring other minor formatting edits for eBPF helpers
documentation: mostly blank lines removal, RST formatting, or other
small nits for consistency.
