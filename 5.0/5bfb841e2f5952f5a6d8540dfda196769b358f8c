ALSA: fireface: add support for second optical interface for ADAT stream

Unlike Fireface 400, Fireface 800 have two pair of optical interface
for ADAT signal and S/PDIF signal. ADAT signals for the interface
are handled for sampling clock source separately.

This commit modifies a parser for clock configuration to distinguish
these two ADAT signals.
