mt76: remove wait argument from mt76x02_mcu_function_select

Remove wait argument from mt76x02_mcu_function_select and wait for
response when function is not Q_SELECT, what is the same behaviour
like in vendor driver.

Note this change behaviour for PCIe devices for Q_SELECT function
form wait to no-wait, and for mt76x0u BW_SETTING from no-wait to wait.
But the change is in align with vendor driver.
