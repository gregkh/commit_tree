Docs/EDID: Calculate CRC while building the code

The previous version made it necessary to first generate an
EDID data set without correct CRC and then to fix the CRC in
a second step. This patch adds the CRC calculation to the
makefile in such a way that a correct EDID data set is generated
in a single build step. Successfully tested with all existing
and a couple of new data sets.
