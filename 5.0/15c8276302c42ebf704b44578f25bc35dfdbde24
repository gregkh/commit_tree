btrfs: Remove 1st shrink/grow phase from balance

The first step of the rebalance process ensures there is 1MiB free on
each device. This number seems rather small. And in fact when talking to
the original authors their opinions were:

"man that's a little bonkers"
"i don't think we even need that code anymore"
"I think it was there to make sure we had room for the blank 1M at the
beginning. I bet it goes all the way back to v0"
"we just don't need any of that tho, i say we just delete it"

Clearly, this piece of code has lost its original intent throughout the
years. It doesn't really bring any real practical benefits to the
relocation process.

Additionally, this patch makes the balance process more lightweight by
removing a pair of shrink/grow operations which are rather expensive for
heavily populated filesystems. This is mainly due to shrink requiring
relocating block groups, involving heavy use of the btree.

The intermediate shrink/grow can fail and leave the filesystem in a
middle state that would need to be changed back by the user.
