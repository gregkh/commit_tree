btrfs: remove btrfs_bio_end_io_t

The btrfs_bio_end_io_t typedef was introduced with commit
a1d3c4786a4b ("btrfs: btrfs_multi_bio replaced with btrfs_bio")
but never used anywhere. This commit also introduced a forward declaration
of 'struct btrfs_bio' which is only needed for btrfs_bio_end_io_t.

Remove both as they're not needed anywhere.
