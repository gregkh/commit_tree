fanotify: introduce new event mask FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM

A new event mask FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM has been defined. This allows users
to receive events and grant access to files that are intending to be
opened for execution. Events of FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM type will be
generated when a file has been opened by using either execve(),
execveat() or uselib() system calls.

This acts in the same manner as previous permission event mask, meaning
that an access response is required from the user application in order
to permit any further operations on the file.
