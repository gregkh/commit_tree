net: thunderx: remove link change polling code and info from nicpf

Since link change polling routine was moved to nicvf side,
we don't need anymore polling function at nicpf side along
with link status info for all enabled Vfs as at VF side
this info is already tracked.

This commit is to remove unnecessary code & fields from
nicpf structure.
