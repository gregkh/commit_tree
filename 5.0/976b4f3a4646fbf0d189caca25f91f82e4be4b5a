selftests/bpf: Test [::] -> [::1] rewrite in sys_sendmsg in test_sock_addr

Test that sys_sendmsg BPF hook doesn't break sys_sendmsg behaviour to
rewrite destination IPv6 = [::] with [::1] (BSD'ism).

Two test cases are added:

1) User passes dst IPv6 = [::] and BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG program
   doesn't touch it.

2) User passes dst IPv6 != [::], but BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG program
   rewrites it with [::].

In both cases [::1] is used by sys_sendmsg code eventually and datagram
is sent successfully for unconnected UDP socket.

Example of relevant output:
  Test case: sendmsg6: set dst IP = [::] (BSD'ism) .. [PASS]
  Test case: sendmsg6: preserve dst IP = [::] (BSD'ism) .. [PASS]
