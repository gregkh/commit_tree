arm64: Add memory hotplug support

Wire up the basic support for hot-adding memory. Since memory hotplug
is fairly tightly coupled to sparsemem, we tweak pfn_valid() to also
cross-check the presence of a section in the manner of the generic
implementation, before falling back to memblock to check for no-map
regions within a present section as before. By having arch_add_memory(()
create the linear mapping first, this then makes everything work in the
way that __add_section() expects.

We expect hotplug to be ACPI-driven, so the swapper_pg_dir updates
should be safe from races by virtue of the global device hotplug lock.
