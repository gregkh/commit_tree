net: netem: use a list in addition to rbtree

When testing high-bandwidth TCP streams with large windows,
high latency, and low jitter, netem consumes a lot of CPU cycles
doing rbtree rebalancing.

This patch uses a linear list/queue in addition to the rbtree:
if an incoming packet is past the tail of the linear queue, it is
added there, otherwise it is inserted into the rbtree.

Without this patch, perf shows netem_enqueue, netem_dequeue,
and rb_* functions among the top offenders. With this patch,
only netem_enqueue is noticeable if jitter is low/absent.
