char: lp: properly count the lp devices

When the parallel port is usb based and the lp attaches to it based on
LP_PARPORT_AUTO, we do get /dev/lp0 and when we remove the usb device
/dev/lp0 is unregistered. If we now reconnect the usb device we get
our /dev/lp0 back. But if we now disconnect and reconnect eight times
we donot get any lp device and dmesg shows:

    lp: ignoring parallel port (max. 8)

Decrement the lp_count when the device detaches as this represents the
number of lp devices connected to the system.
