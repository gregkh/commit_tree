drm/i915/runtime_pm: Share code to enable/disable PCH reset handshake

Instead of have the same code spread into 4 platforms lets share it.
BXT do not have a PCH so here also handling this case by unseting
RESET_PCH_HANDSHAKE_ENABLE.

v2(Rodrigo):
- renamed to intel_pch_reset_handshake()
- added comment about why BXT need the bit to be unset

v3(Rodrigo and Ville):
- added bool have_pch to intel_pch_reset_handshake()
- added back BXT comment
