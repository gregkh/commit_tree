nvme: lock NS list changes while handling command effects

If a controller supports the NS Change Notification, the namespace
scan_work is automatically triggered after attaching a new namespace.

Occasionally the namespace scan_work may append the new namespace to the
list before the admin command effects handling is completed. The effects
handling unfreezes namespaces, but if it unfreezes the newly attached
namespace, its request_queue freeze depth will be off and we'll hit the
warning in blk_mq_unfreeze_queue().

On the next namespace add, we will fail to freeze that queue due to the
previous bad accounting and deadlock waiting for frozen.

Fix that by preventing scan work from altering the namespace list while
command effects handling needs to pair freeze with unfreeze.
