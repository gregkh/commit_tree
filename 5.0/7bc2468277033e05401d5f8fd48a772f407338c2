iwlwifi: mvm: force TCM re-evaluation on TCM resume

When traffic load is not low or low latency is active, TCM schedules
re-evaluation work so in case traffic stops TCM will detect that
traffic load has become low or that low latency is no longer active.
However, if TCM is paused when the re-evaluation work runs, it does
not re-evaluate and the re-evaluation work is no longer scheduled.
As a result, TCM will not indicate that low latency is no longer
active or that traffic load is low when traffic stops.

Fix this by forcing TCM re-evaluation when TCM is resumed in case
low latency is active or traffic load is not low.
