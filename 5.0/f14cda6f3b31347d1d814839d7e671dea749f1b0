iwlwifi: trans: parse and store debug ini TLVs

The new debug ini TLVs can be either packed into firmware
binary or written in external file. Support loading them
from both. Store the data per apply point. Apply point is
a point during driver runtime, where the TLV becomes active.
For example, a trigger of hardware error may be configured
to collect a subset of data pre-alive, as a opposed to HW
error that occurs after alive.
