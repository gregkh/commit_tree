perf jvmti: Separate jvmti cmlr check

The Compiled Method Load Record (cmlr) is JDK specific interface to
access JVM stack info. This makes the jvmti agent code not compile under
another jdk, which does not support that.

Separating jvmti cmlr check into special feature check, and adding
HAVE_JVMTI_CMLR macro to indicate that.

Mark cmlr code in jvmti/libjvmti.c with HAVE_JVMTI_CMLR, so we can
compile it on system without cmlr support.

This change makes the jvmti compile with java-1.8.0-ibm package. It's
without the line numbers support, but the rest works.

Adding NO_JVMTI_CMLR compile variable for testing.
