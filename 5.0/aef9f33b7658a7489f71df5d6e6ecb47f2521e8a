drm/i915: Ensure proper HDA suspend/resume ordering with a device link

In order to ensure that our system suspend and resume callbacks are
called in the correct order wrt. those of the HDA driver add a device
link to the HDA driver during audio component binding time. With i915 as
the supplier and HDA as the consumer the PM framework will guarantee
the HDA->i915 suspend (and shutdown) and i915->HDA resume order.

Atm, the lack of this ordering is not a problem, since all the i915
suspend/resume steps that need to be ordered wrt. the HDA driver's
suspend/resume steps are separated out to the i915
suspend_late/resume_early hooks. That will change in a follow-up
patchset where we'll need this ordering guarantee for steps that are in
the i915 suspend/resume hooks (and which can't be moved to
suspend_late/resume_early for other reasons). So this patch is a
preparation for that follow-up patchset.

The change also allows us to move towards removing the i915
suspend_late/resume_early hooks alltogether.

Since we only need to ensure the ordering during suspend/resume and not
during driver probing create the link with DL_FLAG_STATELESS. Since the
probe time ordering has to be optional we use the component framework
for that.

Similarly for runtime PM we depend on the audio driver getting/putting
an i915 runtime PM reference whenever it needs it (along with the proper
i915 display power domain) via the audio component ops get_power /
put_power hooks. So we create the device link without
DL_FLAG_PM_RUNTIME.

v2: (Ville)
- Add a note to the commit message about not using the device link
  runtime PM ordering.
- Handle the error return from device_link_add().
