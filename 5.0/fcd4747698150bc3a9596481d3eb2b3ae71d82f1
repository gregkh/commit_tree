xen/pvh: Move PVH entry code out of Xen specific tree

Once hypervisors other than Xen start using the PVH entry point for
starting VMs, we would like the option of being able to compile PVH entry
capable kernels without enabling CONFIG_XEN and all the code that comes
along with that. To allow that, we are moving the PVH code out of Xen and
into files sitting at a higher level in the tree.

This patch is not introducing any code or functional changes, just moving
files from one location to another.
