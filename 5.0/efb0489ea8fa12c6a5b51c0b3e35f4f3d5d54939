hwmon: (ina3221) Check channel status for alarms attribute read

There is nothing critically wrong to read these two attributes
without having a is_enabled() check at this point. But reading
the MASK_ENABLE register would clear the CVRF bit according to
the datasheet. So it'd be safer to fence for disabled channels
in order to add pm runtime feature.
