selftests/bpf: retry tests that expect build-id

While running test_progs in a loop I found out that I'm sometimes hitting
"Didn't find expected build ID from the map" error.

Looking at stack_map_get_build_id_offset() it seems that it is racy (by
design) and can sometimes return BPF_STACK_BUILD_ID_IP (i.e. can't trylock
current->mm->mmap_sem).

Let's retry this test a single time.

Fixes: 13790d1cc72c ("bpf: add selftest for stackmap with build_id in NMI context")
