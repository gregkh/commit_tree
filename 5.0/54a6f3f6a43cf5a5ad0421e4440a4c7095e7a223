scsi: target: add device vendor_id configfs attribute

The vendor_id attribute will allow for the modification of the T10 Vendor
Identification string returned in inquiry responses. Its value can be
viewed and modified via the ConfigFS path at:

target/core/$backstore/$name/wwn/vendor_id

"LIO-ORG" remains the default value, which is set when the backstore device
is enabled.
