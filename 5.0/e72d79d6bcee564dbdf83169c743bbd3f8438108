btrfs: Refactor find_free_extent loops update into find_free_extent_update_loop

We have a complex loop design for find_free_extent(), that has different
behavior for each loop, some even includes new chunk allocation.

Instead of putting such a long code into find_free_extent() and makes it
harder to read, just extract them into find_free_extent_update_loop().

With all the cleanups, the main find_free_extent() should be pretty
barebone:

find_free_extent()
|- Iterate through all block groups
|  |- Get a valid block group
|  |- Try to do clustered allocation in that block group
|  |- Try to do unclustered allocation in that block group
|  |- Check if the result is valid
|  |  |- If valid, then exit
|  |- Jump to next block group
|
|- Push harder to find free extents
   |- If not found, re-iterate all block groups
