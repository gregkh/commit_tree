powerpc, kexec_file: factor out memblock-based arch_kexec_walk_mem()

Memblock list is another source for usable system memory layout.
So move powerpc's arch_kexec_walk_mem() to common code so that other
memblock-based architectures, particularly arm64, can also utilise it.
A moved function is now renamed to kexec_walk_memblock() and integrated
into kexec_locate_mem_hole(), which will now be usable for all
architectures with no need for overriding arch_kexec_walk_mem().

With this change, arch_kexec_walk_mem() need no longer be a weak function,
and was now renamed to kexec_walk_resources().

Since powerpc doesn't support kdump in its kexec_file_load(), the current
kexec_walk_memblock() won't work for kdump either in this form, this will
be fixed in the next patch.
