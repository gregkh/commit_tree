drm/i915: Clarify flow for disabling IRQs on storms

This is rather confusing to look at as-is:
dev_priv->display.hpd_irq_setup(dev_priv); in intel_hpd_irq_handler()
handles disabling the actual HPD IRQ, while
intel_hpd_irq_storm_disable() handles moving the HPD pin state over from
MARK_DISABLED to DISABLED along with enabling polling for it.

Changes since v3:
- Rename i915_hpd_irq_storm_disable() to
  i915_hpd_irq_storm_switch_to_polling() - Rodrigo Vivi
