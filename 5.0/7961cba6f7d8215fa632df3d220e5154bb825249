scsi: lpfc: nvme: avoid hang / use-after-free when destroying localport

We cannot wait on a completion object in the lpfc_nvme_lport structure in
the _destroy_localport() code path because the NVMe/fc transport will free
that structure immediately after the .localport_delete() callback.  This
results in a use-after-free, and a hang if slub_debug=FZPU is enabled.

Fix this by putting the completion on the stack.
