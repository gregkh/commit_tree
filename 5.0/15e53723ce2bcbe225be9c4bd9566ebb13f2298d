soc: sunxi: sram: Enable EMAC clock access for H3 variant

Just like the A64 and H5, the H3 SoC uses the system control block
to enable the EMAC clock.

Add a variant structure definition for the H3 and use it over the A10
one. This will allow using the H3-specific binding for the syscon node
attached to the EMAC instead of the generic syscon binding.
