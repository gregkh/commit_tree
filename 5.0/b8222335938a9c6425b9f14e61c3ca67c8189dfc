ARM: dts: Fix wrong address for omap5 sata phy

Looks like I missed converting the omap5 sata phy addresses to use offset
from the module base instead of full physical address.

While at it, we can also more it to be a direct child of the interconnect
target module, it is not really a child of the ocp2scp control device.
