audit: Remove pointless check in insert_hash()

The audit_tree_group->mark_mutex is held all the time while we create
the fsnotify mark, add it to the inode, and insert chunk into the hash.
Hence mark cannot get detached during this time and so the check whether
the mark is attached in insert_hash() is pointless.
