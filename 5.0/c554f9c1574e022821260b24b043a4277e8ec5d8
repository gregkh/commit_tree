octeontx2-af: Teardown NPA, NIX LF upon receiving FLR

Upon receiving FLR IRQ for a RVU PF, teardown or cleanup
resources held by that PF_FUNC. This patch cleans up,
NIX LF
 - Stop ingress/egress traffic
 - Disable NPC MCAM entries being used.
 - Free Tx scheduler queues
 - Disable RQ/SQ/CQ HW contexts
NPA LF
 - Disable Pool/Aura HW contexts
In future teardown of SSO/SSOW/TIM/CPT will be added.

Also added a mailbox message for a RVU PF to request
AF, to perform FLR for a RVU VF under it.
