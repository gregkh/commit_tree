drm/omap: dsi: Fix OF platform depopulate

Commit edb715dffdee ("drm/omap: dss: dsi: Move initialization code from
bind to probe") moved the of_platform_populate() call from dsi_bind() to
dsi_probe(), but failed to move the corresponding
of_platform_depopulate() from dsi_unbind() to dsi_remove(). This results
in OF child devices being potentially removed multiple times. Fix it by
placing the of_platform_depopulate() call where it belongs.
