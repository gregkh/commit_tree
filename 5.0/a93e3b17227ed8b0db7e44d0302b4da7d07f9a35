switchdev: Add a blocking notifier chain

In general one can't assume that a switchdev notifier is called in a
non-atomic context, and correspondingly, the switchdev notifier chain is
an atomic one.

However, port object addition and deletion messages are delivered from a
process context. Even the MDB addition messages, whose delivery is
scheduled from atomic context, are queued and the delivery itself takes
place in blocking context. For VLAN messages in particular, keeping the
blocking nature is important for error reporting.

Therefore introduce a blocking notifier chain and related service
functions to distribute the notifications for which a blocking context
can be assumed.
