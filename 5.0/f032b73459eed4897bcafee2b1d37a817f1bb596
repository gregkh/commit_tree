KVM: PPC: Pass change type down to memslot commit function

Currently, kvm_arch_commit_memory_region() gets called with a
parameter indicating what type of change is being made to the memslot,
but it doesn't pass it down to the platform-specific memslot commit
functions.  This adds the `change' parameter to the lower-level
functions so that they can use it in future.
