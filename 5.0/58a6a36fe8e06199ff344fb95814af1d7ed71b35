drm/vc4: Use drm_atomic_helper_check_plane_state() to simplify the logic

drm_atomic_helper_check_plane_state() takes care of checking the
scaling capabilities and calculating the clipped X/Y offsets for us.

Rely on this function instead of open-coding the logic.

Incidentally, it seems to fix a problem we had with negative X/Y
positioning of YUV planes.
