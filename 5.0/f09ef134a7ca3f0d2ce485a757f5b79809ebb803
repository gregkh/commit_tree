iw_cxgb4: cq/qp mask depends on bar2 pages in a host page

Adjust the cq/qp mask based on the number of bar2 pages in a host page.

For user-mode rdma, the granularity of the BAR2 memory mapped to a user
rdma process during queue allocation must be based on the host page
size. The lld attributes udb_density and ucq_density are used to figure
out how many sge contexts are in a bar2 page. So the rdev->qpmask and
rdev->cqmask in iw_cxgb4 need to now be adjusted based on how many sge
bar2 pages are in a host page.

Otherwise the device fails to work on non 4k page size systems.
