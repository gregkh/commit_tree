drm/i915: Match code to comment and enforce ppgtt for execlists

Our execlist dispatch code requires a ppGTT so make sure we enforce that
option in intel_sanitize_enable_ppgtt(). The comment already tries to
explain that execlists requires ppgtt, but was written when gen8 may
have also taken the legacy path; so rewrite the code to match the
comment by using HAS_EXECLISTS() feature instead of the gen.
