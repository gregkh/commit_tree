ALSA: hda/realtek - Headset microphone and internal speaker support for System76 oryp5

On the System76 Oryx Pro (oryp5), there is a headset microphone input
attached to 0x19 that does not have a jack detect. In order to get it
working, the pin configuration needs to be set correctly, and the
ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE_NO_HP_MIC fixup needs to be applied. This is
similar to the MIC_NO_PRESENCE fixups for some Dell laptops, except we
have a separate microphone jack that is already configured correctly.

Since the ALC1220 does not have a fixup similar to
ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE_NO_HP_MIC, I have exposed the fixup from the
ALC269 in a way that it can be accessed from the
alc1220_fixup_system76_oryp5 function. In addition, the
alc1220_fixup_clevo_p950 needs to be applied to gain speaker output.
