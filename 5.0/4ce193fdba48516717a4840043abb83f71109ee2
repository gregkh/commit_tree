serial: sccnxp: Adds a delay between sequential read/write cycles

This patch adds a delay between sequential read/write cycles,
to ensure the required minimum inactive time (tRWD). A time value
from the datasheet has been added for each type of supported chips.
The “inline” compiler attribute has been removed from the
read/write functions, simply allow the compiler to control this.
