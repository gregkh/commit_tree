powerpc/ioda/npu: Call skiboot's hot reset hook when disabling NPU2

The skiboot firmware has a hot reset handler which fences the NVIDIA V100
GPU RAM on Witherspoons and makes accesses no-op instead of throwing HMIs:
https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/commit/fca2b2b839a67

Now we are going to pass V100 via VFIO which most certainly involves
KVM guests which are often terminated without getting a chance to offline
GPU RAM so we end up with a running machine with misconfigured memory.
Accessing this memory produces hardware management interrupts (HMI)
which bring the host down.

To suppress HMIs, this wires up this hot reset hook to vfio_pci_disable()
via pci_disable_device() which switches NPU2 to a safe mode and prevents
HMIs.
