lib/ioremap: ensure phys_addr actually corresponds to a physical address

The current ioremap() code uses a phys_addr variable at each level of page
table, which is confusingly offset by subtracting the base virtual address
being mapped so that adding the current virtual address back on when
iterating through the page table entries gives back the corresponding
physical address.

This is fairly confusing and results in all users of phys_addr having to
add the current virtual address back on.  Instead, this patch just updates
phys_addr when iterating over the page table entries, ensuring that it's
always up-to-date and doesn't require explicit offsetting.
