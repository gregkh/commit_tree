s390/qeth: conclude all event processing before offlining a card

Work for Bridgeport events is currently placed on a driver-wide
workqueue. If the card is removed and freed while any such work is still
active, this causes a use-after-free.
So put the events on a per-card queue, where we can control their
lifetime. As we also don't want stale events to last beyond an
offline & online cycle, flush this queue when setting the card offline.
