mm, hmm: replace hmm_devmem_pages_create() with devm_memremap_pages()

Commit e8d513483300 ("memremap: change devm_memremap_pages interface to
use struct dev_pagemap") refactored devm_memremap_pages() to allow a
dev_pagemap instance to be supplied.  Passing in a dev_pagemap interface
simplifies the design of pgmap type drivers in that they can rely on
container_of() to lookup any private data associated with the given
dev_pagemap instance.

In addition to the cleanups this also gives hmm users multi-order-radix
improvements that arrived with commit ab1b597ee0e4 "mm,
devm_memremap_pages: use multi-order radix for ZONE_DEVICE lookups"

As part of the conversion to the devm_memremap_pages() method of
handling the percpu_ref relative to when pages are put, the percpu_ref
completion needs to move to hmm_devmem_ref_exit().  See 71389703839e
("mm, zone_device: Replace {get, put}_zone_device_page...") for details.
