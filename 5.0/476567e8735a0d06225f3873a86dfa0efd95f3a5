mm: remove managed_page_count_lock spinlock

Now that totalram_pages and managed_pages are atomic varibles, no need of
managed_page_count spinlock.  The lock had really a weak consistency
guarantee.  It hasn't been used for anything but the update but no reader
actually cares about all the values being updated to be in sync.
