serial: 8250_pci: Make PCI class test non fatal

As has been reported the National Instruments serial cards have broken
PCI class.

The commit 7d8905d06405

  ("serial: 8250_pci: Enable device after we check black list")

made the PCI class check mandatory for the case when device is listed in
a quirk list.

Make PCI class test non fatal to allow broken card be enumerated.
