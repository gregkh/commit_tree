drm/amd/display: Fix NULL ptr deref for commit_planes_to_stream

[Why]
With scaling, underscan and abm changes we can end up calling
commit_planes_to_stream in commit_tail. This call uses dm_state->context
which can be NULL if the commit was a fast update.

[How]
Use dc_state instead since that can't be NULL unless the system ran
out of memory.
