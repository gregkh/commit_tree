doc: Make reader aware of rcu_dereference_protected

The whatisRCU.txt document says rcu_dereference() cannot be used
outside of rcu_read_lock() protected sections.  The commit adds a
mention of rcu_dereference_protected(), so that the new reader knows
that this API can be used to avoid update-side use of rcu_read_lock()
and rcu_read_unlock().
