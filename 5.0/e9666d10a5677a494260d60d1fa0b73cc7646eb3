jump_label: move 'asm goto' support test to Kconfig

Currently, CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL just means "I _want_ to use jump label".

The jump label is controlled by HAVE_JUMP_LABEL, which is defined
like this:

  #if defined(CC_HAVE_ASM_GOTO) && defined(CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL)
  # define HAVE_JUMP_LABEL
  #endif

We can improve this by testing 'asm goto' support in Kconfig, then
make JUMP_LABEL depend on CC_HAS_ASM_GOTO.

Ugly #ifdef HAVE_JUMP_LABEL will go away, and CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL will
match to the real kernel capability.
