net: aquantia: regression on cpus with high cores: set mode with 8 queues

Recently the maximum number of queues was increased up to 8, but
NIC was not fully configured for 8 queues. In setups with more than 4 CPU
cores parts of TX traffic gets lost if the kernel routes it to queues 4th-8th.

This patch sets a tx hw traffic mode with 8 queues.
