bpf: sk_msg, fix socket data_ready events

When a skb verdict program is in-use and either another BPF program
redirects to that socket or the new SK_PASS support is used the
data_ready callback does not wake up application. Instead because
the stream parser/verdict is using the sk data_ready callback we wake
up the stream parser/verdict block.

Fix this by adding a helper to check if the stream parser block is
enabled on the sk and if so call the saved pointer which is the
upper layers wake up function.

This fixes application stalls observed when an application is waiting
for data in a blocking read().
