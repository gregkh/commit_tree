net/smc: prevent races between smc_lgr_terminate() and smc_conn_free()

To prevent races between smc_lgr_terminate() and smc_conn_free() add an
extra check of the lgr field before accessing it, and cancel a delayed
free_work when a new smc connection is created.
This fixes the problem that free_work cleared the lgr variable but
smc_lgr_terminate() or smc_conn_free() still access it in parallel.
