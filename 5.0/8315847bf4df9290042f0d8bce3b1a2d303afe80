drm/i915: Clean up skl+ vs. icl+ watermark computation

Make a cleaner split between the skl+ and icl+ ways of computing
watermarks. This way skl_build_pipe_wm() doesn't have to know any
of the gritty details of icl+ master/slave planes.

We can also simplify a bunch of the lower level code by pulling
the plane visibility checks a bit higher up.

v2: WARN_ON(!visible) for the icl+ master plane case (Matt)
