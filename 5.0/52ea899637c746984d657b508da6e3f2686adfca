Input: add `REL_WHEEL_HI_RES` and `REL_HWHEEL_HI_RES`

This event code represents scroll reports from high-resolution wheels and
is modelled after the approach Windows uses. The value 120 is one detent
(wheel click) of movement. Mice with higher-resolution scrolling can send
fractions of 120 which must be accumulated in userspace. Userspace can either
wait for a full 120 to accumulate or scroll by fractions of one logical scroll
movement as the events come in. 120 was picked as magic number because it has
a high number of integer fractions that can be used by high-resolution wheels.

These new axes obsolete REL_WHEEL and REL_HWHEEL. The legacy axes are emulated
by the kernel but the most accurate (and most granular) data is available
through the new axes.
