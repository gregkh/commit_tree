kallsyms: lower alignment on ARM

As mentioned in the info pages of gas, the '.align' pseudo op's
interpretation of the alignment value is architecture specific.
It might either be a byte value or taken to the power of two.

On ARM it's actually the latter which leads to unnecessary large
alignments of 16 bytes for 32 bit builds or 256 bytes for 64 bit
builds.

Fix this by switching to '.balign' instead which is consistent
across all architectures.
