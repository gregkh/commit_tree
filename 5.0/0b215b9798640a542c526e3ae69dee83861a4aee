ipv6: gro: do not use slow memcmp() in ipv6_gro_receive()

ipv6_gro_receive() compares 34 bytes using slow memcmp(),
while handcoding with a couple of ipv6_addr_equal() is much faster.

Before this patch, "perf top -e cycles:pp -C <cpu>" would
see memcmp() using ~10% of cpu cycles on a 40Gbit NIC
receiving IPv6 TCP traffic.
