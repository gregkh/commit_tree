net: systemport: Fix WoL with password after deep sleep

Broadcom STB chips support a deep sleep mode where all register
contents are lost. Because we were stashing the MagicPacket password
into some of these registers a suspend into that deep sleep then a
resumption would not lead to being able to wake-up from MagicPacket with
password again.

Fix this by keeping a software copy of the password and program it
during suspend.
