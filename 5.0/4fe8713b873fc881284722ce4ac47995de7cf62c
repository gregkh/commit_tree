xtensa: SMP: fix ccount_timer_shutdown

ccount_timer_shutdown is called from the atomic context in the
secondary_start_kernel, resulting in the following BUG:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context

Use disable_irq_nosync instead of disable_irq to avoid it.
This is safe because the ccount timer IRQ is per-CPU, and once IRQ is
masked the ISR will not be called.
