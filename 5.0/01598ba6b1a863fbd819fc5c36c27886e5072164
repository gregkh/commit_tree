docs/mm: update kmalloc kernel-doc description

Add references to GFP documentation and the memory-allocation.rst and remove
GFP_USER, GFP_DMA and GFP_NOIO descriptions.

While on it slightly change the formatting so that the list of GFP flags
will be rendered as "description" in the generated html.
