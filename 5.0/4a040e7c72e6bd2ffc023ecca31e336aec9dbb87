power: supply: sc27xx: Save last battery capacity

Our charger manager can optimize the battery capacity periodically, so
we can save last battery capacity into registers. Then next system
power-on, we can read the last saved battery capacity as the initial
battery capacity, which can make the battery capacity more accurate.
