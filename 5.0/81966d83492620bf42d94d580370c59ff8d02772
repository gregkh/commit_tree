fs/proc/util.c: include fs/proc/internal.h for name_to_int()

name_to_int() is defined in fs/proc/util.c and declared in
fs/proc/internal.h, but the declaration isn't included at the point of
the definition.  Include the header to enforce that the definition
matches the declaration.

This addresses a gcc warning when -Wmissing-prototypes is enabled.
