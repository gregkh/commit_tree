pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a77980: Add QSPI pins, groups, and functions

Add the QSPI{0|1} pins/groups/functions to the R8A77980 PFC driver.

[Sergei: ported to the upstream driver, fixed up the swapped QSPI0 SPCLK/
SSL pins, fixed up the comments, moved the QSPI pins/groups/functions to
be in the alphanumeric order, removed unneeded empty lines, renamed the
patch.]
