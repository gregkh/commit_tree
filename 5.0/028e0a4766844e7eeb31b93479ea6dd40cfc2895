net: use indirect call wrappers at GRO transport layer

This avoids an indirect call in the receive path for TCP and UDP
packets. TCP takes precedence on UDP, so that we have a single
additional conditional in the common case.

When IPV6 is build as module, all gro symbols except UDPv6 are
builtin, while the latter belong to the ipv6 module, so we
need some special care.

v1 -> v2:
 - adapted to INDIRECT_CALL_ changes
v2 -> v3:
 - fix build issue with CONFIG_IPV6=m
