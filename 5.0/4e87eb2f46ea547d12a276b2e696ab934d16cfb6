scsi: lpfc: do not set queue->page_count to 0 if pc_sli4_params.wqpcnt is invalid

Certain older adapters such as the OneConnect OCe10100 may not have a valid
wqpcnt value.  In this case, do not set queue->page_count to 0 in
lpfc_sli4_queue_alloc() as this will prevent the driver from initializing.
