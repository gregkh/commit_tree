ASoC: q6asm-dai: dt-bindings: Add support to compress dais

This patch adds board specific bindings required for dais, In particular
for compressed dais and dai direction.

Board specific setup involves setting up some of dais as compressed dais
and also specify direction of any dai. Some of the dais might only
support capture/playback depending on the board level wiring.

These two new dt properties will allow such flexibilty at board level dts.
