scsi: zfcp: make DIX experimental, disabled, and independent of DIF

Introduce separate zfcp module parameters to individually select support
for: DIF which should work (zfcp.dif, which used to be DIF+DIX, disabled)
or DIX+DIF which can cause trouble (zfcp.dix, new, disabled).

If DIX is enabled, we warn on zfcp driver initialization.  As before, this
also reduces the maximum I/O request size to half, to support the worst
case of merged single sector requests with one protection data scatter
gather element per sector. This can impact the maximum throughput.

In DIF-only mode (zfcp.dif=1 zfcp.dix=0), we can use the full maximum I/O
request size as there is no protection data for zfcp.
