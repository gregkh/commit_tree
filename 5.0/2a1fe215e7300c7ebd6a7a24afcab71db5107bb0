audit: use current whenever possible

There are many places, notably audit_log_task_info() and
audit_log_exit(), that take task_struct pointers but in reality they
are always working on the current task.  This patch eliminates the
task_struct arguments and uses current directly which allows a number
of cleanups as well.
