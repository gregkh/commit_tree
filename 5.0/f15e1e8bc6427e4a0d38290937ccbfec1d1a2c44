NFSv4: don't require lock for get_renew_cred or get_machine_cred

This lock is no longer necessary.

If nfs4_get_renew_cred() needs to hunt through the open-state
creds for a user cred, it still takes the lock to stablize
the rbtree, but otherwise there are no races.

Note that this completely removes the lock from nfs4_renew_state().
It appears that the original need for the locking here was removed
long ago, and there is no longer anything to protect.
