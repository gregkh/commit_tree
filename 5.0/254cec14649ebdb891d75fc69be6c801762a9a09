mlxsw: spectrum: Change stage of ACL initialization

In Spectrum-2, MC routing is implemented using ACL block explicitly, so
router initialization should take place after ACL initialization.
Set the initialization of the ACL block before IP router initizalization
takes place, so multicast router will be able to allocate ACL data
structures and create its required chains.
