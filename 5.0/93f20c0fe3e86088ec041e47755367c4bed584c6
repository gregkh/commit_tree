perf record: Extend trace writing to multi AIO

Multi AIO trace writing allows caching more kernel data into userspace
memory postponing trace writing for the sake of overall profiling data
thruput increase. It could be seen as kernel data buffer extension into
userspace memory.

With an --aio option value different from 0 (default value is 1) the
tool has capability to cache more and more data into user space along
with delegating spill to AIO.

That allows avoiding to suspend at record__aio_sync() between calls of
record__mmap_read_evlist() and increases profiling data thruput at the
cost of userspace memory.
