tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Fix UART hang

If a serial console write occured while a UART transmit command was
waiting for a done signal then no further data would be sent until
something new kicked the system into gear. If there is already data
waiting in the circular buffer we must re-enable the tx watermark so we
receive the expected interrupts.
