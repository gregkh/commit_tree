scsi: lpfc: Correct code setting non existent bits in sli4 ABORT WQE

Driver is setting bits in word 10 of the SLI4 ABORT WQE (the wqid).  The
field was a carry over from a prior SLI revision. The field does not exist
in SLI4, and the action may result in an overlap with future definition of
the WQE.

Remove the setting of WQID in the ABORT WQE.

Also cleaned up WQE field settings - initialize to zero, don't bother to
set fields to zero.
