hv_netvsc: Fix hash key value reset after other ops

Changing mtu, channels, or buffer sizes ops call to netvsc_attach(),
rndis_set_subchannel(), which always reset the hash key to default
value. That will override hash key changed previously. This patch
fixes the problem by save the hash key, then restore it when we re-
add the netvsc device.
