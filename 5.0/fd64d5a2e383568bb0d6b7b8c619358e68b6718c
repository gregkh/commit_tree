selftests: forwarding: Add a skeleton of vxlan_bridge_1d

This skeleton sets up a topology with three VXLAN endpoints: one
"local", possibly offloaded, and two "remote", formed using veth pairs
and likely purely software bridges. The "local" endpoint is connected to
host systems by a VLAN-unaware bridge.

Since VXLAN tunnels must be unique per namespace, each of the "remote"
endpoints is in its own namespace. H3 forms the bridge between the three
domains.
