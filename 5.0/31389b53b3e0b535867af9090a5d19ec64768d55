i40e: define proper net_device::neigh_priv_len

Out of bound read reported by KASan.

i40iw_net_event() reads unconditionally 16 bytes from
neigh->primary_key while the memory allocated for
"neighbour" struct is evaluated in neigh_alloc() as

  tbl->entry_size + dev->neigh_priv_len

where "dev" is a net_device.

But the driver does not setup dev->neigh_priv_len and
we read beyond the neigh entry allocated memory,
so the patch in the next mail fixes this.
