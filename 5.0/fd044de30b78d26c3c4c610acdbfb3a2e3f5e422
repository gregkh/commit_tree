media: mceusb: Include three Hauppauge USB dvb device with IR rx

The three following Hauppauge USB DVB devices have IR receivers, but
lacked the support in mceusb to enable it:
- WinTV-HVR-935C
- WinTV-HVR-955Q
- WinTV-HVR-975

Tested HVR-955Q and HVR-975 plus RC5 remote and irw, works as intended.
