mtd: maps: Prepare merging of physmap and physmap_of

We want to merge the physmap and physmap_of driver, but before we can
do that we must prepare things to create physmap.o out of several .c
files. Rename physmap.c into physmap-core.c and add a new Makefile
rule to create physmap.o (right now it only contains physmap-core.o).
