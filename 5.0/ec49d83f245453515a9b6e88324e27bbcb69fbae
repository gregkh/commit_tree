net: dccp: initialize (addr,port) listening hashtable

Commit d9fbc7f6431f "net: tcp: prefer listeners bound to an address"
removes port-only listener lookups. This caused segfaults in DCCP
lookups because DCCP did not initialize the (addr,port) hashtable.

This patch adds said initialization.

The only non-trivial issue here is the size of the new hashtable.
It seemed reasonable to make it match the size of the port-only
hashtable (= INET_LHTABLE_SIZE) that was used previously. Other
parameters to inet_hashinfo2_init() match those used in TCP.

Tested: syzcaller issues fixed; the second patch in the patchset
        tests that DCCP lookups work correctly.
