batman-adv: Avoid WARN on net_device without parent in netns

It is not allowed to use WARN* helpers on potential incorrect input from
the user or transient problems because systems configured as panic_on_warn
will reboot due to such a problem.

A NULL return value of __dev_get_by_index can be caused by various problems
which can either be related to the system configuration or problems
(incorrectly returned network namespaces) in other (virtual) net_device
drivers. batman-adv should not cause a (harmful) WARN in this situation and
instead only report it via a simple message.

Fixes: b7eddd0b3950 ("batman-adv: prevent using any virtual device created on batman-adv as hard-interface")
