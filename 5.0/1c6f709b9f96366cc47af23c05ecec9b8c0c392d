perf intel-pt: Fix error with config term "pt=0"

Users should never use 'pt=0', but if they do it may give a meaningless
error:

	$ perf record -e intel_pt/pt=0/u uname
	Error:
	The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 22 (Invalid argument) for
	event (intel_pt/pt=0/u).

Fix that by forcing 'pt=1'.

Committer testing:

  # perf record -e intel_pt/pt=0/u uname
  Error:
  The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 22 (Invalid argument) for event (intel_pt/pt=0/u).
  /bin/dmesg | grep -i perf may provide additional information.

  # perf record -e intel_pt/pt=0/u uname
  pt=0 doesn't make sense, forcing pt=1
  Linux
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.020 MB perf.data ]
