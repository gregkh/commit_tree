staging: erofs: locked before registering for all new workgroups

Let's make sure that the one registering a workgroup will also
take the primary work lock at first for two reasons:
  1) There's no need to introduce such a race window (and consequently
     overhead) between registering and locking, other tasks could break
     in by chance, and the race seems unnecessary (no benefit at all);

  2) It's better to take the primary work when a workgroup
     is registered to apply the cache managed policy, for example,
     if some other tasks break in, it could turn into the in-place
     decompression rather than use as the cached decompression.
