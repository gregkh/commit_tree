isdn: i4l: isdn_tty: Fix some concurrency double-free bugs

The functions isdn_tty_tiocmset() and isdn_tty_set_termios() may be
concurrently executed.

isdn_tty_tiocmset
  isdn_tty_modem_hup
    line 719: kfree(info->dtmf_state);
    line 721: kfree(info->silence_state);
    line 723: kfree(info->adpcms);
    line 725: kfree(info->adpcmr);

isdn_tty_set_termios
  isdn_tty_modem_hup
    line 719: kfree(info->dtmf_state);
    line 721: kfree(info->silence_state);
    line 723: kfree(info->adpcms);
    line 725: kfree(info->adpcmr);

Thus, some concurrency double-free bugs may occur.

These possible bugs are found by a static tool written by myself and
my manual code review.

To fix these possible bugs, the mutex lock "modem_info_mutex" used in
isdn_tty_tiocmset() is added in isdn_tty_set_termios().
