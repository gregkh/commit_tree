ixgbe: don't clear_bit on xdp_ring->state if xdp_ring is null

There is an earlier check to see if xdp_ring is null when configuring
the tx ring, so assuming that it can still be null, the clearing of
the xdp_ring->state currently could end up with a null pointer
dereference.  Fix this by only clearing the bit if xdp_ring is not null.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1473795 ("Dereference after null check")
