ASoC: intel: cht_bsw_max98090_ti: Add pmc_plt_clk_0 quirk for Chromebook Clapper

The Clapper model Chromebook uses pmc_plt_clk_0 instead of pmc_plt_clk_3
for the mclk, just like the Swanky model.

This commit adds a DMI based quirk for this.

This fixing audio no longer working on these devices after
commit 648e921888ad ("clk: x86: Stop marking clocks as CLK_IS_CRITICAL")
that commit fixes us unnecessary keeping unused clocks on, but in case of
the Clapper that was breaking audio support since we were not using the
right clock in the cht_bsw_max98090_ti machine driver.
