arm64: kexec_file: forbid kdump via kexec_file_load()

Now that kexec_walk_memblock() can do the crash-kernel placement itself
architectures that don't support kdump via kexe_file_load() need to
explicitly forbid it.

We don't support this on arm64 until the kernel can add the elfcorehdr
and usable-memory-range fields to the DT. Without these the crash-kernel
overwrites the previous kernel's memory during startup.

Add a check to refuse crash image loading.
