virtio-net: ethtool configurable LRO

Virtio-net devices negotiate LRO support with the host.
Display the initially negotiated state with ethtool -k.

Also allow configuring it with ethtool -K, reusing the existing
virtnet_set_guest_offloads helper that configures LRO for XDP.
This is conditional on VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_GUEST_OFFLOADS.

Virtio-net negotiates TSO4 and TSO6 separately, but ethtool does not
distinguish between the two. Display LRO as on only if any offload
is active.

RTNL is held while calling virtnet_set_features, same as on the path
from virtnet_xdp_set.

Changes v1 -> v2
  - allow ethtool config (-K) only if VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_GUEST_OFFLOADS
  - show LRO as enabled if any LRO variant is enabled
  - do not allow configuration while XDP is active
  - differentiate current features from the capable set, to restore
    on XDP down only those features that were active on XDP up
  - move test out of VIRTIO_NET_F_CSUM/TSO branch, which is tx only
