ipv6: sr: clear IP6CB(skb) on SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation

skb->cb may contain data from previous layers (in an observed case
IPv4 with L3 Master Device). In the observed scenario, the data in
IPCB(skb)->frags was misinterpreted as IP6CB(skb)->frag_max_size,
eventually caused an unexpected IPv6 fragmentation in ip6_fragment()
through ip6_finish_output().

This patch clears IP6CB(skb), which potentially contains garbage data,
on the SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation.
