drm/i915: Rename the confusing 'plane_id' to 'color_plane'

A variable whose name is 'plane_id' is expected to be of the
enum plane_id type. In this case we have a raw int, which turns
out to refer to the plane of the framebuffer. Rename the variable
to 'color_plane' in line with the trend started earlier.
