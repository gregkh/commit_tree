tcp_bbr: update comments to reflect pacing_margin_percent

Recently, in commit ab408b6dc744 ("tcp: switch tcp and sch_fq to new
earliest departure time model"), the TCP BBR code switched to a new
approach of using an explicit bbr_pacing_margin_percent for shaving a
pacing rate "haircut", rather than the previous implict
approach. Update an old comment to reflect the new approach.
