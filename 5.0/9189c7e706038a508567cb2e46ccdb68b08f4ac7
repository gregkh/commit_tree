checkpatch: Create table of obsolete APIs and apply to RCU

This patch creates a deprecated_apis map, which allows such APIs to
be flagged with suggested replacements more compactly and straightforwardly.
It also uses this map to flag the old flavorful RCU APIs as deprecated,
suggesting their vanilla-RCU counterparts as replacements.
