test/net: Add script for VXLAN underlay in a VRF

This script tests the support of a VXLAN underlay in a non-default VRF.

It does so by simulating two hypervisors and two VMs, an extended L2
between the VMs with the hypervisors as VTEPs with the underlay in a
VRF, and finally by pinging the two VMs.

It also tests that moving the underlay from a VRF to another works when
down/up the VXLAN interface.
