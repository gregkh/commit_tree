sbitmap: ammortize cost of clearing bits

sbitmap maintains a set of words that we use to set and clear bits, with
each bit representing a tag for blk-mq. Even though we spread the bits
out and maintain a hint cache, one particular bit allocated will end up
being cleared in the exact same spot.

This introduces batched clearing of bits. Instead of clearing a given
bit, the same bit is set in a cleared/free mask instead. If we fail
allocating a bit from a given word, then we check the free mask, and
batch move those cleared bits at that time. This trades 64 atomic bitops
for 2 cmpxchg().

In a threaded poll test case, half the overhead of getting and clearing
tags is removed with this change. On another poll test case with a
single thread, performance is unchanged.
