pwm: Drop legacy wrapper for changing polarity

The API to configure a PWM using pwm_enable(), pwm_disable(),
pwm_config() and pwm_set_polarity() is superseeded by atomically setting
the parameters using pwm_apply_state(). To get forward with deprecating
the former set of functions use the opportunity that there is no current
user of pwm_set_polarity() and remove it.
