mtd: fix Coverity integer handling issue

A Coverity robot reported an integer handling issue
(OVERFLOW_BEFORE_WIDEN) in the potentially overflowing expression:

    (mtd_div_by_ws(mtd->size, mtd) - mtd_div_by_ws(offs, mtd)) *
    mtd_oobavail(mtd, ops)

While such overflow will certainly never happen due to the numbers
handled, it is cleaner to fix this operation anyway.

The problem is that all the maths include 32-bit quantities, while the
result is stored in an explicit 64-bit value.

As maxooblen will just be compared with a size_t, let's change the
type of the variable to a size_t. This will not fix anything but will
clarify a bit the situation. Then, do an explicit cast to fix Coverity
warning.
