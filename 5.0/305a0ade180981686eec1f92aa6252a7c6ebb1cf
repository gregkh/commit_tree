ALSA: hda - Serialize codec registrations

In the current code, the codec registration may happen both at the
codec bind time and the end of the controller probe time.  In a rare
occasion, they race with each other, leading to Oops due to the still
uninitialized card device.

This patch introduces a simple flag to prevent the codec registration
at the codec bind time as long as the controller probe is going on.
The controller probe invokes snd_card_register() that does the whole
registration task, and we don't need to register each piece
beforehand.
