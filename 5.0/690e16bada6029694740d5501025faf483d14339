arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rk3399-rockpro64 regulator gpios

Rockpro64 is not able boot if GPIO1_C1 pin is pulled high
before loading linux kernel.

In rockpro64 GPIO1_C1 pin is connected vdd_cpu_b regulator
VSEL pin. Pin should be pulled down in normal operation and
pulled high in suspend.

PMIC LDO_REG2 is connected to touch panel connector.
Rename regulator and set it to correct voltage.

PCIe power is controller by GPIO1_D0.
