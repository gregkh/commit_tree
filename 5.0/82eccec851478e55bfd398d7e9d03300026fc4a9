doc: rcu: Better clarify the rcu_segcblist ->len field

An important note under the rcu_segcblist description could use a more
detailed description. Especially explanation of the scenario where the
->head field may be temporarily NULL making it not wise to rely on it
to determine if callbacks are associated with the rcu_segcblist.
