MIPS: OCTEON: fix kexec support

Commit 62cac480f33f ("MIPS: kexec: Make a framework for both jumping and
halting on nonboot CPUs") broke the build of the OCTEON platform as
the relocated_kexec_smp_wait() is now static and not longer exported in
kexec.h.

Replace it by kexec_reboot() like it has been done in other places.
