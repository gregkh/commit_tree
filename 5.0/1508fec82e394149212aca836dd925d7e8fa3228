kconfig: split out code touching a file to conf_touch_dep()

conf_touch_deps() iterates over symbols, touching corresponding
include/config/*.h files as needed.

Split the part that touches a single file into a new helper so it can
be reused.

The new helper, conf_touch_dep(), takes a symbol name as a parameter,
and touches the corresponding include/config/*.h file.
