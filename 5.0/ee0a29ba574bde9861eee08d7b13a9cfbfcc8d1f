serial-uartlite: fix null pointer dereference on pointer port

Pointer port is dereferenced on port->private_data when assigning pointer
pdata before port is null checked, leading to a potential null pointer
dereference.  Fix this by assigning pdata after the null pointer check on
port.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1475434 ("Dereference before null check")
