USB: Add USB_QUIRK_DELAY_CTRL_MSG quirk for Corsair K70 RGB

To match the Corsair Strafe RGB, the Corsair K70 RGB also requires
USB_QUIRK_DELAY_CTRL_MSG to completely resolve boot connection issues
discussed here: https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/issues/42.
Otherwise roughly 1 in 10 boots the keyboard will fail to be detected.

Patch that applied delay control quirk for Corsair Strafe RGB:
