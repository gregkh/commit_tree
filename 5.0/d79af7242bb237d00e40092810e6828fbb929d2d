RDMA/device: Expose ib_device_try_get(()

It turns out future patches need this capability quite widely now, not
just for netlink, so provide two global functions to manage the
registration lock refcount.

This also moves the point the lock becomes 1 to within
ib_register_device() so that the semantics of the public API are very sane
and clear. Calling ib_device_try_get() will fail on devices that are only
allocated but not yet registered.
