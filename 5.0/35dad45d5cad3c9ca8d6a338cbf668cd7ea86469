drm/amd/display: Detach backlight from stream

[Why]
Backlight is conceptually a property of links, not streams.
All backlight programming is done on links, but there is a
stream property bl_pwm_level that is used to restore backlight
on dpms on and s3 resume.  This is unnecessary, as backlight
is already restored by hardware with no driver intervention.

[How]
Remove bl_pwm_level, and the stream argument to set_backlight
