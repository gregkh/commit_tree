tracing: Avoid -Wformat-nonliteral warning

Building with -Wformat-nonliteral, gcc complains

kernel/trace/trace_output.c: In function ‘seq_print_sym’:
kernel/trace/trace_output.c:356:3: warning: format not a string literal, argument types not checked [-Wformat-nonliteral]
   trace_seq_printf(s, fmt, name);

But seq_print_sym only has a single caller which passes "%s" as fmt, so
we might as well just use that directly. That also paves the way for
further cleanups that will actually make that format string go away
entirely.
