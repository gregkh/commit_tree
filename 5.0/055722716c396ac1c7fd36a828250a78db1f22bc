tipc: fix uninitialized value for broadcast retransmission

When sending broadcast message on high load system, there are a lot of
unnecessary packets restranmission. That issue was caused by missing in
initial criteria for retransmission.

To prevent this happen, just initialize this criteria for retransmission
in next 10 milliseconds.
