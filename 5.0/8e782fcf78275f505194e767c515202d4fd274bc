media: rc: ensure close() is called on rc_unregister_device

If userspace has an open file descriptor on the rc input device or lirc
device when rc_unregister_device() is called, then the rc close() is
never called.

This ensures that the receiver is turned off on the nuvoton-cir driver
during shutdown.
