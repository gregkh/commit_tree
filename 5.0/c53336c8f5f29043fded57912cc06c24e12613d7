mmc: core: align max segment size with logical block size

Logical block size is the lowest possible block size that the storage
device can address. Max segment size is often related with controller's
DMA capability. And it is reasonable to align max segment size with
logical block size.

SDHCI sets un-aligned max segment size, and causes ADMA error, so
fix it by aligning max segment size with logical block size.
