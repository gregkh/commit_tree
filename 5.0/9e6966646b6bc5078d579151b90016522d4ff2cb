ALSA: usb-audio: Add Opus #3 to quirks for native DSD support

This patch adds quirk VID/PID IDs for the Opus #3 DAP (made by 'The Bit')
in order to enable Native DSD support.

[ NOTE: this could be handled in the generic way with fp->dvd_raw if
  we add 0x10cb to the vendor whitelist, but since 0x10cb shows a
  different vendor name (Erantech), put to the individual entry at
  this time -- tiwai ]
