pstore: Map PSTORE_TYPE_* to strings

In later patches we will need to map types to names, so create a
constant table for that which can also be used in different parts of
old and new code. This saves the type in the PRZ which will be useful
in later patches.

Instead of having an explicit PSTORE_TYPE_UNKNOWN, just use ..._MAX.

This includes removing the now redundant filename templates which can use
a single format string. Also, there's no reason to limit the "is it still
compressed?" test to only PSTORE_TYPE_DMESG when building the pstorefs
filename. Records are zero-initialized, so a backend would need to have
explicitly set compressed=1.
