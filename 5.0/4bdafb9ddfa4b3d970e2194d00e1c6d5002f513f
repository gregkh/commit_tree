drm/i915: Remove i915.enable_ppgtt override

Now that we are confident in providing full-ppgtt where supported,
remove the ability to override the context isolation.

v2: Remove faked aliasing-ppgtt for testing as it no longer is accepted.
v3: s/USES/HAS/ to match usage and reject attempts to load the module on
old GVT-g setups that do not provide support for full-ppgtt.
v4: Insulate ABI ppGTT values from our internal enum (later plans
involve moving ppGTT depth out of the enum, thus potentially breaking
ABI unless we document the current values).
