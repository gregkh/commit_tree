memcg, oom: notify on oom killer invocation from the charge path

Burt Holzman has noticed that memcg v1 doesn't notify about OOM events via
eventfd anymore.  The reason is that 29ef680ae7c2 ("memcg, oom: move
out_of_memory back to the charge path") has moved the oom handling back to
the charge path.  While doing so the notification was left behind in
mem_cgroup_oom_synchronize.

Fix the issue by replicating the oom hierarchy locking and the
notification.
