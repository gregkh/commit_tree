rcutorture: Automatically create initrd directory

The rcutorture scripts currently expect the user to create the
tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/initrd directory.  Should the user
fail to do this, the kernel build will fail with obscure and confusing
error messages.  This commit therefore adds explicit checks for the
tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/initrd directory, and if not present,
creates one on systems on which dracut is installed.  If this directory
could not be created, a less obscure error message is emitted and the
test is aborted.

  severely abbreviate the initrd/init script. ]
