scsi: isci: initialize shost fully before calling scsi_add_host()

scsi_mq_setup_tags(), which is called by scsi_add_host(), calculates the
command size to allocate based on the prot_capabilities. In the isci
driver, scsi_host_set_prot() is called after scsi_add_host() so the command
size gets calculated to be smaller than it needs to be.  Eventually,
scsi_mq_init_request() locates the 'prot_sdb' after the command assuming it
was sized correctly and a buffer overrun may occur.

However, seeing blk_mq_alloc_rqs() rounds up to the nearest cache line
size, the mistake can go unnoticed.

The bug was noticed after the struct request size was reduced by commit
9d037ad707ed ("block: remove req->timeout_list")

Which likely reduced the allocated space for the request by an entire cache
line, enough that the overflow could be hit and it caused a panic, on boot,
at:

  RIP: 0010:t10_pi_complete+0x77/0x1c0
  Call Trace:
    <IRQ>
    sd_done+0xf5/0x340
    scsi_finish_command+0xc3/0x120
    blk_done_softirq+0x83/0xb0
    __do_softirq+0xa1/0x2e6
    irq_exit+0xbc/0xd0
    call_function_single_interrupt+0xf/0x20
    </IRQ>

sd_done() would call scsi_prot_sg_count() which reads the number of
entities in 'prot_sdb', but seeing 'prot_sdb' is located after the end of
the allocated space it reads a garbage number and erroneously calls
t10_pi_complete().

To prevent this, the calls to scsi_host_set_prot() are moved into
isci_host_alloc() before the call to scsi_add_host(). Out of caution, also
move the similar call to scsi_host_set_guard().
