dma-mapping: remove dma_zalloc_coherent()

dma_zalloc_coherent() is no longer needed as it has no users because
dma_alloc_coherent() already zeroes out memory for us.

The Coccinelle grammar rule that used to check for dma_alloc_coherent()
+ memset() is modified so that it just tells the user that the memset is
not needed anymore.
