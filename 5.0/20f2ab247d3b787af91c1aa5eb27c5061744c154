ASoC: max98373: Added max98373_reset for stable amp reset

This patch added max98373_reset function to avoid amp software reset failure and code duplication.
Reset verification step has been added for stable amp reset and it repeats verification maximum 3 times when it is failed.
Chip revision ID is available when the amp is in the idle state which means software reset is completed well.
Additional 10ms delay was added for every retrial and maximum 30ms delay can be applied.
