perf thread-stack: Fix thread stack processing for the idle task

perf creates a single 'struct thread' to represent the idle task. That
is because threads are identified by PID and TID, and the idle task
always has PID == TID == 0.

However, there are actually separate idle tasks for each CPU. That
creates a problem for thread stack processing which assumes that each
thread has a single stack, not one stack per CPU.

Fix that by passing through the CPU number, and in the case of the idle
"thread", pick the thread stack from an array based on the CPU number.
