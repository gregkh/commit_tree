ASoC: acpi: define common interface for machine driver configuration

The machine drivers may need information provided by the platform
driver.  Currently the information is passed using pdata specific to
each plaform driver. This prevents other drivers, such as SOF, from
reusing machine drivers directly.

Add a new structure which contains the required fields.

This proposal requires a bit more work on the platform side but this
generic interface helps reuse code directly.
