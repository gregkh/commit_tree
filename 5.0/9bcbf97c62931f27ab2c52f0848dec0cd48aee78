mips: add system call table generation support

The system call tables are in different format in all
architecture and it will be difficult to manually add,
modify or delete the syscall table entries in the res-
pective files. To make it easy by keeping a script and
which will generate the uapi header and syscall table
file. This change will also help to unify the implemen-
tation across all architectures.

The system call table generation script is added in
kernel/syscalls directory which contain the scripts to
generate both uapi header file and system call table
files. The syscall.tbl will be input for the scripts.

syscall.tbl contains the list of available system calls
along with system call number and corresponding entry
point. Add a new system call in this architecture will
be possible by adding new entry in the syscall.tbl file.

Adding a new table entry consisting of:
  	- System call number.
	- ABI.
	- System call name.
	- Entry point name.
	- Compat entry name, if required.

syscallhdr.sh, syscallnr.sh and syscalltbl.sh will gene-
rate uapi header unistd_n64/n32/o32.h, unistd_nr_n64/n32/-
o32.h and syscall_table_32_o32/64_n64/64-n32/64-o32.h files
respectively. All *.sh files will parse the content sys-
call.tbl to generate the header and table files. unistd-
_n64/n32/o32.h and unistd_nr_n64/n32/o32.h will be included
by uapi/asm/unistd.h and syscall_table_32_o32/64_n64/64-n32-
/64-o32.h is included by kernel/syscall_table32_o32/64-
_n64/64-n32/64-o32.S - the real system call table.

ARM, s390 and x86 architecuture does have similar support.
I leverage their implementation to come up with a generic
solution.
