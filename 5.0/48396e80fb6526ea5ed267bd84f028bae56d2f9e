RDMA/srp: Rework SCSI device reset handling

Since .scsi_done() must only be called after scsi_queue_rq() has
finished, make sure that the SRP initiator driver does not call
.scsi_done() while scsi_queue_rq() is in progress. Although
invoking sg_reset -d while I/O is in progress works fine with kernel
v4.20 and before, that is not the case with kernel v5.0-rc1. This
patch avoids that the following crash is triggered with kernel
v5.0-rc1:
