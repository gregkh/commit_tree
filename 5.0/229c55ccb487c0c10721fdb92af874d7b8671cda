arch: Move initrd= parsing into do_mounts_initrd.c

ARC, ARM, ARM64 and Unicore32 are all capable of parsing the "initrd="
command line parameter to allow specifying the physical address and size
of an initrd. Move that parsing into init/do_mounts_initrd.c such that
we no longer duplicate that logic.
