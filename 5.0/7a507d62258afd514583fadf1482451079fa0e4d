crypto: x86/chacha - add XChaCha12 support

Now that the x86_64 SIMD implementations of ChaCha20 and XChaCha20 have
been refactored to support varying the number of rounds, add support for
XChaCha12.  This is identical to XChaCha20 except for the number of
rounds, which is 12 instead of 20.  This can be used by Adiantum.
