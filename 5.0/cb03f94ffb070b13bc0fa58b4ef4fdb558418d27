fs/locks: merge posix_unblock_lock() and locks_delete_block()

posix_unblock_lock() is not specific to posix locks, and behaves
nearly identically to locks_delete_block() - the former returning a
status while the later doesn't.

So discard posix_unblock_lock() and use locks_delete_block() instead,
after giving that function an appropriate return value.
