HID: core: replace the collection tree pointers with indices

Previously, the pointer to the parent collection was stored. If a device
exceeds 16 collections (HID_DEFAULT_NUM_COLLECTIONS), the array to store
the collections is reallocated, the pointer to the parent collection becomes
invalid.

Replace the pointers with an index-based lookup into the collections array.
