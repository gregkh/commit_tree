powerpc: annotate implicit fall throughs

There is a plan to build the kernel with -Wimplicit-fallthrough and these
places in the code produced warnings, but because we build arch/powerpc
with -Werror, they became errors.  Fix them up.

This patch produces no change in behaviour, but should be reviewed in
case these are actually bugs not intentional fallthoughs.
