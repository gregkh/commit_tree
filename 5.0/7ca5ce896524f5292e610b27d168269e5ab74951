firmware: add Intel Stratix10 service layer driver

Some features of the Intel Stratix10 SoC require a level of privilege
higher than the kernel is granted. Such secure features include
FPGA programming. In terms of the ARMv8 architecture, the kernel runs
at Exception Level 1 (EL1), access to the features requires
Exception Level 3 (EL3).

The Intel Stratix10 SoC service layer provides an in kernel API for
drivers to request access to the secure features. The requests are queued
and processed one by one. ARMâ€™s SMCCC is used to pass the execution
of the requests on to a secure monitor (EL3).

The header file stratix10-sve-client.h defines the interface between
service providers (FPGA manager is one of them) and service layer.

The header file stratix10-smc.h defines the secure monitor call (SMC)
message protocols used for service layer driver in normal world
(EL1) to communicate with secure monitor SW in secure monitor exception
level 3 (EL3).
