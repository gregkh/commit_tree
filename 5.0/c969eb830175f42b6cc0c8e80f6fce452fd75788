Document /proc/pid PID reuse behavior

State explicitly that holding a /proc/pid file descriptor open does
not reserve the PID. Also note that in the event of PID reuse, these
open file descriptors refer to the old, now-dead process, and not the
new one that happens to be named the same numeric PID.
