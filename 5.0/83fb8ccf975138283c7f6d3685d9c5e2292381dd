powerpc/powernv/npu: Convert NPU IOMMU helpers to iommu_table_group_ops

At the moment NPU IOMMU is manipulated directly from the IODA2 PCI
PE code; PCI PE acts as a master to NPU PE. Soon we will have compound
IOMMU groups with several PEs from several different PHB (such as
interconnected GPUs and NPUs) so there will be no single master but
a one big IOMMU group.

This makes a first step and converts an NPU PE with a set of extern
function to a table group.

This should cause no behavioral change. Note that
pnv_npu_release_ownership() has never been implemented.
