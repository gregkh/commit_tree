userfaultfd: convert userfaultfd_ctx::refcount to refcount_t

Reference counters should use refcount_t rather than atomic_t, since the
refcount_t implementation can prevent overflows, reducing the
exploitability of reference leak bugs.  userfaultfd_ctx::refcount is a
reference counter with the usual semantics, so convert it to refcount_t.

Note: I replaced the BUG() on incrementing a 0 refcount with just
refcount_inc(), since part of the semantics of refcount_t is that that
incrementing a 0 refcount is not allowed; with CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL,
refcount_inc() already checks for it and warns.
