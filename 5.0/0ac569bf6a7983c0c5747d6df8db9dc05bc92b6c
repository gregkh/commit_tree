ARM: 8834/1: Fix: kprobes: optimized kprobes illegal instruction

commit e46daee53bb5 ("ARM: 8806/1: kprobes: Fix false positive with
FORTIFY_SOURCE") introduced a regression in optimized kprobes. It
triggers "invalid instruction" oopses when using kprobes instrumentation
through lttng and perf. This commit was introduced in kernel v4.20, and
has been backported to stable kernels 4.19 and 4.14.

This crash was also reported by Hongzhi Song on the redhat bugzilla
where the patch was originally introduced.
