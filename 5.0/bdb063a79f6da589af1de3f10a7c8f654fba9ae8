crypto: arm/chacha - add XChaCha12 support

Now that the 32-bit ARM NEON implementation of ChaCha20 and XChaCha20
has been refactored to support varying the number of rounds, add support
for XChaCha12.  This is identical to XChaCha20 except for the number of
rounds, which is 12 instead of 20.

XChaCha12 is faster than XChaCha20 but has a lower security margin,
though still greater than AES-256's since the best known attacks make it
through only 7 rounds.  See the patch "crypto: chacha - add XChaCha12
support" for more details about why we need XChaCha12 support.
