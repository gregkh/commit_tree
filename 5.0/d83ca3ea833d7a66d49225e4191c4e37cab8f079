scsi: lpfc: Correct loss of fc4 type on remote port address change

An address change for a remote port cause PRLI for the wrong protocol
to be sent.  The node copy done in the discovery code skipped copying
the fc4 protocols supported as well.

Fix the copy logic for the address change.  Beefed up log messages in
this area as well.
