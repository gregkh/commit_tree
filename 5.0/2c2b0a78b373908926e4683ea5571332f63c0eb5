ring-buffer: Add percentage of ring buffer full to wake up reader

Instead of just waiting for a page to be full before waking up a pending
reader, allow the reader to pass in a "percentage" of pages that have
content before waking up a reader. This should help keep the process of
reading the events not cause wake ups that constantly cause reading of the
buffer.
