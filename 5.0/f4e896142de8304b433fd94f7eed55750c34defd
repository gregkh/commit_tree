bnxt_en: Do not modify max_stat_ctxs after RDMA driver requests/frees stat_ctxs

Calling bnxt_set_max_func_stat_ctxs() to modify max stat_ctxs requested
or freed by the RDMA driver is wrong. After introducing reservation of
resources recently, the driver has to keep track of all stat_ctxs
including the ones used by the RDMA driver.  This will provide a better
foundation for accurate accounting of the stat_ctxs.
