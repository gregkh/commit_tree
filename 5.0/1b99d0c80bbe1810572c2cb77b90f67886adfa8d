pinctrl: sh-pfc: sh7264: Fix PFCR3 and PFCR0 register configuration

The Port F Control Register 3 (PFCR3) contains only a single field.
However, counting from left to right, it is the fourth field, not the
first field.
Insert the missing dummy configuration values (3 fields of 16 values) to
fix this.

The descriptor for the Port F Control Register 0 (PFCR0) lacks the
description for the 4th field (PF0 Mode, PF0MD[2:0]).
Add the missing configuration values to fix this.
