Revert "mm: use early_pfn_to_nid in page_ext_init"

This reverts commit fe53ca54270a ("mm: use early_pfn_to_nid in
page_ext_init").

When booting a system with "page_owner=on",

start_kernel
  page_ext_init
    invoke_init_callbacks
      init_section_page_ext
        init_page_owner
          init_early_allocated_pages
            init_zones_in_node
              init_pages_in_zone
                lookup_page_ext
                  page_to_nid

The issue here is that page_to_nid() will not work since some page flags
have no node information until later in page_alloc_init_late() due to
DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT.  Hence, it could trigger an out-of-bounds
access with an invalid nid.

  UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in ./include/linux/mm.h:1104:50
  index 7 is out of range for type 'zone [5]'

Also, kernel will panic since flags were poisoned earlier with,

CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGFLAGS=y
CONFIG_NODE_NOT_IN_PAGE_FLAGS=n

start_kernel
  setup_arch
    pagetable_init
      paging_init
        sparse_init
          sparse_init_nid
            memblock_alloc_try_nid_raw

It did not handle it well in init_pages_in_zone() which ends up calling
page_to_nid().

  page:ffffea0004200000 is uninitialized and poisoned
  raw: ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff
  raw: ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff
  page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PagePoisoned(p))
  page_owner info is not active (free page?)
  kernel BUG at include/linux/mm.h:990!
  RIP: 0010:init_page_owner+0x486/0x520

This means that assumptions behind commit fe53ca54270a ("mm: use
early_pfn_to_nid in page_ext_init") are incomplete.  Therefore, revert
the commit for now.  A proper way to move the page_owner initialization
to sooner is to hook into memmap initialization.
