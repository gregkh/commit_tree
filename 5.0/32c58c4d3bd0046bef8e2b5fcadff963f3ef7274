coresight: etf: Release CLAIM tag after disabling the HW

This patch rectifies the sequence of events in function
tmc_etb_disable_hw() by disabling the HW first and then releasing the
CLAIM tag.  Otherwise we could be corrupting the configuration done by an
external agent that would have claimed the device after we have released
it.
