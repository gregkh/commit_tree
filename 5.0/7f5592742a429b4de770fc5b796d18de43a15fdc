HID: input: support Microsoft wireless radio control hotkey

The ASUS laptops start to support the airplane mode radio management
to replace the original mechanism of airplane mode toggle hotkey.
On the ASUS P5440FF, it presents as a HID device connecting via
I2C, named i2c-AMPD0001. When pressing it, the Embedded Controller
send hid report via I2C and switch the airplane mode indicator LED
based on the status.

However, it's not working because it fails to be identified as a
hidinput device. It fails in hidinput_connect() due to the macro
IS_INPUT_APPLICATION doesn't have HID_GD_WIRELESS_RADIO_CTLS as
a legit application code.

It's easy to add the HID I2C vendor and product id to the quirk
list and apply HID_QUIRK_HIDINPUT_FORCE to make it work. But it
makes more sense to support it as a generic input application.
