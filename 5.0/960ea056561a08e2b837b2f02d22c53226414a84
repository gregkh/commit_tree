bpf: verifier: teach the verifier to reason about the BPF_JSET instruction

Some JITs (nfp) try to optimize code on their own.  It could make
sense in case of BPF_JSET instruction which is currently not interpreted
by the verifier, meaning for instance that dead could would not be
detected if it was under BPF_JSET branch.

Teach the verifier basics of BPF_JSET, JIT optimizations will be
removed shortly.
