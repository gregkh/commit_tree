kref/kobject: Improve documentation

The current kref and kobject documentation may be
insufficient to understand these common pitfalls regarding
object lifetime and object releasing.

Add a bit more documentation and improve the warnings
seen by the user, pointing to the right piece of documentation.

Also, it's important to understand that making fun of people
publicly is not at all helpful, doesn't provide any value,
and it's not a healthy way of encouraging developers to do better.

"Mocking mercilessly" will, if anything, make developers feel bad
and go away. This kind of behavior should not be encouraged or justified.
