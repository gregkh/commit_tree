ipv6: Consider sk_bound_dev_if when binding a socket to a v4 mapped address

Similar to c5ee066333eb ("ipv6: Consider sk_bound_dev_if when binding a
socket to an address"), binding a socket to v4 mapped addresses needs to
consider if the socket is bound to a device.

This problem also exists from the beginning of git history.
