arm64: add pointer authentication register bits

The ARMv8.3 pointer authentication extension adds:

* New fields in ID_AA64ISAR1 to report the presence of pointer
  authentication functionality.

* New control bits in SCTLR_ELx to enable this functionality.

* New system registers to hold the keys necessary for this
  functionality.

* A new ESR_ELx.EC code used when the new instructions are affected by
  configurable traps

This patch adds the relevant definitions to <asm/sysreg.h> and
<asm/esr.h> for these, to be used by subsequent patches.
