virtio-balloon: tweak config_changed implementation

virtio-ccw has deadlock issues with reading the config space inside the
interrupt context, so we tweak the virtballoon_changed implementation
by moving the config read operations into the related workqueue contexts.
The config_read_bitmap is used as a flag to the workqueue callbacks
about the related config fields that need to be read.

The cmd_id_received is also renamed to cmd_id_received_cache, and
the value should be obtained via virtio_balloon_cmd_id_received.
