drm/i915: Only reset seqno if actually idle

Before we can reset the seqno, we have to be sure the engines are idle.
In debugfs/i915_drop_caches_set, we do wait_for_idle but allow ourselves
to be interrupted. We should only proceed to reset the seqno then if we
were not interrupted, and so also avoid overwriting the error status.
