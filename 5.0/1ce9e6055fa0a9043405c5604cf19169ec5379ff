virtio_ring: introduce packed ring support

Introduce the packed ring support. Packed ring can only be
created by vring_create_virtqueue() and each chunk of packed
ring will be allocated individually. Packed ring can not be
created on preallocated memory by vring_new_virtqueue() or
the likes currently.
