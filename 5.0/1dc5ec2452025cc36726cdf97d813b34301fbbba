scsi: lpfc: add Trunking support

Add trunking support to the driver. Trunking is found on more recent
asics. In general, trunking appears as a single "port" to the driver
and overall behavior doesn't differ. Link speed is reported as an
aggregate value, while link speed control is done on a per-physical
link basis with all links in the trunk symmetrical. Some commands
returning port information are updated to additionally provide
trunking information. And new ACQEs are generated to report physical
link events relative to the trunk.

This patch contains the following modifications:

- Added link speed settings of 128GB and 256GB.

- Added handling of trunk-related ACQEs, mainly logging and trapping
  of physical link statuses.

- Added additional bsg interface to query trunk state by applications.

- Augment link_state sysfs attribtute to display trunk link status
