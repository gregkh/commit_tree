btrfs: Remove special handling of EXTENT_BUFFER_UNMAPPED while freeing

Now that the whole of btrfs code has been audited for eb reference count
management it's time to remove the hunk in free_extent_buffer that
essentially considered the condition

  "eb->ref == 2 && EXTENT_BUFFER_DUMMY"

to equal "eb->ref = 1". Also remove the last location
which takes an extra reference count in alloc_test_extent_buffer.
