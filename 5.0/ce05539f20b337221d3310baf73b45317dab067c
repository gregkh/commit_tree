perf trace: Show NULL when syscall pointer args are 0

Matching strace's output format. The 'format' file for the syscall
tracepoints have an indication if the arg is a pointer, with some
exceptions like 'mmap' that has its first arg as an 'unsigned long', so
use a heuristic using the argument name, i.e. if it contains the 'addr'
substring, format it with the pointer formatter.
