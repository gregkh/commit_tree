i2c: sh_mobile: add support for r8a77990 (R-Car E3)

Add support for the IIC code for the r8a77990 (R-Car E3).

It is not considered compatible with existing fallback bindings
due to the documented absence of automatic transmission registers.

These registers are currently not used by the driver and
thus the provides the same behaviour for "renesas,iic-r8a77990" and
"renesas,rcar-gen3-iic". The point of declaring incompatibility is
to allow for automatic transmission register support to be added to
"renesas,iic-r8a77990" and "renesas,rcar-gen3-iic" in future.
