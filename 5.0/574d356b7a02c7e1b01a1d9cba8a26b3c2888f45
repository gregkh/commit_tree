9p/net: put a lower bound on msize

If the requested msize is too small (either from command line argument
or from the server version reply), we won't get any work done.
If it's *really* too small, nothing will work, and this got caught by
syzbot recently (on a new kmem_cache_create_usercopy() call)

Just set a minimum msize to 4k in both code paths, until someone
complains they have a use-case for a smaller msize.

We need to check in both mount option and server reply individually
because the msize for the first version request would be unchecked
with just a global check on clnt->msize.
