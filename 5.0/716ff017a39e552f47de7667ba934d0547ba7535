KVM: x86: Allow Qemu/KVM to use PVH entry point

For certain applications it is desirable to rapidly boot a KVM virtual
machine. In cases where legacy hardware and software support within the
guest is not needed, Qemu should be able to boot directly into the
uncompressed Linux kernel binary without the need to run firmware.

There already exists an ABI to allow this for Xen PVH guests and the ABI
is supported by Linux and FreeBSD:

This patch enables Qemu to use that same entry point for booting KVM
guests.
