crypto: arm64/chacha20 - add XChaCha20 support

Add an XChaCha20 implementation that is hooked up to the ARM64 NEON
implementation of ChaCha20.  This can be used by Adiantum.

A NEON implementation of single-block HChaCha20 is also added so that
XChaCha20 can use it rather than the generic implementation.  This
required refactoring the ChaCha20 permutation into its own function.
