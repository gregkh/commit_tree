mtd: Make sure mtd->erasesize is valid even if the partition is of size 0

Commit 33f45c44d68b ("mtd: Do not allow MTD devices with inconsistent
erase properties") introduced a check to make sure ->erasesize and
->_erase values are consistent with the MTD_NO_ERASE flag.
This patch did not take the 0 bytes partition case into account which
can happen when the defined partition is outside the flash device memory
range. Fix that by setting the partition erasesize to the parent
erasesize.
