drm: Add vrr_enabled property to drm CRTC

This patch introduces the 'vrr_enabled' CRTC property to allow
dynamic control over variable refresh rate support for a CRTC.

This property should be treated like a content hint to the driver -
if the hardware or driver is not capable of driving variable refresh
timings then this is not considered an error.

Capability for variable refresh rate support should be determined
by querying the vrr_capable drm connector property.

It is worth noting that while the property is intended for atomic use
it isn't filtered from legacy userspace queries. This allows for Xorg
userspace drivers to implement support.
