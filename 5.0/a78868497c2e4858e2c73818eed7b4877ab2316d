xprtrdma: Reduce max_frwr_depth

Some devices advertise a large max_fast_reg_page_list_len
capability, but perform optimally when MRs are significantly smaller
than that depth -- probably when the MR itself is no larger than a
page.

By default, the RDMA R/W core API uses max_sge_rd as the maximum
page depth for MRs. For some devices, the value of max_sge_rd is
1, which is also not optimal. Thus, when max_sge_rd is larger than
1, use that value. Otherwise use the value of the
max_fast_reg_page_list_len attribute.

I've tested this with CX-3 Pro, FastLinq, and CX-5 devices. It
reproducibly improves the throughput of large I/Os by several
percent.
