arm64: KVM: Add trapped system register access tracepoint

We're pretty blind when it comes to system register tracing,
and rely on the ESR value displayed by kvm_handle_sys, which
isn't much.

Instead, let's add an actual name to the sysreg entries, so that
we can finally print it as we're about to perform the access
itself.

The new tracepoint is conveniently called kvm_sys_access.
