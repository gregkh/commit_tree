phy: fix build breakage: add PHY_MODE_SATA

Commit 49e54187ae0b ("ata: libahci_platform: comply to PHY framework") uses
the PHY_MODE_SATA, but that enum had not yet been added. This caused a
build failure for me, with today's linux.git.

Also, there is a potentially conflicting (mis-named) PHY_MODE_SATA, hiding
in the Marvell Berlin SATA PHY driver.

Fix the build by:

    1) Renaming Marvell's defined value to a more scoped name,
       in order to avoid any potential conflicts: PHY_BERLIN_MODE_SATA.

    2) Adding the missing enum, which was going to be added anyway as part
       of [1].
