arm64: capabilities: Merge entries for ARM64_WORKAROUND_CLEAN_CACHE

We have two entries for ARM64_WORKAROUND_CLEAN_CACHE capability :

1) ARM Errata 826319, 827319, 824069, 819472 on A53 r0p[012]
2) ARM Errata 819472 on A53 r0p[01]

Both have the same work around. Merge these entries to avoid
duplicate entries for a single capability. Add a new Kconfig
entry to control the "capability" entry to make it easier
to handle combinations of the CONFIGs.
