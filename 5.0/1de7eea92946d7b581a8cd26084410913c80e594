SUNRPC: add side channel to use non-generic cred for rpc call.

The credential passed in rpc_message.rpc_cred is always a
generic credential except in one instance.
When gss_destroying_context() calls rpc_call_null(), it passes
a specific credential that it needs to destroy.
In this case the RPC acts *on* the credential rather than
being authorized by it.

This special case deserves explicit support and providing that will
mean that rpc_message.rpc_cred is *always* generic, allowing
some optimizations.

So add "tk_op_cred" to rpc_task and "rpc_op_cred" to the setup data.
Use this to pass the cred down from rpc_call_null(), and have
rpcauth_bindcred() notice it and bind it in place.
