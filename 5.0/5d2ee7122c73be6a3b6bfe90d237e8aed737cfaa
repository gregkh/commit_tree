sbitmap: optimize wakeup check

Even if we have no waiters on any of the sbitmap_queue wait states, we
still have to loop every entry to check. We do this for every IO, so
the cost adds up.

Shift a bit of the cost to the slow path, when we actually have waiters.
Wrap prepare_to_wait_exclusive() and finish_wait(), so we can maintain
an internal count of how many are currently active. Then we can simply
check this count in sbq_wake_ptr() and not have to loop if we don't
have any sleepers.

Convert the two users of sbitmap with waiting, blk-mq-tag and iSCSI.
