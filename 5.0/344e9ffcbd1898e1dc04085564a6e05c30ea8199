block: add queue_is_mq() helper

Various spots check for q->mq_ops being non-NULL, but provide
a helper to do this instead.

Where the ->mq_ops != NULL check is redundant, remove it.

Since mq == rq-based now that legacy is gone, get rid of the
queue_is_rq_based() and just use queue_is_mq() everywhere.
