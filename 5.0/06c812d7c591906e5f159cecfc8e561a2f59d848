drm/i915: Add AVI infoframe support for LSPCON

In order to pass AVI infoframes to LSPCON devices, a source has to
write them in a vendor recommended method and location.

This patch series:
- adds generic LSPCON infoframe setup functions.
- registers these functions into existing AVI infoframe framework.
- triggers these functions from modeset sequence.

Next patches in the series will add vendor specific code.

V2: Added new parameter to align with new definition of
    drm_hdmi_avi_infoframe_quant_range
V3: Added r-b from Maarten (for V2)
    Added new parameter output_format in struct lspcon to accommodate
    Ville's review comments on last patch of the series
V4: Addressed Ville's review comment
    - Do not add output_format in LSPCON state, as its non-atomic. Add
      this into CRTC state (added in a later patch).
V5: Rebase
V6: Rebase
V7: Rebase
V8: Rebase
V9: Rebase
V10: Rebase
V11: Accommodated rebasing changes in intel_git_port fptrs (set_infoframes and infoframe_enabled)
