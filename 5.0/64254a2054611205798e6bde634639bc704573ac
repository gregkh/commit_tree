mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Do not treat static FDB entries as sticky

The driver currently treats static FDB entries as both static and
sticky. This is incorrect and prevents such entries from being roamed to
a different port via learning.

Fix this by configuring static entries with ageing disabled and roaming
enabled.

In net-next we can add proper support for the newly introduced 'sticky'
flag.
