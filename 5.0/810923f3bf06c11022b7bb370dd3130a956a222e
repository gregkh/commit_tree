spi: Deal with slaves that return from transfer_one() unfinished

Some drivers, such as spi-pxa2xx return from the transfer_one callback
immediately, idicating that the transfer will be finished asynchronously.

Normally, spi_transfer_one_message() synchronously waits for the
transfer to finish with wait_for_completion_timeout(). For slaves, we
don't want the transaction to time out as it can complete in a long time
in future. Use wait_for_completion_interruptible() instead.
