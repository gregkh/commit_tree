scsi: megaraid_sas_fusion: Mark expected switch fall-through

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases where
we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that, in this particular case, I replaced "Fall thru" with a "Fall
through" annotation and added a dash as a token in order to separate the
"Fall through" annotation from the rest of the comment on the same line,
which is what GCC is expecting to find.
