net: phy: remove useless check in state machine case PHY_RESUMING

If aneg isn't finished yet then the PHY reports the link as down.
There's no benefit in setting the state to PHY_AN because the next
state machine run would set the status to PHY_NOLINK anyway (except
in the meantime aneg has been finished and link is up). Therefore
we can set the state to PHY_RUNNING or PHY_NOLINK directly.

In addition change the do_carrier parameter in phy_link_down() to true.
If carrier was marked as up before (what should never be the case because
PHY was in state PHY_HALTED before) then we should mark it as down now.
