Revert "drm/amdgpu: use GMC v9 KIQ workaround only for the GFXHUB" (v2)

With GFXOFF enabled, this patch will cause PCO amdgpu_test failed,
but GFXOFF is necessary for PCO, so revert the patch.

This reverts commit b83761bb0b09ec11c924afe9d88e458cb16a0372.

v2: add a comment for future reference (Alex)
