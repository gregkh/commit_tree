lockd: fix decoding of TEST results

We fail to advance the read pointer when reading the stat.oh field that
identifies the lock-holder in a TEST result.

This turns out not to matter if the server is knfsd, which always
returns a zero-length field.  But other servers (Ganesha is an example)
may not do this.  The result is bad values in fcntl F_GETLK results.

Fix this.
