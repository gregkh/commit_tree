tpm2: add new tpm2 commands according to TCG 1.36

1. TPM2_CC_LAST has moved from 182 to 193
2. Convert tpm2_ordinal_duration from an array into a switch statement,
   as there are not so many commands that require special duration
   relative to a number of commands, the switch statement function
   is called tpm2_ordinal_duration_index().
3. Fix kdoc comments for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration().
