mmc: meson-gx: fix interrupt name

Commit bb364890323cca ("mmc: meson-gx: Free irq in release() callback")
changed the _probe code to use request_threaded_irq() instead of
devm_request_threaded_irq().
Unfortunately this removes a fallback for the interrupt name:
devm_request_threaded_irq() uses the device name as fallback if the
given IRQ name is NULL. request_threaded_irq() has no such fallback,
thus /proc/interrupts shows "(null)" instead.

Explicitly pass the dev_name() so we get the IRQ name shown in
/proc/interrupts again.
While here, also fix the indentation of the request_threaded_irq()
parameter list.
