net/mlx5e: Fail attempt to offload e-switch TC flows with egress upper devices

We use the switchdev parent HW id helper to identify if the mirred device
shares the same ASIC/port with the ingress device. This can get us wrong
in the presence of upper devices such as vlan or bridge set over the HW
devices (VF or uplink representors), b/c the switchdev ID is retrieved
recursively.

To fail offload attempts in such cases, we condition the check on the
egress device to have not only the same switchdev ID but also the relevant
mlx5 netdev ops.
