zram: writeback throttle

If there are lots of write IO with flash device, it could have a
wearout problem of storage. To overcome the problem, admin needs
to design write limitation to guarantee flash health
for entire product life.

This patch creates a new knob "writeback_limit" for zram.

writeback_limit's default value is 0 so that it doesn't limit
any writeback. If admin want to measure writeback count in a
certain period, he could know it via /sys/block/zram0/bd_stat's
3rd column.

If admin want to limit writeback as per-day 400M, he could do it
like below.

	MB_SHIFT=20
	4K_SHIFT=12
	echo $((400<<MB_SHIFT>>4K_SHIFT)) > \
		/sys/block/zram0/writeback_limit.

If admin want to allow further write again, he could do it like below

	echo 0 > /sys/block/zram0/writeback_limit

If admin want to see remaining writeback budget,

	cat /sys/block/zram0/writeback_limit

The writeback_limit count will reset whenever you reset zram (e.g., system
reboot, echo 1 > /sys/block/zramX/reset) so keeping how many of writeback
happened until you reset the zram to allocate extra writeback budget in
next setting is user's job.
