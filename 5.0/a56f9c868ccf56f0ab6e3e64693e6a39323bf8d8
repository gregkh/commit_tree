drm/virtio: add uapi for in and out explicit fences

Add a new field called fence_fd that will be used by userspace to send
in-fences to the kernel and receive out-fences created by the kernel.

This uapi enables virtio to take advantage of explicit synchronization of
dma-bufs.

There are two new flags:

* VIRTGPU_EXECBUF_FENCE_FD_IN to be used when passing an in-fence fd.
* VIRTGPU_EXECBUF_FENCE_FD_OUT to be used when requesting an out-fence fd

The execbuffer IOCTL is now read-write to allow the userspace to read the
out-fence.

On error -1 should be returned in the fence_fd field.
