Powerpc/perf: Wire up PMI throttling

Commit 14c63f17b1fde ("perf: Drop sample rate when sampling is too
slow") introduced a way to throttle PMU interrupts if we're spending
too much time just processing those. Wire up powerpc PMI handler to
use this infrastructure.

We have throttling of the *rate* of interrupts, but this adds
throttling based on the *time taken* to process the interrupts.
