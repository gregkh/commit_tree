xen/pvh: Split CONFIG_XEN_PVH into CONFIG_PVH and CONFIG_XEN_PVH

In order to pave the way for hypervisors other than Xen to use the PVH
entry point for VMs, we need to factor the PVH entry code into Xen specific
and hypervisor agnostic components. The first step in doing that, is to
create a new config option for PVH entry that can be enabled
independently from CONFIG_XEN.
