ARM/arm64: dts: allwinner: Move H3/H5 syscon label over to soc-specific nodes

The EMAC driver requires a syscon node to access the EMAC clock
configuration register (that is part of the system-control register
range and controlled). For this purpose, a dummy syscon node was
introduced to let the driver access the register freely.

Recently, the EMAC driver was tuned to get access to the register when
the SRAM driver is registered (as used on the A64). As a result, it is
no longer necessary to have a dummy syscon node for that purpose.

Now that we have a proper system-control node for both the H3 and H5,
we can get rid of that dummy syscon node and have the EMAC driver use
the node corresponding to the proper SRAM driver (by switching the
syscon label over to each dtsi). This way, we no longer have two
separate nodes for the same register space.
