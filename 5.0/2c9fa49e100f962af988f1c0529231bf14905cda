scsi: target/core: Make ABORT and LUN RESET handling synchronous

Instead of invoking target driver callback functions from the context that
handles an abort or LUN RESET task management function, only set the abort
flag from that context and perform the actual abort handling from the
context of the regular command processing flow. This approach has the
advantage that the task management code becomes much easier to read and to
verify since the number of potential race conditions against the command
processing flow is strongly reduced.

This patch has been tested by running the following two shell commands
concurrently for about ten minutes for both the iSCSI and the SRP target
drivers ($dev is an initiator device node connected with storage provided
by the target driver under test):

 * fio with data verification enabled on a filesystem mounted on top of
   $dev.

 * while true; do sg_reset -d $dev; echo -n .; sleep .1; done
