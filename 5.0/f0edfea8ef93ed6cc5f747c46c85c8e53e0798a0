dma-mapping: move the remap helpers to a separate file

The dma remap code only makes sense for not cache coherent architectures
(or possibly the corner case of highmem CMA allocations) and currently
is only used by arm, arm64, csky and xtensa.  Split it out into a
separate file with a separate Kconfig symbol, which gets the right
copyright notice given that this code was written by Laura Abbott
working for Code Aurora at that point.
