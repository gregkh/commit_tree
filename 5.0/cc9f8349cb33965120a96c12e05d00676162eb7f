arm64: crypto: add NEON accelerated XOR implementation

This is a NEON acceleration method that can improve
performance by approximately 20%. I got the following
data from the centos 7.5 on Huawei's HISI1616 chip:

[ 93.837726] xor: measuring software checksum speed
[ 93.874039]   8regs  : 7123.200 MB/sec
[ 93.914038]   32regs : 7180.300 MB/sec
[ 93.954043]   arm64_neon: 9856.000 MB/sec
[ 93.954047] xor: using function: arm64_neon (9856.000 MB/sec)

I believe this code can bring some optimization for
all arm64 platform. thanks for Ard Biesheuvel's suggestions.
