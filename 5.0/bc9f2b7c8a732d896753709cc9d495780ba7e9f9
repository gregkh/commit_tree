xfs: idiotproof defer op type configuration

Recently, we forgot to port a new defer op type to xfsprogs, which
caused us some userspace pain.  Reorganize the way we make libxfs
clients supply defer op type information so that all type information
has to be provided at build time instead of risky runtime dynamic
configuration.
