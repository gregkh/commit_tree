spi: imx: rename config callback and add useful parameters

The config callback is called once per transfer while some things can (and
should) be done on a per message manner. To have unambiguous naming in the
end include "transfer" in the callback's name and rename the
implementations accordingly. Also pass the driver struct and transfer
which allows further simplifications in the following patch.

There is no change in behavior intended here.
