x86/mm/mem_encrypt: Fix erroneous sizeof()

Using sizeof(pointer) for determining the size of a memset() only works
when the size of the pointer and the size of type to which it points are
the same. For pte_t this is only true for 64bit and 32bit-NONPAE. On 32bit
PAE systems this is wrong as the pointer size is 4 byte but the PTE entry
is 8 bytes. It's actually not a real world issue as this code depends on
64bit, but it's wrong nevertheless.

Use sizeof(*p) for correctness sake.
