bpf: fix panic in stack_map_get_build_id() on i386 and arm32

As Naresh reported, test_stacktrace_build_id() causes panic on i386 and
arm32 systems. This is caused by page_address() returns NULL in certain
cases.

This patch fixes this error by using kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic instead
of page_address.
