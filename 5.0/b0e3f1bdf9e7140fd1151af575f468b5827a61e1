net: Add trace events for all receive exit points

Trace events are already present for the receive entry points, to indicate
how the reception entered the stack.

This patch adds the corresponding exit trace events that will bound the
reception such that all events occurring between the entry and the exit
can be considered as part of the reception context. This greatly helps
for dependency and root cause analyses.

Without this, it is not possible with tracepoint instrumentation to
determine whether a sched_wakeup event following a netif_receive_skb
event is the result of the packet reception or a simple coincidence after
further processing by the thread. It is possible using other mechanisms
like kretprobes, but considering the "entry" points are already present,
it would be good to add the matching exit events.

In addition to linking packets with wakeups, the entry/exit event pair
can also be used to perform network stack latency analyses.
