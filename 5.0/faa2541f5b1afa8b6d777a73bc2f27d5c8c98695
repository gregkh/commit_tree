leds: trigger: Introduce audio mute LED trigger

This patch adds a new LED trigger for coupling the audio mixer change
with the LED on laptops or other devices.  Currently there are two
trigger types, "audio-mute" and "audio-micmute".

The audio driver triggers the LED brightness change via
ledtrig_audio_set() call with the proper type (either mute or
mic-mute).  OTOH, the consumers may call ledtrig_audio_get() for the
initial brightness value that may have been set by the audio driver
beforehand.

This new stuff will be used by HD-audio codec driver and some platform
drivers (thinkpad_acpi and dell-laptop, also upcoming huawei-wmi).
