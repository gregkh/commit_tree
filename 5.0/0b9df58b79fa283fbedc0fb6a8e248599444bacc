xxHash: create arch dependent 32/64-bit xxhash()

Patch series "Currently used jhash are slow enough and replace it allow as
to make KSM", v8.

Apeed (in kernel):
        ksm: crc32c   hash() 12081 MB/s
        ksm: xxh64    hash()  8770 MB/s
        ksm: xxh32    hash()  4529 MB/s
        ksm: jhash2   hash()  1569 MB/s

Sioh Lee's testing (copy from other mail):

Test platform: openstack cloud platform (NEWTON version)
Experiment node: openstack based cloud compute node (CPU: xeon E5-2620 v3, memory 64gb)
VM: (2 VCPU, RAM 4GB, DISK 20GB) * 4
Linux kernel: 4.14 (latest version)
KSM setup - sleep_millisecs: 200ms, pages_to_scan: 200

Experiment process:
Firstly, we turn off KSM and launch 4 VMs.  Then we turn on the KSM and
measure the checksum computation time until full_scans become two.

The experimental results (the experimental value is the average of the measured values)
crc32c_intel: 1084.10ns
crc32c (no hardware acceleration): 7012.51ns
xxhash32: 2227.75ns
xxhash64: 1413.16ns
jhash2: 5128.30ns

In summary, the result shows that crc32c_intel has advantages over all of
the hash function used in the experiment.  (decreased by 84.54% compared
to crc32c, 78.86% compared to jhash2, 51.33% xxhash32, 23.28% compared to
xxhash64) the results are similar to those of Timofey.

But, use only xxhash for now, because for using crc32c, cryptoapi must be
initialized first - that require some tricky solution to work good in all
situations.

So:

- First patch implement compile time pickup of fastest implementation of
  xxhash for target platform.

- The second patch replaces jhash2 with xxhash

This patch (of 2):

xxh32() - fast on both 32/64-bit platforms
xxh64() - fast only on 64-bit platform

Create xxhash() which will pick up the fastest version at compile time.
