scsi: zfcp: fix sysfs block queue limit output for max_segment_size

Since v2.6.35 commit 683229845f17 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Report scatter-gather
limits to SCSI and block layer"), zfcp set dma_parms.max_segment_size ==
PAGE_SIZE (but without using the setter dma_set_max_seg_size()) and
scsi_host_template.dma_boundary == PAGE_SIZE - 1.

v5.0-rc1 commit 50c2e9107f17 ("scsi: introduce a max_segment_size
host_template parameters") introduced a new field
scsi_host_template.max_segment_size. If an LLDD such as zfcp does not set
it, scsi_host_alloc() uses BLK_MAX_SEGMENT_SIZE = 65536 for
Scsi_Host.max_segment_size. __scsi_init_queue() announced the minimum of
Scsi_Host.max_segment_size and dma_parms.max_segment_size to the block
layer. For zfcp: min(65536, 4096) == 4096 which was still good.

v5.0 commit a8cf59a6692c ("scsi: communicate max segment size to the DMA
mapping code") announces Scsi_Host.max_segment_size to the block layer and
overwrites dma_parms.max_segment_size with Scsi_Host.max_segment_size.  For
zfcp dma_parms.max_segment_size == Scsi_Host.max_segment_size == 65536
which is also reflected in block queue limits.

$ cd /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp
$ cd 0.0.3c40/host5/rport-5:0-4/target5:0:4/5:0:4:10/block/sdi/queue
$ cat max_segment_size
65536

Zfcp I/O still works because dma_boundary implicitly still keeps the
effective max segment size <= PAGE_SIZE.  However, dma_boundary does not
seem visible to user space, but max_segment_size is visible and shows a
misleading wrong value.  Fix it and inherit the stable tag of a8cf59a6692c.

Devices on our bus ccw support DMA but no DMA mapping. Of multiple device
types on the ccw bus, only zfcp needs dma_parms for SCSI limits.  So, leave
dma_parms setup in zfcp and do not move it to the bus.
