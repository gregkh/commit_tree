drm/fb-helper: Partially bring back workaround for bugs of SDL 1.2

SDL 1.2 sets all fields related to the pixel format to zero in some
cases[1]. Prior to commit db05c48197759 ("drm: fb-helper: Reject all
pixel format changing requests"), there was an unintentional workaround
for this that existed for more than a decade. First in device-specific DRM
drivers, then here in drm_fb_helper.c.

Previous code containing this workaround just ignores pixel format fields
from userspace code. Not a good thing either, as this way, driver may
silently use pixel format different from what client actually requested,
and this in turn will lead to displaying garbage on the screen. I think
that returning EINVAL to userspace in this particular case is the right
option, so I decided to left code from problematic commit untouched
instead of just reverting it entirely.

Here is the steps required to reproduce this problem exactly:
	1) Compile fceux[2] with SDL 1.2.15 and without GTK or OpenGL
	   support. SDL should be compiled with fbdev support (which is
	   on by default).
	2) Create /etc/fb.modes with following contents (values seems
	   not used, and just required to trigger problematic code in
	   SDL):

		mode "test"
		    geometry 1 1 1 1 1
		    timings 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
		endmode

	3) Create ~/.fceux/fceux.cfg with following contents:

		SDL.Hotkeys.Quit = 27
		SDL.DoubleBuffering = 1

	4) Ensure that screen resolution is at least 1280x960 (e.g.
	   append "video=Virtual-1:1280x960-32" to the kernel cmdline
	   for qemu/QXL).

	5) Try to run fceux on VT with some ROM file[3]:

		# ./fceux color_test.nes
