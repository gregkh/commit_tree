rtnetlink: remove a level of indentation in rtnl_newlink()

rtnl_newlink() used to create VLAs based on link kind.  Since
commit ccf8dbcd062a ("rtnetlink: Remove VLA usage") statically
sized array is created on the stack, so there is no more use
for a separate code block that used to be the VLA's live range.

While at it christmas tree the variables.  Note that there is
a goto-based retry so to be on the safe side the variables can
no longer be initialized in place.  It doesn't seem to matter,
logically, but why make the code harder to read..
