spi: uniphier: fix incorrect property items

This commit fixes incorrect property because it was different
from the actual.
The parameters of '#address-cells' and '#size-cells' were removed,
and 'interrupts', 'pinctrl-names' and 'pinctrl-0' were added.

Fixes: 4dcd5c2781f3 ("spi: add DT bindings for UniPhier SPI controller")
