cred: add cred_fscmp() for comparing creds.

NFS needs to compare to credentials, to see if they can
be treated the same w.r.t. filesystem access.  Sometimes
an ordering is needed when credentials are used as a key
to an rbtree.
NFS currently has its own private credential management from
before 'struct cred' existed.  To move it over to more consistent
use of 'struct cred' we need a comparison function.
This patch adds that function.
