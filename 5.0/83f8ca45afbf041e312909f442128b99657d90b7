PM / devfreq: add support for suspend/resume of a devfreq device

The patch prepares devfreq device for handling suspend/resume
functionality. The new fields will store needed information during this
process. Devfreq framework handles opp-suspend DT entry and there is no
need of modyfications in the drivers code. It uses atomic variables to
make sure no race condition affects the process.
