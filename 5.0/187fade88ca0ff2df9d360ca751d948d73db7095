fpga: altera-cvp: fix 'bad IO access' on x86_64

If mapping the CvP BAR fails, we still can configure the FPGA via
PCI config space access. In this case the iomap pointer is NULL.
On x86_64, passing NULL address to pci_iounmap() generates
"Bad IO access at port 0x0" output with stack call trace. Fix it.
