arm64: KVM: Add synchronization on translation regime change for erratum 1165522

In order to ensure that slipping HCR_EL2.TGE is done at the right
time when switching translation regime, let insert the required ISBs
that will be patched in when erratum 1165522 is detected.

Take this opportunity to add the missing include of asm/alternative.h
which was getting there by pure luck.
