scsi: target/core: Simplify transport_clear_lun_ref()

Since transport_clear_lun_ref() already waits until the percpu-refcount
.release() method is called, it is not necessary to wait first until
percpu_ref_kill_and_confirm() has finished transitioning the refcount into
atomic mode. Remove the code that waits for percpu_ref_kill_and_confirm()
to complete and also the completion object that is used by that code.  This
patch does not change the behavior of the SCSI target code.
