kvm: x86/vmx: Use kzalloc for cached_vmcs12

This changes the allocation of cached_vmcs12 to use kzalloc instead of
kmalloc. This removes the information leak found by Syzkaller (see
Reported-by) in this case and prevents similar leaks from happening
based on cached_vmcs12.

It also changes vmx_get_nested_state to copy out the full 4k VMCS12_SIZE
in copy_to_user rather than only the size of the struct.

Tested: rebuilt against head, booted, and ran the syszkaller repro
  https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproC&x=174efca3400000 without
  observing any problems.
