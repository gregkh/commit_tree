drm/amd/display: fbc state could not reach while enable fbc

   [WHY] fbc is within the data path from memory to dce. while
   re-configure mc dmif, fbc should be enabled. otherwise, fbc
   may not be enabled properly.

   [HOW] before re-configure mc dmif, disable fbc, only after
   dmif re-configuration fully done, enable fbc again.
