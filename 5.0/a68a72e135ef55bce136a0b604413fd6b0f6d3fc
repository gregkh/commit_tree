SUNRPC: introduce RPC_TASK_NULLCREDS to request auth_none

In almost all cases the credential stored in rpc_message.rpc_cred
is a "generic" credential.  One of the two expections is when an
AUTH_NULL credential is used such as for RPC ping requests.

To improve consistency, don't pass an explicit credential in
these cases, but instead pass NULL and set a task flag,
similar to RPC_TASK_ROOTCREDS, which requests that NULL credentials
be used by default.
