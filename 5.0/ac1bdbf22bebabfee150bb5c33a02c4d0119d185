gpu: host1x: Add Tegra194 support

The host1x hardware found on Tegra194 is mostly backwards compatible
with the version found on Tegra186, with the notable exceptions of the
increased number of syncpoints and mlocks. In addition, some rarely
used features such as syncpoint wait bases were dropped and some
registers had to move around to accomodate the increased number of
syncpoints.
