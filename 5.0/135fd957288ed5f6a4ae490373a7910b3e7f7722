mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Update Bloom filter on eRP transitions

Bloom filter update is required only for rules which reside on an
eRP. When the region has only a single rule pattern then eRP table
is not used, however insertion of another pattern would trigger a
move to an active eRP table so it is imperative to update the Bloom
filter with all previously configured rules.

Add a method that updates Bloom filter entries for all rules
currently configured in the region, on the event of a transition
from master mask to eRP, or vice versa. For that purpose, maintain
a list of all A-TCAM rules within mlxsw_sp_acl_atcam_region.
