ftrace: Create new ftrace_internal.h header

In order to move function graph infrastructure into its own file (fgraph.h)
it needs to access various functions and variables in ftrace.c that are
currently static. Create a new file called ftrace-internal.h that holds the
function prototypes and the extern declarations of the variables needed by
fgraph.c as well, and make them global in ftrace.c such that they can be
used outside that file.
