netlabel: fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

There are two array out-of-bounds memory accesses, one in
cipso_v4_map_lvl_valid(), the other in netlbl_bitmap_walk().  Both
errors are embarassingly simple, and the fixes are straightforward.

As a FYI for anyone backporting this patch to kernels prior to v4.8,
you'll want to apply the netlbl_bitmap_walk() patch to
cipso_v4_bitmap_walk() as netlbl_bitmap_walk() doesn't exist before
Linux v4.8.
