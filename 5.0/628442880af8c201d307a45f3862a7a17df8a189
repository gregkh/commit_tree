Input: cap11xx - switch to using set_brightness_blocking()

Updating LED state requires access to regmap and therefore we may sleep,
so we could not do that directly form set_brightness() method.
Historically we used private work to adjust the brightness, but with the
introduction of set_brightness_blocking() we no longer need it.

As a bonus, not having our own work item means we do not have
use-after-free issue as we neglected to cancel outstanding work on
driver unbind.
