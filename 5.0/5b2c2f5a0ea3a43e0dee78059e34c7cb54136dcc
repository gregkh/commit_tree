of: overlay: add missing of_node_get() in __of_attach_node_sysfs

There is a matching of_node_put() in __of_detach_node_sysfs()

Remove misleading comment from function header comment for
of_detach_node().

This patch may result in memory leaks from code that directly calls
the dynamic node add and delete functions directly instead of
using changesets.

This commit should result in powerpc systems that dynamically
allocate a node, then later deallocate the node to have a
memory leak when the node is deallocated.

The next commit will fix the leak.
