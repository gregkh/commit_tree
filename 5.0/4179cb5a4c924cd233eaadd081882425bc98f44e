vxlan: test dev->flags & IFF_UP before calling netif_rx()

netif_rx() must be called under a strict contract.

At device dismantle phase, core networking clears IFF_UP
and flush_all_backlogs() is called after rcu grace period
to make sure no incoming packet might be in a cpu backlog
and still referencing the device.

Most drivers call netif_rx() from their interrupt handler,
and since the interrupts are disabled at device dismantle,
netif_rx() does not have to check dev->flags & IFF_UP

Virtual drivers do not have this guarantee, and must
therefore make the check themselves.

Otherwise we risk use-after-free and/or crashes.

Note this patch also fixes a small issue that came
with commit ce6502a8f957 ("vxlan: fix a use after free
in vxlan_encap_bypass"), since the dev->stats.rx_dropped
change was done on the wrong device.
