media: exynos4-is: convert g/s_crop to g/s_selection

Replace g/s_crop by g/s_selection and set the V4L2_FL_QUIRK_INVERTED_CROP
flag since this is one of the old drivers that predates the selection
API. Those old drivers allowed g_crop when it really shouldn't have since
g_crop returns a compose rectangle instead of a crop rectangle for the
CAPTURE stream, and vice versa for the OUTPUT stream.

Also drop the now unused vidioc_cropcap.
