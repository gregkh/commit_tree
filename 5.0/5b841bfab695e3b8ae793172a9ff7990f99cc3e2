smack: fix access permissions for keyring

Function smack_key_permission() only issues smack requests for the
following operations:
 - KEY_NEED_READ (issues MAY_READ)
 - KEY_NEED_WRITE (issues MAY_WRITE)
 - KEY_NEED_LINK (issues MAY_WRITE)
 - KEY_NEED_SETATTR (issues MAY_WRITE)
A blank smack request is issued in all other cases, resulting in
smack access being granted if there is any rule defined between
subject and object, or denied with -EACCES otherwise.

Request MAY_READ access for KEY_NEED_SEARCH and KEY_NEED_VIEW.
Fix the logic in the unlikely case when both MAY_READ and
MAY_WRITE are needed. Validate access permission field for valid
contents.
