scsi: target: use consistent left-aligned ASCII INQUIRY data

spc5r17.pdf specifies:

  4.3.1 ASCII data field requirements
  ASCII data fields shall contain only ASCII printable characters (i.e.,
  code values 20h to 7Eh) and may be terminated with one or more ASCII null
  (00h) characters.  ASCII data fields described as being left-aligned
  shall have any unused bytes at the end of the field (i.e., highest
  offset) and the unused bytes shall be filled with ASCII space characters
  (20h).

LIO currently space-pads the T10 VENDOR IDENTIFICATION and PRODUCT
IDENTIFICATION fields in the standard INQUIRY data. However, the PRODUCT
REVISION LEVEL field in the standard INQUIRY data as well as the T10 VENDOR
IDENTIFICATION field in the INQUIRY Device Identification VPD Page are
zero-terminated/zero-padded.

Fix this inconsistency by using space-padding for all of the above fields.
