genirq: Fix the kerneldoc comment for struct irq_affinity_desc

A recent commit added a new field but did not update the kerneldoc comment,
leading to this build warning:

  ./include/linux/interrupt.h:268: warning: Function parameter or member 'is_managed' not described in 'irq_affinity_desc'

Add the missing information, making the docs build 0.001% quieter.
