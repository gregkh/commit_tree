bnxt_en: Wait longer for the firmware message response to complete.

The code waits up to 20 usec for the firmware response to complete
once we've seen the valid response header in the buffer.  It turns
out that in some scenarios, this wait time is not long enough.
Extend it to 150 usec and use usleep_range() instead of udelay().
