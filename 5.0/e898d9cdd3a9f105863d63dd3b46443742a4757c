mailbox: Add device-managed registration functions

Add device-managed equivalents of the mbox_controller_register() and
mbox_controller_unregister() functions that can be used to have the
devres infrastructure automatically unregister mailbox controllers on
driver probe failure or driver removal. This can help remove a lot of
boiler plate code from drivers.
