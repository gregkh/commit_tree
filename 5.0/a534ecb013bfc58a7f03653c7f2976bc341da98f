NFSv4: add cl_root_cred for use when machine cred is not available.

NFSv4 state management tries a root credential when no machine
credential is available, as can happen with kerberos.
It does this by replacing the cl_machine_cred with a root credential.
This means that any user of the machine credential needs to take
a lock while getting a reference to the machine credential, which is
a little cumbersome.

So introduce an explicit cl_root_cred, and never free either
credential until client shutdown.  This means that no locking
is needed to reference these credentials.  Future patches
will make use of this.

This is only a temporary addition.  both cl_machine_cred and
cl_root_cred will disappear later in the series.
