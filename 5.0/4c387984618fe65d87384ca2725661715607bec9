ARM: dts: omap5: Add l4 interconnect hierarchy and ti-sysc data

Similar to commit 8f42cb7f64c7 ("ARM: dts: omap4: Add l4 interconnect
hierarchy and ti-sysc data"), let's add proper interconnect hierarchy
for l4 interconnect instances with the related ti-sysc interconnect
module data as in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/bus/ti-sysc.txt.

Using ti-sysc driver binding allows us to start dropping legacy platform
data in arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap*hwmod*data.c files later on in favor of
ti-sysc dts data.

This data is generated based on platform data from a booted system
and the interconnect acces protection registers for ranges. To avoid
regressions, we initially validate the device tree provided data
against the existing platform data on boot.
