scsi: lpfc: ls_rjt erroneus FLOGIs

In some link initialization sequences, the fw generates an erroneous FLOGI
payload to the driver without an intervening link bounce.  The driver, when
it sees a 2nd FLOGI without an intervening link bounce, automatically
performs a link bounce. In this, the link bounce causes the situate to
repeat and in a nasty loop of link bounces.

Resolve the issue by validating the FLOGI payload. The erroneous FLOGI will
contain VVL signatures that are not normal. When the driver sees these, it
will simply reject the flogi rather than bouncing the link.  The reject is
consumed within the firmware.
