drbd: fix confusing error message during attach

If we attach a (consistent) backing device,
which knows about a last-agreed effective size,
and that effective size is *larger* than the currently requested size,
we refused to attach with ERR_DISK_TOO_SMALL
  Failure: (111) Low.dev. smaller than requested DRBD-dev. size.
which is confusing to say the least.

This patch changes the error code in that case to ERR_IMPLICIT_SHRINK
  Failure: (170) Implicit device shrinking not allowed. See kernel log.
  additional info from kernel:
  To-be-attached device has last effective > current size, and is consistent
  (9999 > 7777 sectors). Refusing to attach.

It also allows to attach with an explicit size.
