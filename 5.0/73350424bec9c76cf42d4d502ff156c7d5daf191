cfg80211: pmsr: fix abort locking

When we destroy the interface we already hold the wdev->mtx
while calling cfg80211_pmsr_wdev_down(), which assumes this
isn't true and flushes the worker that takes the lock, thus
leading to a deadlock.

Fix this by refactoring the worker and calling its code in
cfg80211_pmsr_wdev_down() directly.

We still need to flush the work later to make sure it's not
still running and will crash, but it will not do anything.
