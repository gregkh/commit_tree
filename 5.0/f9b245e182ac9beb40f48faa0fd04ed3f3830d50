KVM: nVMX: Remove param indirection from nested_vmx_check_msr_switch()

Passing the enum and doing an indirect lookup is silly when we can
simply pass the field directly.  Remove the "fast path" code in
nested_vmx_check_msr_switch_controls() as it's now nothing more than a
redundant check.

Remove the debug message rather than continue passing the enum for the
address field.  Having debug messages for the MSRs themselves is useful
as MSR legality is a huge space, whereas messing up a physical address
means the VMM is fundamentally broken.
