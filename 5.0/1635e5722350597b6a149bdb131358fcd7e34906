audit: Make hash table insertion safe against concurrent lookups

Currently, the audit tree code does not make sure that when a chunk is
inserted into the hash table, it is fully initialized. So in theory a
user of RCU lookup could see uninitialized structure in the hash table
and crash. Add appropriate barriers between initialization of the
structure and its insertion into hash table.
