firmware: arm_scmi: provide the mandatory device release callback

The device/driver model clearly mandates that bus driver that discover
and allocate the device must set the release callback. This callback
will be used to free the device after all references have gone away.

scmi bus driver is missing the obvious callback which will result in
the following warning if the device is unregistered:

Device 'scmi_dev.1' does not have a release() function, it is broken and
must be fixed. See Documentation/kobject.txt.

Fix the issue by providing scmi_device_release callback. We have
everything required for device release already in scmi_device_destroy,
so we just need to move freeing of the device to scmi_device_release.
