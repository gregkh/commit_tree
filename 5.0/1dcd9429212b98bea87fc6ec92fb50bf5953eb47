mwifiex: fix potential NULL dereference and use after free

There are two defects: (1) passing a NULL bss to
mwifiex_save_hidden_ssid_channels will result in NULL dereference,
(2) using bss after dropping the reference to it via cfg80211_put_bss.
To fix them, the patch moves the buggy code to the branch that bss is
not NULL and puts it before cfg80211_put_bss.
