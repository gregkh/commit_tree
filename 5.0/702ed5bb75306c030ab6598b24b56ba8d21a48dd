include: pe.h: remove message[] from mz header definition

message[] field won't be part of the definition of mz header.

This change is crucial for enabling kexec_file_load on arm64 because
arm64's "Image" binary, as in PE format, doesn't have any data for it and
accordingly the following check in pefile_parse_binary() will fail:

	chkaddr(cursor, mz->peaddr, sizeof(*pe));
