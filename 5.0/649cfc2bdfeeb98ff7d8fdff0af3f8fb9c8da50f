media: coda: fix memory corruption in case more than 32 instances are opened

The ffz() return value is undefined if the instance mask does not
contain any zeros. If it returned 32, the following set_bit would
corrupt the debugfs_root pointer.
Switch to IDA for context index allocation. This also removes the
artificial 32 instance limit for all except CodaDx6.
