powerpc/powernv/ioda: Reduce a number of hooks in pnv_phb

fixup_phb() is never used, this removes it.

pick_m64_pe() and reserve_m64_pe() are always defined for all powernv
PHBs: they are initialized by pnv_ioda_parse_m64_window() which is
called unconditionally from pnv_pci_init_ioda_phb() which initializes
all known PHB types on powernv so we can open code them.
