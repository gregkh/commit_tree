afs: Set correct lock type for the yfs CreateFile

A lock type of 0 is "LockRead", which makes the fileserver record an
unintentional read lock on the new file.  This will cause problems
later on if the file is the subject of locking operations.

The correct default value should be -1 ("LockNone").

Fix the operation marshalling code to set the value and provide an enum to
symbolise the values whilst we're at it.
