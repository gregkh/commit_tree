drm/nouveau/fault/tu104: initial support

New registers.

Currently uncertain how exactly to mask fault buffer interrupts.  This will
likely be corrected at around the same time as the new MC interrupt stuff
has been properly figured out and implemented.

For the moment, it shouldn't matter too much.
