KVM: arm64: Relax the restriction on using stage2 PUD huge mapping

We restrict mapping the PUD huge pages in stage2 to only when the
stage2 has 4 level page table, leaving the feature unused with
the default IPA size. But we could use it even with a 3
level page table, i.e, when the PUD level is folded into PGD,
just like the stage1. Relax the condition to allow using the
PUD huge page mappings at stage2 when it is possible.
