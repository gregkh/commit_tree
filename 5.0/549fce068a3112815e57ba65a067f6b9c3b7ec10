ARM: dts: dra7: Add l4 interconnect hierarchy and ti-sysc data

Similar to commit 8f42cb7f64c7 ("ARM: dts: omap4: Add l4 interconnect
hierarchy and ti-sysc data"), let's add proper interconnect hierarchy
for l4 interconnect instances with the related ti-sysc interconnect
module data as in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/bus/ti-sysc.txt.

Using ti-sysc driver binding allows us to start dropping legacy platform
data in arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap*hwmod*data.c files later on in favor of
ti-sysc dts data.

This data is generated based on platform data from a booted system
and the interconnect acces protection registers for ranges. To avoid
regressions, we initially validate the device tree provided data
against the existing platform data on boot.

Note that we cannot yet include this file from the SoC dtsi file until
the child devices are moved to their proper locations in the
interconnect hierarchy in the following patch. Otherwise we would have
the each module probed twice.
