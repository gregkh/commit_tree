MIPS: Only include mmzone.h when CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y

MIPS' asm/mmzone.h includes the machine/platform mmzone.h
unconditionally, but since commit bb53fdf395ee ("MIPS: c-r4k: Add
r4k_blast_scache_node for Loongson-3") is included by asm/rk4cache.h for
all r4k-style configs regardless of CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES.

This is problematic when CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=n because both the
loongson3 & ip27 mmzone.h headers unconditionally define the NODE_DATA
preprocessor macro which is aready defined by linux/mmzone.h, resulting
in the following build error:

  ./include/linux/mmzone.h:907: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   #define NODE_DATA(nid)  (&contig_page_data)

Resolve this by only including the machine mmzone.h when
CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y, which also removes the need for the empty
mach-generic version of the header which we delete.
