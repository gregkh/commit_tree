net/mlx5e: Unblock setting vid 0 for VFs through the uplink rep

It turns out that libvirt uses 0-vid as a default if no vlan was
set for the guest (which is the case for switchdev mode) and errs
if we disallow that:

error: Failed to start domain vm75
error: Cannot set interface MAC/vlanid to 6a:66:2d:48:92:c2/0 \
		for ifname enp59s0f0 vf 0: Operation not supported

So allow this in order not to break existing systems.
