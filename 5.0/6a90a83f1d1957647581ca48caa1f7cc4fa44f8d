mm/mmu_notifier.c: remove mmu_notifier_synchronize()

Contrary to its name, mmu_notifier_synchronize() does not synchronize the
notifier's SRCU instance, but rather waits for RCU callbacks to finish.
i.e.  it invokes rcu_barrier().  The RCU documentation is quite clear on
this matter, explicitly calling out that rcu_barrier() does not imply
synchronize_rcu().

As there are no callers of mmu_notifier_synchronize() and it's unclear
whether any user of mmu_notifier_call_srcu() will ever want to barrier on
their callbacks, simply remove the function.
