kbuild: mark prepare0 as PHONY to fix external module build

Commit c3ff2a5193fa ("powerpc/32: add stack protector support")
caused kernel panic on PowerPC when an external module is used with
CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR because the 'prepare' target was not executed
for the external module build.

Commit e07db28eea38 ("kbuild: fix single target build for external
module") turned it into a build error because the 'prepare' target is
now executed but the 'prepare0' target is missing for the external
module build.

External module on arm/arm64 with CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR_PER_TASK is
also broken in the same way.

Move 'PHONY += prepare0' to the common place. GNU Make is fine with
missing rule for phony targets. I also removed the comment which is
wrong irrespective of this commit.

I minimize the change so it can be easily backported to 4.20.x

To fix v4.20, please backport e07db28eea38 ("kbuild: fix single target
build for external module"), and then this commit.
