rcu: Eliminate BUG_ON() for sync.c

The sync.c file has a number of calls to BUG_ON(), which panics the
kernel, which is not a good strategy for devices (like embedded) that
don't have a way to capture console output.  This commit therefore
changes these BUG_ON() calls to WARN_ON_ONCE(), but does so quite naively.
