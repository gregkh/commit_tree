debugfs: fix debugfs_rename parameter checking

debugfs_rename() needs to check that the dentries passed into it really
are valid, as sometimes they are not (i.e. if the return value of
another debugfs call is passed into this one.)  So fix this up by
properly checking if the two parent directories are errors (they are
allowed to be NULL), and if the dentry to rename is not NULL or an
error.
