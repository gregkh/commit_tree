bnxt_en: Fix typo in firmware message timeout logic.

The logic that polls for the firmware message response uses a shorter
sleep interval for the first few passes.  But there was a typo so it
was using the wrong counter (larger counter) for these short sleep
passes.  The result is a slightly shorter timeout period for these
firmware messages than intended.  Fix it by using the proper counter.
