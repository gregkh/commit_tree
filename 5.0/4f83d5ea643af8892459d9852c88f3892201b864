security: integrity: make ima_main explicitly non-modular

The Makefile/Kconfig entry controlling compilation of this code is:

obj-$(CONFIG_IMA) += ima.o
ima-y := ima_fs.o ima_queue.o ima_init.o ima_main.o ima_crypto.o ima_api.o \
         ima_policy.o ima_template.o ima_template_lib.o

security/integrity/ima/Kconfig:config IMA
security/integrity/ima/Kconfig- bool "Integrity Measurement Architecture(IMA)"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
