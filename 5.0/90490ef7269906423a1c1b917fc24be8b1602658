lan743x: Fix TX Stall Issue

It has been observed that tx queue stalls while downloading
from certain web sites (example www.speedtest.net)

The cause has been tracked down to a corner case where
dma descriptors where not setup properly. And there for a tx
completion interrupt was not signaled.

This fix corrects the problem by properly marking the end of
a multi descriptor transmission.
