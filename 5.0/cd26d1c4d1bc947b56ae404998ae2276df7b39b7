media: vb2: vb2_mmap: move lock up

If a filehandle is dup()ped, then it is possible to close it from one fd
and call mmap from the other. This creates a race condition in vb2_mmap
where it is using queue data that __vb2_queue_free (called from close())
is in the process of releasing.

By moving up the mutex_lock(mmap_lock) in vb2_mmap this race is avoided
since __vb2_queue_free is called with the same mutex locked. So vb2_mmap
now reads consistent buffer data.
