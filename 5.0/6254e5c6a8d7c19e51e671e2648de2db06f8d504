selftests: net: test that listening sockets match on address properly

This patch adds a selftest that verifies that a socket listening
on a specific address is chosen in preference over sockets
that listen on any address. The test covers UDP/UDP6/TCP/TCP6.

It is based on, and similar to, reuseport_dualstack.c selftest.
