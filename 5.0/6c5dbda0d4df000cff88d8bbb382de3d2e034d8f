nfp: abm: reset RED's child based on limit

RED qdisc will replace its child Qdisc with a new FIFO queue if
it is reconfigured and the limit parameter is not 0.

This means that when it's created with limit of 0 it will have no FIFO,
and all packets will be dropped.  If it's changed and limit is specified
it will loose its existing child (implicit graft).  Make sure we mark
RED Qdisc child as NFP_QDISC_UNTRACKED if its not the expected FIFO.

nfp_abm_qdisc_replace() will return 1 if Qdisc already existed.
