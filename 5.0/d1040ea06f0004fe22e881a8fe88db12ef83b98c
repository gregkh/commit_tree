pinctrl: msm: mark PM functions as __maybe_unused

Without CONFIG_PM_SLEEP, we get annoying warnings about unused functions:

drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-msm.c:1082:12: error: 'msm_pinctrl_resume' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
 static int msm_pinctrl_resume(struct device *dev)
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-msm.c:1075:12: error: 'msm_pinctrl_suspend' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
 static int msm_pinctrl_suspend(struct device *dev)

Mark them as __maybe_unused to shut up the warning and silently drop
the functions without having to add ugly #ifdefs.
