x86/kvm/hyper-v: avoid open-coding stimer_mark_pending() in kvm_hv_notify_acked_sint()

stimers_pending optimization only helps us to avoid multiple
kvm_make_request() calls. This doesn't happen very often and these
calls are very cheap in the first place, remove open-coded version of
stimer_mark_pending() from kvm_hv_notify_acked_sint().
