bfs: extra sanity checking and static inode bitmap

Strengthen validation of BFS superblock against corruption.  Make
in-core inode bitmap static part of superblock info structure.  Print a
warning when mounting a BFS filesystem created with "-N 512" option as
only 510 files can be created in the root directory.  Make the kernel
messages more uniform.  Update the 'prefix' passed to bfs_dump_imap() to
match the current naming of operations.  White space and comments
cleanup.
