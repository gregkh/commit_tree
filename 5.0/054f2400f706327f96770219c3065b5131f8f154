pinctrl: sh-pfc: sh7734: Fix shifted values in IPSR10

Some values in the Peripheral Function Select Register 10 descriptor are
shifted by one position, which may cause a peripheral function to be
programmed incorrectly.

Fixing this makes all HSCIF0 pins use Function 4 (value 3), like was
already the case for the HSCK0 pin in field IP10[5:3].
