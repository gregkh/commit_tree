relay: check return of create_buf_file() properly

If create_buf_file() returns an error, don't try to reference it later
as a valid dentry pointer.

This problem was exposed when debugfs started to return errors instead
of just NULL for some calls when they do not succeed properly.

Also, the check for WARN_ON(dentry) was just wrong :)
