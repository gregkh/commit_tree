net/ipv6: don't return positive numbers when nothing was dumped

in6_dump_addrs() returns a positive 1 if there was nothing to dump.
This return value can not be passed as return from inet6_dump_addr()
as is, because it will confuse rtnetlink, resulting in NLMSG_DONE
never getting set:

$ ip addr list dev lo
EOF on netlink
Dump terminated

v2: flip condition to avoid a new goto (DaveA)
