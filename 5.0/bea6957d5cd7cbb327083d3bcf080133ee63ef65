tracing: Simplify printf'ing in seq_print_sym

trace_seq_printf(..., "%s", ...) can be done with trace_seq_puts()
instead, avoiding printf overhead. In the second instance, the string
we're copying was just created from an snprintf() to a stack buffer, so
we might as well do that printf directly. This naturally leads to moving
the declaration of the str buffer inside the CONFIG_KALLSYMS guard,
which in turn will make gcc inline the function for !CONFIG_KALLSYMS (it
only has a single caller, but the huge stack frame seems to make gcc not
inline it for CONFIG_KALLSYMS).
