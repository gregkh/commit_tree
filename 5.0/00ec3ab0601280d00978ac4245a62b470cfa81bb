netfilter: ipset: replace a strncpy() with strscpy()

To make overflows as obvious as possible and to prevent code from blithely
proceeding with a truncated string. This also has a side-effect to fix a
compilation warning when using GCC 8.2.1.

net/netfilter/ipset/ip_set_core.c: In function 'ip_set_sockfn_get':
net/netfilter/ipset/ip_set_core.c:2027:3: warning: 'strncpy' writing 32 bytes into a region of size 2 overflows the destination [-Wstringop-overflow=]
