IB/mlx5: Use the new mlx5 core notifier API

Remove the deprecated mlx5_interface->event mlx5_ib callback and use new
mlx5 notifier API to subscribe for mlx5 events.

For native mlx5_ib devices profiles pf_profile/nic_rep_profile register
the notifier callback mlx5_ib_handle_event which treats the notifier
context as mlx5_ib_dev.

For vport repesentors, don't register any notifier, same as before, they
didn't receive any mlx5 events.

For slave port (mlx5_ib_multiport_info) register a different notifier
callback mlx5_ib_event_slave_port, which knows that the event is coming
for mlx5_ib_multiport_info and prepares the event job accordingly.
Before this on the event handler work we had to ask mlx5_core if this is
a slave port mlx5_core_is_mp_slave(work->dev), now it is not needed
anymore.
mlx5_ib_multiport_info notifier registration is done on
mlx5_ib_bind_slave_port and de-registration is done on
mlx5_ib_unbind_slave_port.
