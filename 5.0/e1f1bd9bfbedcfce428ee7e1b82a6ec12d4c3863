net: ena: fix race between link up and device initalization

Fix race condition between ena_update_on_link_change() and
ena_restore_device().

This race can occur if link notification arrives while the driver
is performing a reset sequence. In this case link can be set up,
enabling the device, before it is fully restored. If packets are
sent at this time, the driver might access uninitialized data
structures, causing kernel crash.

Move the clearing of ENA_FLAG_ONGOING_RESET and netif_carrier_on()
after ena_up() to ensure the device is ready when link is set up.
