udpv6: fix possible user after free in error handler

Before derefencing the encap pointer, commit e7cc082455cb ("udp: Support
for error handlers of tunnels with arbitrary destination port") checks
for a NULL value, but the two fetch operation can race with removal.
Fix the above using a single access.
Also fix a couple of type annotations, to make sparse happy.
