drivers: thermal: int340x_thermal: Make PCI dependency explicit

After commit 5d32a66541c4 (PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without
CONFIG_PCI set) dependencies on CONFIG_PCI that previously were
satisfied implicitly through dependencies on CONFIG_ACPI have to be
specified directly.

IOSF_CORE depends on PCI. For this reason, add a direct dependency on
CONFIG_PCI.
