drm/i915/icl: Disable master intr before reading

Disable master interrupt before reading level indications.
This will close a race where we get a level indication between
reading and disabling, generating an extra interrupt where we
could have avoided one.

Further, as the reading acts also as a post, replace the
write/post on the irq reset with the helper. On enabling side,
posting doesn't serve any purpose so it can also be replaced
with helper.
