powerpc/8xx: reintroduce 16K pages with HW assistance

Using this HW assistance implies some constraints on the
page table structure:
- Regardless of the main page size used (4k or 16k), the
level 1 table (PGD) contains 1024 entries and each PGD entry covers
a 4Mbytes area which is managed by a level 2 table (PTE) containing
also 1024 entries each describing a 4k page.
- 16k pages require 4 identifical entries in the L2 table
- 512k pages PTE have to be spread every 128 bytes in the L2 table
- 8M pages PTE are at the address pointed by the L1 entry and each
8M page require 2 identical entries in the PGD.

In order to use hardware assistance with 16K pages, this patch does
the following modifications:
- Make PGD size independent of the main page size
- In 16k pages mode, redefine pte_t as a struct with 4 elements,
and populate those 4 elements in __set_pte_at() and pte_update()
- Adapt the size of the hugepage tables.
- Define a PTE_FRAGMENT_NB so that a 16k page contains 4 page tables.
