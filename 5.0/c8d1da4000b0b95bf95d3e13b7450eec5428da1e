netfilter: Replace call_rcu_bh(), rcu_barrier_bh(), and synchronize_rcu_bh()

Now that call_rcu()'s callback is not invoked until after bh-disable
regions of code have completed (in addition to explicitly marked
RCU read-side critical sections), call_rcu() can be used in place
of call_rcu_bh().  Similarly, rcu_barrier() can be used in place of
rcu_barrier_bh() and synchronize_rcu() in place of synchronize_rcu_bh().
This commit therefore makes these changes.
