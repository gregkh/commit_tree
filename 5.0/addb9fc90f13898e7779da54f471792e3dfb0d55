bpf: adding support for map in map in libbpf

idea is pretty simple. for specified map (pointed by struct bpf_map)
we would provide descriptor of already loaded map, which is going to be
used as a prototype for inner map. proposed workflow:
1) open bpf's object (bpf_object__open)
2) create bpf's map which is going to be used as a prototype
3) find (by name) map-in-map which you want to load and update w/
descriptor of inner map w/ a new helper from this patch
4) load bpf program w/ bpf_object__load
