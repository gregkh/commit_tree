kbuild: change filechk to surround the given command with { }

filechk_* rules often consist of multiple 'echo' lines. They must be
surrounded with { } or ( ) to work correctly. Otherwise, only the
string from the last 'echo' would be written into the target.

Let's take care of that in the 'filechk' in scripts/Kbuild.include
to clean up filechk_* rules.
