keys: remove needless modular infrastructure from ecryptfs_format

Even though the support can be modular, only one file needs to use
all the macros like MODULE_AUTHOR, MODULE_LICENSE etc.  Only the one
responsible for registering/removal with module_init/module_exit
needs to declare these.  In this case, that file is "encrypted.c"
and it already has the MODULE_LICENSE that we are removing here.

Since the file does EXPORT_SYMBOL, we add export.h - and build tests
show that module.h (which includes everything) was hiding an implicit
use of string.h - so that is added as well.
