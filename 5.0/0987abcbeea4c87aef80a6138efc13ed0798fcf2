modpost: drop unused command line switches

Drop modpost command line switches that are no longer used by
makefile.modpost, upon request from Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>,

    modpost is not supposed to be used outside the kernel build. [...]
    I checked if there were any options supported by modpost that
    was not configurable in Makefile.modpost.
    And I could see that the -M and -K options in getopt() were leftovers.
    The code that used these option was dropped in:
    commit a8773769d1a1 ("Kbuild: clear marker out of modpost")

    Could you add a patch that delete these on top of what you already have.
