srcu: Use "ssp" instead of "sp" for srcu_struct pointer

In RCU, the distinction between "rsp", "rnp", and "rdp" has served well
for a great many years, but in SRCU, "sp" vs. "sdp" has proven confusing.
This commit therefore renames SRCU's "sp" pointers to "ssp", so that there
is "ssp" for srcu_struct pointer, "snp" for srcu_node pointer, and "sdp"
for srcu_data pointer.
