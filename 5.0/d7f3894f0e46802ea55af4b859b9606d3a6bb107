ARM: dts: imx7: Correct mask for GIC PPI interrupts

The GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE() macro should take as its argument the actual
number of CPU cores the interrupt controller is wired to.

i.MX7S contains a single Cortex-A7, hence the second interrupt specifier
cell for Private Peripheral Interrupts should use "GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(1)".

Likewise, i.MX7D contains two Cortex-A7 cores, so it should use
"GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(2)" instead.

Tested on a imx7s-warp.
