ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add more platform granularity

The current SKYLAKE kconfig is a all-you-can-eat selection that will
support all known plaforms. This is however not necessarily a good
thing: most platforms for SKL and KBL don't support the DSP, but a
number of CNL/WHL ones do. Selecting this driver in all cases isn't
really smart and will require users to muck with blacklists.

Partition the configs to allow distributions to select on which
platform this driver is used. Keep the existing SND_SOC_INTEL_SKYLAKE
config to select everything for backwards compatibility. This patch does
not provide new functionality, only finer-grained choices in supported
platforms.
