block: use atomic bitops for ->queue_flags

->queue_flags is generally not set or cleared in the fast path, and also
generally set or cleared one flag at a time.  Make use of the normal
atomic bitops for it so that we don't need to take the queue_lock,
which is otherwise mostly unused in the core block layer now.
