mmc: tmio: enable module clock before resetting when resuming

On runtime power management resume, the host clock needs to be
enabled before calling tmio_mmc_reset. If the mmc device has a power
domain entry, the host clock is enabled via genpd_runtime_resume,
running before tmio_mmc_host_runtime_resume. If the mmc device has no
power domain entry, however, genpd_runtime_resume is not called. This
patch changes tmio_mmc_host_runtime_resume to enable the host clock
before calling tmio_mmc_reset.

Based on work from Masaharu Hayakawa.
