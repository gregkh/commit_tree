udp: fix jump label misuse

The commit 60fb9567bf30 ("udp: implement complete book-keeping for
encap_needed") introduced a severe misuse of jump label APIs, which
syzbot, as reported by Eric, was able to exploit.

When multiple sockets/process can concurrently request (and than
disable) the udp encap, we need to track the activation counter with
*_inc()/*_dec() jump label variants, or we can experience bad things
at disable time.
