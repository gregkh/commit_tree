nvme: support traffic based keep-alive

If the controller supports traffic based keep alive, we restart the keep
alive timer if any admin or io commands was completed during the kato
period.  This prevents a possible starvation of keep alive commands in
the presence of heavy traffic as in such case, we already have a health
indication from the host perspective.

Only set a comp_seen indicator in case the controller supports keep
alive to minimize the overhead for pci controllers.
