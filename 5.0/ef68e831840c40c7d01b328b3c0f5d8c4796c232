CIFS: Do not reconnect TCP session in add_credits()

When executing add_credits() we currently call cifs_reconnect()
if the number of credits is zero and there are no requests in
flight. In this case we may call cifs_reconnect() recursively
twice and cause memory corruption given the following sequence
of functions:

mid1.callback() -> add_credits() -> cifs_reconnect() ->
-> mid2.callback() -> add_credits() -> cifs_reconnect().

Fix this by avoiding to call cifs_reconnect() in add_credits()
and checking for zero credits in the demultiplex thread.
