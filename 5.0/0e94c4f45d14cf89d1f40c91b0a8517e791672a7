btrfs: scrub: move scrub_setup_ctx allocation out of device_list_mutex

The scrub context is allocated with GFP_KERNEL and called from
btrfs_scrub_dev under the fs_info::device_list_mutex. This is not safe
regarding reclaim that could try to flush filesystem data in order to
get the memory. And the device_list_mutex is held during superblock
commit, so this would cause a lockup.

Move the alocation and initialization before any changes that require
the mutex.
