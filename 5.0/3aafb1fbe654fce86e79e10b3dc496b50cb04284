security: integrity: make evm_main explicitly non-modular

The Makefile/Kconfig entry controlling compilation of this code is:

obj-$(CONFIG_EVM) += evm.o
evm-y := evm_main.o evm_crypto.o evm_secfs.o

security/integrity/evm/Kconfig:config EVM
security/integrity/evm/Kconfig: bool "EVM support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
