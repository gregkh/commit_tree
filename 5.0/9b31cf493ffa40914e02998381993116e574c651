arm64: mm: Introduce MAX_USER_VA_BITS definition

With the introduction of 52-bit virtual addressing for userspace, we are
now in a position where the virtual addressing capability of userspace
may exceed that of the kernel. Consequently, the VA_BITS definition
cannot be used blindly, since it reflects only the size of kernel
virtual addresses.

This patch introduces MAX_USER_VA_BITS which is either VA_BITS or 52
depending on whether 52-bit virtual addressing has been configured at
build time, removing a few places where the 52 is open-coded based on
explicit CONFIG_ guards.
