RDMA/uverbs: Replace ib_uverbs_file with uverbs_attr_bundle for write

Now that we can add meta-data to the description of write() methods we
need to pass the uverbs_attr_bundle into all write based handlers so
future patches can use it as a container for any new data transferred out
of the core.

This is the first step to bringing the write() and ioctl() methods to a
common interface signature.

This is a simple search/replace, and we push the attr down into the uobj
and other APIs to keep changes minimal.
