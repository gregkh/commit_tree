s390/qeth: unify transmit code

Since commit 82bf5c0867f6 ("s390/qeth: add support for IPv6 TSO"),
qeth_xmit() also knows how to build TSO packets and is practically
identical to qeth_l3_xmit().
Convert qeth_l3_xmit() into a thin wrapper that merely strips the
L2 header off a packet, and calls qeth_xmit() for the actual
TX processing.
