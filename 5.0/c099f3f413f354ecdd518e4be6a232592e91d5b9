selftests: bpf: update testcases for BPF_ALU | BPF_ARSH

"arsh32 on imm" and "arsh32 on reg" now are accepted. Also added two new
testcases to make sure arsh32 won't be treated as arsh64 during
interpretation or JIT code-gen for which case the high bits will be moved
into low halve that the testcases could catch them.
