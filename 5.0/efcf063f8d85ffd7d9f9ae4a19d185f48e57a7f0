drm/amdgpu: fix sdma v4 ring is disabled accidently

For sdma v4, there is bug caused by
commit d4e869b6b5d6 ("drm/amdgpu: add ring test for page queue")'

local variable ring is reused and changed, so amdgpu_ttm_set_buffer_funcs_status(adev, true)
is skipped accidently. As a result, amdgpu_fill_buffer() will fail, kernel message:
