x86/vdso: Remove a stale/misleading comment from the linker script

Once upon a time, vdso2c aggressively stripped data from the vDSO
image when generating the final userspace image.  This included
stripping the .altinstructions and .altinstr_replacement sections.
Eventually, the stripping process reverted to "objdump -S" and no
longer removed the aforementioned sections, but the comment remained.

Keeping the .alt* sections at the end of the PT_LOAD segment is no
longer necessary, but there's no harm in doing so and it's a helpful
reminder that they don't need to be included in the final vDSO image,
i.e. someone may want to take another stab at zapping/stripping the
unneeded sections.
