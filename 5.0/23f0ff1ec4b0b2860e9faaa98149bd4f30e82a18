btrfs: alloc_chunk: improve chunk size variable name

The variable num_bytes is really a way too generic name for a variable
in this function. There are a dozen other variables that hold a number
of bytes as value.

Give it a name that actually describes what it does, which is holding
the size of the chunk that we're allocating.
