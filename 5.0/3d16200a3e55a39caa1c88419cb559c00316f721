ALSA: fireface: fix for state to fetch PCM frames

According to my memo at hand and saved records, writing 0x00000001 to
SND_FF_REG_FETCH_PCM_FRAMES disables fetching PCM frames in corresponding
channel, however current implement uses reversed logic. This results in
muted volume in device side during playback.

This commit corrects the bug.
