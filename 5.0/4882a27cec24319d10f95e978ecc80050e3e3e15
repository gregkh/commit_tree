afs: Don't set vnode->cb_s_break in afs_validate()

A cb_interest record is not necessarily attached to the vnode on entry to
afs_validate(), which can cause an oops when we try to bring the vnode's
cb_s_break up to date in the default case (ie. no current callback promise
and the vnode has not been deleted).

Fix this by simply removing the line, as vnode->cb_s_break will be set when
needed by afs_register_server_cb_interest() when we next get a callback
promise from RPC call.

The oops looks something like:

    BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000018
