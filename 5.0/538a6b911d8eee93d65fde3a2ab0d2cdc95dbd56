ARM: imx_v6_v7_defconfig: Enable DA9063 PMIC support

All recent emtrion modules based on i.mx6 make use of the DA9063.
Therefore enable it with the following defaults:
	- CONFIG_MFD_DA9063=y
	- CONFIG_REGULATOR_DA9063=y
	- CONFIG_DA9063_WATCHDOG=m
MFD and REGULATOR are built-in to have it at Kernel boot-time.
The WATCHDOG is optional and could be loaded from userspace.
