KVM: arm64: Clarify explanation of STAGE2_PGTABLE_LEVELS

In attempting to re-construct the logic for our stage 2 page table
layout I found the reasoning in the comment explaining how we calculate
the number of levels used for stage 2 page tables a bit backwards.

This commit attempts to clarify the comment, to make it slightly easier
to read without having the Arm ARM open on the right page.

While we're at it, fixup a typo in a comment that was recently changed.
