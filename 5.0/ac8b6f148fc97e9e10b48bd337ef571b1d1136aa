Fonts: New Terminus large console font

This patch adds an option to compile-in a high resolution
and large Terminus (ter16x32) bitmap console font for use with
HiDPI and Retina screens.

The font was convereted from standard Terminus ter-i32b.psf
(size 16x32) with the help of psftools and minor hand editing
deleting useless characters.

This patch is non-intrusive, no options are enabled by default so most
users won't notice a thing.

I am placing my changes under the GPL 2.0 just as source Terminus font.
