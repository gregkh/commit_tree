s390/mm: Convert tlb_table_flush() to use call_rcu()

Now that call_rcu()'s callback is not invoked until after all
preempt-disable regions of code have completed (in addition to explicitly
marked RCU read-side critical sections), call_rcu() can be used in place
of call_rcu_sched().  This commit therefore makes that change.
