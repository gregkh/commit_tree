mm/mmap.c: remove verify_mm_writelocked()

We should get rid of this function.  It no longer serves its purpose.
This is a historical artifact from 2005 where do_brk was called outside of
the core mm.  We do have a proper abstraction in vm_brk_flags and that one
does the locking properly so there is no need to use this function.
