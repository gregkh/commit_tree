net: systemport: Restore Broadcom tag match filters upon resume

Some of the system suspend states that we support wipe out entirely the
HW contents. If we had a Wake-on-LAN filter programmed prior to going
into suspend, but we did not actually wake-up from Wake-on-LAN and
instead used a deeper suspend state, make sure we restore the CID number
that we need to match against.
