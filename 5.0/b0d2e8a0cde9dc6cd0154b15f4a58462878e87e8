clk: qcom: gcc-msm8998: Drop hmss_dvm and lpass_at

Disabling gcc_hmss_dvm_bus_clk and gcc_lpass_at_clk causes the board to
lock up, and by that preventing the kernel to boot without
clk_ignore_unused.

gcc_hmss_dvm_bus_clk is marked always-on downstream, but not referenced,
and gcc_lpass_at_clk isn't mentioned. So let's remove them until they
are needed by some client.
