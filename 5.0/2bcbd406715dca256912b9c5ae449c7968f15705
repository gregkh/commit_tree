Revert "compiler-gcc: disable -ftracer for __noclone functions"

The -ftracer optimization was disabled in __noclone as a workaround to
GCC duplicating a blob of inline assembly that happened to define a
global variable.  It has been pointed out that no amount of workarounds
can guarantee the compiler won't duplicate inline assembly[1], and that
disabling the -ftracer optimization has several unintended and nasty
side effects[2][3].

Now that the offending KVM code which required the workaround has
been properly fixed and no longer uses __noclone, remove the -ftracer
optimization tweak from __noclone.
