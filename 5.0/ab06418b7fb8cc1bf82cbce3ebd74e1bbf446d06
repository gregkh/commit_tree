net: phy: Fixup GPLv2+ SPDX tags based on license text

A few PHY drivers have the GPLv2+ license text. They then either have
a MODULE_LICENSE() of GPLv2 only, or an SPDX tag of GPLv2 only.

Since the license text is much easier to understand than either the
SPDX tag or the MODULE_LICENSE, use it as the definitive source of the
licence, and fixup the others when there are contradictions.
