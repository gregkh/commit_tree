scsi: megaraid_sas: Add check for reset adapter bit

For SAS3 and later controllers, FW sets the reset adapter bit indicating
the driver to perform a controller reset.  Driver needs to check if this
bit is set before doing a reset.  This reduces the driver probe failure
time to 180seconds in case there is a faulty controller connected.
