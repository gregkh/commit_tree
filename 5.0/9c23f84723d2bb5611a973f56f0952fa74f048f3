arm64: move untagged_addr macro from uaccess.h to memory.h

Move the untagged_addr() macro from arch/arm64/include/asm/uaccess.h
to arch/arm64/include/asm/memory.h to be later reused by KASAN.

Also make the untagged_addr() macro accept all kinds of address types
(void *, unsigned long, etc.). This allows not to specify type casts in
each place where the macro is used. This is done by using __typeof__.
