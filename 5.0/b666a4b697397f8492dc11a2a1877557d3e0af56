kvm: x86: Dynamically allocate guest_fpu

Previously, the guest_fpu field was embedded in the kvm_vcpu_arch
struct. Unfortunately, the field is quite large, (e.g., 4352 bytes on my
current setup). This bloats the kvm_vcpu_arch struct for x86 into an
order 3 memory allocation, which can become a problem on overcommitted
machines. Thus, this patch moves the fpu state outside of the
kvm_vcpu_arch struct.

With this patch applied, the kvm_vcpu_arch struct is reduced to 15168
bytes for vmx on my setup when building the kernel with kvmconfig.
