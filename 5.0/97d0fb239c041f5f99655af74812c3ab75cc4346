cred: add get_cred_rcu()

Sometimes we want to opportunistically get a
ref to a cred in an rcu_read_lock protected section.
get_task_cred() does this, and NFS does as similar thing
with its own credential structures.
To prepare for NFS converting to use 'struct cred' more
uniformly, define get_cred_rcu(), and use it in
get_task_cred().
