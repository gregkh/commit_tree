ASoC: simple-card: merge simple-scu-card

simple-card and simple-scu-card are very similar driver,
but the former is supporting normal sound card,
the latter is supporting DPCM sound card.

We couldn't use normal sound and DPCM sound in same time by
one sound card. This patch merges both sound card into
simple-card. Now we can use both feature on same driver.

simple-card is now supporting .compatible = "simple-scu-audio-card".
