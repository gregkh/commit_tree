crypto: ecc - regularize scalar for scalar multiplication

ecc_point_mult is supposed to be used with a regularized scalar,
otherwise, it's possible to deduce the position of the top bit of the
scalar with timing attack. This is important when the scalar is a
private key.

ecc_point_mult is already using a regular algorithm (i.e. having an
operation flow independent of the input scalar) but regularization step
is not implemented.

Arrange scalar to always have fixed top bit by adding a multiple of the
curve order (n).
