x86/mm: Make set_pmd_at() paravirt aware

set_pmd_at() calls native_set_pmd() unconditionally on x86. This was
fine as long as only huge page entries were written via set_pmd_at(),
as Xen pv guests don't support those.

Commit 2c91bd4a4e2e53 ("mm: speed up mremap by 20x on large regions")
introduced a usage of set_pmd_at() possible on pv guests, leading to
failures like:

BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff888023e26778
#PF error: [PROT] [WRITE]
RIP: e030:move_page_tables+0x7c1/0xae0

__se_sys_mremap+0x3c6/0x5b0
 do_syscall_64+0x49/0x100
entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9

Make set_pmd_at() paravirt aware by just letting it use set_pmd().
