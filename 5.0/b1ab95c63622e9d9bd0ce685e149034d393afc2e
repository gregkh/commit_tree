arch: Make phys_initrd_start and phys_initrd_size global variables

Make phys_initrd_start and phys_initrd_size global variables declared in
init/do_mounts_initrd.c such that we can later have generic code in
drivers/of/fdt.c populate those variables for us.

This requires both the ARM and unicore32 implementations to be properly
guarded against CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD, and also initialize the variables
to the expected default values (unicore32).
