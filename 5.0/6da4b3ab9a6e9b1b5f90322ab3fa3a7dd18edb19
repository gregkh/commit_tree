genirq/affinity: Add support for allocating interrupt sets

A driver may have a need to allocate multiple sets of MSI/MSI-X interrupts,
and have them appropriately affinitized.

Add support for defining a number of sets in the irq_affinity structure, of
varying sizes, and get each set affinitized correctly across the machine.
