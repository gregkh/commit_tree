KVM: VMX: Move capabilities structs and helpers to dedicated file

Defining a separate capabilities.h as opposed to putting this code in
e.g. vmx.h avoids circular dependencies between (the yet-to-be-added)
vmx.h and nested.h.  The aforementioned circular dependencies are why
struct nested_vmx_msrs also resides in capabilities instead of e.g.
nested.h.
