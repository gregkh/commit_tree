crypto: user - support incremental algorithm dumps

CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG in NLM_F_DUMP mode sometimes doesn't return all
registered crypto algorithms, because it doesn't support incremental
dumps.  crypto_dump_report() only permits itself to be called once, yet
the netlink subsystem allocates at most ~64 KiB for the skb being dumped
to.  Thus only the first recvmsg() returns data, and it may only include
a subset of the crypto algorithms even if the user buffer passed to
recvmsg() is large enough to hold all of them.

Fix this by using one of the arguments in the netlink_callback structure
to keep track of the current position in the algorithm list.  Then
userspace can do multiple recvmsg() on the socket after sending the dump
request.  This is the way netlink dumps work elsewhere in the kernel;
it's unclear why this was different (probably just an oversight).

Also fix an integer overflow when calculating the dump buffer size hint.
