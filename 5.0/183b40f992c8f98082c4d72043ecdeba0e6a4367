MIPS: Allow FP support to be disabled

Allow the user to configure the kernel to omit support for floating
point, by setting CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n. In an attempt to avoid
problems for users who don't understand the impact of this, only expose
the option when CONFIG_EXPERT=y.

When CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n all support for FPU hardware, FPU
emulation & FP context will be removed from the kernel. If a userland
program attempts to execute a floating point instruction it will receive
a SIGILL.

Setting CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n shaves around 112KB from a
64r6el_defconfig build using GCC 8.1.0.

This also helps prepare us for supporting the nanoMIPS ISA, for which
floating point support has not been finalized.
