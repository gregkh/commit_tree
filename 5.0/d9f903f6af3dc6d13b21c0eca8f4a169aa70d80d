net: phy: fix too strict check in phy_start_aneg

When adding checks to detect wrong usage of the phylib API we added
a check to phy_start_aneg() which is too strict. If the phylib
state machine is in state PHY_HALTED we should allow reconfiguring
and restarting aneg, and just don't touch the state.
