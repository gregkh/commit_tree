btrfs: Remove redundant extent_buffer_get in get_old_root

get_old_root used used only by btrfs_search_old_slot to initialise the
path structure. The old root is always a cloned buffer (either via alloc
dummy or via btrfs_clone_extent_buffer) and its reference count is 2: 1
from allocation, 1 from extent_buffer_get call in get_old_root.

This latter explicit ref count acquire operation is in fact unnecessary
since the semantic is such that the newly allocated buffer is handed
over to the btrfs_path for lifetime management. Considering this just
remove the extra extent_buffer_get in get_old_root.
