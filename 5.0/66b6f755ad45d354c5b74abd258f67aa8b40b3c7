rcutorture: Import a copy of nolibc

This is a definition of the most common syscalls needed in minimalist
init executables, allowing to statically build them with no external
dependencies. It is sufficient in its current form to build rcutorture's
init on x86_64, i386, arm, and arm64. Others have not been ported or
tested. Updates may be found here :
