ipv4: Return error for RTA_VIA attribute

IPv4 currently does not support nexthops outside of the AF_INET family.
Specifically, it does not handle RTA_VIA attribute. If it is passed
in a route add request, the actual route added only uses the device
which is clearly not what the user intended:

  $ ip ro add 172.16.1.0/24 via inet6 2001:db8:1::1 dev eth0
  $ ip ro ls
  ...
  172.16.1.0/24 dev eth0

Catch this and fail the route add:
  $ ip ro add 172.16.1.0/24 via inet6 2001:db8:1::1 dev eth0
  Error: IPv4 does not support RTA_VIA attribute.
