btrfs: Replace BUG_ON with ASSERT in find_lock_delalloc_range

lock_delalloc_pages should only return 2 values - 0 in case of success
and -EAGAIN if the range of pages to be locked should be shrunk due to
some of gone. Manual inspections confirms that this is indeed the case
since __process_pages_contig is where lock_delalloc_pages gets its
return value. The latter always returns 0  or -EAGAIN so the invariant
holds. No functional changes.
