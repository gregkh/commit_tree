generic/pgtable: Introduce set_pte_safe()

Commit:

  f77084d96355 "x86/mm/pat: Disable preemption around __flush_tlb_all()"

introduced a warning to capture cases __flush_tlb_all() is called without
pre-emption disabled. It triggers a false positive warning in the memory
hotplug path.

On investigation it was found that the __flush_tlb_all() calls are not
necessary. However, they are only "not necessary" in practice provided
the ptes are being initially populated from the !present state.

Introduce set_pte_safe() as a sanity check that the pte is being updated
in a way that does not require a TLB flush.

Forgive the macro, the availability of the various of set_pte() levels
is hit and miss across architectures.
