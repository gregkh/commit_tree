block: prevent merging of requests with different priorities

Growing in size a high priority request by merging it with a lower
priority BIO or request will increase the request execution time. This
is the opposite result of the desired effect of high I/O priorities,
namely getting low I/O latencies. Prevent merging of requests and BIOs
that have different I/O priorities to fix this.
