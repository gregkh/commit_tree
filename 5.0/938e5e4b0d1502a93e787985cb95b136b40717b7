sched/cpufreq: Prepare schedutil for Energy Aware Scheduling

Schedutil requests frequency by aggregating utilization signals from
the scheduler (CFS, RT, DL, IRQ) and applying a 25% margin on top of
them. Since Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS) needs to be able to predict
the frequency requests, it needs to forecast the decisions made by the
governor.

In order to prepare the introduction of EAS, introduce
schedutil_freq_util() to centralize the aforementioned signal
aggregation and make it available to both schedutil and EAS. Since
frequency selection and energy estimation still need to deal with RT and
DL signals slightly differently, schedutil_freq_util() is called with a
different 'type' parameter in those two contexts, and returns an
aggregated utilization signal accordingly. While at it, introduce the
map_util_freq() function which is designed to make schedutil's 25%
margin usable easily for both sugov and EAS.

As EAS will be able to predict schedutil's frequency requests more
accurately than any other governor by design, it'd be sensible to make
sure EAS cannot be used without schedutil. This will be done later, once
EAS has actually been introduced.
