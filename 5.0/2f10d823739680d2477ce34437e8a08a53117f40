drm/amd/powerplay: Fix missing break in switch

Add missing break statement in order to prevent the code from falling
through to the default case.

The resoning for this is that pclk_vol_table is an automatic variable.
So, it makes no sense to update it just before falling through to the
default case and return -EINVAL.

This bug was found thanks to the ongoing efforts to enabling
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
