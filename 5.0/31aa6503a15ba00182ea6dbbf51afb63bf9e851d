bpf: correctly set initial window on active Fast Open sender

The existing BPF TCP initial congestion window (TCP_BPF_IW) does not
to work on (active) Fast Open sender. This is because it changes the
(initial) window only if data_segs_out is zero -- but data_segs_out
is also incremented on SYN-data.  This patch fixes the issue by
proerly accounting for SYN-data additionally.
