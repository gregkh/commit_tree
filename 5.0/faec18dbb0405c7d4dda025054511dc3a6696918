netfilter: nat: remove l4proto->manip_pkt

This removes the last l4proto indirection, the two callers, the l3proto
packet mangling helpers for ipv4 and ipv6, now call the
nf_nat_l4proto_manip_pkt() helper.

nf_nat_proto_{dccp,tcp,sctp,gre,icmp,icmpv6} are left behind, even though
they contain no functionality anymore to not clutter this patch.

Next patch will remove the empty files and the nf_nat_l4proto
struct.

nf_nat_proto_udp.c is renamed to nf_nat_proto.c, as it now contains the
other nat manip functionality as well, not just udp and udplite.
