l2tp: fix reading optional fields of L2TPv3

Use pskb_may_pull() to make sure the optional fields are in skb linear
parts, so we can safely read them later.

It's easy to reproduce the issue with a net driver that supports paged
skb data. Just create a L2TPv3 over IP tunnel and then generates some
network traffic.
Once reproduced, rx err in /sys/kernel/debug/l2tp/tunnels will increase.

Changes in v4:
1. s/l2tp_v3_pull_opt/l2tp_v3_ensure_opt_in_linear/
2. s/tunnel->version != L2TP_HDR_VER_2/tunnel->version == L2TP_HDR_VER_3/
3. Add 'Fixes' in commit messages.

Changes in v3:
1. To keep consistency, move the code out of l2tp_recv_common.
2. Use "net" instead of "net-next", since this is a bug fix.

Changes in v2:
1. Only fix L2TPv3 to make code simple.
   To fix both L2TPv3 and L2TPv2, we'd better refactor l2tp_recv_common.
   It's complicated to do so.
2. Reloading pointers after pskb_may_pull
