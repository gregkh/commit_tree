drm/i915: Apply correct ddi translation table for AML device

Amber Lake used the same gen graphics as Kaby Lake. Kernel driver
should configure KBL's DDI buffer setting for AML ULX as well.

So far, driver would load DDI translation table that used for
KBL H/S platform and apply it on AML devices. But AML is belong to
ULX series. This change will lead driver to apply KBL-Y's DDI table
for AML devices to avoid unexpected eDP/DP signal quality issue.
