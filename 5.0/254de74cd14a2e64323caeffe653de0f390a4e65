perf top: Move lost events warning to helpline

We can't display the UI box saying that we are slow in the reader
thread.  That will make 'perf top' even slower and the user even more
angry ;-)

Move the UI box message from the reader thread to the UI thread and
change it to a helpline, so there's no need to 'press any key'.
