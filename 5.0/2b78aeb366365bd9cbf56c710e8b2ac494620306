crypto: inside-secure - remove useless setting of type flags

Remove the unnecessary setting of CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_SKCIPHER.
Commit 2c95e6d97892 ("crypto: skcipher - remove useless setting of type
flags") took care of this everywhere else, but a few more instances made
it into the tree at about the same time.  Squash them before they get
copy+pasted around again.

This patch shouldn't change any actual behavior.
