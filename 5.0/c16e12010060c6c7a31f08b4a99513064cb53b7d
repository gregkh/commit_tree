ASoC: dapm: fix out-of-bounds accesses to DAPM lookup tables

KASAN reports and additional traces point to out-of-bounds accesses to
the dapm_up_seq and dapm_down_seq lookup tables. The indices used are
larger than the array definition.

Fix by adding missing entries for the new widget types in these two
lookup tables, and align them with PGA values.

Also the sequences for the following widgets were not defined. Since
their values defaulted to zero, assign them explicitly

 snd_soc_dapm_input
 snd_soc_dapm_output
 snd_soc_dapm_vmid
 snd_soc_dapm_siggen
 snd_soc_dapm_sink
