media: uvcvideo: queue: Support asynchronous buffer handling

The buffer queue interface currently operates sequentially, processing
buffers after they have fully completed.

In preparation for supporting parallel tasks operating on the buffers,
we will need to support buffers being processed on multiple CPUs.

Adapt the uvc_queue_next_buffer() such that a reference count tracks the
active use of the buffer, returning the buffer to the VB2 stack at
completion.
