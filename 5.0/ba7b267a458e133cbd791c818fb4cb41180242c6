drm/amd/display: Retiring set_display_requirements in dm_pp_smu.h - part4

[Why]
In DCN we want direct DC to SMU calls, with minimal interference from
pplib.
The reason for each pp_smu interface mapping to 1 SMU message is so we
can have the sequencing of different SMU message in DC and shared across
different OS's.
This will also simplify debugging as DAL owns this interaction and
there's no confusion about division of ownership.

[How]
Part 4: Change clock units so they match the values PPLib sends to SMU.
