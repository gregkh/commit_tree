powerpc/mm: Make NULL pointer deferences explicit on bad page faults.

As several other arches including x86, this patch makes it explicit
that a bad page fault is a NULL pointer dereference when the fault
address is lower than PAGE_SIZE

In the mean time, this page makes all bad_page_fault() messages
shorter so that they remain on one single line. And it prefixes them
by "BUG: " so that they get easily grepped.
