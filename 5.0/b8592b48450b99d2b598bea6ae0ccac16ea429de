drm/amd/display: Initial documentation for AMDgpu DC

[Why]
Documentation is helpful for the community to understand our code.
This change does some high-level documentation of some DM interfaces
with DRM, and the amdgpu base driver.

[How]
An entry for AMDgpu DC has been added to Documentation/gpu/drivers.rst
TOC. amdgpu-dc.rst is created to pull in inline doc-strings, which:
- Provides an overview for "What is DM?"
- Documents AMDgpu DM lifecyle
- Documents IRQ management
- Documents atomic_check and commit_tail interfaces
