ath10k: snoc: fix unbalanced clock error handling

Similar to regulator error handling, we should only start tearing down
the 'i - 1' clock when clock 'i' fails to enable. Otherwise, we might
end up with an unbalanced clock, where we never successfully enabled the
clock, but we try to disable it anyway.
