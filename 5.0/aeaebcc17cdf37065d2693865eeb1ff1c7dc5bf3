dmaengine: xilinx_dma: Remove __aligned attribute on zynqmp_dma_desc_ll

Clang warns:

drivers/dma/xilinx/zynqmp_dma.c:166:4: warning: attribute 'aligned' is
ignored, place it after "struct" to apply attribute to type declaration
[-Wignored-attributes]
}; __aligned(64)
   ^
./include/linux/compiler_types.h:200:38: note: expanded from macro
'__aligned'
                                               ^
1 warning generated.

As Nick pointed out in the previous version of this patch, the author
likely intended for this struct to be 8-byte (64-bit) aligned, not
64-byte, which is the default. Remove the hanging __aligned attribute.
