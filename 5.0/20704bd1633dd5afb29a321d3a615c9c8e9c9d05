erspan: build the header with the right proto according to erspan_ver

As said in draft-foschiano-erspan-03#section4:

   Different frame variants known as "ERSPAN Types" can be
   distinguished based on the GRE "Protocol Type" field value: Type I
   and II's value is 0x88BE while Type III's is 0x22EB [ETYPES].

So set it properly in erspan_xmit() according to erspan_ver. While at
it, also remove the unused parameter 'proto' in erspan_fb_xmit().
