net/bridge: Replace call_rcu_bh() and rcu_barrier_bh()

Now that call_rcu()'s callback is not invoked until after all bh-disable
regions of code have completed (in addition to explicitly marked
RCU read-side critical sections), call_rcu() can be used in place
of call_rcu_bh().  Similarly, rcu_barrier() can be used in place of
rcu_barrier_bh().  This commit therefore makes these changes.
