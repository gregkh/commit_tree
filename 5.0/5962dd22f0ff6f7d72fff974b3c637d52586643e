x86/intel/lpss: Make PCI dependency explicit

After commit

  5d32a66541c4 ("PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without CONFIG_PCI set")

dependencies on CONFIG_PCI that previously were satisfied implicitly
through dependencies on CONFIG_ACPI have to be specified directly. LPSS
code relies on PCI infrastructure but this dependency has not been
explicitly called out so do that.
