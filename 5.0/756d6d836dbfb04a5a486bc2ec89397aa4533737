MIPS: SiByte: Enable ZONE_DMA32 for LittleSur

The LittleSur board is marked for high memory support and therefore
clearly must provide a way to have enough memory installed for some to
be present outside the low 4GiB physical address range.  With the memory
map of the BCM1250 SOC it has been built around it means over 1GiB of
actual DRAM, as only the first 1GiB is mapped in the low 4GiB physical
address range[1].

Complement commit cce335ae47e2 ("[MIPS] 64-bit Sibyte kernels need
DMA32.") then and also enable ZONE_DMA32 for LittleSur.
