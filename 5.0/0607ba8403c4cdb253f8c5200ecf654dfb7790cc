srcu: Prevent __call_srcu() counter wrap with read-side critical section

Ever since cdf7abc4610a ("srcu: Allow use of Tiny/Tree SRCU from
both process and interrupt context"), it has been permissible
to use SRCU read-side critical sections in interrupt context.
This allows __call_srcu() to use SRCU read-side critical sections to
prevent a new SRCU grace period from ending before the call to either
srcu_funnel_gp_start() or srcu_funnel_exp_start completes, thus preventing
SRCU grace-period counter overflow during that time.

Note that this does not permit removal of the counter-wrap checks in
srcu_gp_end().  These check are necessary to handle the case where
a given CPU does not interact at all with SRCU for an extended time
period.

This commit therefore adds an SRCU read-side critical section to
__call_srcu() in order to prevent grace period counter wrap during
the funnel-locking process.
