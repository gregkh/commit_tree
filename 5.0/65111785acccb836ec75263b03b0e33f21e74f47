scsi: smartpqi: increase fw status register read timeout

Problem:
 - during the driver initialization, driver will poll fw
   for KERNEL_UP in a 30 seconds timeout.

 - if the firmware is not ready after 30 seconds,
   driver will not be loaded.

Fix:
 - change timeout from 30 seconds to 3 minutes.
