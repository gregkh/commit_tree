arm/arm64: KVM: Allow a VCPU to fully reset itself

The current kvm_psci_vcpu_on implementation will directly try to
manipulate the state of the VCPU to reset it.  However, since this is
not done on the thread that runs the VCPU, we can end up in a strangely
corrupted state when the source and target VCPUs are running at the same
time.

Fix this by factoring out all reset logic from the PSCI implementation
and forwarding the required information along with a request to the
target VCPU.
