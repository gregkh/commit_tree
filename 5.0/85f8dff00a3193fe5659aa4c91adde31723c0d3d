xfs: fix symbolic enum printing in ftrace output

ftrace's __print_symbolic() has a (very poorly documented) requirement
that any enum values used in the symbol to string translation table be
wrapped in a TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM so that the enum value can be encoded in
the ftrace ring buffer.  Fix this unsatisfied requirement.
