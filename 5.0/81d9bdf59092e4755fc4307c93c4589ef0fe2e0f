mtd: rawnand: qcom: fix memory corruption that causes panic

This patch fixes a memory corruption that occurred in the
qcom-nandc driver since it was converted to nand_scan().

On boot, an affected device will panic from a NPE at a weird place:
| Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0
| pgd = (ptrval)

The problem is that the nand_scan()'s qcom_nand_attach_chip callback
is updating the nandc->max_cwperpage from 1 to 4. This causes the
sg_init_table of clear_bam_transaction() in the driver's
qcom_nandc_block_bad() to memset much more than what was initially
allocated by alloc_bam_transaction().

This patch restores the old behavior by reallocating the shared bam
transaction alloc_bam_transaction() after the chip was identified,
but before mtd_device_parse_register() (which is an alias for
mtd_device_register() - see panic) gets called. This fixes the
corruption and the driver is working again.
