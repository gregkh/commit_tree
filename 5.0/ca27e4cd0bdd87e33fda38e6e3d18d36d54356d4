PM-runtime: Fix autosuspend_delay on 32bits arch

Cast autosuspend_delay to u64 to make sure that the full computation
of 'expires' or slack will be done in u64, even on 32bits arch.

Otherwise, any delay greater than 2^31 nsec can overflow if signed
32bits is used when converting delay from msec to nsec.

Fixes: 8234f6734c5d (PM-runtime: Switch autosuspend over to using hrtimers)
