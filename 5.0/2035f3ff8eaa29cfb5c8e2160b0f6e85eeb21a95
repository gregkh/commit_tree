netfilter: ebtables: compat: un-break 32bit setsockopt when no rules are present

Unlike ip(6)tables ebtables only counts user-defined chains.

The effect is that a 32bit ebtables binary on a 64bit kernel can do
'ebtables -N FOO' only after adding at least one rule, else the request
fails with -EINVAL.

This is a similar fix as done in
3f1e53abff84 ("netfilter: ebtables: don't attempt to allocate 0-sized compat array").
