Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Add support for regulator supplies

The Broadcom Bluetooth chips have two power inputs, VBAT and VDDIO.
The former provides overall power for the chip, while the latter powers
the I/O pins and buffers.

Model these two as regulator supplies, and let the driver manage them
in the same way as it does the clock supply.
