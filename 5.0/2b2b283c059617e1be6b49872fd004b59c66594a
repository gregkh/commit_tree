i3c: master: dw: fix mask operation by using the correct operator

The masking operation on status is using a bitwise 'or' rather than
a bitwise 'and' operator, and hence the result is always non-zero
which is probably not what is intended. Fix this by using the correct
operator.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1475523 ("Wrong operator used")
