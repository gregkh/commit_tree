ARM: dts: da850: fix interrupt numbers for clocksource

The timer interrupts specified in commit 3652e2741f42 ("ARM: dts:
da850: Add clocks") are wrong but since the current timer code
hard-codes them, the bug was never spotted.

This patch must go into stable since, once we introduce a proper
clocksource driver, devices with buggy device tree will stop booting.
