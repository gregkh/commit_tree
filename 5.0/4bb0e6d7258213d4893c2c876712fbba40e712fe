drm/sun4i: backend: add missing of_node_puts

The device node iterators perform an of_node_get on each
iteration, so a jump out of the loop requires an of_node_put.

Remote and port also have augmented reference counts, so drop them
on each iteration and at the end of the function, respectively.
Remote is only used for the address it contains, not for the
contents of that address, so the reference count can be dropped
immediately.

The semantic patch that fixes the first part of this problem is
as follows (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr):

// <smpl>
@@
expression root,e;
local idexpression child;
iterator name for_each_child_of_node;
@@

 for_each_available_child_of_node(root, child) {
   ... when != of_node_put(child)
       when != e = child
+  of_node_put(child);
?  break;
   ...
}
... when != child
// </smpl>
