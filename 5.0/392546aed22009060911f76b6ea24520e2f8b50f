blk-mq: separate number of hardware queues from nr_cpu_ids

With multiple maps, nr_cpu_ids is no longer the maximum number of
hardware queues we support on a given devices. The initializer of
the tag_set can have set ->nr_hw_queues larger than the available
number of CPUs, since we can exceed that with multiple queue maps.
