loop: Get rid of 'nested' acquisition of loop_ctl_mutex

The nested acquisition of loop_ctl_mutex (->lo_ctl_mutex back then) has
been introduced by commit f028f3b2f987e "loop: fix circular locking in
loop_clr_fd()" to fix lockdep complains about bd_mutex being acquired
after lo_ctl_mutex during partition rereading. Now that these are
properly fixed, let's stop fooling lockdep.
