pstore: Avoid duplicate call of persistent_ram_zap()

When initialing a prz, if invalid data is found (no PERSISTENT_RAM_SIG),
the function call path looks like this:

ramoops_init_prz ->
    persistent_ram_new -> persistent_ram_post_init -> persistent_ram_zap
    persistent_ram_zap

As we can see, persistent_ram_zap() is called twice.
We can avoid this by adding an option to persistent_ram_new(), and
only call persistent_ram_zap() when it is needed.
