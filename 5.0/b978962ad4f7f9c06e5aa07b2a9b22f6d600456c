blkcg: update blkg_lookup_create() to do locking

To know when to create a blkg, the general pattern is to do a
blkg_lookup() and if that fails, lock and do the lookup again, and if
that fails finally create. It doesn't make much sense for everyone who
wants to do creation to write this themselves.

This changes blkg_lookup_create() to do locking and implement this
pattern. The old blkg_lookup_create() is renamed to
__blkg_lookup_create().  If a call site wants to do its own error
handling or already owns the queue lock, they can use
__blkg_lookup_create(). This will be used in upcoming patches.
