tracing: Simplify creation and deletion of synthetic events

Since the event_mutex and synth_event_mutex ordering issue
is gone, we can skip existing event check when adding or
deleting events, and some redundant code in error path.

This changes release_all_synth_events() to abort the process
when it hits any error and returns the error code. It succeeds
only if it has no error.
