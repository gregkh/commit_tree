kdb: Don't back trace on a cpu that didn't round up

If you have a CPU that fails to round up and then run 'btc' you'll end
up crashing in kdb becaue we dereferenced NULL.  Let's add a check.
It's wise to also set the task to NULL when leaving the debugger so
that if we fail to round up on a later entry into the debugger we
won't backtrace a stale task.
