drm/i915: Move the engine->destroy() vfunc onto the engine

Make the engine responsible for cleaning itself up!

This removes the i915->gt.cleanup vfunc that has been annoying the
casual reader and myself for the last several years, and helps keep a
future patch to add more cleanup tidy.

v2: Assert that engine->destroy is set after the backend starts
allocating its own state.
