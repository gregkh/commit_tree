drm/modes: Make the whitelist more const

The commit 3764137906a5 ("drm/modes: Introduce a whitelist for the named
modes") introduced a whitelist in the named modes lookup code in order to
be a bit more robust.

However, even though the char pointers were made const, the array itself
was not. Let's fix that.
