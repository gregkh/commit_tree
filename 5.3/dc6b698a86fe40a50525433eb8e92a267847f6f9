PCI: sysfs: Ignore lockdep for remove attribute

With CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y, using sysfs to remove a bridge with a device
below it causes a lockdep warning, e.g.,

  # echo 1 > /sys/class/pci_bus/0000:00/device/0000:00:00.0/remove
  ============================================
  WARNING: possible recursive locking detected
  ...
  pci_bus 0000:01: busn_res: [bus 01] is released

The remove recursively removes the subtree below the bridge.  Each call
uses a different lock so there's no deadlock, but the locks were all
created with the same lockdep key so the lockdep checker can't tell them
apart.

Mark the "remove" sysfs attribute with __ATTR_IGNORE_LOCKDEP() as it is
safe to ignore the lockdep check between different "remove" kernfs
instances.

There's discussion about a similar issue in USB at [1], which resulted in
356c05d58af0 ("sysfs: get rid of some lockdep false positives") and
e9b526fe7048 ("i2c: suppress lockdep warning on delete_device"), which do
basically the same thing for USB "remove" and i2c "delete_device" files.
