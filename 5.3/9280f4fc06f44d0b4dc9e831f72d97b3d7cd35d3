ath10k: Fix the wrong value of enums for wmi tlv stats id

The enum value for WMI_TLV_STAT_PDEV, WMI_TLV_STAT_VDEV
and WMI_TLV_STAT_PEER is wrong, due to which the vdev stats
are not received from firmware in wmi_update_stats event.

Fix the enum values for above stats to receive all stats
from firmware in WMI_TLV_UPDATE_STATS_EVENTID.

Tested HW: WCN3990
Tested FW: WLAN.HL.3.1-00784-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
