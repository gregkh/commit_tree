perf time-utils: Treat time ranges consistently

Currently, options allow only 1 explicit (non-percentage) time range.
In preparation for adding support for multiple explicit time ranges,
treat time ranges consistently.

Instead of treating some time ranges as inclusive and some as excluding
the end time, treat all time ranges as inclusive. This is only a 1
nanosecond change but is necessary to treat multiple explicit time
ranges in a consistent manner.

Note, there is a later patch that adds a test for time-utils.
