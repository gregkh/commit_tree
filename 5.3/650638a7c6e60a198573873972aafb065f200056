ipv4: fix confirm_addr_indev() when enable route_localnet

When arp_ignore=3, the NIC won't reply for scope host addresses, but
if enable route_locanet, we need to reply ip address with head 127 and
scope RT_SCOPE_HOST.

Fixes: d0daebc3d622 ("ipv4: Add interface option to enable routing of 127.0.0.0/8")
