drm/i915: Don't skip audio enable if ELD is bogus

We've already committed to enabling audio when intel_audio_codec_enable()
is called. We can't back out even if the ELD has turned sour in the
meantime. So just spew some debug log and plow ahead. Otherwise the
state checker gets unhappy when audio isn't enabled when it is
expected to be.

I suppose we really ought to precompute the ELD as well, but
let's just toss in a FIXME for the future.
