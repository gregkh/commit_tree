kbuild: fix missed rebuild of modules.builtin

Unlike modules.order, modules.builtin is not rebuilt every time.
Once modules.builtin is created, it will not be updated until
auto.conf or tristate.conf is changed.

So, it does not  notice a change in Makefile, for example, the rename
of modules.

Kbuild must always descend into directories for modules.builtin too.
