PCI: tegra: Disable AFI dynamic clock gating

Outstanding write counter in AFI is used to generate idle signal to
dynamically gate the AFI clock. When there are 32 outstanding writes
from AFI to memory, the outstanding write counter overflows and
indicates that there are "0" outstanding write transactions.

When memory controller is under heavy load, write completions to AFI
gets delayed and AFI write counter overflows. This causes AFI clock gating
even when there are outstanding transactions towards memory controller
resulting in a system hang.

Disable dynamic clock gating of AFI clock to avoid system hang.

CLKEN_OVERRIDE bit is not defined in Tegra20 and Tegra30, however
programming this bit doesn't cause any side effects. Program this
bit for all Tegra SoCs to avoid conditional check.
