Revert "Revert "mm, thp: consolidate THP gfp handling into alloc_hugepage_direct_gfpmask""

Patch series "reapply: relax __GFP_THISNODE for MADV_HUGEPAGE mappings".

The fixes for what was originally reported as "pathological THP
behavior" we rightfully reverted to be sure not to introduced
regressions at end of a merge window after a severe regression report
from the kernel bot.  We can safely re-apply them now that we had time
to analyze the problem.

The mm process worked fine, because the good fixes were eventually
committed upstream without excessive delay.

The regression reported by the kernel bot however forced us to revert
the good fixes to be sure not to introduce regressions and to give us
the time to analyze the issue further.  The silver lining is that this
extra time allowed to think more at this issue and also plan for a
future direction to improve things further in terms of THP NUMA
locality.

This patch (of 2):

This reverts commit 356ff8a9a78fb35d ("Revert "mm, thp: consolidate THP
gfp handling into alloc_hugepage_direct_gfpmask").  So it reapplies
89c83fb539f954 ("mm, thp: consolidate THP gfp handling into
alloc_hugepage_direct_gfpmask").

Consolidation of the THP allocation flags at the same place was meant to
be a clean up to easier handle otherwise scattered code which is
imposing a maintenance burden.  There were no real problems observed
with the gfp mask consolidation but the reversion was rushed through
without a larger consensus regardless.

This patch brings the consolidation back because this should make the
long term maintainability easier as well as it should allow future
changes to be less error prone.
