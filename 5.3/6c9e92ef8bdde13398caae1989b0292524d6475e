dt-bindings: virtio: Add virtio-pci-iommu node

Some systems implement virtio-iommu as a PCI endpoint. The operating
system needs to discover the relationship between IOMMU and masters long
before the PCI endpoint gets probed. Add a PCI child node to describe the
virtio-iommu device.

The virtio-pci-iommu is conceptually split between a PCI programming
interface and a translation component on the parent bus. The latter
doesn't have a node in the device tree. The virtio-pci-iommu node
describes both, by linking the PCI endpoint to "iommus" property of DMA
master nodes and to "iommu-map" properties of bus nodes.
