/proc/<pid>/cmdline: remove all the special cases

Start off with a clean slate that only reads exactly from arg_start to
arg_end, without any oddities.  This simplifies the code and in the
process removes the case that caused us to potentially leak an
uninitialized byte from the temporary kernel buffer.

Note that in order to start from scratch with an understandable base,
this simplifies things _too_ much, and removes all the legacy logic to
handle setproctitle() having changed the argument strings.

We'll add back those special cases very differently in the next commit.
