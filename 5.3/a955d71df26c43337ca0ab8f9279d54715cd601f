net: hns3: fix avoid unnecessary resetting for the H/W errors which do not require reset

HNS does not need to be reset when errors occur in some bits.
However presently the HNAE3_FUNC_RESET is set in this case and
as a result the default_reset is done when these errors are reported.
This patch fix this issue. Also patch does some optimization
in setting the reset level for the error recovery.
