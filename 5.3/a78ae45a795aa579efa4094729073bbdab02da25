PCI: PM: Simplify bus-level hibernation callbacks

After a previous change causing all runtime-suspended PCI devices
to be resumed before creating a snapshot image of memory during
hibernation, it is not necessary to worry about the case in which
them might be left in runtime-suspend any more, so get rid of the
code related to that from bus-level PCI hibernation callbacks.
