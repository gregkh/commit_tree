PCI: altera: Fix configuration type based on secondary number

Stratix 10 PCIe controller does not support Type 1 to Type 0 conversion
as previous version (V1) does so the PCIe controller configuration
mechanism needs to send Type 0 config TLP if the target bus number
matches with the secondary bus number.

Implement a function to form a TLP header that depends on the PCIe
controller version, so that the header can be formed according to
specific host controller HW internals, fixing the type conversion issue.
