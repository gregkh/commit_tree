drm/amd/display: add global master update lock for DCN2

[why]
when an update programming sequence requires both
front end and back end pipe to be updated synchronously,
a global update lock needs to be set to ensure that
we don't get a frame with only front end update but
not the back end update.

[how]
setup global lock parameters on enable_stream_timing.
enable global lock when pipe_control_lock_global is called.
disable global lock when pipe_control_lock is called.
