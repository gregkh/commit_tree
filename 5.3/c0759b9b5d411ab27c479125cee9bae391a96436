firmware: arm_scmi: update rate_discrete in clock_describe_rates_get

The boolean rate_discrete needs to be assigned to clk->rate_discrete,
so that clock driver can distinguish between the continuous range and
discrete rates. It uses this in scmi_clk_round_rate could get the
rounded value if it's a continuous range.
