kheaders: remove meaningless -R option of 'ls'

The -R option of 'ls' is supposed to be used for directories.

   -R, --recursive
          list subdirectories recursively

Since 'find ... -type f' only matches to regular files, we do not
expect directories passed to the 'ls' command here.

Giving -R is harmless at least, but unneeded.
