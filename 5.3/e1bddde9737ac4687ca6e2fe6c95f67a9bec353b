ath10k: add struct for high latency PN replay protection

Add the struct for PN replay protection and fragment packet
handler.

Also fix the bitmask of HTT_RX_DESC_HL_INFO_MCAST_BCAST to match what's currently
used by SDIO firmware. The defines are not used yet so it's safe to modify
them. Remove the conflicting HTT_RX_DESC_HL_INFO_FRAGMENT as
it's not either used in ath10k.

Tested on QCA6174 SDIO with firmware WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00007-QCARMSWP-1.
