coresight: tmc: Clean up device specific data

In preparation to use a consistent device naming scheme,
clean up the device link tracking in replicator driver.
Use the "coresight" device instead of the "real" parent device
for all internal purposes. All other requests (e.g, power management,
DMA operations) must use the "real" device which is the parent device.

Since the CATU driver also uses the TMC-SG infrastructure, update
the callers to ensure they pass the appropriate device argument
for the tables.
