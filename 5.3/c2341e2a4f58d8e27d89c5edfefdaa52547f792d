kbuild: save $(strip ...) for calling if_changed and friends

The string returned by $(filter-out ...) does not contain any leading
or trailing spaces.

With the previous commit, 'any-prereq' no longer contains any
excessive spaces.

Nor does 'cmd-check' since it expands to a $(filter-out ...) call.

So, only the space that matters is the one between 'any-prereq'
and 'cmd-check'.

By removing it from the code, we can save $(strip ...) evaluation.
This refactoring is possible because $(any-prereq)$(cmd-check) is only
passed to the first argument of $(if ...), so we are only interested
in whether or not it is empty.
