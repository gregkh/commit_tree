drbd: dynamically allocate shash descriptor

Building with clang and KASAN, we get a warning about an overly large
stack frame on 32-bit architectures:

drivers/block/drbd/drbd_receiver.c:921:31: error: stack frame size of 1280 bytes in function 'conn_connect'
      [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

We already allocate other data dynamically in this function, so
just do the same for the shash descriptor, which makes up most of
this memory.
