acpi/arm64: ignore 5.1 FADTs that are reported as 5.0

Some Qualcomm Snapdragon based laptops built to run Microsoft Windows
are clearly ACPI 5.1 based, given that that is the first ACPI revision
that supports ARM, and introduced the FADT 'arm_boot_flags' field,
which has a non-zero field on those systems.

So in these cases, infer from the ARM boot flags that the FADT must be
5.1 or later, and treat it as 5.1.
