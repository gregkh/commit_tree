ipv6: Move pcpu cached routes to fib6_nh

rt6_info are specific instances of a fib entry and are tied to a
device and gateway - ie., a nexthop. Before nexthop objects, IPv6 fib
entries have separate fib6_info for each nexthop in a multipath route,
so the location of the pcpu cache in the fib6_info struct worked.
However, with nexthop objects a fib6_info can point to a set of nexthops
(yet another alignment of ipv6 with ipv4). Accordingly, the pcpu
cache needs to be moved to the fib6_nh struct so the cached entries
are local to the nexthop specification used to create the rt6_info.

Initialization and free of the pcpu entries moved to fib6_nh_init and
fib6_nh_release.

Change in location only, from fib6_info down to fib6_nh; no other
functional change intended.
