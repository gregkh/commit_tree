powerpc/pseries: avoid blocking in irq when queuing hotplug events

A couple of bugs in queue_hotplug_event():

1. Unchecked kmalloc result which could lead to an oops.
2. Use of GFP_KERNEL allocations in interrupt context (this code's
   only caller is ras_hotplug_interrupt()).

Use kmemdup to avoid open-coding the allocation+copy and check for
failure; use GFP_ATOMIC for both allocations.

Ultimately it probably would be better to avoid or reduce allocations
in this path if possible.
