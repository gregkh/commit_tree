keys: Fix description size

The maximum key description size is 4095.  Commit f771fde82051 ("keys:
Simplify key description management") inadvertantly reduced that to 255
and made sizes between 256 and 4095 work weirdly, and any size whereby
size & 255 == 0 would cause an assertion in __key_link_begin() at the
following line:

	BUG_ON(index_key->desc_len == 0);

This can be fixed by simply increasing the size of desc_len in struct
keyring_index_key to a u16.

Note the argument length test in keyutils only checked empty
descriptions and descriptions with a size around the limit (ie.  4095)
and not for all the values in between, so it missed this.  This has been
addressed and

now exhaustively tests all possible lengths of type, description and
payload and then some.

The assertion failure looks something like:
