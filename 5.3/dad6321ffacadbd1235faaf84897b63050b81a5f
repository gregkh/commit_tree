KVM: arm64: Re-mask SError after the one instruction window

KVM consumes any SError that were pending during guest exit with a
dsb/isb and unmasking SError. It currently leaves SError unmasked for
the rest of world-switch.

This means any SError that occurs during this part of world-switch
will cause a hyp-panic. We'd much prefer it to remain pending until
we return to the host.
