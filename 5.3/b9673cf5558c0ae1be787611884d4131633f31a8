net/mlx5e: Share the XDP SQ for XDP_TX between RQs

Put the XDP SQ that is used for XDP_TX into the channel. It used to be a
part of the RQ, but with introduction of AF_XDP there will be one more
RQ that could share the same XDP SQ. This patch is a preparation for
that change.

Separate XDP_TX statistics per RQ were implemented in one of the previous
patches.
