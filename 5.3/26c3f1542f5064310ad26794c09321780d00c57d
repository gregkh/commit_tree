ALSA: compress: Prevent bypasses of set_params

Currently, whilst in SNDRV_PCM_STATE_OPEN it is possible to call
snd_compr_stop, snd_compr_drain and snd_compr_partial_drain, which
allow a transition to SNDRV_PCM_STATE_SETUP. The stream should
only be able to move to the setup state once it has received a
SNDRV_COMPRESS_SET_PARAMS ioctl. Fix this issue by not allowing
those ioctls whilst in the open state.
