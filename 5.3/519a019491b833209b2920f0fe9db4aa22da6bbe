drm/i915/hangcheck: Replace hangcheck.seqno with RING_HEAD

After realising we need to sample RING_START to detect context switches
from preemption events that do not allow for the seqno to advance, we
can also realise that the seqno itself is just a distance along the ring
and so can be replaced by sampling RING_HEAD.

v2: Bonus comment for the mystery separate CS_STALL before MI_USER_INTERRUPT
