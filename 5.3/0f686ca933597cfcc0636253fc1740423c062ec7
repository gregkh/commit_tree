Revert "mmc: sdhci-tegra: drop ->get_ro() implementation"

The WRITE_PROTECT bit is always in a "protected mode" on Tegra and
WP-GPIO state need to be used instead. In a case of the GPIO absence,
write-enable should be assumed. External SD is writable once again as
a result of this patch because the offending commit changed behaviour for
the case of a missing WP-GPIO to fall back to WRITE_PROTECT bit-checking,
which is incorrect for Tegra.
