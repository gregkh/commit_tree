ring-buffer: Remove HAVE_64BIT_ALIGNED_ACCESS

Commit c19fa94a8fed ("Add HAVE_64BIT_ALIGNED_ACCESS") added the config for
architectures that required 64bit aligned access for all 64bit words. As
the ftrace ring buffer stores data on 4 byte alignment, this config option
was used to force it to store data on 8 byte alignment to make sure the data
being stored and written directly into the ring buffer was 8 byte aligned as
it would cause issues trying to write an 8 byte word on a 4 not 8 byte
aligned memory location.

But with the removal of the metag architecture, which was the only
architecture to use this, there is no architecture supported by Linux that
requires 8 byte aligne access for all 8 byte words (4 byte alignment is good
enough). Removing this config can simplify the code a bit.
