ALSA: usb-audio: Fix a stack buffer overflow bug in check_input_term

`check_input_term` recursively calls itself with input from
device side (e.g., uac_input_terminal_descriptor.bCSourceID)
as argument (id). In `check_input_term`, if `check_input_term`
is called with the same `id` argument as the caller, it triggers
endless recursive call, resulting kernel space stack overflow.

This patch fixes the bug by adding a bitmap to `struct mixer_build`
to keep track of the checked ids and stop the execution if some id
has been checked (similar to how parse_audio_unit handles unitid
argument).
