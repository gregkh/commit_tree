net: fix bpf_xdp_adjust_head regression for generic-XDP

When generic-XDP was moved to a later processing step by commit
458bf2f224f0 ("net: core: support XDP generic on stacked devices.")
a regression was introduced when using bpf_xdp_adjust_head.

The issue is that after this commit the skb->network_header is now
changed prior to calling generic XDP and not after. Thus, if the header
is changed by XDP (via bpf_xdp_adjust_head), then skb->network_header
also need to be updated again.  Fix by calling skb_reset_network_header().
