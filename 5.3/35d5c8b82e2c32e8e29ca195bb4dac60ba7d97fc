IB/hfi1: Unsafe PSN checking for TID RDMA READ Resp packet

When processing a TID RDMA READ RESP packet that causes KDETH EFLAGS
errors, the packet's IB PSN is checked against qp->s_last_psn and
qp->s_psn without the protection of qp->s_lock, which is not safe.

This patch fixes the issue by acquiring qp->s_lock first.
