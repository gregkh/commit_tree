mfd: bd718x7: Make power button press duration configurable

Allow overwriting the values in BD718XX_REG_PWRONCONFIG0 and
BD718XX_REG_PWRONCONFIG1 via devicetree. Read values in milliseconds and
attempt to round them to something supported by the hardware.

Keep existing values (from bootloader or OTP) if property is not
present.
