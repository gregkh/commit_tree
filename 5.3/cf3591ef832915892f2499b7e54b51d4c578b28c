Revert "dm bufio: fix deadlock with loop device"

Revert the commit bd293d071ffe65e645b4d8104f9d8fe15ea13862. The proper
fix has been made available with commit d0a255e795ab ("loop: set
PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO for the worker thread").

Note that the fix offered by commit bd293d071ffe doesn't really prevent
the deadlock from occuring - if we look at the stacktrace reported by
Junxiao Bi, we see that it hangs in bit_wait_io and not on the mutex -
i.e. it has already successfully taken the mutex. Changing the mutex
from mutex_lock to mutex_trylock won't help with deadlocks that happen
afterwards.
