KVM: nVMX: Update vmcs12 for MSR_IA32_CR_PAT when it's written

As alluded to by the TODO comment, KVM unconditionally intercepts writes
to the PAT MSR.  In the unlikely event that L1 allows L2 to write L1's
PAT directly but saves L2's PAT on VM-Exit, update vmcs12 when L2 writes
the PAT.  This eliminates the need to VMREAD the value from vmcs02 on
VM-Exit as vmcs12 is already up to date in all situations.
