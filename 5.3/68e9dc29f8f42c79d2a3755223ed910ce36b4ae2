locking/lockdep: Check redundant dependency only when CONFIG_LOCKDEP_SMALL

As Peter has put it all sound and complete for the cause, I simply quote:

"It (check_redundant) was added for cross-release (which has since been
reverted) which would generate a lot of redundant links (IIRC) but
having it makes the reports more convoluted -- basically, if we had an
A-B-C relation, then A-C will not be added to the graph because it is
already covered. This then means any report will include B, even though
a shorter cycle might have been possible."

This would increase the number of direct dependencies. For a simple workload
(make clean; reboot; make vmlinux -j8), the data looks like this:

 CONFIG_LOCKDEP_SMALL: direct dependencies:                  6926

!CONFIG_LOCKDEP_SMALL: direct dependencies:                  9052    (+30.7%)
