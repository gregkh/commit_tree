dt-bindings: hwlock: Update OMAP binding for TI K3 SoCs

The TI K3 AM65x and J721E family of SoCs have a HwSpinlock IP that
is similar to the existing HwSpinlock IP present in OMAP architecture
based SoCs with minor differences. Update the existing OMAP HwSpinlock
binding for this IP on TI K3 AM65x and J721E SoCs. The same compatible
from AM65x SoCs is reused for J721E SoCs.
