drm/vmwgfx: Assign eviction priorities to resources

TTM provides a means to assign eviction priorities to buffer object. This
means that all buffer objects with a lower priority will be evicted first
on memory pressure.
Use this to make sure surfaces and in particular non-dirty surfaces are
evicted first. Evicting in particular shaders, cotables and contexts imply
a significant performance hit on vmwgfx, so make sure these resources are
evicted last.
Some buffer objects are sub-allocated in user-space which means we can have
many resources attached to a single buffer object or resource. In that case
the buffer object is given the highest priority of the attached resources.
