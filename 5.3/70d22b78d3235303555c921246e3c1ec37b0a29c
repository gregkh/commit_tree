soc: qcom: apr: Don't use reg for domain id

The reg property represents the address and size on the bus that a
device lives, but for APR the parent is a rpmsg bus, which does not have
numerical addresses. Simply defining #address/#size-cells to 1 and 0,
respectively, to silence the compiler is not an appropriate solution.

Replace the use of "reg" with an APR specific property.
