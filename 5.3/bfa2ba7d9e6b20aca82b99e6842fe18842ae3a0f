crypto: crypto4xx - fix AES CTR blocksize value

This patch fixes a issue with crypto4xx's ctr(aes) that was
discovered by libcapi's kcapi-enc-test.sh test.

The some of the ctr(aes) encryptions test were failing on the
non-power-of-two test:

kcapi-enc - Error: encryption failed with error 0
kcapi-enc - Error: decryption failed with error 0
[FAILED: 32-bit - 5.1.0-rc1+] 15 bytes: STDIN / STDOUT enc test (128 bits):
original file (1d100e..cc96184c) and generated file (e3b0c442..1b7852b855)
[FAILED: 32-bit - 5.1.0-rc1+] 15 bytes: STDIN / STDOUT enc test (128 bits)
(openssl generated CT): original file (e3b0..5) and generated file (3..8e)
[PASSED: 32-bit - 5.1.0-rc1+] 15 bytes: STDIN / STDOUT enc test (128 bits)
(openssl generated PT)
[FAILED: 32-bit - 5.1.0-rc1+] 15 bytes: STDIN / STDOUT enc test (password):
original file (1d1..84c) and generated file (e3b..852b855)

But the 16, 32, 512, 65536 tests always worked.

Thankfully, this isn't a hidden hardware problem like previously,
instead this turned out to be a copy and paste issue.

With this patch, all the tests are passing with and
kcapi-enc-test.sh gives crypto4xx's a clean bill of health:
 "Number of failures: 0" :).
