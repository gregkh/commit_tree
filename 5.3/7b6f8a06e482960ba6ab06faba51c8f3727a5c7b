kvm: x86: Move kvm_set_mmio_spte_mask() from x86.c to mmu.c

As a prerequisite to fix several SPTE reserved bits related calculation
errors caused by MKTME, which requires kvm_set_mmio_spte_mask() to use
local static variable defined in mmu.c.

Also move call site of kvm_set_mmio_spte_mask() from kvm_arch_init() to
kvm_mmu_module_init() so that kvm_set_mmio_spte_mask() can be static.
