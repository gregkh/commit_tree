mm: don't clear ->mapping in hmm_devmem_free

->mapping isn't even used by HMM users, and the field at the same offset
in the zone_device part of the union is declared as pad.  (Which btw is
rather confusing, as DAX uses ->pgmap and ->mapping from two different
sides of the union, but DAX doesn't use hmm_devmem_free).
