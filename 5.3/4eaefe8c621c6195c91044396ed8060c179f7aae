nvme-pci: Allow PCI bus-level PM to be used if ASPM is disabled

One of the modifications made by commit d916b1be94b6 ("nvme-pci: use
host managed power state for suspend") was adding a pci_save_state()
call to nvme_suspend() so as to instruct the PCI bus type to leave
devices handled by the nvme driver in D0 during suspend-to-idle.
That was done with the assumption that ASPM would transition the
device's PCIe link into a low-power state when the device became
inactive.  However, if ASPM is disabled for the device, its PCIe
link will stay in L0 and in that case commit d916b1be94b6 is likely
to cause the energy used by the system while suspended to increase.

Namely, if the device in question works in accordance with the PCIe
specification, putting it into D3hot causes its PCIe link to go to
L1 or L2/L3 Ready, which is lower-power than L0.  Since the energy
used by the system while suspended depends on the state of its PCIe
link (as a general rule, the lower-power the state of the link, the
less energy the system will use), putting the device into D3hot
during suspend-to-idle should be more energy-efficient that leaving
it in D0 with disabled ASPM.

For this reason, avoid leaving NVMe devices with disabled ASPM in D0
during suspend-to-idle.  Instead, shut them down entirely and let
the PCI bus type put them into D3.
