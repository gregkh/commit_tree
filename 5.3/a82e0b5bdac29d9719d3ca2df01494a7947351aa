net/mlx5: Added MCQI and MCQS registers' description to ifc

Given a fw component index, the MCQI register allows us to query
this component's information (e.g. its version and capabilities).

Given a fw component index, the MCQS register allows us to query the
status of a fw component, including its type and state
(e.g. PRESET/IN_USE).
It can be used to find the index of a component of a specific type, by
sequentially increasing the component index, and querying each time the
type of the returned component.
If max component index is reached, 'last_index_flag' is set by the HCA.

These registers' description was added to query the running and pending
fw version of the HCA.
