btrfs: don't assume ordered sums to be 4 bytes

BTRFS has the implicit assumption that a checksum in btrfs_orderd_sums
is 4 bytes. While this is true for CRC32C, it is not for any other
checksum.

Change the data type to be a byte array and adjust loop index
calculation accordingly.

This includes moving the adjustment of 'index' by 'ins_size' in
btrfs_csum_file_blocks() before dividing 'ins_size' by the checksum
size, because before this patch the 'sums' member of 'struct
btrfs_ordered_sum' was 4 Bytes in size and afterwards it is only one
byte.
