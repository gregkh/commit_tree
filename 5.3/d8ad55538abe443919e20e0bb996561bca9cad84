dma-direct: don't truncate dma_required_mask to bus addressing capabilities

The dma required_mask needs to reflect the actual addressing capabilities
needed to handle the whole system RAM. When truncated down to the bus
addressing capabilities dma_addressing_limited() will incorrectly signal
no limitations for devices which are restricted by the bus_dma_mask.
