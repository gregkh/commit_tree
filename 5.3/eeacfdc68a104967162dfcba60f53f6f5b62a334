fscrypt: clean up some BUG_ON()s in block encryption/decryption

Replace some BUG_ON()s with WARN_ON_ONCE() and returning an error code,
and move the check for len divisible by FS_CRYPTO_BLOCK_SIZE into
fscrypt_crypt_block() so that it's done for both encryption and
decryption, not just encryption.
