spi: tegra114: add support for hw based cs

Tegra SPI controller supports both HW and SW based CS control
for SPI transfers.

This patch adds support for HW based CS control where CS is driven
to active state during the transfer and is driven inactive at the
end of the transfer directly by the HW.

This patch enables the use of HW based CS only for single transfers
without cs_change request.
