tty: serial: msm_serial: avoid system lockup condition

The function msm_wait_for_xmitr can be taken with interrupts
disabled. In order to avoid a potential system lockup - demonstrated
under stress testing conditions on SoC QCS404/5 - make sure we wait
for a bounded amount of time.

Tested on SoC QCS404.
