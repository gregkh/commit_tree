um: fix time travel mode

Unfortunately, my build fix for when time travel mode isn't
enabled broke time travel mode, because I forgot that we need
to use the timer time after the timer has been marked disabled,
and thus need to leave the time stored instead of zeroing it.

Fix that by splitting the inline into two, so we can call only
the _mode() one in the relevant code path.
