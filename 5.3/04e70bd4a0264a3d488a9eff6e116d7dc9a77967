nvme-multipath: do not select namespaces which are about to be removed

nvme_ns_remove() will first set the NVME_NS_REMOVING flag before removing
it from the list at the very last step.
So to avoid selecting a namespace in nvme_find_path() which is about to be
removed check the NVME_NS_REMOVING flag, too, when selecting a new path.
