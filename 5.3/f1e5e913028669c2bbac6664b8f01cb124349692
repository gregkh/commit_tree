drm/amdgpu: sort probed modes before adding common modes

[Why]
There are monitors which can have more than one preferred mode
set. There are chances in these monitors that if common modes are
added in function amdgpu_dm_connector_add_common_modes(), these
common modes can be calculated with different preferred mode than
the one used in function decide_crtc_timing_for_drm_display_mode().
The preferred mode can be different because after common modes
are added, the mode list is sorted and this changes the order of
preferred modes in the list. The first mode in the list with
preferred flag set is selected as preferred mode. Due to this the
preferred mode selected varies.
If same preferred mode is not selected in common mode calculation
and crtc timing, then during mode set instead of setting preferred
timing, common mode timing will be applied which can cause "out of
range" message in the monitor with monitor blanking out.

[How]
Sort the modes before adding common modes. The same sorting function
is called during common mode addition and deciding crtc timing.
