arm64: tegra: Fix AGIC register range

The Tegra AGIC interrupt controller is an ARM GIC400 interrupt
controller. Per the ARM GIC device-tree binding, the first address
region is for the GIC distributor registers and the second address
region is for the GIC CPU interface registers. The address space for
the distributor registers is 4kB, but currently this is incorrectly
defined as 8kB for the Tegra AGIC and overlaps with the CPU interface
registers. Correct the address space for the distributor to be 4kB.
