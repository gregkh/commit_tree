arm64/mm: Identify user instruction aborts

We don't currently set the FAULT_FLAG_INSTRUCTION mm flag for EL0
instruction aborts. This has no functional impact, as we don't override
arch_vma_access_permitted(), and the default implementation always returns
true. However, it would be helpful to provide the flag so that it can be
consumed by tracepoints such as dax_pmd_fault.

This patch sets the FAULT_FLAG_INSTRUCTION flag for EL0 instruction aborts.
