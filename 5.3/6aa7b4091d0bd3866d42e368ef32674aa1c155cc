ASoC: fsl: mpc8610_hpcd/p1022_ds/p1022_rdk: use modern dai_link style

ASoC is now supporting modern style dai_link
(= snd_soc_dai_link_component) for CPU/Codec/Platform.
This patch switches to use it.

mpc8610_hpcd/p1022_ds/p1022_rdk are sharing fsl_asoc_get_dma_channel()
which setups platform. We need to update these by 1 patch.
