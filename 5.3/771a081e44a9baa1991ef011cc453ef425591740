Input: alps - fix a mismatch between a condition check and its comment

In the function alps_is_cs19_trackpoint(), we check if the param[1] is
in the 0x20~0x2f range, but the code we wrote for this checking is not
correct:
(param[1] & 0x20) does not mean param[1] is in the range of 0x20~0x2f,
it also means the param[1] is in the range of 0x30~0x3f, 0x60~0x6f...

Now fix it with a new condition checking ((param[1] & 0xf0) == 0x20).
