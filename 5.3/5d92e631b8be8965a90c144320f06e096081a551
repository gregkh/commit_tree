net/tls: partially revert fix transition through disconnect with close

Looks like we were slightly overzealous with the shutdown()
cleanup. Even though the sock->sk_state can reach CLOSED again,
socket->state will not got back to SS_UNCONNECTED once
connections is ESTABLISHED. Meaning we will see EISCONN if
we try to reconnect, and EINVAL if we try to listen.

Only listen sockets can be shutdown() and reused, but since
ESTABLISHED sockets can never be re-connected() or used for
listen() we don't need to try to clean up the ULP state early.
