locking/rwsem: Implement a new locking scheme

The current way of using various reader, writer and waiting biases
in the rwsem code are confusing and hard to understand. I have to
reread the rwsem count guide in the rwsem-xadd.c file from time to
time to remind myself how this whole thing works. It also makes the
rwsem code harder to be optimized.

To make rwsem more sane, a new locking scheme similar to the one in
qrwlock is now being used.  The atomic long count has the following
bit definitions:

  Bit  0   - writer locked bit
  Bit  1   - waiters present bit
  Bits 2-7 - reserved for future extension
  Bits 8-X - reader count (24/56 bits)

The cmpxchg instruction is now used to acquire the write lock. The read
lock is still acquired with xadd instruction, so there is no change here.
This scheme will allow up to 16M/64P active readers which should be
more than enough. We can always use some more reserved bits if necessary.

With that change, we can deterministically know if a rwsem has been
write-locked. Looking at the count alone, however, one cannot determine
for certain if a rwsem is owned by readers or not as the readers that
set the reader count bits may be in the process of backing out. So we
still need the reader-owned bit in the owner field to be sure.

With a locking microbenchmark running on 5.1 based kernel, the total
locking rates (in kops/s) of the benchmark on a 8-socket 120-core
IvyBridge-EX system before and after the patch were as follows:

                  Before Patch      After Patch
   # of Threads  wlock    rlock    wlock    rlock
   ------------  -----    -----    -----    -----
        1        30,659   31,341   31,055   31,283
        2         8,909   16,457    9,884   17,659
        4         9,028   15,823    8,933   20,233
        8         8,410   14,212    7,230   17,140
       16         8,217   25,240    7,479   24,607

The locking rates of the benchmark on a Power8 system were as follows:

                  Before Patch      After Patch
   # of Threads  wlock    rlock    wlock    rlock
   ------------  -----    -----    -----    -----
        1        12,963   13,647   13,275   13,601
        2         7,570   11,569    7,902   10,829
        4         5,232    5,516    5,466    5,435
        8         5,233    3,386    5,467    3,168

The locking rates of the benchmark on a 2-socket ARM64 system were
as follows:

                  Before Patch      After Patch
   # of Threads  wlock    rlock    wlock    rlock
   ------------  -----    -----    -----    -----
        1        21,495   21,046   21,524   21,074
        2         5,293   10,502    5,333   10,504
        4         5,325   11,463    5,358   11,631
        8         5,391   11,712    5,470   11,680

The performance are roughly the same before and after the patch. There
are run-to-run variations in performance. Runs with higher variances
usually have higher throughput.
