ocfs2: use kmemdup rather than duplicating its implementation

kmemdup is introduced to duplicate a region of memory in a neat way.

Rather than kmalloc/kzalloc + memcpy, which the programmer needs to
write the size twice (sometimes lead to mistakes), kmemdup improves
readability, leads to smaller code and also reduce the chances of
mistakes.

Suggestion to use kmemdup rather than using kmalloc/kzalloc + memcpy.
