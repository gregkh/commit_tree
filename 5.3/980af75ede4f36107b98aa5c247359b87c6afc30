thermal/drivers/core: Add init section table for self-encapsulation

Currently the governors are declared in their respective files but they
export their [un]register functions which in turn call the [un]register
governors core's functions. That implies a cyclic dependency which is
not desirable. There is a way to self-encapsulate the governors by letting
them to declare themselves in a __init section table.

Define the table in the asm generic linker description like the other
tables and provide the specific macros to deal with.
