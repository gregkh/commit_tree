move mount_capable() calls to vfs_get_tree()

sget_fc() is called only from ->get_tree() instances and
the only instance not calling it is legacy_get_tree(),
which calls mount_capable() directly.

In all sget_fc() callers the checks could be moved to the
very beginning of ->get_tree() - ->user_ns is not changed
in between.  So lifting the checks to the only caller of
->get_tree() is OK.
