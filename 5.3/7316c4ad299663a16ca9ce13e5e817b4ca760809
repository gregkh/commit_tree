drm/amd/display: Reset planes for color management changes

[Why]
For commits with allow_modeset=false and CRTC degamma changes the planes
aren't reset. This results in incorrect rendering.

[How]
Reset the planes when color management has changed on the CRTC.
Technically this will include regamma changes as well, but it doesn't
really after legacy userspace since those commit with
allow_modeset=true.
