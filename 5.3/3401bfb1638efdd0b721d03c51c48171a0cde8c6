ipv6/route: Don't match on fc_nh_id if not set in ip6_route_del()

If fc_nh_id isn't set, we shouldn't try to match against it. This
actually matters just for the RTF_CACHE below (where this case is
already handled): if iproute2 gets a route exception and tries to
delete it, it won't reference it by fc_nh_id, even if a nexthop
object might be associated to the originating route.
