net/mlx5: Use reversed order when unregister devices

When lag is active, which is controlled by the bonded mlx5e netdev, mlx5
interface unregestering must happen in the reverse order where rdma is
unregistered (unloaded) first, to guarantee all references to the lag
context in hardware is removed, then remove mlx5e netdev interface which
will cleanup the lag context from hardware.

Without this fix during destroy of LAG interface, we observed following
errors:
 * mlx5_cmd_check:752:(pid 12556): DESTROY_LAG(0x843) op_mod(0x0) failed,
   status bad parameter(0x3), syndrome (0xe4ac33)
 * mlx5_cmd_check:752:(pid 12556): DESTROY_LAG(0x843) op_mod(0x0) failed,
   status bad parameter(0x3), syndrome (0xa5aee8).
