samples: bpf: print a warning about headers_install

It seems like periodically someone posts patches to "fix"
header includes.  The issue is that samples expect the
include path to have the uAPI headers (from usr/) first,
and then tools/ headers, so that locally installed uAPI
headers take precedence.  This means that if users didn't
run headers_install they will see all sort of strange
compilation errors, e.g.:

  HOSTCC  samples/bpf/test_lru_dist
  samples/bpf/test_lru_dist.c:39:8: error: redefinition of ‘struct list_head’
   struct list_head {
          ^~~~~~~~~
   In file included from samples/bpf/test_lru_dist.c:9:0:
   ../tools/include/linux/types.h:69:8: note: originally defined here
    struct list_head {
           ^~~~~~~~~

Try to detect this situation, and print a helpful warning.

v2: just use HOSTCC (Jiong).
