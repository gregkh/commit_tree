net: dsa: sja1105: Add logic for TX timestamping

On TX, timestamping is performed synchronously from the
port_deferred_xmit worker thread.
In management routes, the switch is requested to take egress timestamps
(again partial), which are reconstructed and appended to a clone of the
skb that was just sent.  The cloning is done by DSA and we retrieve the
pointer from the structure that DSA keeps in skb->cb.
Then these clones are enqueued to the socket's error queue for
application-level processing.
