mm: section numbers use the type "unsigned long"

Patch series "mm: Further memory block device cleanups", v1.

Some further cleanups around memory block devices.  Especially, clean up
and simplify walk_memory_range().  Including some other minor cleanups.

This patch (of 6):

We are using a mixture of "int" and "unsigned long".  Let's make this
consistent by using "unsigned long" everywhere.  We'll do the same with
memory block ids next.

While at it, turn the "unsigned long i" in removable_show() into an int
- sections_per_block is an int.
