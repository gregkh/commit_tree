drm/fb-helper: Avoid race with DRM userspace

drm_fb_helper_is_bound() is used to check if DRM userspace is in control.
This is done by looking at the fb on the primary plane. By the time
fb-helper gets around to committing, it's possible that the facts have
changed.

Avoid this race by holding the drm_device->master_mutex lock while
committing. When DRM userspace does its first open, it will now wait
until fb-helper is done. The helper will stay away if there's a master.

Two igt tests fail with the new 'bail out if master' rule. Work around
this by relaxing this rule for drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked()
until the tests have been fixed. Add todo entry for this.

Locking rule: Always take the fb-helper lock first.

v5: drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked(): Use
    restore_fbdev_mode_force()

v2:
- Remove drm_fb_helper_is_bound() (Daniel Vetter)
- No need to check fb_helper->dev->master in
  drm_fb_helper_single_fb_probe(), restore_fbdev_mode() has the check.
