drm/msm/dsi_pll_10nm: Release clk hw on destroy and failure

The 10nm pll driver didn't have any failure-path cleanup in register,
and the destroy function didn't unregister any of the hardware. This
patch adds both.

The reason things haven't been blowing up horribly is that msm_drv has a
reference count issue that keeps devices alive, so the destroy function
was never called. That will be fixed in a follow-up patch.
