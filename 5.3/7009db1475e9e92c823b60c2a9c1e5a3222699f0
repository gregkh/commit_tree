drm/i915: Keep engine alive as we retire the context

Though we pin the context first before taking the pm wakeref, during
retire we need to unpin before dropping the pm wakeref (breaking the
"natural" onion). During the unpin, we may need to attach a cleanup
operation on to the engine wakeref, ergo we want to keep the engine
awake until after the unpin.

v2: Push the engine wakeref into the barrier so we keep the onion unwind
ordering in the request itself
