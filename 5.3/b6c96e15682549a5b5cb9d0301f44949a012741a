media: cec: allow any initiator for Ping and Image/Text View On

Some displays pull down the HPD when in standby, but CEC is still
active and the display can be woken up by sending an Image View On
or Text View On CEC command. The CEC specification doesn't tell you
what the initiator should be for such a command (without a HPD it's
unclear if the CEC adapter can claim a logical address).

This patch allows any initiator value when there is no HPD for the
Image/Text View On commands and for the Ping command.
