net/mlx5e: Move to HW checksumming advertising

This patch changes the way the driver advertises its checksum offload
capabilities within the net device features bit mask.

Instead of advertising protocol specific checksumming capabilities
which are limited today to IPv4 and IPv6, we move to reporing
generic HW checksumming capabilities.

This will allow the network stack to let mlx5 device offload checksum
for cases where the IP header is encapsulated within another protocol
and the skb->protocol doesn't indicate one of the IP versions protocol,
specifically in the case of MPLS label encapsulating the IP header and
the skb->protocol indiciates MPLS ethertype rather than IP.

Moving the HW_CSUM reporting is required in the basic net device hw
features mask and also in the extensions (vlan and encpasulation
features) since the extensions are always multiplied by the basic
features set during the packet's traversal through the stack's tx flow.
