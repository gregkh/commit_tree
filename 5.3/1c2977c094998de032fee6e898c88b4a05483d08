net/ibmvnic: free reset work of removed device from queue

Commit 36f1031c51a2 ("ibmvnic: Do not process reset during or after
 device removal") made the change to exit reset if the driver has been
removed, but does not free reset work items of the adapter from queue.

Ensure all reset work items are freed when breaking out of the loop early.
