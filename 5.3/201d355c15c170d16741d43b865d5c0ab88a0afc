arm64/mm: Move PTE_VALID from SW defined to HW page table entry definitions

PTE_VALID signifies that the last level page table entry is valid and it is
MMU recognized while walking the page table. This is not a software defined
PTE bit and should not be listed like one. Just move it to appropriate
header file.
