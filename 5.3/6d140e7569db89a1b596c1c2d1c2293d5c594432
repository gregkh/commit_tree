powerpc/pseries: Update SCM hcall op-codes in hvcall.h

Update the hvcalls.h to include op-codes for new hcalls introduce to
manage SCM memory. Also update existing hcall definitions to reflect
current papr specification for SCM.

The removed hcall op-codes H_SCM_MEM_QUERY, H_SCM_BLOCK_CLEAR were
transient proposals and there support was never implemented by
Power-VM nor they were used anywhere in Linux kernel. Hence we don't
expect anyone to be impacted by this change.
