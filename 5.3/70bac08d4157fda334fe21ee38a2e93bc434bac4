ARM: module: recognize unwind exit sections

In addition to the prefix ".exit", ".ARM.extab.exit" and ".ARM.exidx.exit"
must be recognized as exit sections as well. Otherwise, loading modules can
fail without CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD depending on the memory layout, when
relocations for the unwind sections refer to the .exit.text section:

  imx_sdma: section 16 reloc 0 sym '': relocation 42 out of range
  (0x7f015260 -> 0xc0f5a5e8)

where 0x7F000000 is the module load area and 0xC0000000 is the vmalloc
area. Relocation 42 refers to R_ARM_PREL31, which is limited to signed
31bit offsets.
