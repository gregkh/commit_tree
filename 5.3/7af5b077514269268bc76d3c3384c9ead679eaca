net: mvpp2: cls: Check RSS table index validity when creating a context

Make sure we don't use an out-of-bound index for the per-port RSS
context array.

As of today, the global context creation in mvpp22_rss_context_create
will prevent us from reaching this case, but we should still make sure
we are using a sane value anyway.
