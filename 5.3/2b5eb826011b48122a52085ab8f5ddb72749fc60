xfs: refactor xfs_iwalk_grab_ichunk

In preparation for reusing the iwalk code for the inogrp walking code
(aka INUMBERS), move the initial inobt lookup and retrieval code out of
xfs_iwalk_grab_ichunk so that we call the masking code only when we need
to trim out the inodes that came before the cursor in the inobt record
(aka BULKSTAT).
