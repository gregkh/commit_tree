iommu/arm-smmu: Mark expected switch fall-through

Now that -Wimplicit-fallthrough is passed to GCC by default, the
following warning shows up:

../drivers/iommu/arm-smmu-v3.c: In function ‘arm_smmu_write_strtab_ent’:
../drivers/iommu/arm-smmu-v3.c:1189:7: warning: this statement may fall
 through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
    if (disable_bypass)
       ^
../drivers/iommu/arm-smmu-v3.c:1191:3: note: here
   default:
   ^~~~~~~

Rework so that the compiler doesn't warn about fall-through. Make it
clearer by calling 'BUG_ON()' when disable_bypass is set, and always
'break;'
