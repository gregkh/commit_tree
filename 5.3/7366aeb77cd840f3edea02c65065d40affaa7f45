drm/i915/gvt: fix incorrect cache entry for guest page mapping

GPU hang observed during the guest OCL conformance test which is caused
by THP GTT feature used durning the test.

It was observed the same GFN with different size (4K and 2M) requested
from the guest in GVT. So during the guest page dma map stage, it is
required to unmap first with orginal size and then remap again with
requested size.
