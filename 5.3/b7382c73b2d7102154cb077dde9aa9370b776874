tty: max310x: Don't pass stacked buffers to SPI

SPI transfer tx/rx buffers must be DMA-safe and the structure
documentation clearly states this. Data declared on the system stack isn't
DMA-safe [1]. Instead at least kernel memory should be used for the
buffers. In order to fix this here we can create the buffers at the device
probing stage and use them without any synchronization, since batch
read/write methods are called from non-reentrant contexts - either from
rx-event IRQ threaded handler or from the tx workqueue item.
