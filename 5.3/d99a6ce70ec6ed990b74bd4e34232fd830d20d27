x86/kvm: Fix fastop function ELF metadata

Some of the fastop functions, e.g. em_setcc(), are actually just used as
global labels which point to blocks of functions.  The global labels are
incorrectly annotated as functions.  Also the functions themselves don't
have size annotations.

Fixes a bunch of warnings like the following:

  arch/x86/kvm/emulate.o: warning: objtool: seto() is missing an ELF size annotation
  arch/x86/kvm/emulate.o: warning: objtool: em_setcc() is missing an ELF size annotation
  arch/x86/kvm/emulate.o: warning: objtool: setno() is missing an ELF size annotation
  arch/x86/kvm/emulate.o: warning: objtool: setc() is missing an ELF size annotation
