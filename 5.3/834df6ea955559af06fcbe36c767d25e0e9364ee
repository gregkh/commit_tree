net: mvpp2: cls: Only select applicable flows of classification offload

The way we currently handle classification offload and RSS is by having
dedicated lookup sequences in the flow table, each being selected
depending on several fields being present in the packet header.

We need to make sure the classification operation we want to perform can
be done in each flow we want to insert it into. As an example,
classifying on VLAN tag can only be done on flows used for tagged
traffic.

This commit makes sure we don't insert rules in flows we aren't
compatible with.
