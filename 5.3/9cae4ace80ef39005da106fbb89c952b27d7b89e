selftests/bpf: do not ignore clang failures

When compiling an eBPF prog fails, make still returns 0, because
failing clang command's output is piped to llc and therefore its
exit status is ignored.

When clang fails, pipe the string "clang failed" to llc. This will make
llc fail with an informative error message. This solution was chosen
over using pipefail, having separate targets or getting rid of llc
invocation due to its simplicity.

In addition, pull Kbuild.include in order to get .DELETE_ON_ERROR target,
which would cause partial .o files to be removed.
