drm/i915: Execute signal callbacks from no-op i915_request_wait

If we enter i915_request_wait() with an already completed request, but
unsignaled dma-fence, signal the fence before returning. This allows us
to execute any of the signal callbacks at the earliest opportunity.

v2: Also signal after busyspin success
