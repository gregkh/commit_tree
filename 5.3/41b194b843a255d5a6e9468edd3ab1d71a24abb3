lpfc: add sysfs interface to post NVME RSCN

To support scenarios which aren't bound to nvmetcli add port scenarios,
which is currently where the nvmet_fc transport invokes the discovery
event callbacks, a syfs attribute is added to lpfc which can be written
to cause an RSCN to be generated for the nport.
