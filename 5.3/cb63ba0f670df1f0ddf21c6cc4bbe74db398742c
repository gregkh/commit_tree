perf/x86/intel/cstate: Support multi-die/package

Some cstate counters become die-scoped on Xeon Cascade Lake-AP. Perf cstate
driver needs to support die-scope cstate counters.

Use topology_die_cpumask() to replace topology_core_cpumask().  For
previous platforms which doesn't have multi-die, topology_die_cpumask() is
identical as topology_core_cpumask().  There is no functional change for
previous platforms.

Name the die-scope PMU "cstate_die".
