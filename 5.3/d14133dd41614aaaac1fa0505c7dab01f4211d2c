IB/mlx5: Support set qp counter

Support bind a qp with counter. If counter is null then bind the qp to the
default counter. Different QP state has different operation:

- RESET: Set the counter field so that it will take effective during
  RST2INIT change;
- RTS: Issue an RTS2RTS change to update the QP counter;
- Other: Set the counter field and mark the counter_pending flag, when QP
  is moved to RTS state and this flag is set, then issue an RTS2RTS
  modification to update the counter.
