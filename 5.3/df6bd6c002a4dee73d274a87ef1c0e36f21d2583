mtd: spi-nor: stm32: remove the driver as it was replaced by spi-stm32-qspi.c

There's a new driver using the SPI memory interface of the
SPI framework at spi/spi-stm32-qspi.c, which can be used
together with m25p80.c to replace the functionality of
this SPI NOR driver.

The "new" driver uses the same dt properties and not affects
the legacy compatibility.
