drm/i915/uc: Rename uC firmware init/fini functions

he uC firmware init function is called during GuC/HuC init early phases.
 Rename to include "_early" and properly reflect which phase we are at.

The uC firmware fini function is cleaning up the state set/created on
firmware fetch. Replace "_fini" with "_cleanup_fetch".

v2: also rename uC fw fini function
