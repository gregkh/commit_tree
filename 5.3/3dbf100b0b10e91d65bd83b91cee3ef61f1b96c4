KVM: arm64: Abstract the size of the HYP vectors pre-amble

The EL2 vector hardening feature causes KVM to generate vectors for
each type of CPU present in the system. The generated sequences already
do some of the early guest-exit work (i.e. saving registers). To avoid
duplication the generated vectors branch to the original vector just
after the preamble. This size is hard coded.

Adding new instructions to the HYP vector causes strange side effects,
which are difficult to debug as the affected code is patched in at
runtime.

Add KVM_VECTOR_PREAMBLE to tell kvm_patch_vector_branch() how big
the preamble is. The valid_vect macro can then validate this at
build time.
