drm/amd/display: Don't use ROM for output TF if GAMMA_CS_TFM_1D

We canâ€™t use hardcoded SRGB ROM for output TF if we have GAMMA_CS_TFM_1D
(unless we know 1D LUT is identity), so we never want to return here early.
We apply the LUT part of ColorTransform3x4 only in apply_lut_1d() which is
called near the end of that function.
