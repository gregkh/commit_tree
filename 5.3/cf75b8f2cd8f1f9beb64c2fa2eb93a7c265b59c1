pinctrl: tegra: Add bitmask support for parked bits

Some pin groups have park bits for multiple pins in one register.
Support this by turning the parked bit field into a parked bitmask
field. If no parked bits are supported, the bitmask can be 0.

Update the pingroup table on Tegra210, which is the only generation
where this is supported, with the parked bitmask.
