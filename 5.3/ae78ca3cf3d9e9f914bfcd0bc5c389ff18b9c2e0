xen/blkback: fix memory leaks

In read_per_ring_refs(), after 'req' and related memory regions are
allocated, xen_blkif_map() is invoked to map the shared frame, irq, and
etc. However, if this mapping process fails, no cleanup is performed,
leading to memory leaks. To fix this issue, invoke the cleanup before
returning the error.
