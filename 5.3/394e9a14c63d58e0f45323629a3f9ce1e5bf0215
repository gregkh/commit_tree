drm/amdgpu: Need to set the baco cap before baco reset

For passthrough, after rebooted the VM, driver will do
a baco reset before doing other driver initialization during loading
 driver. For doing the baco reset, it will first
check the baco reset capability. So first need to set the
cap from the vbios information or baco reset won't be
enabled.
