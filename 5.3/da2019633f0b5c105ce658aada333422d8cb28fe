perf annotate TUI browser: Do not use member from variable within its own initialization

Some compilers will complain when using a member of a struct to
initialize another member, in the same struct initialization.

For instance:

  debian:8      Debian clang version 3.5.0-10 (tags/RELEASE_350/final) (based on LLVM 3.5.0)
  oraclelinux:7 clang version 3.4.2 (tags/RELEASE_34/dot2-final)

Produce:

  ui/browsers/annotate.c:104:12: error: variable 'ops' is uninitialized when used within its own initialization [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
                                              (!ops.current_entry ||
                                                ^~~
  1 error generated.

So use an extra variable, initialized just before that struct, to have
the value used in the expressions used to init two of the struct
members.
