scsi: ufs-qcom: Add support for platforms booting ACPI

New Qualcomm AArch64 based laptops are now available which use UFS as their
primary data storage medium.  These devices are supplied with ACPI support
out of the box.  This patch ensures the Qualcomm UFS driver will be bound
when the "QCOM24A5" H/W device is advertised as present.
