spi: bcm2835: make the polling duration limits configurable

Under some circumstances the default 30 us polling limit is not optimal
and may lead to long delays because we are waiting on an interrupt.
with this patch we have the possibility to influence this policy.

So make this limit (in us) configurable via a module parameters
(but also modifyable via /sys/modules/...)

This replicates similar code found in spi-bcm2835aux.
