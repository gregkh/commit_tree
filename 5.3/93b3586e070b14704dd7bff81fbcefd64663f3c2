net/mlx5: Support inner header match criteria for non decap flow action

We have an issue that OVS application creates an offloaded drop rule
that drops VXLAN traffic with both inner and outer header match
criteria. mlx5_core driver detects correctly the inner and outer
header match criteria but does not enable the inner header match criteria
due to an incorrect assumption in mlx5_eswitch_add_offloaded_rule that
only decap rule needs inner header criteria.

Solution:
Remove mlx5_esw_flow_attr's match_level and tunnel_match_level and add
two new members: inner_match_level and outer_match_level.
inner/outer_match_level is set to NONE if the inner/outer match criteria
is not specified in the tc rule creation request. The decap assumption is
removed and the code just needs to check for inner/outer_match_level to
enable the corresponding bit in firmware's match_criteria_enable value.
