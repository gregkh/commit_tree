keys: Include target namespace in match criteria

Currently a key has a standard matching criteria of { type, description }
and this is used to only allow keys with unique criteria in a keyring.
This means, however, that you cannot have keys with the same type and
description but a different target namespace in the same keyring.

This is a potential problem for a containerised environment where, say, a
container is made up of some parts of its mount space involving netfs
superblocks from two different network namespaces.

This is also a problem for shared system management keyrings such as the
DNS records keyring or the NFS idmapper keyring that might contain keys
from different network namespaces.

Fix this by including a namespace component in a key's matching criteria.
Keyring types are marked to indicate which, if any, namespace is relevant
to keys of that type, and that namespace is set when the key is created
from the current task's namespace set.

The capability bit KEYCTL_CAPS1_NS_KEY_TAG is set if the kernel is
employing this feature.
