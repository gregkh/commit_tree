usb: dwc3: qcom: Improve error handling

dwc3_qcom_clk_init() is called with of_count_phandle_with_args() as an
argument.  If of_count_phandle_with_args() returns an error, the number
of clocks will be a negative value and will lead to undefined behaviour.

Ensure we check for an error before attempting to blindly use the value.
