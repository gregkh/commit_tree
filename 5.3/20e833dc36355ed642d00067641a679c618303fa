crypto: ccp - memset structure fields to zero before reuse

The AES GCM function reuses an 'op' data structure, which members
contain values that must be cleared for each (re)use.

This fix resolves a crypto self-test failure:
alg: aead: gcm-aes-ccp encryption test failed (wrong result) on test vector 2, cfg="two even aligned splits"
