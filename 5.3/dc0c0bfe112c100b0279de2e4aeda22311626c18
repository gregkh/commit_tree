drm/i915: Add readout and state check for pch_pfit.force_thru

Convert the HSW pch_pfit.force_thru to a proper state variable
with readout and accompanying pipe conf check. Makes the logic
a bit more straightforward, and hopefully prevents some
breakage in the future.

'force_thru' is probably not the best name for this, but I
didn't manage to come up with anything better either, so I
left it alone.
