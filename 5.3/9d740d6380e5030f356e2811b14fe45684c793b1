ath10k: Add wrapper function to ath10k debug

ath10k_dbg() is called in ath10k_process_rx() with huge set of arguments
which is causing CPU overhead even when debug_mask is not set.
Good improvement was observed in the receive side performance when call
to ath10k_dbg() is avoided in the RX path.

Since currently all debug messages are sent via tracing infrastructure,
we cannot entirely avoid calling ath10k_dbg. Therefore, call to
ath10k_dbg() is made conditional based on tracing config in the driver.

Trasmit performance remains unchanged with this patch; below are some
experimental results with this patch and tracing disabled.
