flow_dissector: Fix potential use-after-free on BPF_PROG_DETACH

Call to bpf_prog_put(), with help of call_rcu(), queues an RCU-callback to
free the program once a grace period has elapsed. The callback can run
together with new RCU readers that started after the last grace period.
New RCU readers can potentially see the "old" to-be-freed or already-freed
pointer to the program object before the RCU update-side NULLs it.

Reorder the operations so that the RCU update-side resets the protected
pointer before the end of the grace period after which the program will be
freed.
