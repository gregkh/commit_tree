btrfs: Streamline replace sem unlock in btrfs_dev_replace_start

There are only 2 branches which goto leave label with need_unlock set
to true. Essentially need_unlock is used as a substitute for directly
calling up_write. Since the branches needing this are only 2 and their
context is not that big it's more clear to just call up_write where
required. No functional changes.
