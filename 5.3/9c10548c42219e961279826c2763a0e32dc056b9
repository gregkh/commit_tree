tools lib: Move argv_{split,free} from tools/perf/util/

This came from the kernel lib/argv_split.c, so move it to
tools/lib/argv_split.c, to get it closer to the kernel structure.

We need to audit the usage of argv_split() to figure out if it is really
necessary to do have one allocation per argv[] entry, looking at one of
its users I guess that is not the case and we probably are even leaking
those allocations by not using argv_free() judiciously, for later.

With this we further remove stuff from tools/perf/util/, reducing the
perf specific codebase and encouraging other tools/ code to use these
routines so as to keep the style and constructs used with the kernel.
