x86/speculation/swapgs: Exclude ATOMs from speculation through SWAPGS

Intel provided the following information:

 On all current Atom processors, instructions that use a segment register
 value (e.g. a load or store) will not speculatively execute before the
 last writer of that segment retires. Thus they will not use a
 speculatively written segment value.

That means on ATOMs there is no speculation through SWAPGS, so the SWAPGS
entry paths can be excluded from the extra LFENCE if PTI is disabled.

Create a separate bug flag for the through SWAPGS speculation and mark all
out-of-order ATOMs and AMD/HYGON CPUs as not affected. The in-order ATOMs
are excluded from the whole mitigation mess anyway.
