kvm: vmx: segment limit check: use access length

There is an imperfection in get_vmx_mem_address(): access length is ignored
when checking the limit. To fix this, pass access length as a function argument.
The access length is usually obvious since it is used by callers after
get_vmx_mem_address() call, but for vmread/vmwrite it depends on the
state of 64-bit mode.
