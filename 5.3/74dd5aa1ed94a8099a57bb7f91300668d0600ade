cxgb4: Enable hash filter with offload

Hash (exact-match) filters used for offloading flows share the
same active region resources on the chip with upper layer drivers,
like iw_cxgb4, chcr, etc. Currently, only either Hash filters
or ULDs can use the active region resources, but not both. Hence,
use the new firmware configuration parameters (when available)
to allow both the Hash filters and ULDs to share the
active region simultaneously.
