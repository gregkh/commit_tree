pwm: meson: Fix the G12A AO clock parents order

The Amlogic G12A and G12B Documentation is wrong, the AO xtal and clk81
clock source order is reversed, and validated when adding DVFS support
by using the PWM AO D output to control the CPU supply voltage.

The vendor tree also uses the reversed xtal and clk81 order at [1].
