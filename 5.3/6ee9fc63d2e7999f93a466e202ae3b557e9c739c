tools/power turbostat: do not enforce 1ms

Turbostat works by taking a snapshot of counters, sleeping, taking another
snapshot, calculating deltas, and printing out the table.

The sleep time is controlled via -i option or by user sending a signal or a
character to stdin. In the latter case, turbostat always adds 1 ms
sleep before it reads the counters, in order to avoid larger imprecisions
in the results in prints.

While the 1 ms delay may be a good idea for a "dumb" user, it is a
problem for an "aware" user. I do thousands and thousands of measurements
over a short period of time (like 2ms), and turbostat unconditionally adds
a 1ms to my interval, so I cannot get what I really need.

This patch removes the unconditional 1ms sleep. This is an expert user
tool, after all, and non-experts will unlikely ever use it in the non-fixed
interval mode anyway, so I think it is OK to remove the 1ms delay.
