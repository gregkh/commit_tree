don't bother with registering rootfs

init_mount_tree() can get to rootfs_fs_type directly and that simplifies
a lot of things.  We don't need to register it, we don't need to look
it up *and* we don't need to bother with preventing subsequent userland
mounts.  That's the way we should've done that from the very beginning.

There is a user-visible change, namely the disappearance of "rootfs"
from /proc/filesystems.  Note that it's been unmountable all along
and it didn't show up in /proc/mounts; however, it *is* a user-visible
change and theoretically some script might've been using its presence
in /proc/filesystems to tell 2.4.11+ from earlier kernels.

*IF* any complaints about behaviour change do show up, we could fake
it in /proc/filesystems.  I very much doubt we'll have to, though.
