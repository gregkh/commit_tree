s390/cio: Squash cp_free() and cp_unpin_free()

The routine cp_free() does nothing but call cp_unpin_free(), and while
most places call cp_free() there is one caller of cp_unpin_free() used
when the cp is guaranteed to have not been marked initialized.

This seems like a dubious way to make a distinction, so let's combine
these routines and make cp_free() do all the work.
