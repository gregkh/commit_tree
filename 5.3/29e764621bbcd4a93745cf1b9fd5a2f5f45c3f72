drm/amdkfd: Add gws number to kfd topology node properties

Add amdgpu_amdkfd interface to get num_gws and add num_gws
to /sys/class/kfd/kfd/topology/nodes/x/properties. Only report
num_gws if MEC FW support GWS barriers. Currently it is
determined by a module parameter which will be replaced
with MEC FW version check when firmware is ready.
