mm/memcontrol.c: keep local VM counters in sync with the hierarchical ones

After commit 815744d75152 ("mm: memcontrol: don't batch updates of local
VM stats and events"), the local VM counter are not in sync with the
hierarchical ones.

Below is one example in a leaf memcg on my server (with 8 CPUs):

	inactive_file 3567570944
	total_inactive_file 3568029696

We find that the deviation is very great because the 'val' in
__mod_memcg_state() is in pages while the effective value in
memcg_stat_show() is in bytes.

So the maximum of this deviation between local VM stats and total VM
stats can be (32 * number_of_cpu * PAGE_SIZE), that may be an
unacceptably great value.

We should keep the local VM stats in sync with the total stats.  In
order to keep this behavior the same across counters, this patch updates
__mod_lruvec_state() and __count_memcg_events() as well.
