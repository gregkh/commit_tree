Revert "serial: 8250: Don't service RX FIFO if interrupts are disabled"

This reverts commit 2e9fe539108320820016f78ca7704a7342788380.

Reading LSR unconditionally but processing the error flags only if
UART_IIR_RDI bit was set before in IIR may lead to a loss of transmission
error information on UARTs where the transmission error flags are cleared
by a read of LSR. Information are lost in case an error is detected right
before the read of LSR while processing e.g. an UART_IIR_THRI interrupt.
