ALSA: hda/realtek - Headphone Mic can't record after S3

Dell headset mode platform with ALC236.
It doesn't recording after system resume from S3.
S3 mode was deep. s2idle was not has this issue.
S3 deep will cut of codec power. So, the register will back to default
after resume back.
This patch will solve this issue.
