drm/amd/display: update calculated bounding box logic for NV

[why]
Current calculation of bounding box will cause DML to increase voltage
state due to DPP or DISPCLK, this is unnecessary since from DML perspective
we can max DPP/DISP can be supported at DPM0.  This is because
increasing voltage for DPP/DISP is done separately via actual minimum values
of DISP and DPP CLK

[how]
For each calculated state, DPP, DISP, PHY, and DSC clk should always be set to
maximum.  FCLK, SOCCLK, and DCFCLK should be based of UCLK.
