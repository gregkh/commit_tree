i2c: at91: disable TXRDY interrupt after sending data

Driver was not disabling TXRDY interrupt after last TX byte.
This caused interrupt storm until transfer timeouts for slow
or broken device on the bus. The patch fixes the interrupt storm
on my SAMA5D2-based board.

Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 5.2.x
[v5.2 introduced file split; the patch should apply to i2c-at91.c before the split]
Fixes: fac368a04048 ("i2c: at91: add new driver")
