drm/i915/gtt: set err to -ENOMEM on memory allocation failure

Currently when the allocation of ppgtt->work fails the error return
path via err_free returns an uninitialized value in err. Fix this
by setting err to the appropriate error return of -ENOMEM.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
