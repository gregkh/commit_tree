perf/x86/amd/ibs: Fix sample bias for dispatched micro-ops

When counting dispatched micro-ops with cnt_ctl=1, in order to prevent
sample bias, IBS hardware preloads the least significant 7 bits of
current count (IbsOpCurCnt) with random values, such that, after the
interrupt is handled and counting resumes, the next sample taken
will be slightly perturbed.

The current count bitfield is in the IBS execution control h/w register,
alongside the maximum count field.

Currently, the IBS driver writes that register with the maximum count,
leaving zeroes to fill the current count field, thereby overwriting
the random bits the hardware preloaded for itself.

Fix the driver to actually retain and carry those random bits from the
read of the IBS control register, through to its write, instead of
overwriting the lower current count bits with zeroes.

Tested with:

perf record -c 100001 -e ibs_op/cnt_ctl=1/pp -a -C 0 taskset -c 0 <workload>

Tested on Family 15h and 17h machines.

Machines prior to family 10h Rev. C don't have the RDWROPCNT capability,
and have the IbsOpCurCnt bitfield reserved, so this patch shouldn't
affect their operation.

It is unknown why commit db98c5faf8cb ("perf/x86: Implement 64-bit
counter support for IBS") ignored the lower 4 bits of the IbsOpCurCnt
field; the number of preloaded random bits has always been 7, AFAICT.
