mm/balloon_compaction: suppress allocation warnings

There is no reason to print warnings when balloon page allocation fails,
as they are expected and can be handled gracefully.  Since VMware
balloon now uses balloon-compaction infrastructure, and suppressed these
warnings before, it is also beneficial to suppress these warnings to
keep the same behavior that the balloon had before.
