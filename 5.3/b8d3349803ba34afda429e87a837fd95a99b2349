sched/rt, Kconfig: Unbreak def/oldconfig with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y

The merge of the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT stub renamed CONFIG_PREEMPT to
CONFIG_PREEMPT_LL which causes all defconfigs which have CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
set to fall back to CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE because CONFIG_PREEMPT depends on
the preemption mode choice wich defaults to NONE. This also affects
oldconfig builds.

So rather than changing 114 defconfig files and being an annoyance to
users, revert the rename and select a new config symbol PREEMPTION. That
keeps everything working smoothly and the revelant ifdef's are going to be
fixed up step by step.
