perf diff: Check if all data files with branch stacks

We will expand perf diff to support diff cycles of individual programs
blocks, so it requires all data files having branch stacks.

This patch checks HEADER_BRANCH_STACK in header, and only set the flag
has_br_stack when HEADER_BRANCH_STACK are set in all data files.

 v2:
 ---
 Move check_file_brstack() from __cmd_diff() to cmd_diff().
 Because later patch will check flag 'has_br_stack' before
 ui_init().
