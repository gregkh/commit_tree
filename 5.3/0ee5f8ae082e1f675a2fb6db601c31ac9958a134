btrfs: fix minimum number of chunk errors for DUP

The list of profiles in btrfs_chunk_max_errors lists DUP as a profile
DUP able to tolerate 1 device missing. Though this profile is special
with 2 copies, it still needs the device, unlike the others.

Looking at the history of changes, thre's no clear reason why DUP is
there, functions were refactored and blocks of code merged to one
helper.
