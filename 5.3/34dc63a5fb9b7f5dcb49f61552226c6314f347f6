m68k: Use the generic dma coherent remap allocator

This switches m68k to using common code for the DMA allocations,
including potential use of the CMA allocator if configured.
Also add a comment where the existing behavior seems to be lacking.

Switching to the generic code enables DMA allocations from atomic
context, which is required by the DMA API documentation, and also
adds various other minor features drivers start relying upon.  It
also makes sure we have a tested code base for all architectures
that require uncached pte bits for coherent DMA allocations.
