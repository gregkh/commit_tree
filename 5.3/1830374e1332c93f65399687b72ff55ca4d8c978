drm/i915: Cancel retire_worker on parking

Replace the racy continuation check within retire_work with a definite
kill-switch on idling. The race was being exposed by gem_concurrent_blit
where the retire_worker would be terminated too early leaving us
spinning in debugfs/i915_drop_caches with nothing flushing the
retirement queue.

Although that the igt is trying to idle from one child while submitting
from another may be a contributing factor as to why  it runs so slowly...

v2: Use the non-sync version of cancel_delayed_work(), we only need to
stop it from being scheduled as we independently check whether now is
the right time to be parking.

Testcase: igt/gem_concurrent_blit
