i2c: i801: Avoid memory leak in check_acpi_smo88xx_device()

check_acpi_smo88xx_device() utilizes acpi_get_object_info() which in its turn
allocates a buffer. User is responsible to clean allocated resources. The last
has been missed in the original code. Fix it here.

While here, replace !ACPI_SUCCESS() with ACPI_FAILURE().
