ASoC: Intel: boards: kbl_da7219_max98927: add dai_trigger function

amplifier feedback is not modeled as being dependent on any active
output. Even when there is no playback happening, parts of the graph,
specifically the IV sense->speaker protection->output remains active
and this prevents the DSP from entering low-power states.

This patch suggest a machine driver level approach where the speaker
pins are enabled/disabled dynamically depending on stream start/stop
events. DPAM graph representations show the feedback loop is indeed
disabled and low-power states can be reached.
