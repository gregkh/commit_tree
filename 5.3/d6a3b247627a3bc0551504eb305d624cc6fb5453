docs: scheduler: convert docs to ReST and rename to *.rst

In order to prepare to add them to the Kernel API book,
convert the files to ReST format.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
