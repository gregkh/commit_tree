platform/x86: asus-wmi: Enhance detection of thermal data

The obviously wrong value 1 for temperature device ID in this driver is
returned by at least some devices, including TUF Gaming series laptops,
instead of 0 as expected previously. Observable effect is that a
temp1_input in hwmon reads temperature near absolute zero.

Consider 0.1 K an erroneous value in addition to 0 K.
