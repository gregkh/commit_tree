blk-mq: remove blk_mq_put_ctx()

No code that occurs between blk_mq_get_ctx() and blk_mq_put_ctx() depends
on preemption being disabled for its correctness. Since removing the CPU
preemption calls does not measurably affect performance, simplify the
blk-mq code by removing the blk_mq_put_ctx() function and also by not
disabling preemption in blk_mq_get_ctx().
