iommu: Add recoverable fault reporting

Some IOMMU hardware features, for example PCI PRI and Arm SMMU Stall,
enable recoverable I/O page faults. Allow IOMMU drivers to report PRI Page
Requests and Stall events through the new fault reporting API. The
consumer of the fault can be either an I/O page fault handler in the host,
or a guest OS.

Once handled, the fault must be completed by sending a page response back
to the IOMMU. Add an iommu_page_response() function to complete a page
fault.

There are two ways to extend the userspace API:
* Add a field to iommu_page_response and a flag to
  iommu_page_response::flags describing the validity of this field.
* Introduce a new iommu_page_response_X structure with a different version
  number. The kernel must then support both versions.
