tools: bpftool: add -d option to get debug output from libbpf

libbpf has three levels of priority for output messages: warn, info,
debug. By default, debug output is not printed to the console.

Add a new "--debug" (short name: "-d") option to bpftool to print libbpf
logs for all three levels.

Internally, we simply use the function provided by libbpf to replace the
default printing function by one that prints logs regardless of their
level.

v2:
- Remove the possibility to select the log-levels to use (v1 offered a
  combination of "warn", "info" and "debug").
- Rename option and offer a short name: -d|--debug.
- Add option description to all bpftool manual pages (instead of
  bpftool-prog.rst only), as all commands use libbpf.
