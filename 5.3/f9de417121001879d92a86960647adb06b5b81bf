tools/memory-model: Expand definition of barrier

Commit 66be4e66a7f4 ("rcu: locking and unlocking need to always be at
least barriers") added compiler barriers back into rcu_read_lock() and
rcu_read_unlock().  Furthermore, srcu_read_lock() and
srcu_read_unlock() have always contained compiler barriers.

The Linux Kernel Memory Model ought to know about these barriers.
This patch adds them into the memory model.
