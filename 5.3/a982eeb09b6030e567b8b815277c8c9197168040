io_uring: fix an issue when IOSQE_IO_LINK is inserted into defer list

This patch may fix two issues:

First, when IOSQE_IO_DRAIN set, the next IOs need to be inserted into
defer list to delay execution, but link io will be actively scheduled to
run by calling io_queue_sqe.

Second, when multiple LINK_IOs are inserted together with defer_list,
the LINK_IO is no longer keep order.

   |   LINK_IO   |      ----> insert to defer_list  -----------
   |-------------|                                            |
   |   LINK_IO   |      ----> insert to defer_list  ----------|
   |-------------|                                            |
   |   LINK_IO   |      ----> insert to defer_list  ----------|
   |-------------|                                            |
   |   NORMAL_IO |      ----> insert to defer_list  ----------|
   |-------------|                                            |
                                                              |
                              queue_work at same time   <-----|
