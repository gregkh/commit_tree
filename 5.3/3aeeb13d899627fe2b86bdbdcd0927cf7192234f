drm/modes: Support modes names on the command line

The drm subsystem also uses the video= kernel parameter, and in the
documentation refers to the fbdev documentation for that parameter.

However, that documentation also says that instead of giving the mode using
its resolution we can also give a name. However, DRM doesn't handle that
case at the moment. Even though in most case it shouldn't make any
difference, it might be useful for analog modes, where different standards
might have the same resolution, but still have a few different parameters
that are not encoded in the modes (NTSC vs NTSC-J vs PAL-M for example).
