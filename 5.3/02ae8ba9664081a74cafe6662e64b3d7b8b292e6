drm/i915/icl: Add Multi-segmented gamma support

ICL introduces a new gamma correction mode in display engine, called
multi-segmented-gamma mode. This mode allows users to program the
darker region of the gamma curve with sueprfine precision. An
example use case for this is HDR curves (like PQ ST-2084).

If we plot a gamma correction curve from value range between 0.0 to 1.0,
ICL's multi-segment has 3 different sections:
- superfine segment: 9 values, ranges between 0 - 1/(128 * 256)
- fine segment: 257 values, ranges between 0 - 1/(128)
- corase segment: 257 values, ranges between 0 - 1

This patch:
- Changes gamma LUTs size for ICL/GEN11 to 262144 entries (8 * 128 * 256),
  so that userspace can program with highest precision supported.
- Changes default gamma mode (non-legacy) to multi-segmented-gamma mode.
- Adds functions to program/detect multi-segment gamma.

V2: Addressed review comments from Ville
    - separate function for superfine and fine segments.
    - remove enum for segments.
    - reuse last entry of the LUT as gc_max value.
    - replace if() ....cond with switch...case in icl_load_luts.
    - add an entry variable, instead of 'word'

V3: Addressed review comments from Ville
    - extra newline
    - s/entry/color/
    - remove LUT size checks
    - program ilk_lut_12p4_ldw value before ilk_lut_12p4_udw
    - Change the comments in description of fine and coarse segments,
      and try to make more sense.
    - use 8 * 128 instead of 1024
    - add 1 entry in LUT for GCMAX

V4: Addressed review comments from Ville
    - Remove unused macro
    - missing shift entry in blue
    - pick correct entry for GCMAX
    - Added Ville's R-B
Note: Tested and confirmed the programming sequence of odd/even
registers in the HW. The correct sequence should be:
	ilk_lut_12p4_udw
	ilk_lut_12p4_ldw

v5: Addressed Ville's review comments and renamed odd/even register
helpers to be more consistent with the values.
