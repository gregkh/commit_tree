dmaengine: axi-dmac: terminate early DMA transfers after a partial one

When a partial transfer is received, the driver should not submit any more
segments to the hardware, as they will be ignored/unused until a new
transfer start operation is done.

This change implements this by adding a new flag on the AXI DMAC
descriptor. This flags is set to true, if there was a partial transfer in
a previously completed segment. When that flag is true, the TLAST flag is
added to the to the submitted segment, signaling the controller to stop
receiving more segments.
