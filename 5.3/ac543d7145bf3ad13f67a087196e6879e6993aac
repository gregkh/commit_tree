drm/i915: Report an earlier wedged event when suspending the engines

On i915_gem_load_power_context() we do care whether or not we succeed in
completing the switch back to the kernel context (via idling the
engines). Currently, we detect if an error occurs while we wait, but we
do not report one if it occurred beforehand (and the status of the
switch is undefined). Check the current terminally wedged status on
entering the wait, and report it after flushing the requests, as if it
had occurred during our own wait.
