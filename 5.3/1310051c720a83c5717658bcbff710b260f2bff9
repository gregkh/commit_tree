xprtrdma: Replace use of xdr_stream_pos in rpcrdma_marshal_req

This is a latent bug. xdr_stream_pos works by subtracting
xdr_stream::nwords from xdr_buf::len. But xdr_stream::nwords is not
initialized by xdr_init_encode().

It works today only because all fields in rpcrdma_req::rl_stream
are initialized to zero by rpcrdma_req_create, making the
subtraction in xdr_stream_pos always a no-op.

I found this issue via code inspection. It was introduced by commit
39f4cd9e9982 ("xprtrdma: Harden chunk list encoding against send
buffer overflow"), but the code has changed enough since then that
this fix can't be automatically applied to stable.
