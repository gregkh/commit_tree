processor: get rid of cpu_relax_yield

stop_machine is the only user left of cpu_relax_yield. Given that it
now has special semantics which are tied to stop_machine introduce a
weak stop_machine_yield function which architectures can override, and
get rid of the generic cpu_relax_yield implementation.
