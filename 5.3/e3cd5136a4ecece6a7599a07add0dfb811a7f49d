kconfig: remove meaningless if-conditional in conf_read()

sym_is_choice(sym) has already been checked by previous if-block:

    if (sym_is_choice(sym) || (sym->flags & SYMBOL_NO_WRITE))
            continue;

Hence, the following code is redundant, and the comment is misleading:

    if (!sym_is_choice(sym))
            continue;
    /* fall through */

It always takes 'continue', never falls though.

Clean up the dead code.
