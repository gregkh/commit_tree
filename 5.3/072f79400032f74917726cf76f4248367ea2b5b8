s390/qeth: serialize cmd reply with concurrent timeout

Callbacks for a cmd reply run outside the protection of card->lock, to
allow for additional cmds to be issued & enqueued in parallel.

When qeth_send_control_data() bails out for a cmd without having
received a reply (eg. due to timeout), its callback may concurrently be
processing a reply that just arrived. In this case, the callback
potentially accesses a stale reply->reply_param area that eg. was
on-stack and has already been released.

To avoid this race, add some locking so that qeth_send_control_data()
can (1) wait for a concurrently running callback, and (2) zap any
pending callback that still wants to run.
