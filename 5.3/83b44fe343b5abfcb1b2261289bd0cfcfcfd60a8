drivers: base: cacheinfo: Ensure cpu hotplug work is done before Intel RDT

The cacheinfo structures are alloced/freed by cpu online/offline
callbacks. Originally these were only used by sysfs to expose the
cache topology to user space. Without any in-kernel dependencies
CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN was an appropriate choice.

resctrl has started using these structures to identify CPUs that
share a cache. It updates its 'domain' structures from cpu
online/offline callbacks. These depend on the cacheinfo structures
(resctrl_online_cpu()->domain_add_cpu()->get_cache_id()->
 get_cpu_cacheinfo()).
These also run as CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN.

Now that there is an in-kernel dependency, move the cacheinfo
work earlier so we know its done before resctrl's CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN
work runs.
