ASoC: codec: hdac_hdmi: fix pin connections at cvt enable

In display codecs supported by hdac_hdmi, the connection indices are
shared by all converters. At boot and resume from suspend,
the connection state may be reset to default values.

In case of multiple connected pins (multiple monitors connected
with audio capability), routing and mute status of pins that
are not connected to any PCM, may interfere with other pins.
E.g. after resume from S3 with multiple monitors, unless
all converters are in active use, playback to some PCMs may
be muted due to the default settings of unrelated converters.

Avoid this by ensuring all pin:cvt selections are correct
in codec whenever a converter is enabled for playback.
