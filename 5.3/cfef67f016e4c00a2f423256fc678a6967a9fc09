ALSA: hda - Fix a memory leak bug

In snd_hda_parse_generic_codec(), 'spec' is allocated through kzalloc().
Then, the pin widgets in 'codec' are parsed. However, if the parsing
process fails, 'spec' is not deallocated, leading to a memory leak.

To fix the above issue, free 'spec' before returning the error.
