net: mvpp2: cls: Use a dedicated lu_type for the RSS lookup

When performing a TCAM lookup in the C2 engine, it's possible that
multiple entries match the packet. To make sure the correct entry match
when performing a lookup, the Flow Table can set a lookup type, which
will be used in the TCAM lookup, thus preventing such false-positives.

We need to make sure the RSS match doesn't interfere with other
classification lookups, hence we use a dedicated lookup_type for it.
