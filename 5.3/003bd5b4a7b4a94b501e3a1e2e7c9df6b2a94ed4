r8169: don't use MSI before RTL8168d

It was reported that after resuming from suspend network fails with
error "do_IRQ: 3.38 No irq handler for vector", see [0]. Enabling WoL
can work around the issue, but the only actual fix is to disable MSI.
So let's mimic the behavior of the vendor driver and disable MSI on
all chip versions before RTL8168d.
