dmaengine: bcm-sba-raid: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

Also, because there is no need to save the file dentry, remove the
variable that was saving it as it was never even being used once set.
