mailmap: add aliases for Dmitry Safonov

I don't work for Virtuozzo or Samsung anymore and I've noticed that they
have started sending annoying html email-replies.

And I prioritize my personal emails over work email box, so while at it
add an entry for Arista too - so I can reply faster when needed.
