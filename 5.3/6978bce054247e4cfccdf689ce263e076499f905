drm/komeda: Reordered the komeda's de-init functions

The de-init routine should be doing the following in order:-
1. Unregister the drm device
2. Shut down the crtcs - failing to do this might cause a connector leakage
See the 'commit 109c4d18e574 ("drm/arm/malidp: Ensure that the crtcs are
shutdown before removing any encoder/connector")'
3. Disable the interrupts
4. Unbind the components
5. Free up DRM mode_config info

Changes from v1:-
1. Re-ordered the header files inclusion
2. Rebased on top of the latest drm-misc-fixes
