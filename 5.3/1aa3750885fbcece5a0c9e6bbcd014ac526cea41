drm/i915/icl: More workaround for port F detection due to broken VBTs

Add another ICL-Y PCIID that proved to have only 5 ports to the
corresponding PCIID list.

Meanwhile I'm trying to get a complete list of all PCIIDs with less than
6 ports and/or get a VBT fix to mark these ports non-existent, but until
then the only way is to go one-by-one.

This fixes the following error on machines with less than 6 port:

	[drm:intel_power_well_enable [i915]] enabling AUX F
	------------[ cut here ]------------
	WARN_ON(intel_wait_for_register(&dev_priv->uncore, regs->driver, (0x1 << ((pw_idx) * 2)), (0x1 << ((pw_idx) * 2)), 1))
