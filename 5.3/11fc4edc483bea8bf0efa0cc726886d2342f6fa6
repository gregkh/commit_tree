pwm: bcm2835: Improve precision of PWM

If sending IR with carrier of 455kHz using the pwm-ir-tx driver, the
carrier ends up being 476kHz. The clock is set to bcm2835-pwm with a
rate of 10MHz.

A carrier of 455kHz has a period of 2198ns, but the arithmetic truncates
this to 2100ns rather than 2200ns. So, use DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST() to reduce
rounding errors, and we have a much more accurate carrier of 454.5kHz.
