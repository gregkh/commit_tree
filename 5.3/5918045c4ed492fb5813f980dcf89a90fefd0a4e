drm/scheduler: rework job destruction

We now destroy finished jobs from the worker thread to make sure that
we never destroy a job currently in timeout processing.
By this we avoid holding lock around ring mirror list in drm_sched_stop
which should solve a deadlock reported by a user.

v2: Remove unused variable.
v4: Move guilty job free into sched code.
v5:
Move sched->hw_rq_count to drm_sched_start to account for counter
decrement in drm_sched_stop even when we don't call resubmit jobs
if guily job did signal.
v6: remove unused variable
