drm/i915: Replace engine->timeline with a plain list

To continue the onslaught of removing the assumption of a global
execution ordering, another casualty is the engine->timeline. Without an
actual timeline to track, it is overkill and we can replace it with a
much less grand plain list. We still need a list of requests inflight,
for the simple purpose of finding inflight requests (for retiring,
resetting, preemption etc).
