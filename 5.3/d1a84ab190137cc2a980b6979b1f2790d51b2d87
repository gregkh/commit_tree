tools/memory-model: Add definitions of plain and marked accesses

This patch adds definitions for marked and plain accesses to the
Linux-Kernel Memory Model.  It also modifies the definitions of the
existing parts of the model (including the cumul-fence, prop, hb, pb,
and rb relations) so as to make them apply only to marked accesses.
