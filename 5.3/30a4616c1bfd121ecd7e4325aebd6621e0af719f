tipc: use rcu dereference functions properly

For these places are protected by rcu_read_lock, we change from
rcu_dereference_rtnl to rcu_dereference, as there is no need to
check if rtnl lock is held.

For these places are protected by rtnl_lock, we change from
rcu_dereference_rtnl to rtnl_dereference/rcu_dereference_protected,
as no extra memory barriers are needed under rtnl_lock() which also
protects tn->bearer_list[] and dev->tipc_ptr/b->media_ptr updating.

rcu_dereference_rtnl will be only used in the places where it could
be under rcu_read_lock or rtnl_lock.
