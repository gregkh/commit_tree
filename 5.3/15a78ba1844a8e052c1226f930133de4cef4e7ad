netfilter: ebtables: fix a memory leak bug in compat

In compat_do_replace(), a temporary buffer is allocated through vmalloc()
to hold entries copied from the user space. The buffer address is firstly
saved to 'newinfo->entries', and later on assigned to 'entries_tmp'. Then
the entries in this temporary buffer is copied to the internal kernel
structure through compat_copy_entries(). If this copy process fails,
compat_do_replace() should be terminated. However, the allocated temporary
buffer is not freed on this path, leading to a memory leak.

To fix the bug, free the buffer before returning from compat_do_replace().
