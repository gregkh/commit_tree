net/mlx5e: Fix false negative indication on tx reporter CQE recovery

Remove wrong error return value when SQ is not in error state.
CQE recovery on TX reporter queries the sq state. If the sq is not in
error state, the sq is either in ready or reset state. Ready state is
good state which doesn't require recovery and reset state is a temporal
state which ends in ready state. With this patch, CQE recovery in this
scenario is successful.
