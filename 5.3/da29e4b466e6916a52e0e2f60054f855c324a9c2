net/tls: fully initialize the msg wrapper skb

If strparser gets cornered into starting a new message from
an sk_buff which already has frags, it will allocate a new
skb to become the "wrapper" around the fragments of the
message.

This new skb does not inherit any metadata fields.  In case
of TLS offload this may lead to unnecessarily re-encrypting
the message, as skb->decrypted is not set for the wrapper skb.

Try to be conservative and copy all fields of old skb
strparser's user may reasonably need.
