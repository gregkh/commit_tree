powerpc/64s/exception: move and tidy EXCEPTION_PROLOG_2 variants

- Re-name the macros to _REAL and _VIRT suffixes rather than no and
  _RELON suffix.

- Move the macro definitions together in the file.

- Move RELOCATABLE ifdef inside the _VIRT macro.

Further consolidation between variants does not buy much here.

No generated code change.
