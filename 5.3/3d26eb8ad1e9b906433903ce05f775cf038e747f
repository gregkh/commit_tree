net: bridge: don't cache ether dest pointer on input

We would cache ether dst pointer on input in br_handle_frame_finish but
after the neigh suppress code that could lead to a stale pointer since
both ipv4 and ipv6 suppress code do pskb_may_pull. This means we have to
always reload it after the suppress code so there's no point in having
it cached just retrieve it directly.
