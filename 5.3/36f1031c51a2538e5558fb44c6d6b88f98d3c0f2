ibmvnic: Do not process reset during or after device removal

Currently, the ibmvnic driver will not schedule device resets
if the device is being removed, but does not check the device
state before the reset is actually processed. This leads to a race
where a reset is scheduled with a valid device state but is
processed after the driver has been removed, resulting in an oops.

Fix this by checking the device state before processing a queued
reset event.
