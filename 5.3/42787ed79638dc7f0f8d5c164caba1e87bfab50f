ACPI: PM: Fix regression in acpi_device_set_power()

Commit f850a48a0799 ("ACPI: PM: Allow transitions to D0 to occur in
special cases") overlooked the fact that acpi_power_transition() may
change the power.state value for the target device and if that
happens, it may confuse acpi_device_set_power() and cause it to
omit the _PS0 evaluation which on some systems is necessary to
change power states of devices from low-power to D0.

Fix that by saving the current value of power.state for the
target device before passing it to acpi_power_transition() and
using the saved value in a subsequent check.
