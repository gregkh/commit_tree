    fbmem: make read/write/ioctl use the frame buffer at open time

fbdev has gained proper refcounting for the fbinfo attached to any
open files, which means that the backing driver (stored in
fb_info->fbops) cannot untimely disappear anymore.

The only thing that can happen is that the entire device just outright
disappears and gets unregistered, but file_fb_info does check for
that. Except that it's racy - it only checks once at the start of a
file_ops, there's no guarantee that the underlying fbdev won't
untimely disappear. Aside: A proper way to fix that race is probably
to replicate the srcu trickery we've rolled out in drm.

But given that this race has existed since forever it's probably not
one we need to fix right away. do_unregister_framebuffer also nowhere
clears fb_info->fbops, hence the check in lock_fb_info can't possible
catch a disappearing fbdev later on.

Long story short: Ever since the above commit the fb_info->fbops
checks have essentially become dead code. Remove this all.

Aside from the file_ops callbacks, and stuff called from there
there's only register/unregister code left. If that goes wrong a driver
managed to register/unregister a device instance twice or in the wrong
order.  That's just a driver bug.

v2:
- fb_mmap had an open-coded version of the fbinfo->fops check, because
  it doesn't need the fbinfo->lock. Delete that too.
- Use the wrapper function in fb_open/release now, since no difference
  anymore.
