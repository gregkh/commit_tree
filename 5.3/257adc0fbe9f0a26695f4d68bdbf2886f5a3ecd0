USB: core: Fix compiler warnings in devio.c

In the current kernel, devio.c generates a number of compiler warnings
about taking the address of a member of a packed structure.  The
warnings all look like this one:

	drivers/usb/core/devio.c: In function ‘proc_do_submiturb’:
	drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1489:43: warning: taking address of packed member of ‘struct usb_ctrlrequest’ may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Waddress-of-packed-member]
	 1489 |   if (uurb->buffer_length < (le16_to_cpup(&dr->wLength) + 8)) {
	      |                                           ^~~~~~~~~~~~

These warnings can easily be eliminated by changing various
le16_to_cpup() calls to use le16_to_cpu() instead.
