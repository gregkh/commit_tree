x86/stackframe/32: Provide consistent pt_regs

Currently pt_regs on x86_32 has an oddity in that kernel regs
(!user_mode(regs)) are short two entries (esp/ss). This means that any
code trying to use them (typically: regs->sp) needs to jump through
some unfortunate hoops.

Change the entry code to fix this up and create a full pt_regs frame.

This then simplifies various trampolines in ftrace and kprobes, the
stack unwinder, ptrace, kdump and kgdb.

Much thanks to Josh for help with the cleanups!
