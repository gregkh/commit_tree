net: hns3: remove override_pci_need_reset

We add override_pci_need_reset to prevent redundant and unwanted PF
resets if a RAS error occurs in commit 69b51bbb03f7 ("net: hns3: fix
to stop multiple HNS reset due to the AER changes").

Now in HNS3 driver, we use hw_err_reset_req to record reset level that
we need to recover from a RAS error. This variable cans solve above
issue as override_pci_need_reset, so this patch removes
override_pci_need_reset.
