fs: afs: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in afs_put_read()

In afs_read_dir(), there is an if statement on line 255 to check whether
req->pages is NULL:
	if (!req->pages)
		goto error;

If req->pages is NULL, afs_put_read() on line 337 is executed.
In afs_put_read(), req->pages[i] is used on line 195.
Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur in this case.

To fix this possible bug, an if statement is added in afs_put_read() to
check req->pages.

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
