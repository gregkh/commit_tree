perf session: Fix loading of compressed data split across adjacent records

Fix decompression failure found during the loading of compressed trace
collected on larger scale systems (>48 cores).

The error happened due to lack of decompression space for a mmaped
buffer data chunk split across adjacent PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED records.

  $ perf report -i bt.16384.data --stats
  failed to decompress (B): 63869 -> 0 : Destination buffer is too small
  user stack dump failure
  Can't parse sample, err = -14
  0x2637e436 [0x4080]: failed to process type: 9
  Error:
  failed to process sample

  $ perf test 71
  71: Zstd perf.data compression/decompression              : Ok
