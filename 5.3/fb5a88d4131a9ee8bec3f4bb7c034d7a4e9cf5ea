perf tools: Preserve eBPF maps when loading kcore

We need to preserve eBPF maps even if they are covered by kcore, because
we need to access eBPF dso for source data.

Add the map_groups__merge_in function to do that.  It merges a map into
map_groups by splitting the new map within the existing map regions.
