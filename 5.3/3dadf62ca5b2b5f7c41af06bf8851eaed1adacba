staging: rtl8723bs: os_dep: Modify return type of function loadparam(..) to void

The function static uint loadparam(struct adapter *padapter, _nic_hdl
pnetdev) return type is modified to void.
The initial return value was always returning _SUCCESS and the return value
is never checked when the function is called.
This resolves coccicheck warnings of unneeded variables.
