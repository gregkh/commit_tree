ARM: dts: imx7d-sdb: Assign corresponding power supply for LDOs

On i.MX7D SDB board, sw2 supplies 1p0d/1p2 LDO, this patch assigns
corresponding power supply for 1p0d/1p2 LDO to avoid confusion by
below log:

vdd1p0d: supplied by regulator-dummy
vdd1p2: supplied by regulator-dummy

With this patch, the power supply is more accurate:

vdd1p0d: supplied by SW2
vdd1p2: supplied by SW2
