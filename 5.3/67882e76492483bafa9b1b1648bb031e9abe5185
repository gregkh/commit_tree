crypto: xxhash - Implement xxhash support

xxhash is currently implemented as a self-contained module in /lib.
This patch enables that module to be used as part of the generic kernel
crypto framework. It adds a simple wrapper to the 64bit version.

I've also added test vectors (with help from Nick Terrell). The upstream
xxhash code is tested by running hashing operation on random 222 byte
data with seed values of 0 and a prime number. The upstream test
suite can be found at https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/blob/cf46e0c/xxhsum.c#L664

Essentially hashing is run on data of length 0,1,14,222 with the
aforementioned seed values 0 and prime 2654435761. The particular random
222 byte string was provided to me by Nick Terrell by reading
/dev/random and the checksums were calculated by the upstream xxsum
utility with the following bash script:

dd if=/dev/random of=TEST_VECTOR bs=1 count=222

for a in 0 1; do
	for l in 0 1 14 222; do
		for s in 0 2654435761; do
			echo algo $a length $l seed $s;
			head -c $l TEST_VECTOR | ~/projects/kernel/xxHash/xxhsum -H$a -s$s
		done
	done
done

This produces output as follows:

algo 0 length 0 seed 0
02cc5d05  stdin
algo 0 length 0 seed 2654435761
02cc5d05  stdin
algo 0 length 1 seed 0

algo 0 length 1 seed 2654435761

algo 0 length 14 seed 0

5f3d3c08ec2bef34  stdin
algo 1 length 222 seed 2654435761
6a9df59664c7ed62  stdin

algo 1 is xx64 variant, algo 0 is the 32 bit variant which is currently
not hooked up.
