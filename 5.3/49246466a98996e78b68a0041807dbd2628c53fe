fsnotify: move fsnotify_nameremove() hook out of d_delete()

d_delete() was piggy backed for the fsnotify_nameremove() hook when
in fact not all callers of d_delete() care about fsnotify events.

For all callers of d_delete() that may be interested in fsnotify events,
we made sure to call one of fsnotify_{unlink,rmdir}() hooks before
calling d_delete().

Now we can move the fsnotify_nameremove() call from d_delete() to the
fsnotify_{unlink,rmdir}() hooks.

Two explicit calls to fsnotify_nameremove() from nfs/afs sillyrename
are also removed. This will cause a change of behavior - nfs/afs will
NOT generate an fsnotify delete event when renaming over a positive
dentry.  This change is desirable, because it is consistent with the
behavior of all other filesystems.
