atm: iphase: Fix Spectre v1 vulnerability

board is controlled by user-space, hence leading to a potential
exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

drivers/atm/iphase.c:2765 ia_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'ia_dev' [r] (local cap)
drivers/atm/iphase.c:2774 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'
drivers/atm/iphase.c:2782 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'
drivers/atm/iphase.c:2816 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'
drivers/atm/iphase.c:2823 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'
drivers/atm/iphase.c:2830 ia_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue '_ia_dev' [r] (local cap)
drivers/atm/iphase.c:2845 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'
drivers/atm/iphase.c:2856 ia_ioctl() warn: possible spectre second half.  'iadev'

Fix this by sanitizing board before using it to index ia_dev and _ia_dev

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
