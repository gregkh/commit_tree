x86/umwait: Fix error handling in umwait_init()

Currently, failure of cpuhp_setup_state() is ignored and the syscore ops
and the control interfaces can still be added even after the failure. But,
this error handling will cause a few issues:

1. The CPUs may have different values in the IA32_UMWAIT_CONTROL
   MSR because there is no way to roll back the control MSR on
   the CPUs which already set the MSR before the failure.

2. If the sysfs interface is added successfully, there will be a mismatch
   between the global control value and the control MSR:
   - The interface shows the default global control value. But,
     the control MSR is not set to the value because the CPU online
     function, which is supposed to set the MSR to the value,
     is not installed.
   - If the sysadmin changes the global control value through
     the interface, the control MSR on all current online CPUs is
     set to the new value. But, the control MSR on newly onlined CPUs
     after the value change will not be set to the new value due to
     lack of the CPU online function.

3. On resume from suspend/hibernation, the boot CPU restores the control
   MSR to the global control value through the syscore ops. But, the
   control MSR on all APs is not set due to lake of the CPU online
   function.

To solve the issues and enforce consistent behavior on the failure
of the CPU hotplug setup, make the following changes:

1. Cache the original control MSR value which is configured by
   hardware or BIOS before kernel boot. This value is likely to
   be 0. But it could be a different number as well. Cache the
   control MSR only once before the MSR is changed.
2. Add the CPU offline function so that the MSR is restored to the
   original control value on all CPUs on the failure.
3. On the failure, exit from cpumait_init() so that the syscore ops
   and the control interfaces are not added.
