pwm: meson: Use GENMASK and FIELD_PREP for the lo and hi values

meson_pwm_calc() ensures that "lo" is always less than 16 bits wide
(otherwise it would overflow into the "hi" part of the REG_PWM_{A,B}
register).
Use GENMASK and FIELD_PREP for the lo and hi values to make it easier to
spot how wide these are internally. Additionally this is a preparation
step for the .get_state() implementation where the GENMASK() for lo and
hi becomes handy because it can be used with FIELD_GET() to extract the
values from the register REG_PWM_{A,B} register.

No functional changes intended.
