dmaengine: ti: dma-crossbar: Fix a memory leak bug

In ti_dra7_xbar_probe(), 'rsv_events' is allocated through kcalloc(). Then
of_property_read_u32_array() is invoked to search for the property.
However, if this process fails, 'rsv_events' is not deallocated, leading to
a memory leak bug. To fix this issue, free 'rsv_events' before returning
the error.
