docs: target: convert docs to ReST and rename to *.rst

Convert the TCM docs to ReST format and add them to the
bookset.

This has a mix of userspace-faced and Kernelspace faced
docs. Still, it sounds a better candidate to be added at
the kernel API set of docs.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
