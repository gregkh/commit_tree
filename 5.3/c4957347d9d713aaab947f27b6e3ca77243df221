drm/msm/dpu: Use provided drm_minor to initialize debugfs

Instead of reaching into dev->primary for debugfs_root, use the minor
passed into debugfs_init.

This avoids creating the debug directory under /sys/kernel/debug/ and
instead creates the directory under the correct node in
/sys/kernel/debug/dri/<node>/
