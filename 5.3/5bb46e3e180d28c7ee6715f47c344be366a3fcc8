xfs: create iterator error codes

Currently, xfs doesn't have generic error codes defined for "stop
iterating"; we just reuse the XFS_BTREE_QUERY_* return values.  This
looks a little weird if we're not actually iterating a btree index.
Before we start adding more iterators, we should create general
XFS_ITER_{CONTINUE,ABORT} return values and define the XFS_BTREE_QUERY_*
ones from that.
