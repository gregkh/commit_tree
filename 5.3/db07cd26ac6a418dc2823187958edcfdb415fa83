crypto: drbg - add FIPS 140-2 CTRNG for noise source

FIPS 140-2 section 4.9.2 requires a continuous self test of the noise
source. Up to kernel 4.8 drivers/char/random.c provided this continuous
self test. Afterwards it was moved to a location that is inconsistent
with the FIPS 140-2 requirements. The relevant patch was
e192be9d9a30555aae2ca1dc3aad37cba484cd4a .

Thus, the FIPS 140-2 CTRNG is added to the DRBG when it obtains the
seed. This patch resurrects the function drbg_fips_continous_test that
existed some time ago and applies it to the noise sources. The patch
that removed the drbg_fips_continous_test was
b3614763059b82c26bdd02ffcb1c016c1132aad0 .

The Jitter RNG implements its own FIPS 140-2 self test and thus does not
need to be subjected to the test in the DRBG.

The patch contains a tiny fix to ensure proper zeroization in case of an
error during the Jitter RNG data gathering.
