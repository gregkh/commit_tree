scsi: qla2xxx: Fix gnl.l memory leak on adapter init failure

If HBA initialization fails unexpectedly (exiting via probe_failed:), we
may fail to free vha->gnl.l. So that we don't attempt to double free, set
this pointer to NULL after a free and check for NULL at probe_failed: so we
know whether or not to call dma_free_coherent.
