scsi: hpsa: correct device resets

Correct a race condition that occurs between the reset handler and the
completion handler. There are times when the wait_event condition is
never met due to this race condition and the reset never completes.

The reset_pending field is NULL initially.

  t  Reset Handler Thread     Completion Thread
  -- --------------------     -----------------
  t1                          if (c->reset_pending)
  t2 c->reset_pending = dev;     if (atomic_dev_and_test(counter))
  t3 atomic_inc(counter)             wait_up_all(event_sync_wait_queue)
  t4
  t5 wait_event(...counter == 0)
