blkcg: perpcu_ref init/exit should be done from blkg_alloc/free()

blkg alloc is performed as a separate step from the rest of blkg
creation so that GFP_KERNEL allocations can be used when creating
blkgs from configuration file writes because otherwise user actions
may fail due to failures of opportunistic GFP_NOWAIT allocations.

While making blkgs use percpu_ref, 7fcf2b033b84 ("blkcg: change blkg
reference counting to use percpu_ref") incorrectly added unconditional
opportunistic percpu_ref_init() to blkg_create() breaking this
guarantee.

This patch moves percpu_ref_init() to blkg_alloc() so makes it use
@gfp_mask that blkg_alloc() is called with.  Also, percpu_ref_exit()
is moved to blkg_free() for consistency.
