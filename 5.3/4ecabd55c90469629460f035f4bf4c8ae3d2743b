bpf: allow CGROUP_SKB programs to use bpf_skb_cgroup_id() helper

Currently bpf_skb_cgroup_id() is not supported for CGROUP_SKB
programs. An attempt to load such a program generates an error
like this:

    libbpf:
    0: (b7) r6 = 0
    ...
    9: (85) call bpf_skb_cgroup_id#79
    unknown func bpf_skb_cgroup_id#79

There are no particular reasons for denying it, and we have some
use cases where it might be useful.

So let's add it to the list of allowed helpers.
