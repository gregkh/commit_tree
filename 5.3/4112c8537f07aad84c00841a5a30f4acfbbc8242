nvmem: imx-ocotp: Add i.MX8MM support

This patch adds support to burn the fuses on the i.MX8MM.

The i.MX8MM is similar to i.MX6 processors in terms of addressing and clock
setup.

The documentation specifies 60 discreet OTP registers but, the fusemap
address space encompasses up to 256 registers. We map the entire putative
256 OTP registers.
