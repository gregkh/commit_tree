x86/stacktrace: Prevent infinite loop in arch_stack_walk_user()

arch_stack_walk_user() checks `if (fp == frame.next_fp)` to prevent a
infinite loop by self reference but it's not enogh for circular reference.

Once a lack of return address is found, there is no point to continue the
loop, so break out.
