bnx2x: Fix VF's VLAN reconfiguration in reload.

Commit 04f05230c5c13 ("bnx2x: Remove configured vlans as
part of unload sequence."), introduced a regression in driver
that as a part of VF's reload flow, VLANs created on the VF
doesn't get re-configured in hardware as vlan metadata/info
was not getting cleared for the VFs which causes vlan PING to stop.

This patch clears the vlan metadata/info so that VLANs gets
re-configured back in the hardware in VF's reload flow and
PING/traffic continues for VLANs created over the VFs.
