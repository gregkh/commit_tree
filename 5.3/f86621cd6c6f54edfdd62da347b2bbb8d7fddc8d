SoC: rockchip: rockchip_max98090: Enable MICBIAS for headset keypress detection

The TS3A227E says that the headset keypress detection needs the MICBIAS
power in order to report the key events to ensure proper operation
The headset keypress detection needs the MICBIAS power in order to report
the key events all the time as long as MIC is present. So MICBIAS pin
is forced on when a MICROPHONE is detected.

On Veyron Minnie I observed that if the MICBIAS power is not present and
the key press detection is activated (just because it is enabled when you
insert a headset), it randomly reports a keypress on insert.
E.g. (KEY_PLAYPAUSE)

 Event: (SW_HEADPHONE_INSERT), value 1
 Event: (SW_MICROPHONE_INSERT), value 1
 Event: -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
 Event: (KEY_PLAYPAUSE), value 1

Userspace thinks that KEY_PLAYPAUSE is pressed and produces the annoying
effect that the media player starts a play/pause loop.

Note that, although most of the time the key reported is the one
associated with BTN_0, not always this is true. On my tests I also saw
different keys reported
