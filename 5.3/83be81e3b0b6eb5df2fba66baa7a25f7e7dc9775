ARM: dts: rockchip: raise CPU trip point temperature for veyron to 100 degC

This value matches what is used by the downstream Chrome OS 3.14
kernel, the 'official' kernel for veyron devices. Keep the temperature
for 'speedy' at 90°C, as in the downstream kernel.

Increase the temperature for a hardware shutdown to 125°C, which
matches the downstream configuration and gives the system a chance
to shut down orderly at the criticial trip point.
