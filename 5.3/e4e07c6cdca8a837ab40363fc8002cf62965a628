ALSA: hdspm: Fix single speed ADAT capture and playback with RME HDSPe AIO

By taking into account the mapping from logical to DMA channels when
enabling or disabling audio channels, ADAT channels 3 to 8 on the RME
HDSPe AIO card are now correctly captured and played back in single speed
mode.

Since the mapping is an identity mapping for all cards except AIO and
RayDAT, only those cards should be affected by this patch. It was tested on
an AIO card. The patch needs testing on other cards, in particular RayDAT.

Note: this patch does not solve ADAT capture and playback issues in double
or triple speed mode. That seems to be another problem.
