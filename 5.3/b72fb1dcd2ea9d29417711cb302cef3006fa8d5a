HID: wacom: Correct distance scale for 2nd-gen Intuos devices

Distance values reported by 2nd-gen Intuos tablets are on an inverted
scale (0 == far, 63 == near). We need to change them over to a normal
scale before reporting to userspace or else userspace drivers and
applications can get confused.
