platform/x86: mlx-platform: Modify DMI matching order

Modify DMI matching order: perform matching based on  DMI_BOARD_NAME
before matching based on DMI_BOARD_VENDOR and DMI_PRODUCT_NAME in order
to reduce the number of ‘dmi_table’ entries necessary for new systems
support and keep matching order in logical way.

For example, the existing check for DMI_PRODUCT_NAME with prefixes
“MSN27", “MSN24”, "MSB” matches systems MSN2700-BXXXX, MSN2700-XXXX,
MSN2410-BXXXX, MSB7800-XXXX, where ‘XXXX’ specifies some systems
hardware flavors.
At the same time these systems also matched by DMI_BOARD_NAME
“VMOD0001”, because they all have the same platform configuration (LED,
interrupt control, mux etcetera).
New systems with different platform configuration, but with similar
DMI_PRODUCT_NAME  MSN2700-2XXXX, MSN2700-2XXXX, MSB7800-2XXXX are about
to be added. These system have similar DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, since they
have same ports configuration as their predecessors. All new systems
will be matched by DMI_BOARD_NAME “VMOD0008”.
With the change provided in the patch it is enough just to add
“VMOD0008” match following natural after “VMOD0007”, otherwise
“VMOD0008” or all “MSN2700-2XXXX”, “MSN2700-2XXXX”, “MSB7800-2XXXX”
should be added on top of ‘mlxplat_dmi_table” in order to be matched
before “MSN27", “MSN24”, "MSB”.
