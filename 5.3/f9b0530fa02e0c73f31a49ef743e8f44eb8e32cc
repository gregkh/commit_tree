scsi: core: Fix race on creating sense cache

When scsi_init_sense_cache(host) is called concurrently from different
hosts, each code path may find that no cache has been created and
allocate a new one. The lack of locking can lead to potentially
overriding a cache allocated by a different host.

Fix the issue by moving 'mutex_lock(&scsi_sense_cache_mutex)' before
scsi_select_sense_cache().
