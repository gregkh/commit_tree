arm64: Lower priority mask for GIC_PRIO_IRQON

On a system with two security states, if SCR_EL3.FIQ is cleared,
non-secure IRQ priorities get shifted to fit the secure view but
priority masks aren't.

On such system, it turns out that GIC_PRIO_IRQON masks the priority of
normal interrupts, which obviously ends up in a hang.

Increase GIC_PRIO_IRQON value (i.e. lower priority) to make sure
interrupts are not blocked by it.
