block: Fix elevator name declaration

The elevator_name field in struct elevator_type is declared as an array
of characters (ELV_NAME_MAX size) but in practice used as a string
pointer with its initialization done statically within each
elevator elevator_type structure declaration.

Change the declaration of elevator_name to the more appropriate
"const char *" type.
