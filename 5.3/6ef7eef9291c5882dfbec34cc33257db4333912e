staging: ks7010: Merge multiple return variables in ks_hostif.c

The function hostif_data_request had two return variables, ret and
result. When ret is assigned a value, in all cases (except one) this
assignment is followed immediately by a goto to the end of the
function. In the last case, the goto takes effect only if ret < 0;
however, if ret >= 0 then this value of ret is not needed in the
remainder of that branch. On the other hand result is used (assigned a
value and returned) only in those branches where ret >= 0 or ret has
not been used at all.
As the values of ret and result are not both required at the same point
in any branch, result can be removed and its occurrences replaced with
ret.
