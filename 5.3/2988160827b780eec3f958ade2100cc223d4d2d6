afs: fsclient: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

fs/afs/fsclient.c: In function ‘afs_deliver_fs_fetch_acl’:
fs/afs/fsclient.c:2199:19: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
