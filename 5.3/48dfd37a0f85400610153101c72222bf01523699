ASoC: cs42xx8: Fix MFREQ selection issue for async mode

When sample rate of TX is different with sample rate of RX in
async mode, the MFreq selection will be wrong.

For example, sysclk = 24.576MHz, TX rate = 96000Hz, RX rate = 48000Hz.
Then ratio of TX = 256, ratio of RX = 512, For MFreq is shared by TX
and RX instance, the correct value of MFreq is 2 for both TX and RX.

But original method will cause MFreq = 0 for TX, MFreq = 2 for RX.
If TX is started after RX, RX will be impacted, RX work abnormal with
MFreq = 0.

This patch is to select proper MFreq value according to TX rate and
RX rate.
