gpio: of: fix Freescale SPI CS quirk handling

On the gta04 we see:
spi_gpio: probe of spi_lcd failed with error -2

The quirk introduced in
commit e3023bf80639 ("gpio: of: Handle the Freescale SPI CS")
can also be triggered by a temporary -EPROBE_DEFER and
so "convert" it to a hard -ENOENT.

Disable that conversion by checking for -EPROBE_DEFER.
