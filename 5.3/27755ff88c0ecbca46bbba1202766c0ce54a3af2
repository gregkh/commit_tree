net: phylink: Add phylink_mac_link_{up, down} wrapper functions

This is a cosmetic patch that reduces the clutter in phylink_resolve
around calling the .mac_link_up/.mac_link_down driver callbacks.  In a
further patch this logic will be extended to emit notifications in case
a net device does not exist.
