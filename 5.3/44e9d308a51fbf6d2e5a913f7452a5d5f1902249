kselftests: cgroup: add freezer mkdir test

Add a new cgroup freezer selftest, which checks that if a cgroup is
frozen, their new child cgroups will properly inherit the frozen
state.

It creates a parent cgroup, freezes it, creates a child cgroup
and populates it with a dummy process. Then it checks that both
parent and child cgroup are frozen.
