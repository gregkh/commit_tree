net: dsa: tag_sja1105: Select CONFIG_PACKING

The packing facility is needed to decode Ethernet meta frames containing
source port and RX timestamping information.

The DSA driver selects CONFIG_PACKING, but the tagger did not, and since
taggers can be now compiled as modules independently from the drivers
themselves, this is an issue now, as CONFIG_PACKING is disabled by
default on all architectures.
