ASoC: rockchip: Fix mono capture

This reverts commit db51707b9c9aeedd310ebce60f15d5bb006567e0.
Revert "ASoC: rockchip: i2s: Support mono capture"

Previous discussion in

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10147153/

explains the issue of the patch.
While device is configured as 1-ch, hardware is still
generating a 2-ch stream.
When user space reads the data and assumes it is a 1-ch stream,
the rate will be slower by 2x.

Revert the change so 1-ch is not supported.
User space can selectively take one channel data out of two channel
if 1-ch is preferred.
Currently, both channels record identical data.
