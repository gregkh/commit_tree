media: aspeed: refine clock control logic

Currently, this driver calls clk_prepare and clk_unprepare from
interrupt context too but these should be called from sleepable
context only. To fix this issue, this commit splits out
clk_enable/disable and clk_prepare/unprepare, and it places
clk_prepare/unprepare calls into the module probe/remove function.
