ath10k: Do not send probe response template for mesh

Currently mac80211 do not support probe response template for
mesh point. When WMI_SERVICE_BEACON_OFFLOAD is enabled, host
driver tries to configure probe response template for mesh, but
it fails because the interface type is not NL80211_IFTYPE_AP but
NL80211_IFTYPE_MESH_POINT.

To avoid this failure, skip sending probe response template to
firmware for mesh point.
