vfio-ccw: Move guest_cp storage into common struct

Rather than allocating/freeing a piece of memory every time
we try to figure out how long a CCW chain is, let's use a piece
of memory allocated for each device.

The io_mutex added with commit 4f76617378ee9 ("vfio-ccw: protect
the I/O region") is held for the duration of the VFIO_CCW_EVENT_IO_REQ
event that accesses/uses this space, so there should be no race
concerns with another CPU attempting an (unexpected) SSCH for the
same device.
