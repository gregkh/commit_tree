drm: rcar-du: lvds: Add support for dual-link mode

In dual-link mode the LVDS0 encoder transmits even-numbered pixels, and
sends odd-numbered pixels to the LVDS1 encoder for transmission on a
separate link.

To implement support for this mode of operation, determine if the LVDS
connection operates in dual-link mode by querying the next device in the
pipeline, locate the companion encoder, and control it directly through
its bridge operations.
