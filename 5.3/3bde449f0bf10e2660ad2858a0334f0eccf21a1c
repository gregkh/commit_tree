drm/edid: Ignore "DFP 1.x" bit for EDID 1.2 and earlier

From VESA EDID implementation guide v1.0:
"For EDID version 1 revision 2 or earlier data structures when offset 14h
 bit 7 is set to one, the value of bits 6-0 are undefined, and therefore
 cannot be interpreted to mean anything."

And since EDID 1.4 redefines that bit let's consult it only for
EDID 1.3.
