ARM: 8861/1: errata: Workaround errata A12 857271 / A17 857272

This adds support for working around errata A12 857271 / A17 857272.
These errata were causing hangs on rk3288-based Chromebooks and it was
confirmed that this workaround fixed the problems.  In the Chrome OS
3.14 kernel this was treated as two errata: ERRATA_FOOBAR [1] and
ERRATA_CR711784 [2].  Apparently the two errata got lumped together at
some point in time.

Let's actually get the workaround landed.
