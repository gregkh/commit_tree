r8152: move calling r8153b_rx_agg_chg_indicate()

r8153b_rx_agg_chg_indicate() needs to be called after enabling TX/RX and
before calling rxdy_gated_en(tp, false). Otherwise, the change of the
settings of RX aggregation wouldn't work.

Besides, adjust rtl8152_set_coalesce() for the same reason. If
rx_coalesce_usecs is changed, restart TX/RX to let the setting work.
