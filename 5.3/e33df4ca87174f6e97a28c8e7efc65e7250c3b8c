    drm/doc: Document expectation that userspace review looks at kernel uAPI.

there's been concerns raised that we expect userspace people to do
in-depth kernel patch review. That's not reasonable, same way kernel
people can't review all the userspace we have. Try to clarify
expectations a bit more.
