clk: rockchip: Remove 48 MHz PLL rate from rk3288

The 48 MHz PLL rate is not present in the downstream chromeos-3.14
tree.  Looking at history, it was originally removed in
<https://crrev.com/c/265810> ("CHROMIUM: clk: rockchip: expand more
clocks support") with no explanation.  Much of that patch was later
reverted in <https://crrev.com/c/284595> ("CHROMIUM: clk: rockchip:
Revert more questionable PLL rates"), but that patch left in the
removal of 48 MHz.  What I wrote in that patch:

> Note that the original change also removed the rate (48000000, 1,
> 64, 32) from the table.  I have no idea why that was squashed in
> there, but that rate was invalid anyway (it appears to have an out
> of bounds NO).  I'm not putting that rate in.

Reading the TRM I see that NO is defined as
- NO: 1, 2-16 (even only)
...and furthermore only 4 bits are assigned for NO-1, which means that
the highest NO we could even represent is 16.
