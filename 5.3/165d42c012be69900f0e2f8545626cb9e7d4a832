drm/mediatek: mtk_drm_drv.c: Add of_node_put() before goto

Each iteration of for_each_child_of_node puts the previous
node, but in the case of a goto from the middle of the loop, there is
no put, thus causing a memory leak. Hence add an of_node_put before the
goto in two places.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
