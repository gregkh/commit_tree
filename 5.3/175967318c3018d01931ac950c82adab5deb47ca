mm: introduce ARCH_HAS_PTE_DEVMAP

ARCH_HAS_ZONE_DEVICE is somewhat meaningless in itself, and combined
with the long-out-of-date comment can lead to the impression than an
architecture may just enable it (since __add_pages() now "comprehends
device memory" for itself) and expect things to work.

In practice, however, ZONE_DEVICE users have little chance of
functioning correctly without __HAVE_ARCH_PTE_DEVMAP, so let's clean
that up the same way as ARCH_HAS_PTE_SPECIAL and make it the proper
dependency so the real situation is clearer.
