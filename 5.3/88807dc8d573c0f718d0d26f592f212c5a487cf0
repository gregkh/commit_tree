drm/amdgpu: Remap hdp coherency registers

Remap HDP_MEM_COHERENCY_FLUSH_CNTL and HDP_REG_COHERENCY_FLUSH_CNTL
to an empty page in mmio space. We will later map this page to process
space so application can flush hdp. This can't be done properly at
those registers' original location because it will expose more than
desired registers to process space.

v2: Use explicit register hole location
v3: Moved remapped hdp registers into adev struct
v4: Use more generic name for remapped page
    Expose register offset in kfd_ioctl.h
v5: Move hdp register remap function to nbio ip function
v6: Fixed operator precedence issue and other bugs
