arm64: Allow user selection of ARM64_MODULE_PLTS

Make ARM64_MODULE_PLTS a selectable Kconfig symbol, since some people
might have very big modules spilling out of the dedicated module area
into vmalloc. Help text is copied from the ARM 32-bit counterpart and
modified to a mention of KASLR and specific ARM errata workaround(s).
