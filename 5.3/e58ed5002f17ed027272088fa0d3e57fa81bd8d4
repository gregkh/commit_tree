scsi: megaraid_sas: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding the
size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along with
memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct MR_PD_CFG_SEQ_NUM_SYNC {
	...
        struct MR_PD_CFG_SEQ seq[1];
} __packed;

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version in
order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(struct MR_PD_CFG_SEQ_NUM_SYNC) + (sizeof(struct MR_PD_CFG_SEQ) * (MAX_PHYSICAL_DEVICES - 1))

with:

struct_size(pd_sync, seq, MAX_PHYSICAL_DEVICES - 1)
