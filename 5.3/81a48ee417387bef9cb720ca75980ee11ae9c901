RISC-V: Remove udivdi3

This should never have landed in the first place: it was added as part
of 64-bit divide support for 32-bit systems, but the kernel doesn't
allow this sort of division.  I must have forgotten to remove it.

This patch removes the support.  Since this routine only worked on
64-bit platforms but was only built on 32-bit platforms, it's
essentially just nonsense anyway.
