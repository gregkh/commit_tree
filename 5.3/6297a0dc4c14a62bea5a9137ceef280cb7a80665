ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: modify stream interrupt handler

Modify the stream interrupt handler to always wake up the
IRQ thread if the status register is valid. The IRQ thread
performs the check for stream interrupts and RIRB interrupts
in a loop to handle the case of missed interrupts when an
unsolicited response from the codec is received just before the
stream interrupt handler is completed.
