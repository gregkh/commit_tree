xen/swiotlb: simplify range_straddles_page_boundary()

range_straddles_page_boundary() is open coding several macros from
include/xen/page.h. Use those instead. Additionally there is no need
to have check_pages_physically_contiguous() as a separate function as
it is used only once, so merge it into range_straddles_page_boundary().
