ASoC: Remove erroneous soc_cleanup_card_resources() call

When soc_init_dai_link() call at the beginning of snd_soc_instantiate_card
function fails soc_cleanup_card_resources() and then snd_soc_dapm_free()
gets called with an incompletely initialized card->dapm. In particular
card->dapm.card is NULL and it gets dereferenced in dapm_free_widgets().
Also dapm->list is invalid and there is an invalid pointer dereference
from list_del().

The function call stack (deferred probing) on Chromebook Snow where this
issue has shown up in today's -next is:

 snd_soc_dapm_free
 soc_cleanup_card_resources
 snd_soc_instantiate_card
 snd_soc_register_card
 devm_snd_soc_register_card
 snow_probe

In patch 70fc53734e71 "ASoC: core: move DAI pre-links initiation to
snd_soc_instantiate_card" there is an soc_cleanup_platform() call instead
of soc_cleanup_card_resources() as in current -next.

soc_cleanup_platform got renamed to soc_cleanup_legacy, then removed
in commit adb76b5b9c47 "ASoC: soc-core: remove legacy style dai_link".

It seems in merge conflict resolution the soc_cleanup_platform() call got
renamed to soc_cleanup_card_resources(), instead of being removed.

Correct this by removing an unnecessary soc_cleanup_card_resources() call.
