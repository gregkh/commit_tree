drm: Add drm_gem_vram_fill_create_dumb() to create dumb buffers

The helper function drm_gem_vram_fill_create_dumb() implements most of
struct drm_driver.dumb_create() for GEM-VRAM buffer objects. It's not a
full implementation of the callback, as several driver-specific parameters
are still required.

v4:
	* cleanups from checkpatch.pl
v2:
	* documentation fixes
