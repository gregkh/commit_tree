cpufreq: intel_pstate: Reuse refresh_frequency_limits()

The implementation of intel_pstate_update_max_freq() is quite similar to
refresh_frequency_limits(), lets reuse it.

Finding minimum of policy->user_policy.max and policy->cpuinfo.max_freq
in intel_pstate_update_max_freq() is redundant as cpufreq_set_policy()
will call the ->verify() callback of intel-pstate driver, which will do
this comparison anyway and so dropping it from
intel_pstate_update_max_freq() doesn't harm.
