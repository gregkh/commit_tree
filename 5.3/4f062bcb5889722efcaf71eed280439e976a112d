pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7795-es1: Use new macros for non-GPIO pins

Update the R-Car H3 ES1.x pin control driver to use the new macros for
describing pins without GPIO functionality.  This replaces the use of
physical pin numbers on the R-Car H3 ES1.x SiP (in 39x39 BGA package) by
symbolic enum values, referring to signal names.
