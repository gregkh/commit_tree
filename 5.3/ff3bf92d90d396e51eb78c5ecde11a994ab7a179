torture: Allow inter-stutter interval to be specified

Currently, the inter-stutter interval is the same as the stutter duration,
that is, whatever number of jiffies is passed into torture_stutter_init().
This has worked well for quite some time, but the addition of
forward-progress testing to rcutorture can delay processes for several
seconds, which can triple the time that they are stuttered.

This commit therefore adds a second argument to torture_stutter_init()
that specifies the inter-stutter interval.  While locktorture preserves
the current behavior, rcutorture uses the RCU CPU stall warning interval
to provide a wider inter-stutter interval.
