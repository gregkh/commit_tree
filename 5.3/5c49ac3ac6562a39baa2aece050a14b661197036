media: ov6650: Fix device node exposed without proper locking

Commit c62b96050bee ("media: ov6650: Register with asynchronous
subdevice framework") carelessly requested creation of a video device
node by setting a V4L2_SUBDEV_FL_HAS_DEVNODE flag.  The driver is not
ready for that as it doesn't implement proper locking required for
serialization of IOCTLs.

Fix it by dropping the flag assignment.
