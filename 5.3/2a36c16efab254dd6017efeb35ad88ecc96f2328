ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix the problem of two front mics on a ThinkCentre

This ThinkCentre machine has a new realtek codec alc222, it is not
in the support list, we add it in the realtek.c then this machine
can apply FIXUPs for the realtek codec.

And this machine has two front mics which can't be handled
by PA so far, it uses the pin 0x18 and 0x19 as the front mics, as
a result the existing FIXUP ALC294_FIXUP_LENOVO_MIC_LOCATION doesn't
work on this machine. Fortunately another FIXUP
ALC283_FIXUP_HEADSET_MIC also can change the location for one of the
two mics on this machine.
