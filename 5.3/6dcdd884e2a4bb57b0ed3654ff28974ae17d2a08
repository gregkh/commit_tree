net: hwbm: Make the hwbm_pool lock a mutex

Based on review, `lock' is only acquired in hwbm_pool_add() which is
invoked via ->probe(), ->resume() and ->ndo_change_mtu(). Based on this
the lock can become a mutex and there is no need to disable interrupts
during the procedure.
Now that the lock is a mutex, hwbm_pool_add() no longer invokes
hwbm_pool_refill() in an atomic context so we can pass GFP_KERNEL to
hwbm_pool_refill() and remove the `gfp' argument from hwbm_pool_add().
