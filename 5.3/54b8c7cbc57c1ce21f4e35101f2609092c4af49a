arm64/fpsimd: Introduce fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() and use it

The only external user of fpsimd_save() and fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() is
the KVM FPSIMD code.

A following patch will introduce a mechanism to acquire owernship of the
FPSIMD/SVE context for performing context management operations. Rather
than having to export the new helpers to get/put the context, we can just
introduce a new function to combine fpsimd_save() and
fpsimd_flush_cpu_state().

This has also the advantage to remove any external call of fpsimd_save()
and fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), so they can be turned static.

Lastly, the new function can also be used in the PM notifier.
