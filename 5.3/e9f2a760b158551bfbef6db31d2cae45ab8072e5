KVM: x86: change kvm_mmu_page_get_gfn BUG_ON to WARN_ON

Note that in such a case it is quite likely that KVM will BUG_ON
in __pte_list_remove when the VM is closed.  However, there is no
immediate risk of memory corruption in the host so a WARN_ON is
enough and it lets you gather traces for debugging.
