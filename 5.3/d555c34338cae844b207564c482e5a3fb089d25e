omap-dma/omap_vout_vrfb: fix off-by-one fi value

The OMAP 4 TRM specifies that when using double-index addressing
the address increases by the ES plus the EI value minus 1 within
a frame. When a full frame is transferred, the address increases
by the ES plus the frame index (FI) value minus 1.

The omap-dma code didn't account for the 'minus 1' in the FI register.
To get correct addressing, add 1 to the src_icg value.

This was found when testing a hacked version of the media m2m-deinterlace.c
driver on a Pandaboard.

The only other source that uses this feature is omap_vout_vrfb.c,
and that adds a + 1 when setting the dst_icg. This is a workaround
for the broken omap-dma.c behavior. So remove the workaround at the
same time that we fix omap-dma.c.

I tested the omap_vout driver with a Beagle XM board to check that
the '+ 1' in omap_vout_vrfb.c was indeed a workaround for the omap-dma
bug.
