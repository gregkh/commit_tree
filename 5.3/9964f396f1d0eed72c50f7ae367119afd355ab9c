s390: fix setting of mio addressing control

Move enablement of mio addressing control from detect_machine_facilities
to pci_base_init. detect_machine_facilities runs so early that the
static branches have not been toggled yet, thus mio addressing control
was always off. In pci_base_init we have to use the SMP aware
ctl_set_bit though.
