ipv6: export function to send route updates

Add fib6_rt_update to send RTM_NEWROUTE with NLM_F_REPLACE set. This
helper will be used by the nexthop code to notify userspace of routes
that are impacted when a nexthop config is updated via replace.

This notification is needed for legacy apps that do not understand
the new nexthop object. Apps that are nexthop aware can use the
RTA_NH_ID attribute in the route notification to just ignore it.

In the future this should be wrapped in a sysctl to allow OS'es that
are fully updated to avoid the notificaton storm.
