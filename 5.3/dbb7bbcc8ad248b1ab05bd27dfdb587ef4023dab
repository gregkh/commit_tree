PCI: endpoint: Clear BAR before freeing its space

Associated pci_epf_bar structure is needed in pci_epc_clear_bar() to
clear a BAR correctly but it is reset in pci_epf_free_space() (that
is called first) which results in pci_epc_clear_bar() failure.

Reorder the pci_epc_clear_bar()/pci_epf_free_space() calls execution
to fix the issue.
