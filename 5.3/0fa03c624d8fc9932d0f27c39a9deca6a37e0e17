io_uring: add support for sendmsg()

This is done through IORING_OP_SENDMSG. There's a new sqe->msg_flags
for the flags argument, and the msghdr struct is passed in the
sqe->addr field.

We use MSG_DONTWAIT to force an inline fast path if sendmsg() doesn't
block, and punt to async execution if it would have.
