arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404-evb: Mark CDSP clocks protected

With the Trustzone based CDSP remoteproc driver these clocks are
controlled elsewhere and as they are not enabled by anything in Linux
the clock framework will turn them off during lateinit.

This results in issues either to later start the CDSP, using the
Trustzone interface, or if the CDSP is already running it will crash.
