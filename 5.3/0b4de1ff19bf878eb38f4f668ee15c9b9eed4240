nfp: bpf: eliminate zero extension code-gen

This patch eliminate zero extension code-gen for instructions including
both alu and load/store. The only exception is for ctx load, because
offload target doesn't go through host ctx convert logic so we do
customized load and ignores zext flag set by verifier.
