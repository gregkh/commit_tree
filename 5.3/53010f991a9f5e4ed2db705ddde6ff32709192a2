nexthop: Add support for IPv6 gateways

Handle IPv6 gateway in a nexthop spec. If nh_family is set to AF_INET6,
NHA_GATEWAY is expected to be an IPv6 address. Add ipv6 option to gw in
nh_config to hold the address, add fib6_nh to nh_info to leverage the
ipv6 initialization and cleanup code. Update nh_fill_node to dump the v6
address.
