drm/modes: Allow to specify rotation and reflection on the commandline

Rotations and reflections setup are needed in some scenarios to initialise
properly the initial framebuffer. Some drivers already had a bunch of
quirks to deal with this, such as either a private kernel command line
parameter (omapdss) or on the device tree (various panels).

In order to accomodate this, let's create a video mode parameter to deal
with the rotation and reflexion.
