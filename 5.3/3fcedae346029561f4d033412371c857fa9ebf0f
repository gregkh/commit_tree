media: vivid: remove unnecessary min and max timeperframe constants

The tpf_min (1/100) and tpf_max (100/1) are used as the lowest and the
highest allowable value for the desired frame period in
vivid_vid_cap_s_parm().

But the comparison between these values is unnecessary because the compared
value is already chosen from webcam_intervals[] (from 1/60 to 1/1).
