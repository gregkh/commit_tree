drm/bridge: tc358767: move video stream setup to tc_main_link_stream

The driver currently sets the video stream registers in
tc_main_link_setup. One should be able to establish the DP link without
any video stream, so a more logical place is to configure the stream in
the tc_main_link_stream. So move them there.
