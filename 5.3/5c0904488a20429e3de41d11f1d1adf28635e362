pinctrl: mediatek: Add pm_ops to pinctrl-paris

pinctrl variants that include pinctrl-paris.h (and not
pinctrl-mtk-common.h) also need to use pm_ops to setup
wake mask properly, so copy over the pm_ops from common
to paris variant.

It is not easy to merge the 2 copies (or move
mtk_eint_suspend/resume to mtk-eint.c), as we need to
dereference pctrl->eint, and struct mtk_pinctrl *pctl has a
different structure definition for v1 and v2 (which is
what paris variant uses).
