drm/i915: fix whitelist selftests with readonly registers

When a register is readonly there is not much we can tell about its
value (apart from its default value?). This can be covered by tests
exercising the value of the register from userspace.

For PS_INVOCATION_COUNT we've got the following piglit tests :

   KHR-GL45.pipeline_statistics_query_tests_ARB.functional_fragment_shader_invocations

Vulkan CTS tests :

   dEQP-VK.query_pool.statistics_query.fragment_shader_invocations.*

v2: Use a local to shrink under 80cols.
