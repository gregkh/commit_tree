clk: raspberrypi: register platform device for raspberrypi-cpufreq

As 'clk-raspberrypi' depends on RPi's firmware interface, which might be
configured as a module, the cpu clock might not be available for the
cpufreq driver during it's init process. So we register the
'raspberrypi-cpufreq' platform device after the probe sequence succeeds.
