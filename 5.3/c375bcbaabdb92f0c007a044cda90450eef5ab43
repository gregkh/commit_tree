pwm: meson: Read the full hardware state in meson_pwm_get_state()

Update the meson_pwm_get_state() implementation to take care of all
information in the registers instead of only reading the "enabled"
state.

The PWM output is only enabled if two conditions are met:
1. the per-channel clock is enabled
2. the PWM output is enabled

Calculate the PWM period and duty cycle using the reverse formula which
we already have in meson_pwm_calc() and update struct pwm_state with the
results.

As result of this /sys/kernel/debug/pwm now shows the PWM state set by
the bootloader (or firmware) after booting Linux.
