block/bio-integrity: fix a memory leak bug

In bio_integrity_prep(), a kernel buffer is allocated through kmalloc() to
hold integrity metadata. Later on, the buffer will be attached to the bio
structure through bio_integrity_add_page(), which returns the number of
bytes of integrity metadata attached. Due to unexpected situations,
bio_integrity_add_page() may return 0. As a result, bio_integrity_prep()
needs to be terminated with 'false' returned to indicate this error.
However, the allocated kernel buffer is not freed on this execution path,
leading to a memory leak.

To fix this issue, free the allocated buffer before returning from
bio_integrity_prep().
