scsi: target: tcmu: avoid use-after-free after command timeout

In tcmu_handle_completion() function, the variable called read_len is
always initialized with a value taken from se_cmd structure. If this
function is called to complete an expired (timed out) out command, the
session command pointed by se_cmd is likely to be already deallocated by
the target core at that moment. As the result, this access triggers a
use-after-free warning from KASAN.

This patch fixes the code not to touch se_cmd when completing timed out
TCMU commands. It also resets the pointer to se_cmd at the time when the
TCMU_CMD_BIT_EXPIRED flag is set because it is going to become invalid
after calling target_complete_cmd() later in the same function,
tcmu_check_expired_cmd().
