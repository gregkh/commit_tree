x86/build: Add -Wnoaddress-of-packed-member to REALMODE_CFLAGS, to silence GCC9 build warning

One of the very few warnings I have in the current build comes from
arch/x86/boot/edd.c, where I get the following with a gcc9 build:

   arch/x86/boot/edd.c: In function ‘query_edd’:
   arch/x86/boot/edd.c:148:11: warning: taking address of packed member of ‘struct boot_params’ may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Waddress-of-packed-member]
     148 |  mbrptr = boot_params.edd_mbr_sig_buffer;
         |           ^~~~~~~~~~~

This warning triggers because we throw away all the CFLAGS and then make
a new set for REALMODE_CFLAGS, so the -Wno-address-of-packed-member we
added in the following commit is not present:

  6f303d60534c ("gcc-9: silence 'address-of-packed-member' warning")

The simplest solution for now is to adjust the warning for this version
of CFLAGS as well, but it would definitely make sense to examine whether
REALMODE_CFLAGS could be derived from CFLAGS, so that it picks up changes
in the compiler flags environment automatically.
