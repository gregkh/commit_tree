drm/amdgpu/{uvd,vcn}: fetch ring's read_ptr after alloc

[What]
readptr read always returns zero, since most likely
these blocks are either power or clock gated.

[How]
fetch rptr after amdgpu_ring_alloc() which informs
the power management code that the block is about to be
used and hence the gating is turned off.
