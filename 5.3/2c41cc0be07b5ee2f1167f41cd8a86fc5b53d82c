media: venus: firmware: fix leaked of_node references

The call to of_parse_phandle returns a node pointer with refcount
incremented thus it must be explicitly decremented after the last
usage.

Detected by coccinelle with the following warnings:
drivers/media/platform/qcom/venus/firmware.c:90:2-8: ERROR: missing of_node_put; acquired a node pointer with refcount incremented on line 82, but without a corresponding object release within this function.
