i2c: bcm2835: Move IRQ request after clock code in probe

If any of the clock code in the probe fails and returns, the IRQ
will not be freed.  Moving the IRQ request to last allows it to
be freed on any errors further up in the probe function.  devm_
calls can apparently not be used because there are some potential
race conditions that will arise.
