KVM: VMX: Shadow VMCS primary execution controls

Prepare to shadow all major control fields on a per-VMCS basis, which
allows KVM to avoid VMREADs when switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02,
and more importantly can eliminate costly VMWRITEs to controls when
preparing vmcs02.

Shadowing exec controls also saves a VMREAD when opening virtual
INTR/NMI windows, yay...
