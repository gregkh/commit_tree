scsi: megaraid_sas: Release Mutex lock before OCR in case of DCMD timeout

Issue: There is possibility of few DCMDs timing out with 'reset_mutex' lock
held. As part of DCMD timeout handling, driver calls function
megasas_reset_fusion which also tries to acquire same lock 'reset_mutex'
and end up with deadlock.

Fix: Upon timeout of DCMDs (which are fired with 'reset_mutex' lock held),
driver will release 'reset_mutex' before calling OCR function and will
acquire lock again after OCR function returns.
