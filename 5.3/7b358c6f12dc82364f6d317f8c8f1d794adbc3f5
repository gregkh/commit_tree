mm/migrate.c: initialize pud_entry in migrate_vma()

When CONFIG_MIGRATE_VMA_HELPER is enabled, migrate_vma() calls
migrate_vma_collect() which initializes a struct mm_walk but didn't
initialize mm_walk.pud_entry.  (Found by code inspection) Use a C
structure initialization to make sure it is set to NULL.
