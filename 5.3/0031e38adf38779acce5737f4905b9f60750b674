tools/memory-model: Add data-race detection

This patch adds data-race detection to the Linux-Kernel Memory Model.
As part of this effort, support is added for:

	compiler barriers (the barrier() function), and

	a new Preserved Program Order term: (addr ; [Plain] ; wmb)

Data races are marked with a special Flag warning in herd.  It is
not guaranteed that the model will provide accurate predictions when a
data race is present.

The patch does not include documentation for the data-race detection
facility.  The basic design has been explained in various emails, and
a separate documentation patch will be submitted later.

This work is based on an earlier formulation of data races for the
LKMM by Andrea Parri.
