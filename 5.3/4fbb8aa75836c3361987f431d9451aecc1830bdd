usb: pci-quirks: Minor cleanup for AMD PLL quirk

usb_amd_find_chipset_info() is used for chipset detection for
several quirks. It is strange that its return value indicates
the need for the PLL quirk, which means it is often ignored.
This patch adds a function specifically for checking the PLL
quirk like the other ones. Additionally, rename probe_result to
something more appropriate.
