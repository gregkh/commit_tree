drm/i915/execlists: Flush the tasklet on parking

Tidy up the cleanup sequence by always ensure that the tasklet is
flushed on parking (before we cleanup). The parking provides a
convenient point to ensure that the backend is truly idle.

v2: Do the full check for idleness before parking, to be sure we flush
any residual interrupt.
