arm64: add PTRACE_SYSEMU{,SINGLESTEP} definations to uapi headers

x86 and um use 31 and 32 for PTRACE_SYSEMU and PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP
while powerpc uses different value maybe for legacy reasons.

Though handling of PTRACE_SYSEMU can be made architecture independent,
it's hard to make these definations generic. To add to this existing
mess few architectures like arm, c6x and sh use 31 for PTRACE_GETFDPIC
(get the ELF fdpic loadmap address). It's not possible to move the
definations to generic headers.

So we unfortunately have to duplicate the same defination to ARM64 if
we need to support PTRACE_SYSEMU and PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP.
