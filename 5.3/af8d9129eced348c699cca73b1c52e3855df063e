clocksource/drivers/tegra: Unify timer code

Tegra132 is 64bit platform and it has the tegra20-timer hardware unit.
Right now the corresponding timer code isn't compiled for ARM64, remove
ifdef'iness from the code and compile tegra20-timer for both 32 and 64 bit
platforms. Also note that like the older generations, Tegra210 has the
microseconds counter, hence the timer_us clocksource is now made available
for Tegra210 as well.
