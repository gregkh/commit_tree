media: media/doc: Allow sizeimage to be set by v4l clients

This changes v4l2_pix_format and v4l2_plane_pix_format sizeimage
field description to allow v4l clients to set bigger image size
in case of variable length compressed data.

Presently s5p-mfc and mtk-vcodec codec drivers use that. Lets
make it obvious in the documentation.
