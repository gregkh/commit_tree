mm/ioremap: check virtual address alignment while creating huge mappings

Virtual address alignment is essential in ensuring correct clearing for
all intermediate level pgtable entries and freeing associated pgtable
pages.  An unaligned address can end up randomly freeing pgtable page
that potentially still contains valid mappings.  Hence also check it's
alignment along with existing phys_addr check.
