crypto: arc4 - refactor arc4 core code into separate library

Refactor the core rc4 handling so we can move most users to a library
interface, permitting us to drop the cipher interface entirely in a
future patch. This is part of an effort to simplify the crypto API
and improve its robustness against incorrect use.
