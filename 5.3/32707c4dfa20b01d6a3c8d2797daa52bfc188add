inet: frags: Remove unnecessary smp_store_release/READ_ONCE

The smp_store_release call in fqdir_exit cannot protect the setting
of fqdir->dead as claimed because its memory barrier is only
guaranteed to be one-way and the barrier precedes the setting of
fqdir->dead.

IOW it doesn't provide any barriers between fq->dir and the following
hash table destruction.

In fact, the code is safe anyway because call_rcu does provide both
the memory barrier as well as a guarantee that when the destruction
work starts executing all RCU readers will see the updated value for
fqdir->dead.

Therefore this patch removes the unnecessary smp_store_release call
as well as the corresponding READ_ONCE on the read-side in order to
not confuse future readers of this code.  Comments have been added
in their places.
