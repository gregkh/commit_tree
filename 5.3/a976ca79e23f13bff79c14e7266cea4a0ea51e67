net: stmmac: Prevent missing interrupts when running NAPI

When we trigger NAPI we are disabling interrupts but in case we receive
or send a packet in the meantime, as interrupts are disabled, we will
miss this event.

Trigger both NAPI instances (RX and TX) when at least one event happens
so that we don't miss any interrupts.
