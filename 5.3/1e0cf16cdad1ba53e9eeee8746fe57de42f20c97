KVM: arm/arm64: Initialise host's MPIDRs by reading the actual register

As part of setting up the host context, we populate its
MPIDR by using cpu_logical_map(). It turns out that contrary
to arm64, cpu_logical_map() on 32bit ARM doesn't return the
*full* MPIDR, but a truncated version.

This leaves the host MPIDR slightly corrupted after the first
run of a VM, since we won't correctly restore the MPIDR on
exit. Oops.

Since we cannot trust cpu_logical_map(), let's adopt a different
strategy. We move the initialization of the host CPU context as
part of the per-CPU initialization (which, in retrospect, makes
a lot of sense), and directly read the MPIDR from the HW. This
is guaranteed to work on both arm and arm64.
