drm/i915: Flush the switch-to-kernel-context harder for DROP_IDLE

To complete the idle worker, we must complete 2 passes of wait-for-idle.
At the end of the first pass, we queue a switch-to-kernel-context and
may only idle after waiting for its completion. Speed up the flush_work
by doing the wait explicitly, which then allows us to remove the
unbounded loop trying to complete the flush_work in the next patch.
