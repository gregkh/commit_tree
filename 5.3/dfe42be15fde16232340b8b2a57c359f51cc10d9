netfilter: nft_flow_offload: skip tcp rst and fin packets

TCP rst and fin packets do not qualify to place a flow into the
flowtable. Most likely there will be no more packets after connection
closure. Without this patch, this flow entry expires and connection
tracking picks up the entry in ESTABLISHED state using the fixup
timeout, which makes this look inconsistent to the user for a connection
that is actually already closed.
