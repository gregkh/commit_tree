dm: enable synchronous dax

This patch sets dax device 'DAXDEV_SYNC' flag if all the target
devices of device mapper support synchrononous DAX. If device
mapper consists of both synchronous and asynchronous dax devices,
we don't set 'DAXDEV_SYNC' flag.

'dm_table_supports_dax' is refactored to pass 'iterate_devices_fn'
as argument so that the callers can pass the appropriate functions.
