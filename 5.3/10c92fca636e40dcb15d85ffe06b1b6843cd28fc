md-bitmap: create and destroy wb_info_pool with the change of backlog

Since we can enable write-behind mode by write backlog node,
so create wb_info_pool if the mode is just enabled, also call
call md_bitmap_update_sb to make user aware the write-behind
mode is enabled. Conversely, wb_info_pool should be destroyed
when write-behind mode is disabled.

Beside above, it is better to update bitmap sb if we change
the number of max_write_behind.
