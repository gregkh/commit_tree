nvme: add I/O characteristics fields

Several new fields have been introduced in version 1.4 of the NVMe spec
at offsets that were defined as reserved in version 1.3d of the NVMe
spec. Update the definition of the nvme_id_ns data structure such that
it is in sync with version 1.4 of the NVMe spec. This change preserves
backwards compatibility.
