page_pool: introduce page_pool_free and use in mlx5

In case driver fails to register the page_pool with XDP return API (via
xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model()), then the driver can free the page_pool
resources more directly than calling page_pool_destroy(), which does a
unnecessarily RCU free procedure.

This patch is preparing for removing page_pool_destroy(), from driver
invocation.
