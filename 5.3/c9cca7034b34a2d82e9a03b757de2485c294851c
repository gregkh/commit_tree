crypto: talitos - Align SEC1 accesses to 32 bits boundaries.

The MPC885 reference manual states:

SEC Lite-initiated 8xx writes can occur only on 32-bit-word boundaries, but
reads can occur on any byte boundary. Writing back a header read from a
non-32-bit-word boundary will yield unpredictable results.

In order to ensure that, cra_alignmask is set to 3 for SEC1.
