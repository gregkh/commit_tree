block: fix max segment size handling in blk_queue_virt_boundary

We should only set the max segment size to unlimited if we actually
have a virt boundary.  Otherwise we accidentally clear that limit
when called from the SCSI midlayer, which always calls
blk_queue_virt_boundary, even if that mask is 0.
