ASoC: ti: davinci-evm: consider CPU-Platform possibility

commit f46da1b9046e ("ASoC: ti: davinci-evm: don't select unnecessary
Platform")

Current ALSA SoC avoid to add duplicate component to rtd,
and this driver was selecting CPU component as Platform component.
Thus, above patch removed Platform settings from this driver,
because it assumed these are same component.

But, some CPU driver is using generic DMAEngine, in such case, both
CPU component and Platform component will have same of_node/name.
In other words, there are some components which are different but
have same of_node/name.

In such case, Card driver definitely need to select Platform even
though it is same as CPU.
It is depends on CPU driver, but is difficult to know it from Card driver.
This patch reverts above patch.
