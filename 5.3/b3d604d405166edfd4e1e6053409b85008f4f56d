i2c: iproc: Stop advertising support of SMBUS quick cmd

The driver does not support the SMBUS Quick command so remove the
flag that indicates that level of support.
By default the i2c_detect tool uses the quick command to try and
detect devices at some bus addresses.  If the quick command is used
then we will not detect the device, even though it is present.
