mount_pseudo(): drop 'name' argument, switch to d_make_root()

Once upon a time we used to set ->d_name of e.g. pipefs root
so that d_path() on pipes would work.  These days it's
completely pointless - dentries of pipes are not even connected
to pipefs root.  However, mount_pseudo() had set the root
dentry name (passed as the second argument) and callers
kept inventing names to pass to it.  Including those that
didn't *have* any non-root dentries to start with...

All of that had been pointless for about 8 years now; it's
time to get rid of that cargo-culting...
