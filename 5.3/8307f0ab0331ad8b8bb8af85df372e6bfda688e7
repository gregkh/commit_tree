media: vicodec: use correct sizeimage value when draining

After a resolution change is detected, q_data->sizeimage is updated
to the new format, but buf_prepare is still draining buffers that
need to use the old pre-resolution-change value. So store the sizeimage
value in q_data->vb2_sizeimage in queue_setup and use that in
buf_prepare.
