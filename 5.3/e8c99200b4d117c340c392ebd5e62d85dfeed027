libceph: don't call crypto_free_sync_skcipher() on a NULL tfm

In set_secret(), key->tfm is assigned to NULL on line 55, and then
ceph_crypto_key_destroy(key) is executed.

ceph_crypto_key_destroy(key)
  crypto_free_sync_skcipher(key->tfm)
    crypto_free_skcipher(&tfm->base);

This happens to work because crypto_sync_skcipher is a trivial wrapper
around crypto_skcipher: &tfm->base is still 0 and crypto_free_skcipher()
handles that.  Let's not rely on the layout of crypto_sync_skcipher.

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
