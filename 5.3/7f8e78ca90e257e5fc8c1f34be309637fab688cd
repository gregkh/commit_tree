arm64: dts: juno: set the right partition type for NOR flash

We do not normally access the flash on the Juno, as this
will disturb other aspects of the system, but if we choose
to do so anyways, we should set up the partitions in the
right way so we will find out what is in the flash.

The ARM Firmware Suite now has its own compatible and
proper device tree bindings to trigger discovery of the
flash contents, and Linux supports handling the new type
of AFS partitions.
