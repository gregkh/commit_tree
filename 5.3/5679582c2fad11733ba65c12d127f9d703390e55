iommu/vt-d: Allow DMA domain attaching to rmrr locked device

We don't allow a device to be assigned to user level when it is locked
by any RMRR's. Hence, intel_iommu_attach_device() will return error if
a domain of type IOMMU_DOMAIN_UNMANAGED is about to attach to a device
locked by rmrr. But this doesn't apply to a domain of type other than
IOMMU_DOMAIN_UNMANAGED. This adds a check to fix this.
