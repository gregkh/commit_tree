scsi: core: use scmd_printk() to print which command timed out

With a possibly faulty disk the following messages may appear in the logs:

kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 180s
kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 20s
kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 20s
kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 60s
kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 20s

This is not very informative because it's not possible to identify the
command that timed out.

This patch replaces sdev_printk() with scmd_printk().
