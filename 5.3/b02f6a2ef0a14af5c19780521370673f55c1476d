platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Attach using APCI HID "INT33A1"

Most modern platforms already have the ACPI device "INT33A1" that could
be used to attach to the driver. Switch the driver to using that and
thus make the intel_pmc_core.c a pure platform_driver.

Some of the legacy platforms though, may still not have this ACPI device
in their ACPI tables. Thus for such platforms, move the code to manually
instantiate a platform_device into a new file of its own. This would
instantiate the intel_pmc_core platform device and thus attach to
the driver, if the ACPI device for the same ("INT33A1") is not present
in a system where it should be. This was discussed here:
