mlxsw: spectrum: PTP: Garbage-collect unmatched entries

On Spectrum-1, timestamped PTP packets and the corresponding timestamps
need to be kept in caches until both are available, at which point they are
matched up and packets forwarded as appropriate. However, not all packets
will ever see their timestamp, and not all timestamps will ever see their
packet. It is therefore necessary to dispose of such abandoned entries.

To that end, introduce a garbage collector to collect entries that have
not had their counterpart turn up within about a second. The GC
maintains a monotonously-increasing value of GC cycle. Every entry that
is put to the hash table is annotated with the GC cycle at which it
should be collected. When the GC runs, it walks the hash table, and
collects the objects according to their GC cycle annotation.
