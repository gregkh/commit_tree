KVM: nVMX: include conditional controls in /dev/kvm KVM_GET_MSRS

Some secondary controls are automatically enabled/disabled based on the CPUID
values that are set for the guest.  However, they are still available at a
global level and therefore should be present when KVM_GET_MSRS is sent to
/dev/kvm.
