regulator: twl: voltage lists for vdd1/2 on twl4030

_opp_supported_by_regulators() wrongly ignored errors from
regulator_is_supported_voltage(), so it considered errors as
success. Since
commit 498209445124 ("regulator: core: simplify return value on suported_voltage")
regulator_is_supported_voltage() returns a real boolean, so
errors make _opp_supported_by_regulators() return false.

That reveals a problem with the declaration of the VDD1/2
regulators on twl4030.
The VDD1/VDD2 regulators on twl4030 are neither defined with
voltage lists nor with the continuous flag set, so
regulator_is_supported_voltage() returns false and an error
before above mentioned commit (which was considered success)
The result is that after the above mentioned commit cpufreq
does not work properly e.g. dm3730.

The patch fixes declaration of VDD1/2 regulators by
adding proper voltage lists.
