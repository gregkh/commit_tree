media: vicodec: pass on enc output format to capture side

Setting the encoder output format to e.g. 1920x1080 will set the
crop rectangle to 1920x1088, the coded resolution to 1920x1088 and
the capture coded resolution and sizeimage to 1920x1088 as well.

Note that this might change, since the encoder spec is still in
flux with respect to how this should behave.
