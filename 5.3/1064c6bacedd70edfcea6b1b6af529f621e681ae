pwm: meson: Move pwm_set_chip_data() to meson_pwm_request()

All existing PWM drivers (except pwm-meson and two other ones) call
pwm_set_chip_data() from their pwm_ops.request() callback. Now that we
can access the struct meson_pwm_channel from struct meson_pwm we can do
the same.

Move the call to pwm_set_chip_data() to meson_pwm_request() and drop the
custom meson_pwm_add_channels(). This makes the implementation
consistent with other drivers and makes it slightly more obvious
thatpwm_get_chip_data() cannot be used from pwm_ops.get_state() (because
that's called by the PWM core before pwm_ops.request()).

No functional changes intended.
