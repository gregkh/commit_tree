ipv6/route: Change return code of rt6_dump_route() for partial node dumps

In the next patch, we are going to add optional dump of exceptions to
rt6_dump_route().

Change the return code of rt6_dump_route() to accomodate partial node
dumps: we might dump multiple routes per node, and might be able to dump
only a given number of them, so fib6_dump_node() will need to know how
many routes have been dumped on partial dump, to restart the dump from the
point where it was interrupted.

Note that fib6_dump_node() is the only caller and already handles all
non-negative return codes as success: those become -1 to signal that we're
done with the node. If we fail, return 0, as we were unable to dump the
single route in the node, but we're not done with it.
