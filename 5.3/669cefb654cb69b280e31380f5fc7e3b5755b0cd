RDMA/hns: Remove jiffies operation in disable interrupt context

In some functions, the jiffies operation is unnecessary, and we can
control delay using mdelay and udelay functions only.  Especially, in
hns_roce_v1_clear_hem, the function calls spin_lock_irqsave, the context
disables interrupt, so we can not use jiffies and msleep functions.
