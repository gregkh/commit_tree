arm64: ptrace: add support for syscall emulation

Add PTRACE_SYSEMU and PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP support on arm64.
We don't need any special handling for PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP.

It's quite difficult to generalize handling PTRACE_SYSEMU cross
architectures and avoid calls to tracehook_report_syscall_entry twice.
Different architecture have different mechanism to indicate NO_SYSCALL
and trying to generalise adds more code for no gain.
