arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Add PSCI cpuidle low power states

Add device bindings for cpuidle states for cpu devices.

msm8996 features 4 cpus - 2 in each cluster. However, all cpus implement
the same microarchitecture and the two clusters only differ in the
maximum frequency attainable by the CPUs.
