habanalabs: fix device IRQ unmasking for BE host

When unmasking IRQs inside the ASIC, the driver passes an array of all the

host, the driver needs to do the proper endianness swapping when preparing
this array.

In addition, this patch also fixes the endianness of a couple of kernel log
debug messages that print values of packets
