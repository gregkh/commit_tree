drm: revocation check at drm subsystem

On every hdcp revocation check request SRM is read from fw file
/lib/firmware/display_hdcp_srm.bin

SRM table is parsed and stored at drm_hdcp.c, with functions exported
for the services for revocation check from drivers (which
implements the HDCP authentication)

This patch handles the HDCP1.4 and 2.2 versions of SRM table.

v4:
  s/__swab16/be16_to_cpu [Daniel]
  be24_to_cpu is done through a global func [Daniel]
  Unused variables are removed. [Daniel]
  unchecked return values are dropped from static funcs [Daniel]
