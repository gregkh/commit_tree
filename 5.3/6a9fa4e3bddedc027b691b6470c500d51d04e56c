perf string: Move 'dots' and 'graph_dotted_line' out of sane_ctype.h

Those are not in that file in the git repo, lets move it from there so
that we get that sane ctype code fully isolated to allow getting it in
sync either with the git sources or better with the kernel sources
(include/linux/ctype.h + lib/ctype.h), that way we can use
check_headers.h to get notified when changes are made in the original
code so that we can cherry-pick.
