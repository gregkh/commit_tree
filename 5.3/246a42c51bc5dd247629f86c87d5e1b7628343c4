NTB: Introduce helper functions to calculate logical port number

This patch introduces the "Logical Port Number" which is similar to the
"Port Number" in that it enumerates the ports in the system.

The original (or Physical) "Port Number" can be any number used by the
hardware to uniquely identify a port in the system. The "Logical Port
Number" enumerates all ports in the system from 0 to the number of
ports minus one.

For example a system with 5 ports might have the following port numbers
which would be enumerated thusly:

Port Number:           1  2  5  7  116
Logical Port Number:   0  1  2  3  4

The logical port number is useful when calculating which resources
to use for which peers. So we thus define two helper functions:
ntb_logical_port_number() and ntb_peer_logical_port_number() which
provide the "Logical Port Number" for the local port and any peer
respectively.
