drm/i915: Keep rings pinned while the context is active

Remember to keep the rings pinned as well as the context image until the
GPU is no longer active.

v2: Introduce a ring->pin_count primarily to hide the
mock_ring that doesn't fit into the normal GGTT vma picture.

v3: Order is important in teardown, ringbuffer submission needs to drop
the pin count on the engine->kernel_context before it can gleefully free
its ring.
