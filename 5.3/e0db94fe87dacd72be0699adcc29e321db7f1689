bus: ti-sysc: Make OCP reset work for sysstatus and sysconfig reset bits

We've had minimal OCP softreset support in ti-sysc interconnect target
module driver only used for MCAN driver so far. But it turns out that
MCAN has the sysstatus register resetdone bit inverted compared to most
other modules.

Let's make OCP softreset work for other typical cases with reset status
in sysstatus or sysconfig register so we can use the new functions for
sysc_enable_module() and sysc_disable_module() without "ti,hwmods"
property in the following patches.
