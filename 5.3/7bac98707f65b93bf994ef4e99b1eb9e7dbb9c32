kbuild: add OBJSIZE variable for the size tool

Define and export OBJSIZE variable for "size" tool from binutils to be
used in architecture specific Makefiles (naming the variable just "SIZE"
would be too risky). In particular this tool is useful to perform checks
that early boot code is not using bss section (which might have not been
zeroed yet or intersects with initrd or other files boot loader might
have put right after the linux kernel).
