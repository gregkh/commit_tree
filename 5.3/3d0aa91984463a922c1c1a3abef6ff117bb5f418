wil6210: remove HALP for Talyn devices

In Talyn the HW is responsible for power management enter / exit
flow, hence the deep sleep exit latency is significantly shorter than
in Sparrow.
In such a case HALP feature, that is meant to prevent long PCIe blocking
accesses, is no longer needed and can be removed for Talyn.
