VMCI: Fix integer overflow in VMCI handle arrays

The VMCI handle array has an integer overflow in
vmci_handle_arr_append_entry when it tries to expand the array. This can be
triggered from a guest, since the doorbell link hypercall doesn't impose a
limit on the number of doorbell handles that a VM can create in the
hypervisor, and these handles are stored in a handle array.

In this change, we introduce a mandatory max capacity for handle
arrays/lists to avoid excessive memory usage.
