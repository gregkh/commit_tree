usb: host: xhci-tegra: Fix Wunused-const-variable

Clang produces the following warning

drivers/usb/host/xhci-tegra.c:357:27: warning: unused variable
'mbox_cmd_name' [-Wunused-const-variable]
static const char * const mbox_cmd_name[] = {

Looks like it was intended for logging or debugging, but was
never implemented. Removing mbox_cmd_name.
