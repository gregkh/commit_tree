ath6kl: wmi: use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace code of the following form:

sizeof(*ev) + ev->num_neighbors * sizeof(struct wmi_neighbor_info)

with:

struct_size(ev, neighbor, ev->num_neighbors)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
