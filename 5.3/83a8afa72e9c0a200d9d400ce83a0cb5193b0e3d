vmw_balloon: Compaction support

Add support for compaction for VMware balloon. Since unlike the virtio
balloon, we also support huge-pages, which are not going through
compaction, we keep these pages in vmballoon and handle this list
separately. We use the same lock to protect both lists, as this lock is
not supposed to be contended.

Doing so also eliminates the need for the page_size lists. We update the
accounting as needed to reflect inflation, deflation and migration to be
reflected in vmstat.

Since VMware balloon now provides statistics for inflation, deflation
and migration in vmstat, select MEMORY_BALLOON in Kconfig.
