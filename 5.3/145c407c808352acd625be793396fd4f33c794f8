perf stat: Make metric event lookup more robust

After setting up metric groups through the event parser, the metricgroup
code looks them up again in the event list.

Make sure we only look up events that haven't been used by some other
metric. The data structures currently cannot handle more than one metric
per event. This avoids problems with multiple events partially
overlapping.
