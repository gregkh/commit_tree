tty: max310x: Introduce max310x_one port macro-wrapper

uart_port structure instance is embedded into the max310x_one
super-structure, which is accessed by some of the uart-port callback
methods. In order to improve the callback's code readability lets
define the to_max310x_port() wrapper which just translates the passed
uart_port pointer to the max310x_one one. It is also going to be
handy in future commits.
