r8169: silence sparse warning in rtl8169_start_xmit

The opts[] array is of type u32. Therefore remove the wrong
cpu_to_le32(). The opts[] array members are converted to little endian
later when being assigned to the respective descriptor fields.

This is not a new issue, it just popped up due to r8169.c having
been renamed and more thoroughly checked. Due to the renaming
this patch applies to net-next only.
