fscrypt: remove selection of CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256

fscrypt only uses SHA-256 for AES-128-CBC-ESSIV, which isn't the default
and is only recommended on platforms that have hardware accelerated
AES-CBC but not AES-XTS.  There's no link-time dependency, since SHA-256
is requested via the crypto API on first use.

To reduce bloat, we should limit FS_ENCRYPTION to selecting the default
algorithms only.  SHA-256 by itself isn't that much bloat, but it's
being discussed to move ESSIV into a crypto API template, which would
incidentally bring in other things like "authenc" support, which would
all end up being built-in since FS_ENCRYPTION is now a bool.

For Adiantum encryption we already just document that users who want to
use it have to enable CONFIG_CRYPTO_ADIANTUM themselves.  So, let's do
the same for AES-128-CBC-ESSIV and CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256.
