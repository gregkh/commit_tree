i3c: fix i2c and i3c scl rate by bus mode

Currently the I3C framework limits SCL frequency to FM speed when
dealing with a mixed slow bus, even if all I2C devices are FM+ capable.

The core was also not accounting for I3C speed limitations when
operating in mixed slow mode and was erroneously using FM+ speed as the
max I2C speed when operating in mixed fast mode.
