Revert "Merge branch 'vmwgfx-next' of git://people.freedesktop.org/~thomash/linux into drm-next"

This reverts commit 031e610a6a21448a63dff7a0416e5e206724caac, reversing
changes made to 52d2d44eee8091e740d0d275df1311fb8373c9a9.

The mm changes in there we premature and not fully ack or reviewed by core mm folks,
I dropped the ball by merging them via this tree, so lets take em all back out.
