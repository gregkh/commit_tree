staging: kpc2000: added separate show functions for readable kp device attributes, defined them as read-only, and declared them static.

Defined separate simple show functions for each attribute instead of
having a one big one containing a chain of conditionals.

Replaced calls to scnprintf with sprintf since all the outputs are
single integers.

All the readable device attributes are read-only, so used DEVICE_ATTR_RO
to define them.

The definitions are only used to populate the kp_attr_list attribute
array, so declared them as static.

Fixes the following sparse warnings:
