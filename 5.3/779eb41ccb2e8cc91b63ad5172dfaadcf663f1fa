ARM: 8862/1: errata: 814220-B-Cache maintenance by set/way operations can execute out of order

The v7 ARM states that all cache and branch predictor maintenance operations
that do not specify an address execute, relative to each other, in program
order. However, because of this erratum, an L2 set/way cache maintenance
operation can overtake an L1 set/way cache maintenance operation, this would
cause the data corruption.

This ERRATA affected the Cortex-A7 and present in r0p2, r0p3, r0p4, r0p5.

This patch is the SW workaround by adding a DSB before changing cache levels as
the ARM ERRATA: ARM/MP: 814220 told in the ARM ERRATA documentation.
