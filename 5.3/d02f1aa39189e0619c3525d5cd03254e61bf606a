x86/sysfb_efi: Add quirks for some devices with swapped width and height

Some Lenovo 2-in-1s with a detachable keyboard have a portrait screen but
advertise a landscape resolution and pitch, resulting in a messed up
display if the kernel tries to show anything on the efifb (because of the
wrong pitch).

Fix this by adding a new DMI match table for devices which need to have
their width and height swapped.

At first it was tried to use the existing table for overriding some of the
efifb parameters, but some of the affected devices have variants with
different LCD resolutions which will not work with hardcoded override
values.
