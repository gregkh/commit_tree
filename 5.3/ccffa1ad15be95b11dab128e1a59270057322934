csky: Add count-width property for csky pmu

The csky pmu counter may have different io width. When the counter is
smaller then 64 bits and counter value is smaller than the old value, it
will result to a extremely large delta value. So the sampled value should
be extend to 64 bits to avoid this, the extension bits base on the
count-width property from dts.
