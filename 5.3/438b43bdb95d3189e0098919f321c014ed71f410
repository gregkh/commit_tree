gve: Fix case where desc_cnt and data_cnt can get out of sync

desc_cnt and data_cnt should always be equal. In the case of a dropped
packet desc_cnt was still getting updated (correctly), data_cnt
was not. To eliminate this bug and prevent it from recurring this
patch combines them into one ring level cnt.
