net: macb: Fix SUBNS increment and increase resolution

The subns increment register has 24 bits as follows:
RegBit[15:0] = Subns[23:8]; RegBit[31:24] = Subns[7:0]

Fix the same in the driver and increase sub ns resolution to the
best capable, 24 bits. This should be the case on all GEM versions
that this PTP driver supports.
