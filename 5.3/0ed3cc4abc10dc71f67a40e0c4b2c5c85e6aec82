samples: bpf: don't run probes at the local make stage

Quentin reports that commit 07c3bbdb1a9b ("samples: bpf: print
a warning about headers_install") is producing the false
positive when make is invoked locally, from the samples/bpf/
directory.

When make is run locally it hits the "all" target, which
will recursively invoke make through the full build system.

Speed up the "local" run which doesn't actually build anything,
and avoid false positives by skipping all the probes if not in
kbuild environment (cover both the new warning and the BTF
probes).
