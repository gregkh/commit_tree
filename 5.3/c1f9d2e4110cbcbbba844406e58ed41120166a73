usb: host: Stops USB controller init if PLL fails to lock

USB erratum-A006918 workaround tries to start internal PHY inside
uboot (when PLL fails to lock). However, if the workaround also
fails, then USB initialization is also stopped inside Linux.
Erratum-A006918 workaround failure creates "fsl,erratum_a006918"
node in device-tree. Presence of this node in device-tree is
used to stop USB controller initialization in Linux
