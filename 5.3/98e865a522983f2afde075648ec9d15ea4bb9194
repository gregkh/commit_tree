platform/x86: asus-wmi: Increase input buffer size of WMI methods

The asus-nb-wmi driver is matched by WMI alias but fails to load on TUF
Gaming series laptops producing multiple ACPI errors in the kernel log.

The input buffer for WMI method invocation size is 2 dwords, whereas
3 are expected by this model.

FX505GM:
..
Method (WMNB, 3, Serialized)
{
    P8XH (Zero, 0x11)
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, Zero, IIA0)
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x04, IIA1)
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x08, IIA2)
    Local0 = (Arg1 & 0xFFFFFFFF)
    ...

Compare with older K54C:
...
Method (WMNB, 3, NotSerialized)
{
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x00, IIA0)
    CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x04, IIA1)
    Local0 = (Arg1 & 0xFFFFFFFF)
    ...

Increase buffer size to 3 dwords. No negative consequences of this change
are expected, as the input buffer size is not verified. The original
function is replaced by a wrapper for a new method passing value 0 for the
last parameter. The new function will be used to control RGB keyboard
backlight.
