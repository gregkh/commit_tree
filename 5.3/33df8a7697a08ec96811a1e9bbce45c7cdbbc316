drm/i915: Prevent lock-cycles between GPU waits and GPU resets

We cannot allow ourselves to wait on the GPU while holding any lock as we
may need to reset the GPU. While there is not an explicit lock between
the two operations, lockdep cannot detect the dependency. So let's tell
lockdep about the wait/reset dependency with an explicit lockmap.
