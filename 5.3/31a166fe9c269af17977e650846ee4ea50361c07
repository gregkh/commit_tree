platform/x86: ISST: Add Intel Speed Select mailbox interface via PCI

Add an IOCTL to send mailbox commands to PUNIT using PUNIT PCI device.
A limited set of mailbox commands can be sent to PUNIT.

This MMIO interface is used by the intel-speed-select tool under
tools/x86/power to enumerate and control Intel Speed Select features.
The MBOX commands ids and semantics of the message can be checked from
the source code of the tool.
