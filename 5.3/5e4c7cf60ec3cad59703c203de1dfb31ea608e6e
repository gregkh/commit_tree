block: sed-opal: PSID reverttper capability

PSID is a 32 character password printed on the drive label,
to prove its physical access. This PSID reverttper function
is very useful to regain the control over the drive when it
is locked and the user can no longer access it because of some
failures. However, *all the data on the drive is completely
erased*. This method is advisable only when the user is exhausted
of all other recovery methods.

PSID capabilities are described in:
