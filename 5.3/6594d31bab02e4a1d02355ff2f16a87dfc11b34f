scsi: lpfc: Cancel queued work for an IO when processing a received ABTS

When queued work is executed posting a new command to the transport
the driver is reporting a null buffer.

The driver had received an ABTS which matched a command that had
been scheduled for delivery to the transport. The driver proceeded
to cancel the command, but the work item was never cancelled.

Fix by cancelling the queued work item. Also turns out the ABTS
response was not properly sending a BA_ACC, so set the flag to
send the ACC.
