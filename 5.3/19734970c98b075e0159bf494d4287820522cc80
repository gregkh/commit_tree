habanalabs: force user to set device debug mode

This patch adds the implementation of the HL_DEBUG_OP_SET_MODE opcode in
the DEBUG IOCTL.

It forces the user who wants to debug the device to set the device into
debug mode before he can configure the debug engines. The patch also makes
sure to disable debug mode upon user releasing FD, in case the user forgot
to disable debug mode.
