serial: stm32: add support of TX FIFO threshold

Adds the support of TX FIFO threshold in order to improve the TX FIFO
management:
- TX FIFO threshold irq enabling (instead of relying on tx empty / fifo
  not full irq that generates one irq/char)
- TXCFG is set to half fifo size (e.g. 16/2 = 8 data for a 16 data depth
  FIFO)
- irq rate may be reduced by up to 1/TXCFG,  e.g. 1 over 8 with current
  TXCFG setting.
