bus: ti-sysc: Add support for module specific reset quirks

Some older interconnect target modules need module internal clock
toggling quirks to reset properly. We've been doing this in the
platform code earlier, but need to be able to it directly in the
ti-sysc driver when we no longer rely on on the platform code.

Let's add reset handling for 1-wire, i2c and watchdog. Later on
we can add more modules like msdi and dss as they get tested.
For dra7 pcie, we should be able to just use the rstctrl reset
driver when available.
