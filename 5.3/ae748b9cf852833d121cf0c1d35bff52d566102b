wusb: switch to cbcmac transform

The wusb code takes a very peculiar approach at implementing CBC-MAC,
by using plain CBC into a scratch buffer, and taking the output IV
as the MAC.

We can clean up this code substantially by switching to the cbcmac
shash, as exposed by the CCM template. To ensure that the module is
loaded on demand, add the cbcmac template name as a module alias.
