x86/kexec: Make variable static and config dependent

The following sparse warning is emitted:

  arch/x86/kernel/crash.c:59:15:
  warning: symbol 'crash_zero_bytes' was not declared. Should it be static?

The variable is only used in this compilation unit, but it is also only
used when CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE is enabled. Just making it static would result
in a 'defined but not used' warning for CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE=n.

Make it static and move it into the existing CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE section.

[ tglx: Massaged changelog and moved it into the existing ifdef ]

Fixes: dd5f726076cc ("kexec: support for kexec on panic using new system call")
