rcu: Allow rcu_read_unlock_special() to raise_softirq() if in_irq()

When running in an interrupt handler, raise_softirq() and
raise_softirq_irqoff() have extremely low overhead: They simply set a
bit in a per-CPU mask, which is checked upon exit from that interrupt
handler.  Therefore, if rcu_read_unlock_special() is invoked within an
interrupt handler and RCU_SOFTIRQ is in use, this commit make use of
raise_softirq_irqoff() even if there is no expedited grace period in
flight and even if this is not a nohz_full CPU.
