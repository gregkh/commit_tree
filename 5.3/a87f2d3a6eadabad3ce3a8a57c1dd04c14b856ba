KVM: x86: Add Intel CPUID.1F cpuid emulation support

Add support to expose Intel V2 Extended Topology Enumeration Leaf for
some new systems with multiple software-visible die within each package.

Because unimplemented and unexposed leaves should be explicitly reported
as zero, there is no need to limit cpuid.0.eax to the maximum value of
feature configuration but limit it to the highest leaf implemented in
the current code. A single clamping seems sufficient and cheaper.
