rcutorture: Fix stutter_wait() return value and freelist checks

The stutter_wait() function is supposed to return true if it actually
waits and false otherwise, but it instead unconditionally returns false.
Which hides a bug in rcu_torture_writer() that fails to account for
the fact that one of the rcu_tortures[] array elements will normally be
referenced by rcu_torture_current, and thus not be on the freelist.

This commit therefore corrects the stutter_wait() return value and adds a
check for rcu_torture_current to rcu_torture_writer()'s check that things
get freed after everything goes quiescent.  In addition, this commit
causes torture_stutter() to give a bit more than one second (instead of
only one jiffy) warning of the end of the stutter interval.  Finally,
this commit disables long-delay readers and aggressive update-side
forward-progress checks while forward-progress testing is in flight.
