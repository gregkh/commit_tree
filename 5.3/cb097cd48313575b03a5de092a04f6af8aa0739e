slub: don't panic for memcg kmem cache creation failure

Currently for CONFIG_SLUB, if a memcg kmem cache creation is failed and
the corresponding root kmem cache has SLAB_PANIC flag, the kernel will
be crashed.  This is unnecessary as the kernel can handle the creation
failures of memcg kmem caches.  Additionally CONFIG_SLAB does not
implement this behavior.  So, to keep the behavior consistent between
SLAB and SLUB, removing the panic for memcg kmem cache creation
failures.  The root kmem cache creation failure for SLAB_PANIC correctly
panics for both SLAB and SLUB.
