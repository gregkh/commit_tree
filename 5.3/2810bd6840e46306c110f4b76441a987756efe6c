xfs: convert bulkstat to new iwalk infrastructure

Create a new ibulk structure incore to help us deal with bulk inode stat
state tracking and then convert the bulkstat code to use the new iwalk
iterator.  This disentangles inode walking from bulk stat control for
simpler code and enables us to isolate the formatter functions to the
ioctl handling code.
