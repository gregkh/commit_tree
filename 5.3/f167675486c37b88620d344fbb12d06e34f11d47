clk: sunxi-ng: sun50i-h6-r: Fix incorrect W1 clock gate register

The current code defines W1 clock gate to be at 0x1cc, overlaying it
with the IR gate.

Clock gate for r-apb1-w1 is at 0x1ec. This fixes issues with IR receiver
causing interrupt floods on H6 (because interrupt flags can't be cleared,
due to IR module's bus being disabled).
