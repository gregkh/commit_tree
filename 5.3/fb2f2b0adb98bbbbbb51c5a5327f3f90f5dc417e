mm: memcg/slab: reparent memcg kmem_caches on cgroup removal

Let's reparent non-root kmem_caches on memcg offlining.  This allows us to
release the memory cgroup without waiting for the last outstanding kernel
object (e.g.  dentry used by another application).

Since the parent cgroup is already charged, everything we need to do is to
splice the list of kmem_caches to the parent's kmem_caches list, swap the
memcg pointer, drop the css refcounter for each kmem_cache and adjust the
parent's css refcounter.

Please, note that kmem_cache->memcg_params.memcg isn't a stable pointer
anymore.  It's safe to read it under rcu_read_lock(), cgroup_mutex held,
or any other way that protects the memory cgroup from being released.

We can race with the slab allocation and deallocation paths.  It's not a
big problem: parent's charge and slab global stats are always correct, and
we don't care anymore about the child usage and global stats.  The child
cgroup is already offline, so we don't use or show it anywhere.

Local slab stats (NR_SLAB_RECLAIMABLE and NR_SLAB_UNRECLAIMABLE) aren't
used anywhere except count_shadow_nodes().  But even there it won't break
anything: after reparenting "nodes" will be 0 on child level (because
we're already reparenting shrinker lists), and on parent level page stats
always were 0, and this patch won't change anything.
