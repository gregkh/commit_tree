ASoC: amd: acp3x: use dma_ops of parent device for acp3x dma driver

AMD platform device acp3x_rv_i2s created by parent PCI device
driver. Pass struct device of the parent to
snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages() so dma_alloc_coherent() can use
correct dma_ops. Otherwise, it will use default dma_ops which
is nommu_dma_ops on x86_64 even when IOMMU is enabled and
set to non passthrough mode.
