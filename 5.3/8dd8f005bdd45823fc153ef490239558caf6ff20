iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Invalidate ATC when detaching a device

We make the invalid assumption in arm_smmu_detach_dev() that the ATC is
clear after calling pci_disable_ats(). For one thing, only enabling the
PCIe ATS capability constitutes an implicit invalidation event, so the
comment was wrong. More importantly, the ATS capability isn't necessarily
disabled by pci_disable_ats() in a PF, if the associated VFs have ATS
enabled. Explicitly invalidate all ATC entries in arm_smmu_detach_dev().
The endpoint cannot form new ATC entries because STE.EATS is clear.
