bnx2x: Disable multi-cos feature.

Commit 3968d38917eb ("bnx2x: Fix Multi-Cos.") which enabled multi-cos
feature after prolonged time in driver added some regression causing
numerous issues (sudden reboots, tx timeout etc.) reported by customers.
We plan to backout this commit and submit proper fix once we have root
cause of issues reported with this feature enabled.
