vt: More locking checks

I honestly have no idea what the subtle differences between
con_is_visible, con_is_fg (internal to vt.c) and con_is_bound are. But
it looks like both vc->vc_display_fg and con_driver_map are protected
by the console_lock, so probably better if we hold that when checking
this.

To do that I had to deinline the con_is_visible function.
