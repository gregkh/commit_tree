bpf: sockmap, only create entry if ulp is not already enabled

Sockmap does not currently support adding sockets after TLS has been
enabled. There never was a real use case for this so it was never
added. But, we lost the test for ULP at some point so add it here
and fail the socket insert if TLS is enabled. Future work could
make sockmap support this use case but fixup the bug here.
