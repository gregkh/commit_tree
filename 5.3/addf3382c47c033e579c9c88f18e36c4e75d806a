Revert "HID: logitech-hidpp: add USB PID for a few more supported mice"

This partially reverts commit 27fc32fd9417968a459d43d9a7c50fd423d53eb9.

It turns out that the G502 has some issues with hid-logitech-hidpp:
when plugging it in, the driver tries to contact it but it fails.
So the driver bails out leaving only the mouse event node available.

This timeout is problematic as it introduce a delay in the boot,
and having only the mouse event node means that the hardware
macros keys can not be relayed to the userspace.

Filipe and I just gave a shot at the following devices:

G403 Wireless (0xC082)
G703 (0xC087)
G703 Hero (0xC090)
G903 (0xC086)
G903 Hero (0xC091)
G Pro (0xC088)

Reverting the devices we are not sure that works flawlessly.
