net: phy: Add more 1000BaseX support detection

Commit "net: phy: Add detection of 1000BaseX link mode support" added
support for not filtering out 1000BaseX mode from the PHY's supported
modes in genphy_config_init, but we have to make a similar change in
genphy_read_abilities in order to actually detect it as a supported mode
in the first place. Add this in.
