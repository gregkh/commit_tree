iavf: Use printf instead of gnu_printf for iavf_debug_d

Clang warns:

        __attribute__ ((format(gnu_printf, 3, 4)));
                        ^

We can convert from gnu_printf to printf without any side effects for
two reasons:

1. All iavf_debug instances use standard printf formats, as pointed out
   by Miguel Ojeda at the below link, meaning gnu_printf is not strictly
   required.

2. However, GCC has aliased printf to gnu_printf on Linux since at least
   2010 based on git history.

   From gcc/c-family/c-format.c:

   /* Attributes such as "printf" are equivalent to those such as
      "gnu_printf" unless this is overridden by a target.  */
   static const target_ovr_attr gnu_target_overrides_format_attributes[] =
   {
     { "gnu_printf",   "printf" },
     { "gnu_scanf",    "scanf" },
     { "gnu_strftime", "strftime" },
     { "gnu_strfmon",  "strfmon" },
     { NULL,           NULL }
   };

The mentioned override only happens on Windows (mingw32). Changing from
gnu_printf to printf is a no-op for GCC and stops Clang from warning.
