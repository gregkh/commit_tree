arm64: dts: qcom: pms405: Rename adc outputs as per schematics

The adc outputs shouldn't contain information about their configuration
e.g. 100K pull-up, but just reflect the name of the signal in the
schematics.

Making them labels also allows us to overwrite their configuration in
board-specific DTs.

Sort them by order as used in adc5_chans_rev2, while we're at it.
