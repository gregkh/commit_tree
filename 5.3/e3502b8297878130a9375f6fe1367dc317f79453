net: dsa: sja1105: Make vid 1 the default pvid

In SJA1105 there is no concept of 'default values' per se, everything
needs to be driver-supplied through the static configuration tables.

The issue is that the hardware manual says that 'at least the default
untagging VLAN' is mandatory to be provided through the static config.
But VLAN 0 isn't a very good initial pvid - its use is reserved for
priority-tagged frames, and the layers of the stack that care about
those already make sure that this VLAN is installed, as can be seen in
the message below:

  8021q: adding VLAN 0 to HW filter on device swp2

So change the pvid provided through the static configuration to 1, which
matches the bridge core's defaults.
