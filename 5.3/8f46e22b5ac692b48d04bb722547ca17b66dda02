regulator: axp20x: fix DCDC5 and DCDC6 for AXP803

Refactoring of axp20x driver introduced a bug in AXP803's DCDC6
regulator definition. AXP803_DCDC6_1120mV_STEPS was obtained by
subtracting 0x47 and 0x33. This should be 0x14 (hex) and not 14
(dec).

Refactoring also carried over a bug in DCDC5 regulator definition.
Number of possible voltages must be for 1 bigger than maximum valid
voltage index, because 0 is also valid and it means lowest voltage.

Fixes: db4a555f7c4c ("regulator: axp20x: use defines for masks")
