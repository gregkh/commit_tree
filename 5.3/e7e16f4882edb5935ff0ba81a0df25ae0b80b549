btrfs: add common checksum type validation

Currently btrfs is only supporting CRC32C as checksumming algorithm. As
this is about to change provide a function to validate the checksum type
in the superblock against all possible algorithms.

This makes adding new algorithms easier as there are fewer places to
adjust when adding new algorithms.
