lib: logic_pio: Add logic_pio_unregister_range()

Add a function to unregister a logical PIO range.

Logical PIO space can still be leaked when unregistering certain
LOGIC_PIO_CPU_MMIO regions, but this acceptable for now since there are no
callers to unregister LOGIC_PIO_CPU_MMIO regions, and the logical PIO
region allocation scheme would need significant work to improve this.
