arm64/mm: Simplify protection flag creation for kernel huge mappings

Even though they have got the same value, PMD_TYPE_SECT and PUD_TYPE_SECT
get used for kernel huge mappings. But before that first the table bit gets
cleared using leaf level PTE_TABLE_BIT. Though functionally they are same,
we should use page table level specific macros to be consistent as per the
MMU specifications. Create page table level specific wrappers for kernel
huge mapping entries and just drop mk_sect_prot() which does not have any
other user.
