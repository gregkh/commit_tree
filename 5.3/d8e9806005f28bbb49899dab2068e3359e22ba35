HID: wacom: generic: only switch the mode on devices with LEDs

Currently, the driver will attempt to set the mode on all
devices with a center button, but some devices with a center
button lack LEDs, and attempting to set the LEDs on devices
without LEDs results in the kernel error message of the form:

"leds input8::wacom-0.1: Setting an LED's brightness failed (-32)"

This is because the generic codepath erroneously assumes that the
BUTTON_CENTER usage indicates that the device has LEDs, the
previously ignored TOUCH_RING_SETTING usage is a more accurate
indication of the existence of LEDs on the device.
