staging: kpc2000: kpc_spi: remove unnecessary ulong repr of i/o addr

The kpc_spi driver stashes off an unsigned long representation of the
i/o mapping returned by devm_ioremap_nocache(). This is unnecessary, as
the only use of the unsigned long repr is to eventually be re-cast to
an (u64 __iomem *). Instead of casting the (void __iomem *) to an
(unsigned long) then a (u64 __iomem *), just remove this intermediate
step. As this intermediary is no longer used, also remove it from its
structure.
