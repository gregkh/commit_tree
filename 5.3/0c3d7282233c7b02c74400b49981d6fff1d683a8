iwlwifi: Add support for SAR South Korea limitation

South Korea is adding a more strict SAR limit called "Limb SAR".
Currently, WGDS SAR offset group 3 is not used (not mapped to any country).
In order to be able to comply with South Korea new restriction:
- OEM will use WGDS SAR offset group 3 to South Korea limitation.
- OEM will change WGDS revision to 1 (currently latest revision is 0)
	to notify that Korea Limb SAR applied.
- Driver will read the WGDS table and pass the values to FW (as usual)
- Driver will pass to FW an indication that Korea Limb SAR is applied
	in case table revision is 1.
