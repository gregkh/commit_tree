rcu: Avoid self-IPI in sync_rcu_exp_select_node_cpus()

Although sync_rcu_exp_select_node_cpus() treats the current CPU as being
in a quiescent state, it might well migrate to some other CPU before
reaching the smp_call_function_single(), which could then result in an
unnecessary simulated self-IPI.  This commit therefore instead simply
refuses to invoke smp_call_function_single() on the current CPU, which
causes the later rcu_report_exp_cpu_mult() to report this CPU's quiescent
state with less overhead.

This also reduces the rcu_exp_handler() function's state space by removing
the direct call that this smp_call_function_single() uses to emulate the
requested self-IPI.
