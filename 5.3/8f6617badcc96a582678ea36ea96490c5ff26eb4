ixgbevf: Fix secpath usage for IPsec Tx offload

Port the same fix for ixgbe to ixgbevf.

The ixgbevf driver currently does IPsec Tx offloading
based on an existing secpath. However, the secpath
can also come from the Rx side, in this case it is
misinterpreted for Tx offload and the packets are
dropped with a "bad sa_idx" error. Fix this by using
the xfrm_offload() function to test for Tx offload.
