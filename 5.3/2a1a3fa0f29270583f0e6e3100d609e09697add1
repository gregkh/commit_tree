kallsyms: Don't let kallsyms_lookup_size_offset() fail on retrieving the first symbol

An arm64 kernel configured with

  CONFIG_KPROBES=y
  CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y
  # CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL is not set
  CONFIG_KALLSYMS_BASE_RELATIVE=y

reports the following kprobe failure:

  [    0.032677] kprobes: failed to populate blacklist: -22
  [    0.033376] Please take care of using kprobes.

It appears that kprobe fails to retrieve the symbol at address
0xffff000010081000, despite this symbol being in System.map:

  ffff000010081000 T __exception_text_start

This symbol is part of the first group of aliases in the
kallsyms_offsets array (symbol names generated using ugly hacks in
scripts/kallsyms.c):

  kallsyms_offsets:
          .long   0x1000 // do_undefinstr
          .long   0x1000 // efi_header_end
          .long   0x1000 // _stext
          .long   0x1000 // __exception_text_start
          .long   0x12b0 // do_cp15instr

Looking at the implementation of get_symbol_pos(), it returns the
lowest index for aliasing symbols. In this case, it return 0.

But kallsyms_lookup_size_offset() considers 0 as a failure, which
is obviously wrong (there is definitely a valid symbol living there).
In turn, the kprobe blacklisting stops abruptly, hence the original
error.

A CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL kernel wouldn't fail as there is always
some random symbols at the beginning of this array, which are never
looked up via kallsyms_lookup_size_offset.

Fix it by considering that get_symbol_pos() is always successful
(which is consistent with the other uses of this function).
