Revert "usb: dwc2: host: Setting qtd to NULL after freeing it"

This reverts commit b0d659022e5c96ee5c4bd62d22d3da2d66de306b.

The reverted commit does nothing but adding two unnecessary lines
of code.  It sets a local variable to NULL in two functions, but
that variable is not used anywhere in the rest of those functions.
This is just confusing, so let's remove it.
