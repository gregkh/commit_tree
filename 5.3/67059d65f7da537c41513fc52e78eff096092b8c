Revert "livepatch: Remove reliable stacktrace check in klp_try_switch_task()"

This reverts commit 1d98a69e5cef3aeb68bcefab0e67e342d6bb4dad. Commit
31adf2308f33 ("livepatch: Convert error about unsupported reliable
stacktrace into a warning") weakened the enforcement for architectures
to have reliable stack traces support. The system only warns now about
it.

It only makes sense to reintroduce the compile time checking in
klp_try_switch_task() again and bail out early.
