rcutorture: Add cond_resched() to forward-progress free-up loop

The rcu_torture_fwd_prog_cbfree() function frees callbacks used during
rcutorture's call_rcu() forward-progress test, but does so in a tight
loop.  This could cause problems given a very long list of callbacks to be
freed, and actual testing produces lists with as many as 25M callbacks.
This commit therefore adds a cond_resched() to this loop.  While in
the area, this commit also rearranges the lock releases to look a bit
more sane.
