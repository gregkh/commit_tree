irqchip/mbigen: Stop printing kernel addresses

After commit ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p"),
it will print "____ptrval____" instead of actual addresses when mbigen
create domain fails,

  Hisilicon MBIGEN-V2 HISI0152:00: Failed to create mbi-gen@(____ptrval____) irqdomain
  Hisilicon MBIGEN-V2: probe of HISI0152:00 failed with error -12

dev_xxx() helper contains the device info, HISI0152:00, which stands for
mbigen ACPI HID and its UID, we can identify the failing probed mbigen,
so just remove the printing "mgn_chip->base", and also add missing "\n".
