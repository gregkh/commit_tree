soc: imx: Add SCU SoC info driver support

Add i.MX SCU SoC info driver to support i.MX8QXP SoC, introduce
driver dependency into Kconfig as CONFIG_IMX_SCU must be
selected to support i.MX SCU SoC driver, also need to use
platform driver model to make sure IMX_SCU driver is probed
before i.MX SCU SoC driver.

With this patch, SoC info can be read from sysfs:

i.mx8qxp-mek# cat /sys/devices/soc0/family
Freescale i.MX

i.mx8qxp-mek# cat /sys/devices/soc0/soc_id
0x2

i.mx8qxp-mek# cat /sys/devices/soc0/machine
Freescale i.MX8QXP MEK

i.mx8qxp-mek# cat /sys/devices/soc0/revision
1.1
