lib/test_string.c: avoid masking memset16/32/64 failures

If a memsetXX implementation is completely broken and fails in the first
iteration, when i, j, and k are all zero, the failure is masked as zero
is returned.  Failing in the first iteration is perhaps the most likely
failure, so this makes the tests pretty much useless.  Avoid the
situation by always setting a random unused bit in the result on
failure.
