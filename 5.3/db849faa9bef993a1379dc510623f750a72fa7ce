net/mlx5e: Rx, Fix checksum calculation for new hardware

CQE checksum full mode in new HW, provides a full checksum of rx frame.
Covering bytes starting from eth protocol up to last byte in the received
frame (frame_size - ETH_HLEN), as expected by the stack.

Fixing up skb->csum by the driver is not required in such case. This fix
is to avoid wrong checksum calculation in drivers which already support
the new hardware with the new checksum mode.
