ALSA: firewire: fix a memory leak bug

In iso_packets_buffer_init(), 'b->packets' is allocated through
kmalloc_array(). Then, the aligned packet size is checked. If it is
larger than PAGE_SIZE, -EINVAL will be returned to indicate the error.
However, the allocated 'b->packets' is not deallocated on this path,
leading to a memory leak.

To fix the above issue, free 'b->packets' before returning the error code.
