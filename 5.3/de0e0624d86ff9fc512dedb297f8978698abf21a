RAS/CEC: Check count_threshold unconditionally

The count_threshold should be checked unconditionally, after insertion
too, so that a count_threshold value of 1 can cause an immediate
offlining. I.e., offline the page on the *first* error encountered.

Add comments to make it clear what cec_add_elem() does, while at it.
