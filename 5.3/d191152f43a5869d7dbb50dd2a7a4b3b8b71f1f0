IB/counters: Always initialize the port counter object

Port counter objects should be initialized even if alloc_stats is
unsupported, otherwise QP bind operations in user space can trigger a NULL
pointer deference if they try to bind QP on RDMA device which doesn't
support counters.

Fixes: f34a55e497e8 ("RDMA/core: Get sum value of all counters when perform a sysfs stat read")
