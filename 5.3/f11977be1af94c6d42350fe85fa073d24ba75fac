docs: s390: restore important non-kdoc parts of s390dbf.rst

Complements previous ("s390: include/asm/debug.h add kerneldoc markups")
which seemed to have dropped important non-kdoc parts such as
user space interface (level, size, flush)
as well as views and caution regarding strings in the sprintf view.
