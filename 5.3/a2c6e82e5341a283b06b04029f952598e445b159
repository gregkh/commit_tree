ARM: dts: meson: switch to the generic Ethernet PHY reset bindings

The snps,reset-gpio bindings are deprecated in favour of the generic
"Ethernet PHY reset" bindings.

Replace snps,reset-gpio from the &ethmac node with reset-gpios in the
ethernet-phy node. The old snps,reset-active-low property is now encoded
directly as GPIO flag inside the reset-gpios property.

snps,reset-delays-us is converted to reset-assert-us and
reset-deassert-us. reset-assert-us is the second cell from
snps,reset-delays-us while reset-deassert-us was the third cell.
Instead of blindly copying the old values (which seems strange since
they gave the PHY one second to come out of reset) over this also
updates the delays based on the datasheets:
- RTL8211F PHY on the Odroid-C1 and MXIII-Plus needs a 10ms assert
  delay (the datasheet mentions: "For a complete PHY reset, this pin
  must be asserted low for at least 10ms") and a 30ms deassert delay
  (the datasheet mentions: "Wait for a further 30ms (for internal
  circuits settling time) before accessing the PHY register"). The
  old settings used 10ms for assert and 1000ms for deassert.
- IP101GR PHY on the EC-100 and MXQ needs a 10ms assert delay (the
  datasheet mentions: "Trst | Reset period | 10ms") and a 10ms deassert
  delay as well (the datasheet mentions: "Tclk_MII_rdy | MII/RMII clock
  output ready after reset released | 10ms")). The old settings used
  10ms for assert and 1000ms for deassert.

No functional changes intended.
