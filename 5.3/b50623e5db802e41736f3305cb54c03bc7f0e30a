s390/airq: use DMA memory for adapter interrupts

Protected virtualization guests have to use shared pages for airq
notifier bit vectors, because the hypervisor needs to write these bits.

Let us make sure we allocate DMA memory for the notifier bit vectors by
replacing the kmem_cache with a dma_cache and kalloc() with
cio_dma_zalloc().
