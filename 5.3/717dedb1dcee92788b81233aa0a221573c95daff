ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: remove misleading error trace from IRQ thread

Downgrade "nothing to do in IRQ thread" message from error to a debug
message in the IPC interrupt handler thread.

The spurious wake-up can happen if a HDA stream interrupt is
raised while the IPC interrupt thread is running. IPC functionality
is not impacted by this condition, so debug is a more appropriate
trace level.
