bcache: add comments for mutex_lock(&b->write_lock)

When accessing or modifying BTREE_NODE_dirty bit, it is not always
necessary to acquire b->write_lock. In bch_btree_cache_free() and
mca_reap() acquiring b->write_lock is necessary, and this patch adds
comments to explain why mutex_lock(&b->write_lock) is necessary for
checking or clearing BTREE_NODE_dirty bit there.
