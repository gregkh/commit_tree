drm: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

Because there is no need to check these functions, a number of local
functions can be made to return void to simplify things as nothing can
fail.
