um: Remove locking in deactivate_all_fds()

Not only does the locking contradict the comment, and as
the comment says is pointless and actually harmful (all
the actual OS threads have exited already), but it also
causes crashes when lockdep is enabled, because calling
into the spinlock calls into lockdep, which then tries
to determine the current task, which no longer exists.

Remove the locking to let UML shut down cleanly in case
lockdep is enabled.
