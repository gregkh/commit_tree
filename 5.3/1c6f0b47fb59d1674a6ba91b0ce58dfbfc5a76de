KVM: nVMX: Track vmcs12 offsets for shadowed VMCS fields

The vmcs12 fields offsets are constant and known at compile time.  Store
the associated offset for each shadowed field to avoid the costly lookup
in vmcs_field_to_offset() when copying between vmcs12 and the shadow
VMCS.  Avoiding the costly lookup reduces the latency of copying by
~100 cycles in each direction.
