bdev: Fixup error handling in blkdev_get()

Commit 89e524c04fa9 ("loop: Fix mount(2) failure due to race with
LOOP_SET_FD") converted blkdev_get() to use the new helpers for
finishing claiming of a block device. However the conversion botched the
error handling in blkdev_get() and thus the bdev has been marked as held
even in case __blkdev_get() returned error. This led to occasional
warnings with block/001 test from blktests like:

kernel: WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 907 at fs/block_dev.c:1899 __blkdev_put+0x396/0x3a0

Correct the error handling.
