ACPI: configfs: Resolve objects on host-directed table loads

If an ACPI SSDT overlay is loaded after built-in tables
have been loaded e.g. via configfs or efivar_ssdt_load()
it is necessary to rewalk the namespace to resolve
references. Without this, relative and absolute paths
like ^PCI0.SBUS or \_SB.PCI0.SBUS are not resolved
correctly.

Make configfs loads use the same method as efivar_ssdt_load().
