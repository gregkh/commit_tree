s390/qeth: remove static cmd buffer infrastructure

Now that all cmds are dynamically allocated, the code for static cmd
buffers can go away entirely. Resulting in a nice reduction of
code/data size & complexity, while removing the risk that
qeth_clear_cmd_buffers() releases cmds that are still in-flight.
