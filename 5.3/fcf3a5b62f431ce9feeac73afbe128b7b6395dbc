mm: kmemleak: disable early logging in case of error

If an error occurs during kmemleak_init() (e.g.  kmem cache cannot be
created), kmemleak is disabled but kmemleak_early_log remains enabled.
Subsequently, when the .init.text section is freed, the log_early()
function no longer exists.  To avoid a page fault in such scenario,
ensure that kmemleak_disable() also disables early logging.
