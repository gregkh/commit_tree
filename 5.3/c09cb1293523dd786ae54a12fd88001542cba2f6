genirq: Update irq stats from NMI handlers

The NMI handlers handle_percpu_devid_fasteoi_nmi() and handle_fasteoi_nmi()
do not update the interrupt counts. Due to that the NMI interrupt count
does not show up correctly in /proc/interrupts.

Add the statistics and treat the NMI handlers in the same way as per cpu
interrupts and prevent them from updating irq_desc::tot_count as this might
be corrupted due to concurrency.
