ASoC: soc-pcm: add soc_pcm_components_open()

soc-pcm.c has soc_pcm_components_close() but not have its open()
side function. This kind of unbalance function is very unreadable.

And, current error handling is not correct.
Because it is using for_each_rtdcom() loop, we need to call
soc_pcm_components_close() anyway even though
CPU DAI .startup() failed.

This patch adds soc_pcm_components_open(), and fixup error
handling issue.
