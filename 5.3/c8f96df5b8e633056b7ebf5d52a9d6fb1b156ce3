scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix calculation of target ID

In megasas_get_target_prop(), driver is incorrectly calculating the target
ID for devices with channel 1 and 3.  Due to this, firmware will either
fail the command (if there is no device with the target id sent from
driver) or could return the properties for a target which was not
intended.  Devices could end up with the wrong queue depth due to this.

Fix target id calculation for channel 1 and 3.
