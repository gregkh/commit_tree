kbuild: add more hints about SUBDIRS replacement

Commit 0126be38d988 ("kbuild: announce removal of SUBDIRS if used")
added a hint about the 'SUBDIRS' replacement, but it was not clear
enough.

Multiple people sent me similar questions, patches. For instance,

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/1/17/456

I did not mean to use M= for building a subdirectory in the kernel tree.

From commit 669efc76b317 ("net: hns3: fix compile error"), people
already (ab)use M=... to do that because it seems to work to some extent.

Documentation/kbuild/kbuild.txt says M= and KBUILD_EXTMOD are used for
building external modules.

In fact, Kbuild supports the single target '%/' for this purpose, but
this may not be noticed much.

Kindly add more hints.
