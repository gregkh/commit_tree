KVM: arm/arm64: Add save/restore support for firmware workaround state

KVM implements the firmware interface for mitigating cache speculation
vulnerabilities. Guests may use this interface to ensure mitigation is
active.
If we want to migrate such a guest to a host with a different support
level for those workarounds, migration might need to fail, to ensure that
critical guests don't loose their protection.

Introduce a way for userland to save and restore the workarounds state.
On restoring we do checks that make sure we don't downgrade our
mitigation level.
