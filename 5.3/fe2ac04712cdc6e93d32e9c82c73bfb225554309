IB/rdmavt: Set QP allowed opcodes after QP allocation

Currently QP allowed_ops is set after the QP is completely initialized.
This curtails the use of this optimization for any initialization before
allowed_ops is set.

Fix by adding a helper to determine the correct allowed_ops and moving the
setting of the allowed_ops to just after QP allocation.
