staging: rtl8723bs: Remove function rtw_btcoex_SetDBG()

Remove function rtw_btcoex_SetDBG as all it does is call
hal_btcoex_setDBG.
Modify call sites accordingly.
Include the header file for hal_btcoex in the file that now calls
hal_btcoex_SetDBG instead of rtw_btcoex_SetDBG.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
