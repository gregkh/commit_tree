staging: kpc2000: kpc_spi: column-align switch and subordinate cases

The linux style guide prescribes that switch statements and their
subordinate case labels should be column-aligned rather than
double-indenting the case label. Make kpc2000_spi.c follow the desired
style with respect to switch/case alignment.
