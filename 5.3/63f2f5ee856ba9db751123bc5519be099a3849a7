libbpf: add ability to attach/detach BPF program to perf event

bpf_program__attach_perf_event allows to attach BPF program to existing
perf event hook, providing most generic and most low-level way to attach BPF
programs. It returns struct bpf_link, which should be passed to
bpf_link__destroy to detach and free resources, associated with a link.
