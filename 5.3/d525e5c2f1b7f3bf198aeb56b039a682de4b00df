media: cxusb: implement Medion MD95700 digital / analog coexistence

This patch prepares cxusb driver for supporting the analog part of
Medion 95700 (previously only the digital - DVB - mode was supported).

Specifically, it adds support for:
* switching the device between analog and digital modes of operation,
* enforcing that only one mode is active at the same time due to hardware
limitations.

Actual implementation of the analog mode will be provided by the next
commit.
