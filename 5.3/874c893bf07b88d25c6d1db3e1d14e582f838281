block: use blk_op_str() in blk-mq-debugfs.c

Now that we've a helper function blk_op_str() to convert the
REQ_OP_XXX to string XXX, adjust the code to use that. Get rid of
the duplicate array op_name which is now present in the blk-core.c
which we renamed it to "blk_op_name" and open coding in the
blk-mq-debugfs.c.
