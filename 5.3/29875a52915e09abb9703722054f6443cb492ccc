mm: Add an apply_to_pfn_range interface

This is basically apply_to_page_range with added functionality:
Allocating missing parts of the page table becomes optional, which
means that the function can be guaranteed not to error if allocation
is disabled. Also passing of the closure struct and callback function
becomes different and more in line with how things are done elsewhere.

Finally we keep apply_to_page_range as a wrapper around apply_to_pfn_range

The reason for not using the page-walk code is that we want to perform
the page-walk on vmas pointing to an address space without requiring the
mmap_sem to be held rather than on vmas belonging to a process with the
mmap_sem held.

Notable changes since RFC:
Don't export apply_to_pfn range.
