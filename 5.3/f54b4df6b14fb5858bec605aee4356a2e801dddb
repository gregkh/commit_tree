dt-bindings: display: renesas: lvds: Add renesas,companion property

Add a new optional renesas,companion property to point to the companion
LVDS encoder. This is used to support dual-link operation where the main
LVDS encoder splits even-numbered and odd-numbered pixels between the
two LVDS encoders.

The new property doesn't control the mode of operation, it only
describes the relationship between the master and companion LVDS
encoders.
