drm: Add drm_atomic_get_(old|new)_connector_for_encoder() helpers

Add functions to the atomic core to retrieve the old and new connectors
associated with an encoder in a drm_atomic_state. This is useful for
encoders and bridges that need to access the connector, for instance for
the drm_display_info.

The CRTC associated with the encoder can also be retrieved through the
connector state, and from it, the old and new CRTC states.
