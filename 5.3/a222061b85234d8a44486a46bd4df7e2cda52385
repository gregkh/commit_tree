genksyms: Teach parser about 128-bit built-in types

__uint128_t crops up in a few files that export symbols to modules, so
teach genksyms about it and the other GCC built-in 128-bit integer types
so that we don't end up skipping the CRC generation for some symbols due
to the parser failing to spot them:

  | WARNING: EXPORT symbol "kernel_neon_begin" [vmlinux] version
  |          generation failed, symbol will not be versioned.
  | ld: arch/arm64/kernel/fpsimd.o: relocation R_AARCH64_ABS32 against
  |     `__crc_kernel_neon_begin' can not be used when making a shared
  |     object
  | ld: arch/arm64/kernel/fpsimd.o:(.data+0x0): dangerous relocation:
  |     unsupported relocation
