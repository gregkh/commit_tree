powerpc/pci/of: Parse unassigned resources

The pseries platform uses the PCI_PROBE_DEVTREE method of PCI probing
which reads "assigned-addresses" of every PCI device and initializes
the device resources. However if the property is missing or zero sized,
then there is no fallback of any kind and the PCI resources remain
undiscovered, i.e. pdev->resource[] array remains empty.

This adds a fallback which parses the "reg" property in pretty much same
way except it marks resources as "unset" which later make Linux assign
those resources proper addresses.

This has an effect when:
1. a hypervisor failed to assign any resource for a device;
2. /chosen/linux,pci-probe-only=0 is in the DT so the system may try
assigning a resource.
Neither is likely to happen under PowerVM.
