KVM: selftests: Align memory region addresses to 1M on s390x

On s390x, there is a constraint that memory regions have to be aligned
to 1M (or running the VM will fail). Introduce a new "alignment" variable
in the vm_userspace_mem_region_add() function which now can be used for
both, huge page and s390x alignment requirements.
