dm table: fix invalid memory accesses with too high sector number

If the sector number is too high, dm_table_find_target() should return a
pointer to a zeroed dm_target structure (the caller should test it with
dm_target_is_valid).

However, for some table sizes, the code in dm_table_find_target() that
performs btree lookup will access out of bound memory structures.

Fix this bug by testing the sector number at the beginning of
dm_table_find_target(). Also, add an "inline" keyword to the function
dm_table_get_size() because this is a hot path.
