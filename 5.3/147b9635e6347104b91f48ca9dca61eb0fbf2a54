arm64: cpufeature: Fix feature comparison for CTR_EL0.{CWG,ERG}

If CTR_EL0.{CWG,ERG} are 0b0000 then they must be interpreted to have
their architecturally maximum values, which defeats the use of
FTR_HIGHER_SAFE when sanitising CPU ID registers on heterogeneous
machines.

Introduce FTR_HIGHER_OR_ZERO_SAFE so that these fields effectively
saturate at zero.
