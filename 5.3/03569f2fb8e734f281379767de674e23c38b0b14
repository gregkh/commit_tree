fscrypt: introduce fscrypt_encrypt_block_inplace()

fscrypt_encrypt_page() behaves very differently depending on whether the
filesystem set FS_CFLG_OWN_PAGES in its fscrypt_operations.  This makes
the function difficult to understand and document.  It also makes it so
that all callers have to provide inode and lblk_num, when fscrypt could
determine these itself for pagecache pages.

Therefore, move the FS_CFLG_OWN_PAGES behavior into a new function
fscrypt_encrypt_block_inplace().

This is in preparation for allowing encryption on ext4 filesystems with
blocksize != PAGE_SIZE.
