net: hns3: use HCLGE_STATE_ROCE_REGISTERED to indicate PF ROCE client has registered

When PF ROCE client's init_instance() succeeds, it means this client
has been registered successfully, so we use HCLGE_STATE_ROCE_REGISTERED
to indicate that. And before calling PF ROCE client's uninit_instance(),
we clear this state.

So any operation of the ROCE client from HCLGE is not allowed if this
state is not set.
