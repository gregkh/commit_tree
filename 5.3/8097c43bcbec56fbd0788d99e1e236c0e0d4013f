	Somehow this causes a regression in Linux next for me where I'm
	seeing lots of sysfs entries now missing under
	/sys/bus/platform/devices.

	For example, I now only see one .serial entry show up in sysfs.
	Things work again if I revert commit cc798c83898e ("kernfs: fix
	memleak inkernel_ops_readdir()"). Any ideas why that would be?

Tejun says:
	Ugh, you're right.  It can get double-put cuz ctx->pos is put by
	release too.

So reverting it for now.
