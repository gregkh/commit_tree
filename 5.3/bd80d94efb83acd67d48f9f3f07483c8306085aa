btrfs: Always use a cached extent_state in btrfs_lock_and_flush_ordered_range

In case no cached_state argument is passed to
btrfs_lock_and_flush_ordered_range use one locally in the function. This
optimises the case when an ordered extent is found since the unlock
function will be able to unlock that state directly without searching
for it again.
