crypto: testmgr - test the shash API

For hash algorithms implemented using the "shash" algorithm type, test
both the ahash and shash APIs, not just the ahash API.

Testing the ahash API already tests the shash API indirectly, which is
normally good enough.  However, there have been corner cases where there
have been shash bugs that don't get exposed through the ahash API.  So,
update testmgr to test the shash API too.

This would have detected the arm64 SHA-1 and SHA-2 bugs for which fixes
were just sent out (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10964843/ and
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10965089/):

    alg: shash: sha1-ce test failed (wrong result) on test vector 0, cfg="init+finup aligned buffer"
    alg: shash: sha224-ce test failed (wrong result) on test vector 0, cfg="init+finup aligned buffer"
    alg: shash: sha256-ce test failed (wrong result) on test vector 0, cfg="init+finup aligned buffer"

This also would have detected the bugs fixed by commit 307508d10729
("crypto: crct10dif-generic - fix use via crypto_shash_digest()") and
commit dec3d0b1071a
("crypto: x86/crct10dif-pcl - fix use via crypto_shash_digest()").
