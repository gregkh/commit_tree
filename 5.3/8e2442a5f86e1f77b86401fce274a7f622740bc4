kconfig: fix missing choice values in auto.conf

Since commit 00c864f8903d ("kconfig: allow all config targets to write
auto.conf if missing"), Kconfig creates include/config/auto.conf in the
defconfig stage when it is missing.

Joonas Kylmälä reported incorrect auto.conf generation under some
circumstances.

To reproduce it, apply the following diff:

|  --- a/arch/arm/configs/imx_v6_v7_defconfig
|  +++ b/arch/arm/configs/imx_v6_v7_defconfig
|  @@ -345,14 +345,7 @@ CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_F_MIDI=y

|  +CONFIG_USB_FUNCTIONFS=y
|   CONFIG_MMC=y
|   CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI=y
|   CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_PLTFM=y

And then, run:

$ make ARCH=arm mrproper imx_v6_v7_defconfig

You will see CONFIG_USB_FUNCTIONFS=y is correctly contained in the
.config, but not in the auto.conf.

Please note drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/Kconfig is included from a choice
block in drivers/usb/gadget/Kconfig. So USB_FUNCTIONFS is a choice value.

This is probably a similar situation described in commit beaaddb62540
("kconfig: tests: test defconfig when two choices interact").

When sym_calc_choice() is called, the choice symbol forgets the
SYMBOL_DEF_USER unless all of its choice values are explicitly set by
the user.

The choice symbol is given just one chance to recall it because
set_all_choice_values() is called if SYMBOL_NEED_SET_CHOICE_VALUES
is set.

When sym_calc_choice() is called again, the choice symbol forgets it
forever, since SYMBOL_NEED_SET_CHOICE_VALUES is a one-time aid.
Hence, we cannot call sym_clear_all_valid() again and again.

It is crazy to repeat set and unset of internal flags. However, we
cannot simply get rid of "sym->flags &= flags | ~SYMBOL_DEF_USER;"
Doing so would re-introduce the problem solved by commit 5d09598d488f
("kconfig: fix new choices being skipped upon config update").

To work around the issue, conf_write_autoconf() stopped calling
sym_clear_all_valid().

conf_write() must be changed accordingly. Currently, it clears
SYMBOL_WRITE after the symbol is written into the .config file. This
is needed to prevent it from writing the same symbol multiple times in
case the symbol is declared in two or more locations. I added the new
flag SYMBOL_WRITTEN, to track the symbols that have been written.

Anyway, this is a cheesy workaround in order to suppress the issue
as far as defconfig is concerned.

Handling of choices is totally broken. sym_clear_all_valid() is called
every time a user touches a symbol from the GUI interface. To reproduce
it, just add a new symbol drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/Kconfig, then touch
around unrelated symbols from menuconfig. USB_FUNCTIONFS will disappear
from the .config file.

I added the Fixes tag since it is more fatal than before. But, this
has been broken since long long time before, and still it is.
We should take a closer look to fix this correctly somehow.
