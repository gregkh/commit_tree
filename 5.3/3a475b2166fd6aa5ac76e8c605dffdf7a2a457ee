kbuild: Inform user to pass ARCH= for make mrproper

When cross-compiling an out-of-tree build with an unclean source tree
directory, the build fails with:

  /path/to/kernel/source/tree is not clean, please run 'make mrproper'
  in the '/path/to/kernel/source/tree' directory.

However, doing so does not fix the problem, as "make mrproper" now
requires passing the target architecture to the make command, else it
won't remove $(srctree)/arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/generated.
"git ls-files -o" doesn't give a clue, as it doesn't list (empty)
directories, only files.

Improve usability by including the ARCH= option in the error output.
