tcp: inherit timestamp on mtu probe

TCP associates tx timestamp requests with a byte in the bytestream.
If merging skbs in tcp_mtu_probe, migrate the tstamp request.

Similar to MSG_EOR, do not allow moving a timestamp from any segment
in the probe but the last. This to avoid merging multiple timestamps.

Tested with the packetdrill script at
https://github.com/wdebruij/packetdrill/commits/mtu_probe-1
