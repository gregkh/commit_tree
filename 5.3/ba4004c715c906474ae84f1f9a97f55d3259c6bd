pwm: meson: Use devm_clk_get_optional() to get the input clock

Simplify the code which fetches the input clock for a PWM channel by
using devm_clk_get_optional().
This comes with a small functional change: previously all errors except
EPROBE_DEFER were ignored. Now all other errors are also treated as
errors. If no input clock is present devm_clk_get_optional() will return
NULL instead of an error which matches the behavior of the old code.
