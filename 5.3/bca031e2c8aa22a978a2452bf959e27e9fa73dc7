KVM: arm/arm64: Introduce kvm_pmu_vcpu_init() to setup PMU counter index

We use "pmc->idx" and the "chained" bitmap to determine if the pmc is
chained, in kvm_pmu_pmc_is_chained().  But idx might be uninitialized
(and random) when we doing this decision, through a KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT
ioctl -> kvm_pmu_vcpu_reset(). And the test_bit() against this random
idx will potentially hit a KASAN BUG [1].

In general, idx is the static property of a PMU counter that is not
expected to be modified across resets, as suggested by Julien.  It
looks more reasonable if we can setup the PMU counter idx for a vcpu
in its creation time. Introduce a new function - kvm_pmu_vcpu_init()
for this basic setup. Oh, and the KASAN BUG will get fixed this way.
