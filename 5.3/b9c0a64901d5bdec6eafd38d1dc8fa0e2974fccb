perf annotate: Fix s390 gap between kernel end and module start

During execution of command 'perf top' the error message:

   Not enough memory for annotating '__irf_end' symbol!)

is emitted from this call sequence:
  __cmd_top
    perf_top__mmap_read
      perf_top__mmap_read_idx
        perf_event__process_sample
          hist_entry_iter__add
            hist_iter__top_callback
              perf_top__record_precise_ip
                hist_entry__inc_addr_samples
                  symbol__inc_addr_samples
                    symbol__get_annotation
                      symbol__alloc_hist

In this function the size of symbol __irf_end is calculated. The size of
a symbol is the difference between its start and end address.

When the symbol was read the first time, its start and end was set to:

   symbol__new: __irf_end 0xe954d0-0xe954d0

which is correct and maps with /proc/kallsyms:

   root@s8360046:~/linux-4.15.0/tools/perf# fgrep _irf_end /proc/kallsyms
   0000000000e954d0 t __irf_end
   root@s8360046:~/linux-4.15.0/tools/perf#

In function symbol__alloc_hist() the end of symbol __irf_end is

  symbol__alloc_hist sym:__irf_end start:0xe954d0 end:0x3ff80045a8

which is identical with the first module entry in /proc/kallsyms

This results in a symbol size of __irf_req for histogram analyses of
70334140059072 bytes and a malloc() for this requested size fails.

The root cause of this is function
  __dso__load_kallsyms()
  +-> symbols__fixup_end()

Function symbols__fixup_end() enlarges the last symbol in the kallsyms
map:

   # fgrep __irf_end /proc/kallsyms
   0000000000e954d0 t __irf_end
   #

to the start address of the first module:
   # cat /proc/kallsyms | sort  | egrep ' [tT] '
   ....
   0000000000e952d0 T __security_initcall_end
   0000000000e954d0 T __initramfs_size
   0000000000e954d0 t __irf_end
   000003ff800045a8 T fc_get_event_number       [scsi_transport_fc]
   000003ff800045d0 t store_fc_vport_disable    [scsi_transport_fc]
   000003ff800046a8 T scsi_is_fc_rport  [scsi_transport_fc]
   000003ff800046d0 t fc_target_setup   [scsi_transport_fc]

On s390 the kernel is located around memory address 0x200, 0x10000 or
0x100000, depending on linux version. Modules however start some- where
around 0x3ff xxxx xxxx.

This is different than x86 and produces a large gap for which histogram
allocation fails.

Fix this by detecting the kernel's last symbol and do no adjustment for
it. Introduce a weak function and handle s390 specifics.
