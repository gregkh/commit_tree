iio: adc: stm32-dfsdm: fix output resolution

In buffered mode, output samples are shifted left
unconditionally. This works for filter order 3,
but this shift is not adapted for other filter orders.
Compute required shift, left or right, and shift
output data accordingly.
Add also saturation management to avoid wrap-around
when maximum positive sample is reached.
