doc: RCU callback locks need only _bh, not necessarily _irq

The UP.rst file calls for locks acquired within RCU callback functions
to use _irq variants (spin_lock_irqsave() or similar), which does work,
but can be overkill.  This commit therefore instead calls for _bh variants
(spin_lock_bh() or similar), while noting that _irq does work.
