net: openvswitch: do not update max_headroom if new headroom is equal to old headroom

When a vport is deleted, the maximum headroom size would be changed.
If the vport which has the largest headroom is deleted,
the new max_headroom would be set.
But, if the new headroom size is equal to the old headroom size,
updating routine is unnecessary.
