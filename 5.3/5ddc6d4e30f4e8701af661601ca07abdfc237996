cpufreq: Use has_target() instead of !setpolicy

For code consistency, use has_target() instead of !setpolicy everywhere,
as it is already done at several places. Maybe we should also use
"!has_target()" instead of "cpufreq_driver->setpolicy" where we need to
check if the driver supports setpolicy, so to use only one expression
for this kind of differentiation.
