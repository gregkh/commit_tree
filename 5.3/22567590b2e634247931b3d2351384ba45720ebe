netfilter: bridge: namespace bridge netfilter sysctls

Currently, the /proc/sys/net/bridge folder is only created in the initial
network namespace. This patch ensures that the /proc/sys/net/bridge folder
is available in each network namespace if the module is loaded and
disappears from all network namespaces when the module is unloaded.

In doing so the patch makes the sysctls:

bridge-nf-call-arptables
bridge-nf-call-ip6tables
bridge-nf-call-iptables
bridge-nf-filter-pppoe-tagged
bridge-nf-filter-vlan-tagged
bridge-nf-pass-vlan-input-dev

apply per network namespace. This unblocks some use-cases where users would
like to e.g. not do bridge filtering for bridges in a specific network
namespace while doing so for bridges located in another network namespace.

The netfilter rules are afaict already per network namespace so it should
be safe for users to specify whether bridge devices inside a network
namespace are supposed to go through iptables et al. or not. Also, this can
already be done per-bridge by setting an option for each individual bridge
via Netlink. It should also be possible to do this for all bridges in a
network namespace via sysctls.
