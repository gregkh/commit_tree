nfsd4: drc containerization

The nfsd duplicate reply cache should not be shared between network
namespaces.

The most straightforward way to fix this is just to move every global in
the code to per-net-namespace memory, so that's what we do.

Still todo: sort out which members of nfsd_stats should be global and
which per-net-namespace.
