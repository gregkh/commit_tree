PCI: Decode PCIe 32 GT/s link speed

PCIe r5.0, sec 7.5.3.18, defines a new 32.0 GT/s bit in the Supported Link
Speeds Vector of Link Capabilities 2.  Decode this new speed.  This does
not affect the speed of the link, which should be negotiated automatically
by the hardware; it only adds decoding when showing the speed to the user.

Previously, reading the speed of a link operating at this speed showed
"Unknown speed" instead of "32.0 GT/s".
