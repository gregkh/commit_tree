iommu/io-pgtable: Replace IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NO_DMA with specific flag

IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NO_DMA is a bit of a misnomer, since it's really just
an indication of whether or not the page-table walker for the IOMMU is
coherent with the CPU caches. Since cache coherency is more than just a
quirk, replace the flag with its own field in the io_pgtable_cfg
structure.
