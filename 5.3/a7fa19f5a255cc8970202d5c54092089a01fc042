perf intel-pt: Add intel_pt_fast_forward()

Intel PT decoding is done in time order. In order to support efficient time
interval filtering, add a facility to "fast forward" towards a particular
timestamp. That involves finding the right buffer, stepping to that buffer,
and then stepping forward PSBs. Because decoding must begin at a PSB,
"fast forward" stops at the last PSB that has a timestamp before the target
timestamp.
