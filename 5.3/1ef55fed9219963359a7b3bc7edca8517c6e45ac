regulator: axp20x: fix DCDCA and DCDCD for AXP806

Refactoring of the driver introduced bugs in AXP806's DCDCA and DCDCD
regulator definitions.

In DCDCA case, AXP806_DCDCA_1120mV_STEPS was obtained by subtracting
0x47 and 0x33. This should be 0x14 (hex) and not 14 (dec).

In DCDCD case, axp806_dcdcd_ranges[] contains two ranges with same
start and end macros, which is clearly wrong. Second range starts at
1.6V so it should use AXP806_DCDCD_1600mV_[START|END] macros. They are
already defined but unused.
