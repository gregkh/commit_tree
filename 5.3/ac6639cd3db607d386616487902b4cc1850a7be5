s390/qdio: don't touch the dsci in tiqdio_add_input_queues()

Current code sets the dsci to 0x00000080. Which doesn't make any sense,
as the indicator area is located in the _left-most_ byte.

Worse: if the dsci is the _shared_ indicator, this potentially clears
the indication of activity for a _different_ device.
tiqdio_thinint_handler() will then have no reason to call that device's
IRQ handler, and the device ends up stalling.
