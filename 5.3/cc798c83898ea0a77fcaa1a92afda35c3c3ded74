kernfs: fix memleak in kernel_ops_readdir()

If getdents64 is killed or hits on segfault, it'll leave cgroups
directories in sysfs pinned leaking memory because the kernfs node
won't be freed on rmdir and the parent neither.

Repro:

  # for i in `seq 1000`; do mkdir $i; done
  # rmdir *
  # for i in `seq 1000`; do mkdir $i; done
  # rmdir *

  # for i in `seq 1000`; do while :; do ls $i/ >/dev/null; done & done
  # while :; do killall ls; done

  kernfs_node_cache in /proc/slabinfo keeps going up as expected.
