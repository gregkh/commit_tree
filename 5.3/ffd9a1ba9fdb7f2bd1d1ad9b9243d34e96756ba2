ARM: riscpc: fix DMA

DMA got broken a while back in two different ways:
1) a change in the behaviour of disable_irq() to wait for the interrupt
   to finish executing causes us to deadlock at the end of DMA.
2) a change to avoid modifying the scatterlist left the first transfer
   uninitialised.

DMA is only used with expansion cards, so has gone unnoticed.
