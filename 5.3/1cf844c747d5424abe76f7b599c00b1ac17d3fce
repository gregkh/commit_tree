ipv6: Make fib6_nh optional at the end of fib6_info

Move fib6_nh to the end of fib6_info and make it an array of
size 0. Pass a flag to fib6_info_alloc indicating if the
allocation needs to add space for a fib6_nh.

The current code path always has a fib6_nh allocated with a
fib6_info; with nexthop objects they will be separate.
