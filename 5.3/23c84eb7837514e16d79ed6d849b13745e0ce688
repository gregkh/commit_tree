dax: Fix missed wakeup with PMD faults

RocksDB can hang indefinitely when using a DAX file.  This is due to
a bug in the XArray conversion when handling a PMD fault and finding a
PTE entry.  We use the wrong index in the hash and end up waiting on
the wrong waitqueue.

There's actually no need to wait; if we find a PTE entry while looking
for a PMD entry, we can return immediately as we know we should fall
back to a PTE fault (which may not conflict with the lock held).

We reuse the XA_RETRY_ENTRY to signal a conflicting entry was found.
This value can never be found in an XArray while holding its lock, so
it does not create an ambiguity.
