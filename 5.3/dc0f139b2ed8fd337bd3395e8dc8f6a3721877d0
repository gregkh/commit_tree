staging: rtl8712: Replace r8712_free_evt_priv()

Remove function r8712_free_evt_priv as all it does is call
_free_evt_priv.
Rename _free_evt_priv to r8712_free_evt_priv to maintain compatibility
with call sites.
Change type of new r8712_free_evt_priv from static to non-static to
match old definition.
