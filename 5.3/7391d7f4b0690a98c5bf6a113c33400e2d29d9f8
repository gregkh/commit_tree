dt-bindings: clk: meson: add g12b periph clock controller bindings

Update the documentation to support clock driver for the Amlogic G12B SoC.

G12B clock driver is very close, the main differences are :
- the clock tree is duplicated for the both clusters, and the
  SYS_PLL are swapped between the clusters
- G12B has additional clocks like for CSI an other components
