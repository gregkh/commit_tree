crypto: caam - fix S/G table passing page boundary

According to CAAM RM:
-crypto engine reads 4 S/G entries (64 bytes) at a time,
even if the S/G table has fewer entries
-it's the responsibility of the user / programmer to make sure
this HW behaviour has no side effect

The drivers do not take care of this currently, leading to IOMMU faults
when the S/G table ends close to a page boundary - since only one page
is DMA mapped, while CAAM's DMA engine accesses two pages.

Fix this by rounding up the number of allocated S/G table entries
to a multiple of 4.
Note that in case of two *contiguous* S/G tables, only the last table
might needs extra entries.
