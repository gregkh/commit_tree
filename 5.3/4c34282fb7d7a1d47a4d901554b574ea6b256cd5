clk: pwm: implement the .get_duty_cycle callback

Commit 9fba738a53dda2 ("clk: add duty cycle support") added support for
getting and setting the duty cycle of a clock. This implements the
get_duty_cycle callback for PWM based clocks so the duty cycle is shown
in the debugfs output (/sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary).
