media: dvb-usb-v2: Report error on all error paths

actual_length != wlen is the only error path which does not generate an
error message. Adding an error message here allows to report a more
specific error and to remove the error reporting from the call sites.

Also clean up the error paths - in case of an error, the remaining
code is skipped, and ret is returned. Skip setting ret and return
immediately (no cleanup necessary).
