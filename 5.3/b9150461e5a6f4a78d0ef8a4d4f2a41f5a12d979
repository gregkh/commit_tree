s390/qeth: dynamically allocate various cmds with sub-types

This patch converts the adapter, assist and bridgeport cmd paths to
dynamic allocation. Most of the work is about re-organizing the cmd
headers, calculating the correct cmd length, and filling in the right
value in the sub-cmd's length field.

Since we now also set the correct length for cmds that are not reflected
by a fixed struct (ie SNMP), we can remove the work-around from
qeth_snmp_command().
