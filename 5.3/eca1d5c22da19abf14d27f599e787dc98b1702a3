s390/qeth: move cast type selection into fill_header()

The cast type currently gets selected in .ndo_start_xmit, and is then
piped through several layers until it's stored into the HW header.
Push the selection down into qeth_l?_fill_header() to (1) reduce the
number of xmit-wide parameters, and (2) merge the two route validation
checks into just one.
