net: stmmac: manage errors returned by of_get_mac_address()

Commit d01f449c008a ("of_net: add NVMEM support to of_get_mac_address")
added support for reading the MAC address from an nvmem-cell. This
required changing the logic to return an error pointer upon failure.

If stmmac is loaded before the nvmem provider driver then
of_get_mac_address() return an error pointer with -EPROBE_DEFER.

Propagate this error so the stmmac driver will be probed again after the
nvmem provider driver is loaded.
Default to a random generated MAC address in case of any other error,
instead of using the error pointer as MAC address.
