net/mlx5e: Refactor struct mlx5e_xdp_info

Currently, struct mlx5e_xdp_info has some issues that have to be cleaned
up before the upcoming AF_XDP support makes things too complicated and
messy. This structure is used both when sending the packet and on
completion. Moreover, the cleanup procedure on completion depends on the
origin of the packet (XDP_REDIRECT, XDP_TX). Adding AF_XDP support will
add new flows that use this structure even differently. To avoid
overcomplicating the code, this commit refactors the usage of this
structure in the following ways:

1. struct mlx5e_xdp_info is split into two different structures. One is
struct mlx5e_xdp_xmit_data, a transient structure that doesn't need to
be stored and is only used while sending the packet. The other is still
struct mlx5e_xdp_info that is stored in a FIFO and contains the fields
needed on completion.

2. The fields of struct mlx5e_xdp_info that are used in different flows
are put into a union. A special enum indicates the cleanup mode and
helps choose the right union member. This approach is clear and
explicit. Although it could be possible to "guess" the mode by looking
at the values of the fields and at the XDP SQ type, it wouldn't be that
clear and extendable and would require looking through the whole chain
to understand what's going on.

For the reference, there are the fields of struct mlx5e_xdp_info that
are used in different flows (including AF_XDP ones):

Packet origin          | Fields used on completion | Cleanup steps
-----------------------+---------------------------+------------------
XDP_REDIRECT,          | xdpf, dma_addr            | DMA unmap and
XDP_TX from XSK RQ     |                           | xdp_return_frame.
-----------------------+---------------------------+------------------
XDP_TX from regular RQ | di                        | Recycle page.
-----------------------+---------------------------+------------------
AF_XDP TX              | (none)                    | Increment the
                       |                           | producer index in
                       |                           | Completion Ring.

On send, the same set of mlx5e_xdp_xmit_data fields is used in all
flows: DMA and virtual addresses and length.
