nvme-pci: properly report state change failure in nvme_reset_work

If the state change to NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING fails, the dmesg is going to
be like:

  [  293.689160] nvme nvme0: failed to mark controller CONNECTING
  [  293.689160] nvme nvme0: Removing after probe failure status: 0

Even it prints the first line to indicate the situation, the second line
is not proper because the status is 0 which means normally success of
the previous operation.

This patch makes it indicate the proper error value when it fails.
  [   25.932367] nvme nvme0: failed to mark controller CONNECTING
  [   25.932369] nvme nvme0: Removing after probe failure status: -16

This situation is able to be easily reproduced by:
  root@target:~# rmmod nvme && modprobe nvme && rmmod nvme
