ALSA: firewire-lib: add data_blocks/data_block_counter parameter to in_packet/out_packet tracing events

Tracing events for packets without CIP header have a parameter of
data_blocks/data_block_counter, but events for packets with CIP header
don't. This is not good to unify these events.

This commit adds the missing parameters to the events. In timing to
probe 'in_packet' event, data_blocks and data_block_counter are not
calculated yet. This commit also changes the timing.
