Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix virt_to_hvpfn() for X86_PAE

In the case of X86_PAE, unsigned long is u32, but the physical address type
should be u64. Due to the bug here, the netvsc driver can not load
successfully, and sometimes the VM can panic due to memory corruption (the
hypervisor writes data to the wrong location).
