ARM: dts: rockchip: Add pin names for rk3288-veyron-minnie

We can now use the "gpio-line-names" property to provide the names for
all the pins on a board.  Let's use this to provide the names for all
the pins on rk3288-veyron-minnie.

In general the names here come straight from the schematic.  That
means even if the schematic name is weird / doesn't have consistent
naming conventions / has typos I still haven't made any changes.

The exception here is for two pins: the recovery switch and the write
protect detection pin.  These two pins need to have standardized names
since crossystem (a Chrome OS tool) uses these names to query the
pins.  In downstream kernels crossystem used an out-of-tree driver to
do this but it has now been moved to the gpiod API and needs the
standardized names.

It's expected that other rk3288-veyron boards will get similar patches
shortly.

NOTE: I have sorted the "gpio" section to be next to the "pinctrl"
section since it seems to logically make the most sense there.
