openvswitch: Fix conntrack cache with timeout

This patch addresses a conntrack cache issue with timeout policy.
Currently, we do not check if the timeout extension is set properly in the
cached conntrack entry.  Thus, after packet recirculate from conntrack
action, the timeout policy is not applied properly.  This patch fixes the
aforementioned issue.
