perf scripts python: export-to-sqlite.py: Export Intel PT power and ptwrite events

The format of synthesized events is determined by the attribute config.
For the formats for Intel PT power and ptwrite events, create tables and
populate them when the synth_data handler is called. If the tables
remain empty, drop them at the end.

The tables and views, including a combined power_events_view, will
display automatically from the tables menu of the exported
exported-sql-viewer.py script.

Note, currently only Atoms since Gemini Lake have support for ptwrite
and mwait, pwre, exstop and pwrx, but all Intel PT implementations
support cbr.
