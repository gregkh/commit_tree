mm/balloon_compaction: avoid duplicate page removal

A #GP is reported in the guest when requesting balloon inflation via
virtio-balloon. The reason is that the virtio-balloon driver has
removed the page from its internal page list (via balloon_page_pop),
but balloon_page_enqueue_one also calls "list_del"  to do the removal.
This is necessary when it's used from balloon_page_enqueue_list, but
not from balloon_page_enqueue.

Move list_del to balloon_page_enqueue, and update comments accordingly.
