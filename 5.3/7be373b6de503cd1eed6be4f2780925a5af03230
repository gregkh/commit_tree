KVM: LAPIC: remove the trailing newline used in the fmt parameter of TP_printk

The trailing newlines will lead to extra newlines in the trace file
which looks like the following output, so remove it.

qemu-system-x86-15695 [002] ...1 15774.839240: kvm_hv_timer_state: vcpu_id 0 hv_timer 1

qemu-system-x86-15695 [002] ...1 15774.839309: kvm_hv_timer_state: vcpu_id 0 hv_timer 1
