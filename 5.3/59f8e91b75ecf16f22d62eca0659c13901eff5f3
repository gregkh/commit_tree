nfsd4: use reference count to free client

Keep a second reference count which is what is really used to decide
when to free the client's memory.

Next I'm going to add an nfsd/clients/ directory with a subdirectory for
each NFSv4 client.  File objects under nfsd/clients/ will hold these
references.
