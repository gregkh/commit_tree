bcache: add reclaimed_journal_buckets to struct cache_set

Now we have counters for how many times jouranl is reclaimed, how many
times cached dirty btree nodes are flushed, but we don't know how many
jouranl buckets are really reclaimed.

This patch adds reclaimed_journal_buckets into struct cache_set, this
is an increasing only counter, to tell how many journal buckets are
reclaimed since cache set runs. From all these three counters (reclaim,
reclaimed_journal_buckets, flush_write), we can have idea how well
current journal space reclaim code works.
