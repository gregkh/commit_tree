docs: add some directories to the main documentation index

The contents of those directories were orphaned at the documentation
body.

While those directories could likely be moved to be inside some guide,
I'm opting to just adding their indexes to the main one, removing the
:orphan: and adding the SPDX header.

For the drivers, the rationale is that the documentation contains
a mix of Kernelspace, uAPI and admin-guide. So, better to keep them on
separate directories, as we've be doing with similar subsystem-specific
docs that were not split yet.

For the others, well... I'm too lazy to do the move. Also, it
seems to make sense to keep at least some of those at the main
dir (like kbuild, for example). In any case, a latter patch
could do the move.
