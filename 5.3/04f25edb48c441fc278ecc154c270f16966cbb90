net: hns3: add some error checking in hclge_tm module

When hdev->tx_sch_mode is HCLGE_FLAG_VNET_BASE_SCH_MODE, the
hclge_tm_schd_mode_vnet_base_cfg calls hclge_tm_pri_schd_mode_cfg
with vport->vport_id as pri_id, which is used as index for
hdev->tm_info.tc_info, it will cause out of bound access issue
if vport_id is equal to or larger than HNAE3_MAX_TC.

Also hardware only support maximum speed of HCLGE_ETHER_MAX_RATE.

So this patch adds two checks for above cases.
