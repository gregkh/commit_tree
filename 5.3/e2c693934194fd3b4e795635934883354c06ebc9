ipv4/icmp: fix rt dst dev null pointer dereference

In __icmp_send() there is a possibility that the rt->dst.dev is NULL,
e,g, with tunnel collect_md mode, which will cause kernel crash.
Here is what the code path looks like, for GRE:

- ip6gre_tunnel_xmit
  - ip6gre_xmit_ipv4
    - __gre6_xmit
      - ip6_tnl_xmit
        - if skb->len - t->tun_hlen - eth_hlen > mtu; return -EMSGSIZE
    - icmp_send
      - net = dev_net(rt->dst.dev); <-- here

The reason is __metadata_dst_init() init dst->dev to NULL by default.
We could not fix it in __metadata_dst_init() as there is no dev supplied.
On the other hand, the reason we need rt->dst.dev is to get the net.
So we can just try get it from skb->dev when rt->dst.dev is NULL.

v4: Julian Anastasov remind skb->dev also could be NULL. We'd better
still use dst.dev and do a check to avoid crash.

v3: No changes.

v2: fix the issue in __icmp_send() instead of updating shared dst dev
in {ip_md, ip6}_tunnel_xmit.
