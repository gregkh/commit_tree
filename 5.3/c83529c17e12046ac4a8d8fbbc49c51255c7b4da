hwmon: (pmbus/adm1275) support PMBUS_VIRT_*_SAMPLES

The device supports setting the number of samples for averaging the
measurements. There are two separate settings - PWR_AVG for averaging
PIN and VI_AVG for averaging VIN/VAUX/IOUT, both being part of
PMON_CONFIG register. The values are stored as exponent of base 2 of the
actual number of samples that will be taken.
