Revert "PCI/IOV: Use VF0 cached config space size for other VFs"

Revert 975bb8b4dc93 ("PCI/IOV: Use VF0 cached config space size for other
VFs"), which attempted to cache the config space size from the first VF to
re-use for subsequent VFs.

The cached value was determined prior to discovering the PCIe capability on
the VF, which resulted in the first VF reporting the correct config space
size (4K), as it has a special case through pci_cfg_space_size(), while all
the other VFs only reported 256 bytes.  As this was only a performance
optimization, we're better off without it.
