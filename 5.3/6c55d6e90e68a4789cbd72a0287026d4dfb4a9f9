drm/amdkfd: support concurrent userptr update for HMM

Userptr restore may have concurrent userptr invalidation after
hmm_vma_fault adds the range to the hmm->ranges list, needs call
hmm_vma_range_done to remove the range from hmm->ranges list first,
then reschedule the restore worker. Otherwise hmm_vma_fault will add
same range to the list, this will cause loop in the list because
range->next point to range itself.

Add function untrack_invalid_user_pages to reduce code duplication.
