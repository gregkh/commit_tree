fsnotify: get rid of fsnotify_nameremove()

For all callers of fsnotify_{unlink,rmdir}(), we made sure that d_parent
and d_name are stable.  Therefore, fsnotify_{unlink,rmdir}() do not need
the safety measures in fsnotify_nameremove() to stabilize parent and name.
We can now simplify those hooks and get rid of fsnotify_nameremove().
