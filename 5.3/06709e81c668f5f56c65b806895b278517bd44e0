lib: logic_pio: Fix RCU usage

The traversing of io_range_list with list_for_each_entry_rcu()
is not properly protected by rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock(),
so add them.

These functions mark the critical section scope where the list is
protected for the reader, it cannot be  "reclaimed". Any updater - in
this case, the logical PIO registration functions - cannot update the
list until the reader exits this critical section.

In addition, the list traversing used in logic_pio_register_range()
does not need to use the rcu variant.

This is because we are already using io_range_mutex to guarantee mutual
exclusion from mutating the list.
