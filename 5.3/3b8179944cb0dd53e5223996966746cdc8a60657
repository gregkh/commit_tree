ALSA: compress: Be more restrictive about when a drain is allowed

Draining makes little sense in the situation of hardware overrun, as the
hardware will have consumed all its available samples. Additionally,
draining whilst the stream is paused would presumably get stuck as no
data is being consumed on the DSP side.
