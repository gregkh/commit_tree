sched/uclamp: Add bucket local max tracking

Because of bucketization, different task-specific clamp values are
tracked in the same bucket.  For example, with 20% bucket size and
assuming to have:

  Task1: util_min=25%
  Task2: util_min=35%

both tasks will be refcounted in the [20..39]% bucket and always boosted
only up to 20% thus implementing a simple floor aggregation normally
used in histograms.

In systems with only few and well-defined clamp values, it would be
useful to track the exact clamp value required by a task whenever
possible. For example, if a system requires only 23% and 47% boost
values then it's possible to track the exact boost required by each
task using only 3 buckets of ~33% size each.

Introduce a mechanism to max aggregate the requested clamp values of
RUNNABLE tasks in the same bucket. Keep it simple by resetting the
bucket value to its base value only when a bucket becomes inactive.
Allow a limited and controlled overboosting margin for tasks recounted
in the same bucket.

In systems where the boost values are not known in advance, it is still
possible to control the maximum acceptable overboosting margin by tuning
the number of clamp groups. For example, 20 groups ensure a 5% maximum
overboost.

Remove the rq bucket initialization code since a correct bucket value
is now computed when a task is refcounted into a CPU's rq.
