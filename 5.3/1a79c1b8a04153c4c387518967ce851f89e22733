x86/kexec: Do not map kexec area as decrypted when SEV is active

When a virtual machine panics, its memory needs to be dumped for
analysis. With memory encryption in the picture, special care must be
taken when loading a kexec/kdump kernel in a SEV guest.

A SEV guest starts and runs fully encrypted. In order to load a kexec
kernel and initrd, arch_kexec_post_{alloc,free}_pages() need to not map
areas as decrypted unconditionally but differentiate whether the kernel
is running as a SEV guest and if so, leave kexec area encrypted.
