drm/amd/display: Gamma logic limitations causing unintended use of RAM over ROM.

[Why]
Our existing logic in deciding whether to use RAM or ROM
depends on whether we are dealing with an identity gamma ramp.

[How]
In addition to the is_identity flag
a new is_logical_identity flag has been
added. The is_identity flag now denotes
whether the OS gamma is an RGB256 identity
and the new logical identity will inidicate
that the given gamma ramp regardless of its
type is identity.
