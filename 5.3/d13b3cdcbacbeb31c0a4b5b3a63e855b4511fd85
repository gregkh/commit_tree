media: vimc: Makefile: file cleanup

Remove redundant Makefile rules (vimc_capture-objs, ...).

Stop exposing vimc-{common, streamer} as modules, since there's no use
case where they would be individually added/removed from Vimc. As
consequence, remove MODULE_ macros from vimc-{common, streamer}.

`-objs` is fitted for building host programs, change to `-y`, more
straightforward for device drivers.
