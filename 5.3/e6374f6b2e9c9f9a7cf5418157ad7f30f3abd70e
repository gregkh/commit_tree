acpi: utils: Cleanup acpi_dev_match_cb

The prototype of bus_find_device() will be unified with that of
class_find_device() subsequently, but for this purpose the callback
functions passed to it need to take (const void *) as the second
argument.  Consequently, they cannot modify the memory pointed to by
that argument which currently is not the case for acpi_dev_match_cb().
However, acpi_dev_match_cb() really need not modify the "match" object
passed to it, because acpi_dev_get_first_match_dev() which uses it via
bus_find_device() can easily convert the result of bus_find_device()
into the pointer to return.

For this reason, update acpi_dev_match_cb() to avoid the redundant
memory updates.
