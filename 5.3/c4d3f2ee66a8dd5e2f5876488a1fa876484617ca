iwlwifi: pcie: increase the size of PCI dumps

Currently we dump only the first 64 bytes of the PCI config space,
which leaves out some important things, such as the base address
registers.

Increase it to 352 for the PCI device and to 524 for the rootport to
make sure we include everything we need.
