s390/cio: Remove vfio-ccw checks of command codes

If the CCW being processed is a No-Operation, then by definition no
data is being transferred.  Let's fold those checks into the normal
CCW processors, rather than skipping out early.

Likewise, if the CCW being processed is a "test" (a category defined
here as an opcode that contains zero in the lowest four bits) then no
special processing is necessary as far as vfio-ccw is concerned.
These command codes have not been valid since the S/370 days, meaning
they are invalid in the same way as one that ends in an eight [1] or
an otherwise valid command code that is undefined for the device type
in question.  Considering that, let's just process "test" CCWs like
any other CCW, and send everything to the hardware.

[1] POPS states that a x08 is a TIC CCW, and that having any high-order
bits enabled is invalid for format-1 CCWs.  For format-0 CCWs, the
high-order bits are ignored.
