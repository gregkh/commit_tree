rtc: stm32: remove one condition check in stm32_rtc_set_alarm()

A condition check was repeated in this function implementation despite of
a corresponding check in the stm32_rtc_alarm_irq_enable() function.
Thus delete redundant source code here.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
