netfilter: xt_owner: Add supplementary groups option

The XT_OWNER_SUPPL_GROUPS flag causes GIDs specified with XT_OWNER_GID
to be also checked in the supplementary groups of a process.

f_cred->group_info cannot be modified during its lifetime and f_cred
holds a reference to it so it's safe to use.
