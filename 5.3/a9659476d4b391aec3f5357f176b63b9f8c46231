mm/failslab.c: by default, do not fail allocations with direct reclaim only

When failslab was originally written, the intention of the
"ignore-gfp-wait" flag default value ("N") was to fail GFP_ATOMIC
allocations.  Those were defined as (__GFP_HIGH), and the code would test
for __GFP_WAIT (0x10u).

However, since then, __GFP_WAIT was replaced by __GFP_RECLAIM
(___GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM|___GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM), and GFP_ATOMIC is now
defined as (__GFP_HIGH|__GFP_ATOMIC|__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM).

This means that when the flag is false, almost no allocation ever fails
(as even GFP_ATOMIC allocations contain ___GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM).

Restore the original intent of the code, by ignoring calls that directly
reclaim only (__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM), and thus, failing GFP_ATOMIC calls
again by default.
