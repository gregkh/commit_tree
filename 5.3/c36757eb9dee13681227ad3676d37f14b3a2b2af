net: phy: consider AN_RESTART status when reading link status

After configuring and restarting aneg we immediately try to read the
link status. On some systems the PHY may not yet have cleared the
"aneg complete" and "link up" bits, resulting in a false link-up
signal. See [0] for a report.
Clause 22 and 45 both require the PHY to keep the AN_RESTART
bit set until the PHY actually starts auto-negotiation.
Let's consider this in the generic functions for reading link status.
The commit marked as fixed is the first one where the patch applies
cleanly.
