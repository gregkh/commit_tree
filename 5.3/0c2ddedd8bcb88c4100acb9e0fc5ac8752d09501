intel_rapl: support two power limits for every RAPL domain

RAPL MSR interface supports 2 power limits for package domain, and 1 power
limit for other domains, while RAPL MMIO interface supports 2 power limits
for both package and dram domains.
And when 2 power limits are supported, the FW_LOCK bit is in bit 63 of the
register, instead of bit 31.

Remove the assumption that only pakcage domain supports 2 power limits.
And allow the RAPL interface driver to specify the number of power limits
supported, for every single RAPL domain it owns..
