media: drivers: media: coda: fix warning same module names

When building with CONFIG_VIDEO_CODA and CONFIG_CODA_FS enabled as
loadable modules, we see the following warning:

  fs/coda/coda.ko
  drivers/media/platform/coda/coda.ko

Rework so media/platform/coda is named coda-vpu. Leaving CODA_FS as is
since that's a well known module.
