fonts: Prefer a bigger font for high resolution screens

Although we may have multiple fonts in kernel, the small 8x16 font is
chosen as default usually unless user specify the boot option.  This
is suboptimal for monitors with high resolutions.

This patch tries to assign a bigger font for such a high resolution by
calculating some penalty value.  This won't change anything for a
standard monitor like Full HD (1920x1080), but for a high res monitor
like UHD 4K, a bigger font like TER16x32 will be chosen once when
enabled in Kconfig.
