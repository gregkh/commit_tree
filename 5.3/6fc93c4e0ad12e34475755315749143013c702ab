f2fs: use generic checking function for FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR

Make the f2fs implementation of FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR use the new VFS helper
function vfs_ioc_fssetxattr_check(), and remove the project quota check
since it's now done by the helper function.

This is based on a patch from Darrick Wong, but reworked to apply after
commit 360985573b55 ("f2fs: separate f2fs i_flags from fs_flags and ext4
i_flags").
