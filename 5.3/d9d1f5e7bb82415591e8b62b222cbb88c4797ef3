IB/hfi1: Drop stale TID RDMA packets that cause TIDErr

In a congested fabric with adaptive routing enabled, traces show that
packets could be delivered out of order. A stale TID RDMA data packet
could lead to TidErr if the TID entries have been released by duplicate
data packets generated from retries, and subsequently erroneously force
the qp into error state in the current implementation.

Since the payload has already been dropped by hardware, the packet can
be simply dropped and it is no longer necessary to put the qp into
error state.
