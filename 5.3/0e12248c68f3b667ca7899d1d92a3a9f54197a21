clk: imx6q: fix section mismatch warning

The imx6q_obtain_fixed_clk_hw lacks an __init marker, which
leads to this otherwise harmless warning:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x495358): Section mismatch in reference from the function imx6q_obtain_fixed_clk_hw() to the function .init.text:imx_obtain_fixed_clock_hw()
The function imx6q_obtain_fixed_clk_hw() references
the function __init imx_obtain_fixed_clock_hw().
This is often because imx6q_obtain_fixed_clk_hw lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of imx_obtain_fixed_clock_hw is wrong.
