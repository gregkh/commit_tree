kbuild: do not create empty modules.order in the prepare stage

Currently, $(objtree)/modules.order is touched in two places.

In the 'prepare0' rule, scripts/Makefile.build creates an empty
modules.order while processing 'obj=.'

In the 'modules' rule, the top-level Makefile overwrites it with
the correct list of modules.

While this might be a good side-effect that modules.order is made
empty every time (probably this is not intended functionality),
I personally do not like this behavior.

Create modules.order only when it is sensible to do so.

This avoids creating the following pointless files:

  scripts/basic/modules.order
  scripts/dtc/modules.order
  scripts/gcc-plugins/modules.order
  scripts/genksyms/modules.order
  scripts/mod/modules.order
  scripts/modules.order
  scripts/selinux/genheaders/modules.order
  scripts/selinux/mdp/modules.order
  scripts/selinux/modules.order

Going forward, $(objtree)/modules.order lists the modules that
was built in the last successful build.
