genirq/affinity: Create affinity mask for single vector

Since commit c66d4bd110a1f8 ("genirq/affinity: Add new callback for
(re)calculating interrupt sets"), irq_create_affinity_masks() returns
NULL in case of single vector. This change has caused regression on some
drivers, such as lpfc.

The problem is that single vector requests can happen in some generic cases:

  1) kdump kernel

  2) irq vectors resource is close to exhaustion.

If in that situation the affinity mask for a single vector is not created,
every caller has to handle the special case.

There is no reason why the mask cannot be created, so remove the check for
a single vector and create the mask.
