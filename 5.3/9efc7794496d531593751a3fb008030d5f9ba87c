libbpf: emit diff of mismatched public API, if any

It's easy to have a mismatch of "intended to be public" vs really
exposed API functions. While Makefile does check for this mismatch, if
it actually occurs it's not trivial to determine which functions are
accidentally exposed. This patch dumps out a diff showing what's not
supposed to be exposed facilitating easier fixing.
