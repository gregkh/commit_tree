Btrfs: remove unused variables in __btrfs_unlink_inode

This code was first introduced in 5f39d397dfbe ("Btrfs: Create
extent_buffer interface for large blocksizes") and the function was
named btrfs_unlink_trans. It later got renamed to __btrfs_unlink_inode
and finally commit 16cdcec736cd ("btrfs: implement delayed inode items
operation") changed the way inodes are deleted and obviated the need for
those two members.
