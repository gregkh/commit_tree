mm/hotplug: make remove_memory() interface usable

Presently the remove_memory() interface is inherently broken.  It tries
to remove memory but panics if some memory is not offline.  The problem
is that it is impossible to ensure that all memory blocks are offline as
this function also takes lock_device_hotplug that is required to change
memory state via sysfs.

So, between calling this function and offlining all memory blocks there
is always a window when lock_device_hotplug is released, and therefore,
there is always a chance for a panic during this window.

Make this interface to return an error if memory removal fails.  This
way it is safe to call this function without panicking machine, and also
makes it symmetric to add_memory() which already returns an error.
