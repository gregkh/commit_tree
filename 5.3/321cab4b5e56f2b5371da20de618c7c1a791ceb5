staging: rts5208: Simplify boolean expression to improve code style

This bitwisen / boolean expression can be made more readable while
reducing the line lengths at the same time. This commit uses the
fact that

    a & (b | c) == (b | c)

evaluates to true if and only if

    (a & b) && (a & c)

is true. Since b and c are constants with relatively long names,
using the second form makes the code much more readable and shorter.
