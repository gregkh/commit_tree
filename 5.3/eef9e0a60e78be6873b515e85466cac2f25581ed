mmc: sdhci-sprd: Add start_signal_voltage_switch ops

For Spreadtrum SD host controller, we can not use standard SD registers
to change and detect the I/O voltage signals, since our voltage regulator
for I/O is fixed in hardware, and no signals were connected to the SD
controller. Thus add Spreadtrum specific voltage switch ops to change
voltage instead of using standard SD host registers.
