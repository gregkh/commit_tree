scsi: lpfc: Fix nvmet target abort cmd matching

After receiving an unsolicited ABTS (meaning rxid is 0xFFFF), the driver
used the oxid from the initiator to match against a local xri which may
have been allocated for the io. The xri would be the rxid - it's an invalid
check resulting in the command not being matched or erroneously matched.

Change the lookup to use the oxid and the SID to match against received
IO's original values.
