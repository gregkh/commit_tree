powerpc/cacheflush: fix variable set but not used

The powerpc's flush_cache_vmap() is defined as a macro and never use
both of its arguments, so it will generate a compilation warning,

lib/ioremap.c: In function 'ioremap_page_range':
lib/ioremap.c:203:16: warning: variable 'start' set but not used
[-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Fix it by making it an inline function.
