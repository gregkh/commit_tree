media: touchscreen/sur40: set device_caps in struct video_device

Instead of filling in the struct v4l2_capability device_caps
field, fill in the struct video_device device_caps field.

That way the V4L2 core knows what the capabilities of the
video device are.

But this only really works if all drivers use this, so convert
this touchscreen driver accordingly.
