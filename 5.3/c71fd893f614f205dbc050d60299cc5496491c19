locking/rwsem: Make owner available even if !CONFIG_RWSEM_SPIN_ON_OWNER

The owner field in the rw_semaphore structure is used primarily for
optimistic spinning. However, identifying the rwsem owner can also be
helpful in debugging as well as tracing locking related issues when
analyzing crash dump. The owner field may also store state information
that can be important to the operation of the rwsem.

So the owner field is now made a permanent member of the rw_semaphore
structure irrespective of CONFIG_RWSEM_SPIN_ON_OWNER.
