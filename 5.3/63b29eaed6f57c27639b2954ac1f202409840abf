torture: Make kvm-find-errors.sh and kvm-recheck.sh provide exit status

This commit causes both kvm-find-errors.sh and kvm-recheck.sh to provide
an exit status based on whether or not errors were located.  In the
case of kvm-recheck.sh, this will be the error status of the last run.
This change allows these commands to be used in scripting and Makefiles
to automatically report failed rcutorture runs.
