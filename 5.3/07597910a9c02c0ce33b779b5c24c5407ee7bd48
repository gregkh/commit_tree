ASoC: dapm: Use struct_size() in krealloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding the
size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along with
memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct foo {
    int stuff;
    struct boo entry[];
};

instance = krealloc(instance, sizeof(struct foo) + count * sizeof(struct boo), GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, use the new
struct_size() helper:

instance = krealloc(instance, struct_size(instance, entry, count), GFP_KERNEL);

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
