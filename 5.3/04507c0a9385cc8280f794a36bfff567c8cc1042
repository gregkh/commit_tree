cpupower : frequency-set -r option misses the last cpu in related cpu list

To set frequency on specific cpus using cpupower, following syntax can
be used :
cpupower -c #i frequency-set -f #f -r

While setting frequency using cpupower frequency-set command, if we use
'-r' option, it is expected to set frequency for all cpus related to
cpu #i. But it is observed to be missing the last cpu in related cpu
list. This patch fixes the problem.
