x86, boot: Remove multiple copy of static function sanitize_boot_params()

Kernel build warns:
 'sanitize_boot_params' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

at below files:
  arch/x86/boot/compressed/cmdline.c
  arch/x86/boot/compressed/error.c
  arch/x86/boot/compressed/early_serial_console.c
  arch/x86/boot/compressed/acpi.c

That's becausethey each include misc.h which includes a definition of
sanitize_boot_params() via bootparam_utils.h.

Remove the inclusion from misc.h and have the c file including
bootparam_utils.h directly.
