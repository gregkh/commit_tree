RDMA/rxe: Fill in wc byte_len with IB_WC_RECV_RDMA_WITH_IMM

Calculate the correct byte_len on the receiving side when a work
completion is generated with IB_WC_RECV_RDMA_WITH_IMM opcode.

According to the IBA byte_len must indicate the number of written bytes,
whereas it was always equal to zero for the IB_WC_RECV_RDMA_WITH_IMM
opcode, even though data was transferred.
