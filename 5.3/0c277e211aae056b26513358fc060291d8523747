bcache: add pendings_cleanup to stop pending bcache device

If a bcache device is in dirty state and its cache set is not
registered, this bcache device will not appear in /dev/bcache<N>,
and there is no way to stop it or remove the bcache kernel module.

This is an as-designed behavior, but sometimes people has to reboot
whole system to release or stop the pending backing device.

This sysfs interface may remove such pending bcache devices when
write anything into the sysfs file manually.
