iwlwifi: mvm: fix an out-of-bound access

The index for the elements of the ACPI object we dereference
was static. This means that if we called the function twice
we wouldn't start from 3 again, but rather from the latest
index we reached in the previous call.
This was dutifully reported by KASAN.

Fix this.
