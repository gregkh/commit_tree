drm/amd/display: Mark DSC resource as unused after copying to the secondary ODM pipe

[why]
DSC resource has to be acquired before it can be used and simply copying
a reference to it is very likely to cause problems when accessing DSC.

[how]
Set DSC resource pointer to NULL to mark it as unused after primary pipe
resources were copied to the secondary ODM pipe.
