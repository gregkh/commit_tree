x86: Add "nopv" parameter to disable PV extensions

In virtualization environment, PV extensions (drivers, interrupts,
timers, etc) are enabled in the majority of use cases which is the
best option.

However, in some cases (kexec not fully working, benchmarking)
we want to disable PV extensions. We have "xen_nopv" for that purpose
but only for XEN. For a consistent admin experience a common command
line parameter "nopv" set across all PV guest implementations is a
better choice.

There are guest types which just won't work without PV extensions,
like Xen PV, Xen PVH and jailhouse. add a "ignore_nopv" member to
struct hypervisor_x86 set to true for those guest types and call
the detect functions only if nopv is false or ignore_nopv is true.
