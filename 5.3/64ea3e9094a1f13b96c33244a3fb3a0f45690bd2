gpio: omap: fix lack of irqstatus_raw0 for OMAP4

Commit 384ebe1c2849 ("gpio/omap: Add DT support to GPIO driver") added
the register definition tables to the gpio-omap driver. Subsequently to
that commit, commit 4e962e8998cc ("gpio/omap: remove cpu_is_omapxxxx()
checks from *_runtime_resume()") added definitions for irqstatus_raw*
registers to the legacy OMAP4 definitions, but missed the DT
definitions.

This causes an unintentional change of behaviour for the 1.101 errata
workaround on OMAP4 platforms. Fix this oversight.
