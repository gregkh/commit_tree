mm/hmm: Simplify hmm_get_or_create and make it reliable

As coded this function can false-fail in various racy situations. Make it
reliable and simpler by running under the write side of the mmap_sem and
avoiding the false-failing compare/exchange pattern. Due to the mmap_sem
this no longer has to avoid racing with a 2nd parallel
hmm_get_or_create().

Unfortunately this still has to use the page_table_lock as the
non-sleeping lock protecting mm->hmm, since the contexts where we free the
hmm are incompatible with mmap_sem.
