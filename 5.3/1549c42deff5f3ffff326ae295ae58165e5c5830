powerpc/powernv: Update firmware archaeology around OPAL_HANDLE_HMI

The first machines to ship with OPAL firmware all got firmware updates
that have the new call, but just in case someone is foolish enough to
believe the first 4 months of firmware is the best, we keep this code
around.

Comment is updated to not refer to late 2014 as recent or the future.
