nbd: add netlink reconfigure resize support

If the device is setup with ioctl we can resize the device after the
initial setup, but if the device is setup with netlink we cannot use the
resize related ioctls and there is no netlink reconfigure size ATTR
handling code.

This patch adds netlink reconfigure resize support to match the ioctl
interface.
