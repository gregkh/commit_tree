vfio-ccw: Factor out the ccw0-to-ccw1 transition

This is a really useful function, but it's buried in the
copy_ccw_from_iova() routine so that ccwchain_calc_length()
can just work with Format-1 CCWs while doing its counting.
But it means we're translating a full 2K of "CCWs" to Format-1,
when in reality there's probably far fewer in that space.

Let's factor it out, so maybe we can do something with it later.
