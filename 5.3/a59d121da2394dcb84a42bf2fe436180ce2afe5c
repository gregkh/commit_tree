s390/qeth: dynamically allocate simple IPA cmds

This patch reduces the usage of the write channel's static cmd buffers,
by dynamically allocating all simple IPA cmds (eg. STARTLAN, SETVMAC).
It also converts the OSN path.

Doing so requires some changes to how we calculate the cmd length.
Currently when building IPA cmds, we're quite generous in how much data
we send down to the device (basically the size of the biggest cmd we
know). This is no real concern at the moment, since the static cmd
buffers are backed with zeroed pages. But for dynamic allocations, the
exact length matters. So this patch also adds the needed length
calculations to each cmd path.

Commands that have multiple subtypes (eg. SETADP) of differing length
will be converted with follow-up patches.
