torture: Make --cpus override idleness calculations

Currently, rcutorture will use relatively few CPUs to build the kernel
on a busy system, which is often as it should be.  However, if the user
has used the --cpus argument to dedicate a specified number of CPUs to
this torture test, it would be good if the kernel build also made use
of them.  This commit therefore changes the cpus2use.sh script to use
--cpus when specified and to do the idleness calculations otherwise.
