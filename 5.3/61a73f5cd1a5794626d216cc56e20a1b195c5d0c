x86/head/64: Annotate start_cpu0() as non-callable

After an objtool improvement, it complains about the fact that
start_cpu0() jumps to code which has an LRET instruction.

  arch/x86/kernel/head_64.o: warning: objtool: .head.text+0xe4: unsupported instruction in callable function

Technically, start_cpu0() is callable, but it acts nothing like a
callable function.  Prevent objtool from treating it like one by
removing its ELF function annotation.
