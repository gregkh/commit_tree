pwm: meson: Unify the parameter list of meson_pwm_{enable, disable}

This is a preparation for a future cleanup. Pass struct pwm_device
instead of passing the individual values required by each function as
these can be obtained for each struct pwm_device instance.

As a nice side-effect the driver now uses "switch (pwm->hwpwm)"
everywhere. Before some functions used "switch (id)" while others used
"switch (pwm->hwpwm)".

No functional changes.
