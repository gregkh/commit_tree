serial: stm32: Add support of TC bit status check

Adds a check on the Transmission Complete bit status before closing the
com port. Prevents the port closure before the end of the transmission.
TC poll loop is moved from stm32_tx_dma_complete to stm32_shutdown
routine, in order to check TC before shutdown in both dma and
PIO tx modes.
TC clear is added in stm32_transmit_char routine, in order to be cleared
before transmitting in both dma and PIO tx modes.
