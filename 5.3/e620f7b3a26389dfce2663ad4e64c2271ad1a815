drm/i915: Extend I915_CONTEXT_PARAM_SSEU to support local ctx->engine[]

Allow the user to specify a local engine index (as opposed to
class:index) that they can use to refer to a preset engine inside the
ctx->engine[] array defined by an earlier I915_CONTEXT_PARAM_ENGINES.
This will be useful for setting SSEU parameters on virtual engines that
are local to the context and do not have a valid global class:instance
lookup.

Note that due to the ambiguity in using class:instance with
ctx->engines[], if a user supplied engine map is active the user must
specify the engine to alter by its index into the ctx->engines[].
