bpf: fix uapi bpf_prog_info fields alignment

Merge commit 1c8c5a9d38f60 ("Merge
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next") undid the
fix from commit 36f9814a494 ("bpf: fix uapi hole for 32 bit compat
applications") by taking the gpl_compatible 1-bit field definition from
commit b85fab0e67b162 ("bpf: Add gpl_compatible flag to struct
bpf_prog_info") as is. That breaks architectures with 16-bit alignment
like m68k. Add 31-bit pad after gpl_compatible to restore alignment of
following fields.

Thanks to Dmitry V. Levin his analysis of this bug history.
