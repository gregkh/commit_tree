net/tls: add missing prot info init

Turns out TLS_TX in HW offload mode does not initialize tls_prot_info.
Since commit 9cd81988cce1 ("net/tls: use version from prot") we actually
use this field on the datapath.  Luckily we always compare it to TLS 1.3,
and assume 1.2 otherwise. So since zero is not equal to 1.3, everything
worked fine.
