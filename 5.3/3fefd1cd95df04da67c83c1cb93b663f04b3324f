KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix CR0 setting in TM emulation

When emulating tsr, treclaim and trechkpt, we incorrectly set CR0. The
code currently sets:
    CR0 <- 00 || MSR[TS]
but according to the ISA it should be:
    CR0 <-  0 || MSR[TS] || 0

This fixes the bit shift to put the bits in the correct location.

This is a data integrity issue as CR0 is corrupted.
