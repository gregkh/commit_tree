genirq/timings: Add selftest for next event computation

The circular buffers are now validated with selftests. The next interrupt
index algorithm which is the hardest part to validate needs extra coverage.

Add a selftest which uses the intervals stored in the arrays and insert all
the values except the last one. The next event computation must return the
same value as the last element which was not inserted.
