tpm: Fix TPM 1.2 Shutdown sequence to prevent future TPM operations

TPM 2.0 Shutdown involve sending TPM2_Shutdown to TPM chip and disabling
future TPM operations. TPM 1.2 behavior was different, future TPM
operations weren't disabled, causing rare issues. This patch ensures
that future TPM operations are disabled.
