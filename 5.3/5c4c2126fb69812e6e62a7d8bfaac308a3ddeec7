s390: vfio-ap: fix irq registration

vfio_ap_free_aqic_resources is called in two places:
- during registration to have a "known state"
- during interrupt disable

We must not clear q->matrix_mdev in the registration phase as this will
mess up the reference counting and can lead to some warning and other
bugs.
