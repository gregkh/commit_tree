crypto: testmgr - fix length truncation with large page size

On PowerPC with CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS=y, there is sometimes
a crash in generate_random_aead_testvec().  The problem is that the
generated test vectors use data lengths of up to about 2 * PAGE_SIZE,
which is 128 KiB on PowerPC; however, the data length fields in the test
vectors are 'unsigned short', so the lengths get truncated.  Fix this by
changing the relevant fields to 'unsigned int'.
