gpio: ath79: Pass irqchip when adding gpiochip

We need to convert all old gpio irqchips to pass the irqchip
setup along when adding the gpio_chip.

For chained irqchips this is a pretty straight-forward
conversion.

Take this opportunity to add a local dev pointer and
use devm_gpiochip_add() so we can get rid of the remove()
callback altogether.
