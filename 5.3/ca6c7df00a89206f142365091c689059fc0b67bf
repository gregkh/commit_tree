net/mlx5e: TX, Improve performance under GSO workload

__netdev_tx_sent_queue() was introduced by:
commit 3e59020abf0f ("net: bql: add __netdev_tx_sent_queue()")

BQL counters should be updated without flipping/caring about
BQL status, if the current skb has xmit_more set.

Using __netdev_tx_sent_queue() avoids messing with BQL stop
flag, increases performance on GSO workload by keeping
doorbells to the minimum required and also sparing atomic
operations.
