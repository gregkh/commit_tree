s390/qeth: allocate a single cmd on read channel

We statically allocate 8 cmd buffers on the read channel, when the only
IO left that's still using them is the long-running READ.
Replace this with a single allocated cmd, that gets restarted whenever
the READ completed.

This introduces refcounting for allocated cmds, so that the READ cmd can
survive the IO completion.
