be2net: Synchronize be_update_queues with dev_watchdog

As pointed out by Firo Yang, a netdev tx timeout may trigger just before an
ethtool set_channels operation is started. be_tx_timeout(), which dumps
some queue structures, is not written to run concurrently with
be_update_queues(), which frees/allocates those queues structures. Add some
synchronization between the two.
