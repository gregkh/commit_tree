memremap: lift the devmap_enable manipulation into devm_memremap_pages

Just check if there is a ->page_free operation set and take care of the
static key enable, as well as the put using device managed resources.
Also check that a ->page_free is provided for the pgmaps types that
require it, and check for a valid type as well while we are at it.

Note that this also fixes the fact that hmm never called
dev_pagemap_put_ops and thus would leave the slow path enabled forever,
even after a device driver unload or disable.
