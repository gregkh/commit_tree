configfs: provide exclusion between IO and removals

Make sure that attribute methods are not called after the item
has been removed from the tree.  To do so, we
	* at the point of no return in removals, grab ->frag_sem
exclusive and mark the fragment dead.
	* call the methods of attributes with ->frag_sem taken
shared and only after having verified that the fragment is still
alive.

	The main benefit is for method instances - they are
guaranteed that the objects they are accessing *and* all ancestors
are still there.  Another win is that we don't need to bother
with extra refcount on config_item when opening a file -
the item will be alive for as long as it stays in the tree, and
we won't touch it/attributes/any associated data after it's
been removed from the tree.
