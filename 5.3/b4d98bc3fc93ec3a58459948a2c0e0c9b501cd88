staging: comedi: dt3000: Fix signed integer overflow 'divider * base'

In `dt3k_ns_to_timer()` the following lines near the end of the function
result in a signed integer overflow:

	prescale = 15;
	base = timer_base * (1 << prescale);
	divider = 65535;
	*nanosec = divider * base;

(`divider`, `base` and `prescale` are type `int`, `timer_base` and
`*nanosec` are type `unsigned int`.  The value of `timer_base` will be
either 50 or 100.)

The main reason for the overflow is that the calculation for `base` is
completely wrong.  It should be:

	base = timer_base * (prescale + 1);

which matches an earlier instance of this calculation in the same
function.
