tools/memory-model: Prepare for data-race detection

This patch makes some slight alterations to linux-kernel.cat in
preparation for adding support for data-race detection to the
Linux-Kernel Memory Model.

	The definitions of relations involved in Acquire, Release, and
	unlock-lock ordering are moved up earlier in the source file.

	The rmb relation is factored through the new R4rmb class: the
	class of reads to which rmb will apply.

	The definition of the fence relation is moved earlier, and it
	is split up into read- and write-fences (rmb and wmb) and all
	the others.

This should not make any functional changes.
