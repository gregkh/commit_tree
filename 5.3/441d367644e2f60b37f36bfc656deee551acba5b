iversion: add a routine to update a raw value with a larger one

Under ceph, clients can be independently updating iversion themselves,
while working under comprehensive sets of caps on an inode. In that
situation we always want to prefer the largest value of a change
attribute. Add a new function that will update a raw value with a larger
one, but otherwise leave it alone.
