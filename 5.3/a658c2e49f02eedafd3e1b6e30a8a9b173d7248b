net: sched: act_ctinfo: fix action creation

Use correct return value on action creation: ACT_P_CREATED.

The use of incorrect return value could result in a situation where the
system thought a ctinfo module was listening but actually wasn't
instantiated correctly leading to an OOPS in tcf_generic_walker().

Confession time: Until very recently, development of this module has
been done on 'net-next' tree to 'clean compile' level with run-time
testing on backports to 4.14 & 4.19 kernels under openwrt.  During the
back & forward porting during development & testing, the critical
ACT_P_CREATED return code got missed despite being in the 4.14 & 4.19
backports.  I have now gone through the init functions, using act_csum
as reference with a fine toothed comb.  Bonus, no more OOPSes.  I
managed to also miss this issue till now due to the new strict
nla_parse_nested function failing validation before action creation.

As an inexperienced developer I've learned that
copy/pasting/backporting/forward porting code correctly is hard.  If I
ever get to a developer conference I shall don the cone of shame.
