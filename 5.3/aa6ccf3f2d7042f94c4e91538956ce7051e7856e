ice: Fix couple of issues in ice_vsi_release

Currently the driver is calling ice_napi_del() and then
unregister_netdev(). The call to unregister_netdev() will result in a
call to ice_stop() and then ice_vsi_close(). This is where we call
napi_disable() for all the MSI-X vectors. This flow is reversed so make
the changes to ensure napi_disable() happens prior to napi_del().

Before calling napi_del() and free_netdev() make sure
unregister_netdev() was called. This is done by making sure the
__ICE_DOWN bit is set in the vsi->state for the interested VSI.
