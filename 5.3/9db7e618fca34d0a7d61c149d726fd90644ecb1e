net/mlx5e: Convert single case statement switch statements into if statements

During the review of commit 1ff2f0fa450e ("net/mlx5e: Return in default
case statement in tx_post_resync_params"), Leon and Nick pointed out
that the switch statements can be converted to single if statements
that return early so that the code is easier to follow.
