qed: Fix -Wmaybe-uninitialized false positive

A previous attempt to shut up the uninitialized variable use
warning was apparently insufficient. When CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES
is set, gcc-8 still warns, because the unlikely() check in DP_NOTICE()
causes it to no longer track the state of all variables correctly:

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_dev.c: In function 'qed_llh_set_ppfid_affinity':
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_dev.c:798:47: error: 'abs_ppfid' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
  addr = NIG_REG_PPF_TO_ENGINE_SEL + abs_ppfid * 0x4;
                                     ~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~

This is not a nice workaround, but always initializing the output from
qed_llh_abs_ppfid() at least shuts up the false positive reliably.
