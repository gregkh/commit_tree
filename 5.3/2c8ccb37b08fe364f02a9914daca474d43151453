RDMA/siw: Change CQ flags from 64->32 bits

This patch changes the driver/user shared (mmapped) CQ notification
flags field from unsigned 64-bits size to unsigned 32-bits size. This
enables building siw on 32-bit architectures.

This patch changes the siw-abi, but as siw was only just merged in
this merge window cycle, there are no released kernels with the prior
abi.  We are making no attempt to be binary compatible with siw user
space libraries prior to the merge of siw into the upstream kernel,
only moving forward with upstream kernels and upstream rdma-core
provided siw libraries are we guaranteeing compatibility.
