USB: use genalloc for USB HCs with local memory

For HCs that have local memory, replace the current DMA API usage with
a genalloc generic allocator to manage the mappings for these devices.
To help users, introduce a new HCD API, usb_hcd_setup_local_mem() that
will setup up the genalloc backing up the device local memory. It will
be used in subsequent patches.  This is in preparation for dropping
the existing "coherent" dma mem declaration APIs.  The current
implementation was relying on a short circuit in the DMA API that in
the end, was acting as an allocator for these type of devices.
