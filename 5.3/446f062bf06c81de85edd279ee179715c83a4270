MIPS: use the generic get_user_pages_fast code

The mips code is mostly equivalent to the generic one, minus various
bugfixes and an arch override for gup_fast_permitted.

Note that this defines ARCH_HAS_PTE_SPECIAL for mips as mips has
pte_special and pte_mkspecial implemented and used in the existing gup
code.  They are no-op stubs, though which makes me a little unsure if this
is really right thing to do.

Note that this also adds back a missing cpu_has_dc_aliases check for
__get_user_pages_fast, which the old code was only doing for
get_user_pages_fast.  This clearly looks like an oversight, as any
condition that makes get_user_pages_fast unsafe also applies to
__get_user_pages_fast.
