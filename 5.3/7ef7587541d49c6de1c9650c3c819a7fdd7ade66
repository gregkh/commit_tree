RDMA/hns: fix potential integer overflow on left shift

There is a potential integer overflow when int i is left shifted as this
is evaluated using 32 bit arithmetic but is being used in a context that
expects an expression of type dma_addr_t.  Fix this by casting integer i
to dma_addr_t before shifting to avoid the overflow.
