habanalabs: Allow accessing host mapped addresses via debugfs

Allows using the addr/data32 debugfs nodes to access a device VA of a
host mapped memory when the IOMMU is disabled.

Due to the possible large amount of a user host mapped memory, the
driver doesn't maintain a database with the host addresses per device VA.
When the IOMMU is disabled, this missing info is being overcome by
simply using phys_to_virt(). However, this is not useful when the IOMMU
is enabled, and thus the enforced limitation.
