drm/amd/powerplay: Use memset to initialize metrics structs

clang warns:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../powerplay/navi10_ppt.c:601:33: warning:

        static SmuMetrics_t metrics = {0};

One way to fix these warnings is to add additional braces like clang
suggests; however, there has been a bit of push back from some
maintainers[1][2], who just prefer memset as it is unambiguous, doesn't
depend on a particular compiler version[3], and properly initializes all
subobjects. Do that here so there are no more warnings.
