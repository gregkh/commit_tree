clk: sunxi-ng: sun8i-r: Use local parent references for CLK_HW_INIT_*

With the new clk parenting code and CLK_HW_INIT_* macros, we can
reference parents locally via pointers to struct clk_hw or DT
clock-names.

Convert existing CLK_HW_INIT_* definitions to describe parents using
either struct clk_hw pointers or clock-names from the device tree
binding.

For the AR100, this also allows us to merge the generic AR100 and the
A83T specific one, which only differed in the global clock names for
their parent clocks. The device tree bindings used the same name
specifiers.
