kvm: selftests: ucall improvements

Make sure we complete the I/O after determining we have a ucall,
which is I/O. Also allow the *uc parameter to optionally be NULL.
It's quite possible that a test case will only care about the
return value, like for example when looping on a check for
UCALL_DONE.
