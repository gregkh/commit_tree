HID: quirks: Refactor ELAN 400 and 401 handling

There needs to be coordination between hid-quirks and the elan_i2c driver
about which devices are handled by what drivers.  Currently, both use
whitelists, which results in valid devices being unhandled by default,
when they should not be rejected by hid-quirks.  This is quickly becoming
an issue.

Since elan_i2c has a maintained whitelist of what devices it will handle,
which is now in a header file that hid-quirks can access, use that to
implement a blacklist in hid-quirks so that only the devices that need to
be handled by elan_i2c get rejected by hid-quirks, and everything else is
handled by default.
