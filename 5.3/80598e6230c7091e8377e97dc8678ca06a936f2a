i40e: Check and set the PF driver state first in i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac

The PF driver state flag __I40E_VIRTCHNL_OP_PENDING needs to be
checked and set at the beginning of i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac. Otherwise,
if there are error conditions before it, the flag will be cleared
unexpectedly by this function to cause potential race conditions.
Hence move the check to the top of this function.
