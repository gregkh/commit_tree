powerpc/32s: fix suspend/resume when IBATs 4-7 are used

Previously, only IBAT1 and IBAT2 were used to map kernel linear mem.
Since commit 63b2bc619565 ("powerpc/mm/32s: Use BATs for
STRICT_KERNEL_RWX"), we may have all 8 BATs used for mapping
kernel text. But the suspend/restore functions only save/restore
BATs 0 to 3, and clears BATs 4 to 7.

Make suspend and restore functions respectively save and reload
the 8 BATs on CPUs having MMU_FTR_USE_HIGH_BATS feature.
