habanalabs: Update the device idle check

The patch updates the device idle check:
- Add reading the DMA core status register, because it is possible that
  a QMAN has finished its work but the DMA itself is still running.
- Remove the MME shadow status check, as the MME ARCH status register
  includes the status of all MME shadows.
