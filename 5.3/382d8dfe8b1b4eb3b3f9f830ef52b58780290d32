drm/bridge: sii902x: fix comparision of u32 with less than zero

The less than check for the variable num_lanes is always going to be
false because the variable is a u32.  Fix this by making num_lanes an
int and also make loop index i an int too.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
