clocksource/drivers/exynos_mct: Increase priority over ARM arch timer

Exynos SoCs based on CA7/CA15 have 2 timer interfaces: custom Exynos MCT
(Multi Core Timer) and standard ARM Architected Timers.

There are use cases, where both timer interfaces are used simultanously.
One of such examples is using Exynos MCT for the main system timer and
ARM Architected Timers for the KVM and virtualized guests (KVM requires
arch timers).

Exynos Multi-Core Timer driver (exynos_mct) must be however started
before ARM Architected Timers (arch_timer), because they both share some
common hardware blocks (global system counter) and turning on MCT is
needed to get ARM Architected Timer working properly.

To ensure selecting Exynos MCT as the main system timer, increase MCT
timer rating. To ensure proper starting order of both timers during
suspend/resume cycle, increase MCT hotplug priority over ARM Archictected
Timers.
