qed: Modify api for performing a dmae to another PF

This patch modifies the dmae API to enable performing a dmae operation
to another PF. This enables sharing between the llh entries between PFs
and thus increasing the amount of filters per PF under certain
configurations.
The llh entries require using the dmae since the memory is widebus,
which requires atomicity in access.
