Revert "rt2800: enable TX_PIN_CFG_LNA_PE_ bits per band"

This reverts commit 9ad3b55654455258a9463384edb40077439d879f.

As reported by Sergey:

"I got some problem after upgrade kernel to 5.2 version (debian testing
linux-image-5.2.0-2-amd64). 5Ghz client  stopped to see AP.
Some tests with 1metre distance between client-AP: 2.4Ghz  -22dBm, for
5Ghz - 53dBm !, for longer distance (8m + walls) 2.4 - 61dBm, 5Ghz not
visible."

It was identified that rx signal level degradation was caused by
9ad3b5565445 ("rt2800: enable TX_PIN_CFG_LNA_PE_ bits per band").
So revert this commit.
