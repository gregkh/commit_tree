nvme-pci: limit max_hw_sectors based on the DMA max mapping size

When running a NVMe device that is attached to a addressing
challenged PCIe root port that requires bounce buffering, our
request sizes can easily overflow the swiotlb bounce buffer
size.  Limit the maximum I/O size to the limit exposed by
the DMA mapping subsystem.
