PCI: Skip resource distribution when no hotplug bridges

If "hotplug_bridges == 0", "!dev->is_hotplug_bridge" is always true, so the
loop that divides the remaining resources among hotplug-capable bridges
does nothing.

Check for "hotplug_bridges == 0" earlier, so we don't even have to compute
the amount of remaining resources.  No functional change intended.
