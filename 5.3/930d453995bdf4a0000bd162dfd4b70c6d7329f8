fscrypt: handle blocksize < PAGE_SIZE in fscrypt_zeroout_range()

Adjust fscrypt_zeroout_range() to encrypt a block at a time rather than
a page at a time, so that it works when blocksize < PAGE_SIZE.

This isn't optimized for performance, but then again this function
already wasn't optimized for performance.  As a future optimization, we
could submit much larger bios here.

This is in preparation for allowing encryption on ext4 filesystems with
blocksize != PAGE_SIZE.

This is based on work by Chandan Rajendra.
