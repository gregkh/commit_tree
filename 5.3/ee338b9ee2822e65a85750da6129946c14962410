x86/kexec/64: Prevent kexec from 5-level paging to a 4-level only kernel

If the running kernel has 5-level paging activated, the 5-level paging mode
is preserved across kexec. If the kexec'ed kernel does not contain support
for handling active 5-level paging mode in the decompressor, the
decompressor will crash with #GP.

Prevent this situation at load time. If 5-level paging is active, check the
xloadflags whether the kexec kernel can handle 5-level paging at least in
the decompressor. If not, reject the load attempt and print out an error
message.
