PCI: tegra: Update flow control timer frequency in Tegra210

Recommended UpdateFC threshold in Tegra210 is 0x60 for best performance
of x1 link. Setting this to 0x60 provides the best balance between number
of UpdateFC packets and read data sent over the link.

UpdateFC timer frequency is equal to twice the value of register content
in nsec, i.e (2 * 0x60) = 192 nsec.
