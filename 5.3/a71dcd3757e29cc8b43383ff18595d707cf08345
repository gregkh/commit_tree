reset: remove redundant null check on pointer dev

Pointer dev is being dereferenced when passed to the inlined
functon dev_name, however, dev is later being null checked
so at first this seems like a potential null pointer dereference.

In fact, _reset_control_get_from_lookup is only ever called from
__reset_control_get, right after checking dev->of_node hence
dev can never be null.  Clean this up by removing the redundant
null check.

Thanks to Philipp Zabel for spotting that dev can never be null.
