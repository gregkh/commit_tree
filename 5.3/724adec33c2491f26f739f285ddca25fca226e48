thermal/x86_pkg_temp_thermal: Support multi-die/package

Package temperature sensors are actually implemented in hardware per-die.
Thus, the new multi-die/package systems sport mulitple package thermal
zones for each package.

Update the x86_pkg_temp_thermal to be "multi-die-aware", so it can expose
multiple zones per package, instead of just one.
