drm/amdgpu/gfx10: set SH_MEM_CONFIG.INITIAL_INST_PREFETCH

Prefetch mode 0 is not supported and can lead to hangs with certain very
specific code patterns. Set a sound prefetch mode for all VMIDs rather
than forcing all shaders to set the prefetch mode at the beginning.

Reduce code duplication a bit while we're at it. Note that the 64-bit
address mode enum and the retry all enum are both 0, so the only
functional change is in the INITIAL_INST_PREFETCH field.
