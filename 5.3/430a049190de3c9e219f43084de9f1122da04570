nexthop: Add support for nexthop groups

Allow the creation of nexthop groups which reference other nexthop
objects to create multipath routes:

                      +--------------+
   +------------+   +--------------+ |
   | nh  nh_grp --->| nh_grp_entry |-+
   +------------+   +---------|----+
     ^                |       |    +------------+
     +----------------+       +--->| nh, weight |
        nh_parent                  +------------+

A group entry points to a nexthop with a weight for that hop within the
group. The nexthop has a list_head, grp_list, for tracking which groups
it is a member of and the group entry has a reference back to the parent.
The grp_list is used when a nexthop is deleted - to efficiently remove
it from groups using it.

If a nexthop group spec is given, no other attributes can be set. Each
nexthop id in a group spec must already exist.

Similar to single nexthops, the specification of a nexthop group can be
updated so that data is managed with rcu locking.

Add path selection function to account for multiple paths and add
ipv{4,6}_good_nh helpers to know that if a neighbor entry exists it is
in a good state.

Update NETDEV event handling to rebalance multipath nexthop groups if
a nexthop is deleted due to a link event (down or unregister).

When a nexthop is removed any groups using it are updated. Groups using a
nexthop a tracked via a grp_list.

Nexthop dumps can be limited to groups only by adding NHA_GROUPS to the
request.
