s390/unwind: avoid int overflow in outside_of_stack

When current task is interrupted in-between stack frame allocation
and backchain write instructions new stack frame backchain pointer
is left uninitialized. That invalid backchain value is passed into
outside_of_stack for sanity check. Make sure int overflow does not happen
by subtracting stack_frame size from the stack "end" rather than adding
it to "random" backchain value.
