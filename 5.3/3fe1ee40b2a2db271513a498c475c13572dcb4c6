ARM: use arch_extension directive instead of arch argument

The LLVM Target parser currently does not allow to specify the security
extension as part of -march (see also LLVM Bug 40186 [0]). When trying
to use Clang with LLVM's integrated assembler, this leads to build
errors such as this:
  clang-8: error: the clang compiler does not support '-Wa,-march=armv7-a+sec'

Use ".arch_extension sec" to enable the security extension in a more
portable fasion. Also make sure to use ".arch armv7-a" in case a v6/v7
multi-platform kernel is being built.

Note that this is technically not exactly the same as the old code
checked for availabilty of the security extension by calling as-instr.
However, there are already other sites which use ".arch_extension sec"
unconditionally, hence de-facto we need an assembler capable of
".arch_extension sec" already today (arch/arm/mm/proc-v7.S). The
arch extension "sec" is available since binutils 2.21 according to
its documentation [1].
