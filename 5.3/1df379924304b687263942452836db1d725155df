clk: consoldiate the __clk_get_hw() declarations

Without this we were getting errors like:

In file included from drivers/clk/clkdev.c:22:0:
drivers/clk/clk.h:36:23: error: static declaration of '__clk_get_hw' follows non-static declaration
include/linux/clk-provider.h:808:16: note: previous declaration of '__clk_get_hw' was here

Fixes: 59fcdce425b7 ("clk: Remove ifdef for COMMON_CLK in clk-provider.h")
fixes: 73e0e496afda ("clkdev: Always allocate a struct clk and call __clk_get() w/ CCF")
