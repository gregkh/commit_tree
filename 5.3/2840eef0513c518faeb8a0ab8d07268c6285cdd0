genirq/timings: Fix timings buffer inspection

It appears the index beginning computation is not correct, the current
code does:

     i = (irqts->count & IRQ_TIMINGS_MASK) - 1

If irqts->count is equal to zero, we end up with an index equal to -1,
but that does not happen because the function checks against zero
before and returns in such case.

However, if irqts->count is a multiple of IRQ_TIMINGS_SIZE, the
resulting & bit op will be zero and leads also to a -1 index.

Re-introduce the iteration loop belonging to the previous variance
code which was correct.
