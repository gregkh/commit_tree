mtd: rawnand: micron: handle on-die "ECC-off" devices correctly

Some devices are not supposed to support on-die ECC but experience
shows that internal ECC machinery can actually be enabled through the
"SET FEATURE (EFh)" command, even if a read of the "READ ID Parameter
Tables" returns that it is not.

Currently, the driver checks the "READ ID Parameter" field directly
after having enabled the feature. If the check fails it returns
immediately but leaves the ECC on. When using buggy chips like
MT29F2G08ABAGA and MT29F2G08ABBGA, all future read/program cycles will
go through the on-die ECC, confusing the host controller which is
supposed to be the one handling correction.

To address this in a common way we need to turn off the on-die ECC
directly after reading the "READ ID Parameter" and before checking the
"ECC status".
