ice: Remove redundant and premature event config

In the path for re-enabling FW LLDP engine, there is
a call to register for LLDP MIB change events.  This
call is redundant, in that the call to ice_pf_dcb_cfg
will already register the driver for these events.  Also,
the call as it stands now is too early in the flow before
before DCB is configured.

Remove the redundant call.
