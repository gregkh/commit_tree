Btrfs: fix fsync not persisting dentry deletions due to inode evictions

In order to avoid searches on a log tree when unlinking an inode, we check
if the inode being unlinked was logged in the current transaction, as well
as the inode of its parent directory. When any of the inodes are logged,
we proceed to delete directory items and inode reference items from the
log, to ensure that if a subsequent fsync of only the inode being unlinked
or only of the parent directory when the other is not fsync'ed as well,
does not result in the entry still existing after a power failure.

That check however is not reliable when one of the inodes involved (the
one being unlinked or its parent directory's inode) is evicted, since the
logged_trans field is transient, that is, it is not stored on disk, so it
is lost when the inode is evicted and loaded into memory again (which is
set to zero on load). As a consequence the checks currently being done by
btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log() and btrfs_del_inode_ref_in_log() always
return true if the inode was evicted before, regardless of the inode
having been logged or not before (and in the current transaction), this
results in the dentry being unlinked still existing after a log replay
if after the unlink operation only one of the inodes involved is fsync'ed.

Example:

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
  $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt

  $ mkdir /mnt/dir
  $ touch /mnt/dir/foo
  $ xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/dir/foo

  # Keep an open file descriptor on our directory while we evict inodes.
  # We just want to evict the file's inode, the directory's inode must not
  # be evicted.
  $ ( cd /mnt/dir; while true; do :; done ) &
  $ pid=$!

  # Wait a bit to give time to background process to chdir to our test
  # directory.
  $ sleep 0.5

  # Trigger eviction of the file's inode.
  $ echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

  # Unlink our file and fsync the parent directory. After a power failure
  # we don't expect to see the file anymore, since we fsync'ed the parent
  # directory.
  $ rm -f $SCRATCH_MNT/dir/foo
  $ xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/dir

  <power failure>

  $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
  $ ls /mnt/dir
  foo
  $
   --> file still there, unlink not persisted despite explicit fsync on dir

Fix this by checking if the inode has the full_sync bit set in its runtime
flags as well, since that bit is set everytime an inode is loaded from
disk, or for other less common cases such as after a shrinking truncate
or failure to allocate extent maps for holes, and gets cleared after the
first fsync. Also consider the inode as possibly logged only if it was
last modified in the current transaction (besides having the full_fsync
flag set).
