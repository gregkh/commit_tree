mm/sparse.c: set section nid for hot-add memory

In case of NODE_NOT_IN_PAGE_FLAGS is set, we store section's node id in
section_to_node_table[].  While for hot-add memory, this is missed.
Without this information, page_to_nid() may not give the right node id.

BTW, current online_pages works because it leverages nid in
memory_block.  But the granularity of node id should be mem_section
wide.
