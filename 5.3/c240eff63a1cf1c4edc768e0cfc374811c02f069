bpf: introduce new bpf prog load flags "BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32"

x86_64 and AArch64 perhaps are two arches that running bpf testsuite
frequently, however the zero extension insertion pass is not enabled for
them because of their hardware support.

It is critical to guarantee the pass correction as it is supposed to be
enabled at default for a couple of other arches, for example PowerPC,
SPARC, arm, NFP etc. Therefore, it would be very useful if there is a way
to test this pass on for example x86_64.

The test methodology employed by this set is "poisoning" useless bits. High
32-bit of a definition is randomized if it is identified as not used by any
later insn. Such randomization is only enabled under testing mode which is
gated by the new bpf prog load flags "BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32".
