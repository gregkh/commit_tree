Revert "Bluetooth: validate BLE connection interval updates"

This reverts commit c49a8682fc5d298d44e8d911f4fa14690ea9485e.

There are devices which require low connection intervals for usable operation
including keyboards and mice. Forcing a static connection interval for
these types of devices has an impact in latency and causes a regression.
