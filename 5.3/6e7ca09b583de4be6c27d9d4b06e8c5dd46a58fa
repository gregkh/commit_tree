btrfs: Fix deadlock caused by missing memory barrier

Commit 06297d8cefca ("btrfs: switch extent_buffer blocking_writers from
atomic to int") changed the type of blocking_writers but forgot to
adjust relevant code in btrfs_tree_unlock by converting the
smp_mb__after_atomic to smp_mb.  This opened up the possibility of a
deadlock due to re-ordering of setting blocking_writers and
checking/waking up the waiter. This particular lockup is explained in a
comment above waitqueue_active() function.

Fix it by converting the memory barrier to a full smp_mb, accounting
for the fact that blocking_writers is a simple integer.
