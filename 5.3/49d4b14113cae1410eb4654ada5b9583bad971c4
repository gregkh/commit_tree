Revert "r8152: napi hangup fix after disconnect"

This reverts commit 0ee1f4734967af8321ecebaf9c74221ace34f2d5.

The commit 0ee1f4734967 ("r8152: napi hangup fix after
disconnect") adds a check about RTL8152_UNPLUG to determine
if calling napi_disable() is invalid in rtl8152_close(),
when rtl8152_disconnect() is called. This avoids to use
napi_disable() after calling netif_napi_del().

Howver, commit ffa9fec30ca0 ("r8152: set RTL8152_UNPLUG
only for real disconnection") causes that RTL8152_UNPLUG
is not always set when calling rtl8152_disconnect().
Therefore, I have to revert commit 0ee1f4734967 ("r8152:
napi hangup fix after disconnect"), first. And submit
another patch to fix it.
