clk: imx6q: Switch to clk_hw based API

Switch the entire clk-imx6q driver to clk_hw based API.
Add imx6q_obtain_fixed_clk_hw helper to clean up the registration
of the clocks that are either found in device tree or are assigned
a fixed zero rate. This switch allows us to move closer to a clear
split between consumer and provider clk APIs.
