w1: ds2413: when the slave is not responding during read, select it again

The protocol is not allowing to obtain a byte of 0xff for PIO_ACCESS_READ
call. It is very likely that the slave was not addressed properly and
it is just not respoding (leaving the bus in logic high state) during
the read of sampled PIO value.
We cannot just call w1_reset_resume_command() because the problem will
persist, instead try selecting (addressing) the slave again.
