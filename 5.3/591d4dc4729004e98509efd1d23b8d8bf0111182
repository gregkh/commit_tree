drm/i915: make REG_BIT() and REG_GENMASK() work with variables

REG_BIT() and REG_GENMASK() were intended to work with both constant
expressions and otherwise, with the former having extra compile time
checks for the bit ranges. Incredibly, the result of
__builtin_constant_p() is not an integer constant expression when given
a non-constant expression, leading to errors in BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO().

Replace __builtin_constant_p() with the __is_constexpr() magic spell.
