perf intel-pt: Accumulate cycle count from TSC/TMA/MTC packets

When CYC packets are not available, it is still possible to count cycles
using TSC/TMA/MTC timestamps.

As the timestamp increments in TSC ticks, convert to CPU cycles using
the current core-to-bus ratio.

Do not accumulate cycles when control flow packet generation is not
enabled, nor when time has been "lost", typically due to mwait, which is
indicated by a TSC/TMA packet that is not part of PSB+.
