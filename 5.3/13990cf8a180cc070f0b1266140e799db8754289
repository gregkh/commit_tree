ide: use BIT() macro for defining bit-flags

The BIT() macro is available for defining the required bit-flags.

Since it operates on an unsigned value and expands to an unsigned result,
using it, instead of an expression like (1 << x), also fixes the problem
of shifting a signed 32-bit value by 31 bits (e.g. 1 << 31).
