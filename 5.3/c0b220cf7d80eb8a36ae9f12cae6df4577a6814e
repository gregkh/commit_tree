ipv6: Refactor exception functions

Before moving exception bucket from fib6_info to fib6_nh, refactor
rt6_flush_exceptions, rt6_remove_exception_rt, rt6_mtu_change_route,
and rt6_update_exception_stamp_rt. In all 3 cases, move the primary
logic into a new helper that starts with fib6_nh_. The latter 3
functions still take a fib6_info; this will be changed to fib6_nh
in the next patch.

In the case of rt6_mtu_change_route, move the fib6_metric_locked
out as a standalone check - no need to call the new function if
the fib entry has the mtu locked. Also, add fib6_info to
rt6_mtu_change_arg as a way of passing the fib entry to the new
helper.

No functional change intended. The goal here is to make the next
patch easier to review by moving existing lookup logic for each to
new helpers.
