staging: kpc2000: kpc_i2c: fail probe if unable to get I/O resource

The kpc_i2c driver attempts to map its I/O space without verifying
whether or not the result of platform_get_resource() is NULL. Make the
driver check that platform_get_resource did not return NULL before
attempting to use the value returned to map an I/O space.
