media: omap3isp: Don't rely on devm for memory resource management

devm functions are fine for managing resources that are directly related
to the device at hand and that have no other dependencies. However, a
process holding a file handle to a device created by a driver for a device
may result in the file handle left behind after the device is long gone.
This will result in accessing released (and potentially reallocated)
memory.

Instead, manage the memory resources in the driver. Releasing the
resources can be later on bound to e.g. by releasing a reference.
