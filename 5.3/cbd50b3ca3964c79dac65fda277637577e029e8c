PCI: mobiveil: Fix devfn check in mobiveil_pcie_valid_device()

Current check for devfn number in mobiveil_pci_valid_device() is
wrong in that it flags as invalid functions present in PCI device 0
in the root bus while it is perfectly valid to access all functions
in PCI device 0 in the root bus.

Update the check in mobiveil_pci_valid_device() to fix the issue.
