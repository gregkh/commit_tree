drm/i915/icl: Ensure port A combo PHY HW state is correct

Make sure the HW state of the port A combo PHY is correct wrt. the
IREFGEN setting. This will force a reprogramming during init or a WARN
during uninit if the setting is incorrect.

On my ICL RVP I haven't seen this check failing and leading to a forced
reinit/WARN, but let's add it still for consistency.
