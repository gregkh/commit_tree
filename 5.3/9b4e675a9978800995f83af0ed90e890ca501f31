btrfs: detect fast implementation of crc32c on all architectures

Currently, there's only check for fast crc32c implementation on X86,
based on the CPU flags. This is used to decide if checksumming should be
offloaded to worker threads or can be calculated by the caller.

As there are more architectures that implement a faster version of
crc32c (ARM, SPARC, s390, MIPS, PowerPC), also there are specialized hw
cards.

The detection is based on driver name, all generic C implementations
contain 'generic', while the specialized versions do not. Alternatively
the priority could be used, but this is not currently provided by the
crypto API.

The flag is set per-filesystem at mount time and used for the offloading
decisions.
