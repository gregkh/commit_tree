drm/amd/display: move back vbios cmd table for set dprefclk

[Why]
Upon closer inspection, our previous implementation is missing
code for programming de-spread and DP DTO. Porting this logic
into driver is rather involved, as there are a lot of table
look ups. So for now move back to calling vbios cmd table

[How]
Go back to calling vbios cmd table for set dp_refclk
