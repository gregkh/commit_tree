init/Kconfig: fix neighboring typos

This fixes a couple typos I noticed in the slab Kconfig:

	sacrifies -> sacrifices
	accellerate -> accelerate

Seeing as no other instances of these typos are found elsewhere in the
kernel and that I originally added one of the two, I can only assume
working on slab must have caused damage to the spelling centers of my
brain.
