bcache: avoid flushing btree node in cache_set_flush() if io disabled

When cache_set_flush() is called for too many I/O errors detected on
cache device and the cache set is retiring, inside the function it
doesn't make sense to flushing cached btree nodes from c->btree_cache
because CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE is set on c->flags already and all I/Os
onto cache device will be rejected.

This patch checks in cache_set_flush() that whether CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE
is set. If yes, then avoids to flush the cached btree nodes to reduce
more time and make cache set retiring more faster.
