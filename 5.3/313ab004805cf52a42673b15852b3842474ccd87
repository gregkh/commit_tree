net/tls: remove sock unlock/lock around strp_done()

The tls close() callback currently drops the sock lock to call
strp_done(). Split up the RX cleanup into stopping the strparser
and releasing most resources, syncing strparser and finally
freeing the context.

To avoid the need for a strp_done() call on the cleanup path
of device offload make sure we don't arm the strparser until
we are sure init will be successful.
