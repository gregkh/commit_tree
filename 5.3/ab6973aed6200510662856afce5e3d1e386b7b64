e1000e: Reduce boot time by tightening sleep ranges

The e1000e driver is a great user of the usleep_range() API,
and has nice ranges that in principle help power management.

However the ranges that are used only during system startup are
very long (and can add easily 100 msec to the boot time) while
the power savings of such long ranges is irrelevant due to the
one-off, boot only, nature of these functions.

This patch shrinks some of the longest ranges to be shorter
(while still using a power friendly 1 msec range); this saves
100msec+ of boot time on my BDW NUCs
