block: sed-opal: add ioctl for done-mark of shadow mbr

Enable users to mark the shadow mbr as done without completely
deactivating the shadow mbr feature. This may be useful on reboots,
when the power to the disk is not disconnected in between and the shadow
mbr stores the required boot files. Of course, this saves also the
(few) commands required to enable the feature if it is already enabled
and one only wants to mark the shadow mbr as done.
