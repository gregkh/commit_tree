selinux: provide __le variables explicitly

While the endiannes is being handled properly sparse was unable to verify
this due to type inconsistency. So introduce an additional __le32
respectively _le64 variable to be passed to le32/64_to_cpu() to allow
sparse to verify proper typing. Note that this patch does not change
the generated binary on little-endian systems - on 32bit powerpc it
does change the binary.
