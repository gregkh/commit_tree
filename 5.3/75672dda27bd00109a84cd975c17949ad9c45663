bpf: fix BPF_ALU32 | BPF_ARSH on BE arches

Yauheni reported the following code do not work correctly on BE arches:

       ALU_ARSH_X:
               DST = (u64) (u32) ((*(s32 *) &DST) >> SRC);
               CONT;
       ALU_ARSH_K:
               DST = (u64) (u32) ((*(s32 *) &DST) >> IMM);
               CONT;

and are causing failure of test_verifier test 'arsh32 on imm 2' on BE
arches.

The code is taking address and interpreting memory directly, so is not
endianness neutral. We should instead perform standard C type casting on
the variable. A u64 to s32 conversion will drop the high 32-bit and reserve
the low 32-bit as signed integer, this is all we want.
