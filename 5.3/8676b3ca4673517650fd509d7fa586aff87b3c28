soundwire: fix regmap dependencies and align with other serial links

The existing code has a mixed select/depend usage which makes no sense.

config SOUNDWIRE_BUS
       tristate
       select REGMAP_SOUNDWIRE

config REGMAP_SOUNDWIRE
        tristate
        depends on SOUNDWIRE_BUS

Let's remove one layer of Kconfig definitions and align with the
solutions used by all other serial links.
