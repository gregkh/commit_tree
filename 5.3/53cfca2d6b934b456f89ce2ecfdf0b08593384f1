net: phy: Add phy_sysfs_create_links helper function

This is a cosmetic patch that wraps the operation of creating sysfs
links between the netdev->phydev and the phydev->attached_dev.

This is needed to keep the indentation level in check in a follow-up
patch where this function will be guarded against the existence of a
phydev->attached_dev.
