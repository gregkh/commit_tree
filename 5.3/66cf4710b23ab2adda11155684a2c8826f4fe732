ibmveth: Convert multicast list size for little-endian system

The ibm,mac-address-filters property defines the maximum number of
addresses the hypervisor's multicast filter list can support. It is
encoded as a big-endian integer in the OF device tree, but the virtual
ethernet driver does not convert it for use by little-endian systems.
As a result, the driver is not behaving as it should on affected systems
when a large number of multicast addresses are assigned to the device.
