signal/pid_namespace: Fix reboot_pid_ns to use send_sig not force_sig

The locking in force_sig_info is not prepared to deal with a task that
exits or execs (as sighand may change).  The is not a locking problem
in force_sig as force_sig is only built to handle synchronous
exceptions.

Further the function force_sig_info changes the signal state if the
signal is ignored, or blocked or if SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE will prevent the
delivery of the signal.  The signal SIGKILL can not be ignored and can
not be blocked and SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE won't prevent it from being
delivered.

So using force_sig rather than send_sig for SIGKILL is confusing
and pointless.

Because it won't impact the sending of the signal and and because
using force_sig is wrong, replace force_sig with send_sig.
