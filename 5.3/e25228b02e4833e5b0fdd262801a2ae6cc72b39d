drm/amd/display: Increase Backlight Gain Step Size

[Why]
Some backlight tests fail due to backlight settling
taking too long. This happens because the step
size used to change backlight levels is too small.

[How]
1. Change the size of the backlight gain step size
2. Change how DMCU firmware gets the step size value
   so that it is passed in by driver during DMCU initn
