soc: qcom: fix QCOM_AOSS_QMP dependency and build errors

Fix Kconfig warning and subsequent build errors that are caused
when PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS=y but CONFIG_PM is not set/enabled.

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS
  Depends on [n]: PM [=n]
  Selected by [m]:
  - QCOM_AOSS_QMP [=m] && (ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST [=y]) && MAILBOX [=y] && COMMON_CLK [=y]
