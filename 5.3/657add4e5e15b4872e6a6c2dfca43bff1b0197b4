scsi: lpfc: Fix poor use of hardware queues if fewer irq vectors

While fixing the resources per socket, realized the driver was not using
hardware queues (up to 1 per cpu) if there were fewer interrupt
vectors. The driver was only using the hardware queue assigned to the cpu
with the vector.

Rework the affinity map check to use the additional hardware queue elements
that had been allocated.  If the cpu count exceeds the hardware queue count
- share, but choose what is shared with by: hyperthread peer, core peer,
socket peer, or finally similar cpu in a different socket.
