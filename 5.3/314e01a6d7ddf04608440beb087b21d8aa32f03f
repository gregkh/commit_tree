xfs: fall back to native ioctls for unhandled compat ones

Always try the native ioctl if we don't have a compat handler.  This
removes a lot of boilerplate code as 'modern' ioctls should generally
be compat clean, and fixes the missing entries for the recently added
FS_IOC_GETFSLABEL/FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL ioctls.
