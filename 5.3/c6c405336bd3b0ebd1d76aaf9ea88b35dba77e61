vmcore: add a kernel parameter novmcoredd

Since commit 2724273e8fd0 ("vmcore: add API to collect hardware dump in
second kernel"), drivers are allowed to add device related dump data to
vmcore as they want by using the device dump API.  This has a potential
issue, the data is stored in memory, drivers may append too much data
and use too much memory.  The vmcore is typically used in a kdump kernel
which runs in a pre-reserved small chunk of memory.  So as a result it
will make kdump unusable at all due to OOM issues.

So introduce new 'novmcoredd' command line option.  User can disable
device dump to reduce memory usage.  This is helpful if device dump is
using too much memory, disabling device dump could make sure a regular
vmcore without device dump data is still available.
