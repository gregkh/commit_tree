parisc: fix compilation errrors

Commit 0cfaee2af3a0 ("include/asm-generic/5level-fixup.h: fix variable
'p4d' set but not used") converted a few functions from macros to static
inline, which causes parisc to complain,

  In file included from include/asm-generic/4level-fixup.h:38:0,
                   from arch/parisc/include/asm/pgtable.h:5,
                   from arch/parisc/include/asm/io.h:6,
                   from include/linux/io.h:13,
                   from sound/core/memory.c:9:
  include/asm-generic/5level-fixup.h:14:18: error: unknown type name 'pgd_t'; did you mean 'pid_t'?
   #define p4d_t    pgd_t
                    ^
  include/asm-generic/5level-fixup.h:24:28: note: in expansion of macro 'p4d_t'
   static inline int p4d_none(p4d_t p4d)
                              ^~~~~

It is because "4level-fixup.h" is included before "asm/page.h" where
"pgd_t" is defined.
