mmc: host: s3cmci: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

Also, because there is no need to save the file dentries, remove them
from the host-specific structure and just recursively delete the
directory that the driver created, when shutting down.
