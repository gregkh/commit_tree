backing-dev: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

And as the return value does not matter at all, no need to save the
dentry in struct backing_dev_info, so delete it.
