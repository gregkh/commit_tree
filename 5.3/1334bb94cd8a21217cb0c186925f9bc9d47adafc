perf scripts python: export-to-sqlite.py: Fix DROP VIEW power_events_view

Drop power_events_view before its dependent tables.

SQLite does not seem to mind but the fix was needed for PostgreSQL
(export-to-postgresql.py script), so do the same fix for the SQLite. It is
more logical and keeps the 2 scripts following the same approach.
