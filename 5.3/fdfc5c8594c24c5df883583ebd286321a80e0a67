tcp: remove empty skb from write queue in error cases

Vladimir Rutsky reported stuck TCP sessions after memory pressure
events. Edge Trigger epoll() user would never receive an EPOLLOUT
notification allowing them to retry a sendmsg().

Jason tested the case of sk_stream_alloc_skb() returning NULL,
but there are other paths that could lead both sendmsg() and sendpage()
to return -1 (EAGAIN), with an empty skb queued on the write queue.

This patch makes sure we remove this empty skb so that
Jason code can detect that the queue is empty, and
call sk->sk_write_space(sk) accordingly.

Fixes: ce5ec440994b ("tcp: ensure epoll edge trigger wakeup when write queue is empty")
