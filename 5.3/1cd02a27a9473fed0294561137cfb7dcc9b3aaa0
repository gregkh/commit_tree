LSM: SafeSetID: refactor policy hash table

parent_kuid and child_kuid are kuids, there is no reason to make them
uint64_t. (And anyway, in the kernel, the normal name for that would be
u64, not uint64_t.)

check_setuid_policy_hashtable_key() and
check_setuid_policy_hashtable_key_value() are basically the same thing,
merge them.

Also fix the comment that claimed that (1<<8)==128.
