arm64: vdso: Fix Makefile regression

Using an old .config in combination with "make oldconfig" can cause
an incorrect detection of the compat compiler:

$ grep CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT .config
CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO=""

$ make oldconfig && make
arch/arm64/Makefile:58: gcc not found, check CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT.
Stop.

Accordingly to the section 7.2 of the GNU Make manual "Syntax of
Conditionals", "When the value results from complex expansions of
variables and functions, expansions you would consider empty may
actually contain whitespace characters and thus are not seen as
empty. However, you can use the strip function to avoid interpreting
whitespace as a non-empty value."

Fix the issue adding strip to the CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT string
evaluation.
