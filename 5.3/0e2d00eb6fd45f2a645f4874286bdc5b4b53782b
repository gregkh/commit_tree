RDMA: Add NLDEV_GET_CHARDEV to allow char dev discovery and autoload

Allow userspace to issue a netlink query against the ib_device for
something like "uverbs" and get back the char dev name, inode major/minor,
and interface ABI information for "uverbs0".

Since we are now in netlink this can also trigger a module autoload to
make the uverbs device come into existence.

Largely this will let us replace searching and reading inside sysfs to
setup devices, and provides an alternative (using driver_id) to device
name based provider binding for things like rxe.
