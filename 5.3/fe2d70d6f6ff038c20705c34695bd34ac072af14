fbcon: Call con2fb_map functions directly

These are actually fbcon ioctls which just happen to be exposed
through /dev/fb*. They completely ignore which fb_info they're called
on, and I think the userspace tool even hardcodes to /dev/fb0.

Hence just forward the entire thing to fbcon.c wholesale.

Note that this patch drops the fb_lock/unlock on the set side. Since
the ioctl can operate on any fb (as passed in through
con2fb.framebuffer) this is bogus. Also note that fbcon.c in general
never calls fb_lock on anything, so this has been badly broken
already.

With this the last user of the fbcon notifier callback is gone, and we
can garbage collect that too.

v2: add missing uaccess.h include (alpha fails to compile otherwise),
reported by kbuild.

v3: Remember to also drop the #defines (Maarten)

v4: Add the static inline to dummy functions.
