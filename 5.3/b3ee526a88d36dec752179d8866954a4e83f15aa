net: dsa: sja1105: Use correct dsa_8021q VIDs for FDB commands

A FDB entry means that "frames that match this VID and DMAC must be
forwarded to this port".

In the case of dsa_8021q however, the VID is not a single one (and
neither two, as my previous patch assumed). The VID can be set either by
the CPU port (1 tx_vid), or by any of the other front-panel port (n-1
rx_vid's).
