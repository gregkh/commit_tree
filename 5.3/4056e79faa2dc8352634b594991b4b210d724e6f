ABI: sysfs-driver-mlxreg-io: fix the what fields

The author of this file should be given an award for creativity:
the What: fields on this file technically fulfills the description
at README. Yet, the way it is, it can't be parsed on a script,
and if someone would try to do something like:

	grep hwmon*/jtag_enable

It wouldn't find anything.

Fix the What fields in a way that it can be parseable by a
script and other search tools.
