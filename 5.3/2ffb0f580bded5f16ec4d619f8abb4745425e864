ASoC: soc-core: WARN() is not related to component->driver->probe

soc_probe_component() has WARN() under if (component->driver->probe),
but, this WARN() check is not related to .probe callback.
So, it should be called at (B) instead of (A).
This patch moves it out of if().

	if (component->driver->probe) {
		ret = component->driver->probe(component);
		...
(A)		WARN(...)
	}
(B)	WARN(...)
