scsi: fcoe: Embed fc_rport_priv in fcoe_rport structure

Gcc-9 complains for a memset across pointer boundaries, which happens as
the code tries to allocate a flexible array on the stack.  Turns out we
cannot do this without relying on gcc-isms, so with this patch we'll embed
the fc_rport_priv structure into fcoe_rport, can use the normal
'container_of' outcast, and will only have to do a memset over one
structure.
