iommu: Add API to request DMA domain for device

Normally during iommu probing a device, a default doamin will
be allocated and attached to the device. The domain type of
the default domain is statically defined, which results in a
situation where the allocated default domain isn't suitable
for the device due to some limitations. We already have API
iommu_request_dm_for_dev() to replace a DMA domain with an
identity one. This adds iommu_request_dma_domain_for_dev()
to request a dma domain if an allocated identity domain isn't
suitable for the device in question.
