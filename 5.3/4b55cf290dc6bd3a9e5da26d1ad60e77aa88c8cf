devmap: Rename ifindex member in bpf_redirect_info

The bpf_redirect_info struct has an 'ifindex' member which was named back
when the redirects could only target egress interfaces. Now that we can
also redirect to sockets and CPUs, this is a bit misleading, so rename the
member to tgt_index.

Reorder the struct members so we can have 'tgt_index' and 'tgt_value' next
to each other in a subsequent patch.
