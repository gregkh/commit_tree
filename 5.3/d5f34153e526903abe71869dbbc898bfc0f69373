debugobjects: Move printk out of db->lock critical sections

The db->lock is a raw spinlock and so the lock hold time is supposed
to be short. This will not be the case when printk() is being involved
in some of the critical sections. In order to avoid the long hold time,
in case some messages need to be printed, the debug_object_is_on_stack()
and debug_print_object() calls are now moved out of those critical
sections.
