tracepoint: Use struct_size() in kmalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct tp_probes {
	...
        struct tracepoint_func probes[0];
};

instance = kmalloc(sizeof(sizeof(struct tp_probes) +
			sizeof(struct tracepoint_func) * count, GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = kmalloc(struct_size(instance, probes, count) GFP_KERNEL);

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
