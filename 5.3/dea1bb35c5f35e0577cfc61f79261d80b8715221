NFS: Fix regression whereby fscache errors are appearing on 'nofsc' mounts

People are reporing seeing fscache errors being reported concerning
duplicate cookies even in cases where they are not setting up fscache
at all. The rule needs to be that if fscache is not enabled, then it
should have no side effects at all.

To ensure this is the case, we disable fscache completely on all superblocks
for which the 'fsc' mount option was not set. In order to avoid issues
with '-oremount', we also disable the ability to turn fscache on via
remount.
