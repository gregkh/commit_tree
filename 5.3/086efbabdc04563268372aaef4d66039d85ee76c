staging: vchiq: revert "switch to wait_for_completion_killable"

The killable version of wait_for_completion() is meant to be used on
situations where it should not fail at all costs, but still have the
convenience of being able to kill it if really necessary. VCHIQ doesn't
fit this criteria, as it's mainly used as an interface to V4L2 and ALSA
devices.
