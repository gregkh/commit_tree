platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Report switch events when event wakes device

When a switch event, such as tablet mode/laptop mode or docked/undocked,
wakes a device make sure that the value of the swich is reported.
Without when a device is put in tablet mode from laptop mode when it is
suspended or vice versa the device will wake up but mode will be
incorrect.

Tested by suspending a device in laptop mode and putting it in tablet
mode, the device resumes and is in tablet mode. When suspending the
device in tablet mode and putting it in laptop mode the device resumes
and is in laptop mode.
