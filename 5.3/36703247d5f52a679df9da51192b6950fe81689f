io_uring: ensure ->list is initialized for poll commands

Daniel reports that when testing an http server that uses io_uring
to poll for incoming connections, sometimes it hard crashes. This is
due to an uninitialized list member for the io_uring request. Normally
this doesn't trigger and none of the test cases caught it.
