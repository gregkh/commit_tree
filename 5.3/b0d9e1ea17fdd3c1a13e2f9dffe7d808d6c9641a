btrfs: Reduce critical section in btrfs_init_dev_replace_tgtdev

There is no point in holding btrfs_fs_devices::device_list_mutex
while initialising fields of the not-yet-published device. Instead,
hold the mutex only when the newly initialised device is being
published. I think holding device_list_mutex here is redundant
altogether, because at this point BTRFS_FS_EXCL_OP is set which
prevents device removal/addition/balance/resize to occur.
