usb: gadget: Zero ffs_io_data

In some cases the "Allocate & copy" block in ffs_epfile_io() is not
executed. Consequently, in such a case ffs_alloc_buffer() is never called
and struct ffs_io_data is not initialized properly. This in turn leads to
problems when ffs_free_buffer() is called at the end of ffs_epfile_io().

This patch uses kzalloc() instead of kmalloc() in the aio case and memset()
in non-aio case to properly initialize struct ffs_io_data.
