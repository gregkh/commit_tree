drm/amdkfd: avoid HMM change cause circular lock

There is circular lock between gfx and kfd path with HMM change:
lock(dqm) -> bo::reserve -> amdgpu_mn_lock

To avoid this, move init/unint_mqd() out of lock(dqm), to remove nested
locking between mmap_sem and bo::reserve. The locking order
is: bo::reserve -> amdgpu_mn_lock(p->mn)
