RDMA/efa: Be consistent with success flow return value

The EFA driver is written with success oriented flows in mind, meaning
that functions should mostly end with a return 0 statement.
Error flows return their error value on their own instead of assuming
that the function will return the error at the end.

This commit fixes a bunch of functions that were not aligned with this
behavior.
