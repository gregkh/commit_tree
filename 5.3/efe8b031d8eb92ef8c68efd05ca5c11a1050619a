media: stv090x: fix double free on state object

There two callers of stv090x_setup_compound manage the allocation and
freeing if state there is an error condition from stv090x_setup_compound.
Currently function stv090x_setup_compound also frees the state object
too, leading to a double free in the callers of this function.  Fix
this by removing the extraneous free in stv090x_setup_compound and just
leave the callers handle the allocation/free'ing.
