kconfig: Clear "written" flag to avoid data loss

Prior to this commit, starting nconfig, xconfig or gconfig, and saving
the .config file more than once caused data loss, where a .config file
that contained only comments would be written to disk starting from the
second save operation.

This bug manifests itself because the SYMBOL_WRITTEN flag is never
cleared after the first call to conf_write, and subsequent calls to
conf_write then skip all of the configuration symbols due to the
SYMBOL_WRITTEN flag being set.

This commit resolves this issue by clearing the SYMBOL_WRITTEN flag
from all symbols before conf_write returns.
