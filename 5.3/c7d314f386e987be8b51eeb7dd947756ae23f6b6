x86/MCE: Make the number of MCA banks a per-CPU variable

The number of MCA banks is provided per logical CPU. Historically, this
number has been the same across all CPUs, but this is not an
architectural guarantee. Future AMD systems may have MCA bank counts
that vary between logical CPUs in a system.

This issue was partially addressed in

  006c077041dc ("x86/mce: Handle varying MCA bank counts")

by allocating structures using the maximum number of MCA banks and by
saving the maximum MCA bank count in a system as the global count. This
means that some extra structures are allocated. Also, this means that
CPUs will spend more time in the #MC and other handlers checking extra
MCA banks.

Thus, define the number of MCA banks as a per-CPU variable.
