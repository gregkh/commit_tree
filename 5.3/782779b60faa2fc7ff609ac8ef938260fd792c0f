tpm: Actually fail on TPM errors during "get random"

A "get random" may fail with a TPM error, but those codes were returned
as-is to the caller, which assumed the result was the number of bytes
that had been written to the target buffer, which could lead to a kernel
heap memory exposure and over-read.

This fixes tpm1_get_random() to mask positive TPM errors into -EIO, as
before.

[   18.092103] tpm tpm0: A TPM error (379) occurred attempting get random
[   18.092106] usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object 'kmalloc-64' (offset 0, size 379)!
