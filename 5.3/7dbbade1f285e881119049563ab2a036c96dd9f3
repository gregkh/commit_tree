proc: test /proc/sysvipc vs setns(CLONE_NEWIPC)

I thought that /proc/sysvipc has the same bug as /proc/net

	commit 1fde6f21d90f8ba5da3cb9c54ca991ed72696c43
	proc: fix /proc/net/* after setns(2)

However, it doesn't! /proc/sysvipc files do

	get_ipc_ns(current->nsproxy->ipc_ns);

in their open() hook and avoid the problem.

Keep the test, maybe /proc/sysvipc will become broken someday :-\
