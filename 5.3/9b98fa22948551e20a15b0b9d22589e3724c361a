mm: stub out all of swapops.h for !CONFIG_MMU

The whole header file deals with swap entries and PTEs, none of which
can exist for nommu builds.  The current nommu ports have lots of stubs
to allow the inline functions in swapops.h to compile, but as none of
this functionality is actually used there is no point in even providing
it.  This way we don't have to provide the stubs for the upcoming RISC-V
nommu port, and can eventually remove it from the existing ports.
