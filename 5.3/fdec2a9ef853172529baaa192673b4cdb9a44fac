KVM: arm64: Migrate _elx sysreg accessors to msr_s/mrs_s

Currently, the {read,write}_sysreg_el*() accessors for accessing
particular ELs' sysregs in the presence of VHE rely on some local
hacks and define their system register encodings in a way that is
inconsistent with the core definitions in <asm/sysreg.h>.

As a result, it is necessary to add duplicate definitions for any
system register that already needs a definition in sysreg.h for
other reasons.

This is a bit of a maintenance headache, and the reasons for the
_el*() accessors working the way they do is a bit historical.

This patch gets rid of the shadow sysreg definitions in
<asm/kvm_hyp.h>, converts the _el*() accessors to use the core
__msr_s/__mrs_s interface, and converts all call sites to use the
standard sysreg #define names (i.e., upper case, with SYS_ prefix).

This patch will conflict heavily anyway, so the opportunity
to clean up some bad whitespace in the context of the changes is
taken.

The change exposes a few system registers that have no sysreg.h
definition, due to msr_s/mrs_s being used in place of msr/mrs:
additions are made in order to fill in the gaps.
