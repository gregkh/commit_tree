arm64: dts: msm8996: Add proper capacity scaling for the cpus

msm8996 features 4 cpus - 2 in each cluster. However, all cpus implement
the same microarchitecture and the two clusters only differ in the
maximum frequency attainable by the CPUs.

Add capacity-dmips-mhz property to allow the topology code to determine
the actual capacity by taking into account the highest frequency for
each CPU.
