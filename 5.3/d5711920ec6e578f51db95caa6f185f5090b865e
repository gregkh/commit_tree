Revert "NFSv4/flexfiles: Abort I/O early if the layout segment was invalidated"

This reverts commit a79f194aa4879e9baad118c3f8bb2ca24dbef765.
The mechanism for aborting I/O is racy, since we are not guaranteed that
the request is asleep while we're changing both task->tk_status and
task->tk_action.
