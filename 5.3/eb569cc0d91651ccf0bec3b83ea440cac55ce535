staging: rtl8723bs: core: Replace function Set_MSR()

Remove function Set_NETYPE0_MSR as it only has one line and it is only
called by one other function, Set_MSR.
Replace contents of Set_MSR with the contents of Set_NETYPE0_MSR as
Set_MSR does nothing except call Set_NETYPE0_MSR.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
