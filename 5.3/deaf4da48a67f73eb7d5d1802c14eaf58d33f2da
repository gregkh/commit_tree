perf augmented_raw_syscalls: Change helper to consider just the augmented_filename part

So that we can use it for multiple args, baby steps not to step into the
verifier toes.

In the process make sure we handle -EFAULT from bpf_prog_read_str(), as
this really is needed now that we'll handle more than one augmented
argument, i.e. if there is failure, then we have the argument that fails
have:

  (size = 0, err = -EFAULT, value = [] )

followed by the next, lets say that worked for a second pathname:

  (size = 4, err = 0, value = "/tmp" )

So we can skip the first while telling the user about the problem and
then process the second.
