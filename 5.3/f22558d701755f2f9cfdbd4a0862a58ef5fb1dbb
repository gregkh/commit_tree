dt-bindings: olpc,xo1.75-ec: Add OLPC XO-1.75 EC bindings

The OLPC XO-1.75 Embedded Controller is a SPI master that uses extra
signals for handshaking. It needs to know when is the slave (Linux)
side's TX FIFO ready for transfer (the ready-gpio signal on the SPI
controller node) and when does it wish to respond with a command (the
cmd-gpio property).
