btrfs: fix memory leak of path on error return path

Currently if the allocation of roots or tmp_ulist fails the error handling
does not free up the allocation of path causing a memory leak. Fix this and
other similar leaks by moving the call of btrfs_free_path from label out
to label out_free_ulist.

Kudos to David Sterba for spotting the issue in my original fix and suggesting
the correct way to fix the leak and Anand Jain for spotting a double free
issue.
