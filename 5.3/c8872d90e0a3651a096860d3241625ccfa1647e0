perf/x86/intel/uncore: Factor out box ref/unref functions

For uncore box which can only be accessed by MSR, its reference
box->refcnt is updated in CPU hot plug. The uncore boxes need to be
initalized and exited accordingly for the first/last CPU of a socket.

Starts from Snow Ridge server, a new type of uncore box is introduced,
which can only be accessed by MMIO. The driver needs to map/unmap
MMIO space for the first/last CPU of a socket.

Extract the codes of box ref/unref and init/exit for reuse later.

There is no functional change.
