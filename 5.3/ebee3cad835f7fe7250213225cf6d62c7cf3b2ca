ipv6: Add IPv6 multipath notifications for add / replace

Emit a notification when a multipath routes is added or replace.

Note that unlike the replace notifications sent from fib6_add_rt2node(),
it is possible we are sending a 'FIB_EVENT_ENTRY_REPLACE' when a route
was merely added and not replaced.
