net: phy: dp83867: Rework delay rgmii delay handling

The code was assuming the reset default of the delay control register
was to have delay disabled.  This is what the datasheet shows as the
register's initial value.  However, that's not actually true: the
default is controlled by the PHY's pin strapping.

If the interface mode is selected as RX or TX delay only, insure the
other direction's delay is disabled.

If the interface mode is just "rgmii", with neither TX or RX internal
delay, one might expect that the driver should disable both delays.  But
this is not what the driver does.  It leaves the setting at the PHY's
strapping's default.  And that default, for no pins with strapping
resistors, is to have delay enabled and 2.00 ns.

Rather than change this behavior, I've kept it the same and documented
it.  No delay will most likely not work and will break ethernet on any
board using "rgmii" mode.  If the board is strapped to have a delay and
is configured to use "rgmii" mode a warning is generated that "rgmii-id"
should have been used.

Also validate the delay values and fail if they are not in range.
