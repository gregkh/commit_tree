net: sched: em_ipt: keep the user-specified nfproto and dump it

If we dump NFPROTO_UNSPEC as nfproto user-space libxtables can't handle
it and would exit with an error like:
"libxtables: unhandled NFPROTO in xtables_set_nfproto"
In order to avoid the error return the user-specified nfproto. If we
don't record it then the match family is used which can be
NFPROTO_UNSPEC. Even if we add support to mask NFPROTO_UNSPEC in
iproute2 we have to be compatible with older versions which would be
also be allowed to add NFPROTO_UNSPEC matches (e.g. addrtype after the
last patch).

v3: don't use the user nfproto for matching, only for dumping the rule,
    also don't allow the nfproto to be unspecified (explained above)
v2: adjust changes to missing patch, was patch 04 in v1
