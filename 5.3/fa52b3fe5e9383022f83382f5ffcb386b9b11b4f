intel_th: msu: Support multipage blocks

Now that the MSU is using scatterlist, we can support multipage blocks.
At the moment, the code assumes that all blocks are page-sized, but in
larger buffers it may make sense to chunk together larger blocks of
memory. One place where one-to-many relationship needs to be handled is
the MSU buffer's mmap path.

Get rid of the implicit assumption that all blocks are page-sized.
