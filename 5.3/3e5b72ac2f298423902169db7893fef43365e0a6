net/mlx5: Issue SW reset on FW assert

If a FW assert is considered fatal, indicated by a new bit in the health
buffer, reset the FW. After the reset go through the normal recovery
flow. Only one PF needs to issue the reset, so an attempt is made to
prevent the 2nd function from also issuing the reset.
It's not an error if that happens, it just slows recovery.
