ASoC: tas571x: Fix -Wunused-const-variable

Clang produces the following warning

sound/soc/codecs/tas571x.c:666:38: warning: unused variable
'tas5721_controls' [-Wunused-const-variable]

In the chip struct definition tas5711_controls is used rather than
tac5712_controls. Looks like a typo was made in the original commit.

Since tac5711_controls is identical to tas5721_controls we can just swap
them
