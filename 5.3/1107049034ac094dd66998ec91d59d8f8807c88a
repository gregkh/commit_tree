ABI: better identificate tables

When parsing via script, it is important to know if the script
should consider a description as a literal block that should
be displayed as-is, or if the description can be considered
as a normal text.

Change descriptions to ensure that the preceding line of a table
ends with a colon. That makes easy to identify the need of a
literal block.
