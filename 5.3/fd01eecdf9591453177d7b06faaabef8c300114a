i2c: iproc: Fix i2c master read more than 63 bytes

Use SMBUS_MASTER_DATA_READ.MASTER_RD_STATUS bit to check for RX
FIFO empty condition because SMBUS_MASTER_FIFO_CONTROL.MASTER_RX_PKT_COUNT
is not updated for read >= 64 bytes. This fixes the issue when trying to
read from the I2C slave more than 63 bytes.

Fixes: c24b8d574b7c ("i2c: iproc: Extend I2C read up to 255 bytes")
