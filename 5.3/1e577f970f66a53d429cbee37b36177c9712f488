mm, memcg: introduce memory.events.local

The memory controller in cgroup v2 exposes memory.events file for each
memcg which shows the number of times events like low, high, max, oom
and oom_kill have happened for the whole tree rooted at that memcg.
Users can also poll or register notification to monitor the changes in
that file.  Any event at any level of the tree rooted at memcg will
notify all the listeners along the path till root_mem_cgroup.  There are
existing users which depend on this behavior.

However there are users which are only interested in the events
happening at a specific level of the memcg tree and not in the events in
the underlying tree rooted at that memcg.  One such use-case is a
centralized resource monitor which can dynamically adjust the limits of
the jobs running on a system.  The jobs can create their sub-hierarchy
for their own sub-tasks.  The centralized monitor is only interested in
the events at the top level memcgs of the jobs as it can then act and
adjust the limits of the jobs.  Using the current memory.events for such
centralized monitor is very inconvenient.  The monitor will keep
receiving events which it is not interested and to find if the received
event is interesting, it has to read memory.event files of the next
level and compare it with the top level one.  So, let's introduce
memory.events.local to the memcg which shows and notify for the events
at the memcg level.

Now, does memory.stat and memory.pressure need their local versions.  IMHO
no due to the no internal process contraint of the cgroup v2.  The
memory.stat file of the top level memcg of a job shows the stats and
vmevents of the whole tree.  The local stats or vmevents of the top level
memcg will only change if there is a process running in that memcg but v2
does not allow that.  Similarly for memory.pressure there will not be any
process in the internal nodes and thus no chance of local pressure.
