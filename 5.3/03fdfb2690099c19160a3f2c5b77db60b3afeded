KVM: arm64: Don't write junk to sysregs on reset

At the moment, the way we reset system registers is mildly insane:
We write junk to them, call the reset functions, and then check that
we have something else in them.

The "fun" thing is that this can happen while the guest is running
(PSCI, for example). If anything in KVM has to evaluate the state
of a system register while junk is in there, bad thing may happen.

Let's stop doing that. Instead, we track that we have called a
reset function for that register, and assume that the reset
function has done something. This requires fixing a couple of
sysreg refinition in the trap table.

In the end, the very need of this reset check is pretty dubious,
as it doesn't check everything (a lot of the sysregs leave outside of
the sys_regs[] array). It may well be axed in the near future.
