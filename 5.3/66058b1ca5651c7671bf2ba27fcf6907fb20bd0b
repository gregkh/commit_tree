Revert ("r8169: remove 1000/Half from supported modes")

This reverts commit a6851c613fd7fccc5d1f28d5d8a0cbe9b0f4e8cc.
It was reported that RTL8111b successfully finishes 1000/Full autoneg
but no data flows. Reverting the original patch fixes the issue.
It seems to be a HW issue with the integrated RTL8211B PHY. This PHY
version used also e.g. on RTL8168d, so better revert the original patch.
