bcache: check CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE in allocator code

If CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE of a cache set flag is set by too many I/O
errors, currently allocator routines can still continue allocate
space which may introduce inconsistent metadata state.

This patch checkes CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE bit in following allocator
routines,
- bch_bucket_alloc()
- __bch_bucket_alloc_set()
Once CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE is set on cache set, the allocator routines
may reject allocation request earlier to avoid potential inconsistent
metadata.
