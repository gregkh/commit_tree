net: hns3: don't configure new VLAN ID into VF VLAN table when it's full

VF VLAN table can only support no more than 256 VLANs. When user
adds too many VLANs, the VF VLAN table will be full, and firmware
will close the VF VLAN table for the function. When VF VLAN table
is full, and user keeps adding new VLANs, it's unnecessary to
configure the VF VLAN table, because it will always fail, and print
warning message. The worst case is adding 4K VLANs, and doing reset,
it will take much time to restore these VLANs, which may cause VF
reset fail by timeout.
