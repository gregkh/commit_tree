usb: renesas_usbhs: Use struct assignment instead of memcpy()

To avoid the error-proneness of calls to sizeof() in the memcpy,
this patch uses struct assignment instead of memcpy.

 This patch is based on Greg's linux-usb.git / usb-next branch.
 Note that mod_host.c also has memcpy but we cannot use struct assignment
 for it because the type of urb->setup_patcket is just "unsigned char *".
