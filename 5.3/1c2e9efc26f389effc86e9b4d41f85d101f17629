libbpf: introduce concept of bpf_link

bpf_link is an abstraction of an association of a BPF program and one of
many possible BPF attachment points (hooks). This allows to have uniform
interface for detaching BPF programs regardless of the nature of link
and how it was created. Details of creation and setting up of a specific
bpf_link is handled by corresponding attachment methods
(bpf_program__attach_xxx) added in subsequent commits. Once successfully
created, bpf_link has to be eventually destroyed with
bpf_link__destroy(), at which point BPF program is disassociated from
a hook and all the relevant resources are freed.
