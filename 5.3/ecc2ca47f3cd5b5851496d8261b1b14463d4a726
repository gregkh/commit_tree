mfd: cros_ec_dev: Register cros_ec_accel_legacy driver as a subdevice

With this patch, the cros_ec_ctl driver will register the legacy
accelerometer driver (named cros_ec_accel_legacy) if it fails to
register sensors through the usual path cros_ec_sensors_register().
This legacy device is present on Chromebook devices with older EC
firmware only supporting deprecated EC commands:
- Glimmer based devices [Intel SOC using LPC transport]
- Veyron minnie devices [ARM SOC using SPI transport]
