ARM: bcm283x: Enable DMA support for SPI controller

Without this, the driver for the BCM2835 SPI controller uses interrupt
mode instead of DMA mode, incurring a significant performance penalty.
The Foundation's device tree has had these attributes for years, but for
some reason they were never upstreamed.

They were originally contributed by Noralf Trønnes and Martin Sperl:

The DREQ numbers 6 and 7 are documented in section 4.2.1.3 of:
