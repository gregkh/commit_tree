platform/x86: intel_cht_int33fe: Provide fwnode for the USB connector

In ACPI, and now also in DT, the USB connectors usually have
their own device nodes. In case of USB Type-C, those
connector (port) nodes are child nodes of the controller or
PHY device, in our case the fusb302. The software fwnodes
allow us to create a similar child node for fusb302 that
represents the connector also on Intel CHT.

This makes it possible replace the fusb302 specific device
properties which were deprecated with the common USB
connector properties that tcpm.c is able to use directly.
