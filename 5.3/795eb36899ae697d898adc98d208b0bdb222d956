staging: rtl8712: Replace function r8712_init_evt_priv()

Remove function r8712_init_evt_priv as all it does is call
_init_evt_priv.
Rename _init_evt_priv to r8712_init_evt_priv to maintain compatibility
with call sites.
Change type of new r8712_init_evt_priv from static to non-static as
original r8712_init_evt_priv was non-static.
Change return type of new r8712_init_evt_priv to int as original had
return type u32 but new (formerly _init_evt_priv) had return type sint.
