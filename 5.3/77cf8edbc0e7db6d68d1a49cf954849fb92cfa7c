tipc: simplify stale link failure criteria

In commit a4dc70d46cf1 ("tipc: extend link reset criteria for stale
packet retransmission") we made link retransmission failure events
dependent on the link tolerance, and not only of the number of failed
retransmission attempts, as we did earlier. This works well. However,
keeping the original, additional criteria of 99 failed retransmissions
is now redundant, and may in some cases lead to failure detection
times in the order of minutes instead of the expected 1.5 sec link
tolerance value.

We now remove this criteria altogether.
