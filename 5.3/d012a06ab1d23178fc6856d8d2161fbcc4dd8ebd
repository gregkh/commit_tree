Revert "KVM: x86/mmu: Zap only the relevant pages when removing a memslot"

This reverts commit 4e103134b862314dc2f2f18f2fb0ab972adc3f5f.
Alex Williamson reported regressions with device assignment with
this patch.  Even though the bug is probably elsewhere and still
latent, this is needed to fix the regression.
