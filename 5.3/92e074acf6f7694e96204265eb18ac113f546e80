firmware/psci: psci_checker: Park kthreads before stopping them

Since commit 85f1abe0019f ("kthread, sched/wait: Fix kthread_parkme()
completion issue"), kthreads that are bound to a CPU must be parked
before being stopped. At the moment the PSCI checker calls
kthread_stop() directly on the suspend kthread, which triggers the
following warning:

[    6.068288] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at kernel/kthread.c:398 __kthread_bind_mask+0x20/0x78

kthread_unpark() tries to bind the thread to its CPU and aborts with a
WARN() if the thread wasn't in TASK_PARKED state. Park the kthreads
before stopping them.
