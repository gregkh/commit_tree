tracing: Make exported ftrace_set_clr_event non-static

The function ftrace_set_clr_event is declared static and marked
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), which is at best an odd combination. Because the
function was decided to be a part of API, this commit removes the static
attribute and adds the declaration to the header.
