xen/events: fix binding user event channels to cpus

When binding an interdomain event channel to a vcpu via
IOCTL_EVTCHN_BIND_INTERDOMAIN not only the event channel needs to be
bound, but the affinity of the associated IRQi must be changed, too.
Otherwise the IRQ and the event channel won't be moved to another vcpu
in case the original vcpu they were bound to is going offline.
