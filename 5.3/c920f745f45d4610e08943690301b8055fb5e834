net: phy: Add phy_standalone sysfs entry

Export a phy_standalone device attribute that is meant to give the
indication that this PHY lacks an attached_dev and its corresponding
sysfs link. The attribute will be created only when the
phy_attach_direct() function will be called with a NULL net_device.
