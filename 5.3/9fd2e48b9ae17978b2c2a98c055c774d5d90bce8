perf/core: Allow non-privileged uprobe for user processes

Currently, non-privileged user could only use uprobe with

    kernel.perf_event_paranoid = -1

However, setting perf_event_paranoid to -1 leaks other users' processes to
non-privileged uprobes.

To introduce proper permission control of uprobes, we are building the
following system:

  A daemon with CAP_SYS_ADMIN is in charge to create uprobes via tracefs;
  Users asks the daemon to create uprobes;
  Then user can attach uprobe only to processes owned by the user.

This patch allows non-privileged user to attach uprobe to processes owned
by the user.

The following example shows how to use uprobe with non-privileged user.
This is based on Brendan's blog post [1]

1. Create uprobe with root:

  sudo perf probe -x 'readline%return +0($retval):string'

2. Then non-root user can use the uprobe as:

  perf record -vvv -e probe_bash:readline__return -p <pid> sleep 20
  perf script
