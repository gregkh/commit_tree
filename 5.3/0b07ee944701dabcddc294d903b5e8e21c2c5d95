PM / QOS: Pass request type to dev_pm_qos_{add|remove}_notifier()

In order to use the same set of routines to register notifiers for
different request types, update the existing
dev_pm_qos_{add|remove}_notifier() routines with an additional
parameter: request-type.

For now, it only supports resume-latency request type but will be
extended to frequency limit (min/max) constraints later on.
