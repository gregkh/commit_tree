signal: Factor force_sig_info_to_task out of force_sig_info

All callers of force_sig_info pass info.si_signo in for the signal
by definition as well as in practice.

Further all callers of force_sig_info except force_sig_fault_to_task
pass current as the target task to force_sig_info.

Factor out a static force_sig_info_to_task that
force_sig_fault_to_task can call.

This prepares the way for force_sig_info to have it's task and signal
parameters removed.
