KVM: nVMX: Add helpers to identify shadowed VMCS fields

So that future optimizations related to shadowed fields don't need to
define their own switch statement.

Add a BUILD_BUG_ON() to ensure at least one of the types (RW vs RO) is
defined when including vmcs_shadow_fields.h (guess who keeps mistyping
SHADOW_FIELD_RO as SHADOW_FIELD_R0).
