nvmem: imx-ocotp: imx8mq is compatible with imx6 not imx7

According to NXP Reference Manuals and uboot/atf sources the OCOTP block
on imx8m behaves more like imx6 than imx7.

- Fuses can be read/written 32bits at a time (no imx7-like banking)
- The OCOTP_HW_OCOTP_TIMING register is like imx6 not imx7

Since nvmem doesn't support uboot-style "sense" and "override" this
issue only affected "write" which is very rarely used.
