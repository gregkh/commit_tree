ALSA: firewire-lib: use 16 bytes IR context header to separate CIP header

In IR context, some quadlets of packet payload can be included into
context header. This is good for packet with CIP header because the
context payload buffer can includes data blocks only for with-CIP and
without-CIP pakets.

This commit uses 16 bytes IR context header for this purpose.
