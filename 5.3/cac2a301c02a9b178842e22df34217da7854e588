RDMA/uverbs: check for allocation failure in uapi_add_elm()

If the kzalloc() fails then we should return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).  In the
current code it's possible that the kzalloc() fails and the
radix_tree_insert() inserts the NULL pointer successfully and we return
the NULL "elm" pointer to the caller.  That results in a NULL pointer
dereference.
