lockd: Convert NLM service fl_owner to nlm_lockowner

Do as the NLM client: allocate and track a struct nlm_lockowner for use as
the fl_owner for locks created by the NLM sever.  This allows us to keep
the svid within this structure for matching locks, and will allow us to
track the pid of lockd in a future patch.  It should also allow easier
reference of the nlm_host in conflicting locks, and simplify lock hashing
and comparison.
