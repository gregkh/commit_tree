Input: applespi - use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct touchpad_protocol {
	...
        struct tp_finger        fingers[0];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*tp) + tp->number_of_fingers * sizeof(tp->fingers[0]);

with:

struct_size(tp, fingers, tp->number_of_fingers)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
