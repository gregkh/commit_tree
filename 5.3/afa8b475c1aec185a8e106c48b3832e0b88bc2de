x86/timer: Force PIT initialization when !X86_FEATURE_ARAT

KVM guests with commit c8c4076723da ("x86/timer: Skip PIT initialization on
modern chipsets") applied to guest kernel have been observed to have
unusually higher CPU usage with symptoms of increase in vm exits for HLT
and MSW_WRITE (MSR_IA32_TSCDEADLINE).

This is caused by older QEMUs lacking support for X86_FEATURE_ARAT.  lapic
clock retains CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP and nohz stays inactive.  There's no
usable broadcast device either.

Do the PIT initialization if guest CPU lacks X86_FEATURE_ARAT.  On real
hardware it shouldn't matter as ARAT and DEADLINE come together.
