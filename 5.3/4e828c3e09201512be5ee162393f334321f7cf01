serial: imx: fix locking in set_termios()

imx_uart_set_termios() called imx_uart_rts_active(), or
imx_uart_rts_inactive() before taking port->port.lock.

As a consequence, sport->port.mctrl that these functions modify
could have been changed without holding port->port.lock.

Moved locking of port->port.lock above the calls to fix the issue.
