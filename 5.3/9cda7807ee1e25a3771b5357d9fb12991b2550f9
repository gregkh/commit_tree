veth: Support bulk XDP_TX

XDP_TX is similar to XDP_REDIRECT as it essentially redirects packets to
the device itself. XDP_REDIRECT has bulk transmit mechanism to avoid the
heavy cost of indirect call but it also reduces lock acquisition on the
destination device that needs locks like veth and tun.

XDP_TX does not use indirect calls but drivers which require locks can
benefit from the bulk transmit for XDP_TX as well.

This patch introduces bulk transmit mechanism in veth using bulk queue
on stack, and improves XDP_TX performance by about 9%.

Here are single-core/single-flow XDP_TX test results. CPU consumptions
are taken from "perf report --no-child".

- Before:

  7.26 Mpps

  _raw_spin_lock  7.83%
  veth_xdp_xmit  12.23%

- After:

  7.94 Mpps

  _raw_spin_lock  1.08%
  veth_xdp_xmit   6.10%

v2:
- Use stack for bulk queue instead of a global variable.
