mm/z3fold.c: allow __GFP_HIGHMEM in z3fold_alloc

One of the gfp flags used to show that a page is movable is
__GFP_HIGHMEM.  Currently z3fold_alloc() fails when __GFP_HIGHMEM is
passed.  Now that z3fold pages are movable, we allow __GFP_HIGHMEM.  We
strip the movability related flags from the call to kmem_cache_alloc()
for our slots since it is a kernel allocation.
