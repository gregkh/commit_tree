drm/doc: Allow new UAPI to be used once it's in drm-next/drm-misc-next.

I was trying to figure out if it was permissible to merge the Mesa
side of V3D's CSD support yet while it's in drm-misc-next but not
drm-next, and developers on #dri-devel IRC had differing opinions of
what the requirement was.

v2: Restrict to just drm-next or drm-misc-next on airlied's request.
