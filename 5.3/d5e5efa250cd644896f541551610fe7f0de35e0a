f2fs: remove redundant check from f2fs_setflags_common()

Now that f2fs_ioc_setflags() and f2fs_ioc_fssetxattr() call the VFS
helper functions which check for permission to change the immutable and
append-only flags, it's no longer needed to do this check in
f2fs_setflags_common() too.  So remove it.

This is based on a patch from Darrick Wong, but reworked to apply after
commit 360985573b55 ("f2fs: separate f2fs i_flags from fs_flags and ext4
i_flags").
