i40e: Use signed variable

The counter variable in i40e_clean_tx_irq starts out negative and climbs
to 0. So it should not be defined as a u16. This was working by accident
due to the fact the u16 overflows and underflows predictably.

Replace the u16 with int, which is signed and can handle the negativity.
