cifs: fix crash in smb2_compound_op()/smb2_set_next_command()

RHBZ: 1722704

In low memory situations the various SMB2_*_init() functions can fail
to allocate a request PDU and thus leave the request iovector as NULL.

If we don't check the return code for failure we end up calling
smb2_set_next_command() with a NULL iovector causing a crash when it tries
to dereference it.
