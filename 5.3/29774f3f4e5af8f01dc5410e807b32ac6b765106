fs/hfsplus/xattr.c: replace strncpy with memcpy

strncpy() was used to copy a fixed size buffer.  Since NUL-terminating
string is not required here, prefer a memcpy function.  The generated
code (ppc32) remains the same.

Silence the following warning triggered using W=1:

  fs/hfsplus/xattr.c:410:3: warning: 'strncpy' output truncated before terminating nul copying 4 bytes from a string of the same length [-Wstringop-truncation]
