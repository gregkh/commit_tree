crypto: inside-secure - change returned error when a descriptor reports an error

This patch changes the error reported by the Inside Secure SafeXcel
driver when a result descriptor reports an error, from -EIO to -EINVAL,
as this is what the crypto framework expects. This was found while
running the crypto extra tests.
