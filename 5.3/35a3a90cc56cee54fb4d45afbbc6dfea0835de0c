afs: yfsclient: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

fs/afs/yfsclient.c: In function ‘yfs_deliver_fs_fetch_opaque_acl’:
fs/afs/yfsclient.c:1984:19: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

  case 5:
  ^~~~

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

Also, fix some commenting style issues.

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
