s390/cio: add basic protected virtualization support

As virtio-ccw devices are channel devices, we need to use the
dma area within the common I/O layer for any communication with
the hypervisor.

Note that we do not need to use that area for control blocks
directly referenced by instructions, e.g. the orb.

It handles neither QDIO in the common code, nor any device type specific
stuff (like channel programs constructed by the DASD driver).

An interesting side effect is that virtio structures are now going to
get allocated in 31 bit addressable storage.
