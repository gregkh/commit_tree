ASoC: soc-core: use soc_find_component() at snd_soc_find_dai()

snd_soc_find_dai() finds component first via specified
snd_soc_dai_link_component, and find DAI from it.

We already have soc_find_component() to find component,
but soc_find_dai() has original implementation to find component.

We shouldn't have duplicate implementation to do same things.
This patch uses soc_find_component() at soc_find_dai()
