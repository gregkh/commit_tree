phy: usb: phy-brcm-usb: Remove sysfs attributes upon driver removal

We are not destroying the sysfs attribute groupe we registered during
the probe function which will make subsequent probe calls to that
driver fail. Correct that with adding a remove function which only
removes those attributes since the reference counting on clocks did its
job already.
