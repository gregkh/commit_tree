mm/gup.c: remove some BUG_ONs from get_gate_page()

If we end up without a PGD or PUD entry backing the gate area, don't BUG
-- just fail gracefully.

It's not entirely implausible that this could happen some day on x86.  It
doesn't right now even with an execute-only emulated vsyscall page because
the fixmap shares the PUD, but the core mm code shouldn't rely on that
particular detail to avoid OOPSing.
