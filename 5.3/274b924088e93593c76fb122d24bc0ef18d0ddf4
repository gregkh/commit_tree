libnvdimm/pfn: Fix namespace creation on misaligned addresses

Yi reported[1] that after commit a3619190d62e ("libnvdimm/pfn: stop
padding pmem namespaces to section alignment"), it was no longer
possible to create a device dax namespace with a 1G alignment.  The
reason was that the pmem region was not itself 1G-aligned.  The code
happily skips past the first 512M, but fails to account for a now
misaligned end offset (since space was allocated starting at that
misaligned address, and extending for size GBs).  Reintroduce
end_trunc, so that the code correctly handles the misaligned end
address.  This results in the same behavior as before the introduction
of the offending commit.
