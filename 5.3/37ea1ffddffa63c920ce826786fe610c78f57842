coresight: Use fwnode handle instead of device names

We rely on the device names to find a CoreSight device on the
coresight bus. The device name however is obtained from the platform,
which is bound to the real platform/amba device. As we are about
to use different naming scheme for the coresight devices, we can't
rely on the platform device name to find the corresponding
coresight device. Instead we use the platform agnostic
"fwnode handle" of the parent device to find the devices.
We also reuse the same fwnode as the parent for the Coresight
device we create.
