ipv6: Allow routes to use nexthop objects

Add support for RTA_NH_ID attribute to allow a user to specify a
nexthop id to use with a route. fc_nh_id is added to fib6_config to
hold the value passed in the RTA_NH_ID attribute. If a nexthop id
is given, the gateway, device, encap and multipath attributes can
not be set.

Update ip6_route_del to check metric and protocol before nexthop
specs. If fc_nh_id is set, then it must match the id in the route
entry. Since IPv6 allows delete of a cached entry (an exception),
add ip6_del_cached_rt_nh to cycle through all of the fib6_nh in
a fib entry if it is using a nexthop.
