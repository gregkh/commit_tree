mm: remove the exporting of totalram_pages

Previously totalram_pages was the global variable.  Currently,
totalram_pages is the static inline function from the include/linux/mm.h
However, the function is also marked as EXPORT_SYMBOL, which is at best an
odd combination.  Because there is no point for the static inline function
from a public header to be exported, this commit removes the
EXPORT_SYMBOL() marking.  It will be still possible to use the function in
modules because all the symbols it depends on are exported.
