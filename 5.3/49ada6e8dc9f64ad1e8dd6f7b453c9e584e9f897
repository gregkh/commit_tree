ceph: more precise CEPH_CLIENT_CAPS_PENDING_CAPSNAP

Client uses this flag to tell mds if there is more cap snap need to
flush. It's mainly for the case that client needs to re-send cap/snap
flushes after mds failover, but CEPH_CAP_ANY_FILE_WR on corresponding
inodes are all released before mds failover.
