media: videobuf2-dma-sg: Prevent size from overflowing

buf->size is an unsigned long; casting that to int will lead to an
overflow if buf->size exceeds INT_MAX.

Fix this by changing the type to unsigned long instead. This is possible
as the buf->size is always aligned to PAGE_SIZE, and therefore the size
will never have values lesser than 0.

Note on backporting to stable: the file used to be under
drivers/media/v4l2-core, it was moved to the current location after 4.14.
