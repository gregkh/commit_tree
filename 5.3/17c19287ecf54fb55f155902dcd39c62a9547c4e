RDMA/siw: Fix a memory leak in siw_init_cpulist()

The error handling code doesn't free siw_cpu_info.tx_valid_cpus[0].  The
first iteration through the loop is a no-op so this is sort of an off
by one bug.  Also Bernard pointed out that we can remove the NULL
assignment and simplify the code a bit.
