afs: afs_unlink() doesn't need to check dentry->d_inode

Don't check that dentry->d_inode is valid in afs_unlink().  We should be
able to take that as given.

This caused Smatch to issue the following warning:

	fs/afs/dir.c:1392 afs_unlink() error: we previously assumed 'vnode' could be null (see line 1375)
