net: dsa: Deal with non-existing PHY/fixed-link

We need to specifically deal with phylink_of_phy_connect() returning
-ENODEV, because this can happen when a CPU/DSA port does connect
neither to a PHY, nor has a fixed-link property. This is a valid use
case that is permitted by the binding and indicates to the switch:
auto-configure port with maximum capabilities.
