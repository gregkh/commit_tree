net/mlx5e: Calculate linear RX frag size considering XSK

Additional conditions introduced:

- XSK implies XDP.
- Headroom includes the XSK headroom if it exists.
- No space is reserved for struct shared_skb_info in XSK mode.
- Fragment size smaller than the XSK chunk size is not allowed.

A new auxiliary function mlx5e_get_linear_rq_headroom with the support
for XSK is introduced. Use this function in the implementation of
mlx5e_get_rq_headroom. Change headroom to u32 to match the headroom
field in struct xdp_umem.
