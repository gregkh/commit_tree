debugobjects: Reduce number of pool_lock acquisitions in fill_pool()

In fill_pool(), the pool_lock is acquired and then released once per debug
object. If many objects are to be filled, the constant lock and unlock
operations are extra overhead.

To reduce the overhead, batch them up and do an allocation of 4 objects per
lock/unlock sequence.
