Input: elan_i2c - export the device id whitelist

Elan_i2c and hid-quirks work in conjunction to decide which devices each
driver will handle.  Elan_i2c has a whitelist of devices that should be
consumed by hid-quirks so that there is one master list of devices to
handoff between the drivers.  Put the ids in a header file so that
hid-quirks can consume it instead of duplicating the list.
