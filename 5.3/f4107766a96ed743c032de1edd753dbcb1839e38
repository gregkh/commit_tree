drm/i915/hangcheck: Track context changes

Given sufficient preemption, we may see a busy system that doesn't
advance seqno while performing work across multiple contexts, and given
sufficient pathology not even notice a change in ACTHD. What does change
between the preempting contexts is their RING, so take note of that and
treat a change in the ring address as being an indication of forward
progress.
