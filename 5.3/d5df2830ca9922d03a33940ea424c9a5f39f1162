devmap/cpumap: Use flush list instead of bitmap

The socket map uses a linked list instead of a bitmap to keep track of
which entries to flush. Do the same for devmap and cpumap, as this means we
don't have to care about the map index when enqueueing things into the
map (and so we can cache the map lookup).
