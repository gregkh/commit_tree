move the capability checks from sget_userns() to legacy_get_tree()

1) all call chains leading to sget_userns() pass through ->mount()
instances.
2) none of ->mount() instances is ever called directly - the only
call site is legacy_get_tree()
3) all remaining ->mount() instances end up calling sget_userns()

IOW, we might as well do the capability checks just before calling
->mount().  As for the arguments passed to mount_capable(),
in case of call chains to sget_userns() going through sget(),
we either don't call mount_capable() at all, or pass current_user_ns()
to it.  The call chains going through mount_pseudo_xattr() don't
call mount_capable() at all (SB_KERNMOUNT in flags on those).

That could've been split into smaller steps (lifting the checks
into sget(), then callers of sget(), then all the way to the
entries of every ->mount() out there, then to the sole caller),
but that would be too much churn for little benefit...
