iommu/vt-d: Handle RMRR with PCI bridge device scopes

When reading the vtd specification and especially the
Reserved Memory Region Reporting Structure chapter,
it is not obvious a device scope element cannot be a
PCI-PCI bridge, in which case all downstream ports are
likely to access the reserved memory region. Let's handle
this case in device_has_rmrr.
