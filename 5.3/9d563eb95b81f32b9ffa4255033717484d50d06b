Revert "ASoC: core: use component driver name as component name"

Using component driver as a name is not unique and it breaks audio in
certain configurations, e.g. Hardkernel Odroid XU3 board where following
components are registered:
 - "3830000.i2s" with driver name "snd_dmaengine_pcm"
 - "3830000.i2s-sec" with driver name "snd_dmaengine_pcm"
 - "3830000.i2s" with driver name "samsung-i2s"

This reverts commit b19671d6caf1ac393681864d5d85dda9fa99a448.
