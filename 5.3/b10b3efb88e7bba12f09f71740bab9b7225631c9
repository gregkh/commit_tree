perf/x86/intel/rapl: Support multi-die/package

RAPL becomes die-scope on Xeon Cascade Lake-AP. Perf RAPL driver needs to
support die-scope RAPL domain.

Use topology_logical_die_id() to replace topology_logical_package_id().
For previous platforms which doesn't have multi-die,
topology_logical_die_id() is identical as topology_logical_package_id().

Use topology_die_cpumask() to replace topology_core_cpumask().  For
previous platforms which doesn't have multi-die, topology_die_cpumask() is
identical as topology_core_cpumask().

There is no functional change for previous platforms.
