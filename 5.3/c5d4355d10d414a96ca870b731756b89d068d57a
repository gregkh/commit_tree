libnvdimm: nd_region flush callback support

This patch adds functionality to perform flush from guest
to host over VIRTIO. We are registering a callback based
on 'nd_region' type. virtio_pmem driver requires this special
flush function. For rest of the region types we are registering
existing flush function. Report error returned by host fsync
failure to userspace.
