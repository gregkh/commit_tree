pwm: jz4740: Force TCU2 channels to return to their init level

When the PWM mode of TCU2 channels is disabled, their corresponding pin
does not always return to its initial level. Force this by using a small
trick: we set duty > period, which is an invalid configuration for the
hardware, which then correctly resets the pin to the initial level.
