Staging: fbtft: Fix probing of gpio descriptor

Conversion to use gpio descriptors broke all gpio lookups as
devm_gpiod_get_index was converted to use dev->driver->name for
the gpio name lookup. Fix this by using the name param. In
addition gpiod_get post-fixes the -gpios to the name so that
shouldn't be included in the call. However this then breaks the
of_find_property call to see if the gpio entry exists as all
fbtft treats all gpios as optional. So use devm_gpiod_get_index_optional
instead which achieves the same thing and is simpler.

Nishad confirmed the changes where only ever compile tested.
