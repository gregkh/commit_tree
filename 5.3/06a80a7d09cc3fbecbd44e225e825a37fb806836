net: stmmac: Fix descriptors address being in > 32 bits address space

Commit a993db88d17d ("net: stmmac: Enable support for > 32 Bits
addressing in XGMAC"), introduced support for > 32 bits addressing in
XGMAC but the conversion of descriptors to dma_addr_t was left out.

As some devices assing coherent memory in regions > 32 bits we need to
set lower and upper value of descriptors address when initializing DMA
channels.

Luckly, this was working for me because I was assigning CMA to < 4GB
address space for performance reasons.
