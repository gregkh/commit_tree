signal/arm64: Use force_sig not force_sig_fault for SIGKILL

I don't think this is userspace visible but SIGKILL does not have
any si_codes that use the fault member of the siginfo union.  Correct
this the simple way and call force_sig instead of force_sig_fault when
the signal is SIGKILL.

The two know places where synchronous SIGKILL are generated are
do_bad_area and fpsimd_save.  The call paths to force_sig_fault are:
do_bad_area
  arm64_force_sig_fault
    force_sig_fault
force_signal_inject
  arm64_notify_die
    arm64_force_sig_fault
       force_sig_fault

Which means correcting this in arm64_force_sig_fault is enough
to ensure the arm64 code is not misusing the generic code, which
could lead to maintenance problems later.
