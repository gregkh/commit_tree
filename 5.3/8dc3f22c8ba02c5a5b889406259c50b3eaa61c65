btrfs: check for supported superblock checksum type before checksum validation

Now that we have factorerd out the superblock checksum type validation,
we can check for supported superblock checksum types before doing the
actual validation of the superblock read from disk.

This leads the path to further simplifications of
btrfs_check_super_csum() later on.
