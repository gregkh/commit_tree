drm/i915: Engine discovery query

Engine discovery query allows userspace to enumerate engines, probe their
configuration features, all without needing to maintain the internal PCI
ID based database.

A new query for the generic i915 query ioctl is added named
DRM_I915_QUERY_ENGINE_INFO, together with accompanying structure
drm_i915_query_engine_info. The address of latter should be passed to the
kernel in the query.data_ptr field, and should be large enough for the
kernel to fill out all known engines as struct drm_i915_engine_info
elements trailing the query.

As with other queries, setting the item query length to zero allows
userspace to query minimum required buffer size.

Enumerated engines have common type mask which can be used to query all
hardware engines, versus engines userspace can submit to using the execbuf
uAPI.

Engines also have capabilities which are per engine class namespace of
bits describing features not present on all engine instances.

v2:
 * Fixed HEVC assignment.
 * Reorder some fields, rename type to flags, increase width. (Lionel)
 * No need to allocate temporary storage if we do it engine by engine.
   (Lionel)

v3:
 * Describe engine flags and mark mbz fields. (Lionel)
 * HEVC only applies to VCS.

v4:
 * Squash SFC flag into main patch.
 * Tidy some comments.

v5:
 * Add uabi_ prefix to engine capabilities. (Chris Wilson)
 * Report exact size of engine info array. (Chris Wilson)
 * Drop the engine flags. (Joonas Lahtinen)
 * Added some more reserved fields.
 * Move flags after class/instance.

v6:
 * Do not check engine info array was zeroed by userspace but zero the
   unused fields for them instead.

v7:
 * Simplify length calculation loop. (Lionel Landwerlin)

v8:
 * Remove MBZ comments where not applicable.
 * Rename ABI flags to match engine class define naming.
 * Rename SFC ABI flag to reflect it applies to VCS and VECS.
 * SFC is wired to even _logical_ engine instances.
 * SFC applies to VCS and VECS.
 * HEVC is present on all instances on Gen11. (Tony)
 * Simplify length calculation even more. (Chris Wilson)
 * Move info_ptr assigment closer to loop for clarity. (Chris Wilson)
 * Use vdbox_sfc_access from runtime info.
 * Rebase for RUNTIME_INFO.
 * Refactor for lower indentation.
 * Rename uAPI class/instance to engine_class/instance to avoid C++
   keyword.

v9:
 * Rebase for s/num_rings/num_engines/ in RUNTIME_INFO.

v10:
 * Use new copy_query_item.

v11:
 * Consolidate with struct i915_engine_class_instnace.
