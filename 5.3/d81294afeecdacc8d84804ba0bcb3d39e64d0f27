drm/fb-helper: Remove drm_fb_helper_crtc

struct drm_fb_helper_crtc is now just a wrapper around drm_mode_set so
use that directly instead and attach it as a modeset array onto
drm_client_dev. drm_fb_helper will use this array to store its modesets
which means it will always initialize a drm_client, but it will not
register the client (callbacks) unless it's the generic fbdev emulation.

Code will later be moved to drm_client, so add code there in a new file
drm_client_modeset.c with MIT license to match drm_fb_helper.c.

The modeset connector array size is hardcoded for the cloned case to avoid
having to pass in a value from the driver. A value of 8 is chosen to err
on the safe side. This means that the max connector argument for
drm_fb_helper_init() and drm_fb_helper_fbdev_setup() isn't used anymore,
a todo entry for this is added.

In pan_display_atomic() restore_fbdev_mode_force() is used instead of
restore_fbdev_mode_atomic() because that one will later become internal
to drm_client_modeset.

Locking order:
1. drm_fb_helper->lock
2. drm_master_internal_acquire
3. drm_client_dev->modeset_mutex
