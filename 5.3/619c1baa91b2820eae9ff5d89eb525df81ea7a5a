genirq/timings: Fix next event index function

The current code is luckily working with most of the interval samples
testing but actually it fails to correctly detect pattern repetition
breaking at the end of the buffer.

Narrowing down the bug has been a real pain because of the pointers,
so the routine is rewrittne by using indexes instead.
