ASoC: qcom: apq8016_sbc: Fix oops with multiple DAI links

apq8016_sbc_parse_of() sets up multiple DAI links, depending on the
number of nodes in the device tree. However, at the moment
CPU and platform components are only allocated for the first link.
This causes an oops when more than one link is defined:

	Internal error: Oops: 96000044 [#1] SMP
	CPU: 0 PID: 1015 Comm: kworker/0:2 Not tainted 5.3.0-rc1 #4
	Call trace:
	 apq8016_sbc_platform_probe+0x1a8/0x3f0
	 platform_drv_probe+0x50/0xa0
	...

Move the allocation inside the loop to ensure that each link is
properly initialized.
