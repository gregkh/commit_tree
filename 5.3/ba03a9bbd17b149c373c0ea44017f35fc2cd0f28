VMCI: Release resource if the work is already queued

Francois reported that VMware balloon gets stuck after a balloon reset,
when the VMCI doorbell is removed. A similar error can occur when the
balloon driver is removed with the following splat:

The cause for the bug is that when the "delayed" doorbell is invoked, it
takes a reference on the doorbell entry and schedules work that is
supposed to run the appropriate code and drop the doorbell entry
reference. The code ignores the fact that if the work is already queued,
it will not be scheduled to run one more time. As a result one of the
references would not be dropped. When the code waits for the reference
to get to zero, during balloon reset or module removal, it gets stuck.

Fix it. Drop the reference if schedule_work() indicates that the work is
already queued.

Note that this bug got more apparent (or apparent at all) due to
commit ce664331b248 ("vmw_balloon: VMCI_DOORBELL_SET does not check status").
