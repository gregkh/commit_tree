arm64/mm: Correct the cache line size warning with non coherent device

If the cache line size is greater than ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN (128),
the warning shows and it's tainted as TAINT_CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC.

However, it's not good because as discussed in the thread [1], the cpu
cache line size will be problem only on non-coherent devices.

Since the coherent flag is already introduced to struct device,
show the warning only if the device is non-coherent device and
ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN is smaller than the cpu cache size.
