ALSA: hda - Workaround for crackled sound on AMD controller (1022:1457)

A long-time problem on the recent AMD chip (X370, X470, B450, etc with
PCI ID 1022:1457) with Realtek codecs is the crackled or distorted
sound for capture streams, as well as occasional playback hiccups.
After lengthy debugging sessions, the workarounds we've found are like
the following:

- Set up the proper driver caps for this controller, similar as the
  other AMD controller.

- Correct the DMA position reporting with the fixed FIFO size, which
  is similar like as workaround used for VIA chip set.

- Even after the position correction, PulseAudio still shows
  mysterious stalls of playback streams when a capture is triggered in
  timer-scheduled mode.  Since we have no clear way to eliminate the
  stall, pass the BATCH PCM flag for PA to suppress the tsched mode as
  a temporary workaround.

This patch implements the workarounds.  For the driver caps, it
defines a new preset, AXZ_DCAPS_PRESET_AMD_SB.  It enables the FIFO-
corrected position reporting (corresponding to the new position_fix=6)
and enforces the SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH flag.

Note that the current implementation is merely a workaround.
Hopefully we'll find a better alternative in future, especially about
removing the BATCH flag hack again.
