watchdog: introduce CONFIG_WATCHDOG_OPEN_TIMEOUT

This allows setting a default value for the watchdog.open_timeout
commandline parameter via Kconfig.

Some BSPs allow remote updating of the kernel image and root file
system, but updating the bootloader requires physical access. Hence, if
one has a firmware update that requires relaxing the
watchdog.open_timeout a little, the value used must be baked into the
kernel image itself and cannot come from the u-boot environment via the
kernel command line.

Being able to set the initial value in .config doesn't change the fact
that the value on the command line, if present, takes precedence, and is
of course immensely useful for development purposes while one has
console acccess, as well as usable in the cases where one can make a
permanent update of the kernel command line.
