ptp: add QorIQ PTP support for DPAA2

This patch is to add QorIQ PTP support for DPAA2.
Although dpaa2-ptp.c driver is a fsl_mc_driver which
is using MC APIs for register accessing, it's same
IP block with eTSEC/DPAA/ENETC 1588 timer. We will
convert to reuse ptp_qoriq driver by using register
ioremap and dropping related MC APIs.
Also allow to compile ptp_qoriq with COMPILE_TEST.
