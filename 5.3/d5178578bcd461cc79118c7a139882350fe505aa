btrfs: directly call into crypto framework for checksumming

Currently btrfs_csum_data() relied on the crc32c() wrapper around the
crypto framework for calculating the CRCs.

As we have our own crypto_shash structure in the fs_info now, we can
directly call into the crypto framework without going trough the wrapper.

This way we can even remove the btrfs_csum_data() and btrfs_csum_final()
wrappers.

The module dependency on crc32c is preserved via MODULE_SOFTDEP("pre:
crc32c"), which was previously provided by LIBCRC32C config option doing
the same.
