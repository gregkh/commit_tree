ABI: fix some syntax issues at the ABI database

On those three files, the ABI representation described at
README are violated.

- at sysfs-bus-iio-proximity-as3935:
	a ':' character is missing after "What"

- at sysfs-class-devfreq:
	there's a typo at Description

- at sysfs-class-cxl, it is using the ":" character at a
	file preamble, causing it to be misinterpreted as a
	tag.

- On the other files, instead of "What", they use "Where".
