net/mlx5: E-Switch, Tag packet with vport number in VF vports and uplink ingress ACLs

When a dual-port VHCA sends a RoCE packet on its non-native port, and the
packet arrives to its affiliated vport FDB, a mismatch might occur on the
rules that match the packet source vport as it is not represented by single
VHCA only in this case. So we change to match on metadata instead of source
vport.
To do that, a rule is created in all vports and uplink ingress ACLs, to
save the source vport number and vhca id in the packet's metadata in order
to match on it later.
The metadata register used is the first of the 32-bit type C registers. It
can be used for matching and header modify operations. The higher 16 bits
of this register are for vhca id, and the lower 16 ones is for vport
number.
This change is not for dual-port RoCE only. If HW and FW allow, the vport
metadata matching is enabled by default.
