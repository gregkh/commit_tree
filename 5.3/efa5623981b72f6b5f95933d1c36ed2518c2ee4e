pinctrl: aspeed: Split out pinmux from general pinctrl

ASPEED have completely rearranged the System Control Unit register
layout with the AST2600. The existing code took advantage of the fact
that the AST2400 and AST2500 had layouts that were similar enough to
have little impact on the pinmux infrastructure (though there is a wart
with read-modify-write vs write-1-clear semantics of the hardware
strapping registers between the two).

Given that any similarity has been thrown out with the AST2600, separate
out the function applying an expression state to be driver-specific.
With it, extract out the pinmux macro jungle to its own header and
implementation so the pieces can be composed without dependency cycles.
