drm/amdgpu: Split gpu_info_soc_bounding_box out from amdgpu_ucode.h

DC needs to include the soc bounding box when initializing HW resources.

Including amdgpu_ucode.h directly will cause warnings, since amdgpu.h is
required to define amdgpu_device. The solution here is to split the
bounding box structs into a different header, then include it in both
amdgpu_ucode.h, and relevant DC HW resource files.
