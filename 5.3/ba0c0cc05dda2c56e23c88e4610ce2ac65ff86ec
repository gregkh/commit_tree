selftests/bpf: convert test_cgrp2_attach2 example into kselftest

Convert test_cgrp2_attach2 example into a proper test_cgroup_attach
kselftest. It's better because we do run kselftest on a constant
basis, so there are better chances to spot a potential regression.

Also make it slightly less verbose to conform kselftests output style.

Output example:
  $ ./test_cgroup_attach
  #override:PASS
  #multi:PASS
  test_cgroup_attach:PASS
