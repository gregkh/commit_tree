crypto: arc4 - remove cipher implementation

There are no remaining users of the cipher implementation, and there
are no meaningful ways in which the arc4 cipher can be combined with
templates other than ECB (and the way we do provide that combination
is highly dubious to begin with).

So let's drop the arc4 cipher altogether, and only keep the ecb(arc4)
skcipher, which is used in various places in the kernel.
