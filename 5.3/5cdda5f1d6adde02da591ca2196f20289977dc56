ipv4: enable route flushing in network namespaces

Tools such as vpnc try to flush routes when run inside network
namespaces by writing 1 into /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush. This
currently does not work because flush is not enabled in non-initial
network namespaces.
Since routes are per network namespace it is safe to enable
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush in there.
