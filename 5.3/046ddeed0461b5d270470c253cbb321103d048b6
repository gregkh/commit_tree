KVM: Check preempted_in_kernel for involuntary preemption

preempted_in_kernel is updated in preempt_notifier when involuntary preemption
ocurrs, it can be stale when the voluntarily preempted vCPUs are taken into
account by kvm_vcpu_on_spin() loop. This patch lets it just check preempted_in_kernel
for involuntary preemption.
