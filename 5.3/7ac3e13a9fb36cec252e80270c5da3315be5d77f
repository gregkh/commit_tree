staging: kpc2000: kpc_i2c: fixup block comment style in i2c_driver.c

Throughout i2c_driver.c, there are numerous deviations from the two
standards of:
	- placing a '*' at the beginning of every line containing a
	  block comment.
	- placing the closing comment marker '*/' on a new line.

Instead, use a block comment style that is more consistent with the
prescribed guidelines.
