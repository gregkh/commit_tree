Revert "i2c: imx: improve the error handling in i2c_imx_dma_request()"

Since commit e1ab9a468e3b ("i2c: imx: improve the error handling in
i2c_imx_dma_request()") when booting with the DMA driver as module (such
as CONFIG_FSL_EDMA=m) the following endless clk warnings are seen:

This endless clk warnings behaviour is well explained by Andrey Smirnov:

"Allocating DMA after registering I2C adapter can lead to infinite
probing loop, for example, consider the following scenario:

    1. i2c_imx_probe() is called and successfully registers an I2C
       adapter via i2c_add_numbered_adapter()

    2. As a part of i2c_add_numbered_adapter() new I2C slave devices
       are added from DT which results in a call to
       driver_deferred_probe_trigger()

    3. i2c_imx_probe() continues and calls i2c_imx_dma_request() which
       due to lack of proper DMA driver returns -EPROBE_DEFER

    4. i2c_imx_probe() fails, removes I2C adapter and returns
       -EPROBE_DEFER, which places it into deferred probe list

    5. Deferred probe work triggered in #2 above kicks in and calls
       i2c_imx_probe() again thus bringing us to step #1"

So revert commit e1ab9a468e3b ("i2c: imx: improve the error handling in
i2c_imx_dma_request()") and restore the old behaviour, in order to
avoid regressions on existing setups.
