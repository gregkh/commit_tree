serial: stm32: add support of RX FIFO threshold

Adds the support of RX FIFO threshold in order to improve the RX FIFO
management.
This is done by enabling fifo threshold interrupt, instead of relying
on rx empty/fifo not full irq. That basically generates one irq/char
currently. With this patch:
- RXCFG is set to half fifo size (e.g. 16/2 = 8 data for a 16 data depth
  FIFO)
- irq rate may be reduced by up to 1/RXCFG,  e.g. 1 over 8 with current
  RXCFG setting.
- Receiver timeout is used to gather chars when FIFO threshold isn't
  reached.
