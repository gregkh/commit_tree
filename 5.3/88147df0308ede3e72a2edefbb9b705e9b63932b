drm/amd/display: fix calculation of total_data_read_bandwidth

[why]
by adding fast_validate flag, we are skipping some portion of
dcn_validate_bandwidth code that is not necessary for mode validation.
However we have a bug where it does not calculate
v->total_data_read_bandwidth, which is one of the factors determines the
result of the validation, and therefore report false positive during
mode validation.

[how]
add calculation of v->total_data_read_bandwidth outside of the region
that is guarded by fast_validate flag
