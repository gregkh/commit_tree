rxrpc: Use the tx-phase skb flag to simplify tracing

Use the previously-added transmit-phase skbuff private flag to simplify the
socket buffer tracing a bit.  Which phase the skbuff comes from can now be
divined from the skb rather than having to be guessed from the call state.

We can also reduce the number of rxrpc_skb_trace values by eliminating the
difference between Tx and Rx in the symbols.
