idr: introduce idr_for_each_entry_continue_ul()

Similarly, other callers of idr_get_next_ul() suffer the same
overflow bug as they don't handle it properly either.

Introduce idr_for_each_entry_continue_ul() to help these callers
iterate from a given ID.

cls_flower needs more care here because it still has overflow when
does arg->cookie++, we have to fold its nested loops into one
and remove the arg->cookie++.

Fixes: 12d6066c3b29 ("net/mlx5: Add flow counters idr")
