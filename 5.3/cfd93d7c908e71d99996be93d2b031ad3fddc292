mtd: spinand: Add support for GigaDevice GD5F1GQ4UFxxG

The GigaDevice GD5F1GQ4UFxxG SPI NAND is in current production devices
and, while it has the same logical layout as the E-series devices,
it differs in the SPI interfacing in significant ways.

This support is contingent on previous commits to:

  * Add support for two-byte device IDs
  * Define macros for page-read ops with three-byte addresses
