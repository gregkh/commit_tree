legacy_get_tree(): pass fc->user_ns to mount_capable()

guaranteed to be equal to current_user_ns() here - it has not
been changed since alloc_fs_context() (nothing in legacy
methods changes it) and since we don't have SB_SUBMOUNT,
that must've been FS_CONTEXT_FOR_MOUNT.  And in that case
we have fc->user_ns set to fc->cred->user_ns, i.e.
current_cred()->user_ns, i.e. current_user_ns()
