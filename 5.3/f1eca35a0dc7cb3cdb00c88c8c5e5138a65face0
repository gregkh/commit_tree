mm/sparsemem: introduce struct mem_section_usage

Patch series "mm: Sub-section memory hotplug support", v10.

The memory hotplug section is an arbitrary / convenient unit for memory
hotplug.  'Section-size' units have bled into the user interface
('memblock' sysfs) and can not be changed without breaking existing
userspace.  The section-size constraint, while mostly benign for typical
memory hotplug, has and continues to wreak havoc with 'device-memory'
use cases, persistent memory (pmem) in particular.  Recall that pmem
uses devm_memremap_pages(), and subsequently arch_add_memory(), to
allocate a 'struct page' memmap for pmem.  However, it does not use the
'bottom half' of memory hotplug, i.e.  never marks pmem pages online and
never exposes the userspace memblock interface for pmem.  This leaves an
opening to redress the section-size constraint.

To date, the libnvdimm subsystem has attempted to inject padding to
satisfy the internal constraints of arch_add_memory().  Beyond
complicating the code, leading to bugs [2], wasting memory, and limiting
configuration flexibility, the padding hack is broken when the platform
changes this physical memory alignment of pmem from one boot to the
next.  Device failure (intermittent or permanent) and physical
reconfiguration are events that can cause the platform firmware to
change the physical placement of pmem on a subsequent boot, and device
failure is an everyday event in a data-center.

It turns out that sections are only a hard requirement of the
user-facing interface for memory hotplug and with a bit more
infrastructure sub-section arch_add_memory() support can be added for
kernel internal usages like devm_memremap_pages().  Here is an analysis
of the current design assumptions in the current code and how they are
addressed in the new implementation:

Current design assumptions:

 - Sections that describe boot memory (early sections) are never
   unplugged / removed.

 - pfn_valid(), in the CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=y, case devolves to a
   valid_section() check

 - __add_pages() and helper routines assume all operations occur in
   PAGES_PER_SECTION units.

 - The memblock sysfs interface only comprehends full sections

New design assumptions:

 - Sections are instrumented with a sub-section bitmask to track (on
   x86) individual 2MB sub-divisions of a 128MB section.

 - Partially populated early sections can be extended with additional
   sub-sections, and those sub-sections can be removed with
   arch_remove_memory(). With this in place we no longer lose usable
   memory capacity to padding.

 - pfn_valid() is updated to look deeper than valid_section() to also
   check the active-sub-section mask. This indication is in the same
   cacheline as the valid_section() so the performance impact is
   expected to be negligible. So far the lkp robot has not reported any
   regressions.

 - Outside of the core vmemmap population routines which are replaced,
   other helper routines like shrink_{zone,pgdat}_span() are updated to
   handle the smaller granularity. Core memory hotplug routines that
   deal with online memory are not touched.

 - The existing memblock sysfs user api guarantees / assumptions are not
   touched since this capability is limited to !online
   !memblock-sysfs-accessible sections.

Meanwhile the issue reports continue to roll in from users that do not
understand when and how the 128MB constraint will bite them.  The current
implementation relied on being able to support at least one misaligned
namespace, but that immediately falls over on any moderately complex
namespace creation attempt.  Beyond the initial problem of 'System RAM'
colliding with pmem, and the unsolvable problem of physical alignment
changes, Linux is now being exposed to platforms that collide pmem ranges
with other pmem ranges by default [3].  In short, devm_memremap_pages()
has pushed the venerable section-size constraint past the breaking point,
and the simplicity of section-aligned arch_add_memory() is no longer
tenable.

These patches are exposed to the kbuild robot on a subsection-v10 branch
[4], and a preview of the unit test for this functionality is available
on the 'subsection-pending' branch of ndctl [5].

This patch (of 13):

Towards enabling memory hotplug to track partial population of a section,
introduce 'struct mem_section_usage'.

A pointer to a 'struct mem_section_usage' instance replaces the existing
pointer to a 'pageblock_flags' bitmap.  Effectively it adds one more
'unsigned long' beyond the 'pageblock_flags' (usemap) allocation to house
a new 'subsection_map' bitmap.  The new bitmap enables the memory
hot{plug,remove} implementation to act on incremental sub-divisions of a
section.

SUBSECTION_SHIFT is defined as global constant instead of per-architecture
value like SECTION_SIZE_BITS in order to allow cross-arch compatibility of
subsection users.  Specifically a common subsection size allows for the
possibility that persistent memory namespace configurations be made
compatible across architectures.

The primary motivation for this functionality is to support platforms that
mix "System RAM" and "Persistent Memory" within a single section, or
multiple PMEM ranges with different mapping lifetimes within a single
section.  The section restriction for hotplug has caused an ongoing saga
of hacks and bugs for devm_memremap_pages() users.

Beyond the fixups to teach existing paths how to retrieve the 'usemap'
from a section, and updates to usemap allocation path, there are no
expected behavior changes.
