ALSA: pcm: oss: Use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(struct rate_priv) + src_format->channels * sizeof(struct rate_channel)

with:

struct_size(data, channels, src_format->channels)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
