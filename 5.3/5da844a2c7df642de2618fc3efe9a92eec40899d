ocfs2: add first lock wait time in locking_state

ocfs2 file system uses locking_state file under debugfs to dump each
ocfs2 file system's dlm lock resources, but the users ever encountered
some hang(deadlock) problems in ocfs2 file system.  I'd like to add
first lock wait time in locking_state file, which can help the upper
scripts detect these deadlock problems via comparing the first lock wait
time with the current time.
