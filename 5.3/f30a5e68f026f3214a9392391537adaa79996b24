powerpc/tm: update comment about interrupt re-entrancy

Since the system reset interrupt began to use its own stack, and
machine check interrupts have done so for some time, r1 can be
changed without clearing MSR[RI], provided no other interrupts
(including SLB misses) are taken.

MSR[RI] does have to be cleared when using SCRATCH0, however.
