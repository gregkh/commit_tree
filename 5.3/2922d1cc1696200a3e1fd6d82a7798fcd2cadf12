spi: gpio: Add SPI_MASTER_GPIO_SS flag

The GPIO SPI master has some code in its local CS
callback to set the initial sck GPIO value. This was
lost in the commit converting it to use SPI core
GPIO handling as this callback isn't called if the
internal GPIO handling is active.

Add the special SPI_MASTER_GPIO_SS to ascertain it
gets called anyway so we get the initial SCK setting
right. There is some platform provided GPIO handling
there as well but this will be skipped as the cs_gpios
will be NULL.

My test targets seem not to care about the initial
SCK value so I am uncertain if this is a regression,
but to preserve the previous semantic we better do
this.
