vfs: remove redundant checks from generic_remap_checks()

The access limit checks on input file range in generic_remap_checks()
are redundant because the input file size is guaranteed to be within
limits and pos+len are already checked to be within input file size.

Beyond the fact that the check cannot fail, if it would have failed,
it could return -EFBIG for input file range error. There is no precedent
for that. -EFBIG is returned in syscalls that would change file length.

With that call removed, we can fold generic_access_check_limits() into
generic_write_check_limits().
