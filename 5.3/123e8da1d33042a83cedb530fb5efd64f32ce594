xsk: Change the default frame size to 4096 and allow controlling it

The typical XDP memory scheme is one packet per page. Change the AF_XDP
frame size in libbpf to 4096, which is the page size on x86, to allow
libbpf to be used with the drivers with the packet-per-page scheme.

Add a command line option -f to xdpsock to allow to specify a custom
frame size.
