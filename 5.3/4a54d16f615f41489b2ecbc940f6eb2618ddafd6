dma-mapping: truncate dma masks to what dma_addr_t can hold

The dma masks in struct device are always 64-bits wide.  But for builds
using a 32-bit dma_addr_t we need to ensure we don't store an
unsupportable value.  Before Linux 5.0 this was handled at least by
the ARM dma mapping code by never allowing to set a larger dma_mask,
but these days we allow the driver to just set the largest supported
value and never fall back to a smaller one.  Ensure this always works
by truncating the value.
