mm/z3fold: don't try to use buddy slots after free

As reported by Henry Burns:

Running z3fold stress testing with address sanitization showed zhdr->slots
was being used after it was freed.

  z3fold_free(z3fold_pool, handle)
    free_handle(handle)
      kmem_cache_free(pool->c_handle, zhdr->slots)
    release_z3fold_page_locked_list(kref)
      __release_z3fold_page(zhdr, true)
        zhdr_to_pool(zhdr)
          slots_to_pool(zhdr->slots)  *BOOM*

To fix this, add pointer to the pool back to z3fold_header and modify
zhdr_to_pool to return zhdr->pool.
