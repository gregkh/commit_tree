blk-throttle: fix zero wait time for iops throttled group

After commit 991f61fe7e1d ("Blk-throttle: reduce tail io latency when
iops limit is enforced") wait time could be zero even if group is
throttled and cannot issue requests right now. As a result
throtl_select_dispatch() turns into busy-loop under irq-safe queue
spinlock.

Fix is simple: always round up target time to the next throttle slice.
