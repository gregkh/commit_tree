media: aspeed: add a workaround to fix a silicon bug

AST2500 silicon revision A1 and A2 have a silicon bug which causes
extremly long capturing time on specific resolutions (1680 width).
To fix the bug, this commit adjusts the capturing window register
setting to 1728 if detected width is 1680. The compression window
register setting will be kept as the original width so output
result will be the same.
