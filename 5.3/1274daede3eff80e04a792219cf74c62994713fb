net: mvpp2: cls: Add steering based on vlan Id and priority.

This commit allows using the vlan Id and priority as parts of the key
for classification offload. These fields are extracted from the
outermost tag, if multiple tags are present.

Vlan Id and priority are considered as 2 different fields by the
classifier, however the fields are both appended in the Header Extracted
Key in the same layout as they are found in the tags. This means that
when steering only based on the prio, a 16-bit slot is still taken in
the HEK.

The classifier doesn't allow extracting the DEI bit from the tag, so we
explicitly prevent user from using this bit in the key.

This commit adds the vlan priotity as a compatible HEK field for
tagged traffic, meaning that we limit the possibility of extracting this
field only to the flows that contain tagged traffic.
