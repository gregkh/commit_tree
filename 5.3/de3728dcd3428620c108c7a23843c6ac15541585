staging: erofs: don't check special inode layout

Currently, we will check if inode layout is compression or inline if
the inode is special in fill_inode(). Also set ->i_mapping->a_ops for
it. That is pointless since the both modes won't be set for special
inode when creating EROFS filesystem image. So, let's avoid it.
