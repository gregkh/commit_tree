net: hns3: delay setting of reset level for hw errors until slot_reset is called

Presently the error handling code sets the reset level required
for the recovery of the hw errors to the reset framework in the
error_detected AER callback. However the rest_event would be
called later from the slot_reset callback. This can cause issue
of using the wrong reset_level if a high priority reset request
occur before the slot_reset is called.

This patch delays setting of the reset level, required
for the hw errors, to the reset framework until the
slot_reset is called.
