locking/lockdep: Rename lockdep_assert_held_exclusive() -> lockdep_assert_held_write()

All callers of lockdep_assert_held_exclusive() use it to verify the
correct locking state of either a semaphore (ldisc_sem in tty,
mmap_sem for perf events, i_rwsem of inode for dax) or rwlock by
apparmor. Thus it makes sense to rename _exclusive to _write since
that's the semantics callers care. Additionally there is already
lockdep_assert_held_read(), which this new naming is more consistent with.

No functional changes.
