tools/memory-model: Change definition of rcu-fence

The rcu-fence relation in the Linux Kernel Memory Model is not well
named.  It doesn't act like any other fence relation, in that it does
not relate events before a fence to events after that fence.  All it
does is relate certain RCU events to one another (those that are
ordered by the RCU Guarantee); this induces an actual
strong-fence-like relation linking events preceding the first RCU
event to those following the second.

This patch renames rcu-fence, now called rcu-order.  It adds a new
definition of rcu-fence, something which should have been present all
along because it is used in the rb relation.  And it modifies the
fence and strong-fence relations by making them incorporate the new
rcu-fence.

As a result of this change, there is no longer any need to define
full-fence in the section for detecting data races.  It can simply be
replaced by the updated strong-fence relation.

This change should have no effect on the operation of the memory model.
