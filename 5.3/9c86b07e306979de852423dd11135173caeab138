net/mlx5: Added fw version query command

Using the MCQI and MCQS registers, we query the running and pending
fw version of the HCA.
The MCQS is queried with sequentially increasing component index, until
a component of type BOOT_IMG is found. Querying this component's version
using the MCQI register yields the running and pending fw version of the
HCA.

Querying MCQI for the pending fw version should be done only after
validating that such fw version exists. This is done my checking
'component update state' field in MCQS output.
