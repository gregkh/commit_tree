net: stmmac: Fix possible deadlock when disabling EEE support

When stmmac_eee_init() is called to disable EEE support, then the timer
for EEE support is stopped and we return from the function. Prior to
stopping the timer, a mutex was acquired but in this case it is never
released and so could cause a deadlock. Fix this by releasing the mutex
prior to returning from stmmax_eee_init() when stopping the EEE timer.
