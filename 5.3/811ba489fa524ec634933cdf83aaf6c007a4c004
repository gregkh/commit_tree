regulator: of: Add of_node_put() before return in function

The local variable search in regulator_of_get_init_node takes the value
returned by either of_get_child_by_name or of_node_get, both of which
get a node. If this node is not put before returning, it could cause a
memory leak. Hence put search before a mid-loop return statement.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
