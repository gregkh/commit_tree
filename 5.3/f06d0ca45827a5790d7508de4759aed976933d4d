linux/dim: Fix overflow in dim calculation

While using net_dim, a dim_sample was used without ever initializing the
comps value. Added use of DIV_ROUND_DOWN_ULL() to prevent potential
overflow, it should not be a problem to save the final result in an int
because after the division by epms the value should not be larger than a
few thousand.

[ 1040.127124] UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in lib/dim/dim.c:78:23
[ 1040.130118] signed integer overflow:
[ 1040.131643] 134718714 * 100 cannot be represented in type 'int'
