spi: pxa2xx: Set minimum transfer speed

It is possible to request a transfer with a speed lower than supported
by the HW. This causes silent divider calculation underflow in
ssp_get_clk_div() which leads to a frequency higher than requested. Up to
maximum speed of the controller.

Set the minimum supported transfer speed and let the SPI core to
validate no transfers have speed lower than supported.
