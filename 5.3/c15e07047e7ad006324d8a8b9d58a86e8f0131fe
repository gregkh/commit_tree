scsi: lpfc: Rework misleading nvme not supported in firmware message

The driver unconditionally says fw doesn't support nvme when in
truth it was a driver parameter settings that disabled nvme support.

Rework the code validating nvme support to accurately report what
condition is disabling nvme support. Save state on whether nvme
fw supports nvme in case sysfs attributes change dynamically.
