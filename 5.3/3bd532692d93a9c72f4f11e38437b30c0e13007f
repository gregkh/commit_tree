drm/amdgpu: replace simple_strtol() by kstrtou32()

The simple_strtol() function is deprecated. kstrto[l,u32]() is
the correct replacement as it can properly handle overflows.

This patch replaces the deprecated simple_strtol() use introduced recently.
As clk is of type uint32_t, we are safe to use kstrtou32().

It is also safe to return zero on string parsing error,
similar to the case of returning zero if buf is empty in parse_clk().
