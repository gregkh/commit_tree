platform/chrome: wilco_ec: Add property helper library

A Property is typically a data item that is stored to NVRAM
by the EC. Each of these data items has an index associated
with it, known as the Property ID (PID). Properties may have
variable lengths, up to a max of WILCO_EC_PROPERTY_MAX_SIZE
bytes. Properties can be simple integers, or they may be more
complex binary data.

This patch adds support for getting and setting properties.
This will be useful for setting the charge algorithm and charge
schedules, which all use properties.
