net: phy: add callback for custom interrupt handler to struct phy_driver

The phylib interrupt handler handles link change events only currently.
However PHY drivers may want to use other interrupt sources too,
e.g. to report temperature monitoring events. Therefore add a callback
to struct phy_driver allowing PHY drivers to implement a custom
interrupt handler.
