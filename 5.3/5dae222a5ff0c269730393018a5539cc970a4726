vfs: allow copy_file_range to copy across devices

We want to enable cross-filesystem copy_file_range functionality
where possible, so push the "same superblock only" checks down to
the individual filesystem callouts so they can make their own
decisions about cross-superblock copy offload and fallack to
generic_copy_file_range() for cross-superblock copy.

[Amir] We do not call ->remap_file_range() in case the files are not
on the same sb and do not call ->copy_file_range() in case the files
do not belong to the same filesystem driver.

This changes behavior of the copy_file_range(2) syscall, which will
now allow cross filesystem in-kernel copy.  CIFS already supports
cross-superblock copy, between two shares to the same server. This
functionality will now be available via the copy_file_range(2) syscall.
