btrfs: Simplify btrfs_check_super_csum() and get rid of size assumptions

Now that we have already checked for a valid checksum type before
calling btrfs_check_super_csum(), it can be simplified even further.

While at it get rid of the implicit size assumption of the resulting
checksum as well.

This is a preparation for changing all checksum functionality to use the
crypto layer later.
