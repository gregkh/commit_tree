arm64: stacktrace: Factor out backtrace initialisation

Some common code is required by each stacktrace user to initialise
struct stackframe before the first call to unwind_frame().

In preparation for adding to the common code, this patch factors it
out into a separate function start_backtrace(), and modifies the
stacktrace callers appropriately.

No functional change.
