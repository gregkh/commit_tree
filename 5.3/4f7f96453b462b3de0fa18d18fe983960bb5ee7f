ACPI: video: Add new hw_changes_brightness quirk, set it on PB Easynote MZ35

Some machines change the brightness themselves when a brightness hotkey
gets pressed, despite us telling them not to. This causes the brightness to
go two steps up / down when the hotkey is pressed. This is esp. a problem
on older machines with only a few brightness levels.

This commit adds a new hw_changes_brightness quirk which makes
acpi_video_device_notify() only call backlight_force_update(...,
BACKLIGHT_UPDATE_HOTKEY) and not do anything else, notifying userspace
that the brightness was changed and leaving it at that fixing the dual
step problem.
