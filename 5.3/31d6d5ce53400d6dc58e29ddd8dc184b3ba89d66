vfs: Provide a mount_pseudo-replacement for the new mount API

Provide a function, init_pseudo(), that provides a common
infrastructure for converting pseudo-filesystems that can never be
mountable.

[AV: once all users of mount_pseudo_xattr() get converted, it will be folded
into pseudo_fs_get_tree()]
