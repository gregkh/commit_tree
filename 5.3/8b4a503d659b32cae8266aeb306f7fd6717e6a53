docs: s390: convert docs to ReST and rename to *.rst

Convert all text files with s390 documentation to ReST format.

Tried to preserve as much as possible the original document
format. Still, some of the files required some work in order
for it to be visible on both plain text and after converted
to html.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
