x86/kexec: Set the C-bit in the identity map page table when SEV is active

When SEV is active, the second kernel image is loaded into encrypted
memory. For that, make sure that when kexec builds the identity mapping
page table, the memory is encrypted (i.e., _PAGE_ENC is set).

 [ bp: Sort local args and OR in _PAGE_ENC for more clarity. ]
