dmaengine: rcar-dmac: Fix DMACHCLR handling if iommu is mapped

The commit 20c169aceb45 ("dmaengine: rcar-dmac: clear pertinence
number of channels") forgets to clear the last channel by
DMACHCLR in rcar_dmac_init() (and doesn't need to clear the first
channel) if iommu is mapped to the device. So, this patch fixes it
by using "channels_mask" bitfield.

Note that the hardware and driver don't support more than 32 bits
in DMACHCLR register anyway, so this patch should reject more than
32 channels in rcar_dmac_parse_of().
