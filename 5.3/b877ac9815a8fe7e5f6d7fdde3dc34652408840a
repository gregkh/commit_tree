xen/swiotlb: remember having called xen_create_contiguous_region()

Instead of always calling xen_destroy_contiguous_region() in case the
memory is DMA-able for the used device, do so only in case it has been
made DMA-able via xen_create_contiguous_region() before.

This will avoid a lot of xen_destroy_contiguous_region() calls for
64-bit capable devices.

As the memory in question is owned by swiotlb-xen the PG_owner_priv_1
flag of the first allocated page can be used for remembering.
