tracing: Make trace_get_fields() global

trace_get_fields() is the only way to read tracepoint fields at
run time, as their fields are defined at compile-time with macros.
Make this function visible to all users and it will be used by
trace event injection code to calculate the size of a tracepoint
entry.
