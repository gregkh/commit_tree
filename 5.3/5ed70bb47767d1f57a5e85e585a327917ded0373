fs/adfs: clean up indirect disc addresses and fragment IDs

We use a variety of different names for the indirect disc address of
the current object, use a variety of different types, and print it in
a variety of different ways. Bring some consistency to this by naming
it "indaddr", use u32 or __u32 as the type since it fits in 32-bits,
and always print it with %06x (with no leading hex prefix.)

When printing it was a directory identifer, use "dir %06x" otherwise
use "object %06x".

Do the same for fragment IDs and the parent indirect disc addresses.
