mm/gup: speed up check_and_migrate_cma_pages() on huge page

Both hugetlb and thp locate on the same migration type of pageblock, since
they are allocated from a free_list[].  Based on this fact, it is enough
to check on a single subpage to decide the migration type of the whole
huge page.  By this way, it saves (2M/4K - 1) times loop for pmd_huge on
x86, similar on other archs.

Furthermore, when executing isolate_huge_page(), it avoid taking global
hugetlb_lock many times, and meanless remove/add to the local link list
cma_page_list.
