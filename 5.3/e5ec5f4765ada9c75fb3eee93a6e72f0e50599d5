bcache: only clear BTREE_NODE_dirty bit when it is set

In bch_btree_cache_free() and btree_node_free(), BTREE_NODE_dirty is
always set no matter btree node is dirty or not. The code looks like
this,
	if (btree_node_dirty(b))
		btree_complete_write(b, btree_current_write(b));
	clear_bit(BTREE_NODE_dirty, &b->flags);

Indeed if btree_node_dirty(b) returns false, it means BTREE_NODE_dirty
bit is cleared, then it is unnecessary to clear the bit again.

This patch only clears BTREE_NODE_dirty when btree_node_dirty(b) is
true (the bit is set), to save a few CPU cycles.
