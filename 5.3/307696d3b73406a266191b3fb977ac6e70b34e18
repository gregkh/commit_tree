drm/client: Restrict the rotation check to the rotation itself

The drm_client_rotation has a check on the rotation value, but the
reflections are also stored in the same variable, and the check doesn't
take this into account.

Therefore, even though we might have a valid rotation, if we're also using
a reflection parameter, the test will fail for no particular reason.
