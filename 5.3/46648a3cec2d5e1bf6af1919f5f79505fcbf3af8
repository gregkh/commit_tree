drm/bridge: tc358767: copy the mode data, instead of storing the pointer

In tc_bridge_mode_set callback, we store the pointer to the given
drm_display_mode, and use the mode later. Storing a pointer in such a
way looks very suspicious to me, and I have observed odd issues where
the timings were apparently (at least mostly) zero.

Do a copy of the drm_display_mode instead to ensure we don't refer to
freed/modified data.
