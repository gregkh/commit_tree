arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-cheza: add initial cheza dt

This is essentialy a squash of a bunch of history of cheza dt updates
from chromium kernel, some of which were themselves squashes of history
from older chromium kernels.

I don't claim any credit other than wanting to more easily boot upstream
kernel on cheza to have an easier way to test upstream driver work ;-)
