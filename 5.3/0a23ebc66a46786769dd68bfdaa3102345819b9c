x86/boot: Use efi_setup_data for searching RSDP on kexec-ed kernels

Commit

  3a63f70bf4c3a ("x86/boot: Early parse RSDP and save it in boot_params")

broke kexec boot on EFI systems. efi_get_rsdp_addr() in the early
parsing code tries to search RSDP from the EFI tables but that will
crash because the table address is virtual when the kernel was booted by
kexec (set_virtual_address_map() has run in the first kernel and cannot
be run again in the second kernel).

In the case of kexec, the physical address of EFI tables is provided via
efi_setup_data in boot_params, which is set up by kexec(1).

Factor out the table parsing code and use different pointers depending
on whether the kernel is booted by kexec or not.
