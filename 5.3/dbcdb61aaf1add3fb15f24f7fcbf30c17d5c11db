mlxsw: spectrum_ptp: Fix validation in mlxsw_sp1_ptp_packet_finish()

Before mlxsw_sp1_ptp_packet_finish() sends the packet back, it validates
whether the corresponding port is still valid. However the condition is
incorrect: when mlxsw_sp_port == NULL, the code dereferences the port to
compare it to skb->dev.

The condition needs to check whether the port is present and skb->dev still
refers to that port (or else is NULL). If that does not hold, bail out.
Add a pair of parentheses to fix the condition.
