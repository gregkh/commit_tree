wait: add wq_has_single_sleeper helper

rq-qos sits in the io path so we want to take locks as sparingly as
possible.  To accomplish this we try not to take the waitqueue head lock
unless we are sure we need to go to sleep, and we have an optimization
to make sure that we don't starve out existing waiters.  Since we check
if there are existing waiters locklessly we need to be able to update
our view of the waitqueue list after we've added ourselves to the
waitqueue.  Accomplish this by adding this helper to see if there is
more than just ourselves on the list.
