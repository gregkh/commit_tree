cpufreq: Move the IS_ENABLED(CPU_THERMAL) macro into a stub

cpufreq_online() and cpufreq_offline() [un]register the driver as
a cooling device. This is done if the driver is flagged as a cooling
device in addition with an IS_ENABLED() check to compile out the branching
code.

Group this test in a stub function added in the cpufreq header instead
of having the IS_ENABLED() in the code.
