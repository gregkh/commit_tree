tpm: tpm_ibm_vtpm: Fix unallocated banks

The nr_allocated_banks and allocated banks are initialized as part of
tpm_chip_register. Currently, this is done as part of auto startup
function. However, some drivers, like the ibm vtpm driver, do not run
auto startup during initialization. This results in uninitialized memory
issue and causes a kernel panic during boot.

This patch moves the pcr allocation outside the auto startup function
into tpm_chip_register. This ensures that allocated banks are initialized
in any case.
