coresight: platform: add OF/APCI dependency

When neither CONFIG_OF nor CONFIG_ACPI are set, we get a harmless
build warning:

drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-platform.c:26:12: error: unused function 'coresight_alloc_conns'
      [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
static int coresight_alloc_conns(struct device *dev,
           ^
drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-platform.c:46:1: error: unused function 'coresight_find_device_by_fwnode'
      [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
coresight_find_device_by_fwnode(struct fwnode_handle *fwnode)

As the code is useless in that configuration anyway, just add
a Kconfig dependency that only allows building when at least
one of the two is set.

This should not hinder compile-testing, as CONFIG_OF can be
enabled on any architecture.
