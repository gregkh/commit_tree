block: remove the bi_phys_segments field in struct bio

We only need the number of segments in the blk-mq submission path.
Remove the field from struct bio, and return it from a variant of
blk_queue_split instead of that it can passed as an argument to
those functions that need the value.

This also means we stop recounting segments except for cloning
and partial segments.

To keep the number of arguments in this how path down remove
pointless struct request_queue arguments from any of the functions
that had it and grew a nr_segs argument.
