ixgbe: fix potential u32 overflow on shift

The u32 variable rem is being shifted using u32 arithmetic however
it is being passed to div_u64 that expects the expression to be a u64.
The 32 bit shift may potentially overflow, so cast rem to a u64 before
shifting to avoid this.  Also remove comment about overflow.
