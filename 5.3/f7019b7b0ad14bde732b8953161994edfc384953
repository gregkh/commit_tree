xsk: Properly terminate assignment in xskq_produce_flush_desc

Clang warns:

In file included from net/xdp/xsk_queue.c:10:
net/xdp/xsk_queue.h:292:2: warning: expression result unused
[-Wunused-value]
        WRITE_ONCE(q->ring->producer, q->prod_tail);
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
include/linux/compiler.h:284:6: note: expanded from macro 'WRITE_ONCE'
        __u.__val;                                      \
        ~~~ ^~~~~
1 warning generated.

The q->prod_tail assignment has a comma at the end, not a semi-colon.
Fix that so clang no longer warns and everything works as expected.
