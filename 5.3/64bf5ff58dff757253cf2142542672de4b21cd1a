vfs: no fallback for ->copy_file_range

Now that we have generic_copy_file_range(), remove it as a fallback
case when offloads fail. This puts the responsibility for executing
fallbacks on the filesystems that implement ->copy_file_range and
allows us to add operational validity checks to
generic_copy_file_range().

Rework vfs_copy_file_range() to call a new do_copy_file_range()
helper to execute the copying callout, and move calls to
generic_file_copy_range() into filesystem methods where they
currently return failures.

[Amir] overlayfs is not responsible of executing the fallback.
It is the responsibility of the underlying filesystem.
