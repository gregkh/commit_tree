net: aquantia: fix out of memory condition on rx side

On embedded environments with hard memory limits it is a normal although
rare case when skb can't be allocated on rx part under high traffic.

In such OOM cases napi_complete_done() was not called.
So the napi object became in an invalid state like it is "scheduled".
Kernel do not re-schedules the poll of that napi object.

Consequently, kernel can not remove that object the system hangs on
`ifconfig down` waiting for a poll.

We are fixing this by gracefully closing napi poll routine with correct
invocation of napi_complete_done.

This was reproduced with artificially failing the allocation of skb to
simulate an "out of memory" error case and check that traffic does
not get stuck.
