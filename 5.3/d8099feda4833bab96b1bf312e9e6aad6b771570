xprtrdma: Reduce context switching due to Local Invalidation

Since commit ba69cd122ece ("xprtrdma: Remove support for FMR memory
registration"), FRWR is the only supported memory registration mode.

We can take advantage of the asynchronous nature of FRWR's LOCAL_INV
Work Requests to get rid of the completion wait by having the
LOCAL_INV completion handler take care of DMA unmapping MRs and
waking the upper layer RPC waiter.

This eliminates two context switches when local invalidation is
necessary. As a side benefit, we will no longer need the per-xprt
deferred completion work queue.
