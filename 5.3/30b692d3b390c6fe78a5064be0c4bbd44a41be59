exit: make setting exit_state consistent

Since commit b191d6491be6 ("pidfd: fix a poll race when setting exit_state")
we unconditionally set exit_state to EXIT_ZOMBIE before calling into
do_notify_parent(). This was done to eliminate a race when querying
exit_state in do_notify_pidfd().
Back then we decided to do the absolute minimal thing to fix this and
not touch the rest of the exit_notify() function where exit_state is
set.
Since this fix has not caused any issues change the setting of
exit_state to EXIT_DEAD in the autoreap case to account for the fact hat
exit_state is set to EXIT_ZOMBIE unconditionally. This fix was planned
but also explicitly requested in [1] and makes the whole code more
consistent.
