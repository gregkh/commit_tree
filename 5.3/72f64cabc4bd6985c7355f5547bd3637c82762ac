remoteproc: copy parent dma_pfn_offset for vdev

When preparing the subdevice for the vdev, also copy dma_pfn_offset
since this is used for sub device dma allocations. Without that, there
is incoherency between the parent dma settings and the childs one,
potentially leading to dma_alloc_coherent failure (due to phys_to_dma
using dma_pfn_offset for translation).
