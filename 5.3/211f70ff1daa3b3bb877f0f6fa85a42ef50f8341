scsi: virtio_scsi: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct virtio_scsi {
	...
        struct virtio_scsi_vq req_vqs[];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*vscsi) + sizeof(vscsi->req_vqs[0]) * num_queues

with:

struct_size(vscsi, req_vqs, num_queues)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
