ASoC: rsnd: fixup mod ID calculation in rsnd_ctu_probe_

commit c16015f36cc1 ("ASoC: rsnd: add .get_id/.get_id_sub")
introduces rsnd_ctu_id which calcualates and gives
the main Device id of the CTU by dividing the id by 4.
rsnd_mod_id uses this interface to get the CTU main
Device id. But this commit forgets to revert the main
Device id calcution previously done in rsnd_ctu_probe_
which also divides the id by 4. This path corrects the
same to get the correct main Device id.

The issue is observered when rsnd_ctu_probe_ is done for CTU1

Fixes: c16015f36cc1 ("ASoC: rsnd: add .get_id/.get_id_sub")
