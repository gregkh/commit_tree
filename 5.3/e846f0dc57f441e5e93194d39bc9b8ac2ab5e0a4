kbuild: add support for ensuring headers are self-contained

Sometimes it's useful to be able to explicitly ensure certain headers
remain self-contained, i.e. that they are compilable as standalone
units, by including and/or forward declaring everything they depend on.

Add special target header-test-y where individual Makefiles can add
headers to be tested if CONFIG_HEADER_TEST is enabled. This will
generate a dummy C file per header that gets built as part of extra-y.
