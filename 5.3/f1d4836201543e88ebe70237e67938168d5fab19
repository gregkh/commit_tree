arm64/efi: fix variable 'si' set but not used

GCC throws out this warning on arm64.

drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/arm-stub.c: In function 'efi_entry':
drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/arm-stub.c:132:22: warning: variable 'si'
set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Fix it by making free_screen_info() a static inline function.
