drm/virtio: set seqno for dma-fence

This is motivated by having meaningful ftrace events, but it also
fixes use cases where dma_fence_is_later is called, such as in
sync_file_merge.

In other drivers, fence creation and cmdbuf submission normally
happen atomically,

  mutex_lock();
  fence = dma_fence_create(..., ++timeline->seqno);
  submit_cmdbuf();
  mutex_unlock();

and have no such issue.  But in our driver, because most ioctls
queue commands into ctrlq, we do not want to grab a lock.  Instead,
we set seqno to 0 when a fence is created, and update it when the
command is finally queued and the seqno is known.
