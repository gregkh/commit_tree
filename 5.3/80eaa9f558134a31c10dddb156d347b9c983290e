iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Link IOMMUs and devices in sysfs

As of commit 7af9a5fdb9e0ca33 ("iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Use
iommu_device_sysfs_add()/remove()"), IOMMU devices show up under
/sys/class/iommu/, but their "devices" subdirectories are empty.
Likewise, devices tied to an IOMMU do not have an "iommu" backlink.

Make sure all links are created, on both arm32 and arm64.
