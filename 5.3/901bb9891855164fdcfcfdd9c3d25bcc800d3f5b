nl80211: require and validate vendor command policy

Require that each vendor command give a policy of its sub-attributes
in NL80211_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA, and then (stricly) check the contents,
including the NLA_F_NESTED flag that we couldn't check on the outer
layer because there we don't know yet.

It is possible to use VENDOR_CMD_RAW_DATA for raw data, but then no
nested data can be given (NLA_F_NESTED flag must be clear) and the
data is just passed as is to the command.
