ice: Add switch rules to handle LLDP packets

Add call to configure dropping egress LLDP packets in ice_vsi_setup
and remove the rule in ice_vsi_release.

Add calls to add/remove rule to route LLDP packets to default VSI when
FW LLDP engine is disabled/enabled and remove rule if applied during
ice_vsi_release.

In the function ice_add_eth_mac(), there is a line that hard codes the
filter info flag to TX. This is incorrect as this flag will be set by
the calling function that built the list of filters to add. So remove
the hard coded value.

This patch also contains a fix to stop treating the DCBx state of
"Not Started" as an error state that kicks DCB in SW mode. This will
address having non-cabled interfaces automatically go into SW mode
with the FW engine running.
