Input: gpio_keys_polled - allow specifying name of input device

Instead of hardcoding the input name to the driver name
('gpio-keys-polled'), allow specifying the name of the device via
"label" property. If the property is not present (nor name is set in
board-supplied platform data), we'll default to the old name.
