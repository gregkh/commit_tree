ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix overridden device-specific initialization

The recent change to shuffle the codec initialization procedure for
Realtek via commit 607ca3bd220f ("ALSA: hda/realtek - EAPD turn on
later") caused the silent output on some machines.  This change was
supposed to be safe, but it isn't actually; some devices have quirk
setups to override the EAPD via COEF or BTL in the additional verb
table, which is applied at the beginning of snd_hda_gen_init().  And
this EAPD setup is again overridden in alc_auto_init_amp().

For recovering from the regression, tell snd_hda_gen_init() not to
apply the verbs there by a new flag, then apply the verbs in
alc_init().
