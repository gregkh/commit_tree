sctp: not bind the socket in sctp_connect

Now when sctp_connect() is called with a wrong sa_family, it binds
to a port but doesn't set bp->port, then sctp_get_af_specific will
return NULL and sctp_connect() returns -EINVAL.

Then if sctp_bind() is called to bind to another port, the last
port it has bound will leak due to bp->port is NULL by then.

sctp_connect() doesn't need to bind ports, as later __sctp_connect
will do it if bp->port is NULL. So remove it from sctp_connect().
While at it, remove the unnecessary sockaddr.sa_family len check
as it's already done in sctp_inet_connect.
