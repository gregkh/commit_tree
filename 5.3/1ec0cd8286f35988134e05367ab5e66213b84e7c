PM: hibernate: powerpc: Expose pfn_is_nosave() prototype

The declaration for pfn_is_nosave is only available in
kernel/power/power.h. Since this function can be override in arch,
expose it globally. Having a prototype will make sure to avoid warning
(sometime treated as error with W=1) such as:

  arch/powerpc/kernel/suspend.c:18:5: error: no previous prototype for 'pfn_is_nosave' [-Werror=missing-prototypes]

This moves the declaration into a globally visible header file and add
missing include to avoid a warning on powerpc.

Also remove the duplicated prototypes since not required anymore.
