pwm: meson: Don't cache struct pwm_state internally

The PWM core already caches the "current struct pwm_state" as the
"current state of the hardware registers" inside struct pwm_device.

Drop the struct pwm_state from struct meson_pwm_channel in favour of the
struct pwm_state in struct pwm_device. While here also drop any checks
based on the pwm_state because the PWM core already takes care of this.

No functional changes intended.
