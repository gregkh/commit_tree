Revert "ALSA: firewire-lib: fix inverted node IDs for amdtp_packet events"

This reverts commit e703965a129cdd72ff74e248f8fbf0d617844527.

When creating this patch, I compared the value of src field to the
value of first byte of cip_header field (SID) in tracing event.
But in this test I used a device which has a quirk to transfer
isochronous packet with invalid SID. The original change is valid.
