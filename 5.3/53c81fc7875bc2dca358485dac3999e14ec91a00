drm/amd/display: Update link rate from DPCD 10

[WHY]
Some panels return a link rate of 0 (unknown) in DPCD 0. In this case,
an appropriate mode cannot be set, and certain panels will show
corruption as they are forced to use a mode they do not support.

[HOW]
Read DPCD 10 in the case where supported link rate from DPCD 0 is
unknown, and pass that value on to the reported link rate.
This re-introduces behaviour present in previous versions that appears
to have been accidentally removed.
