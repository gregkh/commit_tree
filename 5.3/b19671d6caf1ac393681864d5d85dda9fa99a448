ASoC: core: use component driver name as component name

fmt_single_name() uses device name to determine component name.  If
multiple components bind to the same device, the debugfs creation in
soc_init_component_debugfs() would fail due to duplicated entity
names.

Name provided by component driver is unique enough to represent each
component.  Use component driver name as the component name to avoid
name duplication.
