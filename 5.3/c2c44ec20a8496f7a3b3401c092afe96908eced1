Unbreak mount_capable()

In "consolidate the capability checks in sget_{fc,userns}())" the
wrong argument had been passed to mount_capable() by sget_fc().
That mistake had been further obscured later, when switching
mount_capable() to fs_context has moved the calculation of
bogus argument from sget_fc() to mount_capable() itself.  It
should've been fc->user_ns all along.
