pwm: meson: Add the per-channel register offsets and bits in a struct

Introduce struct meson_pwm_channel_data which contains the per-channel
offsets for the PWM register and REG_MISC_AB bits. Replace the existing
switch (pwm->hwpwm) statements with an access to the new struct.

This simplifies the code and will make it easier to implement
pwm_ops.get_state() because the switch-case which all per-channel
registers and offsets (as previously implemented in meson_pwm_enable())
doesn't have to be duplicated.

No functional changes intended.
