iwlwifi: don't unmap as page memory that was mapped as single

In order to remember how to unmap a memory (as single or
as page), we maintain a bit per Transmit Buffer (TBs) in
the meta data (structure iwl_cmd_meta).
We maintain a bitmap: 1 bit per TB.
If the TB is set, we will free the memory as a page.
This bitmap was never cleared. Fix this.
