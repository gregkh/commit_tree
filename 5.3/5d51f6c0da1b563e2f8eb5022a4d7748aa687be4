drm/komeda: Add writeback support

Komeda driver uses a individual component to describe the HW's writeback
caps, but drivers doesn't define a new structure and still uses the
existing "struct komeda_layer" to describe this new component.
The detailed changes as follow:

1. Initialize wb_layer according to HW and report it to CORE.
2. CORE exposes wb_layer as a resource to KMS by private_obj.
3. Report writeback supporting by add a wb_connector to KMS, and then
   wb_connector will take act as a component resources user,
   so the func komeda_wb_encoder_atomic_check claims komeda resources
   (scaler and wb_layer) accroding to its state configuration to the
   wb_connector. and the wb_state configuration will be validated on the
   specific component resources to see if the caps of component can
   meet the requirement of wb_connector. if not check failed.
4. Update irq_handler to notify the completion of writeback.

NOTE:
This change doesn't add scaling writeback support, that support will
be added in the future after the scaler support.

v2: Rebase
v3: Rebase and constify the d71_wb_layer_funcs
v4: Addressed Ayan's comments
