net: tls, fix sk_write_space NULL write when tx disabled

The ctx->sk_write_space pointer is only set when TLS tx mode is enabled.
When running without TX mode its a null pointer but we still set the
sk sk_write_space pointer on close().

Fix the close path to only overwrite sk->sk_write_space when the current
pointer is to the tls_write_space function indicating the tls module should
clean it up properly as well.
