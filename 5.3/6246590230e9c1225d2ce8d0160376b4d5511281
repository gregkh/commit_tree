vfio-ccw: Skip second copy of guest cp to host

We already pinned/copied/unpinned 2K (256 CCWs) of guest memory
to the host space anchored off vfio_ccw_private.  There's no need
to do that again once we have the length calculated, when we could
just copy the section we need to the "permanent" space for the I/O.
