arm64: dts: armada-3720-espressobin: correct spi node

The manufacturer of this board, ships it with various SPI NOR chips and
increments U-Boot bootloader version along the time. There is no way to
tell which is placed on the board since no revision bump takes place.
This creates two issues.

The first, cosmetic. Since the NOR chip may differ, there's message on
boot stating that kernel expected w25q32dw and found different one. To
correct this, remove optional device-specific compatible string. Being
here lets replace bogus "spi-flash" compatible string with proper one.

The second is linked to partitions layout, it changed after commit:
81e7251252 ("arm64: mvebu: config: move env to the end of the 4MB boot
device") in Marvells downstream U-Boot fork [1], shifting environment
location to the end of boot device. Since the new boards will have U-Boot
with this change, it'll lead to improper results writing or reading from
these partitions. We can't tell if users will update bootloader to recent
version provided on manufacturer website, so lets drop partitons layout.
