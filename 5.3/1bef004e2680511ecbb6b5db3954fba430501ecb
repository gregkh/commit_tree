clk: fixed-factor: Add CLK_FIXED_FACTOR_HWS which takes list of struct clk_hw *

With the new clk parenting code, clk_init_data was expanded to include
.parent_hws, for clk drivers to directly reference parents by clk_hw.

Add a new macro, CLK_FIXED_FACTOR_HWS, that can take an array of pointers
to struct clk_hw, instead of a string, as its parent. Taking an array
instead of a direct pointer allows the reuse of the array for multiple
clks, rather than having one compound literal with the same contents
allocated for each clk declaration.
