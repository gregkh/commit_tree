usb: gadget: f_fs: data_len used before properly set

The following line of code in function ffs_epfile_io is trying to set
flag io_data->use_sg in case buffer required is larger than one page.

    io_data->use_sg = gadget->sg_supported && data_len > PAGE_SIZE;

However at this point of time the variable data_len has not been set
to the proper buffer size yet. The consequence is that io_data->use_sg
is always set regardless what buffer size really is, because the condition
(data_len > PAGE_SIZE) is effectively an unsigned comparison between
-EINVAL and PAGE_SIZE which would always result in TRUE.
