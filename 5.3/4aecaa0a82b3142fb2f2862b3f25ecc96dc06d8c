ASoC: fsl_asrc: replace the process_option table with function

When we want to support more sample rate, for example 12kHz/24kHz
we need update the process_option table, if we want to support more
sample rate next time, the table need to be updated again. which
is not flexible.

We got a function fsl_asrc_sel_proc to replace the table, which can
give the pre-processing and post-processing options according to
the sample rate.
