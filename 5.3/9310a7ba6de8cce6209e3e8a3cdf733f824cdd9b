io_uring: track io length in async_list based on bytes

We are using PAGE_SIZE as the unit to determine if the total len in
async_list has exceeded max_pages, it's not fair for smaller io sizes.
For example, if we are doing 1k-size io streams, we will never exceed
max_pages since len >>= PAGE_SHIFT always gets zero. So use original
bytes to make it more accurate.
