drm/amd/display: return 'NULL' instead of 'false' from dcn20_acquire_idle_pipe_for_layer

clang complains that 'false' is a not a pointer:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn20/dcn20_resource.c:2428:10: error: expression which evaluates to zero treated as a null pointer constant of type 'struct pipe_ctx *' [-Werror,-Wnon-literal-null-conversion]
                return false;

Changing it to 'NULL' looks like the right thing that will shut up
the warning and make it easier to read, while not changing behavior.
