drm/i915: Only reschedule the submission tasklet if preemption is possible

If we couple the scheduler more tightly with the execlists policy, we
can apply the preemption policy to the question of whether we need to
kick the tasklet at all for this priority bump.

v2: Rephrase it as a core i915 policy and not an execlists foible.
v3: Pull the kick together.
