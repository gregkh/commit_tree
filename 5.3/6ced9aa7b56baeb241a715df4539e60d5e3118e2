coda: stop using 'struct timespec' in user API

We exchange file timestamps with user space using psdev device
read/write operations with a fixed but architecture specific binary
layout.

On 32-bit systems, this uses a 'timespec' structure that is defined by
the C library to contain two 32-bit values for seconds and nanoseconds.
As we get ready for the year 2038 overflow of the 32-bit signed seconds,
the kernel now uses 64-bit timestamps internally, and user space will do
the same change by changing the 'timespec' definition in the future.

Unfortunately, this breaks the layout of the coda_vattr structure, so we
need to redefine that in terms of something that does not change.  I'm
introducing a new 'struct vtimespec' structure here that keeps the
existing layout, and the same change has to be done in the coda user
space copy of linux/coda.h before anyone can use that on a 32-bit
architecture with 64-bit time_t.

An open question is what should happen to actual times past y2038, as
they are now truncated to the last valid date when sent to user space,
and interpreted as pre-1970 times when a timestamp with the MSB set is
read back into the kernel.  Alternatively, we could change the new
timespec64_to_coda()/coda_to_timespec64() functions to use a different
interpretation and extend the available range further to the future by
disallowing past timestamps.  This would require more changes in the
user space side though.
