kbuild: remove the first line of *.mod files

The current format of *.mod is like this:

  line 1: directory path to the .ko file
  line 2: a list of objects linked into this module
  line 3: unresolved symbols (only when CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS=y)

Now that *.mod and *.ko are created in the same directory, the line 1
provides no valuable information. It can be derived by replacing the
extension .mod with .ko. In fact, nobody uses the first line any more.

Cut down the first line.
