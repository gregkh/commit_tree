hwspinlock/omap: Add support for TI K3 SoCs

A HwSpinlock IP is also present on the newer TI K3 AM65x and J721E
family of SoCs within the Main NavSS sub-module. Reuse the existing
OMAP Hwspinlock driver to extend the support for this IP on K3 AM65x
SoCs as well. The IP has slightly different bit-fields in the
SYSCONFIG and SYSSTATUS registers.
