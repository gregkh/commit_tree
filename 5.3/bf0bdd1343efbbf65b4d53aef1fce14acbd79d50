xdp: fix race on generic receive path

Unlike driver mode, generic xdp receive could be triggered
by different threads on different CPU cores at the same time
leading to the fill and rx queue breakage. For example, this
could happen while sending packets from two processes to the
first interface of veth pair while the second part of it is
open with AF_XDP socket.

Need to take a lock for each generic receive to avoid race.
