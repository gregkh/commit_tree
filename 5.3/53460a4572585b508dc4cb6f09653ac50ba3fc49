btrfs: trim: make reserved device area adjustments more explicit

Currently the first megabyte on a device housing a btrfs filesystem is
exempt from allocation and trimming. Currently this is not a problem
since 'start' is set to 1M at the beginning of btrfs_trim_free_extents
and find_first_clear_extent_bit always returns a range that is >= start.

However, in a follow up patch find_first_clear_extent_bit will be
changed such that it will return a range containing 'start' and this
range may very well be 0...>=1M so 'start'.

Future proof the sole user of find_first_clear_extent_bit by setting
'start' after the function is called. No functional changes.
