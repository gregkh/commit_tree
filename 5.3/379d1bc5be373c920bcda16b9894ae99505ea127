xprtrdma: Simplify rpcrdma_rep_create

Clean up.

Commit 7c8d9e7c8863 ("xprtrdma: Move Receive posting to Receive
handler") reduced the number of rpcrdma_rep_create call sites to
one. After that commit, the backchannel code no longer invokes it.

Therefore the free list logic added by commit d698c4a02ee0
("xprtrdma: Fix backchannel allocation of extra rpcrdma_reps") is
no longer necessary, and in fact adds some extra overhead that we
can do without.

Simply post any newly created reps. They will get added back to
the rb_recv_bufs list when they subsequently complete.
