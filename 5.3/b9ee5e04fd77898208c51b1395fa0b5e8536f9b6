powerpc/64e: Drop stale call to smp_processor_id() which hangs SMP startup

Commit ebb9d30a6a74 ("powerpc/mm: any thread in one core can be the
first to setup TLB1") removed the need to know the cpu_id in
early_init_this_mmu(), but the call to smp_processor_id() which was
marked __maybe_used remained.

Since commit ed1cd6deb013 ("powerpc: Activate CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK")
thread_info cannot be reached before MMU is properly set up.

Drop this stale call to smp_processor_id() which makes SMP hang when
CONFIG_PREEMPT is set.

Fixes: ebb9d30a6a74 ("powerpc/mm: any thread in one core can be the first to setup TLB1")
Fixes: ed1cd6deb013 ("powerpc: Activate CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK")
