drm/amdgpu: support userptr cross VMAs case with HMM

userptr may cross two VMAs if the forked child process (not call exec
after fork) malloc buffer, then free it, and then malloc larger size
buf, kerenl will create new VMA adjacent to old VMA which was cloned
from parent process, some pages of userptr are in the first VMA, the
rest pages are in the second VMA.

HMM expects range only have one VMA, loop over all VMAs in the address
range, create multiple ranges to handle this case. See
is_mergeable_anon_vma in mm/mmap.c for details.
