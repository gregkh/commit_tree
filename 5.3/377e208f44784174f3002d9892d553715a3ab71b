ubifs: Correctly initialize c->min_log_bytes

Currently on a freshly mounted UBIFS, c->min_log_bytes is 0.
This can lead to a log overrun and make commits fail.

Recent kernels will report the following assert:
UBIFS assert failed: c->lhead_lnum != c->ltail_lnum, in fs/ubifs/log.c:412

c->min_log_bytes can have two states, 0 and c->leb_size.
It controls how much bytes of the log area are reserved for non-bud
nodes such as commit nodes.

After a commit it has to be set to c->leb_size such that we have always
enough space for a commit. While a commit runs it can be 0 to make the
remaining bytes of the log available to writers.

Having it set to 0 right after mount is wrong since no space for commits
is reserved.
