staging: erofs: add compacted compression indexes support

This patch aims at compacted compression indexes:
 1) cleanup z_erofs_map_blocks_iter and move into zmap.c;
 2) add compacted 4/2B decoding support.

On kirin980 platform, sequential read is increased about
6% (725MiB/s -> 770MiB/s) on enwik9 dataset if compacted 2B
feature is enabled.
