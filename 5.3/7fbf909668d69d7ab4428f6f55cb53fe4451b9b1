ALSA: firewire-lib/fireface: fix initial value of data block counter for IR context with CIP_NO_HEADER

For IR context, ALSA IEC 61883-1/6 engine uses initial value of data
block counter as UINT_MAX, to detect first isochronous packet in the
middle of packet streaming.

At present, when CIP_NO_HEADER is used (i.e. for ALSA fireface driver),
the initial value is used for tracepoints event. 0x00 should be
for the event when the initial value is UINT_MAX because isochronous
packets with CIP_NO_HEADER option has no field for data block count.

This commit fixes the bug.
