bpf: group memory related fields in struct bpf_map_memory

Group "user" and "pages" fields of bpf_map into the bpf_map_memory
structure. Later it can be extended with "memcg" and other related
information.

The main reason for a such change (beside cosmetics) is to pass
bpf_map_memory structure to charging functions before the actual
allocation of bpf_map.
