KVM: LAPIC: Delay trace_kvm_wait_lapic_expire tracepoint to after vmexit

wait_lapic_expire() call was moved above guest_enter_irqoff() because of
its tracepoint, which violated the RCU extended quiescent state invoked
by guest_enter_irqoff()[1][2]. This patch simply moves the tracepoint
below guest_exit_irqoff() in vcpu_enter_guest(). Snapshot the delta before
VM-Enter, but trace it after VM-Exit. This can help us to move
wait_lapic_expire() just before vmentry in the later patch.
