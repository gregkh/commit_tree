drm/i915/selftests: Add mock selftest for remapped vmas

Extend the rotated vma mock selftest to cover remapped vmas as
well.

TODO: reindent the loops I guess? Left like this for now to
ease review

v2: Include the vma type in the error message (Chris)
v3: Deal with trimmed sg
v4: Drop leftover debugs
