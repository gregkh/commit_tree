drm/amd/display: wait for the whole frame after global unlock

[why]
The current code will not wait for the entire frame
 after global unlock.
This causes dsc dynamic target bpp update corruption when
there is a surface update immediately happens after this.

[how]
Wait for the entire whole frame after unlock before continuing
the rest of stream and surface update.
