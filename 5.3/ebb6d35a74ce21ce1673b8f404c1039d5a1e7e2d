kasan: remove clang version check for KASAN_STACK

asan-stack mode still uses dangerously large kernel stacks of tens of
kilobytes in some drivers, and it does not seem that anyone is working
on the clang bug.

Turn it off for all clang versions to prevent users from accidentally
enabling it once they update to clang-9, and to help automated build
testing with clang-9.
