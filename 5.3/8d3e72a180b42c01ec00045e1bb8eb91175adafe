iomap: don't mark the inode dirty in iomap_write_end

Marking the inode dirty for each page copied into the page cache can be
very inefficient for file systems that use the VFS dirty inode tracking,
and is completely pointless for those that don't use the VFS dirty inode
tracking.  So instead, only set an iomap flag when changing the in-core
inode size, and open code the rest of __generic_write_end.

Partially based on code from Christoph Hellwig.
