KVM: VMX: simplify vmx_prepare_switch_to_{guest,host}

vmx->loaded_cpu_state can only be NULL or equal to vmx->loaded_vmcs,
so change it to a bool.  Because the direction of the bool is
now the opposite of vmx->guest_msrs_dirty, change the direction of
vmx->guest_msrs_dirty so that they match.

Finally, do not imply that MSRs have to be reloaded when
vmx->guest_state_loaded is false; instead, set vmx->guest_msrs_ready
to false explicitly in vmx_prepare_switch_to_host.
