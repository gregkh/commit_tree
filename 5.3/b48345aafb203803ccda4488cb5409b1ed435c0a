audit: deliver signal_info regarless of syscall

When a process signals the audit daemon (shutdown, rotate, resume,
reconfig) but syscall auditing is not enabled, we still want to know the
identity of the process sending the signal to the audit daemon.

Move audit_signal_info() out of syscall auditing to general auditing but
create a new function audit_signal_info_syscall() to take care of the
syscall dependent parts for when syscall auditing is enabled.
