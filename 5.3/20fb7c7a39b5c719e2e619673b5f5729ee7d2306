net: myri10ge: fix memory leaks

In myri10ge_probe(), myri10ge_alloc_slices() is invoked to allocate slices
related structures. Later on, myri10ge_request_irq() is used to get an irq.
However, if this process fails, the allocated slices related structures are
not deallocated, leading to memory leaks. To fix this issue, revise the
target label of the goto statement to 'abort_with_slices'.
