net: sched: act_sample: fix psample group handling on overwrite

Action sample doesn't properly handle psample_group pointer in overwrite
case. Following issues need to be fixed:

- In tcf_sample_init() function RCU_INIT_POINTER() is used to set
  s->psample_group, even though we neither setting the pointer to NULL, nor
  preventing concurrent readers from accessing the pointer in some way.
  Use rcu_swap_protected() instead to safely reset the pointer.

- Old value of s->psample_group is not released or deallocated in any way,
  which results resource leak. Use psample_group_put() on non-NULL value
  obtained with rcu_swap_protected().

- The function psample_group_put() that released reference to struct
  psample_group pointed by rcu-pointer s->psample_group doesn't respect rcu
  grace period when deallocating it. Extend struct psample_group with rcu
  head and use kfree_rcu when freeing it.
