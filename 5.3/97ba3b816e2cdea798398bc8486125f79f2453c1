bcache: acquire bch_register_lock later in cached_dev_detach_finish()

Now there is variable bcache_is_reboot to prevent device register or
unregister during reboot, it is unncessary to still hold mutex lock
bch_register_lock before stopping writeback_rate_update kworker and
writeback kthread. And if the stopping kworker or kthread holding
bch_register_lock inside their routine (we used to have such problem
in writeback thread, thanks to Junhui Wang fixed it), it is very easy
to introduce deadlock during reboot/shutdown procedure.

Therefore in this patch, the location to acquire bch_register_lock is
moved to the location before calling calc_cached_dev_sectors(). Which
is later then original location in cached_dev_detach_finish().
