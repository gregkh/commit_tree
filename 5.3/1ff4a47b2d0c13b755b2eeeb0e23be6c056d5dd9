perf/x86/intel/uncore: Support multi-die/package

Uncore becomes die-scope on Xeon Cascade Lake-AP. Uncore driver needs to
support die-scope uncore units.

Use topology_logical_die_id() to replace topology_logical_package_id().
For previous platforms which doesn't have multi-die,
topology_logical_die_id() is identical as topology_logical_package_id().

In pci_probe()/remove(), the group id reads from PCI BUS is logical die id
for multi-die systems.

Use topology_die_cpumask() to replace topology_core_cpumask().
For previous platforms which doesn't have multi-die,
topology_die_cpumask() is identical as topology_core_cpumask().

There is no functional change for previous platforms.
