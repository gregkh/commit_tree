blk-iolatency: only account submitted bios

As is, iolatency recognizes done_bio and cleanup as ending paths. If a
request is marked REQ_NOWAIT and fails to get a request, the bio is
cleaned up via rq_qos_cleanup() and ended in bio_wouldblock_error().
This results in underflowing the inflight counter. Fix this by only
accounting bios that were actually submitted.
