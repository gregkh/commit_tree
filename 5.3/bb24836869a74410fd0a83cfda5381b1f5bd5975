drm/bridge: tc358767: move PXL PLL enable/disable to stream enable/disable

We set up the PXL PLL inside tc_main_link_setup. This is unnecessary,
and makes tc_main_link_setup depend on the video-mode, which should not
be the case. As PXL PLL is used only for the video stream (and only when
using the HW test pattern), let's move the PXL PLL setup into
tc_stream_enable.

Also, currently the PXL PLL is only disabled if the driver if removed.
Let's disable the PXL PLL when the stream is disabled.
