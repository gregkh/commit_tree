ixgbe: Check DDM existence in transceiver before access

Some transceivers may comply with SFF-8472 but not implement the Digital
Diagnostic Monitoring (DDM) interface described in it. The existence of
such area is specified by bit 6 of byte 92, set to 1 if implemented.

Currently, due to not checking this bit ixgbe fails trying to read SFP
module's eeprom with the follow message:

ethtool -m enP51p1s0f0
Cannot get Module EEPROM data: Input/output error

Because it fails to read the additional 256 bytes in which it was assumed
to exist the DDM data.

This issue was noticed using a Mellanox Passive DAC PN 01FT738. The eeprom
data was confirmed by Mellanox as correct and present in other Passive
DACs in from other manufacturers.
