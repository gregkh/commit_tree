ptrace: move clearing of TIF_SYSCALL_EMU flag to core

While the TIF_SYSCALL_EMU is set in ptrace_resume independent of any
architecture, currently only powerpc and x86 unset the TIF_SYSCALL_EMU
flag in ptrace_disable which gets called from ptrace_detach.

Let's move the clearing of TIF_SYSCALL_EMU flag to __ptrace_unlink
which gets executed from ptrace_detach and also keep it along with
or close to clearing of TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE.
