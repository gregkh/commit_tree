arm64: cacheinfo: Update cache_line_size detected from DT or PPTT

cache_line_size is derived from CTR_EL0.CWG field and is called mostly
for I/O device drivers. For some platforms like the HiSilicon Kunpeng920
server SoC, cache line sizes are different between L1/2 cache and L3
cache while L1 cache line size is 64-byte and L3 is 128-byte, but
CTR_EL0.CWG is misreporting using L1 cache line size.

We shall correct the right value which is important for I/O performance.
Let's update the cache line size if it is detected from DT or PPTT
information.
