drm/amd/display: make clk_mgr call enable_pme_wa

[why]
Before for raven and navi we are calling pp_smu functions for pme

[how]
refactor a code so we will call clk_mgr's enable_pme_wa function so we
can use pme_wa for future asics. This way we don't need to worry about
different ASIC since clk_mgr already have that information
