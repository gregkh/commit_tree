pinctrl: sh-pfc: emev2: Use new macros for non-GPIO pins

Update the EMMA Mobile EV2 pin control driver to use the new macros for
describing pins without GPIO functionality.  This replaces the use of
physical pin numbers on the EMMA Mobile EV2 SoC (in 23x23 BGA package)
by symbolic enum values, referring to signal names.

Note that the user-visible names of these pins are still based on pin
numbers instead of signal names, to preserve DT backwards compatibility.
