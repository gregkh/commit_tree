afs: Fix leak in afs_lookup_cell_rcu()

Fix a leak on the cell refcount in afs_lookup_cell_rcu() due to
non-clearance of the default error in the case a NULL cell name is passed
and the workstation default cell is used.

Also put a bit at the end to make sure we don't leak a cell ref if we're
going to be returning an error.

This leak results in an assertion like the following when the kafs module is
unloaded:

	AFS: Assertion failed
	2 == 1 is false
	0x2 == 0x1 is false
	------------[ cut here ]------------
	kernel BUG at fs/afs/cell.c:770!
