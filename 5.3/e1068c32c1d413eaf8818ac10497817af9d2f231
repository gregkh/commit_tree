soc: qcom: geni: Add support for ACPI

When booting with ACPI as the active set of configuration tables,
all; clocks, regulators, pin functions ect are expected to be at
their ideal values/levels/rates, thus the associated frameworks
are unavailable.  Ensure calls to these APIs are shielded when
ACPI is enabled.
