ASoC: Intel: sof-rt5682: fix undefined references with Baytrail-only support

The sof-rt5682 machine driver supports both legacy Baytrail devices
and more recent ApolloLake/CometLake platforms. When only Baytrail is
selected, the compilation fails with the following errors:

ERROR: "hdac_hdmi_jack_port_init"
[sound/soc/intel/boards/snd-soc-sof_rt5682.ko] undefined!

ERROR: "hdac_hdmi_jack_init"
[sound/soc/intel/boards/snd-soc-sof_rt5682.ko] undefined!

Fix by selecting SND_SOC_HDAC_HDMI unconditionally. The code for HDMI
support is not reachable on Baytrail so this change has no functional
impact.
