mm/vmalloc.c: get rid of one single unlink_va() when merge

It does not make sense to try to "unlink" the node that is definitely not
linked with a list nor tree.  On the first merge step VA just points to
the previously disconnected busy area.

On the second step, check if the node has been merged and do "unlink" if
so, because now it points to an object that must be linked.
