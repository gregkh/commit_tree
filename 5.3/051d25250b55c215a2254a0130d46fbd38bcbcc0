afs: Add some callback management tracepoints

Add a couple of tracepoints to track callback management:

 (1) afs_cb_miss - Logs when we were unable to apply a callback, either due
     to the inode being discarded or due to a competing thread applying a
     callback first.

 (2) afs_cb_break - Logs when we attempted to clear the noted callback
     promise, either due to the server explicitly breaking the callback,
     the callback promise lapsing or a local event obsoleting it.
