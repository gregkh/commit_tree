mei: make modules.alias UUID information easier to read

scripts/mod/file2alias.c:add_uuid()  convert UUID into a single string
which does not conform to the standard little endian UUID formatting.
This patch changes add_uuid() to output same format as %pUL and modifies
the mei driver to match the change.
