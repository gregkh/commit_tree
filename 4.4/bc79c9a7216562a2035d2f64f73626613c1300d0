ARC: dw2 unwind: Reinstante unwinding out of modules

The fix which removed linear searching of dwarf (because binary lookup
data always exists) missed out on the fact that modules don't get the
binary lookup tables info. This caused unwinding out of modules to stop
working.

So add binary lookup header setup (equivalent of eh_frame_hdr setup) to
modules as well.

While at it, confine the header setup to within unwinder code,
reducing one API exposed out of unwinder code.
