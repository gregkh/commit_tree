net/xps: Fix calculation of initial number of xps queues

The existing code breaks on architectures where the L1 cache size
(L1_CACHE_BYTES) is smaller or equal the size of struct xps_map.

The new code ensures that we get at minimum one initial xps queue, or even more
as long as it fits into the next multiple of L1_CACHE_SIZE.
