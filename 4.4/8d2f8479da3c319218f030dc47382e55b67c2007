HID: roccat: Fixed resubmit: Deprecating most Roccat sysfs attributes

Deprecates all Roccat sysfs attributes except the ones for the old Kone by
moving abi descriptions from testing to obsolete.  For most devices everything
can be done using the hidraw ioctls HIDIOCGFEATURE and HIDIOCSFEATURE, so I
would suggest future removal of device specific drivers.  The userspace tools
don't use these attributes for a year now.  The first Kone is not fully
HID-compliant and will still need a module.
