btrfs: extent_io: Introduce new function set_record_extent_bits

Introduce new function set_record_extent_bits(), which will not only set
given bits, but also record how many bytes are changed, and detailed
range info.

This is quite important for later qgroup reserve framework.
The number of bytes will be used to do qgroup reserve, and detailed
range info will be used to cleanup for EQUOT case.
