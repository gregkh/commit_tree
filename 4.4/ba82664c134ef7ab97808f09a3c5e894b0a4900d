intel_th: Add Memory Storage Unit driver

Memory Storage Unit (MSU) is a trace output device that collects trace
data to system memory. It consists of 2 independent Memory Storage
Controllers (MSCs).

This driver provides userspace interfaces to configure in-memory tracing
parameters, such as contiguous (high-order allocation) buffer or multiblock
(scatter list) buffer mode, wrapping (data overwrite) and number and sizes
of windows in multiblock mode. Userspace can read the buffers via mmap()ing
or read()ing of the corresponding device node.
