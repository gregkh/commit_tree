openvswitch: add tunnel protocol to sw_flow_key

Store tunnel protocol (AF_INET or AF_INET6) in sw_flow_key. This field now
also acts as an indicator whether the flow contains tunnel data (this was
previously indicated by tun_key.u.ipv4.dst being set but with IPv6 addresses
in an union with IPv4 ones this won't work anymore).

The new field was added to a hole in sw_flow_key.
