ARM/arm64: KVM: correct PTE uncachedness check

Commit e6fab5442345 ("ARM/arm64: KVM: test properly for a PTE's
uncachedness") modified the logic to test whether a HYP or stage-2
mapping needs flushing, from [incorrectly] interpreting the page table
attributes to [incorrectly] checking whether the PFN that backs the
mapping is covered by host system RAM. The PFN number is part of the
output of the translation, not the input, so we have to use pte_pfn()
on the contents of the PTE, not __phys_to_pfn() on the HYP virtual
address or stage-2 intermediate physical address.
