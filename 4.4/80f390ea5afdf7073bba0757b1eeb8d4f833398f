Documentation: add DT binding for ARM System Control and Power Interface(SCPI) protocol

This patch adds devicetree binding for System Control and Power
Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol used between the Application Cores(AP)
and the System Control Processor(SCP). The MHU peripheral provides a
mechanism for inter-processor communication between SCP's M3 processor
and AP.

SCP offers control and management of the core/cluster power states,
various power domain DVFS including the core/cluster, certain system
clocks configuration, thermal sensors and many others.
