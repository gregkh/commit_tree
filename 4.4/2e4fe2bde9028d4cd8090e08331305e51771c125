staging/lustre/ptlrpc: remove LUSTRE_MSG_MAGIC_V1 support

Remove the remains of LUSTRE_MSG_MAGIC_V1 support from ptlrpc.
It has not been supported since 1.8 and is not functional since 2.0.

In lustre_msg_check_version(), return an error for unsupported RPC
versions so that the server will reject such RPCs early.  Otherwise
the server only prints an error message and continue on.
