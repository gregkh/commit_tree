xen/balloon: pre-allocate p2m entries for ballooned pages

Pages returned by alloc_xenballooned_pages() will be used for grant
mapping which will call set_phys_to_machine() (in PV guests).

Ballooned pages are set as INVALID_P2M_ENTRY in the p2m and thus may
be using the (shared) missing tables and a subsequent
set_phys_to_machine() will need to allocate new tables.

Since the grant mapping may be done from a context that cannot sleep,
the p2m entries must already be allocated.
