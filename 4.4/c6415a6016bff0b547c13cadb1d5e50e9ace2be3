crypto: caam - add support for acipher xts(aes)

Add support for AES working in XEX-based Tweaked-codebook mode with
ciphertext Stealing (XTS)

sector index - HW limitation: CAAM device supports sector index of only
8 bytes to be used for sector index inside IV, instead of whole 16 bytes
received on request. This represents 2 ^ 64 = 16,777,216 Tera of possible
values for sector index.
