debugfs: Pass bool pointer to debugfs_create_bool()

Its a bit odd that debugfs_create_bool() takes 'u32 *' as an argument,
when all it needs is a boolean pointer.

It would be better to update this API to make it accept 'bool *'
instead, as that will make it more consistent and often more convenient.
Over that bool takes just a byte.

That required updates to all user sites as well, in the same commit
updating the API. regmap core was also using
debugfs_{read|write}_file_bool(), directly and variable types were
updated for that to be bool as well.
