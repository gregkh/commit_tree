cpufreq: SCPI: Depend on SCPI clk driver

The SCPI clk driver registers the virtual cpufreq device that kicks off
initialisation of the SCPI cpufreq driver. Also, clk_get() will fail for
the cpufreq driver if the SCPI clk driver is missing.

Fix this by making the SCPI cpufreq driver explicitly depend on the SCPI
clk driver.
