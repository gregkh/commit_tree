mtd: warn when registering the same master many times

When CONFIG_MTD_PARTITIONED_MASTER=y, it is fatal to call
mtd_device_parse_register() twice on the same MTD, as we try to register
the same device/kobject multipile times.

When CONFIG_MTD_PARTITIONED_MASTER=n, calling
mtd_device_parse_register() is more of just a nuisance, as we can mostly
navigate around any conflicting actions.

But anyway, doing so is a Bad Thing (TM), and we should complain loudly
for any drivers that try to do this.
