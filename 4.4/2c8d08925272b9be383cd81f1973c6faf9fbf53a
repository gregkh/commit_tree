ALSA: maestro3: Fix Allegro mute until master volume/mute is touched

ESS Allegro (marked ES1989S), [125d:1988] (rev 10) is mute after
loading snd-maestro3 and running alsactl restore. Touching master
volume or mute makes it work.

Looks like a bug in the AC'97 codec integrated into the chip.

Write AC97_MASTER register twice to work-around the problem.
