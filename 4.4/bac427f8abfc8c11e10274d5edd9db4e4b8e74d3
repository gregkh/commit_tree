drm/i915: Prepare for GuC-based command submission

This adds the first of the data structures used to communicate with the
GuC (the pool of guc_context structures).

We create a GuC-specific wrapper round the GEM object allocator as all
GEM objects shared with the GuC must be pinned into GGTT space at an
address that is NOT in the range [0..WOPCM_TOP), as that range of GGTT
addresses is not accessible to the GuC (from the GuC's point of view,
it's permanently reserved for other objects such as the BootROM & SRAM).

Later, we will need to allocate additional GuC-sharable objects for the
submission client(s) and the GuC's debug log.

v2:
    Remove redundant initialisation [Chris Wilson]
    Defer adding struct members until needed [Chris Wilson]
    Local functions should pass dev_priv rather than dev [Chris Wilson]

v5:
    Invalidate GuC TLB after allocating and pinning a new object

v6:
    Rebased
