Btrfs: change how we wait for pending ordered extents

We have a mechanism to make sure we don't lose updates for ordered extents that
were logged in the transaction that is currently running.  We add the ordered
extent to a transaction list and then the transaction waits on all the ordered
extents in that list.  However are substantially large file systems this list
can be extremely large, and can give us soft lockups, since the ordered extents
don't remove themselves from the list when they do complete.

To fix this we simply add a counter to the transaction that is incremented any
time we have a logged extent that needs to be completed in the current
transaction.  Then when the ordered extent finally completes it decrements the
per transaction counter and wakes up the transaction if we are the last ones.
This will eliminate the softlockup.  Thanks,
