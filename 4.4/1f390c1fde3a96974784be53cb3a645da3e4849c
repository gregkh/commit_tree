nvme: temporary fix for Apple controller reset

Recent patches added basic support for the Apple NVMe controller but
still cause resets and data corruption on that particular controller
when a specific pattern of read/flush commands occurs. Limiting the
queue depth to 2 works around that issue.

This patch enforces that limit only for the Apple controller and is
considered a temporary fix until we find the root source of that
problem.
