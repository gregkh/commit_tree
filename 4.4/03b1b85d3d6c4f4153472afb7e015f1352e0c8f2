MIPS: Don't read GCRs when a CM is not present

Commit 3885c2b463f6 ("MIPS: CM: Add support for reporting CM cache
errors") leads to Malta boards unconditionally reading CM GCRs upon bus
errors, regardless of whether a CM is present. This is incorrect & will
lead to further exceptions. Fix by moving the GCR reads to after the
check for whether a CM is present.
