drivers/w1/w1_int.c: call put_device if device_register fails

Currently, memsetting and kfreeing the device is bad behaviour.  The
device will have a reference count of 1 and hence can cause trouble
because it has kfree'd.  Proper way to handle a failed device_register is
to call put_device right after it fails.
