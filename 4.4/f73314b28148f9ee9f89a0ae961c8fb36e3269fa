xen/grant-table: Add an helper to iterate over a specific number of grants

With the 64KB page granularity support on ARM64, a Linux page may be
split accross multiple grant.

Currently we have the helper gnttab_foreach_grant_in_grant to break a
Linux page based on an offset and a len, but it doesn't fit when we only
have a number of grants in hand.

Introduce a new helper which take an array of Linux page and a number of
grant and will figure out the address of each grant.
