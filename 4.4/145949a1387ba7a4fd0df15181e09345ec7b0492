mm/list_lru.c: replace nr_node_ids for loop with for_each_node()

The functions used in the patch are in slowpath, which gets called
whenever alloc_super is called during mounts.

Though this should not make difference for the architectures with
sequential numa node ids, for the powerpc which can potentially have
sparse node ids (for e.g., 4 node system having numa ids, 0,1,16,17 is
common), this patch saves some unnecessary allocations for non existing
numa nodes.

Even without that saving, perhaps patch makes code more readable.
