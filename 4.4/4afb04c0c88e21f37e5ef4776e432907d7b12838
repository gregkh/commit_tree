rbd: remove duplicate calls to rbd_dev_mapping_clear()

Commit d1cf5788450e ("rbd: set mapping info earlier") defined
rbd_dev_mapping_clear(), but, just a few days after, commit
f35a4dee14c3 ("rbd: set the mapping size and features later") moved
rbd_dev_mapping_set() calls and added another rbd_dev_mapping_clear()
call instead of moving the old one.  Around the same time, another
duplicate was introduced in rbd_dev_device_release() - kill both.
