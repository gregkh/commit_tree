Documentation: dt: keystone: provide SoC specific compatible flags

Keystone2 devices are used on more platforms than just Texas
Instruments reference evaluation platforms called EVMs. Providing a
generic compatible "ti,keystone" is not sufficient to differentiate
various SoC definitions possible on various platforms for the
following reasons:
a) Userspace applications have no way of knowing which SoC they are
functioning, providing the compatible matches provide a mechanism for
them to enable SoC specific functionality. Such userspace applications
are typically automated test framework or SoC custom hardware
acceleration entitlement from a common file system.
b) Provides an accurate hardware description. This allows
SoC specific logic to be run time handled based on
of_machine_is_compatible("ti,k2hk") or as needed for the dependent
processor instead of needing to use board dependent compatibles that
are needed now.

Hence, provide compatible matches for each SoC in the Keystone family.
