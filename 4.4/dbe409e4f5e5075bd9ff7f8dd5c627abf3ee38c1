Dmitry identified a potential memory leak in the routine region_chg,
where a region descriptor is not free'ed on an error path.

However, the root cause for the above memory leak resides in region_del.
In this specific case, a "placeholder" entry is created in region_chg.
The associated page allocation fails, and the placeholder entry is left
in the reserve map.  This is "by design" as the entry should be deleted
when the map is released.  The bug is in the region_del routine which is
used to delete entries within a specific range (and when the map is
released).  region_del did not handle the case where a placeholder entry
exactly matched the start of the range range to be deleted.  In this
case, the entry would not be deleted and leaked.  The fix is to take
these special placeholder entries into account in region_del.

The region_chg error path leak is also fixed.
