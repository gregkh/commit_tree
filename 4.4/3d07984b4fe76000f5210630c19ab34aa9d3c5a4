Revert "USB: qcserial/option: make AT URCs work for Sierra Wireless MC7305/MC7355"

This reverts commit 653cdc13a340ad1cef29f1bab0d05d0771fa1d57.

The qcserial driver now enables the SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE request
so that AT URCs will work. Move these devices back to the qcserial
driver, which is used for other devices in this series that follow
the same layout.
