Use 64-bit timekeeping

This patch changes the use of struct timespec in
dccp_probe to use struct timespec64 instead. timespec uses a 32-bit
seconds field which will overflow in the year 2038 and beyond. timespec64
uses a 64-bit seconds field. Note that the correctness of the code isn't
changed, since the original code only uses the timestamps to compute a
small elapsed interval. This patch is part of a larger attempt to remove
instances of 32-bit timekeeping structures (timespec, timeval, time_t)
from the kernel so it is easier to identify where the real 2038 issues
are.
