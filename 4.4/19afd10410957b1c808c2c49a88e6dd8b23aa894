perf stat: Reduce min --interval-print to 10ms

The --interval-print parameter was limited to 100ms. However, for
example, 10ms is required to do sophisticated bandwidth analysis using
uncore events.

The test shows that the overhead of the system-wide uncore monitoring
with 10ms interval is only ~2%. So this patch reduces the minimal
interval-print allowd to 10ms.

But 10ms may not work well for all cases. For example, when the
cpus/threads number is very large, for system-wide core event monitoring
the overhead could be high.

To handle this issue, a warning will be displayed when the
interval-print is set between 10ms to 100ms. So users can make a
decision according to their specific cases.

 # perf stat -e uncore_imc_1/cas_count_read/ -a --interval-print 10 -- sleep 1

 print interval < 100ms. The overhead percentage could be high in some
 cases. Please proceed with caution.
