ARM/dmaengine: edma: Move of_dma_controller_register to the dmaengine driver

If the of_dma_controller is registered in the non dmaengine driver we could
have race condition:
the of_dma_controller has been registered, but the dmaengine driver is not
yet probed. Drivers requesting DMA channels during this window will fail
since we do not yet have dmaengine drivers registered.
