serial: sh-sci: Do not resubmit DMA descriptors

Resubmission of DMA descriptors is explicitly forbidden by the DMA
engine API.

Hence pass DMA_CTRL_ACK to dmaengine_prep_slave_sg(), and prepare a new
DMA descriptor instead of reusing the old one.
Remove sci_port.desc_rx[], as there's no longer a need to access the
active descriptor.
