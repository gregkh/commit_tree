mm, page_alloc: remove unnecessary recalculations for dirty zone balancing

File-backed pages that will be immediately written are balanced between
zones.  This heuristic tries to avoid having a single zone filled with
recently dirtied pages but the checks are unnecessarily expensive.  Move
consider_zone_balanced into the alloc_context instead of checking bitmaps
multiple times.  The patch also gives the parameter a more meaningful
name.
