drm/i915: Hold dev->event_lock whilst inspecting intel_crtc->unpin_work

We should serialise access to the intel_crtc->unpin_work through the
dev->event_lock spinlock. It should not be possible for it to disappear
without severe error as the mmio_flip worker has not tagged the
unpin_work pending flip-completion. Similarly if the error exists, just
taking the unpin_work whilst holding the spinlock and then using it
unserialised just masks the race. (It is supposed to be valid as the
unpin_work exists until the flip completion interrupt which should not
fire until we flush the mmio writes to update the display base which is
the last time we access the unpin_work from the kthread.)
