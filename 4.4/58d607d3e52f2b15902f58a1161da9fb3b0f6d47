tcp: provide skb->hash to synack packets

In commit b73c3d0e4f0e ("net: Save TX flow hash in sock and set in skbuf
on xmit"), Tom provided a l4 hash to most outgoing TCP packets.

We'd like to provide one as well for SYNACK packets, so that all packets
of a given flow share same txhash, to later enable bonding driver to
also use skb->hash to perform slave selection.

Note that a SYNACK retransmit shuffles the tx hash, as Tom did
in commit 265f94ff54d62 ("net: Recompute sk_txhash on negative routing
advice") for established sockets.

This has nice effect making TCP flows resilient to some kind of black
holes, even at connection establish phase.
