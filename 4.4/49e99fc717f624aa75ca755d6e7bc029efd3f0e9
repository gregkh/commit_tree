dm thin metadata: fix bug when taking a metadata snapshot

When you take a metadata snapshot the btree roots for the mapping and
details tree need to have their reference counts incremented so they
persist for the lifetime of the metadata snap.

The roots being incremented were those currently written in the
superblock, which could possibly be out of date if concurrent IO is
triggering new mappings, breaking of sharing, etc.

Fix this by performing a commit with the metadata lock held while taking
a metadata snapshot.
