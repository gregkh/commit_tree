Revert "ipv6: ndisc: inherit metadata dst when creating ndisc requests"

This reverts commit ab450605b35caa768ca33e86db9403229bf42be4.

In IPv6, we cannot inherit the dst of the original dst. ndisc packets
are IPv6 packets and may take another route than the original packet.

This patch breaks the following scenario: a packet comes from eth0 and
is forwarded through vxlan1. The encapsulated packet triggers an NS
which cannot be sent because of the wrong route.
