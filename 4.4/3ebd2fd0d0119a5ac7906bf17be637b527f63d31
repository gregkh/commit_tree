IB/sa: Put netlink request into the request list before sending

It was found by Saurabh Sengar that the netlink code tried to allocate
memory with GFP_KERNEL while holding a spinlock. While it is possible
to fix the issue by replacing GFP_KERNEL with GFP_ATOMIC, it is better
to get rid of the spinlock while sending the packet. However, in order
to protect against a race condition that a quick response may be received
before the request is put on the request list, we need to put the request
on the list first.
