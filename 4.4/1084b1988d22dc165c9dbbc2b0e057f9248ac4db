xen: Add Xen specific page definition

The Xen hypercall interface is always using 4K page granularity on ARM
and x86 architecture.

With the incoming support of 64K page granularity for ARM64 guest, it
won't be possible to re-use the Linux page definition in Xen drivers.

Introduce Xen page definition helpers based on the Linux page
definition. They have exactly the same name but prefixed with
XEN_/xen_ prefix.

Also modify xen_page_to_gfn to use new Xen page definition.
