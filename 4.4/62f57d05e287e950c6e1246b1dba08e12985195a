crypto: pkcs7 - Fix unaligned access in pkcs7_verify()

On sparc, we see unaligned access messages on each modprobe[-r]:

Kernel unaligned access at TPC[6ad9b4] pkcs7_verify [..]
Kernel unaligned access at TPC[6a5484] crypto_shash_finup [..]
Kernel unaligned access at TPC[6a5390] crypto_shash_update [..]
Kernel unaligned access at TPC[10150308] sha1_sparc64_update [..]
Kernel unaligned access at TPC[101501ac] __sha1_sparc64_update [..]

These ware triggered by mod_verify_sig() invocations of pkcs_verify(), and
are are being caused by an unaligned desc at (sha1, digest_size is 0x14)
        desc = digest + digest_size;

To fix this, pkcs7_verify needs to make sure that desc is pointing
at an aligned value past the digest_size, and kzalloc appropriately,
taking alignment values into consideration.
