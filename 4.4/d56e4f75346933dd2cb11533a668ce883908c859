tpm: fix compat 'ppi' link handling in tpm_chip_register()

__compat_only_sysfs_link_entry_to_kobj() was unconditionally called for
TPM1 chips, which caused crash on Acer C720 laptop where DSM for the
ACPI object did not exist.

There are two reasons for unwanted behavior:

* The code did not check whether
  __compat_only_sysfs_link_entry_to_kobj() returned -ENOENT. This is
  OK. It just meanst that ppi is not available.
* The code did not clean up properly. Compat link should added only
  after all other init is done.

This patch sorts out these issues.
