block: ensure to split after potentially bouncing a bio

blk_queue_bio() does split then bounce, which makes the segment
counting based on pages before bouncing and could go wrong. Move
the split to after bouncing, like we do for blk-mq, and the we
fix the issue of having the bio count for segments be wrong.
