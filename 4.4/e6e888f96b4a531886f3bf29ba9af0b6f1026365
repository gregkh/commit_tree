x86/fpu: Check to ensure increasing-offset xstate offsets

The xstate CPUID leaves enumerate where each state component is
inside the XSAVE buffer, along with the size of the entire
buffer.  Our new XSAVE sanity-checking code extrapolates an
expected _total_ buffer size by looking at the last component
that it encounters.

That method requires that the highest-numbered component also
be the one with the highest offset.  This is a pretty safe
assumption, but let's add some code to ensure it stays true.

To make this check work correctly, we also need to ensure we
only consider the offsets from enabled features because the
offset register (ebx) will return 0 on unsupported features.

This also means that we will preserve the -1's that we
initialized xstate_offsets/sizes[] with.  That will help
find bugs.
