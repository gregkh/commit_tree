staging: fsl-mc: Added serialization to mc_send_command()

When the same portal is used to call mc_send_command() from two
different threads or a thread and an interrupt handler, serialization
is required, as the MC only supports one outstanding command per MC
portal. Thus, a new command should not be sent to the MC until the
last command sent has been responded by the MC.
