Revert "Staging: wilc1000: coreconfigurator: Drop unneeded wrapper functions"

The source and destination pointers are misplaced.
This will be like,
ether_addr_copy(data, bssid + ADDR2);
-> ether_addr_copy(bssid, data + ADDR2);
and also to use ether_addr_copy, it has to be proved that src/dst address are
properly aligned(2).

I revert this as author agree to drop this patch.

This reverts commit d4622f68db8095dd54179e3134e97812727f6b89.
