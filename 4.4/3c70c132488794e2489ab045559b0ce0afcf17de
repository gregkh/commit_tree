packet: only allow extra vlan len on ethernet devices

Packet sockets can be used by various net devices and are not
really restricted to ARPHRD_ETHER device types. However, when
currently checking for the extra 4 bytes that can be transmitted
in VLAN case, our assumption is that we generally probe on
ARPHRD_ETHER devices. Therefore, before looking into Ethernet
header, check the device type first.

This also fixes the issue where non-ARPHRD_ETHER devices could
have no dev->hard_header_len in TX_RING SOCK_RAW case, and thus
the check would test unfilled linear part of the skb (instead
of non-linear).

Fixes: 57f89bfa2140 ("network: Allow af_packet to transmit +4 bytes for VLAN packets.")
Fixes: 52f1454f629f ("packet: allow to transmit +4 byte in TX_RING slot for VLAN case")
