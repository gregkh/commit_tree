drm/i915: Add encoder->post_pll_disable() hooks and move CHV clock buffer disables there

Move the CHV clock buffer disable from chv_disable_pll() to the new
encoder .post_pll_disable() hook. This is more symmetric since the
clock buffer enable happens from the .pre_pll_enable() hook.

We'll have more use for the new hook soon.
