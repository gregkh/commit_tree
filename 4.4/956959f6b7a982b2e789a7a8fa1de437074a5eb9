perf trace: Fix documentation for -i

The -i flag was incorrectly listed as a short flag for --no-inherit.  It
should have only been listed as a short flag for --input.

This documentation error has existed since the --input flag was
introduced in 6810fc915f7a89d8134edb3996dbbf8eac386c26 (perf trace: Add
option to analyze events in a file versus live).
