x86/microcode: Initialize the driver late when facilities are up

Running microcode_init() from setup_arch() is a bad idea because
not even kmalloc() is ready at that point and the loader does
all kinds of allocations and init/registration with various
subsystems.

Make it a late initcall when required facilities are initialized
so that the microcode driver initialization can succeed too.
