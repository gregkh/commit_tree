tracing: Allow arch-specific stack tracer

A stack frame may be used in a different way depending on cpu architecture.
Thus it is not always appropriate to slurp the stack contents, as current
check_stack() does, in order to calcurate a stack index (height) at a given
function call. At least not on arm64.
In addition, there is a possibility that we will mistakenly detect a stale
stack frame which has not been overwritten.

This patch makes check_stack() a weak function so as to later implement
arch-specific version.
