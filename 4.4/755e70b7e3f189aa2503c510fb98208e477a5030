arm64: Clean config usages for page size

We use !CONFIG_ARM64_64K_PAGES for CONFIG_ARM64_4K_PAGES
(and vice versa) in code. It all worked well, so far since
we only had two options. Now, with the introduction of 16K,
these cases will break. This patch cleans up the code to
use the required CONFIG symbol expression without the assumption
that !64K => 4K (and vice versa)
