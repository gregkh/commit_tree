Documentation: devicetree: standardize/consolidate on "wakeup-source" property

Currently different drivers use multiple forms of annotating devices
that should be set up as wakeup sources for the system.

This patch adds a separate binding document inorder to standardize and
consolidate to use "wakeup-source" boolean property to mark the devices
as wakeup capable.
