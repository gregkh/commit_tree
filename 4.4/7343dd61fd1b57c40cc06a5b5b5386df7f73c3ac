btrfs: qgroup: exit the rescan worker during umount

I was hitting a consistent NULL pointer dereference during shutdown that
showed the trace running through end_workqueue_bio().  I traced it back to
the endio_meta_workers workqueue being poked after it had already been
destroyed.

Eventually I found that the root cause was a qgroup rescan that was still
in progress while we were stopping all the btrfs workers.

Currently we explicitly pause balance and scrub operations in
close_ctree(), but we do nothing to stop the qgroup rescan.  We should
probably be doing the same for qgroup rescan, but that's a much larger
change.  This small change is good enough to allow me to unmount without
crashing.
