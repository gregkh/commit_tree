of/irq: Use the msi-map property to provide device-specific MSI domain

While msi-parent is used to point to the MSI controller that
works for all the devices behind a root complex, it doesn't
allow configurations where each individual device can be routed
to a separate MSI controller.

The msi-map property provides this flexibility (and much more),
so let's add a utility function that parses it, and return the
corresponding MSI domain.
