clk: qcom: create virtual child device for TSENS

8960 family of devices have TSENS as part of GCC in hardware.
Hence DT would represent a GCC node with GCC properties as well
as TSENS. Create a virtual platform child device here for TSENS
so the driver can probe it and use the parent (GCC) to extract DT
properties.
