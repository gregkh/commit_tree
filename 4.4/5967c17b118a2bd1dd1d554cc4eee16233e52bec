KVM: s390: enable SIMD only when no VCPUs were created

We should never allow to enable/disable any facilities for the guest
when other VCPUs were already created.

kvm_arch_vcpu_(load|put) relies on SIMD not changing during runtime.
If somebody would create and run VCPUs and then decides to enable
SIMD, undefined behaviour could be possible (e.g. vector save area
not being set up).
