powerpc/eeh: Force reset on fenced PHB

On fenced PHB, the error handlers in the drivers of its subordinate
devices could return PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVER, indicating no reset
will be issued during the recovery. It's conflicting with the fact
that fenced PHB won't be recovered without reset.

This limits the return value from the error handlers in the drivers
of the fenced PHB's subordinate devices to PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_NONE
or PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET, to ensure reset will be issued during
recovery.
