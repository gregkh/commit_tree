New driver: rtl8xxxu (mac80211)

This is an alternate driver for a number of Realtek WiFi USB devices,
including RTL8723AU, RTL8188CU, RTL8188RU, RTL8191CU, and RTL8192CU.
It was written from scratch utilizing the Linux mac80211 stack.

After spending months cleaning up the vendor provided rtl8723au
driver, which comes with it's own 802.11 stack included, I decided to
rewrite this driver from the bottom up.

Many thanks to Johannes Berg for 802.11 insights and help and Larry
Finger for help with the vendor driver.

The full git log for the development of this driver can be found here:
git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jes/linux.git
    branch rtl8723au-mac80211

This driver is still under development, but has proven to be very
stable for me. It currently supports station mode only. It has support
for OFDM and CCK rates. It does lack certain features found in the
staging driver, such as power management, AMPDU, and 40MHz channel
support. In addition it does not support AD-HOC, AP, and monitor mode
support at this point.

The driver is known to work with the following devices:
Lenovo Yoga (rtl8723au)
TP-Link TL-WN823N (rtl8192cu)
Etekcity 6R (rtl8188cu)
Daffodil LAN03 (rtl8188cu)
Alfa AWUS036NHR (rtl8188ru)
