serial: sh-sci: Add DT support to DMA setup

Add support for obtaining DMA channel information from the device tree.

This requires switching from the legacy sh_dmae_slave structures with
hardcoded channel numbers and the corresponding filter function to:
  1. dma_request_slave_channel_compat(),
       - On legacy platforms, dma_request_slave_channel_compat() uses
	 the passed DMA channel numbers that originate from platform
	 device data,
       - On DT-based platforms, dma_request_slave_channel_compat() will
	 retrieve the information from DT.
  2. and the generic dmaengine_slave_config() configuration method,
     which requires filling in DMA register ports and slave bus widths.
