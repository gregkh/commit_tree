powerpc/opal-irqchip: Fix double endian conversion

The OPAL event calls return a mask of events that are active in big
endian format. This is checked when unmasking the events in the
irqchip by comparison with a cached value. The cached value was stored
in big endian format but should've been converted to CPU endian
first.

This bug leads to OPAL event delivery being delayed or dropped on some
systems. Symptoms may include a non-functional console.

The bug is fixed by calling opal_handle_events(...) instead of
duplicating code in opal_event_unmask(...).
