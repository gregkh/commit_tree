drm/i915: Only update the current userptr worker

The userptr worker allows for a slight race condition where upon there
may two or more threads calling get_user_pages for the same object. When
we have the array of pages, then we serialise the update of the object.
However, the worker should only overwrite the obj->userptr.work pointer
if and only if it is the active one. Currently we clear it for a
secondary worker with the effect that we may rarely force a second
lookup.

v2: Rebase and rename a variable to avoid 80cols
v3: Mention v2
