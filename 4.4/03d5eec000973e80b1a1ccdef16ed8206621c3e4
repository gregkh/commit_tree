cpufreq: conservative: remove 'enable' field

Conservative governor has its own 'enable' field to check if
conservative governor is used for a CPU or not

This can be checked by policy->governor with 'cpufreq_gov_conservative'
and so this field can be dropped.

Because its not guaranteed that dbs_info->cdbs.shared will a valid
pointer for all CPUs (will be NULL for CPUs that don't use
ondemand/conservative governors), we can't use it anymore. Lets get
policy with cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() instead.
