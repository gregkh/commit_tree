usb: dwc2: host: create a function to handle port_resume

port resume sequence may be used in different places. Create a
function to handle it. Make hprt0 read-modify-write atomic and
clear HPRT0_SUSP for both writes as it is a "read, write-set,
and self-clear (R_WS_SC)" bit. Since the lock is released
between the writes, read hprt0 again.

Since the phy clock is stopped in dwc2_port_suspend(), enable it
here and remove the PCGCTL write from dwc2_hcd_hub_control()
