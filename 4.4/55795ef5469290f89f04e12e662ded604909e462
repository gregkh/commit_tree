net: filter: make JITs zero A for SKF_AD_ALU_XOR_X

The SKF_AD_ALU_XOR_X ancillary is not like the other ancillary data
instructions since it XORs A with X while all the others replace A with
some loaded value.  All the BPF JITs fail to clear A if this is used as
the first instruction in a filter.  This was found using american fuzzy
lop.

Add a helper to determine if A needs to be cleared given the first
instruction in a filter, and use this in the JITs.  Except for ARM, the
rest have only been compile-tested.
