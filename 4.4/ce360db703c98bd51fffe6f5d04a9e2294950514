ACPI / processor: Fix thermal cooling device regression

The processor cooling device is no longer present for passive thermal
control.

Commit 239708a3af44 ("ACPI: Split out ACPI PSS from ACPI Processor driver")
moved the processing to a new function acpi_pss_perf_init(), but
missed "return 0" after successful creation.  This causes the error
handling functions to be called, which will delete the previously
created processor cooling device.
