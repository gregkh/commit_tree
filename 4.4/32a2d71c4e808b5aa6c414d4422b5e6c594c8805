vfio: platform: introduce vfio-platform-base module

To prepare for vfio platform reset rework let's build
vfio_platform_common.c and vfio_platform_irq.c in a separate
module from vfio-platform and vfio-amba. This makes possible
to have separate module inits and works around a race between
platform driver init and vfio reset module init: that way we
make sure symbols exported by base are available when vfio-platform
driver gets probed.

The open/release being implemented in the base module, the ref
count is applied to the parent module instead.
