dmaengine: hsu: make the UART driver in control of selecting this driver

HSU (High Speed UART) DMA engine, like the name suggests, is
an integrated DMA engine for UART and UART alone. Therefore,
making the UART drivers responsible of selecting it and
removing the user selectable option for it. The UARTs with
this DMA engine can always select HSU_DMA when
SERIAL_8250_DMA option is enabled.
