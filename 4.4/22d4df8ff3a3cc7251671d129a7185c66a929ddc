ravb: Add support for r8a7795 SoC

This patch supports the r8a7795 SoC by:
- Using two interrupts
  + One for E-MAC
  + One for everything else
  + Both can be handled by the existing common interrupt handler, which
    affords a simpler update to support the new SoC. In future some
    consideration may be given to implementing multiple interrupt handlers
- Limiting the phy speed to 100Mbit/s for the new SoC;
  at this time it is not clear how this restriction may be lifted
  but I hope it will be possible as more information comes to light
