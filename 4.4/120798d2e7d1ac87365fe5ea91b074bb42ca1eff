arm64: mm: remove dsb from update_mmu_cache

update_mmu_cache() consists of a dsb(ishst) instruction so that new user
mappings are guaranteed to be visible to the page table walker on
exception return.

In reality this can be a very expensive operation which is rarely needed.
Removing this barrier shows a modest improvement in hackbench scores and
, in the worst case, we re-take the user fault and establish that there
was nothing to do.
