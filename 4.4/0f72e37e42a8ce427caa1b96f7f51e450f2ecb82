tracing: Add sched_wakeup_new and sched_waking tracepoints for pid filter

The set_event_pid filter relies on attaching to the sched_switch and
sched_wakeup tracepoints to see if it should filter the tracing on schedule
tracepoints. By adding the callbacks to sched_wakeup, pids in the
set_event_pid file will trace the wakeups of those tasks with those pids.

But sched_wakeup_new and sched_waking were missed. These two should also be
traced. Luckily, these tracepoints share the same class as sched_wakeup
which means they can use the same pre and post callbacks as sched_wakeup
does.
