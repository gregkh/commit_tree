mISDN: fix a loop count

There are two issue here.
1)  cnt starts as maxloop + 1 so all these loops iterate one more time
    than intended.
2)  At the end of the loop we test for "if (maxloop && !cnt)" but for
    the first two loops, we end with cnt equal to -1.  Changing this to
    a pre-op means we end with cnt set to 0.
