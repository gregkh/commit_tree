ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable common regulators for rockchip boards

Rockchip boards seem to have two common regulator setups. Various board
used the Active Semi act8846 often in combination with Silergy syr82x
regulators (e.g. Radxa Rock Pro/Rock 2, Firefly, and Netxeon R89 etc),
while others use regulator part of the Rockchip RK808 chip (e.g. the
various Veyron based chromebooks, Chipspark Popmetal etc)

Enable all these regulators.
