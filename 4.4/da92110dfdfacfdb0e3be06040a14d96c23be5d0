EDAC, amd64_edac: Extend scrub rate support to F15hM60h

The scrub rate control register has moved to function 2 in PCI config
space and is at a different offset on family 0x15, models 0x60 and
later. The minimum recommended scrub rate has also changed. (Refer to
D18F2x1c9_dct[1:0][DramScrub] in Fam15hM60h BKDG).

Adjust set_scrub_rate() and get_scrub_rate() functions to accommodate
this.

Tested on F15hM60h, Fam15h, models 00h-0fh and Fam10h systems.
