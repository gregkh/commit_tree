ARCv2: mm: THP support

MMUv4 in HS38x cores supports Super Pages which are basis for Linux THP
support.

Normal and Super pages can co-exist (ofcourse not overlap) in TLB with a
new bit "SZ" in TLB page desciptor to distinguish between them.
Super Page size is configurable in hardware (4K to 16M), but fixed once
RTL builds.

The exact THP size a Linx configuration will support is a function of:
 - MMU page size (typical 8K, RTL fixed)
 - software page walker address split between PGD:PTE:PFN (typical
   11:8:13, but can be changed with 1 line)

So for above default, THP size supported is 8K * 256 = 2M

Default Page Walker is 2 levels, PGD:PTE:PFN, which in THP regime
reduces to 1 level (as PTE is folded into PGD and canonically referred
to as PMD).

Thus thp PMD accessors are implemented in terms of PTE (just like sparc)
