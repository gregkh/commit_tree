ALSA: Constify ratden/ratnum constraints

The ALSA core does not modify the constraints provided by a driver. Most
constraint helper functions already take a const pointer to the constraint
description, the exception at the moment being the ratden and ratnum
constraints. Make those const as well, this allows a driver to declare them
as const.
