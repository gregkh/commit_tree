mlxsw: cmd: Introduce per-FID flooding tables

In the newly introduced Spectrum switch ASIC, packets destined to not
offloaded netdevs will be classified to special FIDs (vFIDs) in the
device and flooded to the CPU port.

The flooding table used is of type per-FID, which allows one to create
different flooding domains for different vFIDs.

While using a simple single-entry flood table is certainly sufficient at
this point, we do plan to offload 802.1D bridges involving VLAN
interfaces, thus making this change necessary.

Add support for this flooding table type, by exposing the configuration
of the number of tables from this type and their size.
