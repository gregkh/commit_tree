ASoC: rockchip: spdif: Set transmit data level to 16 samples

Explicitly set the transmit data level on the transceiver to 16 samples
rather then the default 0. This matches both the level set in the vendor
kernel and the (seemingly very similar) i2s engine. This fixes audio
glitches when playing back at 192k rate.

At the same time, fix a trivial typo in the TDL mask definition
