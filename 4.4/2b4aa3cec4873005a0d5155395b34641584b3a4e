net: Remove dev_queue_xmit_sk

A function with weird arguments that it will never use to accomdate a
netfilter callback prototype is absolutely in the core of the
networking stack.  Frankly it does not make sense and it causes a lot
of confusion as to why arguments that are never used are being passed
to the function.

As I am preparing to make a second change to arguments to the okfn even
the names stops making sense.

As I have removed the two callers of this function remove this confusion
from the networking stack.
