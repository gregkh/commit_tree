staging: wilc1000: remove wilc_errorsupport.h

This patch removes the wilc_errorsupport.h which is not used anymore and
also deletes #include "wilc_errorsupport.h" from the source code.

In addition, adds linux_wlan_common.h file in the wilc_msgqueue.c file
in order to use PRINT macros defined in the linux_wlan_common.h file.
