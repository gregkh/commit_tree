sctp: translate host order to network order when setting a hmacid

now sctp auth cannot work well when setting a hmacid manually, which
is caused by that we didn't use the network order for hmacid, so fix
it by adding the transformation in sctp_auth_ep_set_hmacs.

even we set hmacid with the network order in userspace, it still
can't work, because of this condition in sctp_auth_ep_set_hmacs():

		if (id > SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_MAX)
			return -EOPNOTSUPP;

so this wasn't working before and thus it won't break compatibility.
