Revert "drm/i915: Call encoder hotplug for init and resume cases"

This reverts commit 5d250b05918c002b63632c7db91c3c5f924c6a3b.

It results on a deadlock on platforms where we need to (at least
partially) re-init hpd interrupts from power domain code, since
->hot_plug might again grab a power well reference (to do edid/dp_aux
transactions. At least chv is affected.
