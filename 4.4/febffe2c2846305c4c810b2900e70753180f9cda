staging/rdma/hfi1: Fix port bounce issues with 0.22 DC firmware

The DC firmware overwrites the enable_lane_tx register and does not update it
on a host request to go to Poll. This causes an infinite loop through the LNI
state machine if a link width downgrade occurs. This patch re-sets the
enable_lane_tx register to all 4 lanes.
