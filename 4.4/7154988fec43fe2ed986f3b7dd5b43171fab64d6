drivers/tty: make pty.c slightly more explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/tty/Kconfig:config LEGACY_PTYS
drivers/tty/Kconfig:    bool "Legacy (BSD) PTY support"

...and:

drivers/tty/Kconfig:config UNIX98_PTYS
drivers/tty/Kconfig:    bool "Unix98 PTY support" if EXPERT

combined with this:

obj-$(CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS)       += pty.o
obj-$(CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS)       += pty.o

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the traces of modularity we can so that when reading the
driver there is less doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We don't delete the module.h include since other parts of the file are
using content from there.
