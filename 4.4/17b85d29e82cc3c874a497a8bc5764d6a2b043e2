net/core: revert "net: fix __netdev_update_features return.." and add comment

This reverts commit 00ee59271777 ("net: fix __netdev_update_features return
on ndo_set_features failure")
and adds a comment explaining why it's okay to return a value other than
0 upon error. Some drivers might actually change flags and return an
error so it's better to fire a spurious notification rather than miss
these.
