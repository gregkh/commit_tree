drm/i915/bxt: Fix wrongly placed ')' in I915_READ()

Not the first time! not the last time?

There is a possibility to use gcc 5's -Wbool-compare to try and compare
(reg) in those macros to a constant and gcc will warn that the
comparison between a boolean expression and a constant is always either
true or false. Maybe.
