net: ip6mr: fix static mfc/dev leaks on table destruction

Similar to ipv4, when destroying an mrt table the static mfc entries and
the static devices are kept, which leads to devices that can never be
destroyed (because of refcnt taken) and leaked memory. Make sure that
everything is cleaned up on netns destruction.
