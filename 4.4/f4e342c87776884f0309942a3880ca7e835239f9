x86/mm: Skip the hypervisor range when walking PGD

The range between 0xffff800000000000 and 0xffff87ffffffffff is reserved
for hypervisor and therefore we should not try to follow PGD's indexes
corresponding to those addresses.

While this has always been a problem, with the new W+X warning
mechanism ptdump_walk_pgd_level_core() can now be called during boot,
causing a PV Xen guest to crash.

[ tglx: Replaced the macro with a readable inline ]
