tools lib traceevent: Support %ps/%pS

Commits such as 65dd297ac25565 ("xfs: %pF is only for function
pointers") caused a regression because pretty_print() didn't support
%ps/%pS.  The current %pf/%pF implementation in pretty_print() is what
%ps/%pS is supposed to do, so use the same code for %ps/%pS.

Addressing the incorrect %pf/%pF implementation is beyond the scope of
this patch.
