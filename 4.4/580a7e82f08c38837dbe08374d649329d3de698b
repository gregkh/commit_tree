HID: logitech-hidpp: split HIDPP_QUIRK_DELAYED_INIT in two

HIDPP_QUIRK_DELAYED_INIT means two things currently:
- we want to delay the initialization process
- we do not want hid to create an input device based on the report
  descriptor.

This should actually be 2 different quirks so we can have special connect
events while still having HID creating the input for us.
