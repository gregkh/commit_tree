drm/i915: Force CL2 off in CHV x1 PHY

We can choose to leave the display PHY CL2 powerdown up to some hardware
signals, or we can force it. The BXT code forces the nonexistent CL2 in
the x1 PHY to power down. Follow suit on CHV. Maybe it can still save
some extra power by disabling some extra logic in CL1, or something.
