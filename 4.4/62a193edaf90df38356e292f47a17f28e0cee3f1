KVM: x86: request interrupt window when IRQ chip is split

Before this patch, we incorrectly enter the guest without requesting an
interrupt window if the IRQ chip is split between user space and the
kernel.

Because lapic_in_kernel no longer implies the PIC is in the kernel, this
patch tests pic_in_kernel to determining whether an interrupt window
should be requested when entering the guest.

If the APIC is in the kernel and we request an interrupt window the
guest will return immediately. If the APIC is masked the guest will not
not make forward progress and unmask it, leading to a loop when KVM
reenters and requests again. This patch adds a check to ensure the APIC
is ready to accept an interrupt before requesting a window.
