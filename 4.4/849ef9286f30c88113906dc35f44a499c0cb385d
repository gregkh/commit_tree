btrfs: check unsupported filters in balance arguments

We don't verify that all the balance filter arguments supplemented by
the flags are actually known to the kernel. Thus we let it silently pass
and do nothing.

At the moment this means only the 'limit' filter, but we're going to add
a few more soon so it's better to have that fixed. Also in older stable
kernels so that it works with newer userspace tools.
