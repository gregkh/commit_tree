mmc: sdhci: call sdhci_init() before request irq

sdhci_init() will clear all irqs and set the needed irqs. So
logically sdhci_init() should be called before request irq.

If not, some irqs may be triggled and handled wrongly. Take
the following into consideration, after request irq, if
SDIO card interrupt enabled, a sd card in the sd slot will
trigger a mass of interrupt(SDHCI_INT_CARD_INT), because at
this time, the vmmc-regulator still not restore, no voltage
supply for the sd card, so the pin of data0~data3 change and
keep low, interrupt(SDHCI_INT_CARD_INT) will rise up ceaselessly.
Due to we already reguest irq, system will be busy in handling
this endless irq, can't response to other event.

So we should call sdhci_init() before request irq in sd resume.
