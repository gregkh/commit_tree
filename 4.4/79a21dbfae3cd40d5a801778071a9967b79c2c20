powercap / RAPL: fix BIOS lock check

Intel RAPL initialized on several systems where the BIOS lock bit (msr
0x610, bit 63) was set.  This occured because the return value of
rapl_read_data_raw() was being checked, rather than the value of the variable
passed in, locked.

This patch properly implments the rapl_read_data_raw() call to check the
variable locked, and now the Intel RAPL driver outputs the warning:

	intel_rapl: RAPL package 0 domain package locked by BIOS

and does not initialize for the package.
