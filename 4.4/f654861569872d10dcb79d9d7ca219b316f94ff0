skbuff: Fix offset error in skb_reorder_vlan_header

skb_reorder_vlan_header is called after the vlan header has
been pulled.  As a result the offset of the begining of
the mac header has been incrased by 4 bytes (VLAN_HLEN).
When moving the mac addresses, include this incrase in
the offset calcualation so that the mac addresses are
copied correctly.
