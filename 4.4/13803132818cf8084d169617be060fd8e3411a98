drm/core: Preserve the framebuffer after removing it.

Previously RMFB and fd close chose to disable any plane that had
an active framebuffer from this file. If it was a primary plane the
crtc was disabled. However the fbdev code or any system compositor
should restore the planes anyway so there's no need to do it twice.

The old fb_id is zero'd, so there's no danger of being able to
restore the fb from fb_id.
