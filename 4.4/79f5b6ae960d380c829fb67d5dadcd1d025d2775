[media] c8sectpfe: Remove select on CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK

c8sectpfe driver selects CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK by some
reason, but this option is known to be harmful, leading to minutes of
stalls at boot time.  The option was intended for only compatibility
for an old exotic system that mandates the udev interaction, and not a
thing a driver selects by itself.  Let's remove it.

Fixes: 850a3f7d5911 ('[media] c8sectpfe: Add Kconfig and Makefile for the driver')
