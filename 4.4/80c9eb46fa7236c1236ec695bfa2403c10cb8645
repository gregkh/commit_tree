lib/vsprintf.c: remove SPECIAL handling in pointer()

As a quick

   git grep -E '%[ +0#-]*#[ +0#-]*(\*|[0-9]+)?(\.(\*|[0-9]+)?)?p'

shows, nobody uses the # flag with %p. Should one try to do so, one
will be met with

  warning: `#' flag used with `%p' gnu_printf format [-Wformat]

(POSIX and C99 both say "... For other conversion specifiers, the
behavior is undefined.". Obviously, the kernel can choose to define
the behaviour however it wants, but as long as gcc issues that
warning, users are unlikely to show up.)

Since default_width is effectively always 2*sizeof(void*), we can
simplify the prologue of pointer() and save a few instructions.
