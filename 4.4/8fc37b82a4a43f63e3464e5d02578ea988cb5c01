usb: dwc2: gadget: handle reset interrupt before endpoint interrupts

If system is loaded, reset, enum-done and setup interrupts can occur
at the same time. Current interrupt handling sequence will handle
setup packet's interrupt before handling reset interrupt. Which will
break the enumeration process. Correct sequence is to handle reset,
enum-done and then any other endpoint interrupts.
