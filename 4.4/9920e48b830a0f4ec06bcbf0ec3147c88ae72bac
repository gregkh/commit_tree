ipv4: use l4 hash for locally generated multipath flows

This patch changes how the multipath hash is computed for locally
generated flows: now the hash comprises l4 information.

This allows better utilization of the available paths when the existing
flows have the same source IP and the same destination IP: with l3 hash,
even when multiple connections are in place simultaneously, a single path
will be used, while with l4 hash we can use all the available paths.

v2 changes:
- use get_hash_from_flowi4() instead of implementing just another l4 hash
