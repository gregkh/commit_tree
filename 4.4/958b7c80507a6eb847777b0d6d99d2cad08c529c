powerpc/xmon: Paged output for paca display

The paca display is already more than 24 lines, which can be problematic
if you have an old school 80x24 terminal, or more likely you are on a
virtual terminal which does not scroll for whatever reason.

This patch adds a new command "#", which takes a single (hex) numeric
argument: lines per page. It will cause the output of "dp" and "dpa"
to be broken into pages, if necessary.

Sample output:

0:mon> # 10
0:mon> dp1
