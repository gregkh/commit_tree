NFC: st-nci: Add support for proprietary commands

Add support for proprietary commands useful mainly for
factory testings. Here is a list:

- FACTORY_MODE: Allow to set the driver into a mode where
  no secure element are activated. It does not consider any
  NFC_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA.
- HCI_CLEAR_ALL_PIPES: Allow to execute a HCI clear all pipes
  command. It does not consider any NFC_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA.
- HCI_DM_PUT_DATA: Allow to configure specific CLF registry
  like for example RF trimmings or low level drivers
  configurations (I2C, SPI, SWP).
- HCI_DM_UPDATE_AID: Allow to configure an AID routing into the
  CLF routing table following RF technology, CLF mode or protocol.
- HCI_DM_GET_INFO: Allow to retrieve CLF information.
- HCI_DM_GET_DATA: Allow to retrieve CLF configurable data such as
  low level drivers configurations or RF trimmings.
- HCI_DM_DIRECT_LOAD: Allow to load a firmware into the CLF.
  A complete packet can be more than 8KB.
- HCI_DM_RESET: Allow to run a CLF reset in order to "commit" CLF
  configuration changes without CLF power off.
- HCI_GET_PARAM: Allow to retrieve an HCI CLF parameter (for example
  the white list).
- HCI_DM_FIELD_GENERATOR: Allow to generate different kind of RF
  technology. When using this command to anti-collision is done.
- HCI_LOOPBACK: Allow to echo a command and test the Dh to CLF
  connectivity.
- HCI_DM_VDC_MEASUREMENT_VALUE: Allow to measure the field applied
  on the CLF antenna. A value between 0 and 0x0f is returned. 0 is
  maximum.
- HCI_DM_FWUPD_START: Allow to put CLF into firmware update mode.
  It is a specific CLF command as there is no GPIO for this.
- HCI_DM_FWUPD_END:  Allow to complete firmware update.
- HCI_DM_VDC_VALUE_COMPARISON: Allow to compare the field applied
  on the CLF antenna to a reference value.
- MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC: Allow to retrieve manufacturer specific data
  received during a NCI_CORE_INIT_CMD.
