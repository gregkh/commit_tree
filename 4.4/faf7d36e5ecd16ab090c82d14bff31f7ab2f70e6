ieee802154: 6lowpan: add generic lowpan header check

This patch introduce an earlier check if a 6LoWPAN frame can be valid.
This contains at first for checking if the header contains a dispatch
byte and isn't the nalp dispatch value, which means it isn't a 6LoWPAN
packet. Also we add a check if we can derference the dispatch value by
checking if skb->len is unequal zero.
