ata: ahci: find eSATA ports and flag them as removable

If the AHCI ports' HPCP or ESP bits are set, the port
should be considered external (e.g. eSATA) and is marked
as removable.  Userspace tools like udisks then treat it
like an usb drive.

With this patch applied, when I plug a drive into the esata port,
KDE pops up a window asking what to do with the drives(s), just
like it does for any random USB stick.

Removability is indicated to the upper layers by way of the
SCSI RMB bit, as I haven't found another way to signal
userspace to treat a sata disk like any usb stick.
