bnxt_en: Setup uc_list mac filters after resetting the chip.

Call bnxt_cfg_rx_mode() in bnxt_init_chip() to setup uc_list and
mc_list mac address filters.  Before the patch, uc_list is not
setup again after chip reset (such as ethtool ring size change)
and macvlans don't work any more after that.

Modify bnxt_cfg_rx_mode() to return error codes appropriately so
that the init chip sequence can detect any failures.
