btrfs: fix signed overflows in btrfs_sync_file

The calculation of range length in btrfs_sync_file leads to signed
overflow. This was caught by PaX gcc SIZE_OVERFLOW plugin.

The fsync call passes 0 and LLONG_MAX, the range length does not fit to
loff_t and overflows, but the value is converted to u64 so it silently
works as expected.

The minimal fix is a typecast to u64, switching functions to take
(start, end) instead of (start, len) would be more intrusive.

Coccinelle script found that there's one more opencoded calculation of
the length.
