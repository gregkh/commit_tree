mm/oom_kill: remove the wrong fatal_signal_pending() check in oom_kill_process()

The fatal_signal_pending() was added to suppress unnecessary "sharing same
memory" message, but it can't 100% help anyway because it can be
false-negative; SIGKILL can be already dequeued.

And worse, it can be false-positive due to exec or coredump.  exec is
mostly fine, but coredump is not.  It is possible that the group leader
has the pending SIGKILL because its sub-thread originated the coredump, in
this case we must not skip this process.

We could probably add the additional ->group_exit_task check but this
patch just removes the wrong check along with pr_info().
