DT: mmc: sh_mmcif: fix "compatible" property text

The "compatible" property text contradicts even the example given in the MMCIF
binding document itself;  moreover, the Renesas MMCIF driver only matches  on
the generic "compatible" string and doesn't look for the SoC specific strings
at all. Thus describe "renesas,sh-mmcif" as a fallback value.
