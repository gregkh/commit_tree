drm/atomic-helper: Add option to update planes only on active crtc

With drivers supporting runtime pm it's generally not a good idea to
touch the hardware when it's off. Add an option to the commit_planes
helper to support this case.

Note that the helpers already add all planes on a crtc when a modeset
happens, hence plane updates will not be lost if drivers set this to
true.

v2: Check for NULL state->crtc before chasing the pointer. Also check
both old and new crtc if there's a switch. Finally just outright
disallow switching crtcs for a plane if the plane is in active use, on
most hardware that doesn't make sense.

v3: Since commit_planes(active_only = true) is for enabling things
only after all the crtc are on we should only look at the new crtc to
decide whether to call the plane hooks - if the current CRTC isn't on
then skip. If the old crtc (when moving a plane) went down then the
plane should have been disabled as part of the pipe shutdown work
already. For which there's currently no helper really unfortunately.
Also move the check for wether a plane gets a new CRTC assigned while
still in active use out of this patch.

v4: Rebase over exynos changes.
