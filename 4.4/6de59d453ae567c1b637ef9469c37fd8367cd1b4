crypto: marvell/cesa - use __le32 for hardware descriptors

Much of the driver uses cpu_to_le32() to convert values for descriptors
to little endian before writing.  Use __le32 to define the hardware-
accessed parts of the descriptors, and ensure most places where it's
reasonable to do so use cpu_to_le32() when assigning to these.
