perf inject: Remove more aux-related stuff when processing instruction traces

perf inject can process instruction traces (using the --itrace option)
which removes aux-related events and replaces them with the requested
synthesized events.

However there are still some leftovers, namely PERF_RECORD_ITRACE_START
events and the original evsel (selected event) e.g. intel_pt//

For the sake of completeness, remove them too.
