KVM: x86: fix interrupt window handling in split IRQ chip case

This patch ensures that dm_request_for_irq_injection and
post_kvm_run_save are in sync, avoiding that an endless ping-pong
between userspace (who correctly notices that IF=0) and
the kernel (who insists that userspace handles its request
for the interrupt window).

To synchronize them, it also adds checks for kvm_arch_interrupt_allowed
and !kvm_event_needs_reinjection.  These are always needed, not
just for in-kernel LAPIC.
