drivers/misc: make kgdbts.c slightly more explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

lib/Kconfig.kgdb:config KGDB_TESTS
lib/Kconfig.kgdb:       bool "KGDB: internal test suite"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We can't remove the module.h include since we've kept the use of
module_param in this file for now.
