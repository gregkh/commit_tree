6pack: fix free memory scribbles

commit acf673a3187edf72068ee2f92f4dc47d66baed47 fixed a user triggerable free
memory scribble but in doing so replaced it with a different one that allows
the user to control the data and scribble even more.

sixpack_close is called by the tty layer in tty context. The tty context is
protected by sp_get() and sp_put(). However network layer activity via
sp_xmit() is not protected this way. We must therefore stop the queue
otherwise the user gets to dump a buffer mostly of their choice into freed
kernel pages.
