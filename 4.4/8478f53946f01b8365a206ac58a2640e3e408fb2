cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix limits->max_policy_pct rounding error

I have a Intel (6,63) processor with a "marketing" frequency (from
/proc/cpuinfo) of 2100MHz, and a max turbo frequency of 2600MHz.  I
can execute

cpupower frequency-set -g powersave --min 1200MHz --max 2100MHz

and the max_freq_pct is set to 80.  When adding load to the system I noticed
that the cpu frequency only reached 2000MHZ and not 2100MHz as expected.

This is because limits->max_policy_pct is calculated as 2100 * 100 /2600 = 80.7
and is rounded down to 80 when it should be rounded up to 81.  This patch
adds a DIV_ROUND_UP() which will return the correct value.
