i40e: Fix for Tools loopback test failing after driver load

This patch fixes a problem where our Tools MAC Loopback test, after
driver unbind would fail.  This was because the hw was configured
for multiqueue and unbind operation did not clear this configuration.
The problem is fixed by resetting this configuration in i40e_remove.
