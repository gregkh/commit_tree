mmc: core: Keep host claimed while invoking mmc_power_off|up()

As mmc_claim_host() invokes pm_runtime_get_sync() for the mmc host device,
it's important that the host is kept claimed for *all* accesses to it via
the host_ops callbacks.

In some code paths for SDIO, particularly related to the PM support,
mmc_power_off|up() is invoked without keeping the host claimed. Let's fix
these.

Moreover, mmc_start|stop_host() also invokes mmc_power_off|up() without
claiming the host, let's fix these as well.
