net: mvpp2: fix missing DMA region unmap in egress processing

The Tx descriptor release code currently calls dma_unmap_single() and
dev_kfree_skb_any() if the descriptor is associated with a non-NULL skb.
This condition is true only for the last fragment of the packet.

Since every descriptor's buffer is DMA-mapped it has to be properly
unmapped.
