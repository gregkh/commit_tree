fm10k: don't store sw_vid at reset

If we store the sw_vid at reset of PF, then we accidentally prevent the
VF from receiving the message to update its default VID. This only
occurs if the VF is created before the PF has come up, which is the
standard way of creating VFs when using the module parameter.

This fixes an issue where we request the incorrect MAC/VLAN
combinations, and prevents us from accidentally reporting some frames as
VLAN tagged.
