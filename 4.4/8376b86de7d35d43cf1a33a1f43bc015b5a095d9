iw_cxgb4: Support the new memory registration API

Support the new memory registration API by allocating a
private page list array in c4iw_mr and populate it when
c4iw_map_mr_sg is invoked. Also, support IB_WR_REG_MR
by duplicating build_fastreg just take the needed information
from different places:
- page_size, iova, length (ib_mr)
- page array (c4iw_mr)
- key, access flags (ib_reg_wr)

The IB_WR_FAST_REG_MR handlers will be removed later when
all the ULPs will be converted.
