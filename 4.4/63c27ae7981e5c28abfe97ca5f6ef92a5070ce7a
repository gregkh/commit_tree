ARM: 8434/2: Revert "7655/1: smp_twd: make twd_local_timer_of_register() no-op for nosmp"

This reverts commit 904464b91eca8c665acea033489225af02eeb75a.

The problem pointed out by commit 904464b91eca ("ARM: 7655/1:
smp_twd: make twd_local_timer_of_register() no-op for nosmp")
doesn't exist anymore.

We can safely boot with nosmp and the warning won't show up.

The other side benefit of this patch is that TWD has a chance
to probe on single-core A9 systems such as AM437x which sport
TWD.

While at that, also drop SMP dependency from TWD's Kconfig entry.
