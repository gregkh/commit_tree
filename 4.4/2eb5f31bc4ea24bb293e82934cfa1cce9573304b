um: Switch clocksource to hrtimers

UML is using an obsolete itimer call for
all timers and "polls" for kernel space timer firing
in its userspace portion resulting in a long list
of bugs and incorrect behaviour(s). It also uses
ITIMER_VIRTUAL for its timer which results in the
timer being dependent on it running and the cpu
load.

This patch fixes this by moving to posix high resolution
timers firing off CLOCK_MONOTONIC and relaying the timer
correctly to the UML userspace.

Fixes:
 - crashes when hosts suspends/resumes
 - broken userspace timers - effecive ~40Hz instead
   of what they should be. Note - this modifies skas behavior
   by no longer setting an itimer per clone(). Timer events
   are relayed instead.
 - kernel network packet scheduling disciplines
 - tcp behaviour especially under load
 - various timer related corner cases

Finally, overall responsiveness of userspace is better.
