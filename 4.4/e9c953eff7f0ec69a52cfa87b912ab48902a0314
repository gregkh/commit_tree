bridge: vlan: use rcu for vlan_list traversal in br_fill_ifinfo

br_fill_ifinfo is called by br_ifinfo_notify which can be called from
many contexts with different locks held, sometimes it relies upon
bridge's spinlock only which is a problem for the vlan code, so use
explicitly rcu for that to avoid problems.
