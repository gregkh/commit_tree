mm/vmscan.c: fix types of some locals

In zone_reclaimable_pages(), `nr' is returned by a function which is
declared as returning "unsigned long", so declare it such.  Negative
values are meaningless here.

In zone_pagecache_reclaimable() we should also declare `delta' and
`nr_pagecache_reclaimable' as being unsigned longs because they're used to
store the values returned by zone_page_state() and
zone_unmapped_file_pages() which also happen to return unsigned integers.
