debugfs: Consolidate file mode checks in debugfs_create_*()

The code that creates debugfs file with different file ops based
on the file mode is duplicated in each debugfs_create_*() API.
Consolidate that code into debugfs_create_mode(), that takes
three file ops structures so that we don't have to keep
copy/pasting that logic.
