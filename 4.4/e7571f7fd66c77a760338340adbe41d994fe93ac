drm/i915: Break busywaiting for requests on pending signals

The busywait in __i915_spin_request() does not respect pending signals
and so may consume the entire timeslice for the task instead of
returning to userspace to handle the signal.

In the worst case this could cause a delay in signal processing of 20ms,
which would be a noticeable jitter in cursor tracking. If a higher
resolution signal was being used, for example to provide fairness of a
server timeslices between clients, we could expect to detect some
unfairness between clients (i.e. some windows not updating as fast as
others). This issue was noticed when inspecting a report of poor
interactivity resulting from excessively high __i915_spin_request usage.

Fixes regression from
