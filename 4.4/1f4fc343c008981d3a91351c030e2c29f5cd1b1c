staging/lustre: use 64-bit times for cfs_srand seed

Several functions in Lustre call cfs_srand with do_gettimeofday
as the seed to get a pseudo-random number.
There is no bug here, but changing it to use ktime_get_ts64()
gets us closer to deprecating do_gettimeofday() and makes it slightly
more random.

Affected functions are:
lnet_shuffle_seed, init_lustre_lite and class_handle_init
