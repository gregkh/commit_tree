cgroup: factor out css_set_move_task()

A task is associated and disassociated with its css_set in three
places - during migration, after a new task is created and when a task
exits.  The first is handled by cgroup_task_migrate() and the latter
two are open-coded.

These are similar operations and spreading them over multiple places
makes it harder to follow and update.  This patch collects all task
css_set [dis]association operations into css_set_move_task().

While css_set_move_task() may check whether populated state needs to
be updated when not strictly necessary, the behavior is essentially
equivalent before and after this patch.
