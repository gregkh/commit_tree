i40e: Fix basic support for X722 devices

Acquire NVM, before issuing an AQ read nvm command for X722.
We need to acquire the NVM before issuing an AQ read to the NVM
otherwise we will get EBUSY from the FW. Also release when done.

This fixes the two X722 issues with respect to eeprom checksum verify
and reading NVM version info.

With this patch in place, i40e driver will provide basic support
for X722 devices.
