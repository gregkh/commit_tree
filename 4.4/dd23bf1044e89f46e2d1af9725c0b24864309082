Input: db9 - store object at correct index

The variable i is used to check the port to attach to and we are
supposed to save the reference of struct db9 in the location given by
db9_base[i]. But after finding out the index, i is getting modified again
so we saved in a wrong index.
While at it mark db9_base[i] as NULL after it is freed.
