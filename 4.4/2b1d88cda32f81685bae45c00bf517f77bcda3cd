PM / Domains: Merge measurements for PM QoS device latencies

Measure latency does by itself contribute to an increased latency, thus we
should avoid it when it isn't needed.

By merging the latency measurements for the ->save_state() and the
->stop() callbacks, we get one measurement instead of two and we get one
value to store instead of two. Let's also apply the likewise change for
the ->start() and ->restore_state() callbacks.
