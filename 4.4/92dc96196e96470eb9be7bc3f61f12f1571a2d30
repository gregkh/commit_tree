ACPICA: Update exception code for "file not found" error

ACPICA commit ac1564c26d239348ef13455f61d5616f3961ff43

Used by the ACPICA applications.

This patch is a bit broken due to non-portable <errno.h> inclusion as on
some platforms, there is no such a header file for their lib-c exports.
Fortunately, Linux doesn't compile utfileio.c for either the kernel
space ACPICA core (drivers/acpi/acpica) or the userspace ACPICA tools
(tools/power/acpi) for now, so it's safe to leave this patch as it is.
