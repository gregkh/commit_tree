s390/fpu: always enable the vector facility if it is available

If the kernel detects that the s390 hardware supports the vector
facility, it is enabled by default at an early stage.  To force
it off, use the novx kernel parameter.  Note that there is a small
time window, where the vector facility is enabled before it is
forced to be off.

With enabling the vector facility by default, the FPU save and
restore functions can be improved.  They do not longer require
to manage expensive control register updates to enable or disable
the vector enablement control for particular processes.
