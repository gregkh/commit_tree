lightnvm: keep track of block counts

Maintain number of in use blocks, free blocks, and bad blocks in a per
lun basis. This allows the upper layers to get information about the
state of each lun.

Also, account for blocks reserved to the device on the free block count.
nr_free_blocks matches now the actual number of blocks on the free list
when the device is booted.
