Staging: lustre: obd: put constant on the right of binary operator

Move constants to the right of binary operators.

A simplified version of the semantic patch that makes this change is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
constant c;
expression e;
binary operator b = {==,!=,&,|};
@@

(
- c
+ e
b
- e
+ c
|
- c < e
+ e > c
)
// </smpl>
