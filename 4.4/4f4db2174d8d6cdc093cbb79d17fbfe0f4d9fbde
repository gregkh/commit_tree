Btrfs: keep track of max_extent_size per space_info

When we are heavily fragmented we can induce a lot of latency trying to make an
allocation happen that is simply not going to happen.  Thankfully we keep track
of our max_extent_size when going through the allocator, so if we get to the
point where we are exiting find_free_extent with ENOSPC then set our
space_info->max_extent_size so we can keep future allocations from having to pay
this cost.  We reset the max_extent_size whenever we release pinned bytes back
into this space info so we can redo all the work.  Thanks,
