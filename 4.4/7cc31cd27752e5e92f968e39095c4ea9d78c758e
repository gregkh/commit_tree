misc: mic: SCIF DMA and CPU copy interface

SCIF allows users to read from or write to registered remote memory
via CPU copies or DMA. The API verifies that both local and remote
windows are valid before initiating the CPU or DMA transfers. SCIF has
optimized algorithms for handling byte aligned as well as cache line
aligned DMA engines. A registration cache is maintained to avoid the
overhead of pinning pages repeatedly if buffers are reused. The
registration cache is invalidated upon receipt of MMU notifier
callbacks.  SCIF windows are destroyed and the pages are unpinned only
once all prior DMAs initiated using that window are drained. Users can
request synchronous DMA operations as well as tail byte ordering if
required. CPU copies are always performed synchronously.
