hwmon: (sht15) Select CONFIG_BITREVERSE

If CONFIG_BITREVERSE is not built-in, the sht15 driver fails to link:

drivers/built-in.o: In function `sht15_crc8':
drivers/hwmon/sht15.c:195: undefined reference to `byte_rev_table'

This adds a Kconfig 'select' statement, like all other users of
bitrev.h have it.
