ALSA: firewire-lib: add a restriction for a transaction at once

Currently, when waiting for a response, callers can start another
transaction by scheduling another work. This is not good for error
processing of transaction, especially the first response is too late.

This commit serialize request/response transactions, by adding one
boolean member to represent idling state.
