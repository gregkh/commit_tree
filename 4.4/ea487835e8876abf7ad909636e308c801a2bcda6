drm: Enforce unlocked ioctl operation for kms driver ioctls

With the prep patches for i915 all kms drivers either have
DRM_UNLOCKED on all their ioctls. Or the ioctl always directly returns
with an invariant return value when in modeset mode. But that's only
the case for i915 and radeon. The drm core ioctls are unfortunately
too much a mess still to dare this.

Follow-up patches will remove DRM_UNLOCKED from all kms drivers to
prove that this is indeed the case.

Also update the documentation.

v2: Really only do this for driver ioctls, spotted by David Herrmann.
And drop spurious whitespace change.
