staging: wilc1000: remove COMPLEMENT_BOOT

This patch removes a preprocessor definition, COMPLEMENT_BOOT which is not used
anymore. This is just workaround to avoid weird issue, which is that 11b core
is not ready after the power is givin to the chip. However, this issue happened
only in the unstable hardware a long time ago and no more seen. In addition,
this patch removes _fail_threads_ statement to avoid the build warning after
removing COMPLEMENT_BOOT conditionals.
