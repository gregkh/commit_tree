mfd: Kconfig: Compile MFD_STW481X with COMPILE_TEST

The driver depends on ARCH_NOMADIK but there isn't a build dependency
so it's a good idea to allow the driver to always be built when the
COMPILE_TEST option is enabled.

That way, the driver can be built with a config generated by make
allyesconfig and check if a patch would break the build.
