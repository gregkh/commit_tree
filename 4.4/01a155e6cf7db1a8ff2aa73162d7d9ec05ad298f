xfs: DAX does not use IO completion callbacks

For DAX, we are now doing block zeroing during allocation. This
means we no longer need a special DAX fault IO completion callback
to do unwritten extent conversion. Because mmap never extends the
file size (it SEGVs the process) we don't need a callback to update
the file size, either. Hence we can remove the completion callbacks
from the __dax_fault and __dax_mkwrite calls.
