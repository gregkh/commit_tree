perf report: Fix a bug on "--call-graph none" option

The patch f9db0d0f1b2c ("perf callchain: Allow disabling call graphs
per event") added an ability to enable/disable callchain recording per
event.  But it had a problem when the enablement setting is changed at
'perf report' time using -g/--call-graph option.

For example, the following scenario will get a segfault.

  $ perf record -ag sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.500 MB perf.data (2555 samples) ]

  $ perf report -g none
  perf: Segmentation fault
  -------- backtrace --------
  perf[0x53a98a]
  /usr/lib/libc.so.6(+0x335af)[0x7f4e91df95af]

This is because callchain_param.sort() callback was not set but it
tried to call the function as it had the PERF_SAMPLE_CALLCHAIN bit.
