btrfs: add balance filters limits, stripes and usage to supported mask

Enable the extended 'limit' syntax (a range), the new 'stripes' and
extended 'usage' syntax (a range) filters in the filters mask. The patch
comes separate and not within the series that introduced the new filters
because the patch adding the mask was merged in a late rc. The
integration branch was based on an older rc and could not merge the
patch due to the missing changes.

Prerequisities:
* btrfs: check unsupported filters in balance arguments
* btrfs: extend balance filter limit to take minimum and maximum
* btrfs: add balance filter for stripes
* btrfs: extend balance filter usage to take minimum and maximum
