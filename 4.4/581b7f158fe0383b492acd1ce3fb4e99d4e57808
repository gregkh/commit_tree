x86/cpu: Fix SMAP check in PVOPS environments

There appears to be no formal statement of what pv_irq_ops.save_fl() is
supposed to return precisely.  Native returns the full flags, while lguest and
Xen only return the Interrupt Flag, and both have comments by the
implementations stating that only the Interrupt Flag is looked at.  This may
have been true when initially implemented, but no longer is.

To make matters worse, the Xen PVOP leaves the upper bits undefined, making
the BUG_ON() undefined behaviour.  Experimentally, this now trips for 32bit PV
guests on Broadwell hardware.  The BUG_ON() is consistent for an individual
build, but not consistent for all builds.  It has also been a sitting timebomb
since SMAP support was introduced.

Use native_save_fl() instead, which will obtain an accurate view of the AC
flag.
