firmware: add support for ARM System Control and Power Interface(SCPI) protocol

This patch adds support for System Control and Power Interface (SCPI)
Message Protocol used between the Application Cores(AP) and the System
Control Processor(SCP). The MHU peripheral provides a mechanism for
inter-processor communication between SCP's M3 processor and AP.

SCP offers control and management of the core/cluster power states,
various power domain DVFS including the core/cluster, certain system
clocks configuration, thermal sensors and many others.

This protocol driver provides interface for all the client drivers using
SCPI to make use of the features offered by the SCP.
