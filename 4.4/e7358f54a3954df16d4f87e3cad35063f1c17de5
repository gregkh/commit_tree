i40e/i40evf: Add a workaround to drop all flow control frames

This patch adds a workaround to drop any flow control frames from being
transmitted from any VSI. FW can still send flow control frames if flow
control is enabled.

With this patch in place a malicious VF cannot send flow control or PFC
packets out on the wire.
