ipvs: Remove possibly unused variable from ip_vs_out

Eric's net namespace changes in 1b75097dd7a26 leaves net unreferenced if
CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6 is not enabled:

../net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_core.c: In function ‘ip_vs_out’:
../net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_core.c:1177:14: warning: unused variable ‘net’ [-Wunused-variable]

After the net refactoring there is only 1 user; push the reference to the
1 user. While the line length slightly exceeds 80 it seems to be the
best change.

Fixes: 1b75097dd7a26("ipvs: Pass ipvs into ip_vs_out")
