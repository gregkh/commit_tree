mm: pack compound_dtor and compound_order into one word in struct page

The patch halves space occupied by compound_dtor and compound_order in
struct page.

For compound_order, it's trivial long -> short conversion.

For get_compound_page_dtor(), we now use hardcoded table for destructor
lookup and store its index in the struct page instead of direct pointer
to destructor. It shouldn't be a big trouble to maintain the table: we
have only two destructor and NULL currently.

This patch free up one word in tail pages for reuse. This is preparation
for the next patch.
