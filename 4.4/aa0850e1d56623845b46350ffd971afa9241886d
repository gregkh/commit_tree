[media] airspy: increase USB control message buffer size

Driver requested device firmware version string during probe using
only 24 byte long buffer. That buffer is too small for newer firmware
versions, which causes device firmware hang - device stops responding
to any commands after that. Increase buffer size to 128 which should
be enough for any current and future version strings.
