android, lmk: Send SIGKILL before setting TIF_MEMDIE.

It was observed that setting TIF_MEMDIE before sending SIGKILL at
oom_kill_process() allows memory reserves to be depleted by allocations
which are not needed for terminating the OOM victim.

This patch reverts commit 6bc2b856bb7c ("staging: android: lowmemorykiller:
set TIF_MEMDIE before send kill sig"), for oom_kill_process() was updated
to send SIGKILL before setting TIF_MEMDIE.
