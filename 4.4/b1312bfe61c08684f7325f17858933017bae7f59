get_maintainer: add --no-foo options to --help

Many flag options are boolean and support both a positive and a negative
invocation from the command line.  Some of these are even mentioned by
example (e.g., --nogit is mentioned as a default option), but they aren't
explicitly mentioned in the list of options.  It happens that some of
these are pretty important, as they are default-on, and to turn them off,
you have to know about the --no-foo version.

Rather than clutter the whole help text with bracketed '--[no]foo', let's
just mention the general rule, a la 'man gcc'.
