cachefiles: perform test on s_blocksize when opening cache file.

cachefiles requires that s_blocksize in the cache is not greater than
PAGE_SIZE, and performs the check every time a block is accessed.

Move the test to the place where the file is "opened", where other
file-validity tests are performed.
