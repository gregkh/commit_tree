mmc: core: Remove MMC_CLKGATE

MMC_CLKGATE was once invented to save power by gating the bus clock at
request inactivity. At that time it served its purpose. The modern way to
deal with power saving for these scenarios, is by using runtime PM.

Nowadays, several host drivers have deployed runtime PM, but for those
that haven't and which still cares power saving at request inactivity,
it's certainly time to deploy runtime PM as it has been around for several
years now.

To simplify code to mmc core and thus decrease maintenance efforts, this
patch removes all code related to MMC_CLKGATE.
