virtio/s390: handle error values in irb

The common I/O layer may pass an error value as the irb in the device's
interrupt handler (for classic channel I/O). This won't happen in
current virtio-ccw implementations, but it's better to be safe than
sorry.

Let's just return the error conveyed by the irb and clear any possible
pending I/O indications.
