NFC: st-nci: Add ese-present/uicc-present dts properties

In order to align with st21nfca, dts configuration properties
ese_present and uicc_present are made available in st-nci driver.

So far, in early development firmware, because
nci_nfcee_mode_set(DISABLE) was not supported we had to try to
enable it during the secure element discovery phase.

After several trials on commercial and qualified firmware it appears
that nci_nfcee_mode_set(ENABLE) and nci_nfcee_mode_set(DISABLE) are
properly supported.

Such feature also help us to eventually save some time (~5ms) when
only one secure element is connected.
