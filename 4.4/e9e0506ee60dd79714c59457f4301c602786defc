vfio: platform: use list of registered reset function

Remove the static lookup table and use the dynamic list of registered
reset functions instead. Also load the reset module through its alias.
The reset struct module pointer is stored in vfio_platform_device.

We also remove the useless struct device pointer parameter in
vfio_platform_get_reset.

This patch fixes the issue related to the usage of __symbol_get, which
besides from being moot, prevented compilation with CONFIG_MODULES
disabled.

Also usage of MODULE_ALIAS makes possible to add a new reset module
without needing to update the framework. This was suggested by Arnd.
