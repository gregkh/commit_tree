ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix to fill all sink/source pipe params

Currently params only for first copier widget identified in the
source/sink path is queried from NHLT. In the dapm route the
playback/capture widget may be connected to more than one copier
widget. This patch adds return check to return only for any error
case.
