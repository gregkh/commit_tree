documentation: Catch up list of torture_type options

This commit rids the documentation of long-obsolete torture_type options
such as rcu_sync and adds new ones such as tasks.  Also add verbiage
noting the fact that rcutorture now concurrently tests the asynchrounous,
synchronous, expedited synchronous, and polling grace-period primitives.
