staging: wilc1000: use id value as argument

The driver communicates with the chipset via the address of handlers
to distinguish async data frame. The SendConfigPkt function gets the
pointer address indicating the handlers as the last argument, but this
requires redundant typecasting and does not support the 64 bit machine.

This patch adds the function which assigns ID values instead of pointer
representing the driver handler to the address and then uses the ID
instead of pointer as the last argument of SendConfigPkt. The driver
also gets the handler's address from the ID in the data frame when it
receives them.
