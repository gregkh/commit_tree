drm/i915: Eliminate usage of plane_wm_parameters from ILK-style WM code (v2)

Just pull the info out of the plane state structure rather than staging
it in an additional structure.

v2: Add 'visible' condition to sprites_scaled so that we don't limit the
    WM level when the sprite isn't enabled.  (Ville)
