Bluetooth: Unwind l2cap_sock_shutdown()

l2cap_sock_shutdown() is designed to only action shutdown
of the channel when shutdown is not already in progress.
Therefore, reorganise the code flow by adding a goto
to jump to the end of function handling when shutdown is
already being actioned. This removes one level of code
indentation and make the code more readable.
