timers: Use __fls in apply_slack()

In apply_slack(), find_last_bit() is applied to a bitmask consisting
of precisely BITS_PER_LONG bits. Since mask is non-zero, we might as
well eliminate the function call and use __fls() directly. On x86_64,
this shaves 23 bytes of the only caller, mod_timer().

This also gets rid of Coverity CID 1192106, but that is a false
positive: Coverity is not aware that mask != 0 implies that
find_last_bit will not return BITS_PER_LONG.
