cls_bpf: make binding to classid optional

The binding to a particular classid was so far always mandatory for
cls_bpf, but it doesn't need to be. Therefore, lift this restriction
as similarly done in other classifiers.

Only a couple of qdiscs make use of class from the tcf_result, others
don't strictly care, so let the user choose his needs (those that read
out class can handle situations where it could be NULL).

An explicit check for tcf_unbind_filter() is also not needed here, as
the previous r->class was 0, so the xchg() will return that and
therefore a callback to the qdisc's unbind_tcf() is skipped.
