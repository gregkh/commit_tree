bpf: align and clean bpf_{map,prog}_get helpers

Add a bpf_map_get() function that we're going to use later on and
align/clean the remaining helpers a bit so that we have them a bit
more consistent:

  - __bpf_map_get() and __bpf_prog_get() that both work on the fd
    struct, check whether the descriptor is eBPF and return the
    pointer to the map/prog stored in the private data.

    Also, we can return f.file->private_data directly, the function
    signature is enough of a documentation already.

  - bpf_map_get() and bpf_prog_get() that both work on u32 user fd,
    call their respective __bpf_map_get()/__bpf_prog_get() variants,
    and take a reference.
