perf tests: Move x86 tests into arch directory

Move out the x86-specific tests into tools/perf/arch/x86/tests and
define an 'arch_tests' array, which is the list of tests that only apply
to the build architecture.

We can also now begin to get rid of some of the #ifdef code that is
present in the generic perf tests.
