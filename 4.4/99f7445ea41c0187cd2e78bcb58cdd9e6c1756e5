ARM: shmobile: porter: enable internal PCI and USB PHY

Enable  internal AHB-PCI bridges for the USB EHCI/OHCI controllers attached
to them and also enable  USB PHY device  for the Porter board.  We have to
enable  everything in one patch since EHCI/OHCI devices are already linked
to the USB PHY device.
