rcu: Make ->cpu_no_qs be a union for aggregate OR

This commit converts the rcu_data structure's ->cpu_no_qs field
to a union.  The bytewise side of this union allows individual access
to indications as to whether this CPU needs to find a quiescent state
for a normal (.norm) and/or expedited (.exp) grace period.  The setwise
side of the union allows testing whether or not a quiescent state is
needed at all, for either type of grace period.

For now, only .norm is used.  A later commit will introduce the expedited
usage.
