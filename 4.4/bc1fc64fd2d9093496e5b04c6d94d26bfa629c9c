ixgbe: Fix FCRTH value in VM-to-VM loopback mode

The 82599 and X540 datasheets require that FCRTH be "set" for Tx
switching (VM-to-VM loopback) but it did not previously specify what
the value should be set to. It has now been determined that
the correct value is RXPBSIZE - (24*1024).

This setting is also required for later devices.
