qed: fix handling of concurrent ramrods.

Concurrent non-blocking slowpath ramrods can be completed
out-of-order on the completion chain. Recycling completed elements,
while previously sent elements are still completion pending,
can lead to overriding of active elements on the chain. Furthermore,
sending pending slowpath ramrods currently lacks the update of the
chain element physical pointer.

This patch:
* Ensures that ramrods are sent to the FW with
  consecutive echo values.
* Handles out-of-order completions by freeing only first
  successive completed entries.
* Updates the chain element physical pointer when copying
  a pending element into a free element for sending.
