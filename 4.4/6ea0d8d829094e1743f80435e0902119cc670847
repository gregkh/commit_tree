ARM: dts: sun6i: hummingbird: Use axp22x.dtsi for AXP221 regulators

Now that we have axp22x.dtsi describing common axp22x hardware, use
it and reference the nodes instead of declaring the whole tree.

Also drop the "always-on" from the vdd-gpu regulator, since we don't
support the GPU anyway.

And add a regulator reference for cpu0.
