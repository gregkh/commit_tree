serial: atmel: fix compiler warning on address cast

Turning on KVM and LPAE support on top of a multi_v7_defconfig will
produce a compiler warning in the Atmel serial driver:
drivers/tty/serial/atmel_serial.c: In function 'atmel_verify_port':
drivers/tty/serial/atmel_serial.c:2299:6: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
  if ((void *)port->mapbase != ser->iomem_base)
      ^

Fix that by using the cast on the right hand side instead, as similar
code already does in other drivers.
