PM / Domains: Allocate memory outside domain locks

In preparation for supporting IRQ-safe domains, allocate domain data
outside the domain locks. These functions are not called in an atomic
context, so we can always allocate memory using GFP_KERNEL. By
allocating memory before the locks, we can safely lock the domain using
spinlocks instead of mutexes.
