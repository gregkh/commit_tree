misc: mic: Remove COSM functionality from the MIC card driver

Since card side COSM functionality, to trigger MIC device shutdowns
and communicate shutdown status to the host, is now moved into a
separate COSM client driver, this patch removes this functionality
from the base MIC card driver. The mic_bus driver is also updated to
use the device index provided by COSM rather than maintain its own
device index.
