bridge: vlan: move back vlan_flush

Ido Schimmel reported a problem with switchdev devices because of the
order change of del_nbp operations, more specifically the move of
nbp_vlan_flush() which deletes all vlans and frees vlgrp after the
rx_handler has been unregistered. So in order to fix this move
vlan_flush back where it was and make it destroy the rhtable after
NULLing vlgrp and waiting a grace period to make sure noone can see it.
