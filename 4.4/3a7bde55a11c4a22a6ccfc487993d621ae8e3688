switchdev: fix: erasing too much of vlan obj when handling multiple vlan specs

When adding vlans with multiple IFLA_BRIDGE_VLAN_INFO attrs set in AFSPEC,
we would wipe the vlan obj struct after the first IFLA_BRIDGE_VLAN_INFO.
Fix this by only clearing what's necessary on each IFLA_BRIDGE_VLAN_INFO
iteration.
