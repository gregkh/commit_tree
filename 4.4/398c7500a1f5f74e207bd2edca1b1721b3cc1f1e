MIPS: VDSO: Fix build error with binutils 2.24 and earlier

Commit 2a037f310bab ("MIPS: VDSO: Fix build error") tries to fix a build
error seen with binutils 2.24 and earlier. However, the fix does not work,
and again results in the already known build errors if the kernel is built
with an earlier version of binutils.
