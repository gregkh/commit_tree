net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: isolate unbridged ports

The DSA documentation specifies that each port must be capable of
forwarding frames to the CPU port. The last changes on bridging support
for the mv88e6xxx driver broke this requirement for non-bridged ports.

So as for the bridged ports, reserve a few VLANs (4000+) in the switch
to isolate ports that have not been bridged yet.

By default, a port will be isolated with the CPU and DSA ports. When the
port joins a bridge, it will leave its reserved port. When it is removed
from a bridge, it will join its reserved VLAN again.
