ethernet devices.

v5:

  - Broke up 2 long message strings with "\n" (suggested by John Linville)
  - Constify an array of strings (suggested by Stephen Hemminger)
  - Improve bnxt_vf_pciid() (suggested by Stephen Hemminger)
  - Use PCI_VDEVICE() to populate pci_device_id table for more compact
    source.

v3:
  - Fixed 2 more sparse warnings.
  - Removed some unused structures in .h files.

v2:
  - Fixed all kbuild test robot reported warnings.
  - Fixed many of the checkpatch.pl errors and warnings.
