IB/core: Introduce new fast registration API

The new fast registration  verb ib_map_mr_sg receives a scatterlist
and converts it to a page list under the verbs API thus hiding
the specific HW mapping details away from the consumer.

The provider drivers are provided with a generic helper ib_sg_to_pages
that converts a scatterlist into a vector of page addresses. The
drivers can still perform any HW specific page address setting
by passing a set_page function pointer which will be invoked for
each page address. This allows drivers to avoid keeping a shadow
page vectors and convert them to HW specific translations by doing
extra copies.

This API will allow ULPs to remove the duplicated code of constructing
a page vector from a given sg list.

The send work request ib_reg_wr also shrinks as it will contain only
mr, key and access flags in addition.
