atomic, arch: Audit atomic_{read,set}()

This patch makes sure that atomic_{read,set}() are at least
{READ,WRITE}_ONCE().

We already had the 'requirement' that atomic_read() should use
ACCESS_ONCE(), and most archs had this, but a few were lacking.
All are now converted to use READ_ONCE().

And, by a symmetry and general paranoia argument, upgrade atomic_set()
to use WRITE_ONCE().
