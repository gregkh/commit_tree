arm64: efi: deal with NULL return value of early_memremap()

Add NULL return value checks to two invocations of early_memremap()
in the UEFI init code. For the UEFI configuration tables, we just
warn since we have a better chance of being able to report the issue
in a way that can actually be noticed by a human operator if we don't
abort right away. For the UEFI memory map, however, all we can do is
panic() since we cannot proceed without a description of memory.
