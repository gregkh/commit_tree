Smack: limited capability for changing process label

This feature introduces new kernel interface:

- <smack_fs>/relabel-self - for setting transition labels list

This list is used to control smack label transition mechanism.
List is set by, and per process. Process can transit to new label only if
label is on the list. Only process with CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability can add
labels to this list. With this list, process can change it's label without
CAP_MAC_ADMIN but only once. After label changing, list is unset.

Changes in v2:
* use list_for_each_entry instead of _rcu during label write
* added missing description in security/Smack.txt

Changes in v3:
* squashed into one commit

Changes in v4:
* switch from global list to per-task list
* since the per-task list is accessed only by the task itself
  there is no need to use synchronization mechanisms on it

Changes in v5:
* change smackfs interface of relabel-self to the one used for onlycap
  multiple labels are accepted, separated by space, which
  replace the previous list upon write
