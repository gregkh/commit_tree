s390/zcrypt: use explicit return code for flushed requests

If a AP device is removed while messages are still pending, the requests
are cancelled by calling the message receive function with an error pointer
for the reply. The message type receive handler recognize this and create
a fake hardware error TYPE82_RSP_CODE / REP82_ERROR_MACHINE_FAILURE.
The message with the hardware error then causes a printk and a return
code of -EAGAIN.

Replace the intricate scheme with an explicit return code for this sitation
and avoid the error message.
