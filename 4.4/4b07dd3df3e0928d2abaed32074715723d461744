drivers/tty: make hvc_console.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/tty/hvc/Kconfig:config HVC_DRIVER
drivers/tty/hvc/Kconfig:        bool

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only, even
though someone bothered to comment that the code was not used.

Unlike other changes, this driver binds in w/o using module_init,
so we dont have init ordering concerns with this commit.
