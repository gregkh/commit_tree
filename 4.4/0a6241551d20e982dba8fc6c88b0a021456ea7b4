net: stmmac: avoid using timespec

We want to deprecate the use of 'struct timespec' on 32-bit
architectures, as it is will overflow in 2038. The stmmac
driver uses it to read the current time, and can simply
be changed to use ktime_get_real_ts64() instead.

Because of hardware limitations, there is still an overflow
in year 2106, which we cannot really avoid, but this documents
the overflow.
