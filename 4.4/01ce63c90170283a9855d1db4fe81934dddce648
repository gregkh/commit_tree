sctp: update the netstamp_needed counter when copying sockets

Dmitry Vyukov reported that SCTP was triggering a WARN on socket destroy
related to disabling sock timestamp.

When SCTP accepts an association or peel one off, it copies sock flags
but forgot to call net_enable_timestamp() if a packet timestamping flag
was copied, leading to extra calls to net_disable_timestamp() whenever
such clones were closed.

The fix is to call net_enable_timestamp() whenever we copy a sock with
that flag on, like tcp does.
