Input: document and check on implicitly defined FF_MAX_EFFECTS

There is an undocumented upper bound for the total number of ff effects:
    FF_GAIN (= 96).
This can be found as follows:
- user: write(EV_FF, effect_id, iterations)
    calls kernel: ff->playback(effect_id, ...): starts effect "effect_id"
- user: write(EV_FF, FF_GAIN, gain)
    calls kernel: ff->set_gain(gain, ...): sets gain

A collision occurs when effect_id equals FF_GAIN.
According to input_ff_event(),
FF_GAIN is the smallest value where a collision occurs.
Therefore the greatest safe value for effect_id is FF_GAIN - 1,
and thus the total number of effects should never exceed FF_GAIN.

Define FF_MAX_EFFECTS as FF_GAIN and check on this limit in ff-core.
