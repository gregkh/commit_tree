dma-mapping: tidy up dma_parms default handling

Many DMA controllers and other devices set max_segment_size to
indicate their scatter-gather capability, but have no interest in
segment_boundary_mask. However, the existence of a dma_parms structure
precludes the use of any default value, leaving them as zeros (assuming
a properly kzalloc'ed structure). If a well-behaved IOMMU (or SWIOTLB)
then tries to respect this by ensuring a mapped segment does not cross
a zero-byte boundary, hilarity ensues.

Since zero is a nonsensical value for either parameter, treat it as an
indicator for "default", as might be expected. In the process, clean up
a bit by replacing the bare constants with slightly more meaningful
macros and removing the superfluous "else" statements.
