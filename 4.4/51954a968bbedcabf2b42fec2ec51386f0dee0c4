crypto: marvell/cesa - fix the bit length endianness

The endianness of the bit length used in the final stage depends on the
endianness of the algorithm - md5 hashes need it to be in little endian
format, whereas SHA hashes need it in big endian format.  Use the
previously added algorithm endianness flag to control this.
