dmaengine: edma: Simplify and optimize the edma_execute path

The code path in edma_execute() and edma_callback() can be simplified
and make it more optimal.
There is not need to call in to edma_execute() when the transfer
has been finished for example.
Also the handling of missed/first or next batch of paRAMs can
be done in a more optimal way.
