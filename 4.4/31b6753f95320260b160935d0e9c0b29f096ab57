perf tests: Add arch tests

Tests that only make sense for some architectures currently live in
the same place as the generic tests. Move out the x86-specific tests
into tools/perf/arch/x86/tests and define an 'arch_tests' array, which
is the list of tests that only apply to the build architecture.

The main idea is to encourage developers to add arch tests to build
out perf's test coverage, without dumping everything in
tools/perf/tests.
