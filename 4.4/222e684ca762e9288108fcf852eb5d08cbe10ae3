vfio/pci: make an array larger

Smatch complains about a possible out of bounds error:

	drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci_config.c:1241 vfio_cap_init()
	error: buffer overflow 'pci_cap_length' 20 <= 20

The problem is that pci_cap_length[] was defined as large enough to
hold "PCI_CAP_ID_AF + 1" elements.  The code in vfio_cap_init() assumes
it has PCI_CAP_ID_MAX + 1 elements.  Originally, PCI_CAP_ID_AF and
PCI_CAP_ID_MAX were the same but then we introduced PCI_CAP_ID_EA in
commit f80b0ba95964 ("PCI: Add Enhanced Allocation register entries")
so now the array is too small.

Let's fix this by making the array size PCI_CAP_ID_MAX + 1.  And let's
make a similar change to pci_ext_cap_length[] for consistency.  Also
both these arrays can be made const.
