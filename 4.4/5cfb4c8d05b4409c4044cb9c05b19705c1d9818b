packet: fix tpacket_snd max frame len

Since it's introduction in commit 69e3c75f4d54 ("net: TX_RING and
packet mmap"), TX_RING could be used from SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW
side. When used with SOCK_DGRAM only, the size_max > dev->mtu +
reserve check should have reserve as 0, but currently, this is
unconditionally set (in it's original form as dev->hard_header_len).

I think this is not correct since tpacket_fill_skb() would then
take dev->mtu and dev->hard_header_len into account for SOCK_DGRAM,
the extra VLAN_HLEN could be possible in both cases. Presumably, the
reserve code was copied from packet_snd(), but later on missed the
check. Make it similar as we have it in packet_snd().
