arm64: use ENDPIPROC() to annotate position independent assembler routines

For more control over which functions are called with the MMU off or
with the UEFI 1:1 mapping active, annotate some assembler routines as
position independent. This is done by introducing ENDPIPROC(), which
replaces the ENDPROC() declaration of those routines.
