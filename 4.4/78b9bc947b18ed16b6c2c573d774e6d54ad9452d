efi: Fix warning of int-to-pointer-cast on x86 32-bit builds

Commit:

  0f96a99dab36 ("efi: Add "efi_fake_mem" boot option")

introduced the following warning message:

  drivers/firmware/efi/fake_mem.c:186:20: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]

new_memmap_phy was defined as a u64 value and cast to void*,
causing a int-to-pointer-cast warning on x86 32-bit builds.
However, since the void* type is inappropriate for a physical
address, the definition of struct efi_memory_map::phys_map has
been changed to phys_addr_t in the previous patch, and so the
cast can be dropped entirely.

This patch also changes the type of the "new_memmap_phy"
variable from "u64" to "phys_addr_t" to align with the types of
memblock_alloc() and struct efi_memory_map::phys_map.
