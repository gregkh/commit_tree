arm64: Juno: Add support for the PCIe host bridge on Juno R1

Juno R1 board sports a functional PCIe host bridge that is
compliant with the SBSA standard found [1] here. With the right
firmware that initialises the XpressRICH3 controller one can
use the generic Host Bridge driver to use the PCIe hardware.
