pwm: Add Broadcom BCM7038 PWM controller support

Add support for the BCM7038-style PWM controller found in all BCM7xxx STB SoCs.
This controller has a hardcoded 2 channels per controller, and cascades a
variable frequency generator on top of a fixed frequency generator which offers
a range of a 148ns period all the way to ~622ms periods.
