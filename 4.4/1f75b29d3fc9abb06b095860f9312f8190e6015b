drm/radeon: Handle DP_AUX_I2C_WRITE_STATUS_UPDATE

When we get an i2c defer or short ack for i2c-over-aux write we need
to switch to WRITE_STATUS_UPDATE to poll for the completion of the
original request.

Looks like radeon doesn't do anything special with the request type,
so hopefully just treating it the same as a i2c write is enough.
