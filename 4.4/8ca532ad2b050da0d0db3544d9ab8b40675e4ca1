tracing: Check all tasks on each CPU when filtering pids

My tests found that if a task is running but not filtered when set_event_pid
is modified, then it can still be traced.

Call on_each_cpu() to check if the current running task should be filtered
and update the per cpu flags of tr->data appropriately.
