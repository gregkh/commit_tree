ipv6: Pass struct net into nf_ct_frag6_gather

The function nf_ct_frag6_gather is called on both the input and the
output paths of the networking stack.  In particular ipv6_defrag which
calls nf_ct_frag6_gather is called from both the the PRE_ROUTING chain
on input and the LOCAL_OUT chain on output.

The addition of a net parameter makes it explicit which network
namespace the packets are being reassembled in, and removes the need
for nf_ct_frag6_gather to guess.
