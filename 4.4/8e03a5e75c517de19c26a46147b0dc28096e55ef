sh_eth: merge sh_eth_free_dma_buffer() into sh_eth_ring_free()

While the ring allocation is done by a single function, sh_eth_ring_init(),
the ring deallocation was split into two functions (almost always called
one after the other) for no good reason. Merge  sh_eth_free_dma_buffer()
into sh_eth_ring_free() which allows us  to save space not only on the
direct calls  of the former function but also on the sh_eth_ring_init()'s
simplified error path...
