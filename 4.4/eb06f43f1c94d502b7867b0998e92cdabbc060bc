kasan: always taint kernel on report

Currently we already taint the kernel in some cases.  E.g.  if we hit some
bug in slub memory we call object_err() which will taint the kernel with
TAINT_BAD_PAGE flag.  But for other kind of bugs kernel left untainted.

Always taint with TAINT_BAD_PAGE if kasan found some bug.  This is useful
for automated testing.
