net: Allow user to get table id from route lookup

rt_fill_info which is called for 'route get' requests hardcodes the
table id as RT_TABLE_MAIN which is not correct when multiple tables
are used. Use the newly added table id in the rtable to send back
the correct table similar to what is done for IPv6.

To maintain current ABI a new request flag, RTM_F_LOOKUP_TABLE, is
added to indicate the actual table is wanted versus the hardcoded
response.
