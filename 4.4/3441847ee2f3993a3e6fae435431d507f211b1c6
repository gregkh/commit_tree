staging: wilc1000: remove meaningless line

The current driver is calling skb_reserve function to align memory in
frmw_to_linux function. However, the wrong value is used as the input argument.
Besides, the process is not necessary because the address already is algined
in dev_alloc_skb function. So, this patch removes the line for dummy headroom.
