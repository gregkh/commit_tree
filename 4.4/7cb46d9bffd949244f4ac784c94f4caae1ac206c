misc: mic: COSM client driver

The COSM client driver running on the MIC cards is implemented as a
kernel mode SCIF client. It responds to a "shutdown" message from the
host by triggering a card shutdown and also communicates the shutdown
or reboot status back the host. It is also responsible for syncing the
card time to that of the host. Because SCIF messaging cannot be used
in a panic context, the COSM client driver also periodically sends a
heartbeat SCIF message to the host thereby enabling the host to detect
card crashes.
