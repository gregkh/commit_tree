ALSA: firewire-lib: move PCM substream constraint to AM824 layer

In IEC 61883-6, PCM frames are transferred in Multi Bit Linear Audio data
channel. The data channel transfers 16/20/24 bit PCM samples. Thus, PCM
substream has a constrain about it.

This commit moves codes related to the constraint from packet streaming
layer to AM824 data block processing layer.
