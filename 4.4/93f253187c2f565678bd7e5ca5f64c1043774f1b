drm/i915/guc: Media domain bit needed when notify GuC rc6 state

GuC expects two bits for Render and Media domain separately when
driver sends data via host2guc SAMPLE_FORCEWAKE. Bit 0 is for
Render and bit 1 is for Media domain.

v2: Keep sync with code for WaRsDoubleRc6WrlWithCoarsePowerGating

v1: Add parameters definition to avoid magic value
