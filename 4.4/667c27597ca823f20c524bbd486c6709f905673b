Revert "arm64: Mark kernel page ranges contiguous"

This reverts commit 348a65cdcbbf243073ee39d1f7d4413081ad7eab.

Incorrect page table manipulation that does not respect the ARM ARM
recommended break-before-make sequence may lead to TLB conflicts. The
contiguous PTE patch makes the system even more susceptible to such
errors by changing the mapping from a single page to a contiguous range
of pages. An additional TLB invalidation would reduce the risk window,
however, the correct fix is to switch to a temporary swapper_pg_dir.
Once the correct workaround is done, the reverted commit will be
re-applied.
