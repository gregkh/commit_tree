qede: Add basic Network driver

The Qlogic Everest Driver for Ethernet is the Ethernet specific module for
QL4xxx ethernet products by Qlogic.

This patch adds a very minimal PCI driver, one that doesn't yet register
a network device, but one that does interact with qed and does a basic
initialization of the HW.
