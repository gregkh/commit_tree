crypto: 842 - Add CRC and validation support

This patch adds CRC generation and validation support for nx-842.
Add CRC flag so that nx842 coprocessor includes CRC during compression
and validates during decompression.

Also changes in 842 SW compression to append CRC value at the end
of template and checks during decompression.
