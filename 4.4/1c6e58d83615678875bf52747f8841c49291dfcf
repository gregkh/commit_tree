mmc: pwrseq: Use highest priority for eMMC restart handler

The pwrseq_emmc driver does a eMMC card reset before a system reboot to
allow broken or limited ROM boot-loaders (that don't have an eMMC reset
logic) to be able to read the second stage from the eMMC.

But this has to be called before a system reboot handler and while most
of them use the priority 128, there are other restart handlers (such as
the syscon-reboot one) that use a higher priority. So, use the highest
priority to make sure that the eMMC hw is reset before a system reboot.
