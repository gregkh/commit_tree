cgroup: implement static_key based cgroup_subsys_enabled() and cgroup_subsys_on_dfl()

Whether a subsys is enabled and attached to the default hierarchy
seldom changes and may be tested in the hot paths.  This patch
implements static_key based cgroup_subsys_enabled() and
cgroup_subsys_on_dfl() tests.

The following patches will update the users and remove duplicate
mechanisms.
