megaraid_sas: Make tape drives visible on PERC5 controllers

The DELL PERC5 controller firmware does not list tape drives in response
to MR_DCMD_PD_LIST_QUERY. This causes tape drives not be exposed to the
OS when connected to a PERC5 controller.

This patch permits detection of tape drives connected to a PERC5
controller by exposing non-TYPE_DISK devices unconditionally.
