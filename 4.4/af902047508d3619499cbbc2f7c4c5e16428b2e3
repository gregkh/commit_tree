btrfs: Move btrfs_raid_array to public

This array is used to record attributes of each raid type,
make it public, and many functions will benifit with this array.

For example, num_tolerated_disk_barrier_failures(), we can
avoid complex conditions in this function, and get raid attribute
simply by accessing above array.

It can also make code logic simple, reduce duplication code, and
increase maintainability.
