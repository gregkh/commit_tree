USB: qcserial: Fix support for HP lt4112 LTE/HSPA+ Gobi 4G Modem

The DEVICE_HWI type was added under the faulty assumption that Huawei
devices based on Qualcomm chipsets and firmware use the static USB
interface numbering known from Gobi devices.  But this model does
not apply to Huawei devices like the HP branded lt4112 (Huawei me906e).
Huawei firmwares will dynamically assign interface numbers. Functions
are renumbered when the firmware is reconfigured.

Fix by changing the DEVICE_HWI type to use a simplified version
of Huawei's subclass + protocol scheme: Blacklisting known network
interface combinations and assuming the rest are serial.
