perf tools: Adds the config_term callback for different type events

Currently, function config_term() is used for checking config terms of
all types of events, while unknown terms is not reported as an error
because pmu events have valid terms in sysfs.

But this is wrong when unknown terms are specificed to hw/sw events.
This patch Adds the config_term callback so we can use separate check
routines for each type of events.
