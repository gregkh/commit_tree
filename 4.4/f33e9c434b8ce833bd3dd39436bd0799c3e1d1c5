ARC: smp: Move default boot kick/wait code out of MCIP into common code

For non halt-on-reset case, all cores start of simultaneously in @stext.
Master core0 proceeds with kernel boot, while other spin-wait on
@wake_flag being set by master once it is ready. So NO hardware assist
is needed for master to "kick" the others.

This patch moves this soft implementation out of mcip.c (as there is no
hardware assist) into common smp.c
