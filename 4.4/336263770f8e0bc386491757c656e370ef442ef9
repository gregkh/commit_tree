ARM: dts: sun4i: Add dts file for the pov protab2-ips9 tablet

The Point of View protab2-ips9 is a tablet with a 9" ips 1024x768 lcd screen,
microsd slot, headphones, mini hdmi, mini usb b and power barrel connectors.

It uses a rtl8188cus usb wifi chip and a RDA 5875Y bluetooth chip attached
to uart2. It has a bma250 accelerometer attached to i2c1 addr 0x18, this
only works when ldo3 is set to 2.8 volt, otherwise i2c1 gets stuck, so
for now we mark i2c1 as failed.

It has a pixcir,pixcir_tangoc compatible touchscreen attached to i2c2 addr
0x5c. This is not enabled in this dts, because this variant of the
pixcir_tangoc has separate wakeup and enable pins both of which need
to be driven low before the touchscreen will work. Before we can enable
this the pixcir driver and devicetree-bindings need to be extended to
support these pins.
