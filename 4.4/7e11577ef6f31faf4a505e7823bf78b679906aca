serial: imx: re-enable DMA support without hardware flow control

The commit enabling DMA support even if no flow control is present
was reverted on the grounds that it uncovered a number of bugs in
the code that lead to hanging tty devices and/or missing characters.

After tracking down the issues it is clear that those were generic
bugs and had nothing to do with flow control being present or not,
only that allowing DMA without hardware flow control increased
the exposure of that code a lot.

Now that those bugs are fixed, it should be safe to re-enable DMA
support.
