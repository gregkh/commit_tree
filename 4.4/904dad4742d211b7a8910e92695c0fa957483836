[PATCH] fix calculation of meta_bg descriptor backups

"group" is the group where the backup will be placed, and is
initialized to zero in the declaration. This meant that backups for
meta_bg descriptors were erroneously written to the backup block group
descriptors in groups 1 and (desc_per_block-1).

Reproduction information:
  mke2fs -Fq -t ext4 -b 1024 -O ^resize_inode /tmp/foo.img 16G
  truncate -s 24G /tmp/foo.img
  losetup /dev/loop0 /tmp/foo.img
  mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
  resize2fs /dev/loop0
  umount /dev/loop0
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/loop0 bs=1024 count=2
  e2fsck -fy /dev/loop0
  losetup -d /dev/loop0
