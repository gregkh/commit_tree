xen/grant-table: Make it running on 64KB granularity

The Xen interface is using 4KB page granularity. This means that each
grant is 4KB.

The current implementation allocates a Linux page per grant. On Linux
using 64KB page granularity, only the first 4KB of the page will be
used.

We could decrease the memory wasted by sharing the page with multiple
grant. It will require some care with the {Set,Clear}ForeignPage macro.

Note that no changes has been made in the x86 code because both Linux
and Xen will only use 4KB page granularity.
