serial: 8250_ingenic: Enable FIFO for Ingenic UARTs

Enable the TX/RX FIFOs present on UARTs in Ingenic SoCs.
FIFO sizes vary per device so match these based on
the OF compatible string

Enabling the FIFOs permits much faster transfer with
lower CPU overhead.

Tested on Ingenic JZ4780 on the MIPS Ci20 Creator board
