MIPS: ralink: Add tty detection

MT7688 has several uarts that can be used for console. There are several
boards in the wild, that use ttyS1 or ttyS2. This patch applies a simply
autodetection routine to figure out which ttyS the bootloader used as
console. The uarts come up in 6 bit mode by default. The bootloader will
have set 8 bit mode on the console. Find that 8bit tty and use it.
