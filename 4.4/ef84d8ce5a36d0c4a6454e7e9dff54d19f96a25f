Revert "inet: fix double request socket freeing"

This reverts commit c69736696cf3742b37d850289dc0d7ead177bb14.

At the time of above commit, tcp_req_err() and dccp_req_err()
were dead code, as SYN_RECV request sockets were not yet in ehash table.

Real bug was fixed later in a different commit.

We need to revert to not leak a refcount on request socket.

inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop_and_put() will be added
in following commit to make clean inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop()
does not release the reference owned by caller.
