inet netfilter: Prefer state->hook to ops->hooknum

The values of nf_hook_state.hook and nf_hook_ops.hooknum must be the
same by definition.

We are more likely to access the fields in nf_hook_state over the
fields in nf_hook_ops so with a little luck this results in
fewer cache line misses, and slightly more consistent code.
