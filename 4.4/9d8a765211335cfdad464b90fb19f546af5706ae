kernel/signal.c: unexport sigsuspend()

sigsuspend() is nowhere used except in signal.c itself, so we can mark it
static do not pollute the global namespace.

But this patch is more than a boring cleanup patch, it fixes a real issue
on UserModeLinux.  UML has a special console driver to display ttys using
xterm, or other terminal emulators, on the host side.  Vegard reported
that sometimes UML is unable to spawn a xterm and he's facing the
following warning:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 908 at include/linux/thread_info.h:128 sigsuspend+0xab/0xc0()

It turned out that this warning makes absolutely no sense as the UML
xterm code calls sigsuspend() on the host side, at least it tries.  But
as the kernel itself offers a sigsuspend() symbol the linker choose this
one instead of the glibc wrapper.  Interestingly this code used to work
since ever but always blocked signals on the wrong side.  Some recent
kernel change made the WARN_ON() trigger and uncovered the bug.

It is a wonderful example of how much works by chance on computers. :-)
