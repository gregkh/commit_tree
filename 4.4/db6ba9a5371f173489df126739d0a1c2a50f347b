net: mvneta: add configuration for MBUS windows access protection

This commit adds missing configuration of MBUS windows access protection
in mvneta_conf_mbus_windows function - a dedicated variable for that
purpose remained there unused since v3.8 initial mvneta support. Because
of that the register contents were inherited from the bootloader.
