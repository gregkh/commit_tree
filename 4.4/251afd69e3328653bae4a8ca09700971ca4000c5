s390/dasd: fix invalid PAV assignment after suspend/resume

For a valid PAV assignment the DASD driver needs to notice possibly
changed configuration data. Thus the failing of read configuration
data should also fail the device restore to prevent invalid PAV
assignment. The failed device may get restored after additional paths
get available later on.
If the restore fails after the device was added to the lcu alias
handling it needs to be removed from the alias handling before exiting
the restore function.
