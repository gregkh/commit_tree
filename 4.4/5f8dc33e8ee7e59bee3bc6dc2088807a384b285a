net: fix feature changes on devices without ndo_set_features

When __netdev_update_features() was updated to ensure some features are
disabled on new lower devices, an error was introduced for devices which
don't have the ndo_set_features() method set. Before we'll just set the
new features, but now we return an error and don't set them. Fix this by
returning the old behaviour and setting err to 0 when ndo_set_features
is not present.
