staging: rtl8188eu: fix misleading indentation

Code is correct, i needs to be moved back by 2 to correct for the last
iteration of the while loop, since READ_NEXT_PAIR advances two. Fixing
the misleading indentation.

Fix a smatch warning:
drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/hal/rf_cfg.c:217
rtl88e_phy_config_rf_with_headerfile() warn: curly braces intended?
