PM / Domains: Remove pm_genpd_poweron() API

Once genpd could be configured to be built with CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME unset
(nowadays CONFIG_PM), the pm_genpd_poweron() API served a purpose, since
it allowed users to power on a PM domain.

As such configuration no longer is supported, users shall solely rely on
using some of the runtime PM APIs to power on a PM domain.
