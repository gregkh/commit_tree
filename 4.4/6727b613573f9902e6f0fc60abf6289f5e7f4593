misc: mic: COSM SCIF server

The COSM driver communicates with the MIC cards over SCIF. A SCIF
"server" listens for incoming connections from "client" MIC cards as
they boot. After the connection is accepted a separate work item is
scheduled for each MIC card. This work item normally stays blocked in
scif_poll but wakes up to process messages from the card.

The SCIF connection between the host and card COSM components is used
to (a) send the command to shut down the card (b) receive shutdown
status back from the card upon completion of shutdown (c) receive
periodic heartbeat messages to detect card crashes (d) send host time
to the card to enable the card to sync its time to the host.
