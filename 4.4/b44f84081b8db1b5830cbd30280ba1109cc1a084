drm: Stop using drm_vblank_count() as the hw frame counter

drm_vblank_count() returns the software counter. We should not pretend
it's the hw counter since we use the hw counter to figuere out what the
software counter value should be. So instead provide a new function
drm_vblank_no_hw_counter() for drivers that don't have a real hw
counter. The new function simply returns 0, which is about the only
thing it can do.
