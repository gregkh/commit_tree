cgroup: replace cftype->mode with CFTYPE_WORLD_WRITABLE

cftype->mode allows controllers to give arbitrary permissions to
interface knobs.  Except for "cgroup.event_control", the existing uses
are spurious.

* Some explicitly specify S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR even though that's the
  default.

* "cpuset.memory_pressure" specifies S_IRUGO while also setting a
  write callback which returns -EACCES.  All it needs to do is simply
  not setting a write callback.

"cgroup.event_control" uses cftype->mode to make the file
world-writable.  It's a misdesigned interface and we don't want
controllers to be tweaking interface file permissions in general.
This patch removes cftype->mode and all its spurious uses and
implements CFTYPE_WORLD_WRITABLE for "cgroup.event_control" which is
marked as compatibility-only.
