ALSA: firewire-lib: move MIDI trigger helper function to AM824 layer

In IEC 61883-6, MIDI messages are transferred in MIDI conformant data
channel. Essentially, packet streaming layer is not responsible for MIDI
functionality.

This commit moves MIDI trigger helper function from the layer to AM824
layer. The rest of codes related to MIDI functionality will be moved in
later commits.
