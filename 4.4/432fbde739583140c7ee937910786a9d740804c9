staging: comedi: add new comedi_buf_write_n_available()

Add a new function `comedi_buf_write_n_available()` to return the amount
of buffer space available for writing, including space already allocated
by `comedi_buf_write_alloc()` plus any unallocated space available.
This is currently just for internal use by the comedi core, so is not
exported.
