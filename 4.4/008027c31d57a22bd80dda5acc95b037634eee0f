netfilter: turn NF_HOOK into an inline function

A recent change to the dst_output handling caused a new warning
when the call to NF_HOOK() is the only used of a local variable
passed as 'dev', and CONFIG_NETFILTER is disabled:

net/ipv6/ip6_output.c: In function 'ip6_output':
net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:135:21: warning: unused variable 'dev' [-Wunused-variable]

The reason for this is that the NF_HOOK macro in this case does
not reference the variable at all, and the call to dev_net(dev)
got removed from the ip6_output function. To avoid that warning now
and in the future, this changes the macro into an equivalent
inline function, which tells the compiler that the variable is
passed correctly but still unused.

The dn_forward function apparently had the same problem in
the past and added a local workaround that no longer works
with the inline function. In order to avoid a regression, we
have to also remove the #ifdef from decnet in the same patch.
