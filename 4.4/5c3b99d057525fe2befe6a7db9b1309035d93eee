PCI: dra7xx: Mark driver as broken

Mark the dra7xx PCI host driver as broken.  This driver was first merged in
v3.17 and has never worked.  Although the driver compiles just fine, it is
missing an essential device reset.  If the driver is included, the kernel
locks up hard shortly after booting, before any console output appears.
