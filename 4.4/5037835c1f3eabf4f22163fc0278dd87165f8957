coredump: add DAX filtering for ELF coredumps

Add two new flags to the existing coredump mechanism for ELF files to
allow us to explicitly filter DAX mappings.  This is desirable because
DAX mappings, like hugetlb mappings, have the potential to be very
large.

Update the coredump_filter documentation in
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt so that it addresses the new DAX
coredump flags.  Also update the documented default value of
coredump_filter to be consistent with the core(5) man page.  The
documentation being updated talks about bit 4, Dump ELF headers, which
is enabled if CONFIG_CORE_DUMP_DEFAULT_ELF_HEADERS is turned on in the
kernel config.  This kernel config option defaults to "y" if both ELF
binaries and coredump are enabled.
