Revert "ACPI / SBS: Add 5 us delay to fix SBS hangs on MacBook"

Revert commit 3349fb64b292 (ACPI / SBS: Add 5 us delay to fix SBS
hangs on MacBook), since the delay introduced by it is not necessary
any more after commit add68d6aa9e2 (ACPI / SMBus: Fix boot stalls /
high CPU caused by reentrant code).
