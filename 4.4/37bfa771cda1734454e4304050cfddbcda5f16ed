PCI: mvebu: Fix memory leaks and refcount leaks

The mvebu PCI port parsing is weak due to:

1) allocations via kasprintf() were not cleaned up when we encounter an
   error or decide to skip the port.
2) kasprintf() wasn't checked for failure.
3) of_get_named_gpio_flags() returns EPROBE_DEFER if the GPIO is not
   present, not devm_gpio_request_one().
4) the of_node was not being put when terminating the loop.

Fix these oversights.
