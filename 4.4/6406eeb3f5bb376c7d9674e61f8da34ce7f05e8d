usb: Quiet down false peer failure messages

My recent Intel box is spewing these messages:

xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: xHCI Host Controller
xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 2

Diving into the acpi tables, I noticed the EHCI hub has 12 ports while the XHCI
hub has 8 ports.  Most of those ports are of connect type USB_PORT_NOT_USED
(including port 1 of the EHCI hub).

Further the unused ports have location data initialized to 0x80000000.

Now each unused port on the xhci hub walks the port list and finds a matching
peer with port1 of the EHCI hub because the zero'd out group id bits falsely match.
After port1 of the XHCI hub, each following matching peer will generate the
above warning.

These warnings seem to be harmless for this scenario as I don't think it
matters that unused ports could not create a peer link.

The attached patch utilizes that assumption and just turns the pr_warn into
pr_debug to quiet things down.

Tested on my Intel box.
