mm/mlock.c: reorganize mlockall() return values and remove goto-out label

In mlockall syscall wrapper after out-label for goto code just doing
return.  Remove goto out statements and return error values directly.

Also instead of rewriting ret variable before every if-check move returns
to 'error'-like path under if-check.

Objdump asm listing showed me reducing by few asm lines.  Object file size
descreased from 220592 bytes to 220528 bytes for me (for aarch64).
