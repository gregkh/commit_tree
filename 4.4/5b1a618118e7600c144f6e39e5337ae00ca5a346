ARM: Fix broken USB support in multi_v7_defconfig for sunxi devices

Commit 69fb4dcada77 ("power: Add an axp20x-usb-power driver") introduced a
new driver for the USB power supply used on various Allwinner based SBCs.
However, the driver was not added to multi_v7_defconfig which breaks USB
support for some boards (e.g. LeMaker BananaPi) as the kernel will now
turn off the USB power supply during boot by default if the driver isn't
present. (This was not the case in linux 4.3 or lower where the USB power
was always left on.)

Hence, add the driver to multi_v7_defconfig in order to keep USB support
working on those boards that require it.
