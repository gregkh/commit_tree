mm/filemap.c: make global sync not clear error status of individual inodes

filemap_fdatawait() is a function to wait for on-going writeback to
complete but also consume and clear error status of the mapping set during
writeback.

The latter functionality is critical for applications to detect writeback
error with system calls like fsync(2)/fdatasync(2).

However filemap_fdatawait() is also used by sync(2) or FIFREEZE ioctl,
which don't check error status of individual mappings.

As a result, fsync() may not be able to detect writeback error if events
happen in the following order:

   Application                    System admin
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   write data on page cache
                                  Run sync command
                                  writeback completes with error
                                  filemap_fdatawait() clears error
   fsync returns success
   (but the data is not on disk)

This patch adds filemap_fdatawait_keep_errors() for call sites where
writeback error is not handled so that they don't clear error status.
