rcu: Stop excluding CPU hotplug in synchronize_sched_expedited()

Now that synchronize_sched_expedited() uses IPIs, a hook in
rcu_sched_qs(), and the ->expmask field in the rcu_node combining
tree, it is no longer necessary to exclude CPU hotplug.  Any
races with CPU hotplug will be detected when attempting to send
the IPI.  This commit therefore removes the code excluding
CPU hotplug operations.
