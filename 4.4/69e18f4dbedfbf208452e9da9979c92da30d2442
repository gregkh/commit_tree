zpool: remove redundant zpool->type string, const-ify zpool_get_type

Make the return type of zpool_get_type const; the string belongs to the
zpool driver and should not be modified.  Remove the redundant type field
in the struct zpool; it is private to zpool.c and isn't needed since
->driver->type can be used directly.  Add comments indicating strings must
be null-terminated.
