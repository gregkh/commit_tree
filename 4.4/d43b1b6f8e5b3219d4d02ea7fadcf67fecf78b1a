cpufreq : powernv: Report Pmax throttling if capped below nominal frequency

Log a 'critical' message if the max frequency is reduced below nominal
frequency. We already log 'info' message if the max frequency is
capped below turbo frequency. CPU should guarantee atleast nominal
frequency, but not turbo frequency in all system configurations and
environments. So report the pmax throttling with severity when Pmax is
dipped below nominal frequency.
