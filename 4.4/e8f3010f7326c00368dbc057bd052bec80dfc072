arm64/efi: isolate EFI stub from the kernel proper

Since arm64 does not use a builtin decompressor, the EFI stub is built
into the kernel proper. So far, this has been working fine, but actually,
since the stub is in fact a PE/COFF relocatable binary that is executed
at an unknown offset in the 1:1 mapping provided by the UEFI firmware, we
should not be seamlessly sharing code with the kernel proper, which is a
position dependent executable linked at a high virtual offset.

So instead, separate the contents of libstub and its dependencies, by
putting them into their own namespace by prefixing all of its symbols
with __efistub. This way, we have tight control over what parts of the
kernel proper are referenced by the stub.
