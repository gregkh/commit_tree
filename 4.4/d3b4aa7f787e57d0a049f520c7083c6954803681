ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: improve multi_v7_defconfig support for Berlin

Some drivers used on a Marvell Berlin kernel were missing from
multi_v7_defconfig. This series add them:

  * The pxa168 Ethernet driver is added as a loadable module.
  * The Berlin ADC driver is added as a loadable module.
  * Both the Berlin USB PHY and SATA PHY drivers are added,
    built-in, as they are required for the already available USB
    and SATA functionalities in multi_v7_defconfig.
