drm/i915: Add a tracepoint for the shrinker

Often it is very useful to know why we suddenly purge vast tracts of
memory and surprisingly up until now we didn't even have a tracepoint
for when we shrink our memory.

Note that there are slab_start/end tracepoints already, but those
don't cover the internal recursion when we directly call into our
shrinker code. Hence a separate tracepoint seems justified. Also note
that we don't really need a separate tracepoint for the actual amount
of pages freed since we already have an unbind tracpoint for that.

insufficient.]
