vfio: platform: add capability to register a reset function

In preparation for subsequent changes in reset function lookup,
lets introduce a dynamic list of reset combos (compat string,
reset module, reset function). The list can be populated/voided with
vfio_platform_register/unregister_reset. Those are not yet used in
this patch.
