btrfs: extend balance filter limit to take minimum and maximum

The 'limit' filter is underdesigned, it should have been a range for
[min,max], with some relaxed semantics when one of the bounds is
missing. Besides that, using a full u64 for a single value is a waste of
bytes.

Let's fix both by extending the use of the u64 bytes for the [min,max]
range. This can be done in a backward compatible way, the range will be
interpreted only if the appropriate flag is set
(BTRFS_BALANCE_ARGS_LIMIT_RANGE).
