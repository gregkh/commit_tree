[media] s5p-jpeg: generalize clocks handling

Allow jpeg codec variants declare clocks they need.
Before this patch is applied jpeg-core gets jpeg->sclk
"speculatively": if it is not there, we assume no problem.

This patch eliminates this by explicitly declaring
what clocks are needed for each variant.

This is a preparation for adding Exynos 5433 variant support, which
needs 4 clocks of names not compatible with any previous version of
jpeg hw module.
