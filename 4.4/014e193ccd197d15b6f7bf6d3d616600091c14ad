clk: qcom: gdsc: Add support for Memory RET/OFF

Along with the GDSC power switch, there is additional control
to either retain all memory (core and peripheral) within a given
powerdomain or to turn them off while the GDSC is powered down.
Add support for these by modelling a RET state where all
memory is retained and an OFF state where all memory gets turned
off.
The controls provided are granular enough to be able to support
various differnt levels of RET states, like a 'shallow RET' with all memory
retained and a 'deep RET' with some memory retained while some others
are lost. The current patch does not support this and considers
just one RET state where all memory is retained. Futher work, if
needed can support multiple different levels of RET state.
