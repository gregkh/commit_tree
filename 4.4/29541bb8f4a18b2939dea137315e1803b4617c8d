KVM: VMX: simplify invpcid handling in vmx_cpuid_update()

If vmx_invpcid_supported() is true, second execution control
filed must be supported and SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_INVPCID
must have already been set in current vmcs by
vmx_secondary_exec_control()

If vmx_invpcid_supported() is false, no need to clear
SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_INVPCID
