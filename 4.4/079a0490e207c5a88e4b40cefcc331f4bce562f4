ath10k: introduce dev_id to hw_params

A follow up patch introducing a QCA9377 hw1.0 support will need
this device identification helper for an explicit distinction of
HWs, as apparently both QCA6174 hw3.0 and QCA9377 share the same BMI
target version (0x0502000x). For the QCA9377 hw1.1 previously
added we were just lucky we did not overlap with the same chip_id_rev.
