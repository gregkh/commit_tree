kbuild: document recursive dependency limitation / resolution

Recursive dependency issues with kconfig are unavoidable due to
some limitations with kconfig, since these issues are recurring
provide a hint to the user how they can resolve these dependency
issues and also document why such limitation exists.

While at it also document a bit of future prospects of ways to
enhance Kconfig, including providing formal semantics and evaluation
of use of a SAT solver. If you're interested in this work or prospects
of it check out the kconfig-sat project wiki [0] and mailing list [1].
