HID: wacom: fixup quirks setup for WACOM_DEVICETYPE_PAD

Given that INTUOSHT < BAMBOO_PT

	features->type >= INTUOSHT || features->type <= BAMBOO_PT

condition is always true, and therefore device_type is under certain
circumstances wrongly set with WACOM_DEVICETYPE_PAD bit set.

Fix the condition so that it actually represents the range as intended.
