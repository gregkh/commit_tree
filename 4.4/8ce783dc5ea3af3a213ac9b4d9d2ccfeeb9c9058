Bluetooth: Fix missing hdev locking for LE scan cleanup

The hci_conn objects don't have a dedicated lock themselves but rely
on the caller to hold the hci_dev lock for most types of access. The
hci_conn_timeout() function has so far sent certain HCI commands based
on the hci_conn state which has been possible without holding the
hci_dev lock.

The recent changes to do LE scanning before connect attempts added
even more operations to hci_conn and hci_dev from hci_conn_timeout,
thereby exposing potential race conditions with the hci_dev and
hci_conn states.

As an example of such a race, here there's a timeout but an
l2cap_sock_connect() call manages to race with the cleanup routine:

[  +0.000003] hci_conn_hold: hcon f53d56e0 orig refcnt 0

Above the l2cap_chan_connect() shouldn't have been able to reach the
hci_conn f53d56e0 anymore but since hci_conn_timeout didn't do proper
locking that's not the case. The end result is a reference to hci_conn
that's not in the conn_hash list, resulting in list corruption when
trying to remove it later:

The necessary fix is unfortunately more complicated than just adding
hci_dev_lock/unlock calls to the hci_conn_timeout() call path.
Particularly, the hci_conn_del() API, which expects the hci_dev lock to
be held, performs a cancel_delayed_work_sync(&hcon->disc_work) which
would lead to a deadlock if the hci_conn_timeout() call path tries to
acquire the same lock.

This patch solves the problem by deferring the cleanup work to a
separate work callback. To protect against the hci_dev or hci_conn
going away meanwhile temporary references are taken with the help of
hci_dev_hold() and hci_conn_get().
