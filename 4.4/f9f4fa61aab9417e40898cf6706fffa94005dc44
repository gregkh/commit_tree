ASoC: fsl_spdif: Add driver suspend and resume to support MEGA Fast

For i.MX6 SoloX, there is a mode of the SoC to shutdown all power source of
modules during system suspend and resume procedure. Thus, SPDIF needs to save
all the values of registers before the system suspend and restore them after
the system resume.

The SRPC register should be volatile, LOCK bit is set by the hardware.
