s390/dasd: fix disconnected device with valid path mask

Path verification is either done via dasd_eckd_read_conf() which is
triggered during online processing and resume or via
do_path_verification_work() which is triggered after path events.
The dasd_eckd_read_conf() version added paths unconditionally and did
not check if the path mask was empty. This led to devices having the
disconnected stop flag set but a valid path mask. So they where not
working although they had paths validated successfully. After a resume
this state could even not be solved with additional paths added.

Fix by checking for an empty path mask in dasd_eckd_read_conf() and
clearing the device stop bits for a newly added channel path.
