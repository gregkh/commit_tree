pwm: atmel-hlcdc: Fix module autoload for OF platform driver

This platform driver has a OF device ID table but the OF module alias
information is not created so module autoloading won't work.

This patch adds the missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() for OF to export that
information so modules have the correct aliases built-in and autoloading
works correctly.
