can: flexcan: rename feature into quirks

This patch renames the "features" member of struct flexcan_devtype_data to
"quirks". The corresponding defines are renamed too, to reflect what they
actually do.

    FLEXCAN_HAS_V10_FEATURES      -> FLEXCAN_QUIRK_DISABLE_RXFG
    FLEXCAN_HAS_BROKEN_ERR_STATE  -> FLEXCAN_QUIRK_BROKEN_ERR_STATE
    FLEXCAN_HAS_MECR_FEATURES     -> FLEXCAN_QUIRK_DISABLE_MECR
