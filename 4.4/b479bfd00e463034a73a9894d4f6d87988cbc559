DocBook: Use a fixed encoding for output

Currently the encoding of documents generated by DocBook depends on
the current locale.  Make the output reproducible independently of
the locale, by setting the encoding to UTF-8 (LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8) by
preference, or ASCII (LC_CTYPE=C) as a fallback.

LC_CTYPE can normally be overridden by LC_ALL, but the top-level
Makefile unsets that.
