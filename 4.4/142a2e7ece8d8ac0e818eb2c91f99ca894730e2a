tcp: initialize tp->copied_seq in case of cross SYN connection

Dmitry provided a syzkaller (http://github.com/google/syzkaller)
generated program that triggers the WARNING at
net/ipv4/tcp.c:1729 in tcp_recvmsg() :

WARN_ON(tp->copied_seq != tp->rcv_nxt &&
        !(flags & (MSG_PEEK | MSG_TRUNC)));

His program is specifically attempting a Cross SYN TCP exchange,
that we support (for the pleasure of hackers ?), but it looks we
lack proper tcp->copied_seq initialization.

Thanks again Dmitry for your report and testings.
