parisc: Fixes and cleanups in kernel uapi header files

This patch fixes some bugs and partly cleans up the parisc uapi header
files to what glibc defined:
- compat_semid64_ds was wrong and did not take the endianess into
  account
- ipc64_perm exported userspace types which broke building userspace
  packages on debian (e.g. trinity)
- ipc64_perm needs to use a 32bit mode_t on 64bit kernel
- msqid64_ds and semid64_ds needs unsigned longs for various struct members
- shmid64_ds exported size_t instead of __kernel_size_t

And finally add some compile-time checks for the sizes of those structs
to avoid future breakage.

Runtime-tested with the Linux Test Project (LTP) testsuite.
