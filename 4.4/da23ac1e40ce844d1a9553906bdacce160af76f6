ALSA: hda - Add hduadio support to DEVTABLE

For generating modalias entries automatically, move the definition of
struct hda_device_id to linux/mod_devicetable.h and add the handling
of this record in file2alias helper.  The new modalias is represented
with combination of vendor id, device id, and api version as
"hdaudio:vNrNaN".

This patch itself doesn't convert the existing modaliases.  Since they
were added manually, this patch won't give any regression by itself at
this point.

[Modified the modalias format to adapt the api_version field, and drop
 invalid ANY_ID definition by tiwai]
