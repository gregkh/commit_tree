TPM: remove unnecessary little endian conversion

The base pointer for the event log is allocated in the local
kernel (in prom_instantiate_sml()), therefore it is already in
the host's endian byte order and requires no conversion.

The content of the 'basep' pointer in read_log() stores the
base address of the log. This patch ensures that it is correctly
implemented.
