drm/i915: Avoid GPU stalls from kswapd

Exclude active GPU pages from the purview of the background shrinker
(kswapd), as these cause uncontrollable GPU stalls. Given that the
shrinker is rerun until the freelists are satisfied, we should have
opportunity in subsequent passes to recover the pages once idle. If the
machine does run out of memory entirely, we have the forced idling in the
oom-notifier as a means of releasing all the pages we can before an oom
is prematurely executed.

Note that this relies upon an up-front retire_requests to keep the
inactive list in shape, which was added in a previous patch, mostly as
execlist ctx pinning band-aids.
