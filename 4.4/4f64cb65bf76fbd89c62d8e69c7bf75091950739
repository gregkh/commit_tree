arm/arm64: KVM: Only allow 64bit hosts to build VGICv3

Hardware virtualisation of GICv3 is only supported by 64bit hosts for
the moment. Some VGICv3 bits are missing from the 32bit side, and this
patch allows to still be able to build 32bit hosts when CONFIG_ARM_GIC_V3
is selected.

To this end, we introduce a new option, CONFIG_KVM_ARM_VGIC_V3, that is
only enabled on the 64bit side. The selection is done unconditionally
because CONFIG_ARM_GIC_V3 is always enabled on arm64.
