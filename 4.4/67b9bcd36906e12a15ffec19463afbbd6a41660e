mtd: spi-nor: fix Spansion regressions (aliased with Winbond)

Spansion and Winbond have occasionally used the same manufacturer ID,
and they don't support the same features. Particularly, writing SR=0
seems to break read access for Spansion's s25fl064k. Unfortunately, we
don't currently have a way to differentiate these Spansion and Winbond
parts, so rather than regressing support for these Spansion flash, let's
drop the new Winbond lock/unlock support for now. We can try to address
Winbond support during the next release cycle.
