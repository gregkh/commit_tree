netfilter: ipset: Fix extension alignment

The data extensions in ipset lacked the proper memory alignment and
thus could lead to kernel crash on several architectures. Therefore
the structures have been reorganized and alignment attributes added
where needed. The patch was tested on armv7h by Gerhard Wiesinger and
on x86_64, sparc64 by Jozsef Kadlecsik.
