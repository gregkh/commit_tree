ipv6: Avoid creating RTF_CACHE from a rt that is not managed by fib6 tree

The original bug report:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1272571

The setup has a IPv4 GRE tunnel running in a IPSec.  The bug
happens when ndisc starts sending router solicitation at the gre
interface.  The simplified oops stack is like:

__lock_acquire+0x1b2/0x1c30
lock_acquire+0xb9/0x140
_raw_write_lock_bh+0x3f/0x50
__ip6_ins_rt+0x2e/0x60
ip6_ins_rt+0x49/0x50
~~~~~~~~
__ip6_rt_update_pmtu.part.54+0x145/0x250
ip6_rt_update_pmtu+0x2e/0x40
~~~~~~~~
ip_tunnel_xmit+0x1f1/0xf40
__gre_xmit+0x7a/0x90
ipgre_xmit+0x15a/0x220
dev_hard_start_xmit+0x2bd/0x480
__dev_queue_xmit+0x696/0x730
dev_queue_xmit+0x10/0x20
neigh_direct_output+0x11/0x20
ip6_finish_output2+0x21f/0x770
ip6_finish_output+0xa7/0x1d0
ip6_output+0x56/0x190
~~~~~~~~
ndisc_send_skb+0x1d9/0x400
ndisc_send_rs+0x88/0xc0
~~~~~~~~

The rt passed to ip6_rt_update_pmtu() is created by
icmp6_dst_alloc() and it is not managed by the fib6 tree,
so its rt6i_table == NULL.  When __ip6_rt_update_pmtu() creates
a RTF_CACHE clone, the newly created clone also has rt6i_table == NULL
and it causes the ip6_ins_rt() oops.

During pmtu update, we only want to create a RTF_CACHE clone
from a rt which is currently managed (or owned) by the
fib6 tree.  It means either rt->rt6i_node != NULL or
rt is a RTF_PCPU clone.

It is worth to note that rt6i_table may not be NULL even it is
not (yet) managed by the fib6 tree (e.g. addrconf_dst_alloc()).
Hence, rt6i_node is a better check instead of rt6i_table.
