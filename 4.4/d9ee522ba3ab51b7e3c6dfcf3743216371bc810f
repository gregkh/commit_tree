Btrfs: fix qgroup sanity tests

With my changes to allow us to find old roots when resolving indirect refs I
introduced a regression to the sanity tests.  Since we don't really care to go
down into the fs roots we just need to have the old behavior of returning ENOENT
for dummy roots for the sanity tests.  In the future if we want to get fancy we
can populate the test fs trees with the references as well.  Thanks,
