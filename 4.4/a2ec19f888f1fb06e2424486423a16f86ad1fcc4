can: remove obsolete assignment for CAN protocol error type

The assignment 'cf->data[2] |= CAN_ERR_PROT_UNSPEC' used at CAN error message
creation time is obsolete as CAN_ERR_PROT_UNSPEC is zero and cf->data[2] is
initialized with zero in alloc_can_err_skb() anyway.

So we could either assign 'cf->data[2] = CAN_ERR_PROT_UNSPEC' correctly or we
can remove the obsolete OR operation entirely.
