PM / PCI / ACPI: Kick devices that might have been reset by firmware

There is a concern that if the platform firmware was involved in
the system resume that's being completed,  some devices might have
been reset by it and if those devices had the power.direct_complete
flag set during the preceding suspend transition, they may stay
in a reset-power-on state indefinitely (until they are runtime-resumed
and then suspended again).  That may not be a big deal from the
individual device's perspective, but if the system is an SoC, it may
be prevented from entering deep SoC-wide low-power states on idle
because of that.

The devices that are most likely to be affected by this issue are
PCI devices and ACPI-enumerated devices using the general ACPI PM
domain, so to prevent it from happening for those devices, force a
runtime resume for them if they have their power.direct_complete
flags set and the platform firmware was involved in the resume
transition currently in progress.
