ocfs2: fill in the unused portion of the block with zeros by dio_zero_block()

A simplified test case is (this case from Ryan):
1) dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/hello bs=512 count=1 oflag=direct;
2) truncate /mnt/hello -s 2097152
file 'hello' is not exist before test. After this command,
file 'hello' should be all zero. But 512~4096 is some random data.

Setting bh state to new when get a new block, if so,
direct_io_worker()->dio_zero_block() will fill-in the unused portion
of the block with zero.
