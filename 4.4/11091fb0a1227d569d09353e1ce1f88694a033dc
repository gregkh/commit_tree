pinctrl: qcom: ssbi: fix compilation with DEBUG_FS=n

The DEBUG_FS=n #defines for the dbg_show functions were missed when
renaming the driver from msm_ to pm8xxx_, causing it to break the build
when DEBUG_FS isn't enabled:

  CC [M]  drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-ssbi-gpio.o
drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-ssbi-gpio.c:597:14: error: â€˜pm8xxx_gpio_dbg_showâ€™ undeclared here (not in a function)
  .dbg_show = pm8xxx_gpio_dbg_show,

Fix this by renaming them correctly.
