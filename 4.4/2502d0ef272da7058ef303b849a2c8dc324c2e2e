net: mvneta: Fix CPU_MAP registers initialisation

The CPU_MAP register is duplicated for each CPUs at different addresses,
each instance being at a different address.

However, the code so far was using CONFIG_NR_CPUS to initialise the CPU_MAP
registers for each registers, while the SoCs embed at most 4 CPUs.

This is especially an issue with multi_v7_defconfig, where CONFIG_NR_CPUS
is currently set to 16, resulting in writes to registers that are not
CPU_MAP.
