staging: wilc1000: host_interface.c : remove over-commenting

There are over-commenting in the host_interface.c file and most of them
are not helpful to explain what the code does and generate 80 ending
line over warnings. So, all of comments are removed in this patch and the
comments will later be added if necessary with the preferred Linux style.
