mtip32xx: use formatting capability of kthread_create_on_node

kthread_create_on_node takes format+args, so there's no need to do the
pretty-printing in advance. Moreover, "mtip_svc_thd_99" (including its
'\0') only just fits in 16 bytes, so if index could ever go above 99
we'd have a stack buffer overflow.
