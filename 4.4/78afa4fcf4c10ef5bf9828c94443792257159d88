ARM: pxa: magician: Move platform_add_devices() to the end of magician_init()

This patch moves platform_add_devices() (standard declaration of devices)
outside of the platform specific device declarations. Moving to the end
of the magician_init() clarifies the source code (standard and specific
declaration are not mixed).
