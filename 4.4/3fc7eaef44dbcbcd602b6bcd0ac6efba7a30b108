mmc: dw_mmc: Add external dma interface support

DesignWare MMC Controller can supports two types of DMA
mode: external dma and internal dma. We get a RK312x platform
integrated dw_mmc and ARM pl330 dma controller. This patch add
edmac ops to support these platforms. I've tested it on RK31xx
platform with edmac mode and RK3288 platform with idmac mode.
