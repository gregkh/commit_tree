    drm/i915/gtt: Allocate va range only if vma is not bound

While at it implement an improved version suggested by Chris which
avoids the double-bind irrespective of what type of bind is done
first.

Note that this exact bug was already addressed in

but the problem is still that originally in

    drm/i915: Fix up the vma aliasing ppgtt binding

if forgotten to take into account there case where we have a
GLOBAL_BIND before a LOCAL_BIND. This patch here fixes that.

v2: Pimp commit message and revert the partial fix.

v3: Split into two functions to specialize on aliasing_ppgtt y/n.

v4: WARN_ON for paranoia in the init sequence, since the ggtt probe
and aliasing ppgtt setup are far apart.

v5: Style nits.
