hwmon: (scpi) skip unsupported sensors properly

Currently it's assumed that firmware exports only the class of sensors
supported by the driver. However with newer firmware or SCPI protocol
revision, support for newer classes of sensors can be present.

The driver fails to probe with the following warning if an unsupported
class of sensor is encountered in the firmware.

sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename
	'/devices/platform/scpi/scpi:sensors/hwmon/hwmon0/'
------------[ cut here ]------------
WARNING: at fs/sysfs/dir.c:31
Modules linked in:

CPU: 0 PID: 6 Comm: kworker/u12:0 Not tainted 4.3.0-rc7 #137
Hardware name: ARM Juno development board (r0) (DT)
Workqueue: deferwq deferred_probe_work_func
PC is at sysfs_warn_dup+0x54/0x78
LR is at sysfs_warn_dup+0x54/0x78

This patch fixes the above issue by skipping through the unsupported
class of SCPI sensors.
