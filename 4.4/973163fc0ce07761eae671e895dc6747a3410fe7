f2fs: reorganize f2fs_map_blocks

In this patch, we try to reorganize f2fs_map_blocks to make block mapping
flow more clear by using following structure:

/* check status of mapping */

if (unmapped) {
	/* blkaddr == NULL_ADDR || blkaddr == NEW_ADDR */

	if (create) {
		/* write path, handle dio write case here */
		alloc_and_map;
	} else {
		/*
		 * handle read cases from all call paths:
		 *     1. generic read;
		 *     2. dio read;
		 *     3. fiemap;
		 *     4. bmap
		 */
	}
}

/* map buffer_header */

Besides, this patch handles the missing case correctly for dio write:
When we fail in __allocate_data_blocks, then in f2fs_map_blocks, we will
not allocate blocks correctly for preallocated blocks, but returning with
an unmapped buffer head, which will result in failure of dio write.
