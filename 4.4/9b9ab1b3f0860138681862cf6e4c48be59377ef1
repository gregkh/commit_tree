tty: r3964: Use tty->read_wait waitqueue

The tty core provides read_wait waitqueue specifically for line
disciplines to wait readers; otherwise, the line discipline may
miss wakeups generated by the tty core.

NB: The tty core already provides serialization for the line discipline's
close() method, and guarantees no readers or writers will be using the
closing instance of the line discipline. Completely remove that wakeup.
