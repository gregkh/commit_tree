ARM: pxa: magician: Fix platform data for both PXA27x I2C controllers

This patch changes fast_mode settings for the normal and power I2C
controller on the HTC Magician machine.

Connected device on the Power I2C:
- MAX1587A: working in the fast mode

Connected devices on the Normal I2C:
- UDA1380: working in the fast mode
- OV9640: bus became stuck in the fast mode

The OV9640 is not using a standard I2C protocol, but an SCCB variant. Maybe
it is not fully compatible in the fast mode. Therefore fast mode for normal
I2C is disabled. If you not using the OV9640 then you can enable the fast
mode for the UDA1380.
