xen-netfront: always set num queues if possible

If netfront connects with two (or more) queues and then reconnects with
only one queue it fails to delete or rewrite the multi-queue-num-queues
key and netback will try to use the wrong number of queues.

Always write the num-queues field if the backend has multi-queue support.
