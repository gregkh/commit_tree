md-cluster: Use a small window for resync

Suspending the entire device for resync could take too long. Resync
in small chunks.

cluster's resync window (32M) is maintained in r1conf as
cluster_sync_low and cluster_sync_high and processed in
raid1's sync_request(). If the current resync is outside the cluster
resync window:

1. Set the cluster_sync_low to curr_resync_completed.
2. Check if the sync will fit in the new window, if not issue a
   wait_barrier() and set cluster_sync_low to sector_nr.
3. Set cluster_sync_high to cluster_sync_low + resync_window.
4. Send a message to all nodes so they may add it in their suspension
   list.

bitmap_cond_end_sync is modified to allow to force a sync inorder
to get the curr_resync_completed uptodate with the sector passed.
