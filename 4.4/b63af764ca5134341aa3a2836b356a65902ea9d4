ARM: dts: rockchip: add the support power-domain node on RK3288 SoCs

We can add more domains node in the future.
This patch add the needed clocks into power-controller.
As the discuess about all the device clocks being listed in
the power-domains itself.

There are several reasons as follows:

Firstly, the clocks need be turned off to save power when
the system enter the suspend state. So we need to enumerate
the clocks in the dts. In order to power domain can turn on and off.

Secondly, the reset-circuit should reset be synchronous on RK3288,
then sync revoked. So we need to enable clocks of all devices.
In other words, we have to enable the clocks before you operate them
if all the device clocks are included in someone domians.

Thirdly, as the chip designs for PM hardhare. we need turn on the noc
clocks, if we are operating the "pd_vio" domain to enter the idle status.
The device's clock be included in domains that needed turn on if do that.

The clocks in the dts are needed to enable before you want to happy work.
At the moment, This patch is very good work for PM hardware.

Also, we can add these clocks in the future if we have some hidden clocks.
