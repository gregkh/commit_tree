block: add an API for Persistent Reservations

This commits adds a driver API and ioctls for controlling Persistent
Reservations s/genericly/generically/ at the block layer.  Persistent
Reservations are supported by SCSI and NVMe and allow controlling who gets
access to a device in a shared storage setup.

Note that we add a pr_ops structure to struct block_device_operations
instead of adding the members directly to avoid bloating all instances
of devices that will never support Persistent Reservations.
