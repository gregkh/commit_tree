sched/core: Simplify INIT_PREEMPT_COUNT

As per the following commit:

  d86ee4809d03 ("sched: optimize cond_resched()")

we need PREEMPT_ACTIVE to avoid cond_resched() from working before
the scheduler is set up.

However, keeping preemption disabled should do the same thing
already, making the PREEMPT_ACTIVE part entirely redundant.

The only complication is !PREEMPT_COUNT kernels, where
PREEMPT_DISABLED ends up being 0. Instead we use an unconditional
PREEMPT_OFFSET to set preempt_count() even on !PREEMPT_COUNT
kernels.
