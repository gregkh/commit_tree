drm/i915: Don't call intel_get_hpd_pins() when there's no hotplug interrupt

On GMCH plaforms we are now getting the following spew on aux
interrupts:
[drm:intel_get_hpd_pins] hotplug event received, stat 0x00000000, dig 0x00000000, pins 0x00000000
[drm:intel_get_hpd_pins] hotplug event received, stat 0x00000000, dig 0x00000000, pins 0x00000000
[drm:intel_get_hpd_pins] hotplug event received, stat 0x00000000, dig 0x00000000, pins 0x00000000
[drm:intel_get_hpd_pins] hotplug event received, stat 0x00000000, dig 0x00000000, pins 0x00000000
[drm:intel_get_hpd_pins] hotplug event received, stat 0x00000000, dig 0x00000000, pins 0x00000000
[drm:intel_dp_aux_ch] dp_aux_ch timeout status 0x71450064

Prevent it by not calling intel_get_hpd_pins() unless one of the HPD
interrupt bits are actually set.

I already fixed similar annoyance once with
4bca26d0a6518d51a9abe64fbde4b12f04c74053 drm/i915: Use HOTPLUG_INT_STATUS_G4X on VLV/CHV

but another source for it got added in
fd63e2a972c670887e5e8a08440111d3812c0996 drm/i915: combine i9xx_get_hpd_pins and pch_get_hpd_pins

due to pch_get_hpd_pins() being chosen over i9xx_get_hpd_pins() to
serve as the new unified piece of code. pch_get_hpd_pins() had the debug
print, and i9xx_get_hpd_pins() didn't.
