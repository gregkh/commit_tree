KVM: Add kvm_arch_vcpu_{un}blocking callbacks

Some times it is useful for architecture implementations of KVM to know
when the VCPU thread is about to block or when it comes back from
blocking (arm/arm64 needs to know this to properly implement timers, for
example).

Therefore provide a generic architecture callback function in line with
what we do elsewhere for KVM generic-arch interactions.
