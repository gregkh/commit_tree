brcmfmac: introduce brcmf_net_detach() function

In case of error during brcmf_bus_start() the network interfaces were
freed using free_netdev(). However, the interfaces may have additional
memory allocated which is not freed. The netdev has destructor set to
brcmf_cfg80211_free_netdev() which frees the additional memory if
allocated and call free_netdev(). The brcmf_net_detach() either calls
brcmf_cfg80211_free_netdev() directly or uses unregister_netdev() when
struct net_device::reg_state indicates the netdev was registered.
