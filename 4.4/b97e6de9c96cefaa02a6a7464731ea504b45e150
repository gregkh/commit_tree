KVM: x86: merge kvm_arch_set_irq with kvm_set_msi_inatomic

We do not want to do too much work in atomic context, in particular
not walking all the VCPUs of the virtual machine.  So we want
to distinguish the architecture-specific injection function for irqfd
from kvm_set_msi.  Since it's still empty, reuse the newly added
kvm_arch_set_irq and rename it to kvm_arch_set_irq_inatomic.
