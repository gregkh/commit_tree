iwlwifi: mvm: rs: fix success ratio comparison in rs_get_best_rate

success_ratio is actually 128 * SR in percentage while
IWL_MVM_RS_SR_NO_DECREASE is 85%. Fix this by using RS_PERCENT().
This bug caused the if branch to be always executed. This in turn
led to always selecting a rate, following a column switch, in which
the expected throughput would exceed the best expected current throughput.
In some scenarios where the success ratio isn't >85% such a rate
could be too aggressive leading us to avoid the new column.
This has the potential of causing sub optimal performance.
