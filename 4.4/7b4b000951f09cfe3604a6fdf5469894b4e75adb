RDS: fix rds-ping deadlock over TCP transport

Sowmini found hang with rds-ping while testing RDS over TCP. Its
a corner case and doesn't happen always. The issue is not reproducible
with IB transport. Its clear from below dump why we see it with RDS TCP.

 [<ffffffff81553627>] tcp_v4_rcv+0x867/0x880
 [<ffffffff8152e0b3>] ip_local_deliver_finish+0xa3/0x220

This happens because rds_send_xmit() chain wants to take
sock_lock which is already taken by tcp_v4_rcv() on its
way to rds_tcp_data_ready(). Commit db6526dcb51b ("RDS: use
rds_send_xmit() state instead of RDS_LL_SEND_FULL") which
was trying to opportunistically finish the send request
in same thread context.

But because of above recursive lock hang with RDS TCP,
the send work from rds_send_pong() needs to deferred to
worker to avoid lock up. Given RDS ping is more of connectivity
test than performance critical path, its should be ok even
for transport like IB.
