ext4 crypto: ext4_page_crypto() doesn't need a encryption context

Since ext4_page_crypto() doesn't need an encryption context (at least
not any more), this allows us to simplify a number function signature
and also allows us to avoid needing to allocate a context in
ext4_block_write_begin().  It also means we no longer need a separate
ext4_decrypt_one() function.
