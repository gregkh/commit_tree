ide: pdc202xx_new: Replace timeval with ktime_t

This driver uses 'struct timeval' which we are trying to remove since
32 bit time types will break in the year 2038 by replacing it with
ktime_t.

This patch changes do_gettimeofday() to ktime_get() because
ktime_get() returns a ktime_t while do_gettimeofday() returns struct
timeval.

This patch also uses ktime_us_delta() to get the elapsed time.
