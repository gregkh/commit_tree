slab/slub: adjust kmem_cache_alloc_bulk API

Adjust kmem_cache_alloc_bulk API before we have any real users.

Adjust API to return type 'int' instead of previously type 'bool'.  This
is done to allow future extension of the bulk alloc API.

A future extension could be to allow SLUB to stop at a page boundary, when
specified by a flag, and then return the number of objects.

The advantage of this approach, would make it easier to make bulk alloc
run without local IRQs disabled.  With an approach of cmpxchg "stealing"
the entire c->freelist or page->freelist.  To avoid overshooting we would
stop processing at a slab-page boundary.  Else we always end up returning
some objects at the cost of another cmpxchg.

To keep compatible with future users of this API linking against an older
kernel when using the new flag, we need to return the number of allocated
objects with this API change.
