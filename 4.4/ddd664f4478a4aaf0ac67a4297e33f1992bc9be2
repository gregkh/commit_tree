btrfs: reada: Fix returned errno code

reada is using -1 instead of the -ENOMEM defined macro to specify that
a buffer allocation failed. Since the error number is propagated, the
caller will get a -EPERM which is the wrong error condition.

Also, updating the caller to return the exact value from
reada_add_block.

Smatch tool warning:
reada_add_block() warn: returning -1 instead of -ENOMEM is sloppy
