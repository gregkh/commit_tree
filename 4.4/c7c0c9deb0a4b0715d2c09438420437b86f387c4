s390/dasd: fix double free in dasd_eckd_read_conf

The configuration data is stored per path and also the first valid
configuration data per device. When dasd_eckd_read_conf is called
again after a path got lost the device configuration data is cleared
but possibly not the per path configuration data. This might lead to a
double free when the lost path gets operational again.

Fix by clearing all per path configuration data when the first valid
configuration data is received and stored.
