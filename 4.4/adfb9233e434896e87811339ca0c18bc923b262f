serial: omap: remove warnings about unused functions

They're used by only if CONFIG_PM is enabled, so enclose them
with proper ifdefs. Removes these warnings:

drivers/tty/serial/omap-serial.c:202:12: warning: 'serial_omap_get_context_loss_count' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
drivers/tty/serial/omap-serial.c:213:13: warning: 'serial_omap_enable_wakeup' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
