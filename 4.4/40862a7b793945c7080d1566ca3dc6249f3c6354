perf report: Amend documentation about max_stack and synthesized callchains

The --max_stack option was added as an optimization to reduce processing time,
so people specifying --max-stack might get a increased processing time if
combined with synthesized callchains, but otherwise no real harm.

A warning about setting both --max_stack and the synthesized callchains max
depth seems like overkill.  Amend the documentation.
