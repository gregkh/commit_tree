mac80211: move beacon_loss_count into ifmgd

There's little point in keeping (and even sending to userspace)
the beacon_loss_count value per station, since it can only apply
to the AP on a managed-mode connection. Move the value to ifmgd,
advertise it only in managed mode, and remove it from ethtool as
it's available through better interfaces.
