Revert "x86/efi: Request desired alignment via the PE/COFF headers"

This reverts commit:

  aeffc4928ea2 ("x86/efi: Request desired alignment via the PE/COFF headers")

Linn reports that Signtool complains that kernels built with
CONFIG_EFI_STUB=y are violating the PE/COFF specification because
the 'SizeOfImage' field is not a multiple of 'SectionAlignment'.

This violation was introduced as an optimisation to skip having
the kernel relocate itself during boot and instead have the
firmware place it at a correctly aligned address.

No one else has complained and I'm not aware of any firmware
implementations that refuse to boot with commit aeffc4928ea2,
but it's a real bug, so revert the offending commit.
