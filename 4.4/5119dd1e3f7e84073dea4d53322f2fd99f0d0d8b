usb: renesas_usbhs: Add support for R-Car H3

This patch adds a compatible string to support for R-Car H3.

Since the HS-USB controller of R-Car H3 is almost the same specification
with R-Car Gen2 (these have 16 pipes and usb-dmac), this patch
sets the "type" of renesas_usbhs_driver_param to USBHS_TYPE_RCAR_GEN2.
