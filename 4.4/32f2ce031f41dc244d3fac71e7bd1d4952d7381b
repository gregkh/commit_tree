serial: sh-sci: Stop acknowledging DMA transmit completions

As dmaengine_prep_slave_sg() is called with the DMA_CTRL_ACK flag set
for DMA transmit requests, there's no need to explicitly acknowledge DMA
transmit requests in the DMA transmit completion callback.

Hence remove the call to async_tx_ack(), and remove the now unused
dma_async_tx_descriptor pointer in the sci_port structure.
