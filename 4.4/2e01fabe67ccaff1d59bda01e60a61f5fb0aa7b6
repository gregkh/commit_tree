signals: kill block_all_signals() and unblock_all_signals()

It is hardly possible to enumerate all problems with block_all_signals()
and unblock_all_signals().  Just for example,

1. block_all_signals(SIGSTOP/etc) simply can't help if the caller is
   multithreaded. Another thread can dequeue the signal and force the
   group stop.

2. Even is the caller is single-threaded, it will "stop" anyway. It
   will not sleep, but it will spin in kernel space until SIGCONT or
   SIGKILL.

And a lot more. In short, this interface doesn't work at all, at least
the last 10+ years.

  Yeah the only times I played around with the DRM_LOCK stuff was when
  old drivers accidentally deadlocked - my impression is that the entire
  DRM_LOCK thing was never really tested properly ;-) Hence I'm all for
  purging where this leaks out of the drm subsystem.
