i40e/i40evf: change dynamic interrupt thresholds

The dynamic algorithm, while now working, doesn't have good
performance in 40G mode.

One part of this patch addresses the high CPU utilization of some small
streaming workloads that the driver should reduce CPU in.

It also changes the minimum ITR that the dynamic algorithm
will settle on, causing our minimum latency to go from 12us
to about 14us, when using adaptive mode.

It also changes the BULK interrupt rate to allow maximum throughput
on a 40Gb connection with a single thread of transmit, clamping
interrupt rate to 8000 for TX makes single thread traffic go too
slow.

The new ULTRA bulk setting is introduced and is used
when the Rx packet rate on this queue exceeds 40000 packets per
second.  This value of 40000 was chosen because the automatic tuning
of minimum ITR=20us means that a single queue can't quite achieve
that many packets per second from a round-robin test.
