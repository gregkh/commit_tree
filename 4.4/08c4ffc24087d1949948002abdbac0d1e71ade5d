usb: dwc2: host: reset frame number after suspend

Frame number is reset in hardware after exiting hibernation.
Thus, reset frame_number and ensure qh are queued with correct
sched_frame.

Otherwise, qh->sched_frame may be too high compared to
current frame number (which is 0). This can delay addition of qh in
the list of transfers until frame number reaches qh->sched_frame.
