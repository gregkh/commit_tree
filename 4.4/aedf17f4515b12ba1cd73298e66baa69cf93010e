lightnvm: change max_phys_sect to uint

The max_phys_sect variable is defined as a char. We do a boundary check
to maximally allow 256 physical page descriptors per command. As we are
not indexing from zero. This expression is always false. Bump the
max_phys_sect to an unsigned int to support the range check.
