arm: enable building of all dtbs

Enable building all dtb files when CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS is enabled. The dtbs
are not really dependent on a platform being enabled or any other kernel
config, so for testing coverage it is convenient to build all of the dtbs.
This builds all dts files in the tree, not just targets listed. This
is simpler for arm64 which has a bunch of sub-dirs.
