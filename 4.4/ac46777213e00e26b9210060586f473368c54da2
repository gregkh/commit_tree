btrfs: extent_io: Introduce needed structure for recoding set/clear bits

Add a new structure, extent_change_set, to record how many bytes are
changed in one set/clear_extent_bits() operation, with detailed changed
ranges info.

This provides the needed facilities for later qgroup reserve framework.
