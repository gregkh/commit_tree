f2fs: fix incorrect return statement in the function f2fs_ioc_release_volatile_write

This fixes the incorrect return statement at the end of the function
f2fs_ioc_release_volatile_write's body for returning zero as this is
incorrect due to the function call before this return statement to
the function punch_hole being able to fail and we should return this
function's return fail directly in order to signal to callers of the
function f2fs_ioc_release_volatile if a failure arises with this call
to punch_hole fails.
