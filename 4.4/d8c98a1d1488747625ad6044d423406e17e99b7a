x86/paravirt: Prevent rtc_cmos platform device init on PV guests

Adding the rtc platform device in non-privileged Xen PV guests causes
an IRQ conflict because these guests do not have legacy PIC and may
allocate irqs in the legacy range.

In a single VCPU Xen PV guest we should have:

/proc/interrupts:
           CPU0
  0:       4934  xen-percpu-virq      timer0
  1:          0  xen-percpu-ipi       spinlock0
  2:          0  xen-percpu-ipi       resched0
  3:          0  xen-percpu-ipi       callfunc0
  4:          0  xen-percpu-virq      debug0
  5:          0  xen-percpu-ipi       callfuncsingle0
  6:          0  xen-percpu-ipi       irqwork0
  7:        321   xen-dyn-event     xenbus
  8:         90   xen-dyn-event     hvc_console
  ...

But hvc_console cannot get its interrupt because it is already in use
by rtc0 and the console does not work.

  genirq: Flags mismatch irq 8. 00000000 (hvc_console) vs. 00000000 (rtc0)

We can avoid this problem by realizing that unprivileged PV guests (both
Xen and lguests) are not supposed to have rtc_cmos device and so
adding it is not necessary.

Privileged guests (i.e. Xen's dom0) do use it but they should not have
irq conflicts since they allocate irqs above legacy range (above
gsi_top, in fact).

Instead of explicitly testing whether the guest is privileged we can
extend pv_info structure to include information about guest's RTC
support.
