drm/i915: Fix module initialisation, v2.

The driver doesn't support UMS any more, so set DRIVER_MODESET by default,
remove the legacy s/r callbacks, and rename the s/r functions to make it more clear
they're only in use by switcheroo now.

Also remove an obsolete comment about atomic. Normal updates are supported only
async updates aren't yet.

v2: Don't unconditionally set DRIVER_ATOMIC, we're not yet there.
