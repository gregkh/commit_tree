[media] go7007: Fix returned errno code in gen_mjpeghdr_to_package()

The driver is using -1 instead of the -ENOMEM defined macro to specify
that a buffer allocation failed. Since the error number is propagated,
the caller will get a -EPERM which is the wrong error condition.

Also, the smatch tool complains with the following warning:

gen_mjpeghdr_to_package() warn: returning -1 instead of -ENOMEM is sloppy
