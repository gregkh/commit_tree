staging: most: fix Makefile

The Makefile is including "drivers/media/video". But there is no such
directory in kernel tree. Since it is aim-v4l2 this might have been
"drivers/media/v4l2-core", but the Kconfig already mentions that it
depends on VIDEO_V4L2. So no need to mention that again in the Makefile.
