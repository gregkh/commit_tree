kernel-docs.txt: update kernelnewbies reference

The #kernelnewbies irc channel is no longer hosted on
irc.openprojects.net but on irc.oftc.net.
Removed pointer to different regional servers since oftc already uses
geo-IP load balancing.

The "description" quoted from the website no longer exists,
therefore removed the reference, quotes and carets.

The paragraph also contains a pointer to the kernelnewbies.org website.
Therefore changing the title to:
"Kernel Newbies IRC Channel and Website."
