irqchip/gic-v2m: Add workaround for APM X-Gene GICv2m erratum

APM X-Gene GICv2m implementation has an erratum where the
MSI data needs to be the offset from the spi_start in order to
trigger the correct MSI interrupt. This is different from the
standard GICv2m implementation where the MSI data is the absolute
value within the range from spi_start to (spi_start + num_spis)
of each v2m frame.

This patch reads MSI_IIDR register (present in all GICv2m
implementations) to identify X-Gene GICv2m implementation and
apply workaround to change the data portion of MSI vector.
