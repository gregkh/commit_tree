USB: add quirk for devices with broken LPM

Some USB device / host controller combinations seem to have problems
with Link Power Management.  For example, Steinar found that his xHCI
controller wouldn't handle bandwidth calculations correctly for two
video cards simultaneously when LPM was enabled, even though the bus
had plenty of bandwidth available.

This patch introduces a new quirk flag for devices that should remain
disabled for LPM, and creates quirk entries for Steinar's devices.
