Bluetooth: close HCI device when user channel socket gets closed

With 9380f9eacfbbee701daa416edd6625efcd3e29e1 the order of unsetting
the HCI_USER_CHANNEL flag of the HCI device was reverted to ensure
the device is first closed before making it available again.

Due to hci_dev_close checking for HCI_USER_CHANNEL being set on the
device it was never really closed and was kept opened. We're now
calling hci_dev_do_close directly to make sure the device is correctly
closed and we keep the correct order to unset the flag on our device
object.
