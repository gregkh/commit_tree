ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Add set_tdm_slots() support

Implements set_tdm_slot() callback for mcasp. Channel constraints are
updated according to the configured tdm mask and slots each time
set_tdm_slot() is called. The special case when slot width is set to
zero is allowed and it means that slot width is the same as the sample
width.
