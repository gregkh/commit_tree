serial: sh-sci: Replace buggy big #ifdef by runtime logic

The #ifdef logic to clear SCxSR bits using RMW on SCIFA/SCIFB and SCIF
variants with some SCIFA features (sh7705/SH7720/sh7721) has several
drawbacks:
  - It wasn't updated for newer R-Mobile variants (APE6),
  - It doesn't correctly handle SoCs with both SCIF and SCIFA/B (e.g.
    R-Car Gen2, but also legacy sh7723/sh7724),
  - It doesn't play well with ARM multi-platform kernels: on R-Car Gen2,
    SCIF/SCIFA/SCIFB/HSCIF were handled differently, depending on
    whether r8a7740 or sh73a0 support was enabled or not,

Replace the #ifdef logic by runtime logic to fix this.

SCIFA/SCIFB and SCIF on sh7705/sh7720/sh7721 use RMW to clear error
bits, other variants use plain stores, as before.

Note that this changes behavior for SCIFA on sh7723/sh7724 (these SoCs
have both SCIF and SCIFA), which didn't use RMW before.
