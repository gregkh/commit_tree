staging/rdma/hfi1: Fix regression in send performance

The clear_ahg call is new in hfi1 vs qib.  For small messages the progress
routine always builds one and clears out the ahg state when the queue has gone
to empty which is the predominant case for small messages.

Inline the routine and avoid the call to sdma_ahg_free to mitigate the
performance impact.  Finally, move the routine to qp.h for scope reasons.
