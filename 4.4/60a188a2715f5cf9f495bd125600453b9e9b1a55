mwifiex: remove USB8897 chipset support

We don't have any customer using this chipset via USB
interface. if both mwifiex_pcie and mwifiex_usb modules
are enabled by user, sometimes mwifiex_usb wins the race
even if user wants wlan interface to be on PCIe and
USB for bluetooth. This patch solves the problem.
