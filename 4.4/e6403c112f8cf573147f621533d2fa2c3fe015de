serial: sh-sci: Don't call sci_rx_interrupt() on error when using DMA

The error handler calls sci_rx_interrupt() to drain the receive FIFO if
an error condition happens.

However, if DMA is enabled on SCIFA or SCIFB, this will call
disable_irq_nosync() twice. Due to this imbalance, the receive interrupt
will never be re-enabled, and reception stops forever.

To fix this, restrict draining the FIFO to PIO mode, and just call
sci_receive_chars() directly.
