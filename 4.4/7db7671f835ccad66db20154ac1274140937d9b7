mm: page migration trylock newpage at same level as oldpage

Clean up page migration a little by moving the trylock of newpage from
move_to_new_page() into __unmap_and_move(), where the old page has been
locked.  Adjust unmap_and_move_huge_page() and balloon_page_migrate()
accordingly.

But make one kind-of-functional change on the way: whereas trylock of
newpage used to BUG() if it failed, now simply return -EAGAIN if so.
Cutting out BUG()s is good, right?  But, to be honest, this is really to
extend the usefulness of the custom put_new_page feature, allowing a pool
of new pages to be shared perhaps with racing uses.

Use an "else" instead of that "skip_unmap" label.
