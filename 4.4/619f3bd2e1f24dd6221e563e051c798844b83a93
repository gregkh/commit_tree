ravb: Document binding for r8a7795 SoC

This patch updates the ravb binding to support the r8a7795 SoC by:
- Adding a compat string for the new hardware
- Adding 25 named interrupts to binding for the new SoC;
  older SoCs continue to use a single multiplexed interrupt

The example is also updated to reflect the r8a7795 as this is the
more complex case.

Based on work by Kazuya Mizuguchi and others.
