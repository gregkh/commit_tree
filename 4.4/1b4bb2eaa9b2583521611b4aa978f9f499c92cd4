vfio/platform: store mapped memory in region, instead of an on-stack copy

vfio_platform_{read,write}_mmio() call ioremap_nocache() to map
a region of io memory, which they store in struct vfio_platform_region to
be eventually re-used, or unmapped by vfio_platform_regions_cleanup().

These functions receive a copy of their struct vfio_platform_region
argument on the stack - so these mapped areas are always allocated, and
always leaked.

Pass this argument as a pointer instead.
