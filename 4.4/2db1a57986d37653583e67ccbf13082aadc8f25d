ALSA: pci: depend on ZONE_DMA

There are several sound drivers that 'select ZONE_DMA'.  This is
backwards as ZONE_DMA is an architecture capability exported to drivers.
Switch the polarity of the dependency to disable these drivers when the
architecture does not support ZONE_DMA.  This was discovered in the
context of testing/enabling devm_memremap_pages() which depends on
ZONE_DEVICE.  ZONE_DEVICE in turn depends on !ZONE_DMA.
