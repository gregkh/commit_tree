drm/atomic-helper: Pimp docs with recommendations for rpm drivers

Requested by Laurent.

Note that this uses the new markdown support which will only land in
kernel 4.4 (for the code snippet).

v2: A few spelling fixes I spotted myself.

v3: Big reword for commit_planes() kerneldoc based on a text from
Laurent.
