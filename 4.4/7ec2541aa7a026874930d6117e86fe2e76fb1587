r8152: add reset_resume function

When the reset_resume() is called, the flag of SELECTIVE_SUSPEND should be
cleared and reinitialize the device, whether the SELECTIVE_SUSPEND is set
or not. If reset_resume() is called, it means the power supply is cut or the
device is reset. That is, the device wouldn't be in runtime suspend state and
the reinitialization is necessary.
