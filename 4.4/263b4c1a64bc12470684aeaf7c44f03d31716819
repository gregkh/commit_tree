ACPI / property: Expose data-only subnodes via sysfs

Add infrastructure needed to expose data-only subnodes of ACPI
device objects introduced previously via sysfs.

Each data-only subnode is represented as a sysfs directory under
the directory corresponding to its parent object (a device or a
data-only subnode).  Each of them has a "path" attribute (containing
the full ACPI namespace path to the object the subnode data come from)
at this time.
