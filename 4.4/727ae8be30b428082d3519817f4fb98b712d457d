x86/PCI/ACPI: Fix regression caused by commit 4d6b4e69a245

Commit 4d6b4e69a245 ("x86/PCI/ACPI: Use common interface to support
PCI host bridge") converted x86 to use the common interface
acpi_pci_root_create, but the conversion missed on code piece in
arch/x86/pci/bus_numa.c, which causes regression on some legacy
AMD platforms as reported by Arthur Marsh <arthur.marsh@internode.on.net>.
The root causes is that acpi_pci_root_create() fails to insert
host bridge resources into iomem_resource/ioport_resource because
x86_pci_root_bus_resources() has already inserted those resources.
So change x86_pci_root_bus_resources() to not insert resources into
iomem_resource/ioport_resource.
