params: don't ignore the rest of cmdline if parse_one() fails

parse_args() just aborts after it hits an error, so other args
at the same initcall level are simply ignored. This can lead to
other hard-to-understand problems, for example my testing machine
panics during the boot if I pass "locktorture.verbose=true".

Change parse_args() to save the err code for return and continue.
