i40e/i40evf: Add module_types and update_link_info

Add a module_types variable to the link_info struct to save the module
information from get_phy_capabilities. This information can be used to
determine which speeds the module supports.

Also add a new function update_link_info which updates the module_types
parameter and then calls get_link_info. This function should be called
in place of get_link_info so that the module_types variable stays
up-to-date with the rest of the link information.

The EAS table does not reflect the values that are actually returned,
so instead, basing these values on the Ethernet compliance codes
specified in table 33 of SFF-8436 as these have been accurate.

Use the new variable in ethtool to differentiate between a 10G/1G dual
speed fiber module and a 10G only module.
