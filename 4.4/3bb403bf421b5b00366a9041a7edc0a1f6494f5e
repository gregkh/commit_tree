drm: Stop using linedur_ns and pixeldur_ns for vblank timestamps

linedur_ns, and especially pixeldur_ns are becoming rather inaccurate
to be used for the vblank timestamp correction. With 4k@60 the pixel
duration is already below 2ns, so the amount of error due to the
truncation to nanoseconds is introducing quite a bit of error.

We can avoid such problems if we instead calculate the timestamp
delta_ns directly from the dislay timings, avoiding the use of
these intermediate truncated values.
