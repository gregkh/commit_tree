arm64: KVM: Add workaround for Cortex-A57 erratum 834220

Cortex-A57 parts up to r1p2 can misreport Stage 2 translation faults
when a Stage 1 permission fault or device alignment fault should
have been reported.

This patch implements the workaround (which is to validate that the
Stage-1 translation actually succeeds) by using code patching.
