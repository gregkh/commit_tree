efi, x86: Rearrange efi_mem_attributes()

x86 and ia64 implement efi_mem_attributes() differently. This
function needs to be available for other architectures
(such as arm64) as well, such as for the purpose of ACPI/APEI.

ia64 EFI does not set up a 'memmap' variable and does not set
the EFI_MEMMAP flag, so it needs to have its unique implementation
of efi_mem_attributes().

Move efi_mem_attributes() implementation from x86 to the core
EFI code, and declare it with __weak.

It is recommended that other architectures should not override
the default implementation.
