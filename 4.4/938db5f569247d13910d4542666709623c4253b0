tracing: Remove unused tracing option "ftrace_preempt"

There was a time where the function tracing would disable interrupts unless
specifically told not to, where it would only disable preemption. With the
new lockless code, the function tracing never disalbes interrupts and just
uses disabling of preemption. Remove the option "ftrace_preempt" as it does
nothing anyway.
