KVM: VMX: Fix commit which broke PML

I found PML was broken since below commit:

	KVM: VMX: unify SECONDARY_VM_EXEC_CONTROL update

	Unify the update in vmx_cpuid_update()

The reason is in above commit vmx_cpuid_update calls vmx_secondary_exec_control,
in which currently SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_PML bit is cleared unconditionally (as
PML is enabled in creating vcpu). Therefore if vcpu_cpuid_update is called after
vcpu is created, PML will be disabled unexpectedly while log-dirty code still
thinks PML is used.

Fix this by clearing SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_PML in vmx_secondary_exec_control
only when PML is not supported or not enabled (!enable_pml). This is more
reasonable as PML is currently either always enabled or disabled. With this
explicit updating SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_PML in vmx_enable{disable}_pml is not
needed so also rename vmx_enable{disable}_pml to vmx_create{destroy}_pml_buffer.
