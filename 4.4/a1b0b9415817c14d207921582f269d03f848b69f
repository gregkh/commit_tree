NFC: nci: Create pipe on specific gate in nci_hci_connect_gate

Some gates might need to have their pipes explicitly created.
Add a call to nci_hci_create_pipe in nci_hci_connect_gate for
every gate that is different than NCI_HCI_LINK_MGMT_GATE or
NCI_HCI_ADMIN_GATE.

In case of an error when opening a pipe, like in hci layer,
delete the pipe if it was created.
