KVM: x86: set KVM_REQ_EVENT on local interrupt request from user space

Set KVM_REQ_EVENT when a PIC in user space injects a local interrupt.

Currently a request is only made when neither the PIC nor the APIC is in
the kernel, which is not sufficient in the split IRQ chip case.

This addresses a problem in QEMU where interrupts are delayed until
another path invokes the event loop.
