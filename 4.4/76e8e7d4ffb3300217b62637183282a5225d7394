staging: comedi: make some variables unsigned in comedi_read()

In `comedi_read()`, the `n` and `m` variables are of type `int`.  Change
them to `unsigned int` as they are used to measure a positive number of
bytes.  The `count` variable is also of type `int` and holds the
returned number of bytes.  Change it to type `ssize_t` to match the
function's return type.
