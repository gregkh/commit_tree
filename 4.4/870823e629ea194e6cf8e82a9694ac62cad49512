configfs: add show and store methods to struct configfs_attribute

Add methods to struct configfs_attribute to directly show and store
attributes without adding boilerplate code to every user.  In addition
to the methods this also adds 3 helper macros to define read/write,
read-only and write-only attributes with a single line of code.
