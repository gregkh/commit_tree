cxlflash: Fix data corruption when vLUN used over multiple cards

If the same virtual LUN is accessed over multiple cards, only accesses
made over the first card will be valid. Accesses made over the second
card will go to the wrong LUN causing data corruption.

This is because the global LUN's mode word was being used to determine
whether the LUN table for that card needs to be programmed. The mode
word would be setup by the first card, causing the LUN table for the
second card to not be programmed.

By unconditionally initializing the LUN table (not depending on the
mode word), the problem is avoided.
