vhost: relax log address alignment

commit 5d9a07b0de512b77bf28d2401e5fe3351f00a240 ("vhost: relax used
address alignment") fixed the alignment for the used virtual address,
but not for the physical address used for logging.

That's a mistake: alignment should clearly be the same for virtual and
physical addresses,
