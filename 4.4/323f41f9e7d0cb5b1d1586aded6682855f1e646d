ARC: dw2 unwind: Ignore CIE version !=1 gracefully instead of bailing

ARC dwarf unwinder only supports CIE version == 1
The boot time dwarf sanitizer (part of binary lookup table constructor)
would simply bail if it saw CIE version == 3, rendering unwinder with a
NULL lookup table.

It seems libgcc linked with kernel does have such entries.

With fallback linear search removed, and a NULL binary lookup table,
unwinder fails to generate any stack trace.

So allow graceful ignoring of unsupported CIE entries.

This problem was initially seen in Alexey's setup (and not mine) as he
was using buildroot built toolchain (libgcc) which doesn't get built with
CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET="-gdwarf-2 which is my default

Fixes STAR 9000985048: "kernel unwinder broken with stock tools"
