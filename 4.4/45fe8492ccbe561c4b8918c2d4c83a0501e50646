f2fs: fix to correct freed section number during gc

This patch fixes to maintain the right section count freed in garbage
collecting when triggering a foreground gc.

Besides, when a foreground gc is running on current selected section, once
we fail to gc one segment, it's better to abandon gcing the left segments
in current section, because anyway we will select next victim for
foreground gc, so gc on the left segments in previous section will become
overhead and also cause the long latency for caller.
