hwmon: (abx500) drop the use of IRQF_NO_SUSPEND

The description in the driver states: "ABX500 does not provide auto ADC,
so to monitor the required temperatures, a periodic work is used. It is
more important to not wake up the CPU... If the chip gets too hot during
a sleep state it's most likely due to external factors, such as the
surrounding temperature and nothing can be done in S/W."

So it makes no sense to keep IRQs enabled as it need not be wakeup
source. This patch removes the use of IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag
