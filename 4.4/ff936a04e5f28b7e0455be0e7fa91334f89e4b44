bpf: fix cb access in socket filter programs

eBPF socket filter programs may see junk in 'u32 cb[5]' area,
since it could have been used by protocol layers earlier.

For socket filter programs used in af_packet we need to clean
20 bytes of skb->cb area if it could be used by the program.
For programs attached to TCP/UDP sockets we need to save/restore
these 20 bytes, since it's used by protocol layers.

Remove SK_RUN_FILTER macro, since it's no longer used.

Long term we may move this bpf cb area to per-cpu scratch, but that
requires addition of new 'per-cpu load/store' instructions,
so not suitable as a short term fix.
