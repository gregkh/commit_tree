dm: refactor ioctl handling

This moves the call to blkdev_ioctl and the argument checking to DM core
code, and only leaves a callout to find the block device to operate on
in the targets.  This simplifies the code and allows us to pass through
ioctl-like command using other methods in the next patch.

Also split out a helper around calling the prepare_ioctl method that
will be reused for persistent reservation handling.
