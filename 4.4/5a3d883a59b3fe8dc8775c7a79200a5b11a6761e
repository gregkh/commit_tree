KVM: s390: switch to get_tod_clock() and fix STP sync races

Nobody except early.c makes use of store_tod_clock() to handle the
cc. So if we would get a cc != 0, we would be in more trouble.

Let's replace all users with get_tod_clock(). Returning a cc
on an ioctl sounded strange either way.

We can now also easily move the get_tod_clock() call into the
preempt_disable() section. This is in fact necessary to make the
STP sync work as expected. Otherwise the host TOD could change
and we would end up with a wrong epoch calculation.
