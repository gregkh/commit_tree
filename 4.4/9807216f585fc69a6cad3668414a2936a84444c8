drm/i915: Skip fence installation for objects with rotated views (v4)

While pinning a fb object to the display plane, only install a fence
if the object is using a normal view. This corresponds with the
behavior found in i915_gem_object_do_pin() where the fencability
criteria is determined only for objects with normal views.

v2:
Look at the object's map_and_fenceable flag to determine whether to
install a fence or not (Chris).

v3:
Pin and unpin a fence only if the current view type is normal.

v4:
Extend the "view type is normal" check for pin_fence as well.
