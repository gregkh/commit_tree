i40e: Additional checks for CEE APP priority validity

The firmware has added additional status information to allow software
to determine if the APP priority for FCoE/iSCSI/FIP is valid or not in
CEE DCBX mode.

This patch adds to support those additional checks and will only add
applications to the software table that have oper and sync bits set
without any error.
