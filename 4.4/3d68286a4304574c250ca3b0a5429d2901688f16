s390/nmi: remove pointless error strings

s390_handle_damage() has character string parameter which was used as
a pointer to verbose error message. The hope was (a lot of years ago)
when analyzing dumps that register R2 would still contain the pointer
and therefore it would be rather easy to tell what went wrong.

However gcc optimizes the strings away since a long time. And even if
it wouldn't it is necessary to have a close look at the machine check
interruption code to tell what's wrong.

So remove the pointless error strings.
