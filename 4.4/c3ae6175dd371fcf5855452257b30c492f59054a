misc: mic: SCIF RMA header file

This patch adds the internal data structures required to perform SCIF
RMAs. The data structures required to maintain per SCIF endpoint, RMA
information are contained in scif_endpt_rma_info. scif_pinned_pages
describes a set of SCIF pinned pages maintained locally. The
scif_window is a data structure which contains all the fields required
to describe a SCIF registered window on self and remote nodes. It
contains an offset which is used as a key to perform SCIF DMAs and CPU
copies between self and remote registered windows.
