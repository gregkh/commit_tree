dm thin: fix regression in advertised discard limits

When establishing a thin device's discard limits we cannot rely on the
underlying thin-pool device's discard capabilities (which are inherited
from the thin-pool's underlying data device) given that DM thin devices
must provide discard support even when the thin-pool's underlying data
device doesn't support discards.

Users were exposed to this thin device discard limits regression if
their thin-pool's underlying data device does _not_ support discards.
This regression caused all upper-layers that called the
blkdev_issue_discard() interface to not be able to issue discards to
thin devices (because discard_granularity was 0).  This regression
wasn't caught earlier because the device-mapper-test-suite's extensive
'thin-provisioning' discard tests are only ever performed against
thin-pool's with data devices that support discards.

Fix is to have thin_io_hints() test the pool's 'discard_enabled' feature
rather than inferring whether or not a thin device's discard support
should be enabled by looking at the thin-pool's discard_granularity.
