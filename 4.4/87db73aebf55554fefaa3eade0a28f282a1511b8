efi: Add support for EFI_MEMORY_RO attribute introduced by UEFIv2.5

The UEFI spec v2.5 introduces a new memory attribute
EFI_MEMORY_RO, which is now the preferred attribute to convey
that the nature of the contents of such a region allows it to be
mapped read-only (i.e., it contains .text and .rodata only).

The specification of the existing EFI_MEMORY_WP attribute has been
updated to align more closely with its common use as a
cacheability attribute rather than a permission attribute.

Add the #define and add the attribute to the memory map dumping
routine.
