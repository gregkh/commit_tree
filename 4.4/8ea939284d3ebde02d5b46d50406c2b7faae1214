staging: comedi: avoid bad truncation of a size_t in comedi_read()

At one point in `comedi_read()`, the variable `n` gets assigned to the
minimum of the parameter `nbytes` and the amount of readable buffer
space `m`.  The way that is done currently is unsafe in the unlikely
case that `nbytes` exceeds `UINT_MAX`, so fix it.
