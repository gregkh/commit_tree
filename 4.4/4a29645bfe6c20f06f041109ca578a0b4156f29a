net: bcmgenet: Implement RX coalescing control knobs

Add support for the ethtool rx-frames coalescing parameter which allows
defining the number of RX interrupts per frames received. The RDMA
engine supports a configurable timeout with a resolution of
approximately 8.192 us.

We can no longer enable the BDONE/PDONE interrupts as those would
fire for each packet/buffer received, which would defeat the MBDONE
interrupt purpose. The MBDONE interrupt is guaranteed to correspond to a
PDONE/BDONE interrupt when the threshold is set to 1.
