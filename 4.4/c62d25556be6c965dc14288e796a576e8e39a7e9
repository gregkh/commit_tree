mm, fs: introduce mapping_gfp_constraint()

There are many places which use mapping_gfp_mask to restrict a more
generic gfp mask which would be used for allocations which are not
directly related to the page cache but they are performed in the same
context.

Let's introduce a helper function which makes the restriction explicit and
easier to track.  This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
