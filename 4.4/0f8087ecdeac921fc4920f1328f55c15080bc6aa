block: Consolidate static integrity profile properties

We previously made a complete copy of a device's data integrity profile
even though several of the fields inside the blk_integrity struct are
pointers to fixed template entries in t10-pi.c.

Split the static and per-device portions so that we can reference the
template directly.
