spi: bitbang: Replace spinlock by mutex

chipselect (in the case of spi-gpio: spi_gpio_chipselect, which
calls gpiod_set_raw_value_cansleep) can sleep, so we should not
hold a spinlock while calling it from spi_bitbang_setup.

This issue was introduced by this commit, which converted spi-gpio
to cansleep variants:
d9dda5a191 "spi: spi-gpio: Use 'cansleep' variants to access GPIO"

Replacing the lock variable by a mutex fixes the issue: This is
safe as all instances where the lock is used are called from
contexts that can sleep.

Finally, update spi-ppc4xx and and spi-s3c24xx to use mutex
functions, as they directly hold the lock for similar purpose.
