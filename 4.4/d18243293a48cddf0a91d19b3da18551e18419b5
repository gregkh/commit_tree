misc: mic: SCIF RMA nodeqp and minor miscellaneous changes

This patch adds the SCIF kernel node QP control messages required to
enable SCIF RMAs. Examples of such node QP control messages include
registration, unregistration, remote memory allocation requests,
remote memory unmap and SCIF remote fence requests.

The patch also updates the SCIF driver with minor changes required to
enable SCIF RMAs by adding the new files to the build, initializing
RMA specific information during SCIF endpoint creation, reserving SCIF
DMA channels, initializing SCIF RMA specific global data structures,
adding the IOCTL hooks required for SCIF RMAs and updating RMA
specific debugfs hooks.
