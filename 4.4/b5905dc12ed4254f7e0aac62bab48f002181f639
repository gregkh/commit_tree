arm/arm64: KVM: Improve kvm_exit tracepoint

The ARM architecture only saves the exit class to the HSR (ESR_EL2 for
arm64) on synchronous exceptions, not on asynchronous exceptions like an
IRQ.  However, we only report the exception class on kvm_exit, which is
confusing because an IRQ looks like it exited at some PC with the same
reason as the previous exit.  Add a lookup table for the exception index
and prepend the kvm_exit tracepoint text with the exception type to
clarify this situation.

Also resolve the exception class (EC) to a human-friendly text version
so the trace output becomes immediately usable for debugging this code.
