staging: comedi: quatech_daqp_cs: use comedi_timeout() in ao (*insn_write)

The data link between the D/A data port and the D/A converter is a serial
link. The serial link requires about 8ms to complete a transfer. Use the
comedi_timeout() helper to ensure that there is not a previous transfer
still happening before trying to write new data to the channel.

For aesthetics, save the readback value after updating the hardware.
