HID: usbhid: Fix for the WiiU adapter from Mayflash

The WiiU adapter from Mayflash (see
http://www.mayflash.com/Products/NINTENDOWiiU/W009.html) is not
working correctly.

The "XInput" mode works fine, the controller is recognized as a xbox
controller. But it is only possible to connect one controller with this method.

In "DInput" mode the device is recognized as some kind of mouse input but no
joystick is created. This commit will change this behavior with
HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT to split the device into 4 input devices so that it will
also create joysticks in /dev/input/js*.
