tools lib bpf: Fix up FEATURE_{TESTS,DISPLAY} usage

When libbpf was introduced it wrongly asked for the "libelf" and "bpf"
feature tests to be performed (via FEATURE_TESTS), while asking that
"libbpf", "libelf-mmap", "libelf-getphdrnum" and "bpf" to have the
result of its respective tests to be displayed (via FEATURE_DISPLAY).

Due to another recently bug fixed in the tools/build/ infrastructure
("tools build: Fixup feature detection display function name") the
results for the entries in the FEATURE_DISPLAY, for this case, were
appearing as all succeeding, when two of them (the ones only on the
DISPLAY) were not even being performed.

Before:

  $ make -C tools/lib/bpf/
  make: Entering directory '/home/git/linux/tools/lib/bpf'
  Auto-detecting system features:
  ...                        libelf: [ on  ]
  ...             libelf-getphdrnum: [ OFF ]
  ...                   libelf-mmap: [ OFF ]
  ...                           bpf: [ on  ]
  <SNIP>

After, with FEATURE_TESTS == FEATURE_DISPLAY:

  Auto-detecting system features:
  ...                        libelf: [ on  ]
  ...             libelf-getphdrnum: [ on  ]
  ...                   libelf-mmap: [ on  ]
  ...                           bpf: [ on  ]
  <SNIP>

I just inverted, so that it tests the four features but displays just
the libelf and mmap ones, to make it more compact. So it becomes:

  $ make -C tools/lib/bpf/
  make: Entering directory '/home/git/linux/tools/lib/bpf'

  Auto-detecting system features:
  ...                        libelf: [ on  ]
  ...                           bpf: [ on  ]
