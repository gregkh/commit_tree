drm/exynos/gem: remove DMA-mapping hacks used for constructing page array

Exynos GEM objects contains an array of pointers to the pages, which the
allocated buffer consists of. Till now the code used some hacks (like
relying on DMA-mapping internal structures or using ARM-specific
dma_to_pfn helper) to build this array. This patch fixes this by adding
proper call to dma_get_sgtable_attrs() and using the acquired scatter-list
to construct needed array. This approach is more portable (work also for
ARM64) and finally fixes the layering violation that was present in this
code.
