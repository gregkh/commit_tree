mmc: mmc: extend the mmc_send_tuning()

The mmc_execute_tuning() has already prepared the opcode,
there is no need to prepare it again at mmc_send_tuning(),
and, there is a BUG of mmc_send_tuning() to determine the opcode
by bus width, assume eMMC was running at HS200, 4bit mode,
then the mmc_send_tuning() will overwrite the opcode from CMD21
to CMD19, then got error.

in addition, extend an argument of "cmd_error" to allow getting
if there was cmd error when tune response.
