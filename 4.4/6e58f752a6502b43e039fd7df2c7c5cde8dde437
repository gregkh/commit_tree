ACPI / EC: Fix broken 64bit big-endian users of 'global_lock'

global_lock is defined as an unsigned long and accessing only its lower
32 bits from sysfs is incorrect, as we need to consider other 32 bits
for big endian 64-bit systems. There are no such platforms yet, but the
code needs to be robust for such a case.

Fix that by changing type of 'global_lock' to u32.
