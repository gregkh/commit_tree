Bluetooth: l2cap_disconnection_req priority over shutdown

There is a L2CAP protocol race between the local peer and
the remote peer demanding disconnection of the L2CAP link.

When L2CAP ERTM is used, l2cap_sock_shutdown() can be called
from userland to disconnect L2CAP. However, there can be a
delay introduced by waiting for ACKs. During this waiting
period, the remote peer may have sent a Disconnection Request.
Therefore, recheck the shutdown status of the socket
after waiting for ACKs because there is no need to do
further processing if the connection has gone.
