nilfs2: do not call nilfs_mdt_bgl_lock() needlessly

In the bitmap based allocator implementation, nilfs_mdt_bgl_lock() helper
is frequently used to get a spinlock protecting a target block group.
This reduces its usage and simplifies arguments of some related functions
by directly passing a pointer to the spinlock.
