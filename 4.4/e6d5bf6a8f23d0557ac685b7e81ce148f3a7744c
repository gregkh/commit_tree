dmaengine: xgene-dma: Remove memcpy offload support due to performance drop

The DMA engine supports memory copy, RAID5 XOR, RAID6 PQ, and other
computations. But the bandwidth of the entire DMA engine is shared
among all channels. This patch re-configures operations availability
such that one can achieve maximum performance for XOR and PQ
computation by removing the memory offload operations.
