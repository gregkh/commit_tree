Revert "ipv4/icmp: redirect messages can use the ingress daddr as source"

Revert the commit e2ca690b657f ("ipv4/icmp: redirect messages
can use the ingress daddr as source"), which tried to introduce a more
suitable behaviour for ICMP redirect messages generated by VRRP routers.
However RFC 5798 section 8.1.1 states:

    The IPv4 source address of an ICMP redirect should be the address
    that the end-host used when making its next-hop routing decision.

while said commit used the generating packet destination
address, which do not match the above and in most cases leads to
no redirect packets to be generated.
