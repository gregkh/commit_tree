staging: fsl-mc: fsl_mc_io object refactoring

Each fsl_mc_io object is associated with an fsl_mc_device object
of type "dpmcp" representing the MC portal associated with the
fsl_mc_io object. Before, we were representing this association with
an fsl_mc_resource pointer. To enhance code clarity, it is more
straight forward to use an fsl_mc_device pointer instead.
So, this change replaces the 'resource' field in the fsl_mc_io
object with 'dpmcp_dev'. Also, it changes parameter 'resource' of
fsl_create_mc_io() to be an fsl_mc_device pointer instead.
