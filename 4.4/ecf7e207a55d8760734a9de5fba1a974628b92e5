iio: humidity: si7020: replaced bitmask on humidity values with range check

The maximum possible value for the relative humidity is 55575 (100%RH).
This value, if shifted right by 2 bits, uses 14 bits and masking it with
a 12 bit mask removes 2 meaningful bits.
The masking has been replaced with a range check that sets the minimum
value at 786 (0%RH) and the maximum at 13893 (99.998%RH).
