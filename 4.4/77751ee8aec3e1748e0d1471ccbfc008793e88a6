bridge: vlan: move pvid inside net_bridge_vlan_group

One obvious way to converge more code (which was also used by the
previous vlan code) is to move pvid inside net_bridge_vlan_group. This
allows us to simplify some and remove other port-specific functions.
Also gives us the ability to simply pass the vlan group and use all of the
contained information.
