s390/Kconfig: use builtin bswap

Depending on the gcc version we can use builtin_bswap instead of
architecture functions. Doing so is better than the inline assembly
version of load reverse for two reasons:
- the sequence of load reversed, apply constant mask, save reversed can
  be optimized to load, apply reversed mask, save
- builtins are slightly better to optimize e.g. gcc instruction
  scheduler cannot optimize grouping on inline assemblies.

To enable set we have to ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP.
