6lowpan: cleanup lowpan_header_decompress

This patch changes the lowpan_header_decompress function by removing
inklayer related information from parameters. This is currently for
supporting short and extended address for iphc handling in 802154.
We don't support short address handling anyway right now, but there
exists already code for handling short addresses in
lowpan_header_decompress.

The address parameters are also changed to a void pointer, so 6LoWPAN
linklayer specific code can put complex structures as these parameters
and cast it again inside the generic code by evaluating linklayer type
before. The order is also changed by destination address at first and
then source address, which is the same like all others functions where
destination is always the first, memcpy, dev_hard_header,
lowpan_header_compress, etc.

This patch also moves the fetching of iphc values from 6LoWPAN linklayer
specific code into the generic branch.
