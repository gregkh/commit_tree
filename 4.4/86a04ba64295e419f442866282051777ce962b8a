serial: imx: set up aging timer interrupt as DMA trigger

The DMA transfer is only started once we are sure it will finish
in a limited time, i.e. only after we received a RRDY interrupt.

In order to allow the watermark level to be raised the aging
timer and the corresponding interrupt need to be set up as an
additional trigger, so that the transfer is also started if the
incoming amount of bytes never reach the watermark.
