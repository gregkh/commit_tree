perf probe: Cleanup find_perf_probe_point_from_map to reduce redundancy

In find_perf_probe_point_from_map(), the 'ret' variable is initialized
with -ENOENT but overwritten by the return code of
kernel_get_symbol_address_by_name(), and after that it is re-initialized
with -ENOENT again.

Setting ret=-ENOENT twice looks a bit redundant. This avoids the
overwriting and just returns -ENOENT if some error happens to simplify
the code.
