ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: add AC'97 support

Add AC'97 support to fsl-asoc-card using generic
ASoC AC'97 CODEC.

The SSI controller will silently enable any TX
AC'97 slots that have their bits set in SLOTREQ
received from CODEC and then will redirect some
of playback samples there.

That's why it is important to make sure that
any of CODEC playback slots that can pull samples
are set to slots 3/4 (standard PCM playback slots).
Currently, this applies to S/PDIF slots as they
were seen to pull samples sometimes even with
S/PDIF output being disabled.
