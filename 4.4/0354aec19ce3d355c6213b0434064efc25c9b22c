dma-debug: Fix dma_debug_entry offset calculation

dma-debug uses struct dma_debug_entry to keep track of dma coherent
memory allocation requests. The virtual address is converted into a pfn
and an offset. Previously, the offset was calculated using an incorrect
bit mask.  As a result, we saw incorrect error messages from dma-debug
like the following:

"DMA-API: exceeded 7 overlapping mappings of cacheline 0x03e00000"

Cacheline 0x03e00000 does not exist on our platform.
