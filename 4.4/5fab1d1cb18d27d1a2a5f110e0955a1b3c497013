powerpc: Delete old orphaned PrPMC 280/2800 DTS and boot file.

In commit 3c8464a9b12bf83807b6e2c896d7e7b633e1cae7 ("powerpc:
Delete old PrPMC 280/2800 support") we got rid of most of the C
code, and the Makefile/Kconfig hooks, but it seems I left the
platform's DTS file orphaned in the tree as well as the boot code.
Here we get rid of them both.
