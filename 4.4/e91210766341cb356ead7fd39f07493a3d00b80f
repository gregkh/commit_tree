kasan: update reported bug types for not user nor kernel memory accesses

Each access with address lower than
kasan_shadow_to_mem(KASAN_SHADOW_START) is reported as user-memory-access.
This is not always true, the accessed address might not be in user space.
Fix this by reporting such accesses as null-ptr-derefs or
wild-memory-accesses.

There's another reason for this change.  For userspace ASan we have a
bunch of systems that analyze error types for the purpose of
classification and deduplication.  Sooner of later we will write them to
KASAN as well.  Then clearly and explicitly stated error types will bring
value.
