block: Reduce the size of struct blk_integrity

The per-device properties in the blk_integrity structure were previously
unsigned short. However, most of the values fit inside a char. The only
exception is the data interval size and we can work around that by
storing it as a power of two.

This cuts the size of the dynamic portion of blk_integrity in half.
