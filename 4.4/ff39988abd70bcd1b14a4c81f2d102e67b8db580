dma: Add support to program MIC x100 status descriptiors

The MIC X100 DMA engine has a special status descriptor which writes
an 8 byte value to a destination location.  This is used to signal
completion of all DMA descriptors prior to the status descriptor.
This patch add a new DMA engine API which enables updating a
destination address with an 8 byte immediate data value.
