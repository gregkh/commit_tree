rtc: s3c: Set year, month, day value for setting alarm

This patch sets year, month, day value for set_alarm function.
The current driver omits to set the values.

This fixes setting wake alarm for dates different than current day.
Without the patch the alarm scheduled for tomorrow would fire today on
chosen time.
