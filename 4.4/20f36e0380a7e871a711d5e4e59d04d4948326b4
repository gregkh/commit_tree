xen/x86/pvh: Use HVM's flush_tlb_others op

Using MMUEXT_TLB_FLUSH_MULTI doesn't buy us much since the hypervisor
will likely perform same IPIs as would have the guest.

More importantly, using MMUEXT_INVLPG_MULTI may not to invalidate the
guest's address on remote CPU (when, for example, VCPU from another guest
is running there).
