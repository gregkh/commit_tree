cgroup: replace cgroup_subsys->disabled tests with cgroup_subsys_enabled()

Replace cgroup_subsys->disabled tests in controllers with
cgroup_subsys_enabled().  cgroup_subsys_enabled() requires literal
subsys name as its parameter and thus can't be used for cgroup core
which iterates through controllers.  For cgroup core, introduce and
use cgroup_ssid_enabled() which uses slower static_key_enabled() test
and can be indexed by subsys ID.

This leaves cgroup_subsys->disabled unused.  Removed.
