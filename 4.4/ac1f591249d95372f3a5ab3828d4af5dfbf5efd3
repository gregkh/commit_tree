kernel/watchdog.c: add sysctl knob hardlockup_panic

The only way to enable a hardlockup to panic the machine is to set
'nmi_watchdog=panic' on the kernel command line.

This makes it awkward for end users and folks who want to run automate
tests (like myself).

Mimic the softlockup_panic knob and create a /proc/sys/kernel/hardlockup_panic
knob.
