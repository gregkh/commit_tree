x86/mce: Fix thermal throttling reporting after kexec

The per CPU thermal vector init code checks if the thermal
vector is already installed and complains and bails out if it
is.

This happens after kexec, as kernel shut down does not clear the
thermal vector APIC register.

This causes two problems:

1. So we always do not fully initialize thermal reports after
   kexec. The CPU is still likely initialized, as the previous
   kernel should have done it. But we don't set up the software
   pointer to the thermal vector, so reporting may end up with a
   unknown thermal interrupt message.

2. Also it complains for every logical CPU, even though the
   value is actually derived from BP only.

The problem is that we end up with one message per CPU, so on
larger systems it becomes very noisy and messes up the otherwise
nicely formatted CPU bootup numbers in the kernel log.

Just remove the check. I checked the code and there's no valid
code paths where the thermal init code for a CPU could be called
multiple times.

Why the kernel does not clean up this value on shutdown:

The thermal monitoring is controlled per logical CPU thread.
Normal shutdown code is just running on one CPU. To disable it
we would need a broadcast NMI to all CPUs on shut down. That's
overkill for this. So we just ignore it after kexec.
