mwifiex: don't always include ht/vht info in tdls confirm frame

Current TDLS implementation always includes ht/vht information
in tdls setup confirm frame which causes teardown by legacy
peer station after TDLS handshake. We will inclue ht/vht
capabilities in tdls setup confirm frame only if peer station
supports it to fix this problem.
