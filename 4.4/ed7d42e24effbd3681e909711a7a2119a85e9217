net: qca_spi: fix transmit queue timeout handling

In case of a tx queue timeout every transmit is blocked until the
QCA7000 resets himself and triggers a sync which makes the driver
flushs the tx ring. So avoid this blocking situation by triggering
the sync immediately after the timeout. Waking the queue doesn't
make sense in this situation.
