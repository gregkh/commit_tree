serial: sh-sci: Fix NULL pointer dereference if HIGHMEM is enabled

This patch fixes an issue that this driver causes a NULL pointer
dereference in the following conditions:
 - CONFIG_HIGHMEM and CONFIG_SERIAL_SH_SCI_DMA are enabled
 - This driver runs on the sci_dma_rx_push()

This issue was caused by virt_to_page(buf) in the sci_request_dma()
because this driver didn't check if the "buf" was valid or not.  So,
this patch uses the "buf" from dma_alloc_coherent() as is, not page.

This patch also fixes a WARNING issue in sci_rx_dma_release():
