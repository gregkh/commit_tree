ARM: versatile: fix MMC/SD interrupt assignment

Commit 0976c946a610d06e907335b7a3afa6db046f8e1b
"arm/versatile: Fix versatile irq specifications"
has an off-by-one error on the Versatile AB that has
been regressing the Versatile AB hardware for some time.

However it seems like the interrupt assignments have
never been correct and I have now adjusted them according
to the specification. The masks for the valid interrupts
made it impossible to assign the right SIC interrupt
for the MMCI, so I went in and fixed these to correspond
to the specifications, and added references if anyone
wants to double-check.

Due to the Versatile PB including the Versatile AB
as a base DTS file, we need to override and correct
some values to correspond to the actual changes in the
hardware.

For the Versatile PB I don't think the IRQ line
assignment for MMCI has ever been correct for either of
the two MMCI blocks. It would be nice if someone with the
physical PB board could test this.

Patch tested on the Versatile AB, QEMU for Versatile AB
and QEMU for Versatile PB.
