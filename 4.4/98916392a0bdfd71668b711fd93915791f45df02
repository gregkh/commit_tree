perf tools: Allow shuffling the build tests

Those tests take a long time and sometimes we stop it, so allow randomly
shuffling the tests so that we have a better chance of running more of
them in partial 'make build-test' runs.

Using it just on the 'build-test' target, i.e.:

   make -C tools/perf build-test

Is equivalent to:

   make SHUF=1 -C tools/perf -f tests/make
