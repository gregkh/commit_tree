perf probe: Fix memory leaking on failure by clearing all probe_trace_events

Fix memory leaking on the debuginfo__find_trace_events() failure path
which frees an array of probe_trace_events but doesn't clears all the
allocated sub-structures and strings.

So, before doing zfree(tevs), clear all the array elements which may
have allocated resources.
