dax: fix __dax_pmd_fault crash

Since 4.3 introduced devm_memremap_pages() the pfns handled by DAX may
optionally have a struct page backing.  When a mapped pfn reaches
vmf_insert_pfn_pmd() it fails with a crash signature like the following:

 kernel BUG at mm/huge_memory.c:905!
 [..]
 Call Trace:
  [<ffffffff812a73ba>] __dax_pmd_fault+0x2ea/0x5b0
  [<ffffffffa01a4182>] xfs_filemap_pmd_fault+0x92/0x150 [xfs]
  [<ffffffff811fbe02>] handle_mm_fault+0x312/0x1b50

Fix this by falling back to 4K mappings in the pfn_valid() case.  Longer
term, vmf_insert_pfn_pmd() needs to grow support for architectures that
can provide a 'pmd_special' capability.
