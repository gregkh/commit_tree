xen-netback: use RING_COPY_REQUEST() throughout

Instead of open-coding memcpy()s and directly accessing Tx and Rx
requests, use the new RING_COPY_REQUEST() that ensures the local copy
is correct.

This is more than is strictly necessary for guest Rx requests since
only the id and gref fields are used and it is harmless if the
frontend modifies these.

This is part of XSA155.
