arm64: perf: move to shared arm_pmu framework

Now that the arm_pmu framework has been factored out to drivers/perf we
can make use of it for arm64, gaining support for heterogeneous PMUs
and unifying the two codebases before they diverge further.

The as yet unused PMU name for PMUv3 is changed to armv8_pmuv3, matching
the style previously applied to the 32-bit PMUs.
