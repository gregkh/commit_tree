ALSA: firewire-tascam: fix loop condition with some readable variables

In transactions for MIDI messages, the first byte is used for label and
the rest is for MIDI bytes. In current code, these are handled correctly,
while there's a small mistake for loop condition to include meaningless
statement.

This commit adds two local variables for them and improve the loop
condition.
