ARM: tegra: Rebuild default configuration on v4.3-rc1

As a result of rebuilding the configuration the following symbols are
removed:

  - EXT4_FS: ext3 has finally been removed from the kernel. ext4
    provides feature parity and can be used to mount ext3 filesystems.
    EXT3_FS selects EXT4_FS.
  - EXT3_DEFAULTS_TO_ORDERED: Removed as part of the ext3 filesystem
    removal.
  - IPV6: IPv6 is now built-in by default
