rcu: Invert passed_quiesce and rename to cpu_no_qs

This commit inverts the sense of the rcu_data structure's ->passed_quiesce
field and renames it to ->cpu_no_qs.  This will allow a later commit to
use an "aggregate OR" operation to test expedited as well as normal grace
periods without added overhead.
