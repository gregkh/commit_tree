net: phy: bcm-phy-lib: Fix module license issue

The 'bcm-phy-lib.c', added as a part of the commit
"net: phy: Add Broadcom phy library for common interfaces"
was missing the module license. This was causing an issue
when the library is built as a module; "module license
'unspecified' taints kernel".

This patch fixes the issue by adding the module license,
author and description to the bcm-phy-lib.c file.
