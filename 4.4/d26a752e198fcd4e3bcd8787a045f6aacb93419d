staging: rtl8723au: hal: Remove useless intialisation

Remove intialisation of a variable that is immediately reassigned. The
problem was found using coccinelle semantic patch and further
opportunities were identified by hand.

The semantic patch used to find this is:

// <smpl>
@@
type T;
identifier x;
constant C;
expression e;
@@

T x
- = C
 ;
x = e;
// </smpl>
