dm: eliminate unused "bioset" process for each bio-based DM device

Commit 54efd50bfd873e2dbf784e0b21a8027ba4299a3e ("block: make
generic_make_request handle arbitrarily sized bios") makes it possible
for block devices to process large bios.  In doing so that commit
allocates a new queue->bio_split bioset for each block device, this
bioset is used for allocating bios when the driver needs to split large
bios.

Each bioset allocates a workqueue process, thus the above commit
increases the number of processes allocated per block device.

DM doesn't need the queue->bio_split bioset, thus we can deallocate it.
This reduces the number of allocated processes per bio-based DM device
from 3 to 2.  Also remove the call to blk_queue_split(), it is not
needed because DM does its own splitting.
