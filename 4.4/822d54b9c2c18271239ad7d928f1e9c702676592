netpoll: Drop budget parameter from NAPI polling call hierarchy

For some reason we were carrying the budget value around between the
various calls to napi->poll.  If for example one of the drivers called had
a bug in which it returned a non-zero value for work this could result in
the budget value becoming negative.

Rather than carry around a value of budget that is 0 or less we can instead
just loop through and pass 0 to each napi->poll call.  If any driver
returns a value for work done that is non-zero then we can report that
driver and continue rather than allowing a bad actor to make the budget
value negative and pass that negative value to napi->poll.

Note, the only actual change here is that instead of letting budget become
negative we are keeping it at 0 regardless of the value returned for work
since it should not be possible for the polling routine to do any actual
work with a budget of 0.  So if the polling routine returns a non-0 value
we are just reporting it and continuing with a budget of 0 rather than
letting that work value be subtracted from the budget of 0.
