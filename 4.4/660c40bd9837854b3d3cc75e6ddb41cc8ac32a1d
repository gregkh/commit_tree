pinctrl: sh-pfc: Remove obsolete r8a7778 platform_device_id entry

Since the removal of the r8a7778 legacy SoC code in commit
4baadb9e05c68962 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7778: remove obsolete setup code"),
r8a7778 is only supported in generic DT-only ARM multi-platform builds.
The driver doesn't need to match platform devices by name anymore, hence
remove the corresponding platform_device_id entry.
