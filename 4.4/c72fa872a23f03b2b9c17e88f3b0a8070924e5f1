tipc: eliminate link's reference to owner node

With the recent commit series, we have established a one-way dependency
between the link aggregation (struct tipc_node) instances and their
pertaining tipc_link instances. This has enabled quite significant code
and structure simplifications.

In this commit, we eliminate the field 'owner', which points to an
instance of struct tipc_node, from struct tipc_link, and replace it with
a pointer to struct net, which is the only external reference now needed
by a link instance.
