Input: xpad - remove needless bulk out URB used for LED setup

This code was probably wrong ever since and is redundant with
xpad_send_led_command. Both try to send a similar command to the xbox360
controller. However xpad_send_led_command correctly uses the pad_nr instead
of bInterfaceNumber to select the led and re-uses the irq_out URB instead
of creating a new one.

Note that this change only affects the two supported wireless controllers.
Tested using the xbox360 wireless controller (PC).
