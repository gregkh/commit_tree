net/xen-netfront: Make it running on 64KB page granularity

The PV network protocol is using 4KB page granularity. The goal of this
patch is to allow a Linux using 64KB page granularity using network
device on a non-modified Xen.

It's only necessary to adapt the ring size and break skb data in small
chunk of 4KB. The rest of the code is relying on the grant table code.

Note that we allocate a Linux page for each rx skb but only the first
4KB is used. We may improve the memory usage by extending the size of
the rx skb.
