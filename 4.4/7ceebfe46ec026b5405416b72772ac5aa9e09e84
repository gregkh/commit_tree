netfilter: nfqueue: don't use prev pointer

Usage of -prev seems buggy.  While packet was out our hook cannot be
removed but we have no way to know if the previous one is still valid.

So better not use ->prev at all.  Since NF_REPEAT just asks to invoke
same hook function again, just do so, and continue with nf_interate
if we get an ACCEPT verdict.

A side effect of this change is that if nf_reinject(NF_REPEAT) causes
another REPEAT we will now drop the skb instead of a kernel loop.

However, NF_REPEAT loops would be a bug so this should not happen anyway.
