KVM: x86: Add KVM exit for IOAPIC EOIs

Adds KVM_EXIT_IOAPIC_EOI which allows the kernel to EOI
level-triggered IOAPIC interrupts.

Uses a per VCPU exit bitmap to decide whether or not the IOAPIC needs
to be informed (which is identical to the EOI_EXIT_BITMAP field used
by modern x86 processors, but can also be used to elide kvm IOAPIC EOI
exits on older processors).

[Note: A prototype using ResampleFDs found that decoupling the EOI
from the VCPU's thread made it possible for the VCPU to not see a
recent EOI after reentering the guest. This does not match real
hardware.]

Compile tested for Intel x86.
