irqchip / ACPI: Add probing infrastructure for ACPI-based irqchips

DT enjoys a rather nice probing infrastructure for irqchips, while
ACPI is so far stuck into a very distant past.

This patch introduces a declarative API, allowing irqchips to be
self-contained and be called when a particular entry is matched
in the MADT table.
