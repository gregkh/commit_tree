ver_linux: ldd, look for numerical input, not field number

Rely on regex to find the version number, rather than rely on numerical input to be found in a particular input field.
Proposed implementation also eliminates the necessity to invoke 'head' + 'awk'.

The '-v' flag either seems to have been deprecated in some distros, e.g. Gentoo, or is an alias for '--version' in others. The proposed implementation uses the latter flag only.
