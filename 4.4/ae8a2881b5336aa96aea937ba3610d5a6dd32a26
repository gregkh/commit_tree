dt-bindings: Correct the example for Exynos power domain clocks

Since commit 29e5eea06bc1 ("ARM: EXYNOS: Get current parent clock for
power domain on/off") the "pclkN" names of "clock-names" property is not
parsed any more. The bindings and driver were updated but the example
was not. Fix the example now.
