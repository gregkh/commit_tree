tcp: do not set queue_mapping on SYNACK

At the time of commit fff326990789 ("tcp: reflect SYN queue_mapping into
SYNACK packets") we had little ways to cope with SYN floods.

We no longer need to reflect incoming skb queue mappings, and instead
can pick a TX queue based on cpu cooking the SYNACK, with normal XPS
affinities.

Note that all SYNACK retransmits were picking TX queue 0, this no longer
is a win given that SYNACK rtx are now distributed on all cpus.
