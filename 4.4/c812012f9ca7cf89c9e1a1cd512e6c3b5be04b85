nfs: if we have no valid attrs, then don't declare the attribute cache valid

If we pass in an empty nfs_fattr struct to nfs_update_inode, it will
(correctly) not update any of the attributes, but it then clears the
NFS_INO_INVALID_ATTR flag, which indicates that the attributes are
up to date. Don't clear the flag if the fattr struct has no valid
attrs to apply.
