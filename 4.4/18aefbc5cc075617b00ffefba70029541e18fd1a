drivers/firmware: Make efi/esrt.c driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this driver is currently hidden with:

config EFI_ESRT
        bool

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We leave some tags like MODULE_AUTHOR for documentation purposes.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
