xen/events: Always allocate legacy interrupts on PV guests

After commit 8c058b0b9c34 ("x86/irq: Probe for PIC presence before
allocating descs for legacy IRQs") early_irq_init() will no longer
preallocate descriptors for legacy interrupts if PIC does not
exist, which is the case for Xen PV guests.

Therefore we may need to allocate those descriptors ourselves.
