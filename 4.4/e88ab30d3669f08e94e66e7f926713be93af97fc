Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Add suspend/resume runtime PM functions

Adds autosuspend runtime functionality to BCM UART driver.
Autosuspend is enabled at end of bcm_setup.

bcm_device_lock is used for system sleep functions as they can be
called at any time.
bcm_device_lock is not held for runtime suspend functions as this
is only enabled as long as platform device is opened.
