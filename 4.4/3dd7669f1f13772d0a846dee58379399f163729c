ipv6: use ktime_t for internal timestamps

The ipv6 mip6 implementation is one of only a few users of the
skb_get_timestamp() function in the kernel, which is both unsafe
on 32-bit architectures because of the 2038 overflow, and slightly
less efficient than the skb_get_ktime() based approach.

This converts the function call and the mip6_report_rate_limiter
structure that stores the time stamp, eliminating all uses of
timeval in the ipv6 code.
