raid5: add a new state for stripe log handling

When a stripe finishes construction, we write the stripe to raid in
ops_run_io normally. With log, we do a bunch of other operations before
the stripe is written to raid. Mainly write the stripe to log disk,
flush disk cache and so on. The operations are still driven by raid5d
and run in the stripe state machine. We introduce a new state for such
stripe (trapped into log). The stripe is in this state from the time it
first enters ops_run_io (finish construction) to the time it is written
to raid. Since we know the state is only for log, we bypass other
check/operation in handle_stripe.
