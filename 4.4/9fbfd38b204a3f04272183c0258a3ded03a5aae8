ALSA: firewire-digi00x: add support for MIDI ports corresponding to isochronous packet streaming

This commit adds MIDI functionality to capture/playback MIDI messages
from/to physical MIDI ports. These messages are transferred in isochronous
packets.

When no substreams request AMDTP streams to run, this driver starts the
streams at current sampling rate. When other substreams start at different
sampling rate, the streams are stopped temporarily, then start again at
requested sampling rate. This operation can generate missing MIDI bytes,
thus it's preferable to start PCM substreams at favorite sampling rate in
advance.

Digi 002/003 console also has a set of MIDI port for physical controls.
These ports are added in later commits.
