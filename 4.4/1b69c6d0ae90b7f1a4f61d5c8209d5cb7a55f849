net: Introduce L3 Master device abstraction

L3 master devices allow users of the abstraction to influence FIB lookups
for enslaved devices. Current API provides a means for the master device
to return a specific FIB table for an enslaved device, to return an
rtable/custom dst and influence the OIF used for fib lookups.
