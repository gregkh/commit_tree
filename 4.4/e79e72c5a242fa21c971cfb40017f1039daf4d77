i2c: designware: Keep pm_runtime_enable/_disable calls in sync

On an hardware shared I2C bus (certain Intel Baytrail SoC platforms) the
runtime PM disable depth keeps increasing over repeated modprobe/rmmod
cycle because pm_runtime_disable() is called without checking should it
be disabled already because of bus sharing.

This hasn't made any other harm than dev->power.disable_depth keeps
increasing but keep it sync by calling pm_runtime_disable() only when
runtime PM is not disabled.
