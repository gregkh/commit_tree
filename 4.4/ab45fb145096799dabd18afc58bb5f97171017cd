xtensa: fix secondary core boot in SMP

There are multiple factors adding to the issue in different
configurations:

- commit 17290231df16eeee ("xtensa: add fixup for double exception raised
  in window overflow") added function window_overflow_restore_a0_fixup to
  double exception vector overlapping reset vector location of secondary
  processor cores.
- on MMUv2 cores RESET_VECTOR1_VADDR may point to uncached kernel memory
  making code overlapping depend on cache type and size, so that without
  cache or with WT cache reset vector code overwrites double exception
  code, making issue even harder to detect.
- on MMUv3 cores RESET_VECTOR1_VADDR may point to unmapped area, as
  MMUv3 cores change virtual address map to match MMUv2 layout, but
  reset vector virtual address is given for the original MMUv3 mapping.
- physical memory region of the secondary reset vector is not reserved
  in the physical memory map, and thus may be allocated and overwritten
  at arbitrary moment.

Fix it as follows:

- move window_overflow_restore_a0_fixup code to .text section.
- define RESET_VECTOR1_VADDR so that it points to reset vector in the
  cacheable MMUv2 map for cores with MMU.
- reserve reset vector region in the physical memory map. Drop separate
  literal section and build mxhead.S with text section literals.
