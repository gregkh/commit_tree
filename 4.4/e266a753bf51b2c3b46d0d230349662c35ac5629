perf symbols: Fix dso lookup by long name and missing buildids

Commit 4598a0a6d22f ("perf symbols: Improve DSO long names lookup speed
with rbtree") Added a tree to lookup dsos by long name.  That tree gets
corrupted whenever a dso long name is changed because the tree is not
updated.

One effect of that is buildid-list does not work with the 'with-hits'
option because dso lookup fails and results in two structs for the same
dso.  The first has the buildid but no hits, the second has hits but no
buildid. e.g.

Before:

  $ tools/perf/perf record ls
  arch     certs    CREDITS  Documentation  firmware  include
  ipc      Kconfig  lib      Makefile       net       REPORTING-BUGS
  scripts  sound    usr      block          COPYING   crypto
  drivers  fs       init     Kbuild         kernel    MAINTAINERS
  mm       README   samples  security       tools     virt
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.012 MB perf.data (11 samples) ]
  $ tools/perf/perf buildid-list
  574da826c66538a8d9060d393a8866289bd06005 [kernel.kallsyms]
  30c94dc66a1fe95180c3d68d2b89e576d5ae213c /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
  $ tools/perf/perf buildid-list -H
  574da826c66538a8d9060d393a8866289bd06005 [kernel.kallsyms]
  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so

After:

  $ tools/perf/perf buildid-list -H
  574da826c66538a8d9060d393a8866289bd06005 [kernel.kallsyms]
  30c94dc66a1fe95180c3d68d2b89e576d5ae213c /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so

The fix is to record the root of the tree on the dso so that
dso__set_long_name() can update the tree when the long name changes.
