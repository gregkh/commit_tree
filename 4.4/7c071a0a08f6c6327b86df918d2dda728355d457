power: bq24257: Add SW-based approach for Power Good determination

A software-based approach for determining the charger's input voltage
"Power Good" state is introduced for devices like the bq24250 which
don't have a dedicated hardware pin for that purpose. This SW-based
approach is also used for other devices (with dedicated PG pin) as a
fall back solution if that pin is not configured to be used through
"pg-gpios".
