fm10k: re-enable VF after a full reset on detection of a Malicious event

Modify behavior of Malicious Driver Detection events. Presently, the
hardware disables the VF queues and re-assigns them to the PF. This
causes the VF in question to continuously Tx hang, because it assumes
that it can transmit over the queues in question. For transient events,
this results in continuous logging of malicious events.

New behavior is to reset the LPORT and VF state, so that the VF will
have to reset and re-enable itself. This does mean that malicious VFs
will possibly be able to continue and attempt malicious events again.
However, it is expected that system administrators will step in and
manually remove or disable the VF in question.
