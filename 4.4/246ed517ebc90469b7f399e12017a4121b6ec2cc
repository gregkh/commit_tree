Staging: most: Remove exceptional & on function name

In this file, function names are otherwise used as pointers without &.

A simplified version of the Coccinelle semantic patch that makes this
change is as follows:

// <smpl>
@r@
identifier f;
@@

f(...) { ... }
@@
identifier r.f;
@@

- &f
+ f
// </smpl>
