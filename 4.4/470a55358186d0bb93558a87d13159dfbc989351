IB/core: Add support of checksum capability reporting for RC and RAW

Two enum members IB_DEVICE_RC_IP_CSUM and IB_DEVICE_RAW_IP_CSUM are
added to ib_device_cap_flags. Device should set these two flags if they support
insertion of UDP and TCP checksum on outgoing IPv4 messages and can verify the
validity of checksum for incoming IPv4 messages, for RC IPoIB and RAW over
Ethernet respectively. They are similar to IB_DEVICE_UD_IP_CSUM.
