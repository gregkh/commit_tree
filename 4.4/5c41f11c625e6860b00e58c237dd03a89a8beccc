mfd: atmel-flexcom: Add a driver for Atmel Flexible Serial Communication Unit

This driver supports the new Atmel Flexcom. The Flexcom is a wrapper which
integrates one SPI controller, one I2C controller and one USART. Only one
function can be enabled at a time. This driver selects the function once
for all, when the Flexcom is probed, according to the value of the new
"atmel,flexcom-mode" device tree property.

This driver has chosen to present the Flexcom to the system as a MFD so
the implementation is seamless for the existing Atmel SPI, I2C and USART
drivers.

Also the Flexcom embeds FIFOs: the latest patches of the SPI, I2C and
USART drivers take advantage of this new feature.
