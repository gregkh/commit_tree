bridge: vlan: fix possible null ptr derefs on port init and deinit

When a new port is being added we need to make vlgrp available after
rhashtable has been initialized and when removing a port we need to
flush the vlans and free the resources after we're sure noone can use
the port, i.e. after it's removed from the port list and synchronize_rcu
is executed.
