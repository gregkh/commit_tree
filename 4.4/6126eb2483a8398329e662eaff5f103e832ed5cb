Revert "block: Split bios on chunk boundaries"

This reverts commit d3805611130af9b911e908af9f67a3f64f4f0914.

If we end up splitting on the first segment, we don't adjust
the sector count. That results in hitting a BUG() with attempting
to split 0 sectors.

As this is just a performance issue and not a regression since
4.3 release, let's just rever this change. That gives us more
time to test a real fix for 4.5, which would be marked for
stable anyway.
