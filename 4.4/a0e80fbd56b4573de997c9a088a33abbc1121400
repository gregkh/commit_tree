USB: serial: Another Infineon flash loader USB ID

The flash loader has been seen on a Telit UE910 modem. The flash loader
is a bit special, it presents both an ACM and CDC Data interface but
only the latter is useful. Unless a magic string is sent to the device
it will disappear and the regular modem device appears instead.
