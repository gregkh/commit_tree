ixgbe: Reset interface after enabling SR-IOV

Enabling SR-IOV and then bringing the interface up was resulting in the PF
MAC addresses getting into a bad state.  Specifically the MAC address was
enabled for both VF 0 and the PF.  This resulted in some odd behaviors such
as VF 0 receiving a copy of the PFs traffic, which in turn enables the
ability for VF 0 to spoof the PF.

A workaround for this issue appears to be to bring up the interface first
and then enable SR-IOV as this way the reset is then triggered in the
existing code.

In order to correct this I have added a change to ixgbe_setup_tc where if
the interface is down we still will at least call ixgbe_reset so that the
MAC addresses for the device are reset to the correct pools.

Steps to reproduce issue:
modprobe ixgbe
echo 7 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.1/sriov_numvfs
ifconfig enp1s0f1 up
ethregs -s 1:00.1 | grep MPSAR | grep -v 00000000

Result:
	MPSAR[0]               00000081
	MPSAR[254]             00000001

Expected Result, behavior after patch:
	MPSAR[0]               00000080
	MPSAR[254]             00000080
