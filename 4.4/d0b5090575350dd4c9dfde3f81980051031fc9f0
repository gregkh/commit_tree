ARM: OMAP2+: Rename cpu_is macros to soc_is

The naming for the cpu_is macros is confusing as the CPU is separate
and within the SoC. Let's rename all the macros to soc_is, and let's
define cpu_is also for the ones still in use. Then we can just remove
the cpu_is macros once the users are fixed up.

To keep the chances of breaking anything, the changes were
generated with the following regular expressions:

s/cpu_is/soc_is/g
s/CPU/SoC/g

Then the list of existing cpu_is users was generated with:

$ $ grep -o -e 'cpu_is_.\+()' arch/arm/mach-omap2/*.[chS] | \
	cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq

And added to the end of the soc.h.

I decided to rework the earlier patches by Keerthy <j-keerthy@ti.com>
to keep changes down to minimum to avoid potential errors and stick
to just search and replace.
