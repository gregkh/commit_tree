xen/pciback: Return error on XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi when device has MSI or MSI-X enabled

The guest sequence of:

 a) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi
 b) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi
 c) XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi

results in hitting an BUG_ON condition in the msi.c code.

The MSI code uses an dev->msi_list to which it adds MSI entries.
Under the above conditions an BUG_ON() can be hit. The device
passed in the guest MUST have MSI capability.

The a) adds the entry to the dev->msi_list and sets msi_enabled.
The b) adds a second entry but adding in to SysFS fails (duplicate entry)
and deletes all of the entries from msi_list and returns (with msi_enabled
is still set).  c) pci_disable_msi passes the msi_enabled checks and hits:

BUG_ON(list_empty(dev_to_msi_list(&dev->dev)));

and blows up.

The patch adds a simple check in the XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi to guard
against that. The check for msix_enabled is not stricly neccessary.

This is part of XSA-157.
