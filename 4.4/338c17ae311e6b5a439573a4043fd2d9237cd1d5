mac80211: use DECLARE_EWMA for ave_beacon_signal

It doesn't seem problematic to change the weight for the average
beacon signal from 3 to 4, so use DECLARE_EWMA. This also makes
the code easier to maintain since bugs like the one fixed in the
previous patch can't happen as easily.

With a fix from Avraham Stern to invert the sign since EMWA uses
unsigned values only.
