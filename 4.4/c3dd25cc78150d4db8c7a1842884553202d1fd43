pinctrl: fix qcom ssbi drivers for 64-bit compilation

When building pinctrl-ssbi-gpio and pinctrl-ssbi-mpp for ARM64, we get
a compile warning about invalid types:

drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-ssbi-gpio.c: In function 'pm8xxx_gpio_probe':
drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-ssbi-gpio.c:675:17: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-ssbi-mpp.c: In function 'pm8xxx_mpp_probe':
drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-ssbi-mpp.c:766:17: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]

This changes the code so we cast the pointer to 'unsigned long', which
is the right thing to do here.
