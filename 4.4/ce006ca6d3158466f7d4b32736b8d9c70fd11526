rtc: da9063: GPL copyright inconsistency fix

Fix misleading and inconsistent copyright header wording.

Alter the copyright header text and MODULE_LICENSE macro to ensure the
GPL v2 licence description is correctly represented.

It will remove the incorrectly LGPL worded text. Words such as "Library"
from the line "GNU Library General Public License"; and replace the word
"library" with "program" in several other places.

The copyright should match the GPL v2 description as specified in the GNU
license found here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

It should also match this copyright text with the correct MODULE_LICENSE
macro text as found in the kernel: include/linux/module.h
In this case "GNU Public License v2 or later" is linked with "GPL".
