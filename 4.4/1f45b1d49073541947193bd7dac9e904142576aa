perf bpf: Attach eBPF filter to perf event

This is the final patch which makes basic BPF filter work. After
applying this patch, users are allowed to use BPF filter like:

 # perf record --event ./hello_world.o ls

A bpf_fd field is appended to 'struct evsel', and setup during the
callback function add_bpf_event() for each 'probe_trace_event'.

PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_BPF ioctl is used to attach eBPF program to a newly
created perf event. The file descriptor of the eBPF program is passed to
perf record using previous patches, and stored into evsel->bpf_fd.

It is possible that different perf event are created for one kprobe
events for different CPUs. In this case, when trying to call the ioctl,
EEXIST will be return. This patch doesn't treat it as an error.

Committer note:

The bpf proggie used so far:

  __attribute__((section("fork=_do_fork"), used))
  int fork(void *ctx)
  {
	  return 0;
  }

  char _license[] __attribute__((section("license"), used)) = "GPL";
  int _version __attribute__((section("version"), used)) = 0x40300;

failed to produce any samples, even with forks happening and it being
running in system wide mode.

That is because now the filter is being associated, and the code above
always returns zero, meaning that all forks will be probed but filtered
away ;-/

Change it to 'return 1;' instead and after that:

  # trace --no-syscalls --event /tmp/foo.o
     0.000 perf_bpf_probe:fork:(ffffffff8109be30))
     2.333 perf_bpf_probe:fork:(ffffffff8109be30))
     3.725 perf_bpf_probe:fork:(ffffffff8109be30))
     4.550 perf_bpf_probe:fork:(ffffffff8109be30))
  ^C#

And it works with all tools, including 'perf trace'.
