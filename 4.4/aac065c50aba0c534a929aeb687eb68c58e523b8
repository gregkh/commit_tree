tcp: move qlen/young out of struct listen_sock

qlen_inc & young_inc were protected by listener lock,
while qlen_dec & young_dec were atomic fields.

Everything needs to be atomic for upcoming lockless listener.

Also move qlen/young in request_sock_queue as we'll get rid
of struct listen_sock eventually.
