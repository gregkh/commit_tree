i2c: mv64xxx: The n clockdiv factor is 0 based on sunxi SoCs

According to the datasheets the n factor for dividing the tclk is
2 to the power n on AllwinnerÂ SoCs, not 2 to the power n + 1 as it is
on other mv64xxx implementations.

I've contacted Allwinner about this and they have confirmed that the
datasheet is correct.

This commit fixes the clk-divider calculations for Allwinner SoCs
accordingly.
