mm: fix swapped Movable and Reclaimable in /proc/pagetypeinfo

Commit 016c13daa5c9 ("mm, page_alloc: use masks and shifts when
converting GFP flags to migrate types") has swapped MIGRATE_MOVABLE and
MIGRATE_RECLAIMABLE in the enum definition.  However, migratetype_names
wasn't updated to reflect that.

As a result, the file /proc/pagetypeinfo shows the counts for Movable as
Reclaimable and vice versa.

Additionally, commit 0aaa29a56e4f ("mm, page_alloc: reserve pageblocks
for high-order atomic allocations on demand") introduced
MIGRATE_HIGHATOMIC, but did not add a letter to distinguish it into
show_migration_types(), so it doesn't appear in the listing of free
areas during page alloc failures or oom kills.

This patch fixes both problems.  The atomic reserves will show with a
letter 'H' in the free areas listings.
