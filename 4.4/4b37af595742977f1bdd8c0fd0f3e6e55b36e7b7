perf top: Fix unresolved comm when -s comm is used

The perf top uses 'dso,symbol' sort keys by default so it overlooked a
problem in task's comm resolving.  When the sort key contains 'comm',
some task's comm is not shown properly.  This is because the
perf_top__mmap_read_idx() checks the cpumode value improperly.

The cpumode value of non-sample events are 0 (PERF_RECORD_MISC_CPUMODE_
UNKNOWN) so the events will be ignored by the switch statement.  This patch
allows it for non-sample events.
