tracing: Add trace options for tracer options to instances

Add the tracer options to instances options directory as well. Only add the
options for tracers that are allowed to be enabled by an instance. But note,
that tracer options are global. That is, tracer options enabled in an
instance, also take affect at the top level and in other instances.
