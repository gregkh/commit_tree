KVM: x86: allow RSM from 64-bit mode

The SDM says that exiting system management mode from 64-bit mode
is invalid, but that would be too good to be true.  But actually,
most of the code is already there to support exiting from compat
mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0).  Getting all the way from 64-bit
mode to real mode only requires clearing CS.L and CR4.PCIDE.
