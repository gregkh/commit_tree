Staging: lustre: ptlrpc: pack_generic: Declare local functions as static

Declare lustre_swab_ldlm_resource_desc, lustre_swab_obdo,
lustre_swab_ldlm_res_id, lustre_swab_ldlm_policy_data as static since
they are used only in this particular file. Also remove the corresponding
declarations from header file.
