Staging: comedi: Use mutex instead of semaphore in ni_usb6501.c

Replace binary semaphore with mutex because mutex gives better
performance.
This change is safe because the thread that decrements the value of semaphore
is also the one that increments it, and acts like a mutex where owner of the
lock is the only one that can release the lock.
