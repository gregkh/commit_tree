sctp: use GFP_USER for user-controlled kmalloc

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the user could trigger a kernel warning by
using a large len value for getsockopt SCTP_GET_LOCAL_ADDRS, as that
value directly affects the value used as a kmalloc() parameter.

This patch thus switches the allocation flags from all user-controllable
kmalloc size to GFP_USER to put some more restrictions on it and also
disables the warn, as they are not necessary.
