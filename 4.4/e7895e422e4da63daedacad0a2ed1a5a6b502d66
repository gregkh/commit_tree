perf probe: Split del_perf_probe_events()

The del_perf_probe_events() does 2 things:

1. find existing events which match to filter
2. delete such trace events from kernel

But sometimes we need to do something with the trace events.  So split
the funtion into two, so that it can access intermediate trace events
name using strlist if needed.
