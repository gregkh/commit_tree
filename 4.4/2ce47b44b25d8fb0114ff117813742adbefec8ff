selftests/seccomp: Get page size from sysconf

The commit fd88d16c58c2 ("selftests/seccomp: Be more precise with
syscall arguments.") use PAGE_SIZE directly which lead to build
failure on arm64.

Replace it with generic interface(sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)) to fix this
failure.

Build and test successful on x86_64 and arm64.
