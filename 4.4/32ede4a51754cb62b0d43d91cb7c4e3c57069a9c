serial: tegra: Add helper function for handling RX buffer

In the tegra UART driver there are three places where the RX DMA buffer
is handled and pushed up to the tty layer. In all three instances the
same functions are called and so instead of duplicating the code in three
places, move this code to a new helper function and use this new function.
