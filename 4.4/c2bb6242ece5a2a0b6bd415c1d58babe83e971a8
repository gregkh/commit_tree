raid5: journal disk can't be removed

raid5-cache uses journal disk rdev->bdev, rdev->mddev in several places.
Don't allow journal disk disappear magically. On the other hand, we do
need to update superblock for other disks to bump up ->events, so next
time journal disk will be identified as stale.
