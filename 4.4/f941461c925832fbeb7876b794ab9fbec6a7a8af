ARM: net: bpf: fix zero right shift

The LSR instruction cannot be used to perform a zero right shift since a
0 as the immediate value (imm5) in the LSR instruction encoding means
that a shift of 32 is perfomed.  See DecodeIMMShift() in the ARM ARM.

Make the JIT skip generation of the LSR if a zero-shift is requested.
