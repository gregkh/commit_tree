staging/lustre/obdclass: reorganize busy object accounting

Due to some accounting bug, lsb_busy of a hash bucket can become
larger than the total number of objects in said bucket. A busy object
can be counted more than once. When that happens, a negative value is
returned by the shrinker callback.

Instead of trying (and failing) to count the busy objects, count the
objects than are not busy, i.e. the objects that are present on the
lsb_lru list. The number of busy objects is then the difference
between the number of objects in the hash and the objects on the
lsb_lru list.
