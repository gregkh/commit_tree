pinctrl: uniphier: set input-enable before pin-muxing

While IECTRL is disabled, input signals are pulled-down internally.
If pin-muxing is set up first, glitch signals (Low to High transition)
might be input to hardware blocks.

Bad case scenario:
[1] The hardware block is already running before pinctrl is handled.
   (the reset is de-asserted by default or by a firmware, for example)
[2] The pin-muxing is set up.  The input signals to hardware block
    are pulled-down by the chip-internal biasing.
[3] The pins are input-enabled.  The signals from the board reach the
    hardware block.

Actually, one invalid character is input to the UART blocks for such
SoCs as PH1-LD4, PH1-sLD8, where UART devices start to run at the
power on reset.

To avoid such problems, pins should be input-enabled before muxing.
