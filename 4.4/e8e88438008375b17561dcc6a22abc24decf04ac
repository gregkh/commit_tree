HID: sensor-hub: Add quirk for Lenovo Yoga 2 with ITE Chips

This patch is a follow-up to 47eeca8a48 (" HID: sensor-hub: Add in quirk
for Lenovo Yogas with ITE")

The Lenovo Yoga 2 13 seems to be sold in multiple variants with minor
difference3s. IN my case, the USB ID for ITE chip is different than the
Yoga 2 11 and Yoga 3 14.

Without the quirk, no data is received from the accelerometer. I have
verified the patch, testing this on 4.3-rc4 (and 4.2 stable). With this
patch, proper orientation data is received.
