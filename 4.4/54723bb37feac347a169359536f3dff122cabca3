arm/arm64: KVM: Use appropriate define in VGIC reset code

We currently initialize the SGIs to be enabled in the VGIC code, but we
use the VGIC_NR_PPIS define for this purpose, instead of the the more
natural VGIC_NR_SGIS.  Change this slightly confusing use of the
defines.

Note: This should have no functional change, as both names are defined
to the number 16.
