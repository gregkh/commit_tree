perf record: Allocate area for sample_id_hdr in a synthesized comm event

A previous patch added a synthesized comm event for forked child process
but it missed that the event should contain area for sample_id_hdr at
the end.  It worked by accident since the perf_event union contains
bigger event structs like mmap_events.

This patch fixes it by dynamically allocating event struct including
those area like in perf_event__synthesize_thread_map().
