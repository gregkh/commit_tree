cpufreq: imx: update the clock switch flow to support imx6ul

For i.MX6UL, the clock switch flow is slightly different from
other i.MX6 SOCs. It has a 'secondary_sel' clk that will be used
when the CPU freq is higher than 396MHz. So the clock switch flow in
'set_target' callback need to update to support i.MX6UL in the common
i.MX6 SOC cpufreq driver.
