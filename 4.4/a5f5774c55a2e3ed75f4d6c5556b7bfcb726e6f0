mmc: block: Add new ioctl to send multi commands

Certain eMMC devices allow vendor specific device information to be read
via a sequence of vendor commands. These vendor commands must be issued
in sequence and an atomic fashion. One way to support this would be to
add an ioctl function for sending a sequence of commands to the device
atomically as proposed here. These multi commands are simple array of
the existing mmc_ioc_cmd structure.

The structure passed via the ioctl uses a __u64 type to specify the number
of commands (so that the structure is aligned on a 64-bit boundary) and a
zero length array as a header for list of commands to be issued. The
maximum number of commands that can be sent is determined by
MMC_IOC_MAX_CMDS (which defaults to 255 and should be more than
sufficient).

This based upon work by Seshagiri Holi <sholi@nvidia.com>.
