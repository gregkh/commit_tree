cxlflash: Make functions static

Found during code inspection, that the following functions are not
being used outside of the file where they are defined. Make them static.

int cxlflash_send_cmd(struct afu *, struct afu_cmd *);
void cxlflash_wait_resp(struct afu *, struct afu_cmd *);
int cxlflash_afu_reset(struct cxlflash_cfg *);
struct afu_cmd *cxlflash_cmd_checkout(struct afu *);
void cxlflash_cmd_checkin(struct afu_cmd *);
void init_pcr(struct cxlflash_cfg *);
int init_global(struct cxlflash_cfg *);
