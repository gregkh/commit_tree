drm/radeon: refactor register check loop

After this patch the register check loop does the same thing as before,
except that now gcc does better job optimizing it: it now sees that
end_reg was already checked against PACKET3_SET_CONTEXT_REG_END and can
optimize REG_SAFE_BM_SIZE comparison out of evergreen_is_safe_reg()
as (PACKET3_SET_CONTEXT_REG_END >> 7) < REG_SAFE_BM_SIZE.
