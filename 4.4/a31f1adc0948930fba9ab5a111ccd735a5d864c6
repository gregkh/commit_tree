netfilter: nf_conntrack: Add a struct net parameter to l4_pkt_to_tuple

As gre does not have the srckey in the packet gre_pkt_to_tuple
needs to perform a lookup in it's per network namespace tables.

Pass in the proper network namespace to all pkt_to_tuple
implementations to ensure gre (and any similar protocols) can get this
right.
