packet: do skb_probe_transport_header when we actually have data

In tpacket_fill_skb() commit c1aad275b029 ("packet: set transport
header before doing xmit") and later on 40893fd0fd4e ("net: switch
to use skb_probe_transport_header()") was probing for a transport
header on the skb from a ring buffer slot, but at a time, where
the skb has _not even_ been filled with data yet. So that call into
the flow dissector is pretty useless. Lets do it after we've set
up the skb frags.
