fs/mpage.c: forgotten WRITE_SYNC in case of data integrity write

In case of wbc->sync_mode == WB_SYNC_ALL we need to do data integrity
write, thus mark request as WRITE_SYNC.

akpm: afaict this change will cause the data integrity write bios to be
placed onto the second queue in cfq_io_cq.cfqq[], which presumably results
in special treatment.  The documentation for REQ_SYNC is horrid.
