staging/rdma/hfi1: Add coalescing support for SDMA TX descriptors

This fixes transmit errors when the number of scatter gather elements in the
request is more that the number of per packet descriptors supported by the
hardware, allocate and coalesce the extra scatter gather elements into a single
buffer. The last descriptor is reserved and used for this coalesced buffer.

Verbs potentially need this support when transferring small data chunks
involving different memory regions.
