ASoC: sun4i-codec: Remove the routing property

Most of the boards have their headphone jack directly connected to the
matching pins of the SoCs. Since most of the time we will have the same
routing path, it makes no sense to put that in the DTS, since it will only
be some useless duplication there.

It also fixes the following warning messages that were seen so far, on
boards where we were using the bindings in the documentation example.

sun4i-codec 1c22c00.codec: ASoC: no sink widget found for Headphone Jack
sun4i-codec 1c22c00.codec: ASoC: Failed to add route HP Left -> direct -> Headphone Jack
sun4i-codec 1c22c00.codec: ASoC: no sink widget found for Headphone Jack
sun4i-codec 1c22c00.codec: ASoC: Failed to add route HP Right -> direct -> Headphone Jack
