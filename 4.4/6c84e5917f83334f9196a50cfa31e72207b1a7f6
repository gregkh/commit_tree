ASoC: soc-core: Fix sparse warning in be32_to_cpup() call

Store return value of of_get_property() to a pointer of __be32 type as
device tree has big endian type. This fixes a sparse warning couple of
lines later when be32_to_cpup() is used to convert from big endian to
cpu endian.

The whole conversion is not really necessary, as we are only checking
if the value is zero or not, but I wanted to add it to remind in the
future that the data has to be converted before use. Compiler should
optimize the unnecessary operations away.
