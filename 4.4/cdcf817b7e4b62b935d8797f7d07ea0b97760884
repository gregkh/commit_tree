arm64: Move mixed endian support detection

Move the mixed endian support detection code to cpufeature.c
from cpuinfo.c. This also moves the update_cpu_features()
used by mixed endian detection code, which will get more
functionality.

Also moves the ID register field shifts to asm/sysreg.h,
where all the useful definitions will end up in later patches.
