tipc: introduce jumbo frame support for broadcast

Until now, we have only been supporting a fix MTU size of 1500 bytes
for all broadcast media, irrespective of their actual capability.

We now make the broadcast MTU adaptable to the carrying media, i.e.,
we use the smallest MTU supported by any of the interfaces attached
to TIPC.
