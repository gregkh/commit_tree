mm/page_alloc.c: skip ZONE_MOVABLE if required_kernelcore is larger than totalpages

If kernelcore was not specified, or the kernelcore size is zero
(required_movablecore >= totalpages), or the kernelcore size is larger
than totalpages, there is no ZONE_MOVABLE.  We should fill the zone with
both kernel memory and movable memory.
