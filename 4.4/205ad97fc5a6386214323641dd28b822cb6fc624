ACPI / property: Fix subnode lookup scope for data-only subnodes

The correct scope for looking up the objects to generate data packages for
data-only subnodes pointed to by another data-only subnode is the scope
of the parent of that subnode and not the scope containing the _DSD object
at the top of the hierarchy (the latter works only if all of the objects
returning data-only subnode packages in a given hierarchy are in the same
scope).

Fix the code to work as expected.
