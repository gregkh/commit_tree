ACPI: Use correct IRQ when uninstalling ACPI interrupt handler

Currently when the system is trying to uninstall the ACPI interrupt
handler, it uses acpi_gbl_FADT.sci_interrupt as the IRQ number.
However, the IRQ number that the ACPI interrupt handled is installed
for comes from acpi_gsi_to_irq() and that is the number that should
be used for the handler removal.

Fix this problem by using the mapped IRQ returned from acpi_gsi_to_irq()
as appropriate.
