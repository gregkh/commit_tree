ALSA: firewire-lib: add an argument for Dice's dual wire mode

In IEC 61883-6, one data block represents one event. In ALSA, the event is
one PCM frame. Therefore, when processing one data block, current
implementation counts one PCM frame.

On the other hand, Dice platform has a quirk called as 'dual wire' at
higher sampling rate. In detail, see comment of commit 6eb6c81eee2a
("ALSA: dice: Split stream functionality into a file").

Currently, to handle this quirk, AMDTP stream structure has a
'double_pcm_frames' member. When this is enabled, two PCM frames are
counted. Each driver set this flag by accessing the structure member
directly.

In future commit, some members related to AM824 data block will be moved
to specific structure, to separate packet streaming layer and data block
processing layer. The access will be limited by opaque pointer.

For this reason, this commit adds an argument into
amdtp_stream_set_parameter() to set the flag.
