drm/i915: Remove unnecessary gen8_clamp_pd

gen8_clamp_pd clamps to the next page directory boundary, but the macro
gen8_for_each_pde already has a check to stop at the page directory
boundary.

Furthermore, i915_pte_count also restricts to the next page table
boundary.

v2: Rebase after Mika's ppgtt cleanup / scratch merge patch series.
