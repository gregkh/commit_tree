i2c: rcar: init new messages in irq

Setting up new messages was done in process context while handling a
message was in interrupt context. Because of the HW design, this IP core
is sensitive to timing, so the context switches were too expensive. Move
this setup to interrupt context as well.

In my test setup, this fixed the occasional 'data byte sent twice' issue
which a number of people have seen. It also fixes to send REP_START
after a read message which was wrongly send as a STOP + START sequence
before.
