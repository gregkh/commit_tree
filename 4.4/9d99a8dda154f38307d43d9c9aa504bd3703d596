nvme: move hardware structures out of the uapi version of nvme.h

Currently all NVMe command and completion structures are exposed to userspace
through the uapi version of nvme.h.  They are not an ABI between the kernel
and userspace, and will change in C-incompatible way for future versions of
the spec.  Move them to the kernel version of the file and rename the uapi
header to nvme_ioctl.h so that userspace can easily detect the presence of
the new clean header.  Nvme-cli already carries a local copy of the header,
so it won't be affected by this move.
