drm/i915: Integrate GuC-based command submission

GuC-based submission is mostly the same as execlist mode, up to
intel_logical_ring_advance_and_submit(), where the context being
dispatched would be added to the execlist queue; at this point
we submit the context to the GuC backend instead.

There are, however, a few other changes also required, notably:
1.  Contexts must be pinned at GGTT addresses accessible by the GuC
    i.e. NOT in the range [0..WOPCM_SIZE), so we have to add the
    PIN_OFFSET_BIAS flag to the relevant GGTT-pinning calls.

2.  The GuC's TLB must be invalidated after a context is pinned at
    a new GGTT address.

3.  GuC firmware uses the one page before Ring Context as shared data.
    Therefore, whenever driver wants to get base address of LRC, we
    will offset one page for it. LRC_PPHWSP_PN is defined as the page
    number of LRCA.

4.  In the work queue used to pass requests to the GuC, the GuC
    firmware requires the ring-tail-offset to be represented as an
    11-bit value, expressed in QWords. Therefore, the ringbuffer
    size must be reduced to the representable range (4 pages).

v2:
    Defer adding #defines until needed [Chris Wilson]
    Rationalise type declarations [Chris Wilson]

v4:
    Squashed kerneldoc patch into here [Daniel Vetter]

v5:
    Update request->tail in code common to both GuC and execlist modes.
    Add a private version of lr_context_update(), as sharing the
        execlist version leads to race conditions when the CPU and
        the GuC both update TAIL in the context image.
    Conversion of error-captured HWS page to string must account
        for offset from start of object to actual HWS (LRC_PPHWSP_PN).
