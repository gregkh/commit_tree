9p: xattr simplifications

Now that the xattr handler is passed to the xattr handler operations, we
can use the same get and set operations for the user, trusted, and security
xattr namespaces.  In those namespaces, we can access the full attribute
name by "reattaching" the name prefix the vfs has skipped for us.  Add a
xattr_full_name helper to make this obvious in the code.

For the "system.posix_acl_access" and "system.posix_acl_default"
attributes, handler->prefix is the full attribute name; the suffix is the
empty string.
