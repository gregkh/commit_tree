cpufreq: postfix policy directory with the first CPU in related_cpus

The sysfs policy directory is postfixed currently with the CPU number
for which the policy was created, which isn't necessarily the first CPU
in related_cpus mask.

To make it more consistent and predictable, lets postfix the policy with
the first cpu in related-cpus mask.
