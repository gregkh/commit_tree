staging/rdma/hfi1: Allow tuning of SDMA interrupt rate

The SDMA engines were configured to generate progress interrupts every time they
processed N/2 descriptors (where N is the size of the descriptor queue). This
interval was too infrequent, leading to degraded performance.

This commit adds a module parameter, as well as a recommended default, which
allows for the tuning of the interrupt frequency.
