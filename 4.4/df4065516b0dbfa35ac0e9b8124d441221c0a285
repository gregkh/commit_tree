memcg: simplify and inline __mem_cgroup_from_kmem

Before the previous patch ("memcg: unify slab and other kmem pages
charging"), __mem_cgroup_from_kmem had to handle two types of kmem - slab
pages and pages allocated with alloc_kmem_pages - memcg in the page
struct.  Now we can unify it.  Since after it, this function becomes tiny
we can fold it into mem_cgroup_from_kmem.
