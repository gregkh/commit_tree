usb: dwc2: gadget: only reset core after addressed state

There is a 200ms guard period to avoid unnecessary resets of the dwc2
ip. This delay sometimes prove to be too large when usbcv is run with
an ehci host. dwc2 only needs to be reset after addressed state.
Change the logic to reset ip after addressed state.
