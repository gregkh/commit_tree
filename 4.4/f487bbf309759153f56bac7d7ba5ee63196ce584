pinctrl: intel: Fix compilation warning when !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP

We get following warning when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not set

  warning: â€˜intel_gpio_irq_initâ€™ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

Since the function is only called from intel_pinctrl_resume() move it
inside CONFIG_PM_SLEEP guard as well.
