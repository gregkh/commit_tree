misc: mic: MIC COSM bus

The MIC COSM bus allows the co-processor state management (COSM)
functionality to be shared between multiple generations of Intel MIC
products. The COSM driver registers itself on the COSM bus. The base
PCIe drivers implement the bus ops and register COSM devices on the
bus, resulting in the COSM driver being probed with the COSM devices.
COSM bus ops, e.g. start, stop, ready, reset, therefore abstract out
common functionality from its specific implementation for individual
generations of MIC products.
