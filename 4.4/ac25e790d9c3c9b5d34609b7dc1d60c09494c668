s390/flags: fix flag handling

The cpu flags and pt_regs flags fields are each 64 bits in size. A flag can
be set with helper functions like set_cpu_flags().

These functions create a mask using "1U << flag". This doesn't work if flag
is larger than 31, since 1U << 32 == 0.

So fix this in case we ever will have such flag numbers.
