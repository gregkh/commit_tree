drm/nouveau/fb/ramnv50: Script changes for G94 and up

10053c is not even read on some cards, and I have no idea exactly what the
criteria are. Likely NVIDIA pre-scans the VBIOS and in their driver disables
all features that are never used. The practical effect should be the same
as this implementation though.
