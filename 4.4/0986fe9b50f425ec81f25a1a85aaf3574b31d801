ocfs2: fix race between mount and delete node/cluster

There is a race case between mount and delete node/cluster, which will
lead o2hb_thread to malfunctioning dead loop.

    o2hb_thread
    {
        o2nm_depend_this_node();
        <<<<<< race window, node may have already been deleted, and then
               enter the loop, o2hb thread will be malfunctioning
               because of no configured nodes found.
        while (!kthread_should_stop() &&
               !reg->hr_unclean_stop && !reg->hr_aborted_start) {
    }

So check the return value of o2nm_depend_this_node() is needed.  If node
has been deleted, do not enter the loop and let mount fail.
