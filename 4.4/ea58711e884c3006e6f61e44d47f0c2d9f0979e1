f2fs: do in batches truncation in truncate_hole

truncate_data_blocks_range can do in batches truncation which makes all
changes in dnode page content, dnode page status, extent cache, block
count updating together.

But previously, truncate_hole() always truncates one block in dnode page
at a time by invoking truncate_data_blocks_range(,1), which make thing
slow.

This patch changes truncate_hole() to do in batches truncation for all
target blocks in one direct node inside truncate_data_blocks_range, which
can make our punch hole operation in ->fallocate more efficent.
