perf buildid-list: Requires ordered events

'perf buildid-list' processes events to determine hits (i.e. with-hits
option).  That may not work if events are not sorted in order. i.e. MMAP
events must be processed before the samples that depend on them so that
sample processing can 'hit' the DSO to which the MMAP refers.
