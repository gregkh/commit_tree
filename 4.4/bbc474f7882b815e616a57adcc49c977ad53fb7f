usb: gadget: f_rndis: eliminate abuse of ep->driver data

Since ep->driver_data is not used for endpoint claiming, neither for
enabled/disabled state storing, we can reduce number of places where
we read or modify it's value, as now it has no particular meaning for
function or framework logic.

In case of f_rndis, ep->driver_data was used only for endpoint claiming
and marking endpoints as enabled, so we can simplify code by reducing
it.
