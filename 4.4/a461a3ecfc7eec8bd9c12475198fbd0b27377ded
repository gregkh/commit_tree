ARM: nomadik: set latencies to 8 cycles

The Nomadik has sporadic crashes because of these latencies, setting
them to max makes the platform work nicely, so use this values for
now.

These latencies were set to 2 since the Nomadik platform was merged,
but I suspect they never took effect until the right size and
associativity for the cache was specified in the device tree and
that is why the crash comes now.
