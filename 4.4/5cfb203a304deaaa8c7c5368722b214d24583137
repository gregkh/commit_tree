modpost: abort if a module symbol is too long

Module symbols have a limited length, but currently the build system
allows the build finishing even if the driver code contains a too long
symbol name, which eventually overflows the modversion_info[] item.
The compiler may catch at compiling *.mod.c like
  CC      xxx.mod.o
  xxx.mod.c:18:16: warning: initializer-string for array of chars is too long
but it's merely a warning.

This patch adds the check of the symbol length in modpost and stops
the build properly.

Currently MODULE_NAME_LEN is defined in modpost.c instead of referring
to the definition in kernel header because including linux/module.h is
messy and we must cover cross-compilation.
