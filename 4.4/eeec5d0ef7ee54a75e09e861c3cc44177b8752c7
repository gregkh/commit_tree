rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix lockups on boot

In commit 54328e64047a5 ("rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix system lockups on boot"),
an attempt was made to fix a regression introduced in commit 1277fa2ab2f9
("rtlwifi: Remove the clear interrupt routine from all drivers").
Unfortunately, there were logic errors in that patch that prevented
affected boxes from booting even after that patch was applied.

The actual cause of the original problem is unknown as none of the
developers have systems that are affected.
