Revert "ARM: dts: twl4030: Add iio properties for bci subnode"

This reverts commit af19161aaed7ff8d1a52b2e517460f2fa0774e32,
which breaks the omap3 device tree build due to a wrong reference.

I accidently queued this change via the power supply subsystem while
telling Marek at the same time, that it should go through Tony.
Following that I did miss Stephen's messages about the build failure in
linux-next and since he switched to merging an older snapshot nobody
else noticed the problem in my tree. I didn't notice myself, since I
did not build any device tree files assuming none have changed by me.
