irqchip/gic: Add save/restore of the active state

When using EOImode==1, we may mark interrupts as being forwarded
to a virtual machine. In that case, the interrupt is left active
while being passed to the VM.

If we suspend the system before the VM has deactivated the interrupt,
the active state will be lost (which may be very annoying, as this
may result in spurious interrupts and a confused guest).

To avoid this, save and restore the active state together with the
rest of the GIC registers.
