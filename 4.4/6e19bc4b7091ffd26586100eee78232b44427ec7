nl80211: allow BSS data to include CLOCK_BOOTTIME timestamp

For location and connectivity services, userspace would often like
to know the time when the BSS was last seen. The current "last seen"
value is calculated in a way that makes it less useful, especially
if the system suspended in the meantime.

Add the ability for the driver to report a real CLOCK_BOOTTIME stamp
that can then be reported to userspace (if present).

Drivers wishing to use this must be converted to the new API to call
cfg80211_inform_bss_data() or cfg80211_inform_bss_frame_data(). They
need to ensure the reported value is accurate enough even when the
frame might have been buffered in the device (e.g. firmware.)
