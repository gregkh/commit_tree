mailbox: Add support for ST's Mailbox IP

ST's platforms currently support a maximum of 5 Mailboxes, one for
each of the supported co-processors situated on the platform.  Each
Mailbox is divided up into 4 instances which consist of 32 channels.
Messages are passed between the application and co-processors using
shared memory areas.  It is the Client's responsibility to manage
these areas.
