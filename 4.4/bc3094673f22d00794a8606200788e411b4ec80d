btrfs: extend balance filter usage to take minimum and maximum

Similar to the 'limit' filter, we can enhance the 'usage' filter to
accept a range. The change is backward compatible, the range is applied
only in connection with the BTRFS_BALANCE_ARGS_USAGE_RANGE flag.

We don't have a usecase yet, the current syntax has been sufficient. The
enhancement should provide parity with other range-like filters.
