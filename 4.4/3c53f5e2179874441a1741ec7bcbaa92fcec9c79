clk: qcom: gdsc: Add support for ON only state

Certain devices can have GDSCs' which support ON as the only state.
They can't be power collapsed to either hit RET or OFF.
The clients drivers for these GDSCs' however would expect the state
of the core to be reset following a GDSC disable and re-enable.
To do this assert/deassert reset lines every time the client
driver would request the GDSC to be powered on/off instead.
