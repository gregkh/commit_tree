KVM: nVMX: expose VPID capability to L1

Expose VPID capability to L1. For nested guests, we don't do anything
specific for single context invalidation. Hence, only advertise support
for global context invalidation. The major benefit of nested VPID comes
from having separate vpids when switching between L1 and L2, and also
when L2's vCPUs not sched in/out on L1.
