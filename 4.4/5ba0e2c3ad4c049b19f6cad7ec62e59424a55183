[media] use v4l2_get_timestamp where possible

This is a preparation for a change to the type of v4l2 timestamps.
v4l2_get_timestamp() is a helper function that reads the monotonic
time and stores it into a 'struct timeval'. Multiple drivers implement
the same thing themselves for historic reasons.

Changing them all to use v4l2_get_timestamp() is more consistent
and reduces the amount of code duplication, and most importantly
simplifies the following changes.
