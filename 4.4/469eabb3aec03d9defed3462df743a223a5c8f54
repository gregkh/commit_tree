ata: pata_macio: Fix module autoload for OF platform driver

This platform driver has a OF device ID table but the OF module
alias information is not created so module autoloading won't work.

This patch adds the missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() for OF to export
that information so modules have the correct aliases built-in and
autoloading works correctly.
