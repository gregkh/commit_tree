net: rename SOCK_ASYNC_NOSPACE and SOCK_ASYNC_WAITDATA

This patch is a cleanup to make following patch easier to
review.

Goal is to move SOCK_ASYNC_NOSPACE and SOCK_ASYNC_WAITDATA
from (struct socket)->flags to a (struct socket_wq)->flags
to benefit from RCU protection in sock_wake_async()

To ease backports, we rename both constants.

Two new helpers, sk_set_bit(int nr, struct sock *sk)
and sk_clear_bit(int net, struct sock *sk) are added so that
following patch can change their implementation.
