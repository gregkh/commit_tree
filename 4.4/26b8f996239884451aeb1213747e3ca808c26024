ARCv2: smp: [plat-*]: No need to explicitly call mcip_init_early_smp()

MCIP now registers it's own probe callback with smp_ops.init_early_smp()
which is called by ARC common code, so no need for platforms to do that.

This decouples the platforms and MCIP and helps confine MCIP details
to it's own file.
