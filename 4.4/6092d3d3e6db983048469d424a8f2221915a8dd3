kvm: svm: Only propagate next_rip when guest supports it

Currently we always write the next_rip of the shadow vmcb to
the guests vmcb when we emulate a vmexit. This could confuse
the guest when its cpuid indicated no support for the
next_rip feature.

Fix this by only propagating next_rip if the guest actually
supports it.
