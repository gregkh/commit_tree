drm/ast: Initialized data needed to map fbdev memory

Due to a missing initialization there was no way to map fbdev memory.
Thus for example using the Xserver with the fbdev driver failed.
This fix adds initialization for fix.smem_start and fix.smem_len
in the fb_info structure, which fixes this problem.
