scsi: report 'INQUIRY result too short' once per host

Some host adapters (e.g. Hyper-V storvsc) are known for not respecting
the SPC-2/3/4 requirement for 'INQUIRY data (see table ...) shall
contain at least 36 bytes'. As a result we get tons on 'scsi 0:7:1:1:
scsi scan: INQUIRY result too short (5), using 36' messages on
console. This can be problematic for slow consoles. Introduce
short_inquiry flag in struct Scsi_Host to print the message once per
host.
