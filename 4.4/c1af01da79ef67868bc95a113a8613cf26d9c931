staging: lustre: move cfs_ip_addr_* function from kernel libcfs to LNet

Both of cfs_ip_addr_parse and cfs_ip_addr_match which are located in
libcfs kernel module are used only for LNet so move this into the
nidstring handling code where it belongs. Also create user land
versions of these functions in the libcfs user land library.
