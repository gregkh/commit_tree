IB/qib: Minor fixes to qib per SFF 8636

Minor errors found via code inspection during future development.
SFF 8636 defines bit position 2 to hold the status indication of
QSFP memory paging. The mask used to test for the value was
incorrect and is fixed in this patch. Additionally, the dump
function had a mismatch between the field being printed out and
the field used to source the data which was fixed.
