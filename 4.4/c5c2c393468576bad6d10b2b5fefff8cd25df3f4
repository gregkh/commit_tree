KVM: s390: SCA must not cross page boundaries

We seemed to have missed a few corner cases in commit f6c137ff00a4
("KVM: s390: randomize sca address").

The SCA has a maximum size of 2112 bytes. By setting the sca_offset to
some unlucky numbers, we exceed the page.

0x7c0 (1984) -> Fits exactly
0x7d0 (2000) -> 16 bytes out
0x7e0 (2016) -> 32 bytes out
0x7f0 (2032) -> 48 bytes out

One VCPU entry is 32 bytes long.

For the last two cases, we actually write data to the other page.
1. The address of the VCPU.
2. Injection/delivery/clearing of SIGP externall calls via SIGP IF.

Especially the 2. happens regularly. So this could produce two problems:
1. The guest losing/getting external calls.
2. Random memory overwrites in the host.

So this problem happens on every 127 + 128 created VM with 64 VCPUs.
