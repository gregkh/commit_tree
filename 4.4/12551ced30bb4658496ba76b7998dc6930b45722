ath10k: fix the currently supported QCA9377 target version name

When introducing the original QCA9377 support, the chip target
version was wrongly picked. The chip advertising itself with
bmi target value equal to 0x05020001 is in fact a 1.1 revision.
I realized this once I got a real 1.1 hw to play with.
