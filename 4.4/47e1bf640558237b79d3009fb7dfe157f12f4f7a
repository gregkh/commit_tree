xfs: invalidate cached acl if set via ioctl

Setting or removing the "SGI_ACL_[FILE|DEFAULT]" attributes via the
XFS_IOC_ATTRMULTI_BY_HANDLE ioctl completely bypasses the POSIX ACL
infrastructure, like setting the "trusted.SGI_ACL_[FILE|DEFAULT]" xattrs
did until commit 6caa1056.  Similar to that commit, invalidate cached
acls when setting/removing them via the ioctl as well.
