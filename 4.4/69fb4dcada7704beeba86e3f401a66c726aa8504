power: Add an axp20x-usb-power driver

This adds a driver for the usb power_supply bits of the axp20x PMICs.

I initially started writing my own driver, before coming aware of
Bruno Prémont's excellent earlier RFC with a driver for this.

My driver was lacking CURRENT_MAX and VOLTAGE_MIN support Bruno's
drvier has, so I've copied the code for those from his driver.

Note that the AC-power-supply and battery charger bits will need separate
drivers. Each one needs its own devictree child-node so that other
devicetree nodes can reference the right power-supply, and thus each one
will get its own mfd-cell / platform_device and platform-driver.
