ARC: boot: Support Halt-on-reset and Run-on-reset SMP booting modes

For Run-on-reset, non masters need to spin wait. For Halt-on-reset they
can jump to entry point directly.

Also while at it, made reset vector handler as "the" entry point for
kernel including host debugger based boot (which uses the ELF header
entry point)
