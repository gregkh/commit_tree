net_sched: make qdisc_tree_decrease_qlen() work for non mq

Stas Nichiporovich reported a regression in his HFSC qdisc setup
on a non multi queue device.

It turns out I mistakenly added a TCQ_F_NOPARENT flag on all qdisc
allocated in qdisc_create() for non multi queue devices, which was
rather buggy. I was clearly mislead by the TCQ_F_ONETXQUEUE that is
also set here for no good reason, since it only matters for the root
qdisc.
