of/pci: Add of_pci_check_probe_only to parse "linux,pci-probe-only"

Both pci-host-generic and Pseries parse the "linux,pci-probe-only" property
to engage the PCI_PROBE_ONLY mode, and both have a subtle bug that can be
triggered if the property has no parameter.

Provide a generic, safe implementation that can be used by both.
