sched/core: Check tgid in is_global_init()

Our global init task can have sub-threads, so ->pid check is not reliable
enough for is_global_init(), we need to check tgid instead. This has been
spotted by Oleg and a fix was proposed by Richard a long time ago (see the
link below).

  : Just look at oom_unkillable_task(). It tries to not kill init. But, say,
  : select_bad_process() can happily find a sub-thread of is_global_init()
  : and still kill it.

I recently hit the problem in question; re-sending the patch (to the
best of my knowledge it has never been submitted) with updated function
comment. Credit goes to Oleg and Richard.
