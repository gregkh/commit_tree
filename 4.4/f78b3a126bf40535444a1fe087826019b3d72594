ARM: pxa: magician: Rename charger cable detection EGPIOs

This patch renames EGPIOs, which are used for the charging cable presence
and type detection. Old names did not correspond with an observed
functionality (on board_id 0x3a). The behavior is not:

- AC charger
- USB charger
- Cable detection

, but:

- AC/USB type
- Cable detection1
- Cable detection2

This patch fixes a possible typo in the bit offset for the cable detection
EGPIO declaration, too.
