PM / Domains: Don't measure ->start|stop() latency in system PM callbacks

Measure latency does by itself contribute to an increased latency, thus we
should avoid it when it isn't needed.

Genpd measures latencies in the system PM phase for the ->start|stop()
callbacks and is thus affecting the system PM suspend/resume time.
Moreover these latencies are validated only at runtime PM suspend/resume.

To this reasoning, let's decide to leave these measurements out of the
system PM phase. There should be plenty of occasions during runtime PM to
perform these measurements anyway.
