ALSA: dice: fix detection of Loud devices

Commit a471fcde8c2c ("ALSA: dice: fix detection of Weiss devices") adds
a quirk of Weiss models. According to users' reports, Loud models also
have the similar quirk. They have 0x10 in the category field.

This commit adds support for Mackie Onyx Blackbird and Onyx-i series.
As long as I know, Dice-based models produced by
Focusrite/Alesis/PreSonus/M-Audio/TC Electronic have default value (0x04)
in their category field, thus it may be reasonable to add a condition
statement for Loud models, instead of removing the check of category value.
