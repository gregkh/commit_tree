mac80211: do not actively scan DFS channels

DFS channels should not be actively scanned as we can't be sure
if we are allowed or not.

If the current channel is in the DFS band, active scan might be
performed after CSA, but we have no guarantee about other channels,
therefore it is safer to prevent active scanning at all.
