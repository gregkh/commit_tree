cxlflash: Fix host link up event handling

Following a link up event, the LUNs available to the host may
have changed. Without rescanning the host, the LUN topology is
unknown to the user. In such a state, the user would be unable
to locate provisioned resources.

To remedy, the host should be rescanned after a link up event.
