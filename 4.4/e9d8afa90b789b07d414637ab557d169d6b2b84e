bpf: consolidate bpf_prog_put{, _rcu} dismantle paths

We currently have duplicated cleanup code in bpf_prog_put() and
bpf_prog_put_rcu() cleanup paths. Back then we decided that it was
not worth it to make it a common helper called by both, but with
the recent addition of resource charging, we could have avoided
the fix in commit ac00737f4e81 ("bpf: Need to call bpf_prog_uncharge_memlock
from bpf_prog_put") if we would have had only a single, common path.
We can simplify it further by assigning aux->prog only once during
allocation time.
