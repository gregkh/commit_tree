debugfs: Add read-only/write-only size_t file ops

There aren't any read-only or write-only size_t file ops, but there
is a caller of debugfs_create_size_t() that calls it with mode
equal to 0400. This leads to the possibility of userspace
modifying the file, so let's use the newly created
debugfs_create_mode() helper here to fix this.
