ALSA: hda - Add api_version to hda_device_id struct

For distinguishing the difference between HDA legacy and ext codec
driver entries, we need to expose the value corresponding to type
field.  This patch adds a new field, api_version, to hda_device_id
struct, so that this information is embedded in modalias string.

Although the information is basically redundant (struct hdac_device
already has type field), the helper that extracts from
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() won't take it account except for the exported
table entries themselves.  So we need to put the same information in
the table, too.
