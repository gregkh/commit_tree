ver_linux: loadkeys, look for numerical input, not field number

'loadkeys -h' no longer prints the version number across all distros,
despite the claim to do so in the manpage, which I found to be the case
on a Debian Linux system.

The proposed implementation utilises the output of 'loadkeys -V' to
acquire the version of both 'Kbd' and 'Console-tools'.

Tested on:
Gentoo Linux
Debian 6.0.10
Oracle Linux Server release 7.1

Rely on regex to find the version number, rather than rely on numerical input to be found in a particular input field.
