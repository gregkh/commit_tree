mac80211: allow writing TX PN in debugfs

For certain tests, for example replay detection, it can be useful
to be able to influence/set the PN used in outgoing packets. Make
it possible to change the TX PN in debugfs.

For now, this doesn't support TKIP since I haven't needed it, but
there's no reason it couldn't be added if necessary.

Note that this must be used very carefully: it could, for example,
be used to make "valid replays" where the PN reuse happens on a
different TID. This couldn't be done by an attacker since the TID
is protected as part of the AAD.
