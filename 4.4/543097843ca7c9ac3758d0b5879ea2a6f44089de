arm64: build vdso without libgcov

On a cross-toolchain without glibc support, libgcov may not be
available, and attempting to build an arm64 kernel with GCOV
enabled then results in a build error:

/home/arnd/cross-gcc/lib/gcc/aarch64-linux/5.2.1/../../../../aarch64-linux/bin/ld: cannot find -lgcov

We don't really want to link libgcov into the vdso anyway, so
this patch just disables GCOV in the vdso directory, just as
we do for most other architectures.
