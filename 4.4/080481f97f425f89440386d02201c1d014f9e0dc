irqchip: armada-370-xp: Rework per-cpu interrupts handling

The MPIC driver currently has a list of interrupts to handle as per-cpu.

Since the timer, fabric and neta interrupts were the only per-cpu
interrupts in the system, we can now remove the switch and just check for
the hardware irq number to determine whether a given interrupt is per-cpu
or not.
