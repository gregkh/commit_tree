arm64: mm: fix fault_info table xFSC decoding

We are missing descriptions for some valid xFSC values in the fault info
table (e.g. "TLB conflict abort"), and have erroneous descriptions for
reserved values (e.g. "asynchronous external abort", "debug event").

This patch adds the missing xFSC values, and removes erroneous decoding
of values reserved by the architecture, as described in ARM DDI 0487A.h.

At the same time, fixed the unbalanced brackets for the synchronous
parity error strings in the table.
