arm64: kasan: fix issues reported by sparse

Sparse reports some new issues introduced by the kasan patches:

  arch/arm64/mm/kasan_init.c:91:13: warning: no previous prototype for
  'kasan_early_init' [-Wmissing-prototypes] void __init kasan_early_init(void)
             ^
  arch/arm64/mm/kasan_init.c:91:13: warning: symbol 'kasan_early_init'
  was not declared. Should it be static? [sparse]

This patch resolves the problem by adding a prototype for
kasan_early_init and marking the function as asmlinkage, since it's only
called from head.S.
