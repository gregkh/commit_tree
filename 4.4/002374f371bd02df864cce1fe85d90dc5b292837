MIPS: KVM: Fix ASID restoration logic

ASID restoration on guest resume should determine the guest execution
mode based on the guest Status register rather than bit 30 of the guest
PC.

Fix the two places in locore.S that do this, loading the guest status
from the cop0 area. Note, this assembly is specific to the trap &
emulate implementation of KVM, so it doesn't need to check the
supervisor bit as that mode is not implemented in the guest.
