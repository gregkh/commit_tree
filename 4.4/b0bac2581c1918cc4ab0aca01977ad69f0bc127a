usb: gadget: introduce 'enabled' flag in struct usb_ep

This patch introduces 'enabled' flag in struct usb_ep, and modifies
usb_ep_enable() and usb_ep_disable() functions to encapsulate endpoint
enabled/disabled state. It helps to avoid enabling endpoints which are
already enabled, and disabling endpoints which are already disables.

From now USB functions don't have to remember current endpoint
enable/disable state, as this state is now handled automatically which
makes this API less bug-prone.
