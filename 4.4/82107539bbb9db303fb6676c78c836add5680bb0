virtio: Do not drop __GFP_HIGH in alloc_indirect

b92b1b89a33c ("virtio: force vring descriptors to be allocated from
lowmem") tried to exclude highmem pages for descriptors so it cleared
__GFP_HIGHMEM from a given gfp mask. The patch also cleared __GFP_HIGH
which doesn't make much sense for this fix because __GFP_HIGH only
controls access to memory reserves and it doesn't have any influence
on the zone selection. Some of the call paths use GFP_ATOMIC and
dropping __GFP_HIGH will reduce their changes for success because the
lack of access to memory reserves.
