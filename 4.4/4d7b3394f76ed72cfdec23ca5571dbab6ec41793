mm/oom_kill: fix the wrong task->mm == mm checks in oom_kill_process()

Both "child->mm == mm" and "p->mm != mm" checks in oom_kill_process() are
wrong.  task->mm can be NULL if the task is the exited group leader.  This
means in particular that "kill sharing same memory" loop can miss a
process with a zombie leader which uses the same ->mm.

Note: the process_has_mm(child, p->mm) check is still not 100% correct,
p->mm can be NULL too.  This is minor, but probably deserves a fix or a
comment anyway.
