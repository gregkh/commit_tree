qmi_wwan: fix entry for HP lt4112 LTE/HSPA+ Gobi 4G Module

The lt4112 is a HP branded Huawei me906e modem. Like other Huawei
modems, it does not have a fixed interface to function mapping.
Instead it uses a Huawei specific scheme: functions are mapped by
subclass and protocol.

However, the HP vendor ID is used for modems from many different
manufacturers using different schemes, so we cannot apply a generic
vendor rule like we do for the Huawei vendor ID.

Replace the previous lt4112 entry pointing to an arbitrary interface
number with a device specific subclass + protocol match.
