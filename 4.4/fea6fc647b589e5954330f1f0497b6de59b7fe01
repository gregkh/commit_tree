Staging: lustre: lproc_osc: Change the variable to be checked

The variable rc is supposed to hold the value returned by function
kstrtoul which can either be 0, -EINVAL (-22) or -ERANGE (-34).
Therefore, the check must be performed on rc instead of val for error
values. Also, rc can never be greater than 0.
