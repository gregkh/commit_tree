x86/efi-bgrt: Switch pr_err() to pr_debug() for invalid BGRT

It's totally legitimate, per the ACPI spec, for the firmware to
set the BGRT 'status' field to zero to indicate that the BGRT
image isn't being displayed, and we shouldn't be printing an
error message in that case because it's just noise for users. So
swap pr_err() for pr_debug().

However, Josh points that out it still makes sense to test the
validity of the upper 7 bits of the 'status' field, since
they're marked as "reserved" in the spec and must be zero. If
firmware violates this it really *is* an error.
