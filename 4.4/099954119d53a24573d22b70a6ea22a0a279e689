md-cluster: send BITMAP_NEEDS_SYNC when node is leaving cluster

Previously, BITMAP_NEEDS_SYNC message is sent when the resyc
aborts, but it could abort for different reasons, and not all
of reasons require another node to take over the resync ownship.

It is better make BITMAP_NEEDS_SYNC message only be sent when
the node is leaving cluster with dirty bitmap. And we also need
to ensure dlm connection is ok.
