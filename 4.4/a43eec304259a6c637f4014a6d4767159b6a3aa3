bpf: introduce bpf_perf_event_output() helper

This helper is used to send raw data from eBPF program into
special PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE/PERF_COUNT_SW_BPF_OUTPUT perf_event.
User space needs to perf_event_open() it (either for one or all cpus) and
store FD into perf_event_array (similar to bpf_perf_event_read() helper)
before eBPF program can send data into it.

Today the programs triggered by kprobe collect the data and either store
it into the maps or print it via bpf_trace_printk() where latter is the debug
facility and not suitable to stream the data. This new helper replaces
such bpf_trace_printk() usage and allows programs to have dedicated
channel into user space for post-processing of the raw data collected.
