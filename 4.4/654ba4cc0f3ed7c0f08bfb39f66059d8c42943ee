fpga manager: ensure lifetime with of_fpga_mgr_get

Ensure device and driver lifetime from of_fpga_mgr_get() to
fpga_mgr_put().

* Don't put_device() in of_fpga_mgr_get, do it in fpga_mgr_put().
  (still do put_device if there is an error).
* Do module_get on the low level driver.
* Don't need to module_get(THIS_MODULE) since we won't be allowed
  to unload the fpga manager core without unloading low level
  driver first.
* Remove unnedessary null check for node pointer.
