Commit 53147b6cabee5e8d1997b5682fcc0c3b72ddf9c2 ("toshiba_acpi: Fix
hotkeys registration on some toshiba models") fixed an issue on some
laptops regarding hotkeys registration, however, if failed to address
the initialization of the hotkey_event_type variable, and thus, it can
lead to potential unwanted effects as the variable is being checked.

This patch initializes such variable to avoid such unwanted effects.
