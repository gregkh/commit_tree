staging: most: add fair buffer distribution

This patch ensures a fair distribution of buffers, when two AIMs share a
single channel. The AIMs then won't be able to use more than half of all
pre-allocated buffers of the linked channel. However, in case the channel
is not shared, the AIM can exclusively use all available buffers.
