clk: rockchip: reset init state before mmc card initialization

mmc host controller's IO input/output timing is unpredictable if
bootloader execute tuning for HS200 mode. It might make kernel failed
to initialize mmc card in identification mode. The root cause is
tuning phase and degree setting for HS200 mode in bootloader aren't
applicable to that of identification mode in kernel stage. Anyway, we
can't force all bootloaders to reset tuning phase and degree setting
before into kernel. Simply reset it in rockchip_clk_register_mmc.
