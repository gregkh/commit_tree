Bluetooth: btbcm: Send HCI Reset before sending Apple specific commands

The commit 7bee8b08c428 allows the Read Verbose Config Info to fail
gracefully and not cause the controller setup to abort. It seems the
reason that command failed in the first place was the missing HCI Reset
to bring the controller in full Bluetooth mode.

Apple Bluetooth controllers start out in HID mode and when in that mode
the Read Verbose Config Info command is not allowed. Sending HCI Reset
switches the controller into full HCI mode.
