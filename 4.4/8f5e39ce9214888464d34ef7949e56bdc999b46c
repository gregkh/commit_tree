i40e/i40evf: refactor IRQ enable function

This change moves a multi-line register setting into a function
which simplifies reading the flow of the enable function.

This also fixes a bug where the enable function was enabling
the interrupt twice while trying to update the two interrupt
throttle rate thresholds for Rx and Tx.
