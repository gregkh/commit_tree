KVM: x86: store IOAPIC-handled vectors in each VCPU

We can reuse the algorithm that computes the EOI exit bitmap to figure
out which vectors are handled by the IOAPIC.  The only difference
between the two is for edge-triggered interrupts other than IRQ8
that have no notifiers active; however, the IOAPIC does not have to
do anything special for these interrupts anyway.

This again limits the interactions between the IOAPIC and the LAPIC,
making it easier to move the former to userspace.

Inspired by a patch from Steve Rutherford.
