mac80211: fixup AIFSN instead of disabling WMM

Disabling WMM has a huge impact these days. It implies that
HT and VHT will be disabled which means that the throughput
will be drammatically reduced.
Since the AIFSN is a transmission parameter, we can play a
bit and fix it up to make it compliant with the 802.11
specification which requires it to be at least 2.
Increasing it from 1 to 2 will slightly reduce the
likelyhood to get a transmission opportunity compared to
other clients that would accept to set AIFSN=1, but at
least it will allow HT and VHT which is a huge gain.
