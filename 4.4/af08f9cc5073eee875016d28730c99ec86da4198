ACPICA: Debugger: Fix "quit/exit" command by cleaning up user commands termination logic

ACPICA commit 0dd68e16274cd38224aa4781eddc57dc2cbaa108

The quit/exit commands shouldn't invoke acpi_terminate_debugger() and
acpi_terminate() right in the user command loop, because when the debugger
exits, the kernel ACPI subsystem shouldn't be terminated (acpi_terminate())
and the debugger should only be terminated by its users
(acpi_terminate_debugger()) rather than being terminated itself. Leaving such
invocations causes kernel panic when the debugger is shipped in the Linux
kernel.

This patch fixes this issue. Lv Zheng.
