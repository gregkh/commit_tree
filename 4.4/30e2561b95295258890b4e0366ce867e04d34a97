i40e: Fix for recursive RTNL lock during PROMISC change

The sync_vsi_filters function can be called directly under RTNL
or through the timer subtask without one. This was causing a deadlock.

If sync_vsi_filters is called from a thread which held the lock,
and in another thread the PROMISC setting got changed we would
be executing the PROMISC change in the thread which already held
the lock alongside the other filter update. The PROMISC change
requires a reset if we are on a VEB, which requires it to be called
under RTNL.

Earlier the driver would call reset for PROMISC change without
checking if we were already under RTNL and would try to grab it
causing a deadlock. This patch changes the flow to see if we are
already under RTNL before trying to grab it.
