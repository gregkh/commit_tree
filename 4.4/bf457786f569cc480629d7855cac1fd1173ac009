arm64/efi: move arm64 specific stub C code to libstub

Now that we added special handling to the C files in libstub, move
the one remaining arm64 specific EFI stub C file to libstub as
well, so that it gets the same treatment. This should prevent future
changes from resulting in binaries that may execute incorrectly in
UEFI context.

With efi-entry.S the only remaining EFI stub source file under
arch/arm64, we can also simplify the Makefile logic somewhat.
