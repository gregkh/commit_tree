IB/addr: Pass network namespace as a parameter

Add network namespace support to the ib_addr module. For that, all the
address resolution and matching should be done using the appropriate
namespace instead of init_net.

This is achieved by:

1. Adding an explicit network namespace argument to exported function that
   require a namespace.
2. Saving the namespace in the rdma_addr_client structure.
3. Using it when calling networking functions.

In order to preserve the behavior of calling modules, &init_net is
passed as the parameter in calls from other modules. This is modified as
namespace support is added on more levels.
