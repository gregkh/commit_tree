mm: page_alloc: remove GFP_IOFS

GFP_IOFS was intended to be shorthand for clearing two flags, not a set of
allocation flags.  There is only one user of this flag combination now and
there appears to be no reason why Lustre had to be protected from reclaim
stalls.  As none of the sites appear to be atomic, this patch simply
deletes GFP_IOFS and converts Lustre to using GFP_KERNEL, GFP_NOFS or
GFP_NOIO as appropriate.
