dmaengine: dw: some Intel devices has no memcpy support

Provide a flag to choose if the device does support memory-to-memory transfers.
At least this is not true for iDMA32 controller that might be supported in the
future. Besides that Intel BayTrail and Braswell users should not try this
feature due to HW specific behaviour.
