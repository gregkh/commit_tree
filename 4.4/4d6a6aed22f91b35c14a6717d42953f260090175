6lowpan: move shared settings to lowpan_netdev_setup

This patch moves values for all lowpan interface to the shared
implementation of 6lowpan. This patch also quietly fixes the forgotten
IFF_NO_QUEUE flag for the bluetooth 6LoWPAN interface. An identically
commit is 4afbc0d ("net: 6lowpan: convert to using IFF_NO_QUEUE") which
wasn't changed for bluetooth 6lowpan.

All 6lowpan interfaces should be virtual with IFF_NO_QUEUE, using EUI64
address length, the mtu size is 1280 (IPV6_MIN_MTU) and the netdev type
is ARPHRD_6LOWPAN.
