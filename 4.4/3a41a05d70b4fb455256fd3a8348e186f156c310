drm/i915/gtt: Avoid calling kcalloc in a loop when allocating temp bitmaps

On each call to gen8_alloc_va_range_3lvl we're allocating temporary
bitmaps needed for error handling. Unfortunately, when we increase
address space size (48b ppgtt) we do additional (512 - 4) calls to
kcalloc, increasing latency between exec and actual start of execution
on the GPU. Let's just do a single kcalloc, we can also drop the size
from free_gen8_temp_bitmaps since it's no longer used.

v2: Use GFP_TEMPORARY to make the allocations reclaimable.
v3: Drop the 2D array, just allocate a single block.
v4: Rebase to handle gen8_preallocate_top_level_pdps.
v5: Align misaligned bracket.
