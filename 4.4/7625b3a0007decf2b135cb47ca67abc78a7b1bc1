kernel/panic.c: turn off locks debug before releasing console lock

Commit 08d78658f393 ("panic: release stale console lock to always get the
logbuf printed out") introduced an unwanted bad unlock balance report when
panic() is called directly and not from OOPS (e.g.  from out_of_memory()).
The difference is that in case of OOPS we disable locks debug in
oops_enter() and on direct panic call nobody does that.

Fixes: 08d78658f393 ("panic: release stale console lock to always get the logbuf printed out")
