dmaengine: hdmac: Add scatter-gathered memset support

Just like memset support, the HDMAC might be used to do a memset over a
discontiguous memory area.

In such a case, we'll just build up a chain of memset descriptors over the
contiguous chunks of memory to set, in order to allow such a support.
