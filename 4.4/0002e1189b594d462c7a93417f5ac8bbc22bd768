i40e: Never let speed get set to 0 in get_settings

In ethtool, there is a possibility of speed getting set to 0
if advertise is set to 0 (which it is when autoneg is disabled).
We never want this to happen as the firmware will actually attempt
to set the speed to 0 sending link down, so add an extra check
to make sure this doesn't happen.
