powerpc/eeh: Fix recursive fenced PHB on Broadcom shiner adapter

Similar to commit b6541db ("powerpc/eeh: Block PCI config access
upon frozen PE"), this blocks the PCI config space of Broadcom
Shiner adapter until PE reset is completed, to avoid recursive
fenced PHB when dumping PCI config registers during the period
of error recovery.
