misc: mic: Coprocessor State Management (COSM) driver

The COSM driver allows boot, shutdown and reset of Intel MIC devices
via sysfs. This functionality was previously present in the Intel MIC
host driver but has now been taken out into a separate driver so that
it can be shared between multiple generations of Intel MIC products.
The sysfs kernel ABI used by the COSM driver is the same as that
defined originally for the MIC host driver in
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-mic.txt.

The COSM driver also contains support for dumping the MIC card log_buf
and doing a "force reset" for the card via debugfs. The OSPM support
present in the MIC host driver has now largely been moved to user
space and only a small required OSPM functionality is now present in
the driver.
