thermal: exynos: Fix unbalanced regulator disable on probe failure

During probe if the regulator could not be enabled, the error exit path
would still disable it. This could lead to unbalanced counter of
regulator enable/disable.

The patch moves code for getting and enabling the regulator from
exynos_map_dt_data() to probe function because it is really not a part
of getting Device Tree properties.
