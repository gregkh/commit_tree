mtd: spi-nor: add SPI NOR manufacturer IDs

These are often similar for CFI (parallel NOR) and for SPI NOR, but they
aren't always the same, for various reasons (different namespaces,
company acquisitions and renames, etc.). And some don't have CFI_MFR_*
entries at all.

So let's make a proper place to list the SPI NOR IDs, with all the SPI
NOR specific assumptions and comments.
