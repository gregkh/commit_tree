perf report: Skip events with null branch stacks

A non-synthesized event might not have a branch stack if branch stacks
have been synthesized (using itrace options).

An example of that is when Intel PT records sched_switch events for
decoding purposes.  Those sched_switch events do not have branch stacks
even though the Intel PT decoder may be synthesizing other events that
do due to the itrace options.
