tpm, tpm_crb: fix unaligned read of the command buffer address

The command buffer address must be read with exactly two 32-bit reads.
Otherwise, on some HW platforms, it seems that HW will abort the read
operation, which causes CPU to fill the read bytes with 1's. Therefore,
we cannot rely on memcpy_fromio() but must call ioread32() two times
instead.

Also, this matches the PC Client Platform TPM Profile specification,
which defines command buffer address with two 32-bit fields.
