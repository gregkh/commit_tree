ipv6: constify ip6_xmit() sock argument

This is to document that socket lock might not be held at this point.

skb_set_owner_w() and ipv6_local_error() are using proper atomic ops
or spinlocks, so we promote the socket to non const when calling them.

netfilter hooks should never assume socket lock is held,
we also promote the socket to non const.
