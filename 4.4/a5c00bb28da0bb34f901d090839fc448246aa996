drivers: firmware: psci: add extended stateid power_state support

PSCI v1.0 augmented the power_state parameter format specification
(extended stateid) and introduced a way to probe it through the
PSCI_FEATURES interface.

This patch implements code that detects the power_state format at
run-time through the PSCI_FEATURES interface, so that the power_state
argument can be properly detected and validated in the kernel according
to the information provided through firmware.
