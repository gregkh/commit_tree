mac80211: use ktime_get_seconds

The mac80211 code uses ktime_get_ts to measure the connected time.
As this uses monotonic time, it is y2038 safe on 32-bit systems,
but we still want to deprecate the use of 'timespec' because most
other users are broken.

This changes the code to use ktime_get_seconds() instead, which
avoids the timespec structure and is slightly more efficient.
