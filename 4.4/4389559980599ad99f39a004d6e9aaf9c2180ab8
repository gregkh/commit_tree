drm/imx: switch to universal planes

Use drm_universal_plane_init to create the planes, create the primary
plane first and use drm_crtc_init_with_planes to associate it with
the crtc.
This gets rid of the unused fallback primary plane previously created
by drm_crtc_init and fixes a NULL pointer dereference issue that can
be triggered by a modeset from userspace when fbdev helpers are
enabled [1].
