drm/i915: Store max dotclock

Store max dotclock into dev_priv structure so we are able
to filter out the modes that are not supported by our
platforms.

V2:
- limit the max dot clock frequency to max CD clock frequency
  for the gen9 and above
- limit the max dot clock frequency to 90% of the max CD clock
  frequency for the older gens
- for Cherryview the max dot clock frequency is limited to 95%
  of the max CD clock frequency
- for gen2 and gen3 the max dot clock limit is set to 90% of the
  2X max CD clock frequency

V3:
- max_dotclk variable renamed as max_dotclk_freq in i915_drv.h
- in intel_compute_max_dotclk() the rounding method changed from
  round up to round down when computing max dotclock

V4:
- Haswell and Broadwell supports now dot clocks up to max CD clock
  frequency
