s390/dis: Fix handling of format specifiers

The print_insn() function returns strings like "lghi %r1,0". To escape the
'%' character in sprintf() a second '%' is used. For example "lghi %%r1,0"
is converted into "lghi %r1,0".

After print_insn() the output string is passed to printk(). Because format
specifiers like "%r" or "%f" are ignored by printk() this works by chance
most of the time. But for instructions with control registers like
"lctl %c6,%c6,780" this fails because printk() interprets "%c" as
character format specifier.

Fix this problem and escape the '%' characters twice.

For example "lctl %%%%c6,%%%%c6,780" is then converted by sprintf()
into "lctl %%c6,%%c6,780" and by printk() into "lctl %c6,%c6,780".
