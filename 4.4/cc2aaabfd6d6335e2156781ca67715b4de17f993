tty: Remove tty_port::close_wait

With the removal of tty_wait_until_sent_from_close(), tty drivers
no longer wait during open for parallel closes to complete (instead,
the tty core waits before calling the driver open() method). Thus,
the close_wait waitqueue is no longer used for waiting.

Remove struct tty_port::close_wait.
