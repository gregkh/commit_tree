ath9k: fix phyerror codes

Some of the ath9k_phyerr enums were wrong from the
beginning (and even before). Most of the time the
codes were used for counters to be displayed over
debugfs, which made this a non-functional issue.

Some (e.g. ATH9K_PHYERR_FALSE_RADAR_EXT) are used
for radar detection and require the correct code
to work as intended.

This patch includes:
a) fixes
  ATH9K_PHYERR_FALSE_RADAR_EXT:    24 => 36
  ATH9K_PHYERR_CCK_LENGTH_ILLEGAL: 32 => 28
  ATH9K_PHYERR_CCK_POWER_DROP:     33 => 29
  ATH9K_PHYERR_HT_CRC_ERROR:       34 => 32
  ATH9K_PHYERR_HT_LENGTH_ILLEGAL:  35 => 33
  ATH9K_PHYERR_HT_RATE_ILLEGAL:    36 => 34

b) extensions
  ATH9K_PHYERR_CCK_BLOCKER = 24
  ATH9K_PHYERR_HT_ZLF      = 35
  ATH9K_PHYERR_GREEN_FIELD = 37

Aside from the correction and completion made in
the enum, the patch also extends the display of
the related counters in the debugfs.
