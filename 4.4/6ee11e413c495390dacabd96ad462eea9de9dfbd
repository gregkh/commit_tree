Revert "cpufreq: intel_pstate: Use ACPI perf configuration"

Revert commit 37afb0003242 (cpufreq: intel_pstate: Use ACPI perf
configuration) that is reported to cause a regression to happen
on a system where invalid data are returned by the ACPI _PSS object.

Since that commit makes assumptions regarding the _PSS output
correctness that may turn out to be overly optimistic in general,
there is a concern that it may introduce regression on more
systems, so it's better to revert it now and we'll revisit the
underlying issue in the next cycle with a more robust solution.
