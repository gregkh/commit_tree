ARM: dts: sun8i: Make ippo-q8h-v*.dts a symlink to q8-tablet.dts

A23 Q8 tablets with the ippo-q8h-v* pcb will work fine with the
generic q8-tablet.dts and given the many variants of PCBs found in
Q8 tablets using such a specific dts name was a mistake in hindsight.

We cannot just drop the ippo-q8h-v*.dtb as existing u-boot configs
may very well point to it.
