m32r: add io*_rep helpers

m32r allmodconfig was failing with the error:

  error: implicit declaration of function 'read'

On checking io.h it turned out that 'read' is not defined but 'readb' is
defined and 'ioread8' will then obviously mean 'readb'.

At the same time some of the helper functions ioreadN_rep() and
iowriteN_rep() were missing which also led to the build failure.
