ALSA: firewire-lib: rename PCM format helper function

Setting the format of PCM substream to AMDTP stream structure is important
to set a handler to copy actual PCM samples between buffers. The
processing should be in data block processing layer because essentially
it has no relationship to packet streaming.

This commit renames PCM format setting function to prepare for integrating
AM824 layer.
