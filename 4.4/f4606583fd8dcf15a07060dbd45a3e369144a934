ieee802154: 6lowpan: change dev vars to wdev and ldev

Inside the IEEE 802.15.4 6LoWPAN subsystem we use two interfaces which
are wpan and lowpan interfaces. Instead of using always the variable
name "dev" for both we rename the "dev" variable to wdev which means the
wpan net_device and ldev which means a lowpan net_device. This avoids
confusing and always looking back to see which net_device is meant by
the variable name "dev".
