cxlflash: Correct behavior in device reset handler following EEH

When the device reset handler is entered while a reset operation
is taking place, the handler exits without actually sending a
reset (TMF) to the targeted device. This behavior is incorrect
as the device is not reset. Further complicating matters is the
fact that a success is returned even when the TMF was not sent.

To fix, the state is rechecked after coming out of the reset
state. When the state is normal, a TMF will be sent out.
