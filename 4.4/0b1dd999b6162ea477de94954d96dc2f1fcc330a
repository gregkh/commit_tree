drivers/tty: make serial 8250_lpc18xx.c Kconfig a tristate

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

8250/Kconfig:config SERIAL_8250_LPC18XX
8250/Kconfig:        bool "NXP LPC18xx/43xx serial port support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

When targetting orphaned modular code in non-modular drivers, this
came up.  Joachim indicated that the driver was actually meant to
be tristate but ended up bool by accident.  So here we make it
tristate instead of removing the modular code that was essentially
orphaned.
