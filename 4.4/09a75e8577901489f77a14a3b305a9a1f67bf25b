usb: dwc2: refactor common low-level hw code to platform.c

DWC2 module on some platforms needs three additional hardware
resources: phy controller, clock and power supply. All of them must be
enabled/activated to properly initialize and operate. This was initially
handled in s3c-hsotg driver, which has been converted to 'gadget' part
of dwc2 driver. Unfortunately, not all of this code got moved to common
platform code, what resulted in accessing DWC2 registers without
enabling low-level hardware resources. This fails for example on Exynos
SoCs. This patch moves all the code for managing those resources to
common platform.c file and provides convenient wrappers for controlling
them.
