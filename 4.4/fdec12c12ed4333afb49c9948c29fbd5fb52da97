KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Fix kvm_vgic_map_is_active's dist check

External inputs to the vgic from time to time need to poke into the
state of a virtual interrupt, the prime example is the architected timer
code.

Since the IRQ's active state can be represented in two places; the LR or
the distributor, we first loop over the LRs but if not active in the LRs
we just return if *any* IRQ is active on the VCPU in question.

This is of course bogus, as we should check if the specific IRQ in
quesiton is active on the distributor instead.
