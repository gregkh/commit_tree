tty: r3964: Replace/remove bogus tty lock use

The tty lock is strictly for serializing tty lifetime events
(open/close/hangup), and not for line discipline serialization.

The tty core already provides serialization of concurrent writes
to the same tty, and line discipline lifetime management (by ldisc
references), so pinning the tty via tty_lock() is unnecessary and
counter-productive; remove tty lock use.

However, the line discipline is responsible for serializing reads
(if required by the line discipline); add read_lock mutex to
serialize calls of r3964_read().
