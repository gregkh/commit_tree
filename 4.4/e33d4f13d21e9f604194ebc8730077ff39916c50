xfrm: Fix unaligned access to stats in copy_to_user_state()

On sparc, deleting established SAs (e.g., by restarting ipsec)
results in unaligned access messages via xfrm_del_sa ->
km_state_notify -> xfrm_send_state_notify().

Even though struct xfrm_usersa_info is aligned on 8-byte boundaries,
netlink attributes are fundamentally only 4 byte aligned, and this
cannot be changed for nla_data() that is passed up to userspace.
As a result, the put_unaligned() macro needs to be used to
set up potentially unaligned fields such as the xfrm_stats in
copy_to_user_state()
