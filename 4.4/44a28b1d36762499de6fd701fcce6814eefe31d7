drm/i915: Implementation of GuC submission client

A GuC client has its own doorbell and workqueue. It maintains the
doorbell cache line, process description object and work queue item.

A default guc_client is created for the i915 driver to use for
normal-priority in-order submission.

Note that the created client is not yet ready for use; doorbell
allocation will fail as we haven't yet linked the GuC's context
descriptor to the default contexts for each ring (see later patch).

v2:
    Defer adding structure members until needed [Chris Wilson]
    Rationalise type declarations [Chris Wilson]

v5:
    Add GuC per-engine submission & seqno statistics.
    Move wq locking to encompass both get_space() and add_item().
    Take forcewake lock in host2guc_action() [Tom O'Rourke]

v6:
    Fix GuC doorbell cacheline selection code (the
        cacheline-within-page calculation was wrong).
    Rename GuC priorities to make them closer to the names used in
        the GuC firmware source, matching what the autogenerated
        versions will (probably) be.
    Add per-ring statistics to client.
