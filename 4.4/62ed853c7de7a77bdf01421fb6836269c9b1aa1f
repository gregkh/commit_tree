watchdog: w83977f_wdt: underflow in wdt_set_timeout()

"t" is controlled by the user.  If "t" is a very large integer then it
could lead to a negative "tmrval".  We cap the upper bound of "tmrval"
but, in the current code, we allow negatives.  This is a bug and it
causes a static checker warning.  Let's make "tmrval" unsigned to avoid
this problem.
