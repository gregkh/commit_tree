Add resilienthandles mount parm

Since many servers (Windows clients, and non-clustered servers) do not
support persistent handles but do support resilient handles, allow
the user to specify a mount option "resilienthandles" in order
to get more reliable connections and less chance of data loss
(at least when SMB2.1 or later).  Default resilient handle
timeout (120 seconds to recent Windows server) is used.
