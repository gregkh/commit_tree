misc: mic: SCIF RMA list operations

This patch adds the implementation for operations performed on the
list of SCIF windows. Examples of such operations includes adding the
windows to the list of registered (or cached) windows, querying the
list of self or remote windows and unregistering windows. The query
operation is used by SCIF APIs which initiate DMAs, CPU copies or
fences to ensure that a window remains valid during a transfer.
