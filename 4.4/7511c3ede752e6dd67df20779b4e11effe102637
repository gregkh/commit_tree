mm: vmalloc: don't remove inexistent guard hole in remove_vm_area()

Commit 71394fe50146 ("mm: vmalloc: add flag preventing guard hole
allocation") missed a spot.  Currently remove_vm_area() decreases vm->size
to "remove" the guard hole page, even when it isn't present.  All but one
users just free the vm_struct rigth away and never access vm->size anyway.

Don't touch the size in remove_vm_area() and have __vunmap() use the
proper get_vm_area_size() helper.
