IB/core: use RCU for uverbs id lookup

The current implementation gets a spin_lock, and at any scale with
qib and hfi1 post send, the lock contention grows exponentially
with the number of QPs.

idr_find() is RCU compatibile, so read doesn't need the lock.

Change to use rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock() in
__idr_get_uobj().

kfree_rcu() is used to insure a grace period between the
idr removal and actual free.
