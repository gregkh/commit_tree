MAINTAINERS: add new maintainer for TPM DEVICE DRIVER

At the moment, no one has time to pay enough attention to this subsystem
so that patches get eventually merged into linux-next. Even critical bug
fixes can lie for weeks.

I'm happy to continue with the current maintainers if they are able to
do their job but if this is not the case I cannot find any other
solution but apply myself for the job.

If there is someone more experienced and/or competent, I'm also happy
to let one take the stand. Anything works as long as it works. I just
want a solution for this bottleneck.
