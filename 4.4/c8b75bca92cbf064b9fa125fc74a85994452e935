drm/vc4: Add KMS support for Raspberry Pi.

This is enough for fbcon and bringing up X using
xf86-video-modesetting.  It doesn't support the 3D accelerator or
power management yet.

v2: Drop FB_HELPER select thanks to Archit's patches.  Do manual init
    ordering instead of using the .load hook.  Structure registration
    more like tegra's, but still using the typical "component" code.
    Drop no-op hooks for atomic_begin and mode_fixup() now that
    they're optional.  Drop sentinel in Makefile.  Fix minor style
    nits I noticed on another reread.

v3: Use the new bcm2835 clk driver to manage pixel/HSM clocks instead
    of having a fixed video mode.  Use exynos-style component driver
    matching instead of devicetree nodes to list the component driver
    instances.  Rename compatibility strings to say bcm2835, and
    distinguish pv0/1/2.  Clean up some h/vsync code, and add in
    interlaced mode setup.  Fix up probe/bind error paths.  Use
    bitops.h macros for vc4_regs.h

v4: Include i2c.h, allow building under COMPILE_TEST, drop msleep now
    that other bugs have been fixed, add timeouts to cpu_relax()
    loops, rename hpd-gpio to hpd-gpios.
