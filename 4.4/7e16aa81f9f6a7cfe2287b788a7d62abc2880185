KVM: arm/arm64: Fix preemptible timer active state crazyness

We were setting the physical active state on the GIC distributor in a
preemptible section, which could cause us to set the active state on
different physical CPU from the one we were actually going to run on,
hacoc ensues.

Since we are no longer descheduling/scheduling soft timers in the
flush/sync timer functions, simply moving the timer flush into a
non-preemptible section.
