Btrfs: add fragment=* debug mount option

In tracking down these weird bitmap problems it was helpful to artificially
create an extremely fragmented file system.  These mount options let us either
fragment data or metadata or both.  With these options I could reproduce all
sorts of weird latencies and hangs that occur under extreme fragmentation and
get them fixed.  Thanks,
