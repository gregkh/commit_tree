ipconfig: send Client-identifier in DHCP requests

A dhcp server may provide parameters to a client from a pool of IP
addresses and using a shared rootfs, or provide a specific set of
parameters for a specific client, usually using the MAC address to
identify each client individually. The dhcp protocol also specifies
a client-id field which can be used to determine the correct
parameters to supply when no MAC address is available. There is
currently no way to tell the kernel to supply a specific client-id,
only the userspace dhcp clients support this feature, but this can
not be used when the network is needed before userspace is available
such as when the root filesystem is on NFS.

This patch is to be able to do something like "ip=dhcp,client_id_type,
client_id_value", as a kernel parameter to enable the kernel to
identify itself to the server.
