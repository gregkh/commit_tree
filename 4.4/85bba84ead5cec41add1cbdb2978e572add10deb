platform/chrome: cros_ec_lpc - Add support for Google Pixel 2

Since the verion of ACPI in Google BIOS does not enumerate the devices
in the LPC bus, the cros_ec_lpc driver resorts to DMI data to check if
a system is supported by the driver and autoload if built as a module.

Add information about the Google Pixel 2 to the DMI device table.
