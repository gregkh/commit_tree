drivers: firmware: psci: add system suspend support

PSCI v1.0 introduces a new API called PSCI_SYSTEM_SUSPEND. This API
provides the mechanism by which the calling OS can request entry into
the deepest possible system sleep state.

It meets all the necessary preconditions for entering suspend to RAM
state in Linux. This patch adds support for PSCI_SYSTEM_SUSPEND in psci
firmware and registers a psci system suspend operation to implement the
suspend-to-RAM(s2r) in a generic way on all the platforms implementing
PSCI.
