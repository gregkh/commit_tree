switchdev: respect SKIP_EOPNOTSUPP flag in case there is no recursion

Caller passing down the SKIP_EOPNOTSUPP switchdev flag expects that
-EOPNOTSUPP cannot be returned. But in case of direct op call without
recurtion, this may happen. So fix this by checking it always on the
end of __switchdev_port_attr_set function.
