perf record: Change 'record.samples' type to unsigned long long

When run "perf record -e", the number of samples showed up is wrong on some
32 bit systems, i.e. powerpc and arm.

For example, run the below commands on 32 bit powerpc:

  perf probe -x /lib/libc.so.6 malloc
  perf record -e probe_libc:malloc -a ls perf.data
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.036 MB perf.data (13829241621624967218 samples) ]

Actually, "perf script" just shows 21 samples. The number of samples is also
absurd since samples is long type, but it is printed as PRIu64.

Build test ran on x86-64, x86, aarch64, arm, mips, ppc and ppc64.

[ Bumped the 'hits' var used together with record.samples to 'unsigned long long' too ]
