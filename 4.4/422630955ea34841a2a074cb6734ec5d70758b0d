mpt3sas: sysfs attribute to report Backup Rail Monitor Status

A new sysfs shost attribute called "BMR_status" is implemented to report
Backup Rail Monitor status.

This attribute is located in:

        /sys/class/scsi_host/host#/BMR_status

When reading this adapter attribute, the driver will output the state of
GPIO[24]. It returns "0" if BMR is healthy and "1" for failure.

If it returns an empty string then it means that there was an error
while obtaining the BMR status. Check dmesg for what error has occurred.

This sysfs shost attribute is mainly for WarpDrive controllers.

This commit is a port of 6c265660c262 ("mpt2sas: Provide sysfs attribute
to report Backup Rail Monitor Status").
