vfs: remove unused wrapper block_page_mkwrite()

The function currently called "__block_page_mkwrite()" used to be called
"block_page_mkwrite()" until a wrapper for this function was added by:

commit 24da4fab5a61 ("vfs: Create __block_page_mkwrite() helper passing
	error values back")

This wrapper, the current "block_page_mkwrite()", is currently unused.
__block_page_mkwrite() is used directly by ext4, nilfs2 and xfs.

Remove the unused wrapper, rename __block_page_mkwrite() back to
block_page_mkwrite() and update the comment above block_page_mkwrite().
