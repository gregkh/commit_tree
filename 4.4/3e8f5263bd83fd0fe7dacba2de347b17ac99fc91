ASoC: tlv320aic3x: Improve tdm support

Before this patch the set_tdm_slots() callback did not store the value
of slot width anywhere. The tdm support only worked if selected slot
width was equal to the sample width. With this patch all sample widths
that fit into the slot width are supported. There unused bits are
filled unnecessarily in the capture direction, but the other end of
the i2s bus should be able to ignore them.
