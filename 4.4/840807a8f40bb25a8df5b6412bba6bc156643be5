mm/oom_kill.c: suppress unnecessary "sharing same memory" message

oom_kill_process() sends SIGKILL to other thread groups sharing victim's
mm.  But printing

  "Kill process %d (%s) sharing same memory\n"

lines makes no sense if they already have pending SIGKILL.  This patch
reduces the "Kill process" lines by printing that line with info level
only if SIGKILL is not pending.
