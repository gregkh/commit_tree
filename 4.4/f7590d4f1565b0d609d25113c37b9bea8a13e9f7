ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add module configuration helpers

To configure a module, driver needs to send input and output PCM
params for a module in DSP. The FE PCM params come from hw_params
ie from user, for a BE they also come from hw_params but from
BE-link fixups.
So based on PCM params required driver has to find a converter
module (src/updown/format) and then do the conversion and
calculate PCM params in these pipelines In this patch we add the
helper modules which allow driver to do these calculations.
