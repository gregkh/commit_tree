jump_label: make static_key_enabled() work on static_key_true/false types too

static_key_enabled() can be used on struct static_key but not on its
wrapper types static_key_true and static_key_false.  The function is
useful for debugging and management of static keys.  Update it so that
it can be used for the wrapper types too.
