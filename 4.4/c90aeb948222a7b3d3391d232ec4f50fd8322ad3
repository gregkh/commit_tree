once: make helper generic for calling functions once

Make the get_random_once() helper generic enough, so that functions
in general would only be called once, where one user of this is then
net_get_random_once().

The only implementation specific call is to get_random_bytes(), all
the rest of this *_once() facility would be duplicated among different
subsystems otherwise. The new DO_ONCE() helper will be used by prandom()
later on, but might also be useful for other scenarios/subsystems as
well where a one-time initialization in often-called, possibly fast
path code could occur.
