Input: hp_sdc_rtc - fix y2038 problem in proc_show

hp_sdc_rtc_proc_show() use timeval to store the time, which will overflow
in 2038.

This patch fixes this problem by replacing timeval with timespec64.
hp_sdc_rtc_proc_show() only output string, so that userspace will work
normally if we apply this patch.

Not all timer in i8042 have y2038 risk(handshake, match timer, etc),
Replacements in those timer are just for consistency.
