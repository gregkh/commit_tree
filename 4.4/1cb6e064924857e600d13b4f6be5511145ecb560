powerpc/book3e: support CONFIG_RELOCATABLE

book3e is different with book3s since 3s includes the exception
vectors code in head_64.S as it relies on absolute addressing
which is only possible within this compilation unit. So we have
to get that label address with got.

And when boot a relocated kernel, we should reset ipvr properly again
after .relocate.
