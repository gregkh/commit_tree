crypto: marvell/cesa - keep creq->state in CPU endian format at all times

Currently, we read/write the state in CPU endian, but on the final
request, we convert its endian according to the requested algorithm.
(md5 is little endian, SHA are big endian.)

Always keep creq->state in CPU native endian format, and perform the
necessary conversion when copying the hash to the result.
