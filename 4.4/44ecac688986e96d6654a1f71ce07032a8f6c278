staging/lustre/llite: cleanup open handle for client open failure

For open case, the client side open handling thread may hit error
after the MDT grant the open. Under such case, the client should
send close RPC to the MDT as cleanup; otherwise, the open handle
on the MDT will be leaked there until the client umount or evicted.

If the LFSCK marks LU_OBJECT_HEARD_BANSHEE on the MDT-object that is
opened by others for repairing some inconsistency, such as repairing
multiple-referenced OST-object, because the leaked open handle still
references the MDT-object, then it will block the subsequent threads
that want to locate such object via FID.
