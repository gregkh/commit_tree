MIPS: Always use r4k_wait_irqoff for MIPSr6

Prior to release 6 of the MIPS architecture it has been implementation
dependent whether masked interrupts cause a wait instruction to return,
so the kernel has effectively had to maintain a whitelist of cores upon
which it is safe to use the r4k_wait_irqoff cpu_wait implementation.
With MIPSr6 this is no longer implementation dependent and
r4k_wait_irqoff can always be used.

Remove the existing I6400 case which will no longer ever be hit, and was
incorrect anyway since I6400 & r6 in general doesn't have the WII bit.
