ALSA: firewire-digi00x: add proc node to show clock status

This commit adds proc node to show current clock status for debugging.

As long as testing Digi 002 rack, registers can show local clock rate,
local clock source. When external clock input such as S/PDIF is
connected, the registers show the detection and external clock rate.

Additionally, the registers show the mode of optical digital input
interface. Although, a tester with Digi 003 rack reports this makes no
sense. Further investigation is required for Digi 003 series.

Besides, in Digi 002 rack, the S/PDIF format must be IEC 60958-4,
so-called professional.
