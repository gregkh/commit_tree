tcp: ensure proper barriers in lockless contexts

Some functions access TCP sockets without holding a lock and
might output non consistent data, depending on compiler and or
architecture.

tcp_diag_get_info(), tcp_get_info(), tcp_poll(), get_tcp4_sock() ...

Introduce sk_state_load() and sk_state_store() to fix the issues,
and more clearly document where this lack of locking is happening.
