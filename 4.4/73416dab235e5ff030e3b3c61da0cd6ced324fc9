Btrfs: move kobj stuff out of dev_replace lock range

To avoid deadlock described in commit 084b6e7c7607 ("btrfs: Fix a
lockdep warning when running xfstest."), we should move kobj stuff out
of dev_replace lock range.

  "It is because the btrfs_kobj_{add/rm}_device() will call memory
  allocation with GFP_KERNEL,
  which may flush fs page cache to free space, waiting for it self to do
  the commit, causing the deadlock.

  To solve the problem, move btrfs_kobj_{add/rm}_device() out of the
  dev_replace lock range, also involing split the
  btrfs_rm_dev_replace_srcdev() function into remove and free parts.

  Now only btrfs_rm_dev_replace_remove_srcdev() is called in dev_replace
  lock range, and kobj_{add/rm} and btrfs_rm_dev_replace_free_srcdev() are
  called out of the lock range."
