ASoC: rsnd: add common mod confirm method

Renesas sound has SSI/SRC/DVC/MIX/ADG modules, and these have original
register mapping. Thus this driver is using regmap field, and each module
is using it based on each module ID.

Sometimes, each module needs other module to controlling. but current each
function is using just "mod" as parameter name. This is confusable.
For example, if SSI0 and SRC2 are connected, and if SRC module function
has bug of module access, and if it needs to control connected SSI,
SRC function will access to SSI2 (It should access to SSI0, but it uses
SRC's ID 2). This is easy to happen in current driver style.

To avoid this kind of confusable trouble, this patch adds module confirm
macro for debug purpose.
