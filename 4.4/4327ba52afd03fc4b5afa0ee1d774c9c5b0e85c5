ext4, jbd2: ensure entering into panic after recording an error in superblock

If a EXT4 filesystem utilizes JBD2 journaling and an error occurs, the
journaling will be aborted first and the error number will be recorded
into JBD2 superblock and, finally, the system will enter into the
panic state in "errors=panic" option.  But, in the rare case, this
sequence is little twisted like the below figure and it will happen
that the system enters into panic state, which means the system reset
in mobile environment, before completion of recording an error in the
journal superblock. In this case, e2fsck cannot recognize that the
filesystem failure occurred in the previous run and the corruption
wouldn't be fixed.

Task A                        Task B
ext4_handle_error()
-> jbd2_journal_abort()
  -> __journal_abort_soft()
    -> __jbd2_journal_abort_hard()
    | -> journal->j_flags |= JBD2_ABORT;
    |
    |                         __ext4_abort()
    |                         -> jbd2_journal_abort()
    |                         | -> __journal_abort_soft()
    |                         |   -> if (journal->j_flags & JBD2_ABORT)
    |                         |           return;
    |                         -> panic()
    |
    -> jbd2_journal_update_sb_errno()
