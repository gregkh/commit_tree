rcu: Remove deprecated rcu_lockdep_assert()

The old rcu_lockdep_assert() was retained to ease handling of incoming
patches, but any use will result in deprecated warnings.  However, its
replacement, RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN(), is now upstream.  It is therefore
time to remove rcu_lockdep_assert(), which this commit does.
