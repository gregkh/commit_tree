mm, compaction: export tracepoints zone names to userspace

Some compaction tracepoints use zone->name to print which zone is being
compacted.  This works for in-kernel printing, but not userspace trace
printing of raw captured trace such as via trace-cmd report.

This patch uses zone_idx() instead of zone->name as the raw value, and
when printing, converts the zone_type to string using the appropriate EM()
macros and some ugly tricks to overcome the problem that half the values
depend on CONFIG_ options and one does not simply use #ifdef inside of
#define.

trace-cmd output before:
transhuge-stres-4235  [000]   453.149280: mm_compaction_finished: node=0
zone=ffffffff81815d7a order=9 ret=partial

after:
transhuge-stres-4235  [000]   453.149280: mm_compaction_finished: node=0
zone=Normal   order=9 ret=partial
