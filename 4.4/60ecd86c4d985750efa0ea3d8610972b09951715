vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the
allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.
