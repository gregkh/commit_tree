raid5: disable batch with log enabled

With log enabled, r5l_write_stripe will add the stripe to log. With
batch, several stripes are linked together. The stripes must be in the
same state. While with log, the log/reclaim unit is stripe, we can't
guarantee the several stripes are in the same state. Disabling batch for
log now.
