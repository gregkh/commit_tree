unicore32: nb0916: Use PWM lookup table

Use a PWM lookup table to provide the PWM to the pwm-backlight device.
The driver has a legacy code path that is required only because boards
still use the legacy method of requesting PWMs by global ID. Replacing
these usages allows that legacy fallback to be removed.
