i2c: img-scb: verify support for requested bit rate

The requested bit rate can be outside the range supported by the driver.
The maximum bit rate this driver supports at the moment is 400Khz.

If the requested bit rate is larger than the maximum supported by the
driver, set the bitrate to the maximum supported before bitrate_khz is
calculated.

Maximum speed supported by the driver can be increased to 1Mhz by
adding support for "fast plus mode" in the future.
