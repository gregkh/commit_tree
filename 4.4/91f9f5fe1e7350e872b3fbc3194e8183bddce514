xfs: avoid null *src in memcpy call in xlog_write

The gcc undefined behavior sanitizer caught this; surely
any sane memcpy implementation will no-op if size == 0,
but behavior with a *src of NULL is technically undefined
(declared nonnull), so avoid it here.

We are actually in this situation frequently via
xlog_commit_record(), because:

        struct xfs_log_iovec reg = {
                .i_addr = NULL,
                .i_len = 0,
                .i_type = XLOG_REG_TYPE_COMMIT,
        };
