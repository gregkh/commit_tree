Btrfs: cut down on loops through the allocator

We try really really hard to make allocations, but sometimes it is just not
going to happen, especially when free space is extremely fragmented.  So add a
few short cuts through the looping states.  For example if we couldn't allocate
a chunk, just go straight to the NO_EMPTY_SIZE loop.  If there are no uncached
block groups and we've done a full search, go straight to the ALLOC_CHUNK stage.
And finally if we already have empty_size and empty_cluster set to 0 go ahead
and return -ENOSPC.  Thanks,
