ARC: mm: switch pgtable_to to pte_t *

ARC is the only arch with unsigned long type (vs. struct page *).
Historically this was done to avoid the page_address() calls in various
arch hooks which need to get the virtual/logical address of the table.

Some arches alternately define it as pte_t *, and is as efficient as
unsigned long (generated code doesn't change)
