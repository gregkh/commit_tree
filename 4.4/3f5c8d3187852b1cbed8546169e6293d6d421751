device property: Add fwnode_property_match_string()

Sometimes it is useful to be able to extract an index of certain string
value from an array of strings. A typical use case is to give a name to a
DMA channel, PWM, clock and so on.

Provide an implementation using unified device property accessors that
follows of_property_match_string() but works for all supported fwnodes.
