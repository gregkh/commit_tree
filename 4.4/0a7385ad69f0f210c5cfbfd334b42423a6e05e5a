NVMe: Simplify device resume on io queue failure

Releasing IO queues and disks was done in a work queue outside the
controller resume context to delete namespaces if the controller failed
after a resume from suspend. This is unnecessary since we can resume
a device asynchronously.

This patch makes resume use probe_work so it can directly remove
namespaces if the device is manageable but not IO capable. Since the
deleting disks was the only reason we had the convoluted "reset_workfn",
this patch removes that unnecessary indirection.
