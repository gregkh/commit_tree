block: loop: prepare for supporing direct IO

This patches provides one interface for enabling direct IO
from user space:

	- userspace(such as losetup) can pass 'file' which is
	opened/fcntl as O_DIRECT

Also __loop_update_dio() is introduced to check if direct I/O
can be used on current loop setting.

The last big change is to introduce LO_FLAGS_DIRECT_IO flag
for userspace to know if direct IO is used to access backing
file.
