extcon: arizona: Don't disable debounce for inverted jacks

Whilst the jack is connected we disable the jack detection debounce to
ensure as quick as possible a detection of jack removal. However, it is
only safe to disable the jack debounce whilst the jack is connected if
using the micd clamp or the jack is not inverted. Otherwise spurious
interrupts might be generated when we re-enable the debounce.
