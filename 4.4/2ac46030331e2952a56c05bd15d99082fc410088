virtio-net: Stop doing DMA from the stack

Once virtio starts using the DMA API, we won't be able to safely DMA
from the stack.  virtio-net does a couple of config DMA requests
from small stack buffers -- switch to using dynamically-allocated
memory.

This should have no effect on any performance-critical code paths.
