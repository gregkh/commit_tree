pstore: add pstore unregister

pstore doesn't support unregistering yet. It was marked as TODO.
This patch adds some code to fix it:
 1) Add functions to unregister kmsg/console/ftrace/pmsg.
 2) Add a function to free compression buffer.
 3) Unmap the memory and free it.
 4) Add a function to unregister pstore filesystem.
