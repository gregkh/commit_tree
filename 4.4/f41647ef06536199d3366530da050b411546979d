RDMA/be2net: Remove open and close entry points

Recently Dough Ledford reported a deadlock happening
between ocrdma-load sequence and NetworkManager service
issueing "open" on be2net interface.

The deadlock happens when any be2net hook (e.g. open/close) is called
in parallel to insmod ocrdma.ko.

A. be2net is sending administrative open/close event to ocrdma holding
   device_list_mutex. It does this from ndo_open/ndo_stop hooks of be2net.
   So sequence of locks is rtnl_lock---> device_list lock

B.  When new ocrdma roce device gets registered, infiniband stack now
    takes rtnl_lock in ib_register_device() in GID initialization routines.
    So sequence of locks in this path is device_list lock ---> rtnl_lock.

This improper locking sequence causes deadlock.

In order to resolve the above deadlock condition, ocrdma intorduced a
patch to stop listening to administrative open/close events generated from
be2net driver. It now depends on link-state-change async-event generated from
CNA. This change leaves behind dead code which used to generate administrative
open/close events. This patch cleans-up all that dead code from be2net.
