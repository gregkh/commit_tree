Bluetooth: btbcm: Read the local name in setup stage

The Broadcom Bluetooth controllers have the chip name included in the
ROM firmware or later in the patchram firmware. For debugging purposes
read the local name and print it out. This is only done during setup
stage and only once before loading the firmware and once after loading
the firmware.

For the Broadcom based controllers from Apple, the name is only read once
after determining the chip id.
