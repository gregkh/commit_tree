x86/fpu: Move XSAVE-disabling code to a helper

When we want to _completely_ disable XSAVE support as far as
the kernel is concerned, we have a big set of feature flags
to clear.  We currently only do this in cases where the user
asks for it to be disabled, but we are about to expand the
places where we do it to handle errors too.

Move the code in to xstate.c, and put it in the xstate.h
header.  We will use it in the next patch too.
