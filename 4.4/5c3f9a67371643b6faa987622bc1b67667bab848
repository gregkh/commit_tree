mm: page migration remove_migration_ptes at lock+unlock level

Clean up page migration a little more by calling remove_migration_ptes()
from the same level, on success or on failure, from __unmap_and_move() or
from unmap_and_move_huge_page().

Don't reset page->mapping of a PageAnon old page in move_to_new_page(),
leave that to when the page is freed.  Except for here in page migration,
it has been an invariant that a PageAnon (bit set in page->mapping) page
stays PageAnon until it is freed, and I think we're safer to keep to that.

And with the above rearrangement, it's necessary because zap_pte_range()
wants to identify whether a migration entry represents a file or an anon
page, to update the appropriate rss stats without waiting on it.
