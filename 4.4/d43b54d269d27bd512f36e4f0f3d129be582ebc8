serial: Enable Freescale 16550 workaround on arm

The same serial hardware is present on LS2080A which is arm64, and
LS1021A which is arm32, so don't limit the workaround to PPC.

Unlike PPC which uses arch/powerpc/kernel/legacy_serial.c, the ARM
targets use drivers/tty/serial/of_serial.c, so add the handle_irq
override check there as well.
