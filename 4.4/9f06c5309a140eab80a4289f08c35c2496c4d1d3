ARM: dts: sun8i: Make ippo-q8h-v1.2.dts a symlink to q8-tablet.dts

A33 Q8 tablets with the ippo-q8h-v1.2 pcb will work fine with the
generic q8-tablet.dts and given the many variants of PCBs found in
Q8 tablets using such a specific dts name was a mistake in hindsight.

We cannot just drop the ippo-q8h-v1.2.dtb as existing u-boot configs
may very well point to it.
