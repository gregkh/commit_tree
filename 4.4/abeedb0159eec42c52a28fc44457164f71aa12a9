spi: Setup the master controller driver before setting the chipselect

SPI controllers may need to be properly setup before chip selects
can be used. Therefore, wait until the spi controller has a chance
to perform their setup procedure before trying to use the chip
select.

This also insures that the chip selects pins are in a good
state before asseting them which otherwise may cause confusion.
