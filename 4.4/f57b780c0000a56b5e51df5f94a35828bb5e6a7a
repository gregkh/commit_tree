iw_cxgb4: fix misuse of ep->ord for minimum ird calculation

When calculating the minimum ird in c4iw_accept_cr(), we need to always
have a value of at least 1 if the RTR message is a 0B read.  The code
was
incorrectly using ep->ord for this logic which was incorrectly adjusting
the ird and causing incorrect ord/ird negotiation when using MPAv2 to
negotiate these values.
