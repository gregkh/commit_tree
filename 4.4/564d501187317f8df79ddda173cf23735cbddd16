nfit: in acpi_nfit_init, break on a 0-length table

If acpi_nfit_init is called (such as from nfit_test), with an nfit table
that has more memory allocated than it needs (and a similarly large
'size' field, add_tables would happily keep adding null SPA Range tables
filling up all available memory.

Make it friendlier by breaking out if a 0-length header is found in any
of the tables.
