ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: enable UniPhier I2C drivers

These two drivers were merged into the I2C sub-system by
commit dd6fd4a32793 ("i2c: uniphier: add UniPhier FIFO-less I2C driver")
and commit 6a62974b667f ("i2c: uniphier_f: add UniPhier FIFO-builtin I2C
driver").

Enable them from arch/arm/configs/multi_v7_defconfig.
