[media] s5p-jpeg: add support for 5433

JPEG IP found in Exynos5433 is similar to what is in Exynos4, but
there are some subtle differences which this patch takes into account.

The most important difference is in what is processed by the JPEG IP and
what has to be provided to it. In case of 5433 the IP does not parse
Huffman and quantisation tables, so this has to be performed with the CPU
and the majority of the code in this patch does that.

A small but important difference is in what address is passed to the JPEG
IP. In case of 5433 it is the SOS (start of scan) position, which is
natural, because the headers must be parsed elsewhere.

There is also a difference in how the hardware is put to work in
device_run.

Data structures are extended as appropriate to accommodate the above
changes.
