tcp/dccp: fix behavior of stale SYN_RECV request sockets

When a TCP/DCCP listener is closed, its pending SYN_RECV request sockets
become stale, meaning 3WHS can not complete.

But current behavior is wrong :
incoming packets finding such stale sockets are dropped.

We need instead to cleanup the request socket and perform another
lookup :
- Incoming ACK will give a RST answer,
- SYN rtx might find another listener if available.
- We expedite cleanup of request sockets and old listener socket.
