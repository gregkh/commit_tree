i40e/i40evf: avoid mutex re-init

If the driver were to happen to have a mutex held while
the i40e_init_adminq call was called, the init_adminq might
inadvertently call mutex_init on a lock that was held
which is a violation of the calling semantics.

Fix this by avoiding adminq.c code allocating/freeing this memory, and
then do the same work only once in probe/remove.

Testing Hints (Required if no HSD): for VF, load i40evf in bare metal
and echo 32 > sriov_numvfs; echo 0 > sriov_numvfs in a loop.  Yes this
is a horrible thing to do.
