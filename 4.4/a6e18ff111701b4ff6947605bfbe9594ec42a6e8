vlan: Fix untag operations of stacked vlans with REORDER_HEADER off

When we have multiple stacked vlan devices all of which have
turned off REORDER_HEADER flag, the untag operation does not
locate the ethernet addresses correctly for nested vlans.
The reason is that in case of REORDER_HEADER flag being off,
the outer vlan headers are put back and the mac_len is adjusted
to account for the presense of the header.  Then, the subsequent
untag operation, for the next level vlan, always use VLAN_ETH_HLEN
to locate the begining of the ethernet header and that ends up
being a multiple of 4 bytes short of the actuall beginning
of the mac header (the multiple depending on the how many vlan
encapsulations ethere are).

As a reslult, if there are multiple levles of vlan devices
with REODER_HEADER being off, the recevied packets end up
being dropped.

To solve this, we use skb->mac_len as the offset.  The value
is always set on receive path and starts out as a ETH_HLEN.
The value is also updated when the vlan header manupations occur
so we know it will be correct.
