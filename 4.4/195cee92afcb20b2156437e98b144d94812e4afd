MIPS: Fix duplicate CP0_* definitions.

Remove the definition in locore.S and move a few of the other similar
definitions in asm/mipsregs.h too. CP0_INTCTL, CP0_SRSCTL, & CP0_SRSMAP
are unused so they're just dropped instead. CP0_DDATA_LO is left where
it is as I have patches to eliminate its use in locore.S and it
otherwise is unlikely to need to be used from assembly code.
