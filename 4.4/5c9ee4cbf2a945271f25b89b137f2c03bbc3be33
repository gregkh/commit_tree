ocfs2: fix BUG when calculate new backup super

When resizing, it firstly extends the last gd.  Once it should backup
super in the gd, it calculates new backup super and update the
corresponding value.

But it currently doesn't consider the situation that the backup super is
already done.  And in this case, it still sets the bit in gd bitmap and
then decrease from bg_free_bits_count, which leads to a corrupted gd and
trigger the BUG in ocfs2_block_group_set_bits:

    BUG_ON(le16_to_cpu(bg->bg_free_bits_count) < num_bits);

So check whether the backup super is done and then do the updates.
