MIPS: Initial implementation of a VDSO

Add an initial implementation of a proper (i.e. an ELF shared library)
VDSO. With this commit it does not export any symbols, it only replaces
the current signal return trampoline page. A later commit will add user
implementations of gettimeofday()/clock_gettime().

To support both new toolchains and old ones which don't generate ABI
flags section, we define its content manually and then use a tool
(genvdso) to patch up the section to have the correct name and type.
genvdso also extracts symbol offsets ({,rt_}sigreturn) needed by the
kernel, and generates a C file containing a "struct mips_vdso_image"
containing both the VDSO data and these offsets. This C file is
compiled into the kernel.

On 64-bit kernels we require a different VDSO for each supported ABI,
so we may build up to 3 different VDSOs. The VDSO to use is selected by
the mips_abi structure.

A kernel/user shared data page is created and mapped below the VDSO
image. This is currently empty, but will be used by the user time
function implementations which are added later.

[markos.chandras@imgtec.com:
- Add more comments
- Move abi detection in genvdso.h since it's the get_symbol function
that needs it.
- Add an R6 specific way to calculate the base address of VDSO in order
to avoid the branch instruction which affects performance.
- Do not patch .gnu.attributes since it's not needed for dynamic linking.
- Simplify Makefile a little bit.
- checkpatch fixes
- Restrict VDSO support for binutils < 2.25 for pre-R6
- Include atomic64.h for O32 variant on MIPS64]
