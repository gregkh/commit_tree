arm64: Keep track of CPU feature registers

This patch adds an infrastructure to keep track of the CPU feature
registers on the system. For each register, the infrastructure keeps
track of the system wide safe value of the feature bits. Also, tracks
the which fields of a register should be matched strictly across all
the CPUs on the system for the SANITY check infrastructure.

The feature bits are classified into following 3 types depending on
the implication of the possible values. This information is used to
decide the safe value for a feature.

LOWER_SAFE  - The smaller value is safer
HIGHER_SAFE - The bigger value is safer
EXACT       - We can't decide between the two, so a predefined safe_value is used.

This infrastructure will be later used to make better decisions for:

 - Kernel features (e.g, KVM, Debug)
 - SANITY Check
 - CPU capability
 - ELF HWCAP
 - Exposing CPU Feature register to userspace.
