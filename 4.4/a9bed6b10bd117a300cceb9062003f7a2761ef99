i2c: at91: manage unexpected RXRDY flag when starting a transfer

In some cases, we could start a new i2c transfer with the RXRDY flag
set. It is not a clean state and it leads to print annoying error
messages even if there no real issue. The cause is only having garbage
data in the Receive Holding Register because of a weird behavior of the
RXRDY flag.
