test_printf: test printf family at runtime

This adds a simple module for testing the kernel's printf facilities.
Previously, some %p extensions have caused a wrong return value in case
the entire output didn't fit and/or been unusable in kasprintf().  This
should help catch such issues.  Also, it should help ensure that changes
to the formatting algorithms don't break anything.

I'm not sure if we have a struct dentry or struct file lying around at
boot time or if we can fake one, but most %p extensions should be
testable, as should the ordinary number and string formatting.

The nature of vararg functions means we can't use a more conventional
table-driven approach.

For now, this is mostly a skeleton; contributions are very
welcome. Some tests are/will be slightly annoying to write, since the
expected output depends on stuff like CONFIG_*, sizeof(long), runtime
values etc.
