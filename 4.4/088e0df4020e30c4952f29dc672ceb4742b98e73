drm/i915/gtt: Allow >= 4GB offsets in X86_32

Similar to commit c44ef60e437019b8ca1dab8b4d2e8761fd4ce1e9 ("drm/i915/gtt:
Allow >= 4GB sizes for vm"), i915_gem_obj_offset and i915_gem_obj_ggtt_offset
return an unsigned long, which in only 4-bytes long in 32-bit kernels.

Change return type (and other related offset variables) to u64.

Since Global GTT is always limited to 4GB, this change would not be required
in i915_gem_obj_ggtt_offset, but this is done for consistency.

v2: Remove unnecessary offset variable in do_pin, as we already have
    vma->node.start (Chris).
    Update GGTT offset too (Tvrtko).
