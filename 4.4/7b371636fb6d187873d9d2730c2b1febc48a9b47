blk-mq: return tag/queue combo in the make_request_fn handlers

Return a cookie, blk_qc_t, from the blk-mq make request functions, that
allows a later caller to uniquely identify a specific IO. The cookie
doesn't mean anything to the caller, but the caller can use it to later
pass back to the block layer. The block layer can then identify the
hardware queue and request from that cookie.
