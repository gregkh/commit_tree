arm64: Move swapper pagetable definitions

Move the kernel pagetable (both swapper and idmap) definitions
from the generic asm/page.h to a new file, asm/kernel-pgtable.h.

This is mostly a cosmetic change, to clean up the asm/page.h to
get rid of the arch specific details which are not needed by the
generic code.

Also renames the symbols to prevent conflicts. e.g,
 	BLOCK_SHIFT => SWAPPER_BLOCK_SHIFT
