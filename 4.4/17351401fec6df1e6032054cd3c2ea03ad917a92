i40e: fixup padding issue in get_cee_dcb_cfg_v1_resp

The struct i40e_aqc_get_cee_dcb_cfg_v1_resp was originally defined with
word boundary layout issues, which most compilers deal with by silently
adding padding, making the actual struct larger than designed.
This patch adds an extra byte in fields reserved3 and reserved4 to directly
acknowledge that padding.

Because the struct doesn't actually change in size or layout, this doesn't
constitute a change in the API.
