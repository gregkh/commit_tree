xtensa: fixes for configs without loop option

Build-time fixes:
- make lbeg/lend/lcount save/restore conditional on kernel entry;
- don't clear lcount in platform_restart functions unconditionally.

Run-time fixes:
- use correct end of range register in __endla paired with __loopt, not
  the unused temporary register. This fixes .bss zero-initialization.
  Update comments in asmmacro.h;
- don't clobber a10 in the usercopy that leads to access to unmapped
  memory.
