s390/fpu: add static FPU save area for init_task

Previously, the init task did not have an allocated FPU save area and
saving an FPU state was not possible.  Now if the vector extension is
always enabled, provide a static FPU save area to save FPU states of
vector instructions that can be executed quite early.
