net/mlx5_core: Prepare cmd interface to system errors handling

In preparation to handling system errors at the mlx5_core level, change the
interface of cmd_work_handler to accept a 64 bit argument for the vector.

This allows to encode a flag that signifies when the handler is called
as a result of a driver logic that wishes to terminate commands that
the hardware may not be able to terminate. Such command completions
are detected at the handler and proper return status is encoded.

To be able to terminate page handler commands, we make sure to set
the corresponding bit in the bitmask.
