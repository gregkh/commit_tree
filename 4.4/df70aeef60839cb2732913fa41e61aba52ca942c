clk: at91: add generated clock driver

Add a new type of clocks that can be provided to a peripheral.
In addition to the peripheral clock, this new clock that can use several
input clocks as parents can generate divided rates.
This would allow a peripheral to have finer grained clocks for generating
a baud rate, clocking an asynchronous part or having more
options in frequency.
