net/core: ensure features get disabled on new lower devs

With moving netdev_sync_lower_features() after the .ndo_set_features
calls, I neglected to verify that devices added *after* a flag had been
disabled on an upper device were properly added with that flag disabled as
well. This currently happens, because we exit __netdev_update_features()
when we see dev->features == features for the upper dev. We can retain the
optimization of leaving without calling .ndo_set_features with a bit of
tweaking and a goto here.
