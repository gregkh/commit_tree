watchdog: Always evaluate new timeout against min_timeout

Up to now, a new timeout value is only evaluated against min_timeout
if max_timeout is provided. This does not really make sense; a driver
can have a minimum timeout even if it does not have a maximum timeout.
Ensure that it is not smaller than min_timeout, even if max_timeout
is not set.
