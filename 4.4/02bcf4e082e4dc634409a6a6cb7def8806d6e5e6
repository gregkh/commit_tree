ipv6: Check rt->dst.from for the DST_NOCACHE route

All DST_NOCACHE rt6_info used to have rt->dst.from set to
its parent.

After commit 8e3d5be73681 ("ipv6: Avoid double dst_free"),
DST_NOCACHE is also set to rt6_info which does not have
a parent (i.e. rt->dst.from is NULL).

This patch catches the rt->dst.from == NULL case.
