staging: comedi: usbduxfast: chanlist check is Step 5 of (*do_cmdtest)

The channel list should be checked in Step 5 of the (*do_cmdtest) not
as part of the (*do_cmd). Factor the check out of usbduxfast_ai_cmd().

Tidy up the factored out code. The channel number 'i' will never be
greater than NUMCHANNELS due to the subdevice setup and the checks
done in the code. The up/down of the semaphore is also not needed
because the (*do_cmdtest) never actually tries to access the hardware.
