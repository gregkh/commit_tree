xprtrdma: Enable swap-on-NFS/RDMA

After adding a swapfile on an NFS/RDMA mount and removing the
normal swap partition, I was able to push the NFS client well
into swap without any issue.

I forgot to swapoff the NFS file before rebooting. This pinned
the NFS mount and the IB core and provider, causing shutdown to
hang. I think this is expected and safe behavior. Probably
shutdown scripts should "swapoff -a" before unmounting any
filesystems.
