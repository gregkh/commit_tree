perf tests: Introduce iterator function for tests

In preparation for introducing more arrays of tests, e.g. "arch tests"
(architecture-specific tests), abstract the code to iterate over the
list of tests into a helper function.

This way, code that uses a 'struct test' doesn't need to worry about how
the tests are grouped together and changes to the list of tests doesn't
require changes to the code using it.
