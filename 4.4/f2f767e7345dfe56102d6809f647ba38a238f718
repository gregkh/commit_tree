btrfs: trimming some start_transaction() code away

Just call kmem_cache_zalloc() instead of calling kmem_cache_alloc().
We're just initializing most fields to 0, false and NULL later on
_anyway_, so to make the code mode readable and potentially gain
a bit of performance (completely untested claim), we should fill our
btrfs_trans_handle with zeros on allocation then just initialize
those five remaining fields (not counting the list_heads) as normal.
