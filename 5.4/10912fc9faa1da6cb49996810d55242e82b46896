i40e: simplify Rx buffer recycle

Currently, the dma, addr and handle are modified when we reuse Rx buffers
in zero-copy mode. However, this is not required as the inputs to the
function are copies, not the original values themselves. As we use the
copies within the function, we can use the original 'old_bi' values
directly without having to mask and add the headroom.
