PM: sleep: Integrate suspend-to-idle with generig suspend flow

After previous changes the suspend-to-idle code flow can be
integrated more tightly with the generic system suspend code flow
by making suspend_enter() call s2idle_loop() later and removing
the direct invocations of dpm_noirq_begin(),
dpm_noirq_suspend_devices(), dpm_noirq_end(), and
dpm_noirq_resume_devices() from the latter, so do that.

This change is not expected to alter functionality.
