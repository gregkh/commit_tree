dt-bindings: mediatek: Add binding for mt8183 IOMMU and SMI

This patch adds decriptions for mt8183 IOMMU and SMI.

mt8183 has only one M4U like mt8173 and is also MTK IOMMU gen2 which
uses ARM Short-Descriptor translation table format.

The mt8183 M4U-SMI HW diagram is as below:

                          EMI
                           |
                          M4U
                           |
                       ----------
                       |        |
                   gals0-rx   gals1-rx
                       |        |
                       |        |
                   gals0-tx   gals1-tx
                       |        |
                      ------------
                       SMI Common
                      ------------
                           |
  +-----+-----+--------+-----+-----+-------+-------+
  |     |     |        |     |     |       |       |
  |     |  gals-rx  gals-rx  |   gals-rx gals-rx gals-rx
  |     |     |        |     |     |       |       |
  |     |     |        |     |     |       |       |
  |     |  gals-tx  gals-tx  |   gals-tx gals-tx gals-tx
  |     |     |        |     |     |       |       |

All the connections are HW fixed, SW can NOT adjust it.

Compared with mt8173, we add a GALS(Global Async Local Sync) module
between SMI-common and M4U, and additional GALS between larb2/3/5/6
and SMI-common. GALS can help synchronize for the modules in different
clock frequency, it can be seen as a "asynchronous fifo".

GALS can only help transfer the command/data while it doesn't have
the configuring register, thus it has the special "smi" clock and it
doesn't have the "apb" clock. From the diagram above, we add "gals0"
and "gals1" clocks for smi-common and add a "gals" clock for smi-larb.

>From the diagram above, IPU0/IPU1(Image Processor Unit) and CCU(Camera
Control Unit) is connected with smi-common directly, we can take them
as "larb2", "larb3" and "larb7", and their register spaces are
different with the normal larb.
