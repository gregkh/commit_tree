KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Fix software breakpoints

QEMU's kvm_handle_debug() function identifies software breakpoints by checking
for a value of 0 in kvm_debug_exit_arch's status field. Since this field isn't
explicitly set to 0 when the software breakpoint instruction is detected, any
previous non-zero value present causes a hang in QEMU as it tries to process
the breakpoint instruction incorrectly as a hardware breakpoint.

Ensure that the kvm_debug_exit_arch status field is set to 0 when the software
breakpoint instruction is detected (similar to the existing logic in booke.c
and e500_emulate.c) to restore software breakpoint functionality under Book3S
PR.
