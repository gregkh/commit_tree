perf/x86/amd/ibs: Handle erratum #420 only on the affected CPU family (10h)

This saves us writing the IBS control MSR twice when disabling the
event.

I searched revision guides for all families since 10h, and did not
find occurrence of erratum #420, nor anything remotely similar:
so we isolate the secondary MSR write to family 10h only.

Also unconditionally update the count mask for IBS Op implementations
that have read & writeable current count (CurCnt) fields in addition
to the MaxCnt field.  These bits were reserved on prior
implementations, and therefore shouldn't have negative impact.
