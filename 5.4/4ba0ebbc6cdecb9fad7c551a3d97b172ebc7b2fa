net: dsa: Fix off-by-one number of calls to devlink_port_unregister

When a function such as dsa_slave_create fails, currently the following
stack trace can be seen:

devlink_free is complaining right here:

	WARN_ON(!list_empty(&devlink->port_list));

This happens because devlink_port_unregister is no longer done right
away in dsa_port_setup when a DSA_PORT_TYPE_USER has failed.
Vivien said about this change that:

    Also no need to call devlink_port_unregister from within dsa_port_setup
    as this step is inconditionally handled by dsa_port_teardown on error.

which is not really true. The devlink_port_unregister function _is_
being called unconditionally from within dsa_port_setup, but not for
this port that just failed, just for the previous ones which were set
up.

ports_teardown:
	for (i = 0; i < port; i++)
		dsa_port_teardown(&ds->ports[i]);

Initially I was tempted to fix this by extending the "for" loop to also
cover the port that failed during setup. But this could have potentially
unforeseen consequences unrelated to devlink_port or even other types of
ports than user ports, which I can't really test for. For example, if
for some reason devlink_port_register itself would fail, then
unconditionally unregistering it in dsa_port_teardown would not be a
smart idea. The list might go on.

So just make dsa_port_setup undo the setup it had done upon failure, and
let the for loop undo the work of setting up the previous ports, which
are guaranteed to be brought up to a consistent state.
