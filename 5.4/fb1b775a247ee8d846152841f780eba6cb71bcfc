net: sched: add skbedit of ptype action to hardware IR

TC rules can impliment skbedit actions. Currently actions that modify the
skb mark are passed to offloading drivers via the hardware intermediate
representation in the flow_offload API.

Extend this to include skbedit actions that modify the packet type of the
skb. Such actions may be used to set the ptype to HOST when redirecting a
packet to ingress.
