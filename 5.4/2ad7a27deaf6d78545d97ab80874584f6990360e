KVM: PPC: Book3S: Enable XIVE native capability only if OPAL has required functions

There are some POWER9 machines where the OPAL firmware does not support
the OPAL_XIVE_GET_QUEUE_STATE and OPAL_XIVE_SET_QUEUE_STATE calls.
The impact of this is that a guest using XIVE natively will not be able
to be migrated successfully.  On the source side, the get_attr operation
on the KVM native device for the KVM_DEV_XIVE_GRP_EQ_CONFIG attribute
will fail; on the destination side, the set_attr operation for the same
attribute will fail.

This adds tests for the existence of the OPAL get/set queue state
functions, and if they are not supported, the XIVE-native KVM device
is not created and the KVM_CAP_PPC_IRQ_XIVE capability returns false.
Userspace can then either provide a software emulation of XIVE, or
else tell the guest that it does not have a XIVE controller available
to it.
