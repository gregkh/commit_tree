misc: xilinx_sdfec: Fix a couple small information leaks

These structs have holes in them so we end up disclosing a few bytes of
uninitialized stack data.

drivers/misc/xilinx_sdfec.c:305 xsdfec_get_status() warn: check that 'status' doesn't leak information (struct has a hole after 'activity')
drivers/misc/xilinx_sdfec.c:449 xsdfec_get_turbo() warn: check that 'turbo_params' doesn't leak information (struct has a hole after 'scale')

We need to zero out the holes with memset().
