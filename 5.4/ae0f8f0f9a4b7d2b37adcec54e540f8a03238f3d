drm/i915/oa: update the generated files

Update the generated files to make the headers self-contained, switch to
the kernel preferred SPDX comment format, and update the copyright
year. Also add the Makefile stanza to run header tests on the files.

Other changes produced by gputop i915-perf-kernelgen.py were manually
stripped out, and left to the folks who actually know something about
the OA stuff.
