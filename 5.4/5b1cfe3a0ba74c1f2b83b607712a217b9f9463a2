arm64: smp: Don't enter kernel with NULL stack pointer or task struct

Although SMP bringup is inherently racy, we can significantly reduce
the window during which secondary CPUs can unexpectedly enter the
kernel by sanity checking the 'stack' and 'task' fields of the
'secondary_data' structure. If the booting CPU gave up waiting for us,
then they will have been cleared to NULL and we should spin in a WFE; WFI
loop instead.
