MAINTAINERS: Add an entry for generic architecture topology

arm and arm64 shared lot of CPU topology related code. This was
consolidated under driver/base/arch_topology.c by Juri. Now RISC-V
is also started sharing the same code pulling more code from arm64
into arch_topology.c

Since I was involved in the review from the beginning, I would like
to assume maintenance for the same.
