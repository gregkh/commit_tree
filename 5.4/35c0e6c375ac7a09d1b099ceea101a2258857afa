crypto: inside-secure - Base CD fetchcount on actual CD FIFO size

This patch derives the command descriptor fetch count from the actual
FIFO size advertised by the hardware. Fetching command descriptors
one at a time is a performance bottleneck for small blocks, especially
on hardware with multiple pipes. Even moreso if the HW has few rings.
