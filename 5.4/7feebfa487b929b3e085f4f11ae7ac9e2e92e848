test_firmware: add support for request_firmware_into_buf

Add test config into_buf to allow request_firmware_into_buf to be
called instead of request_firmware/request_firmware_direct.  The number
of parameters differ calling request_firmware_into_buf and support
has not been added to test such api in test_firmware until now.
