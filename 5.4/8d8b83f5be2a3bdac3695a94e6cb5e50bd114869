scsi: qla2xxx: Fix partial flash write of MBI

For new adapters with multiple flash regions to write to, current code
allows FW & Boot regions to be written, while other regions are blocked via
sysfs. The fix is to block all flash read/write through sysfs interface.

Fixes: e81d1bcbde06 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Further limit FLASH region write access from SysFS")
