platform/chrome: wilco_ec: Add batt_ppid_info command to telemetry driver

Add the GET_BATT_PPID_INFO=0x8A command to the allowlist of accepted
telemetry commands. In addition, since this new command requires
verifying the contents of some of the arguments, I also restructure
the request to use a union of the argument structs. Also, zero out the
request buffer before each request, and change "whitelist" to
"allowlist".
