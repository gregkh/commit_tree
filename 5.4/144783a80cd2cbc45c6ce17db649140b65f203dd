watchdog: imx2_wdt: fix min() calculation in imx2_wdt_set_timeout

Converting from ms to s requires dividing by 1000, not multiplying. So
this is currently taking the smaller of new_timeout and 1.28e8,
i.e. effectively new_timeout.

The driver knows what it set max_hw_heartbeat_ms to, so use that
value instead of doing a division at run-time.

FWIW, this can easily be tested by booting into a busybox shell and
doing "watchdog -t 5 -T 130 /dev/watchdog" - without this patch, the
watchdog fires after 130&127 == 2 seconds.
