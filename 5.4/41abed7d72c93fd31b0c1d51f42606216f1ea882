crypto: inside-secure - add support for arbitrary size hash/HMAC updates

This patch fixes an issue with hash and HMAC operations that perform
"large" intermediate updates (i.e. combined size > 2 hash blocks) by
actually making use of the hardware's hash continue capabilities.
The original implementation would cache these updates in a buffer that
was 2 hash blocks in size and fail if all update calls combined would
overflow that buffer. Which caused the cryptomgr extra tests to fail.
