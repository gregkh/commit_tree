sfc: don't score irq moderation points for GRO

We already scored points when handling the RX event, no-one else does this,
 and looking at the history it appears this was originally meant to only
 score on merges, not on GRO_NORMAL.  Moreover, it gets in the way of
 changing GRO to not immediately pass GRO_NORMAL skbs to the stack.
Performance testing with four TCP streams received on a single CPU (where
 throughput was line rate of 9.4Gbps in all tests) showed a 13.7% reduction
 in RX CPU usage (n=6, p=0.03).
