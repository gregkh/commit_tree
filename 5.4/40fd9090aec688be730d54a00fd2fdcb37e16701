drm/amd/display:Use Pixel clock in 100Hz units for HDMI Audio wall clock DTO

[Why]
-Pass and use pixel clock in 100 Hz to Audio for HDMI
audio DTO for Audio wall clock programming so audio DTO gets
increased precision for timings with /1001 factor.
-For HDMI TMDS for N and CTS ACR tables are based on 10 KHz
units, these does not need to be modified as N and CTS values
are still valid using current tables.
