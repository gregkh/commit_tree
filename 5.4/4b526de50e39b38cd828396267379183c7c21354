KVM: x86: Check kvm_rebooting in kvm_spurious_fault()

Explicitly check kvm_rebooting in kvm_spurious_fault() prior to invoking
BUG(), as opposed to assuming the caller has already done so.  Letting
kvm_spurious_fault() be called "directly" will allow VMX to better
optimize its low level assembly flows.

As a happy side effect, kvm_spurious_fault() no longer needs to be
marked as a dead end since it doesn't unconditionally BUG().
