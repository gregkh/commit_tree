ASoC: SOF: pcm: harden PCM STOP sequence

The old STOP sequence is: 1. stop DMA 2. send STOP ipc
If delay happen before the steps 1 and 2, the DMA buffer will be empty in
short time and cause pipeline xrun then stop the pipeline.
Then the step 2 ipc stop will return error as pipeline is already stopped.

Suggested change to avoid the issue is to switch the order of steps 1 and 2
for the stop sequence.
