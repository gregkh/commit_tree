net: devlink: remove redundant rtnl lock assert

It is enough for caller of devlink_compat_switch_id_get() to hold the net
device to guarantee that devlink port is not destroyed concurrently. Remove
rtnl lock assertion and modify comment to warn user that they must hold
either rtnl lock or reference to net device. This is necessary to
accommodate future implementation of rtnl-unlocked TC offloads driver
callbacks.
