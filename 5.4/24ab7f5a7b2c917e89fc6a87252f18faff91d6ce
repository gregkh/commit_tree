posix-cpu-timers: Consolidate thread group sample code

cpu_clock_sample_group() and cpu_timer_sample_group() are almost the
same. Before the rename one called thread_group_cputimer() and the other
thread_group_cputime(). Really intuitive function names.

Consolidate the functions and also avoid the thread traversal when
the thread group's accounting is already active.
