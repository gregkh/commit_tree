rtlwifi: rtl_pci: Fix memory leak when hardware init fails

If the call to hw_init() fails for any of the drivers, the driver will
leak memory that was allocated in BT coexistence setup. Technically, each
of the drivers should have done this free; however placing it in rtl_pci
fixes all the drivers with only a single patch.
