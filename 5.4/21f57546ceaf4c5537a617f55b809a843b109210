torture: Remove exporting of internal functions

The functions torture_onoff_cleanup() and torture_shuffle_cleanup()
are declared static and marked EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), which is at best an
odd combination.  Because these functions are not used outside of the
kernel/torture.c file they are defined in, this commit removes their
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() marking.
