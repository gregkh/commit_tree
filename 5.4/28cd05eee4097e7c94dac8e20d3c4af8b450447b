drm: kirin: Pass driver data to crtc init and plane init

As part of refactoring the kirin driver to better support
different hardware revisions, this patch changes the code
via a passed in driver_data pointer, rather than hardcoding
them via ade_driver_data variable.

This will allow those funcitons to be later moved to the
generic kirin_drm_drv.c using alternative driver_data structures
that support other hardware.
