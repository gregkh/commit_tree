ASoC: rsnd: don't call clk_get_rate() under atomic context

ADG is using clk_get_rate() under atomic context, thus, we might
have scheduling issue.
To avoid this issue, we need to get/keep clk rate under
non atomic context.

We need to handle ADG as special device at Renesas Sound driver.
From SW point of view, we want to impletent it as
rsnd_mod_ops :: prepare, but it makes code just complicate.

To avoid complicated code/patch, this patch adds new clk_rate[] array,
and keep clk IN rate when rsnd_adg_clk_enable() was called.
