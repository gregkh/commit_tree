RDMA/uverbs: Prevent potential underflow

The issue is in drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_std_types_cq.c in the
UVERBS_HANDLER(UVERBS_METHOD_CQ_CREATE) function.  We check that:

        if (attr.comp_vector >= attrs->ufile->device->num_comp_vectors) {

But we don't check if "attr.comp_vector" is negative.  It could
potentially lead to an array underflow.  My concern would be where
cq->vector is used in the create_cq() function from the cxgb4 driver.

And really "attr.comp_vector" is appears as a u32 to user space so that's
the right type to use.
