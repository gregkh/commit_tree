blk-mq: honor IO scheduler for multiqueue devices

If a device is using multiple queues, the IO scheduler may be bypassed.
This may hurt performance for some slow MQ devices, and it also breaks
zoned devices which depend on mq-deadline for respecting the write order
in one zone.

Don't bypass io scheduler if we have one setup.

This patch can double sequential write performance basically on MQ
scsi_debug when mq-deadline is applied.
