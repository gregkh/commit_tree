locking/rwsem: Check for operations on an uninitialized rwsem

Currently rwsems is the only locking primitive that lacks this
debug feature. Add it under CONFIG_DEBUG_RWSEMS and do the magic
checking in the locking fastpath (trylock) operation such that
we cover all cases. The unlocking part is pretty straightforward.
