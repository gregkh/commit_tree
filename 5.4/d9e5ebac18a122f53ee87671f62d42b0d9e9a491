Documentation: gpio: fix function links in the HTML docs

The shorthand [_data] and [devm_] cause the HTML documentation to not
link to the function documentation properly. This expands the references
to the complete function names with the exception of
devm_gpiochip_remove() which was dropped by commit 48207d7595d2 ("gpio:
drop devm_gpiochip_remove()").
