iwlwifi: pcie: fix memory leaks in iwl_pcie_ctxt_info_gen3_init

In iwl_pcie_ctxt_info_gen3_init there are cases that the allocated dma
memory is leaked in case of error.

DMA memories prph_scratch, prph_info, and ctxt_info_gen3 are allocated
and initialized to be later assigned to trans_pcie. But in any error case
before such assignment the allocated memories should be released.

First of such error cases happens when iwl_pcie_init_fw_sec fails.
Current implementation correctly releases prph_scratch. But in two
sunsequent error cases where dma_alloc_coherent may fail, such
releases are missing.

This commit adds release for prph_scratch when allocation for
prph_info fails, and adds releases for prph_scratch and prph_info when
allocation for ctxt_info_gen3 fails.
