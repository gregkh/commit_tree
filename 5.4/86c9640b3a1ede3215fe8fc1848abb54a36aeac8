drm/i915: Copy name string into ring buffer for intel_update/disable_plane tracepoints

Currently the intel_update_plane and intel_disable_plane tracepoints record
the address of plane->name in the ring buffer, and then when reading the
ring buffer uses %s to get the name. The issue with this, is that those two
events can be minutes, hours or even days apart. It is very dangerous to
dereference a string pointer without knowing if it still exists or not.

The proper way to handle this is to use the __string() macro in the
tracepoint which will save the string into the ring buffer at the time of
recording. Then there's no worries if the original string still exists in
memory when the ring buffer is read.
