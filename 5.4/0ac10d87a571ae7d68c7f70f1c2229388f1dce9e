tools arch x86: Sync asm/cpufeatures.h with the with the kernel

To pick up the changes in:

  f36cf386e3fe ("x86/speculation/swapgs: Exclude ATOMs from speculation through SWAPGS")
  18ec54fdd6d1 ("x86/speculation: Prepare entry code for Spectre v1 swapgs mitigations")

That don't affect anything in tools/.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h
