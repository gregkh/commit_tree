ARM: 8905/1: Emit __gnu_mcount_nc when using Clang 10.0.0 or newer

Currently, multi_v7_defconfig + CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER fails to build
with clang:

arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: kernel/softirq.o: in function `_local_bh_enable':
softirq.c:(.text+0x504): undefined reference to `mcount'
arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: kernel/softirq.o: in function `__local_bh_enable_ip':
softirq.c:(.text+0x58c): undefined reference to `mcount'
arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: kernel/softirq.o: in function `do_softirq':
softirq.c:(.text+0x6c8): undefined reference to `mcount'
arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: kernel/softirq.o: in function `irq_enter':
softirq.c:(.text+0x75c): undefined reference to `mcount'
arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: kernel/softirq.o: in function `irq_exit':
softirq.c:(.text+0x840): undefined reference to `mcount'
arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: kernel/softirq.o:softirq.c:(.text+0xa50): more undefined references to `mcount' follow

clang can emit a working mcount symbol, __gnu_mcount_nc, when
'-meabi gnu' is passed to it. Until r369147 in LLVM, this was
broken and caused the kernel not to boot with '-pg' because the
calling convention was not correct. Always build with '-meabi gnu'
when using clang but ensure that '-pg' (which is added with
CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER and its prereq CONFIG_HAVE_FUNCTION_TRACER)
cannot be added with it unless this is fixed (which means using
clang 10.0.0 and newer).
