mm, page_owner: rename flag indicating that page is allocated

Commit 37389167a281 ("mm, page_owner: keep owner info when freeing the
page") has introduced a flag PAGE_EXT_OWNER_ACTIVE to indicate that page
is tracked as being allocated.  Kirril suggested naming it
PAGE_EXT_OWNER_ALLOCATED to make it more clear, as "active is somewhat
loaded term for a page".
