libata/ahci: Fix PCS quirk application

Commit c312ef176399 "libata/ahci: Drop PCS quirk for Denverton and
beyond" got the polarity wrong on the check for which board-ids should
have the quirk applied. The board type board_ahci_pcs7 is defined at the
end of the list such that "pcs7" boards can be special cased in the
future if they need the quirk. All prior Intel board ids "<
board_ahci_pcs7" should proceed with applying the quirk.
