fs: ocfs2: fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ocfs2_write_end_nolock()

In ocfs2_write_end_nolock(), there are an if statement on lines 1976,
2047 and 2058, to check whether handle is NULL:

    if (handle)

When handle is NULL, it is used on line 2045:

	ocfs2_update_inode_fsync_trans(handle, inode, 1);
        oi->i_sync_tid = handle->h_transaction->t_tid;

Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.

To fix this bug, handle is checked before calling
ocfs2_update_inode_fsync_trans().

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
