drm/i915: Forgo last_fence active request tracking

We were using the last_fence to track the last request that used this
vma that might be interpreted by a fence register and forced ourselves
to wait for this request before modifying any fence register that
overlapped our vma. Due to requirement that we need to track any XY_BLT
command, linear or tiled, this in effect meant that we have to track the
vma for its active lifespan anyway, so we can forgo the explicit
last_fence tracking and just use the whole vma->active.

Another solution would be to pipeline the register updates, and would
help resolve some long running stalls for gen3 (but only gen 2 and 3!)
