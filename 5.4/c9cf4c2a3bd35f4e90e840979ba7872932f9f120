drm/panel: Add driver for the Sharp LS037V7DW01 panel

This panel is used on the TI SDP3430 board.

The code is based on the omapdrm-specific panel-sharp-ls037v7dw01
driver.

v2:
- fix checkpatch warning (lcd == NULL) => (!lcd) (sam)
- drop __exit_p() from remove. It caused a build warning.
  And no other panel drivers needs this (sam)
