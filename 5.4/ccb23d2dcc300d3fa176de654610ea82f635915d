drm/i915/gt: Guard timeline pinning without relying on struct_mutex

In preparation for removing struct_mutex from around context retirement,
we need to make timeline pinning and unpinning safe. Since multiple
engines/contexts can share a single timeline, we cannot rely on
borrowing the context mutex (otherwise we could state that the timeline
is only pinned/unpinned inside the context pin/unpin and so guarded by
it). However, we only perform a sequence of atomic operations inside the
timeline pin/unpin and the sequence of those operations is safe for a
concurrent unpin / pin, so we can relax the struct_mutex requirement.
