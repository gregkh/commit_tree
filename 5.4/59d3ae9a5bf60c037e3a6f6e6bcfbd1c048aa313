ARM: remove Intel iop33x and iop13xx support

There are three families of IOP machines we support in Linux: iop32x
(which includes EP80219), iop33x and iop13xx (aka IOP34x aka WP8134x).

All products we support in the kernel are based on the first of these,
iop32x, the other families only ever supported the Intel reference
boards but no actual machine anyone could ever buy.

While one could clearly make them all three work in a single kernel
with some work, this takes the easy way out, removing the later two
platforms entirely, under the assumption that there are no remaining
users.

Earlier versions of OpenWRT and Debian both had support for iop32x
but not the others, and they both dropped iop32x as well in their 2015
releases.
