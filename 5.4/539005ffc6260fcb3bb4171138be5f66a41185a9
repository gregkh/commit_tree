i2c: iproc: Add full name of devicetree node to adapter name

Add the full name of the devicetree node to the adapter name.
Without this change, all adapters have the same name making it difficult
to distinguish between multiple instances.
The most obvious way to see this is to use the utility i2c_detect.
e.g. "i2c-detect -l"

Before
i2c-1 i2c Broadcom iProc I2C adapter I2C adapter
i2c-0 i2c Broadcom iProc I2C adapter I2C adapter

After
i2c-1 i2c Broadcom iProc (i2c@e0000) I2C adapter
i2c-0 i2c Broadcom iProc (i2c@b0000) I2C adapter

Now it is easy to figure out which adapter maps to a which DT node.
