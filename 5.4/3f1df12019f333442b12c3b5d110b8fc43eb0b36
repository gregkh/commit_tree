recordmcount: Rewrite error/success handling

Recordmcount uses setjmp/longjmp to manage control flow as
it reads and then writes the ELF file. This unusual control
flow is hard to follow and check in addition to being unlike
kernel coding style.

So we rewrite these paths to use regular return values to
indicate error/success. When an error or previously-completed object
file is found we return an error code following kernel
coding conventions -- negative error values and 0 for success when
we're not returning a pointer. We return NULL for those that fail
and return non-NULL pointers otherwise.

One oddity is already_has_rel_mcount -- there we use pointer comparison
rather than string comparison to differentiate between
previously-processed object files and returning the name of a text
section.
