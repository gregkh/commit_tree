perf tests: Fixes hang in zstd compression test by changing the source of random data

Running 'perf test' with zstd compression linked will hang at the test
'Zstd perf.data compression/decompression' because /dev/random blocks
reads until there is enough entropy. This means that the test will
appear to never complete unless the mouse is continually moved while
running it.
