ceph: fix RCU case handling in ceph_d_revalidate()

For RCU case ->d_revalidate() is called with rcu_read_lock() and
without pinning the dentry passed to it.  Which means that it
can't rely upon ->d_inode remaining stable; that's the reason
for d_inode_rcu(), actually.

Make sure we don't reload ->d_inode there.
