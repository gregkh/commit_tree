rcu/nocb: Remove deferred wakeup checks for extended quiescent states

The idea behind the checks for extended quiescent states at the end of
__call_rcu_nocb() is to handle cases where call_rcu() is invoked directly
from within an extended quiescent state, for example, from the idle loop.
However, this will result in a timer-mediated deferred wakeup, which
will cause the needed wakeup to happen within a jiffy or thereabouts.
There should be no forward-progress concerns, and if there are, the proper
response is to exit the extended quiescent state while executing the
endless blast of call_rcu() invocations, for example, using RCU_NONIDLE().
Given the more realistic case of an isolated call_rcu() invocation, there
should be no problem.

This commit therefore removes the checks for invoking call_rcu() within
an extended quiescent state for on no-CBs CPUs.
