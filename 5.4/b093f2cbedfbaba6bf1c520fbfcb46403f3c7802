powerpc/eeh: Introduce EEH edev logging macros

Now that struct eeh_dev includes the BDFN of it's PCI device, make use
of it to replace eeh_edev_info() with a set of dev_dbg()-style macros
that only need a struct edev.

With the BDFN available without the struct pci_dev, eeh_pci_name() is
now unnecessary, so remove it.

While only the "info" level function is used here, the others will be
used in followup work.
