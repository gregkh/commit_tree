cpuidle: play_idle: Increase the resolution to usec

The play_idle resolution is 1ms. The intel_powerclamp bases the idle
duration on jiffies. The idle injection API is also using msec based
duration but has no user yet.

Unfortunately, msec based time does not fit well when we want to
inject idle cycle precisely with shallow idle state.

In order to set the scene for the incoming idle injection user, move
the precision up to usec when calling play_idle.
