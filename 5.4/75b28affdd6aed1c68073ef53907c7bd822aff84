io_uring: allocate the two rings together

Both the sq and the cq rings have sizes just over a power of two, and
the sq ring is significantly smaller. By bundling them in a single
alllocation, we get the sq ring for free.

This also means that IORING_OFF_SQ_RING and IORING_OFF_CQ_RING now mean
the same thing. If we indicate this to userspace, we can save a mmap
call.
