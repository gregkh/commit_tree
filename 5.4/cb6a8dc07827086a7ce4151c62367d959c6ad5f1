ice: Fix VF configuration issues due to reset

This patch fixes a critical reset issue that resulting to the server
reboot when an Admin changes VF configuration on the host, for example
changing VF to Trusted/non_Trusted mode, the PF driver send reset
notification to AVF driver while also continue with reset flow. However,
AVF driver schedule another reset due to notification, which causes two
concurrent reset going on, and trigger lock up in the FW, with AQ call to
delete VSI.
