drm/i915: Whitelist COMMON_SLICE_CHICKEN2

This allows userspace to use "legacy" mode for push constants, where
they are committed at 3DPRIMITIVE or flush time, rather than being
committed at 3DSTATE_BINDING_TABLE_POINTERS_XS time.  Gen6-8 and Gen11
both use the "legacy" behavior - only Gen9 works in the "new" way.

Conflating push constants with binding tables is painful for userspace,
we would like to be able to avoid doing so.
