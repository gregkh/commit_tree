xen: Stop abusing DT of_dma_configure API

As the removed comments say, these aren't DT based devices.
of_dma_configure() is going to stop allowing a NULL DT node and calling
it will no longer work.

The comment is also now out of date as of commit 9ab91e7c5c51 ("arm64:
default to the direct mapping in get_arch_dma_ops"). Direct mapping
is now the default rather than dma_dummy_ops.

According to Stefano and Oleksandr, the only other part needed is
setting the DMA masks and there's no reason to restrict the masks to
32-bits. So set the masks to 64 bits.
