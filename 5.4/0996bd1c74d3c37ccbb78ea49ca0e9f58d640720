habanalabs: display card name as sensors header

To allow the user to use a custom file for the HWMON lm-sensors library
per card type, the driver needs to register the HWMON sensors with the
specific card type name.

The card name is supplied by the F/W running on the device. If the F/W is
old and doesn't supply a card name, a default card name is displayed as
the sensors group name.
