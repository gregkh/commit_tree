perf/x86/intel/pt: Split ToPA metadata and page layout

PT uses page sized ToPA tables, where the ToPA table resides at the bottom
and its driver-specific metadata taking up a few words at the top of the
page. The split is currently calculated manually and needs to be redone
every time a field is added to or removed from the metadata structure.
Also, the 32-bit version can be made smaller.

By splitting the table and metadata into separate structures, we are making
the compiler figure out the division of the page.
