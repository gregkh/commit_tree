9p: Fill min and max timestamps in sb

struct p9_wstat and struct p9_stat_dotl indicate that the
wire transport uses u32 and u64 fields for timestamps.
Fill in the appropriate limits to avoid inconsistencies in
the vfs cached inode times when timestamps are outside the
permitted range.

Note that the upper bound for V9FS_PROTO_2000L is retained as S64_MAX.
This is because that is the upper bound supported by vfs.
