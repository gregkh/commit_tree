taprio: don't reject same mqprio settings

The taprio qdisc allows to set mqprio setting but only once. In case
if mqprio settings are provided next time the error is returned as
it's not allowed to change traffic class mapping in-flignt and that
is normal. But if configuration is absolutely the same - no need to
return error. It allows to provide same command couple times,
changing only base time for instance, or changing only scheds maps,
but leaving mqprio setting w/o modification. It more corresponds the
message: "Changing the traffic mapping of a running schedule is not
supported", so reject mqprio if it's really changed.

Also corrected TC_BITMASK + 1 for consistency, as proposed.
