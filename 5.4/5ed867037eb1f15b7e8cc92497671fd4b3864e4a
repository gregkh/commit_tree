mm/sparse.c: remove NULL check in clear_hwpoisoned_pages()

There is no possibility for memmap to be NULL in the current codebase.

This check was added in commit 95a4774d055c ("memory-hotplug: update
mce_bad_pages when removing the memory") where memmap was originally
inited to NULL, and only conditionally given a value.

The code that could have passed a NULL has been removed by commit
ba72b4c8cf60 ("mm/sparsemem: support sub-section hotplug"), so there is no
longer a possibility that memmap can be NULL.
