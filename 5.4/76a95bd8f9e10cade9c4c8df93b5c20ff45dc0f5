crypto: ccree - account for TEE not ready to report

When ccree driver runs it checks the state of the Trusted Execution
Environment CryptoCell driver before proceeding. We did not account
for cases where the TEE side is not ready or not available at all.
Fix it by only considering TEE error state after sync with the TEE
side driver.
