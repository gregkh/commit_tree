net/mlx5: fix -Wtype-limits compilation warnings

The commit b9a7ba556207 ("net/mlx5: Use event mask based on device
capabilities") introduced a few compilation warnings due to it bumps
MLX5_EVENT_TYPE_MAX from 0x27 to 0x100 which is always greater than
an "struct {mlx5_eqe|mlx5_nb}.type" that is an "u8".

  if (nb->event_type >= MLX5_EVENT_TYPE_MAX)

Fix them by removing unnecessary checkings.
