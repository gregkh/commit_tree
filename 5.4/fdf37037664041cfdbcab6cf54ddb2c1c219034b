btf: do not use CONFIG_OUTPUT_FORMAT

Building s390 kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF fails, because
CONFIG_OUTPUT_FORMAT is not defined. As a matter of fact, this variable
appears to be x86-only, so other arches might be affected as well.

Fix by obtaining this value from objdump output, just like it's already
done for bin_arch. The exact objdump invocation is "inspired" by
arch/powerpc/boot/wrapper.

Also, use LANG=C for the existing bin_arch objdump invocation to avoid
potential build issues on systems with non-English locale.
