cpuidle-haltpoll: set haltpoll as preferred governor

Right now, guest current governors have the following ratings:

 * ladder            -> 10
 * teo               -> 19
 * menu              -> 20
 * haltpoll          -> 21
 * ladder + nohz=off -> 25

haltpoll governor got introduced and it is now the default governor given
its highest rating -- with ladder+nohz being the exception -- regardless of
idle driver in the guest. An example of an undesirable case is x86 KVM
guests with MWAIT which have intel_idle registered first, and consequently
will have haltpoll be used as governor which would get limited to a poll
state and state 1 and the other states wouldn't get used.

To keep the previous defaults we decrease rating of governor to 9 (below
current lowest rating) and thus rely on @governor switch on
cpuidle_register_driver() to tie in haltpoll idle driver and governor
together.
