arm64: cpufeature: Treat ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 as RAZ when SVE is not enabled

If CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=n then we fail to report ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 as 0 when
read by userspace, despite being required by the architecture. Although
this is theoretically a change in ABI, userspace will first check for
the presence of SVE via the HWCAP or the ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.SVE field
before probing the ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 register. Given that these are
reported correctly for this configuration, we can safely tighten up the
current behaviour.

Ensure ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 is treated as RAZ when CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=n.
