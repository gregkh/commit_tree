ASoC: soc-core: rename soc_post_component_init() to soc_rtd_init()

It is easy to read code if it is cleanly using paired function/naming,
like start <-> stop, register <-> unregister, etc, etc.
But, current ALSA SoC code is very random, unbalance, not paired, etc.
It is easy to create bug at the such code, and it will be difficult to
debug.

From function name point of view, "soc_post_component_init()" sounds
like "component initialize function".
But in reality it is rtd setup function.

This patch renames soc_post_component_init() to soc_rtd_init()
