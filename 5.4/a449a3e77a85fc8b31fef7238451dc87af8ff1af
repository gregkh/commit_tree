net: sched: notify classifier on successful offload add/delete

To remove dependency on rtnl lock, extend classifier ops with new
ops->hw_add() and ops->hw_del() callbacks. Call them from cls API while
holding cb_lock every time filter if successfully added to or deleted from
hardware.

Implement the new API in flower classifier. Use it to manage hw_filters
list under cb_lock protection, instead of relying on rtnl lock to
synchronize with concurrent fl_reoffload() call.
