arm64: mm: Introduce VA_BITS_MIN

In order to support 52-bit kernel addresses detectable at boot time, the
kernel needs to know the most conservative VA_BITS possible should it
need to fall back to this quantity due to lack of hardware support.

A new compile time constant VA_BITS_MIN is introduced in this patch and
it is employed in the KASAN end address, KASLR, and EFI stub.

For Arm, if 52-bit VA support is unavailable the fallback is to 48-bits.

In other words: VA_BITS_MIN = min (48, VA_BITS)
