arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-main: Add hwspinlock node

The Main NavSS block on J721E SoCs contains a HwSpinlock IP instance that
is same as the IP on AM65x SoCs and similar to the IP on some OMAP SoCs.
Add the DT node for this on J721E SoCs. The node is present within the
Main NavSS block, and is added as a child node under the cbass_main_navss
interconnect node.
