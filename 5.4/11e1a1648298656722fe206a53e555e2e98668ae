opp: Don't decrement uninitialized list_kref

The list_kref was added for static OPPs and to track their users. The
kref is initialized while the static OPPs are added, but removed
unconditionally even if the static OPPs were never added. This causes
refcount mismatch warnings currently.

Fix that by always initializing the kref when the OPP table is first
initialized. The refcount is later incremented only for the second user
onwards.
