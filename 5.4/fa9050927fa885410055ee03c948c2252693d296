brcmfmac: allow 160MHz in custom regulatory rules

The driver has custom regulatory rules which had maximum bandwidth
for 5GHz channels set to 80MHz. As a consequence the driver can
not use 160MHz in AP mode even when the device supports it. So
relax the rules allowing 160MHz. After wiphy_register() the channel
flags are updated according what the device actually supports.
