drm/rockchip: Use the helpers for PSR

Instead of rolling our own implementation for tracking when PSR should
be [in]active, use the new self refresh helpers to do the heavy lifting.

Changes in v2:
- updated to reflect changes made in the helpers
Changes in v3:
- use the new atomic hooks to inspect crtc state instead of needing conn state (Daniel)
Changes in v4:
- Use Laurent's get_new_connector_for_encoder helper (Daniel)
- Exit vop disable early if it's already off
Changes in v5:
- Rebase on latest drm-misc-next
- Resolve conflict with s/edp_vsc_psr/dp_sdp/ rename
- Resolve conflict with drm_atomic.h header inclusion
