f2fs: add a condition to detect overflow in f2fs_ioc_gc_range()

end = range.start + range.len;

If the range.start/range.len is a very large value, then end can overflow
in this operation. It results into a crash in get_valid_blocks() when
accessing the invalid range.start segno.

This issue is reported in ioctl fuzz testing.
