clk: imx: pll14xx: avoid glitch when set rate

According to PLL1443XA and PLL1416X spec,
"When BYPASS is 0 and RESETB is changed from 0 to 1, FOUT starts to
output unstable clock until lock time passes. PLL1416X/PLL1443XA may
generate a glitch at FOUT."

So set BYPASS when RESETB is changed from 0 to 1 to avoid glitch.
In the end of set rate, BYPASS will be cleared.

When prepare clock, also need to take care to avoid glitch. So
we also follow Spec to set BYPASS before RESETB changed from 0 to 1.
And add a check if the RESETB is already 0, directly return 0;
