net/tls: clean up the number of #ifdefs for CONFIG_TLS_DEVICE

TLS code has a number of #ifdefs which make the code a little
harder to follow. Recent fixes removed the ifdef around the
TLS_HW define, so we can switch to the often used pattern
of defining tls_device functions as empty static inlines
in the header when CONFIG_TLS_DEVICE=n.
