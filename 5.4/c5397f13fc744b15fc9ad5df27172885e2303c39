scsi: ufs: Do not reset error history during host reset

Currently UFS error history will be reset and lost during host reset flow
by ufschd_probe_hba().

Avoid resetting it so error history can be kept as complete as possible to
improve debugging.

In addition, fix a minor display error in ufshcd_print_err_hist().
