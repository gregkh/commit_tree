drm/i915/uc: Use -EIO code for GuC initialization failures

Since commit 6ca9a2beb54a ("drm/i915: Unwind i915_gem_init() failure")
we believed that we correctly handle all errors encountered during
GuC initialization, including special one that indicates request to
run driver with disabled GPU submission (-EIO).

Unfortunately since commit 121981fafe69 ("drm/i915/guc: Combine
enable_guc_loading|submission modparams") we stopped using that
error code to avoid unwanted fallback to execlist submission mode.

In result any GuC initialization failure was treated as non-recoverable
error leading to driver load abort, so we could not even read related
GuC error log to investigate cause of the problem.

For now always return -EIO on any uC hardware related failure.
