netfilter: add missing IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NF_TABLES) check to header-file.

nf_tables.h defines an API comprising several inline functions and
macros that depend on the nft member of struct net.  However, this is
only defined is CONFIG_NF_TABLES is enabled.  Added preprocessor checks
to ensure that nf_tables.h will compile if CONFIG_NF_TABLES is disabled.
