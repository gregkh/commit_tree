arm64: dts: meson-sm1-sei610: add USB support

Add the USB properties for the Amlogic SM1 Based SEI610 Board in order to
support the USB DRD Type-C port and the USB3 Type A port.

The USB DRD Type-C controller uses the ID signal to toggle the USB role
between the DWC3 Host controller and the DWC2 Device controller.
