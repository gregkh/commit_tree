drm/i915/execlists: Minimalistic timeslicing

If we have multiple contexts of equal priority pending execution,
activate a timer to demote the currently executing context in favour of
the next in the queue when that timeslice expires. This enforces
fairness between contexts (so long as they allow preemption -- forced
preemption, in the future, will kick those who do not obey) and allows
us to avoid userspace blocking forward progress with e.g. unbounded
MI_SEMAPHORE_WAIT.

For the starting point here, we use the jiffie as our timeslice so that
we should be reasonably efficient wrt frequent CPU wakeups.
