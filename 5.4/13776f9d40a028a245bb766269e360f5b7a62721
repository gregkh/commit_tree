arm64: mm: free the initrd reserved memblock in a aligned manner

We should free the initrd reserved memblock in an aligned manner,
because the initrd reserves the memblock in an aligned manner
in arm64_memblock_init().
Otherwise there are some fragments in memblock_reserved regions
after free_initrd_mem(). e.g.:
/sys/kernel/debug/memblock # cat reserved
   0: 0x0000000080080000..0x00000000817fafff
   1: 0x0000000083400000..0x0000000083ffffff
   2: 0x0000000090000000..0x000000009000407f
   3: 0x00000000b0000000..0x00000000b000003f
   4: 0x00000000b26184ea..0x00000000b2618fff
The fragments like the ranges from b0000000 to b000003f and
from b26184ea to b2618fff should be freed.

And we can do free_reserved_area() after memblock_free(),
as free_reserved_area() calls __free_pages(), once we've done
that it could be allocated somewhere else,
but memblock and iomem still say this is reserved memory.
