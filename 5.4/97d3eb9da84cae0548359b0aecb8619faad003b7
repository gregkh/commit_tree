cpuidle-haltpoll: vcpu hotplug support

When cpus != maxcpus cpuidle-haltpoll will fail to register all vcpus
past the online ones and thus fail to register the idle driver.
This is because cpuidle_add_sysfs() will return with -ENODEV as a
consequence from get_cpu_device() return no device for a non-existing
CPU.

Instead switch to cpuidle_register_driver() and manually register each
of the present cpus through cpuhp_setup_state() callbacks and future
ones that get onlined or offlined. This mimmics similar logic that
intel_idle does.
