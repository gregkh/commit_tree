rcu/sync: Remove custom check for RCU readers

The rcu/sync code currently does a special check for being in an RCU
read-side critical section.  With RCU consolidating flavors and the
generic helper added earlier in this series, this check is no longer need.
This commit switches to the generic helper, saving a couple of lines
of code.
