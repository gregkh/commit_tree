i2c: icy: Add LTC2990 present on 2019 board revision

Since the 2019 a1k.org community re-print of these PCBs sports an
LTC2990 hwmon chip as an example use case, let this driver autoprobe
for that as well. If it is present, modprobing ltc2990 is sufficient.

The property_entry enables the three additional inputs available on
this particular board:

  in1 will be the voltage of the 5V rail, divided by 2.
  in2 will be the voltage of the 12V rail, divided by 4.
  temp3 will be measured using a PCB loop next the chip.
