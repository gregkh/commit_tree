ALSA: hda: Remove page allocation redirection

The HD-audio core allocates and releases pages via driver's specific
dma_alloc_pages and dma_free_pages ops defined in bus->io_ops.  This
was because some platforms require the uncached pages and the handling
of page flags had to be done locally in the driver code.

Since the recent change in ALSA core memory allocator, we can simply
pass SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_UC for the uncached pages, and the only
difference became about this type to be passed to the core allocator.
That is, it's good time for cleaning up the mess.

This patch changes the allocation code in HD-audio core to call the
core allocator directly so that we get rid of dma_alloc_pages and
dma_free_pages io_ops.  If a driver needs the uncached pages, it has
to set bus->dma_type right after the bus initialization.

This is merely a code refactoring and shouldn't bring any behavior
changes.
