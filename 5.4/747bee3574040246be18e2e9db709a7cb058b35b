dt-bindings: i2c: i2c-emev2: Rename bindings documentation file

Rename the bindings documentation file for Renesas EMEV2 IIC controller
from i2c-emev2.txt to renesas,iic-emev2.txt.

This is part of an ongoing effort to name bindings documentation files for
Renesas IP blocks consistently, in line with the compat strings they
document.
