drm/i915: Introduce struct intel_gt as replacement for anonymous i915->gt

We have long been slighlty annoyed by the anonymous i915->gt.

Promote it to a separate structure and give it its own header.

This is a first step towards cleaning up the separation between
i915 and gt.

v2:
 * Adjust SPDX header.
