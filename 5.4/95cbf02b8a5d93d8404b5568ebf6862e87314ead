drm/aspeed: gfc_crtc: Make structure aspeed_gfx_funcs constant

The static structure aspeed_gfx_funcs, of type
drm_simple_display_pipe_funcs, is used only as an argument to
drm_simple_display_pipe_init(), which does not modify it. Hence make it
constant to protect it from unintended modification.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
