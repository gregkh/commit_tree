crypto: caam - fix MDHA key derivation for certain user key lengths

Fuzz testing uncovered an issue when |user key| > |derived key|.
Derived key generation has to be fixed in two cases:

1. Era >= 6 (DKP is available)
DKP cannot be used with immediate input key if |user key| > |derived key|,
since the resulting descriptor (after DKP execution) would be invalid -
having a few bytes from user key left in descriptor buffer
as incorrect opcodes.

Fix DKP usage both in standalone hmac and in authenc algorithms.
For authenc the logic is simplified, by always storing both virtual
and dma key addresses.

2. Era < 6
The same case (|user key| > |derived key|) fails when DKP
is not available.
Make sure gen_split_key() dma maps max(|user key|, |derived key|),
since this is an in-place (bidirectional) operation.
