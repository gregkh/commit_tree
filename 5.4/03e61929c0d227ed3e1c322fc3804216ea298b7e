arm64: dts: rockchip: limit clock rate of MMC controllers for RK3328

150MHz is a fundamental limitation of RK3328 Soc, w/o this limitation,
eMMC, for instance, will run into 200MHz clock rate in HS200 mode, which
makes the RK3328 boards not always boot properly. By adding it in
rk3328.dtsi would also obviate the worry of missing it when adding new
boards.
