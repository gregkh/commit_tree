KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: use smp_mb() when setting/clearing host_ipi flag

On a 2-socket Power9 system with 32 cores/128 threads (SMT4) and 1TB
of memory running the following guest configs:

  guest A:
    - 224GB of memory
    - 56 VCPUs (sockets=1,cores=28,threads=2), where:
      VCPUs 0-1 are pinned to CPUs 0-3,
      VCPUs 2-3 are pinned to CPUs 4-7,
      ...
      VCPUs 54-55 are pinned to CPUs 108-111

  guest B:
    - 4GB of memory
    - 4 VCPUs (sockets=1,cores=4,threads=1)

with the following workloads (with KSM and THP enabled in all):

  guest A:
    stress --cpu 40 --io 20 --vm 20 --vm-bytes 512M

  guest B:
    stress --cpu 4 --io 4 --vm 4 --vm-bytes 512M

  host:
    stress --cpu 4 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 256M

the below soft-lockup traces were observed after an hour or so and
persisted until the host was reset (this was found to be reliably
reproducible for this configuration, for kernels 4.15, 4.18, 5.0,
and 5.3-rc5):

CPUs 45, 24, and 124 are stuck on spin locks, likely held by
CPUs 105 and 31.

CPUs 105 and 31 are stuck in smp_call_function_many(), waiting on
target CPU 42. For instance:

It was subsequently found that ipi_message[PPC_MSG_CALL_FUNCTION]
was set for CPU 42 by at least 1 of the CPUs waiting in
smp_call_function_many(), but somehow the corresponding
call_single_queue entries were never processed by CPU 42, causing the
callers to spin in csd_lock_wait() indefinitely.

Nick Piggin suggested something similar to the following sequence as
a possible explanation (interleaving of CALL_FUNCTION/RESCHEDULE
IPI messages seems to be most common, but any mix of CALL_FUNCTION and
!CALL_FUNCTION messages could trigger it):

    CPU
      X: smp_muxed_ipi_set_message():
      X:   smp_mb()
      X:   message[RESCHEDULE] = 1
      X: doorbell_global_ipi(42):
      X:   kvmppc_set_host_ipi(42, 1)
      X:   ppc_msgsnd_sync()/smp_mb()
      X:   ppc_msgsnd() -> 42
     42: doorbell_exception(): // from CPU X
     42:   ppc_msgsync()
    105: smp_muxed_ipi_set_message():
    105:   smb_mb()
         // STORE DEFERRED DUE TO RE-ORDERING
  --105:   message[CALL_FUNCTION] = 1
  | 105: doorbell_global_ipi(42):
  | 105:   kvmppc_set_host_ipi(42, 1)
  |  42:   kvmppc_set_host_ipi(42, 0)
  |  42: smp_ipi_demux_relaxed()
  |  42: // returns to executing guest
  |      // RE-ORDERED STORE COMPLETES
  ->105:   message[CALL_FUNCTION] = 1
    105:   ppc_msgsnd_sync()/smp_mb()
    105:   ppc_msgsnd() -> 42
     42: local_paca->kvm_hstate.host_ipi == 0 // IPI ignored
    105: // hangs waiting on 42 to process messages/call_single_queue

This can be prevented with an smp_mb() at the beginning of
kvmppc_set_host_ipi(), such that stores to message[<type>] (or other
state indicated by the host_ipi flag) are ordered vs. the store to
to host_ipi.

However, doing so might still allow for the following scenario (not
yet observed):

    CPU
      X: smp_muxed_ipi_set_message():
      X:   smp_mb()
      X:   message[RESCHEDULE] = 1
      X: doorbell_global_ipi(42):
      X:   kvmppc_set_host_ipi(42, 1)
      X:   ppc_msgsnd_sync()/smp_mb()
      X:   ppc_msgsnd() -> 42
     42: doorbell_exception(): // from CPU X
     42:   ppc_msgsync()
         // STORE DEFERRED DUE TO RE-ORDERING
  -- 42:   kvmppc_set_host_ipi(42, 0)
  |  42: smp_ipi_demux_relaxed()
  | 105: smp_muxed_ipi_set_message():
  | 105:   smb_mb()
  | 105:   message[CALL_FUNCTION] = 1
  | 105: doorbell_global_ipi(42):
  | 105:   kvmppc_set_host_ipi(42, 1)
  |      // RE-ORDERED STORE COMPLETES
  -> 42:   kvmppc_set_host_ipi(42, 0)
     42: // returns to executing guest
    105:   ppc_msgsnd_sync()/smp_mb()
    105:   ppc_msgsnd() -> 42
     42: local_paca->kvm_hstate.host_ipi == 0 // IPI ignored
    105: // hangs waiting on 42 to process messages/call_single_queue

Fixing this scenario would require an smp_mb() *after* clearing
host_ipi flag in kvmppc_set_host_ipi() to order the store vs.
subsequent processing of IPI messages.

To handle both cases, this patch splits kvmppc_set_host_ipi() into
separate set/clear functions, where we execute smp_mb() prior to
setting host_ipi flag, and after clearing host_ipi flag. These
functions pair with each other to synchronize the sender and receiver
sides.

With that change in place the above workload ran for 20 hours without
triggering any lock-ups.
