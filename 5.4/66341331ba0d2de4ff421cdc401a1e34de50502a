nvme-pci: Add support for Apple 2018+ models

Based on reverse engineering and original patch by

Paul Pawlowski <paul@mrarm.io>

This adds support for Apple weird implementation of NVME in their
2018 or later machines. It accounts for the twice-as-big SQ entries
for the IO queues, and the fact that only interrupt vector 0 appears
to function properly.
