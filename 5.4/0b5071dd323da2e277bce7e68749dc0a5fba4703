shmem_parse_options(): use a separate structure to keep the results

... and copy the data from it into sbinfo in the callers.
For use by remount we need to keep track whether there'd
been options setting max_inodes, max_blocks and huge resp.
and do the sanity checks (and copying) only if such options
had been seen.  uid/gid/mode is ignored by remount and
NULL mpol is already explicitly treated as "ignore it",
so we don't need to keep track of those.

Note: theoretically, mpol_parse_string() may return NULL
not in case of error (for default policy), so the assumption
that NULL mpol means "change nothing" is incorrect.  However,
that's the mainline behaviour and any changes belong in
a separate patch.  If we go for that, we'll need to keep
track of having encountered mpol= option too.
