iwlwifi: dbg_ini: remove apply point, switch to time point API

Remove the "apply points" mechanism as preparation for the changed
debug API where this is now a "time point" instead. Use a new API
across the code at the trigger points ("time points"), but don't
yet implement it since that requires some more preparation.
