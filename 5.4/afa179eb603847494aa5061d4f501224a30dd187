dm: introduce DM_GET_TARGET_VERSION

This commit introduces a new ioctl DM_GET_TARGET_VERSION. It will load a
target that is specified in the "name" entry in the parameter structure
and return its version.

This functionality is intended to be used by cryptsetup, so that it can
query kernel capabilities before activating the device.
