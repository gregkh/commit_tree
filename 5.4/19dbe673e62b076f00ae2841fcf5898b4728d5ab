powerpc/64s/exception: machine check fix KVM guest test

The machine_check_handle_early hypervisor guest test is skipped if
!HVMODE or MSR[HV]=0, which is wrong for PR or nested hypervisors
that could be running a guest in this state.

Test HSTATE_IN_GUEST up front and use that to branch out to the KVM
handler, then MSR[PR] alone can test for this kernel's userspace.
This matches all other interrupt handling.
