parisc: Disable HP HSC-PCI Cards to prevent kernel crash

The HP Dino PCI controller chip can be used in two variants: as on-board
controller (e.g. in B160L), or on an Add-On card ("Card-Mode") to bridge
PCI components to systems without a PCI bus, e.g. to a HSC/GSC bus.  One
such Add-On card is the HP HSC-PCI Card which has one or more DEC Tulip
PCI NIC chips connected to the on-card Dino PCI controller.

Dino in Card-Mode has a big disadvantage: All PCI memory accesses need
to go through the DINO_MEM_DATA register, so Linux drivers will not be
able to use the ioremap() function. Without ioremap() many drivers will
not work, one example is the tulip driver which then simply crashes the
kernel if it tries to access the ports on the HP HSC card.

This patch disables the HP HSC card if it finds one, and as such
fixes the kernel crash on a HP D350/2 machine.
