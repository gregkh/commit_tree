s390/idle: fix cpu idle time calculation

The idle time reported in /proc/stat sometimes incorrectly contains
huge values on s390. This is caused by a bug in arch_cpu_idle_time().

The kernel tries to figure out when a different cpu entered idle by
accessing its per-cpu data structure. There is an ordering problem: if
the remote cpu has an idle_enter value which is not zero, and an
idle_exit value which is zero, it is assumed it is idle since
"now". The "now" timestamp however is taken before the idle_enter
value is read.

Which in turn means that "now" can be smaller than idle_enter of the
remote cpu. Unconditionally subtracting idle_enter from "now" can thus
lead to a negative value (aka large unsigned value).

Fix this by moving the get_tod_clock() invocation out of the
loop. While at it also make the code a bit more readable.

A similar bug also exists for show_idle_time(). Fix this is as well.
