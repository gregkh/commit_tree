scsi: qla2xxx: Fix message indicating vectors used by driver

This patch updates log message which indicates number of vectors used by
the driver instead of displaying failure to get maximum requested
vectors. Driver will always request maximum vectors during
initialization. In the event driver is not able to get maximum requested
vectors, it will adjust the allocated vectors. This is normal and does not
imply failure in driver.
