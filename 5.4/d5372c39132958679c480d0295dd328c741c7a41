kexec: restore arch_kexec_kernel_image_probe declaration

arch_kexec_kernel_image_probe function declaration has been removed by
commit 9ec4ecef0af7 ("kexec_file,x86,powerpc: factor out kexec_file_ops
functions").  Still this function is overridden by couple of architectures
and proper prototype declaration is therefore important, so bring it back.
This fixes the following sparse warning on s390:
arch/s390/kernel/machine_kexec_file.c:333:5: warning: symbol
'arch_kexec_kernel_image_probe' was not declared.  Should it be static?
