netfilter: ebtables: use __u8 instead of uint8_t in uapi header

When CONFIG_UAPI_HEADER_TEST=y, exported headers are compile-tested to
make sure they can be included from user-space.

Currently, linux/netfilter_bridge/ebtables.h is excluded from the test
coverage. To make it join the compile-test, we need to fix the build
errors attached below.

For a case like this, we decided to use __u{8,16,32,64} variable types
in this discussion:
