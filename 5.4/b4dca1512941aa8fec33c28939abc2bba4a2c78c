swiotlb-xen: simplify cache maintainance

Now that we know we always have the dma-noncoherent.h helpers available
if we are on an architecture with support for non-coherent devices,
we can just call them directly, and remove the calls to the dma-direct
routines, including the fact that we call the dma_direct_map_page
routines but ignore the value returned from it.  Instead we now have
Xen wrappers for the arch_sync_dma_for_{device,cpu} helpers that call
the special Xen versions of those routines for foreign pages.

Note that the new helpers get the physical address passed in addition
to the dma address to avoid another translation for the local cache
maintainance.  The pfn_valid checks remain on the dma address as in
the old code, even if that looks a little funny.
