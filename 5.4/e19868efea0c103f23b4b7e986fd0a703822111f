net/mlx4_core: Dynamically set guaranteed amount of counters per VF

Prior to this patch, the amount of counters guaranteed per VF in the
resource tracker was MLX4_VF_COUNTERS_PER_PORT * MLX4_MAX_PORTS. It was
set regardless if the VF was single or dual port.
This caused several VFs to have no guaranteed counters although the
system could satisfy their request.

The fix is to dynamically guarantee counters, based on each VF
specification.
