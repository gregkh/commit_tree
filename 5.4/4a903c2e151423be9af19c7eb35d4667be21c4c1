perf tools: Remove debug.h from places where it is not needed

Pruning a bit more the includes dependency tree. Building this thing on
lots of containers takes time, we better reduce the time per build, each
container is doing 6 builds when clang and clang-devel are available,
and the plan is to do a 'make -C tools/perf build-test' that have many
more.

Also helps when doing normal development, as touching some random file
will have a much reduced chance of triggering lots of rebuilds.
