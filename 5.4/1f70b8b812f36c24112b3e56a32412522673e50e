dma-fence: Propagate errors to dma-fence-array container

When one of the array of fences is signaled, propagate its errors to the
parent fence-array (keeping the first error to be raised).

v2: Opencode cmpxchg_local to avoid compiler freakout.
v3: Be careful not to flag an error if we race against signal-on-any.
v4: Same applies to installing the signal cb.
v5: Use cmpxchg to only set the error once before using a nifty idea by
Christian to avoid changing the status after emitting the signal.
