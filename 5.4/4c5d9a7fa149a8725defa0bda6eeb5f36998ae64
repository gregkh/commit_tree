i40e: fix xdp handle calculations

Currently, we don't add headroom to the handle in i40e_zca_free,
i40e_alloc_buffer_slow_zc and i40e_alloc_buffer_zc. The addition of the
headroom to the handle was removed in
commit 2f86c806a8a8 ("i40e: modify driver for handling offsets"), which
will break things when headroom is non-zero. This patch fixes this and uses
xsk_umem_adjust_offset to add it appropritely based on the mode being run.
