net/mlx5: FWTrace, Reduce stack usage

Mark mlx5_tracer_print_trace as noinline as the function only uses 512
bytes on the stack to avoid the following build warning:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/diag/fw_tracer.c:660:13: error: stack frame size of 1032 bytes in function 'mlx5_fw_tracer_handle_traces' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

Fixes: 70dd6fdb8987 ("net/mlx5: FW tracer, parse traces and kernel tracing support")
