r8169: disable TSO on a single version of RTL8168c to fix performance

During performance testing, I found that one of my r8169 NICs suffered
a major performance loss, a 8168c model.

Running netperf's TCP_STREAM test didn't return the expected
throughput of > 900 Mb/s, but rather only about 22 Mb/s.  Strange
enough, running the TCP_MAERTS and UDP_STREAM tests all returned with
throughput > 900 Mb/s, as did TCP_STREAM with the other r8169 NICs I can
test (either one of 8169s, 8168e, 8168f).

Bisecting turned up commit 93681cd7d94f83903cb3f0f95433d10c28a7e9a5,
"r8169: enable HW csum and TSO" as the culprit.

I added my 8168c version, RTL_GIGA_MAC_VER_22, to the code
special-casing the 8168evl as per the patch below.  This fixed the
performance problem for me.
