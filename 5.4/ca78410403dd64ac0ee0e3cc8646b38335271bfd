PCI: Get rid of dev->has_secondary_link flag

In some systems, the Device/Port Type in the PCI Express Capabilities
register incorrectly identifies upstream ports as downstream ports.

d0751b98dfa3 ("PCI: Add dev->has_secondary_link to track downstream PCIe
links") addressed this by adding pci_dev.has_secondary_link, which is set
for downstream ports.  But this is confusing because pci_pcie_type()
sometimes gives the wrong answer, and it's not obvious that we should use
pci_dev.has_secondary_link instead.

Reduce the confusion by correcting the type of the port itself so that
pci_pcie_type() returns the actual type regardless of what the Device/Port
Type register claims it is.  Update the users to call pci_pcie_type() and
pcie_downstream_port() accordingly, and remove pci_dev.has_secondary_link
completely.
