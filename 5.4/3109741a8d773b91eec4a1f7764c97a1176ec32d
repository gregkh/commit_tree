KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Use a single IO device per redistributor

At the moment we use 2 IO devices per GICv3 redistributor: one
one for the RD_base frame and one for the SGI_base frame.

Instead we can use a single IO device per redistributor (the 2
frames are contiguous). This saves slots on the KVM_MMIO_BUS
which is currently limited to NR_IOBUS_DEVS (1000).

This change allows to instantiate up to 512 redistributors and may
speed the guest boot with a large number of VCPUs.
