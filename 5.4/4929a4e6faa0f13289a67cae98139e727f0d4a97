sched/fair: Scale bandwidth quota and period without losing quota/period ratio precision

The quota/period ratio is used to ensure a child task group won't get
more bandwidth than the parent task group, and is calculated as:

  normalized_cfs_quota() = [(quota_us << 20) / period_us]

If the quota/period ratio was changed during this scaling due to
precision loss, it will cause inconsistency between parent and child
task groups.

See below example:

A userspace container manager (kubelet) does three operations:

 1) Create a parent cgroup, set quota to 1,000us and period to 10,000us.
 2) Create a few children cgroups.
 3) Set quota to 1,000us and period to 10,000us on a child cgroup.

These operations are expected to succeed. However, if the scaling of
147/128 happens before step 3, quota and period of the parent cgroup
will be changed:

  new_quota: 1148437ns,   1148us
 new_period: 11484375ns, 11484us

And when step 3 comes in, the ratio of the child cgroup will be
104857, which will be larger than the parent cgroup ratio (104821),
and will fail.

Scaling them by a factor of 2 will fix the problem.
