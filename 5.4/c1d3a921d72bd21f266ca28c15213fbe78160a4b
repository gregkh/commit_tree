ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Fix the MCLK and BCLK dividers on newer SoCs

From: Marcus Cooper <codekipper@gmail.com>

The clock division dividers have changed between the older (A10/A31) and
newer (H3, A64, etc) SoCs.

While this was addressed through an offset on some SoCs, it was missing
some dividers as well, so the support wasn't perfect. Let's introduce a
pointer in the quirk structure for the divider calculation functions to use
so we can have the proper range now.
