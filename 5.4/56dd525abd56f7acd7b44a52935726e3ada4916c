sctp: add SCTP_AUTH_SUPPORTED sockopt

SCTP_AUTH_SUPPORTED sockopt is used to set enpoint's auth
flag. With this feature, each endpoint will have its own
flag for its future asoc's auth_capable, instead of netns
auth flag.

Note that when both ep's auth_enable is enabled, endpoint
auth related data should be initialized. If asconf_enable
is also set, SCTP_CID_ASCONF/SCTP_CID_ASCONF_ACK should
be added into auth_chunk_list.
