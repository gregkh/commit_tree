rbtree: avoid generating code twice for the cached versions (tools copy)

As was already noted in rbtree.h, the logic to cache rb_first (or
rb_last) can easily be implemented externally to the core rbtree api.

This commit takes the changes applied to the include/linux/ and lib/
rbtree files in 9f973cb38088 ("lib/rbtree: avoid generating code twice
for the cached versions"), and applies these to the
tools/include/linux/ and tools/lib/ files as well to keep them
synchronized.
