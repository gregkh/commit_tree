rtc: mxc: use spin_lock_irqsave instead of spin_lock_irq in IRQ context

As spin_unlock_irq will enable interrupts.
mxc_rtc_irq_enable is called from interrupt handler mxc_rtc_interrupt.
Interrupts are enabled in interrupt handler.
Use spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_irqrestore instead of spin_(un)lock_irq
in IRQ context to avoid this.
