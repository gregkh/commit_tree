btrfs: refactor the ticket wakeup code

Now that btrfs_space_info_add_old_bytes simply checks if we can make the
reservation and updates bytes_may_use, there's no reason to have both
helpers in place.

Factor out the ticket wakeup logic into it's own helper, make
btrfs_space_info_add_old_bytes() update bytes_may_use and then call the
wakeup helper, and replace all calls to btrfs_space_info_add_new_bytes()
with the wakeup helper.
