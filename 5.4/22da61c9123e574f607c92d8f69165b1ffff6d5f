KVM: x86: Clean up handle_emulation_failure()

When handling emulation failure, return the emulation result directly
instead of capturing it in a local variable.  Future patches will move
additional cases into handle_emulation_failure(), clean up the cruft
before so there isn't an ugly mix of setting a local variable and
returning directly.
