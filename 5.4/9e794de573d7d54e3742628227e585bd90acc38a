staging: erofs: kill sbi->dev_name

As Al said, "the only use of sbi->dev_name is debugging
printks and all of those have sb->s_id available, with
device name stored in there.  Which makes the whole
thing bloody weird".

sbi->dev_name was used for our debugging use and it's
better to just use s_id in community and delete
the whole erofs_mount_private stuff.
