kvm: x86: Improve emulation of CPUID leaves 0BH and 1FH

For these CPUID leaves, the EDX output is not dependent on the ECX
input (i.e. the SIGNIFCANT_INDEX flag doesn't apply to
EDX). Furthermore, the low byte of the ECX output is always identical
to the low byte of the ECX input. KVM does not produce the correct ECX
and EDX outputs for any undefined subleaves beyond the first.

Special-case these CPUID leaves in kvm_cpuid, so that the ECX and EDX
outputs are properly generated for all undefined subleaves.
