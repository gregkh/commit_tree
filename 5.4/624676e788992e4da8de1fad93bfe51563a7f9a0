xdp: xdp_umem: replace kmap on vmap for umem map

For 64-bit there is no reason to use vmap/vunmap, so use page_address
as it was initially. For 32 bits, in some apps, like in samples
xdpsock_user.c when number of pgs in use is quite big, the kmap
memory can be not enough, despite on this, kmap looks like is
deprecated in such cases as it can block and should be used rather
for dynamic mm.
