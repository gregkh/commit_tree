USB: serial: ti_usb_3410_5052: fix port-close races

Fix races between closing a port and opening or closing another port on
the same device which could lead to a failure to start or stop the
shared interrupt URB. The latter could potentially cause a
use-after-free or worse in the completion handler on driver unbind.
