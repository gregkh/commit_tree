bpf: always allocate at least 16 bytes for setsockopt hook

Since we always allocate memory, allocate just a little bit more
for the BPF program in case it need to override user input with
bigger value. The canonical example is TCP_CONGESTION where
input string might be too small to override (nv -> bbr or cubic).

16 bytes are chosen to match the size of TCP_CA_NAME_MAX and can
be extended in the future if needed.
