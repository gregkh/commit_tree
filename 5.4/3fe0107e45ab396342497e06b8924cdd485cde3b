drm/i915/icl: whitelist PS_(DEPTH|INVOCATION)_COUNT

The same tests failing on CFL+ platforms are also failing on ICL.
Documentation doesn't list the
WaAllowPMDepthAndInvocationCountAccessFromUMD workaround for ICL but
applying it fixes the same tests as CFL.

v2: Use only one whitelist entry (Lionel)
