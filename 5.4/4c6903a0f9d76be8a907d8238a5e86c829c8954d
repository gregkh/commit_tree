KVM: x86: fix reporting of AMD speculation bug CPUID leaf

The AMD_* bits have to be set from the vendor-independent
feature and bug flags, because KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID does not care
about the vendor and they should be set on Intel processors as well.
On top of this, SSBD, STIBP and AMD_SSB_NO bit were not set, and
VIRT_SSBD does not have to be added manually because it is a
cpufeature that comes directly from the host's CPUID bit.
