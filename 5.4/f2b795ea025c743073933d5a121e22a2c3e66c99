net: sched: cls_matchall: cleanup flow_action before deallocating

Recent rtnl lock removal patch changed flow_action infra to require proper
cleanup besides simple memory deallocation. However, matchall classifier
was not updated to call tc_cleanup_flow_action(). Add proper cleanup to
mall_replace_hw_filter() and mall_reoffload().

Fixes: 5a6ff4b13d59 ("net: sched: take reference to action dev before calling offloads")
