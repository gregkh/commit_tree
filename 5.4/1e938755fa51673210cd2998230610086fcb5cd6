video: omapfb2: Make standard and custom panel drivers mutually exclusive

Standard DRM panel drivers for several panels used by omapfb2 are now
available. Their module name clashes with the modules from
drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/omapfb/displays, part of the deprecated omapfb2
fbdev driver. As omapfb2 can only be compiled when the omapdrm driver is
disabled, and the DRM panel drivers are useless in that case, make the
omapfb2 panels depend on the standard DRM panels being disabled to fix
the name clash.
