kbuild: Parameterize kallsyms generation and correct reporting

When kallsyms generation happens, temporary vmlinux outputs are linked
but the quiet make output didn't report it, giving the impression that
the prior command is taking longer than expected.

Instead, report the linking step explicitly. While at it, this
consolidates the repeated "kallsyms generation step" into a single
function and removes the existing copy/pasting.
