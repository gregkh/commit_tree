drm/connector: Fix warning in debug message

The commit 3aeeb13d8996 ("drm/modes: Support modes names on the command
line") added name support to the DRM modes, and added that name to the
debug message.

However, that code tests for whether or not the name variable is NULL and
only prints it if it's not. Except that that variable is an array, so it
will never be NULL.

The original intent was to print it only when the name has been specified.
Just printing the array directly will achieve the same thing since the
drm_cmdline_mode structure that holds it is itself contained in
drm_connector, that is allocated with its whole content zero'd.

That means that if the name is not declared, the array will be all zeros,
which will not print anything.
