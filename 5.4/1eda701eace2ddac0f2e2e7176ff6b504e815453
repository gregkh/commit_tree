drm/i915/gtt: Recursive cleanup for gen8

With an explicit level, we can refactor the separate cleanup functions
as a simple recursive function. We take the opportunity to pass down the
size of each level so that we can deal with the different sizes of
top-level and avoid over allocating for 32/36-bit vm.
