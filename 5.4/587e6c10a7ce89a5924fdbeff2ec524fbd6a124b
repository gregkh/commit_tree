iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Reduce contention during command-queue insertion

The SMMU command queue is a bottleneck in large systems, thanks to the
spin_lock which serialises accesses from all CPUs to the single queue
supported by the hardware.

Attempt to improve this situation by moving to a new algorithm for
inserting commands into the queue, which is lock-free on the fast-path.
