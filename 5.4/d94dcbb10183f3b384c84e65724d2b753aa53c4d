thunderbolt: Do not fail adding switch if some port is not implemented

There are two ways to mark a port as unimplemented. Typical way is to
return port type as TB_TYPE_INACTIVE when its config space is read.
Alternatively if the port is not physically present (such as ports 10
and 11 in ICL) reading from port config space returns
TB_CFG_ERROR_INVALID_CONFIG_SPACE instead. Currently the driver bails
out from adding the switch if it receives any error during port
inititialization which is wrong.

Handle this properly and just leave the port as TB_TYPE_INACTIVE before
continuing to the next port.

This also allows us to get rid of special casing for Light Ridge port 5
in eeprom.c.
