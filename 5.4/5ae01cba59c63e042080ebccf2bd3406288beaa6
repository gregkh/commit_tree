au1200fb: don't use DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT

au1200fb allocates DMA memory using DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT, but never
calls dma_cache_sync to synchronize the memory between the CPU and the
device.  If it was use on a not cache coherent bus that would be fatal,
but as far as I can tell from the naming and the mips platform
implementation it always is used in cache coherent systems.  Remove
the DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT flag, which is a no-op in that case.
