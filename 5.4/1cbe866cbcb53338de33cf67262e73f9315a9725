IB/core: Fix wrong iterating on ports

rdma_for_each_port is already incrementing the iterator's value it
receives therefore, after the first iteration the iterator is increased by
2 which eventually causing wrong queries and possible traces.

Fix the above by removing the old redundant incrementation that was used
before rdma_for_each_port() macro.
