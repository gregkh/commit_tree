media: i2c: tda1997x: prevent potential NULL pointer access

i2c_new_dummy() can fail returning a NULL pointer. This is not checked
and the returned pointer is blindly used. Convert to
devm_i2c_new_dummy_client() which returns an ERR_PTR and also add a
validity check. Using devm_* here also fixes a leak because the dummy
client was not released in the probe error path.
