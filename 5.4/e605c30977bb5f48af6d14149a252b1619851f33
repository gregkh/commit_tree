USB: atm: cxacru: convert to use dev_groups

USB drivers now support the ability for the driver core to handle the
creation and removal of device-specific sysfs files in a race-free
manner.  Take advantage of that by converting the driver to use this by
moving the sysfs attributes into a group and assigning the dev_groups
pointer to it.
