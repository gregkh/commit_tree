drm/amd/display: fix a potential null pointer dereference

Currently the pointer init_data is dereferenced on the assignment
of fw_info before init_data is sanity checked to see if it is null.
Fix te potential null pointer dereference on init_data by only
performing dereference after it is null checked.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference before null check")
