fm10k: fix fm10k_get_fault_pf to read correct address

Fix assignment of the FM10K_FAULT_ADDR_LO register into fault->address
by using a bit-wise |= operation. Without this, the low address is
completely overwriting the high potion of the address. This caused the
fault to incorrectly return only the lower 32 bits of the fault address.

This issue was detected by cppcheck and resolves the following warnings
produced by that tool:

[fm10k_pf.c:1668] -> [fm10k_pf.c:1670]: (style) Variable
'fault->address' is reassigned a value before the old one has been used.

[fm10k_pf.c:1669] -> [fm10k_pf.c:1670]: (style) Variable
'fault->address' is reassigned a value before the old one has been used.
