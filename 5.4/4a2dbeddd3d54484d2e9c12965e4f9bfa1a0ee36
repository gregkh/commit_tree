PCI/ACPI: Remove unnecessary struct hotplug_program_ops

Move the ACPI-specific structs hpx_type0, hpx_type1, hpx_type2 and
hpx_type3 to drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c as they are not used anywhere else.
Then remove the struct hotplug_program_ops that has been shared between
drivers/pci/probe.c and drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c from drivers/pci/pci.h as it
is no longer needed.

The struct hotplug_program_ops was added by 87fcf12e846a ("PCI/ACPI: Remove
the need for 'struct hotplug_params'") and replaced previously used struct
hotplug_params enabling the support for the _HPX Type 3 Setting Record that
was added by f873c51a155a ("PCI/ACPI: Implement _HPX Type 3 Setting
Record").

The new struct allowed for the static functions such program_hpx_type0(),
program_hpx_type1(), etc., from the drivers/pci/probe.c to be called from
the function pci_acpi_program_hp_params() in the drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c.

Previously a programming of _HPX Type 0 was as follows:

  drivers/pci/probe.c:

    program_hpx_type0()
    ...
    pci_configure_device()
      hp_ops = {
        .program_type0 = program_hpx_type0,
        ...
      }
      pci_acpi_program_hp_params(&hp_ops)

  drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:

    pci_acpi_program_hp_params(&hp_ops)
      acpi_run_hpx(hp_ops)
        decode_type0_hpx_record()
          hp_ops->program_type0     # program_hpx_type0() called via hp_ops

After the ACPI-specific functions, structs, enums, etc., have been moved to
drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c there is no need for the hotplug_program_ops as all
of the _HPX Type 0, 1, 2 and 3 are directly accessible.
