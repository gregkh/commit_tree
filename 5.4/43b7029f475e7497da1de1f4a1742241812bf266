HID: i2c-hid: Send power-on command after reset

Before commit 67b18dfb8cfc ("HID: i2c-hid: Remove runtime power
management"), any i2c-hid touchscreens would typically be runtime-suspended
between the driver loading and Xorg or a Wayland compositor opening it,
causing it to be resumed again. This means that before this change,
we would call i2c_hid_set_power(OFF), i2c_hid_set_power(ON) before the
graphical session would start listening to the touchscreen.

It turns out that at least some SIS touchscreens, such as the one found
on the Asus T100HA, need a power-on command after reset, otherwise they
will not send any events.
