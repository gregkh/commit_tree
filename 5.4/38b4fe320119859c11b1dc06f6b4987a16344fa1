net: usb: lan78xx: Connect PHY before registering MAC

As soon as the netdev is registers, the kernel can start using the
interface. If the driver connects the MAC to the PHY after the netdev
is registered, there is a race condition where the interface can be
opened without having the PHY connected.

Change the order to close this race condition.
