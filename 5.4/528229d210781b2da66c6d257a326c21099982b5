powerpc: Add support for adding an ESM blob to the zImage wrapper

For secure VMs, the signing tool will create a ticket called the "ESM blob"
for the Enter Secure Mode ultravisor call with the signatures of the kernel
and initrd among other things.

This adds support to the wrapper script for adding that blob via the "-e"
option to the zImage.pseries.

It also adds code to the zImage wrapper itself to retrieve and if necessary
relocate the blob, and pass its address to Linux via the device-tree, to be
later consumed by prom_init.
