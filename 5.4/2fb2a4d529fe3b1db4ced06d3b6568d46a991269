xprtrdma: Refresh the documenting comment in frwr_ops.c

Things have changed since this comment was written. In particular,
the reworking of connection closing, on-demand creation of MRs, and
the removal of fr_state all mean that deferring MR recovery to
frwr_map is no longer needed. The description is obsolete.
