ASoC: core: use list_del_init and move it back to soc_cleanup_component

commit a0a4bf57a977 ("ASoC: core: delete component->card_list in soc_remove_component only")
was trying to fix a kernel oops when list_del was called twice without
re-init the list. Use list_del_init() can solve it, too. Besides, it
will be more readable if we cleanup all component related resource at
soc_cleanup_component().
