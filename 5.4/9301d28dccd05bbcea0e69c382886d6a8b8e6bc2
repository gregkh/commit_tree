arm64: dts: rockchip: fix vcc_host_5v regulator for usb3 host

According to rock64 schemetic V2 and V3, the VCC_HOST_5V output is
controlled by USB_20_HOST_DRV, which is the same as VCC_HOST1_5V.

V1 hardware was never sold and only V2/V3 is with customers,
so there is no need to keep a seaprate v1 version around.
