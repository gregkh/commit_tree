coresight: etm4x: Add ETM PIDs for SDM845 and MSM8996

Instead of overriding the peripheral id(PID) check in AMBA
by hardcoding them in DT, add the PIDs to the ETM4x driver.
Here we use Unique Component Identifier(UCI) for MSM8996
since the ETM and CPU debug module shares the same PIDs.
SDM845 does not support CPU debug module.
