mfd: cros_ec: Switch to use the new cros-ec-chardev driver

With the purpose of remove the things that far extends the bounds of
what a MFD was designed to do, instantiate the new platform misc
cros-ec-chardev driver and get rid of all the unneeded code. After this
patch the misc chardev driver is a sub-device of the MFD, and all the
new file operations should be implemented there.
