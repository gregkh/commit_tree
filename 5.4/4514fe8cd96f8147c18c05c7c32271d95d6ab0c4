Documentation/arm/samsung-s3c24xx: Remove stray U+FEFF character to fix title

It seems a UTF-8 byte order mark (the least useful kind of BOM...) snuck
into the file and broke Sphinx's detection of the title line.

Besides making arm/samsung-s3c24xx/index.html look a little better, this
patch also confines the non-index pages in arm/samsung-s3c24xx to their
own table of contents.
