drm/amd/display: Incorrect Read Interval Time For CR Sequence

[WHY]
TRAINING_AUX_RD_INTERVAL (DPCD 000Eh) modifies the read interval
for the EQ training sequence. CR read interval should remain 100 us.
Currently, the CR interval is also being modified.

[HOW]
lt_settings->cr_pattern_time should always be 100 us.
