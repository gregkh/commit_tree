PCI/P2PDMA: Whitelist some Intel host bridges

Intel devices do not have good support for P2P requests that span different
host bridges as the transactions will cross the QPI/UPI bus and this does
not perform well.

Therefore, enable support for these devices only if the host bridges match.

Add Intel devices that have been tested and are known to work. There are
likely many others out there that will need to be tested and added.
