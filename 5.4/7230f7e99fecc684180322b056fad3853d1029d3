arm64: cpufeature: Effectively expose FRINT capability to userspace

The HWCAP framework will detect a new capability based on the sanitized
version of the ID registers.

Sanitization is based on a whitelist, so any field not described will end
up to be zeroed.

At the moment, ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1.FRINTTS is not described in
ftr_id_aa64isar1. This means the field will be zeroed and therefore the
userspace will not be able to see the HWCAP even if the hardware
supports the feature.

This can be fixed by describing the field in ftr_id_aa64isar1.
