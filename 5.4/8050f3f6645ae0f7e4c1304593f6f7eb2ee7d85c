PCI: Use static const struct, not const static struct

Move the static keyword to the front of declarations of pci_regs_behavior[]
and pcie_cap_regs_behavior[], which resolves compiler warnings when
building with "W=1":

  drivers/pci/pci-bridge-emul.c:41:1: warning: ‘static’ is not at beginning of
  declaration [-Wold-style-declaration]
   const static struct pci_bridge_reg_behavior pci_regs_behavior[] = {
   ^
  drivers/pci/pci-bridge-emul.c:176:1: warning: ‘static’ is not at beginning of
  declaration [-Wold-style-declaration]
   const static struct pci_bridge_reg_behavior pcie_cap_regs_behavior[] = {
   ^
