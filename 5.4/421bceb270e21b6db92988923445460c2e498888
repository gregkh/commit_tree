nfp: read chip model from the PluDevice register

The PluDevice register provides the authoritative chip model/revision.

Since the model number is purely used for reporting purposes, follow
the hardware team convention of subtracting 0x10 from the PluDevice
register to obtain the chip model/revision number.
