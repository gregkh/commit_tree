regulator: tps65132: Stop parsing DT when gpio is not found

In case of a missing (optional) gpio don't fall through up to
"ti,active-discharge-time-us" due to
devm_fwnode_get_index_gpiod_from_child() returning NULL (since
gpiod_get_from_of_node() returned NULL) but rather indicate success as
intended.

This makes the driver probe correctly when e.g. only the enable gpio is
given.
