mtd: spi-nor: hisi-sfc: Add of_node_put() before break

Each iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node puts the previous
node, but in the case of a break from the middle of the loop, there
is no put, thus causing a memory leak. Hence add an of_node_put before
the break.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
