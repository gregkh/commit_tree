tipc: optimize link synching mechanism

This commit along with the next one are to resolve the issues with the
link changeover mechanism. See that commit for details.

Basically, for the link synching, from now on, we will send only one
single ("dummy") SYNCH message to peer. The SYNCH message does not
contain any data, just a header conveying the synch point to the peer.

A new node capability flag ("TIPC_TUNNEL_ENHANCED") is introduced for
backward compatible!
