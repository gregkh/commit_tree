Revert "hwrng: core - Freeze khwrng thread during suspend"

This reverts commit 03a3bb7ae631 ("hwrng: core - Freeze khwrng
thread during suspend"), ff296293b353 ("random: Support freezable
kthreads in add_hwgenerator_randomness()") and 59b569480dc8 ("random:
Use wait_event_freezable() in add_hwgenerator_randomness()").

These patches introduced regressions and we need more time to
get them ready for mainline.
