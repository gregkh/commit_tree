net: stmmac: fix argument to stmmac_pcs_ctrl_ane()

The stmmac_pcs_ctrl_ane() expects a register address as
argument 1, but for some reason the mac_device_info is
being passed.

Fix the warning (and possible bug) from sparse:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:2613:17: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:2613:17:    expected void [noderef] <asn:2> *ioaddr
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:2613:17:    got struct mac_device_info *hw
