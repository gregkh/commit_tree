drm/amdgpu: Bail earlier when amdgpu.cik_/si_support is not set to 1

Bail from the pci_driver probe function instead of from the drm_driver
load function.

This avoid /dev/dri/card0 temporarily getting registered and then
unregistered again, sending unwanted add / remove udev events to
userspace.

Specifically this avoids triggering the (userspace) bug fixed by this
plymouth merge-request:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/plymouth/plymouth/merge_requests/59

Note that despite that being a userspace bug, not sending unnecessary
udev events is a good idea in general.
