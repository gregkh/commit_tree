nvme: allow 64-bit results in passthru commands

It is not possible to get 64-bit results from the passthru commands,
what prevents from getting for the Capabilities (CAP) property value.

As a result, it is not possible to implement IOL's NVMe Conformance
test 4.3 Case 1 for Fabrics targets [1] (page 123).

This issue has been already discussed [2], but without a solution.

This patch solves the problem by adding new ioctls with a new
passthru structure, including 64-bit results. The older ioctls stay
unchanged.
