drm/tinydrm: Clean up tinydrm_spi_transfer()

Prep work before moving the function to mipi-dbi.

tinydrm_spi_transfer() was made to support one class of drivers in
drivers/staging/fbtft that has not been converted to DRM yet, so strip
away the unused functionality:
- Start byte (header) is not used.
- No driver relies on the automatic 16-bit byte swapping on little endian
  machines with SPI controllers only supporting 8 bits per word.

Other changes:
- No need to initialize ret
- No need for the WARN since mipi-dbi only uses 8 and 16 bpw.
- Use spi_message_init_with_transfers()
