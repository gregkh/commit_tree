KVM: X86: Tune PLE Window tracepoint

The PLE window tracepoint triggers even if the window is not changed,
and the wording can be a bit confusing too.  One example line:

  kvm_ple_window: vcpu 0: ple_window 4096 (shrink 4096)

It easily let people think of "the window now is 4096 which is
shrinked", but the truth is the value actually didn't change (4096).

Let's only dump this message if the value really changed, and we make
the message even simpler like:

  kvm_ple_window: vcpu 4 old 4096 new 8192 (growed)
