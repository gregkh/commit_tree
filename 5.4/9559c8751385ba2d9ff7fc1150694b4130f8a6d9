drm/i915/selftests: Check the context size

Add a redzone to our context image and check the HW does not write into
after a context save, to verify that we have the correct context size.
(This does vary with feature bits, so test with a live setup that should
match how we run userspace.)

v2: Check the redzone on every context unpin
v3: Use a kernel context to prevent loading garbage for ringbuffer
