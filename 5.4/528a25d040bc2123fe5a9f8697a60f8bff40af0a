drm: meson: use match data to detect vpu compatibility

This patch introduce new enum which contains all VPU family (GXBB,
GXL, GXM and G12A).
This enum is used to detect the VPU compatible with the device.

We only need to set .data to the corresponding enum in the device
table, no need to check .compatible string anymore.
