s390/startup: add initial pgm check handler

The startup code is getting more complicated with features like kaslr and
secure boot in place. In a potential unexpected startup code crash case
the system would end up in a pgm check loop at address 0, overwriting
pgm check old psw value and just making debugging more complicated. To
avoid that introduce startup program check handler which is active
immediately after kernel start and until early_pgm_check_handler is set
in kernel/early.c. So it covers kernel relocation phase and transition
to it. This pgm check handler simply saves general/control registers and
psw in the save area which should guarantee that we still have something
to look at when standalone dumper is called without saving registers. And
it does disabled wait with a faulty address in the end.
