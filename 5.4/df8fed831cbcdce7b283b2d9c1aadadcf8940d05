mtd: rawnand: au1550nd: Fix au_read_buf16() prototype

Commit 7e534323c416 ("mtd: rawnand: Pass a nand_chip object to
chip->read_xxx() hooks") modified the prototype of the struct nand_chip
read_buf function pointer. In the au1550nd driver we have 2
implementations of read_buf. The previously mentioned commit modified
the au_read_buf() implementation to match the function pointer, but not
au_read_buf16(). This results in a compiler warning for MIPS
db1xxx_defconfig builds:

  drivers/mtd/nand/raw/au1550nd.c:443:57:
    warning: pointer type mismatch in conditional expression

Fix this by updating the prototype of au_read_buf16() to take a struct
nand_chip pointer as its first argument, as is expected after commit
7e534323c416 ("mtd: rawnand: Pass a nand_chip object to chip->read_xxx()
hooks").

Note that this shouldn't have caused any functional issues at runtime,
since the offset of the struct mtd_info within struct nand_chip is 0
making mtd_to_nand() effectively a type-cast.
