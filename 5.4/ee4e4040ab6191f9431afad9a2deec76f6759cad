RDMA/i40iw: Associate ibdev to netdev before IB device registration

i40iw IB device registration fails with ENODEV.

ib_register_device
 setup_device/setup_port_data
  i40iw_port_immutable
   ib_query_port
     iw_query_port
      ib_device_get_netdev(ENODEV)

ib_device_get_netdev() does not have a netdev associated
with the ibdev and thus fails.
Use ib_device_set_netdev() to associate netdev to ibdev
in i40iw before IB device registration.
