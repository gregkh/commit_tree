rcu: Use CONFIG_PREEMPTION

CONFIG_PREEMPTION is selected by CONFIG_PREEMPT and by
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT. Both PREEMPT and PREEMPT_RT require the same
functionality which today depends on CONFIG_PREEMPT.

Switch the conditionals in RCU to use CONFIG_PREEMPTION.

That's the first step towards RCU on RT. The further tweaks are work in
progress. This neither touches the selftest bits which need a closer look
by Paul.
