drm/shmem: Put pages independent of a SG table being set

If a driver does its own management of pages, the shmem helper object's
pages array could be allocated when a SG table is not. There's not
really any  good reason to tie putting pages with having a SG table when
freeing the object, so just put pages if the pages array is populated.
