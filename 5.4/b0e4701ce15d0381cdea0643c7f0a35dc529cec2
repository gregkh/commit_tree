bpf: export bpf_map_inc_not_zero

Rename existing bpf_map_inc_not_zero to __bpf_map_inc_not_zero to
indicate that it's caller's responsibility to do proper locking.
Create and export bpf_map_inc_not_zero wrapper that properly
locks map_idr_lock. Will be used in the next commit to
hold a map while cloning a socket.
