dma-buf: make dma_fence structure a bit smaller v2

We clear the callback list on kref_put so that by the time we
release the fence it is unused. No one should be adding to the cb_list
that they don't themselves hold a reference for.

This small change is actually making the structure 16% smaller.

v2: add the comment to the code as well.
