rcu/nocb: Rename and document no-CB CB kthread sleep trace event

The nocb_cb_wait() function traces a "FollowerSleep" trace_rcu_nocb_wake()
event, which never was documented and is now misleading.  This commit
therefore changes "FollowerSleep" to "CBSleep", documents this, and
updates the documentation for "Sleep" as well.
