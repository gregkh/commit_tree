Revert "of/platform: Add functional dependency link from DT bindings"

This reverts commit 690ff7881b2681afca1c3c063f4a5cb7c71d9d8b.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
