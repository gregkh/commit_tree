rcu/nocb: Round down for number of no-CBs grace-period kthreads

Currently, when the square root of the number of CPUs is rounded down
by int_sqrt(), this round-down is applied to the number of callback
kthreads per grace-period kthreads.  This makes almost no difference
for large systems, but results in oddities such as three no-CBs
grace-period kthreads for a five-CPU system, which is a bit excessive.
This commit therefore causes the round-down to apply to the number of
no-CBs grace-period kthreads, so that systems with from four to eight
CPUs have only two no-CBs grace period kthreads.
