x86: alternative.h: use asm_inline for all alternative variants

Most, if not all, uses of the alternative* family just provide one or
two instructions in .text, but the string literal can be quite large,
causing gcc to overestimate the size of the generated code. That in
turn affects its decisions about inlining of the function containing
the alternative() asm statement.

New enough versions of gcc allow one to overrule the estimated size by
using "asm inline" instead of just "asm". So replace asm by the helper
asm_inline, which for older gccs just expands to asm.
