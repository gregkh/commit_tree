ASoC: SOF: pcm: fix resource leak in hw_free

Fix a bug in sof_pcm_hw_free() where some cleanup actions were
skipped if STREAM_PCM_FREE IPC was already successfully sent to
DSP when the stream was stopped or suspended. This is incorrect
as hw_free should clean up also other resources, including pcm
lib page allocations, period elapsed work queue and call to
platform hw_free.
