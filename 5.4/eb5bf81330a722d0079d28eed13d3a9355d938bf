tracing/kprobe: Add per-probe delete from event

Allow user to delete a probe from event. This is done by head
match. For example, if we have 2 probes on an event

$ cat kprobe_events
p:kprobes/testprobe _do_fork r1=%ax r2=%dx
p:kprobes/testprobe idle_fork r1=%ax r2=%cx

Then you can remove one of them by passing the head of definition
which identify the probe.

$ echo "-:kprobes/testprobe idle_fork" >> kprobe_events
