perf augmented_raw_syscalls: Support copying two string syscall args

Starting with the renameat and renameat2 syscall, that both receive as
second and fourth parameters a pathname:

  # perf trace -e rename* mv one ANOTHER
  LLVM: dumping /home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf/examples/bpf/augmented_raw_syscalls.o
  mv: cannot stat 'one': No such file or directory
  renameat2(AT_FDCWD, "one", AT_FDCWD, "ANOTHER", RENAME_NOREPLACE) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
  #

Since the per CPU scratch buffer map has space for two maximum sized
pathnames, the verifier is satisfied that there will be no overrun.
