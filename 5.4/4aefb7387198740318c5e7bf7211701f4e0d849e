ASoC: rockchip-max98090: Remove MICBIAS as supply of input pin IN34

Commit ec0d23b295b9 ("ASoC: rockchip-max98090: Fix the Headset Mic
route.") moved the MICBIAS widget to supply Headset Mic but forget to
remove the MICBIAS widget to supply IN34 which is not really needed, so
remove that path so we have:

   IN34 <==== Headset MIC <==== MICBIAS
