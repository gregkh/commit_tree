btrfs: silence maybe-uninitialized warning in clone_range

GCC throws warning message as below:

‘clone_src_i_size’ may be used uninitialized in this function
[-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
 #define IS_ALIGNED(x, a)  (((x) & ((typeof(x))(a) - 1)) == 0)
                       ^
fs/btrfs/send.c:5088:6: note: ‘clone_src_i_size’ was declared here
 u64 clone_src_i_size;
   ^
The clone_src_i_size is only used as call-by-reference
in a call to get_inode_info().

Silence the warning by initializing clone_src_i_size to 0.

Note that the warning is a false positive and reported by older versions
of GCC (eg. 7.x) but not eg 9.x. As there have been numerous people, the
patch is applied. Setting clone_src_i_size to 0 does not otherwise make
sense and would not do any action in case the code changes in the future.
