ARM: dts: rockchip: A few fixes for veyron-{fievel,tiger}

Fix/improve a few things for veyron fievel/tiger:

- move 'vccsys' regulator from tiger to fievel, both boards
  have it (and tiger includes the fievel .dtsi)
- move 'ext_gmac' node below regulators
- fix GPIO ids of vcc5_host1 and vcc5_host2 regulators
- remove reset configuration from 'gmac' node, this is already done
  in rk3288.dtsi
- fixed style issues of some multi-line comments
- switch 'vcc18_lcdt', 'vdd10_lcd' and 'vcc33_ccd' regulators off
  during suspend
- no pull-up on the Bluetooth wake-up pin, there is an external
  pull-up. The signal is active low, add the 'bt_host_wake_l'
  pinctrl config
- move BC 1.2 pins up in the pinctrl config to keep 'wake only' pins
  separate
- add BC 1.2 pins to sleep config
