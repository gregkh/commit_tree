scripts: add_namespace: Fix coccicheck failed

Now all scripts in scripts/coccinelle to be automatically called
by coccicheck. However new adding add_namespace.cocci does not
support report mode, which make coccicheck failed.
This add "virtual report" to  make the coccicheck go ahead smoothly.

Fixes: eb8305aecb95 ("scripts: Coccinelle script for namespace dependencies.")
