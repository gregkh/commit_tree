ASoC: SOF: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

Also, if a debugfs call fails, userspace is notified with an error in
the log, so no need to log the error again.

Because we no longer need to check the return value, there's no need to
save the dentry returned by debugfs.  Just use the dentry in the file
pointer if we really need to figure out the "name" of the file being
opened.
