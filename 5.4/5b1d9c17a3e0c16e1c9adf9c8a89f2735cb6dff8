r8152: avoid to call napi_disable twice

Call napi_disable() twice would cause dead lock. There are three situations
may result in the issue.

1. rtl8152_pre_reset() and set_carrier() are run at the same time.
2. Call rtl8152_set_tunable() after rtl8152_close().
3. Call rtl8152_set_ringparam() after rtl8152_close().

For #1, use the same solution as commit 84811412464d ("r8152: Re-order
napi_disable in rtl8152_close"). For #2 and #3, add checking the flag
of IFF_UP and using napi_disable/napi_enable during mutex.
