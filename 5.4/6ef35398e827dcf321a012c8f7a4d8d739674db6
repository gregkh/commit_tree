rtc: Add Amlogic Virtual Wake RTC

The Amlogic Meson GX SoCs uses a special register to store the
time in seconds to wakeup after a system suspend.

In order to be able to reuse the RTC wakealarm feature, this
driver implements a fake RTC device which uses the system time
to deduce a suspend delay.
