fuse: convert direct_io to simple api

Change of semantics in fuse_async_req_send/fuse_send_(read|write): these
can now return error, in which case the 'end' callback isn't called, so the
fuse_io_args object needs to be freed.

Added verification that the return value is sane (less than or equal to the
requested read/write size).
