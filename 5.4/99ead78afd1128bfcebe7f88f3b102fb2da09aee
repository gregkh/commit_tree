powerpc/mce: Fix MCE handling for huge pages

The current code would fail on huge pages addresses, since the shift would
be incorrect. Use the correct page shift value returned by
__find_linux_pte() to get the correct physical address. The code is more
generic and can handle both regular and compound pages.
