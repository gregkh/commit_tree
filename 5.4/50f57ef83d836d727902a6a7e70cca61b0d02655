ARM: OMAP2+: Delete an unnecessary kfree() call in omap_hsmmc_pdata_init()

A null pointer would be passed to a call of the function "kfree" directly
after a call of the function "kzalloc" failed at one place.
Remove this superfluous function call.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
