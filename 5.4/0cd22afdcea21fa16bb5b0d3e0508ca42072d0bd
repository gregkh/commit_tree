mm/gup: fix a misnamed "write" argument, and a related bug

In several routines, the "flags" argument is incorrectly named "write".
Change it to "flags".

Also, in one place, the misnaming led to an actual bug:
"flags & FOLL_WRITE" is required, rather than just "flags".
(That problem was flagged by krobot, in v1 of this patch.)

Also, change the flags argument from int, to unsigned int.

You can see that this was a simple oversight, because the
calling code passes "flags" to the fifth argument:

gup_pgd_range():
    ...
    if (!gup_huge_pd(__hugepd(pgd_val(pgd)), addr,
		    PGDIR_SHIFT, next, flags, pages, nr))

...which, until this patch, the callees referred to as "write".

Also, change two lines to avoid checkpatch line length
complaints, and another line to fix another oversight
that checkpatch called out: missing "int" on pdshift.
