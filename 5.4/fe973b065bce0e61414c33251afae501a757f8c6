f2fs: fix to handle quota_{on,off} correctly

With quota_ino feature on, generic/232 reports an inconsistence issue
on the image.

The root cause is that the testcase tries to:
- use quotactl to shutdown journalled quota based on sysfile;
- and then use quotactl to enable/turn on quota based on specific file
(aquota.user or aquota.group).

Eventually, quota sysfile will be out-of-update due to following specific
file creation.

Change as below to fix this issue:
- deny enabling quota based on specific file if quota sysfile exists.
- set SBI_QUOTA_NEED_REPAIR once sysfile based quota shutdowns via
ioctl.
