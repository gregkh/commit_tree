pinctrl: rk805: Make structures constant

Static structures rk805_pinctrl_desc and rk805_gpio_chip, of types
gpio_chip and pinctrl_desc respectively, are not used except to be
copied into the fields of a different variable. Hence make
rk805_pinctrl_desc and rk805_gpio_chip both constant to protect them
from unintended modification.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
