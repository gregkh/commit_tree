btrfs: only reserve metadata_size for inodes

Historically we reserved worst case for every btree operation, and
generally speaking we want to do that in cases where it could be the
worst case.  However for updating inodes we know the inode items are
already in the tree, so it will only be an update operation and never an
insert operation.  This allows us to always reserve only the
metadata_size amount for inode updates rather than the
insert_metadata_size amount.
