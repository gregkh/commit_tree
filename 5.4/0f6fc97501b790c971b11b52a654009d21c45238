ASoC: mchp-i2s-mcc: Wait for RX/TX RDY only if controller is running

Since hw_free() can be called multiple times and not just after a stop
trigger command, we should check whether the RX or TX ready interrupt was
truly enabled previously. For this, we assure that the condition of the
wait event is always true, except when RX/TX interrupts are enabled.
