x86/hyperv: Add functions to allocate/deallocate page for Hyper-V

Introduce two new functions, hv_alloc_hyperv_page() and
hv_free_hyperv_page(), to allocate/deallocate memory with the size and
alignment that Hyper-V expects as a page. Although currently they are not
used, they are ready to be used to allocate/deallocate memory on x86 when
their ARM64 counterparts are implemented, keeping symmetry between
architectures with potentially different guest page sizes.
