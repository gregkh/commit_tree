leds: as3645a: Use generic support for composing LED names

Switch to using generic LED support for composing LED class
device name.

After switching to new led_classdev_register_ext() the validity
of struct led_classdev's name property is no longer guaranteed,
and therefore rely on struct device's kobj.name instead.
