clk: mvebu: ap806-cpu: prepare mapping of AP807 CPU clock

This patch allows same flow to be executed on chips with different
register mappings like AP806 and, in the future, AP807.

Note: this patch has no functional effect, and only prepares the
driver for additional chips to be supported by retrieving the right
device data depenging on the compatible property.
