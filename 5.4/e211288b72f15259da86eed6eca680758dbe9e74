x86/hyperv: Make vapic support x2apic mode

Now that there's Hyper-V IOMMU driver, Linux can switch to x2apic mode
when supported by the vcpus.

However, the apic access functions for Hyper-V enlightened apic assume
xapic mode only.

As a result, Linux fails to bring up secondary cpus when run as a guest
in QEMU/KVM with both hv_apic and x2apic enabled.

According to Michael Kelley, when in x2apic mode, the Hyper-V synthetic
apic MSRs behave exactly the same as the corresponding architectural
x2apic MSRs, so there's no need to override the apic accessors.  The
only exception is hv_apic_eoi_write, which benefits from lazy EOI when
available; however, its implementation works for both xapic and x2apic
modes.
