include/bpf.h: Remove map_insert_ctx() stubs

When we changed the device and CPU maps to use linked lists instead of
bitmaps, we also removed the need for the map_insert_ctx() helpers to keep
track of the bitmaps inside each map. However, it seems I forgot to remove
the function definitions stubs, so remove those here.
