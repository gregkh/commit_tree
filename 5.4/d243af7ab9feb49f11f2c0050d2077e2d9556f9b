SMB3: Fix persistent handles reconnect

When the client hits a network reconnect, it re-opens every open
file with a create context to reconnect a persistent handle. All
create context types should be 8-bytes aligned but the padding
was missed for that one. As a result, some servers don't allow
us to reconnect handles and return an error. The problem occurs
when the problematic context is not at the end of the create
request packet. Fix this by adding a proper padding at the end
of the reconnect persistent handle context.
