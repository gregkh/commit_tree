iomap: split size and error for iomap_dio_rw ->end_io

Modify the calling convention for the iomap_dio_rw ->end_io() callback.
Rather than passing either dio->error or dio->size as the 'size' argument,
instead pass both the dio->error and the dio->size value separately.

In the instance that an error occurred during a write, we currently cannot
determine whether any blocks have been allocated beyond the current EOF and
data has subsequently been written to these blocks within the ->end_io()
callback. As a result, we cannot judge whether we should take the truncate
failed write path. Having both dio->error and dio->size will allow us to
perform such checks within this callback.
