drm/i915: Stop reconfiguring our shmemfs mountpoint

The filesystem reconfigure API is undergoing a transition, breaking our
current code. As we only set the default options, we can simply remove
the call to s_op->remount_fs(). In the future, when HW permits, we can
try re-enabling huge page support, albeit as suggested with new per-file
controls.
