fs: kernfs: Fix possible null-pointer dereferences in kernfs_path_from_node_locked()

In kernfs_path_from_node_locked(), there is an if statement on line 147
to check whether buf is NULL:
    if (buf)

When buf is NULL, it is used on line 151:
    len += strlcpy(buf + len, parent_str, ...)
and line 158:
    len += strlcpy(buf + len, "/", ...)
and line 160:
    len += strlcpy(buf + len, kn->name, ...)

Thus, possible null-pointer dereferences may occur.

To fix these possible bugs, buf is checked before being used.
If it is NULL, -EINVAL is returned.

These bugs are found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
