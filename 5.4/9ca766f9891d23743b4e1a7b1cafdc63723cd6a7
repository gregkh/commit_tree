powerpc/64s/pseries: machine check convert to use common event code

The common machine_check_event data structures and queues are mostly
platform independent, with powernv decoding SRR1/DSISR/etc., into
machine_check_event objects.

This patch converts pseries to use this infrastructure by decoding
fwnmi/rtas data into machine_check_event objects.

This allows queueing to be used by a subsequent change to delay the
virtual mode handling of machine checks that occur in kernel space
where it is unsafe to switch immediately to virtual mode, similarly
to powernv.
