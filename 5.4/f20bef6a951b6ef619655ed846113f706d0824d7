RDMA/odp: Make the three ways to create a umem_odp clear

The three paths to build the umem_odps are kind of muddled, they are:
- As a normal ib_mr umem
- As a child in an implicit ODP umem tree
- As the root of an implicit ODP umem tree

Only the first two are actually umem's, the last is an abuse.

The implicit case can only be triggered by explicit driver request, it
should never be co-mingled with the normal case. While we are here, make
sensible function names and add some comments to make this clearer.
