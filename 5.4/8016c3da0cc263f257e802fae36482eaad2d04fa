tty: max310x: fix off-by-one buffer access when storing overrun

A recent change split the insertion loop into two parts. The first part
accessed bytes 0, 1, ... (rxlen - 2), and the second part by mistake
took offset `rxlen` instead of the correct `rxlen - 1`. So one byte was
not stored, and the final access wrote past the end of the rx_buf.
