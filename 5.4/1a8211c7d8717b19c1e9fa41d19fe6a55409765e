KVM: VMX: Remove specialized handling of unexpected exit-reasons

Commit bf653b78f960 ("KVM: vmx: Introduce handle_unexpected_vmexit
and handle WAITPKG vmexit") introduced specialized handling of
specific exit-reasons that should not be raised by CPU because
KVM configures VMCS such that they should never be raised.

However, since commit 7396d337cfad ("KVM: x86: Return to userspace
with internal error on unexpected exit reason"), VMX & SVM
exit handlers were modified to generically handle all unexpected
exit-reasons by returning to userspace with internal error.

Therefore, there is no need for specialized handling of specific
unexpected exit-reasons (This specialized handling also introduced
inconsistency for these exit-reasons to silently skip guest instruction
instead of return to userspace on internal-error).
