wimax: i2400: Fix memory leak in i2400m_op_rfkill_sw_toggle

In the implementation of i2400m_op_rfkill_sw_toggle() the allocated
buffer for cmd should be released before returning. The
documentation for i2400m_msg_to_dev() says when it returns the buffer
can be reused. Meaning cmd should be released in either case. Move
kfree(cmd) before return to be reached by all execution paths.
