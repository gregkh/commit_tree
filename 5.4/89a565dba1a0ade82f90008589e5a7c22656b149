drm: kirin: Move ade drm init to kirin drm drv

As part of refactoring the kirin driver to better support
different hardware revisions, this patch renames ade_data to
kirin_drm_private, and moves crtc_init and plane_init to
kirin drm drv too. Now that they are generic the functions
can be shared between the kirin620 and (to be added later)
kirin960 specific support code.
