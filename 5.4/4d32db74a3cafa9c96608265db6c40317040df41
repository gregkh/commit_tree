dt-bindings: iio: ad7192: Fix DTC warning in the example

The example contains an SPI bus and device, but doesn't have the
appropriate size and address cells size.

This creates a DTC warning when the example is compiled since the default
ones will not match what the device uses. Let's add them to remove that
warning.
