drm/radeon: Fill out gem_object->resv

That way we can ditch our gem_prime_res_obj implementation. Since ttm
absolutely needs the right reservation object all the boilerplate is
already there and we just have to wire it up correctly.

Note that gem/prime doesn't care when we do this, as long as we do it
before the bo is registered and someone can call the handle2fd ioctl
on it.

Aside: ttm_buffer_object.ttm_resv could probably be ditched in favour
of always passing a non-NULL resv to ttm_bo_init(). At least for gem
drivers that would avoid having two of these, on in ttm_buffer_object
and the other in drm_gem_object, one just there for confusion.
