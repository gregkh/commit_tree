mm, page_owner: decouple freeing stack trace from debug_pagealloc

Commit 8974558f49a6 ("mm, page_owner, debug_pagealloc: save and dump
freeing stack trace") enhanced page_owner to also store freeing stack
trace, when debug_pagealloc is also enabled.  KASAN would also like to
do this [1] to improve error reports to debug e.g. UAF issues.

Kirill has suggested that the freeing stack trace saving should be also
possible to be enabled separately from KASAN or debug_pagealloc, i.e.
with an extra boot option.  Qian argued that we have enough options
already, and avoiding the extra overhead is not worth the complications
in the case of a debugging option.  Kirill noted that the extra stack
handle in struct page_owner requires 0.1% of memory.

This patch therefore enables free stack saving whenever page_owner is
enabled, regardless of whether debug_pagealloc or KASAN is also enabled.
KASAN kernels booted with page_owner=on will thus benefit from the
improved error reports.
