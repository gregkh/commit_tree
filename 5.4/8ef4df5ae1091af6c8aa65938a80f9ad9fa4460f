Revert "of/platform: Fix device_links_supplier_sync_state_resume() warning"

This reverts commit 5adf5781019dd21233d6d13ab0d78bf03a13d4f1.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
