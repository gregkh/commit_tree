alarmtimer: Use EOPNOTSUPP instead of ENOTSUPP

ENOTSUPP is not supposed to be returned to userspace. This was found on an
OpenPower machine, where the RTC does not support set_alarm.

On that system, a clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM, ...) results in
"524 Unknown error 524"

Replace it with EOPNOTSUPP which results in the expected "95 Operation not
supported" error.

Fixes: 1c6b39ad3f01 (alarmtimers: Return -ENOTSUPP if no RTC device is present)
