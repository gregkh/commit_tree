USB: adutux: fix use-after-free on disconnect

The driver was clearing its struct usb_device pointer, which it used as
an inverted disconnected flag, before deregistering the character device
and without serialising against racing release().

This could lead to a use-after-free if a racing release() callback
observes the cleared pointer and frees the driver data before
disconnect() is finished with it.

This could also lead to NULL-pointer dereferences in a racing open().
