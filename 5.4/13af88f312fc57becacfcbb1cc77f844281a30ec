coresight: tmc-etr: Fix updating buffer in not-snapshot mode.

TMC etr always copies all available data to perf aux buffer, which
may exceed the available space in perf aux buffer. It isn't suitable
for not-snapshot mode, because:
1) It may overwrite previously written data.
2) It may make the perf_event_mmap_page->aux_head report having more
or less data than the reality.

So change to only copy the latest data fitting the available space in
perf aux buffer.
