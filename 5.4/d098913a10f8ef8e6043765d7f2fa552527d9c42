bus: ti-sysc: Fix clock handling for no-idle quirks

NFSroot can fail on dra7 when cpsw is probed using ti-sysc interconnect
target module driver as reported by Keerthy.

Device clocks and the interconnect target module may or may not be
enabled by the bootloader on init, but we currently assume the clocks
and module are on from the bootloader for "ti,no-idle" and
"ti,no-idle-on-init" quirks as reported by Grygorii Strashko.

Let's fix the issue by always enabling clocks init, and
never disable them for "ti,no-idle" quirk. For "ti,no-idle-on-init"
quirk, we must decrement the usage count later on to allow PM
runtime to idle the module if requested.
