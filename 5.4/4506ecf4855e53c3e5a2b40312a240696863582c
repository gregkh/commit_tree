KVM: x86/mmu: Revert "Revert "KVM: MMU: collapse TLB flushes when zap all pages""

Now that the fast invalidate mechanism has been reintroduced, restore
the performance tweaks for fast invalidation that existed prior to its
removal.

Paraphrashing the original changelog:

  Reload the mmu on all vCPUs after updating the generation number so
  that obsolete pages are not used by any vCPUs.  This allows collapsing
  all TLB flushes during obsolete page zapping into a single flush, as
  there is no need to flush when dropping mmu_lock (to reschedule).

  Note: a remote TLB flush is still needed before freeing the pages as
  other vCPUs may be doing a lockless shadow page walk.

Opportunstically improve the comments restored by the revert (the
code itself is a true revert).

This reverts commit f34d251d66ba263c077ed9d2bbd1874339a4c887.
