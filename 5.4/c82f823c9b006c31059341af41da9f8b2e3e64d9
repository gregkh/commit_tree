btrfs: tie extent buffer and it's token together

Further simplifaction of the get/set helpers is possible when the token
is uniquely tied to an extent buffer. A condition and an assignment can
be avoided.

The initializations are moved closer to the first use when the extent
buffer is valid. There's one exception in __push_leaf_left where the
token is reused.
