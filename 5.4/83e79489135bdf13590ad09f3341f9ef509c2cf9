net/mlx5: DR, Skip rehash for tables with byte mask zero

The byte mask fields affect on the hash index distribution,
when the byte mask is zero, the hash calculation will always
be equal to the same index.

To avoid unneeded rehash of hash tables mark the table to skip
rehash.

This is needed by the next patch which will limit table rehash
to reduce memory consumption.
