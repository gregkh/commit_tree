x86/cpu: Move arch_smt_update() to a neutral place

arch_smt_update() will be used to control IPI/NMI broadcasting via the
shorthand mechanism. Keeping it in the bugs file and calling the apic
function from there is possible, but not really intuitive.

Move it to a neutral place and invoke the bugs function from there.

No functional change.
