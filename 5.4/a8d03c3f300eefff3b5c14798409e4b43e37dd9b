x86/syscalls: Use the compat versions of rt_sigsuspend() and rt_sigprocmask()

I'm working on some code that detects at build time if there's a
COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINE() that is not referenced in the x86 syscall tables.
It catches three offenders: rt_sigsuspend(), rt_sigprocmask(), and
sendfile64().

For rt_sigsuspend() and rt_sigprocmask(), the only potential difference
between the native and compat versions is that the compat version converts
the sigset_t, but, on little endian architectures, the conversion is a
no-op.  This is why they both currently work on x86.

To make the code more consistent, and to make the upcoming patches work,
rewire x86 to use the compat vesions.

sendfile64() is more complicated, and will be addressed separately.
