ASoC: soc-core: dapm related setup at one place

Current ASoC setups some dapm related member at
snd_soc_component_initialize() which is called when component was
registered, and setups remaining member at soc_probe_component()
which is called when component was probed.
This kind of setup separation is no meanings, and it is very
difficult to read and confusable.
This patch setups all dapm settings at one place.
