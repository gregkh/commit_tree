media: ipu3-cio2: Parse information from firmware without using callbacks

Instead of using the convenience function
v4l2_async_notifier_parse_fwnode_endpoints(), parse the endpoints and set
up the async sub-devices without using callbacks. While this adds a little
bit of code, it makes parsing the endpoints quite a bit more simple and
gives more control to the driver over the process. The parsing assumes
D-PHY instead of letting the V4L2 fwnode framework guess it.
