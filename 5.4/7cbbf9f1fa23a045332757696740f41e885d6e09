ixgbe: fix xdp handle calculations

Currently, we don't add headroom to the handle in ixgbe_zca_free,
ixgbe_alloc_buffer_slow_zc and ixgbe_alloc_buffer_zc. The addition of the
headroom to the handle was removed in
commit d8c3061e5edd ("ixgbe: modify driver for handling offsets"), which
will break things when headroom isvnon-zero. This patch fixes this and uses
xsk_umem_adjust_offset to add it appropritely based on the mode being run.
