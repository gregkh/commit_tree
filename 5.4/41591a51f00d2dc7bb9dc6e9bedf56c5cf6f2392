iocost: don't nest spin_lock_irq in ioc_weight_write()

This code causes a static analysis warning:

    block/blk-iocost.c:2113 ioc_weight_write() error: double lock 'irq'

We disable IRQs in blkg_conf_prep() and re-enable them in
blkg_conf_finish().  IRQ disable/enable should not be nested because
that means the IRQs will be enabled at the first unlock instead of the
second one.
