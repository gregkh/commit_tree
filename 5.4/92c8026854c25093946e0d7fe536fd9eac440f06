vfio_pci: Restore original state on release

vfio_pci_enable() saves the device's initial configuration information
with the intent that it is restored in vfio_pci_disable().  However,
the commit referenced in Fixes: below replaced the call to
__pci_reset_function_locked(), which is not wrapped in a state save
and restore, with pci_try_reset_function(), which overwrites the
restored device state with the current state before applying it to the
device.  Reinstate use of __pci_reset_function_locked() to return to
the desired behavior.

Fixes: 890ed578df82 ("vfio-pci: Use pci "try" reset interface")
