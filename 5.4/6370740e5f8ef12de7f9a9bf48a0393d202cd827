fs/dax: Fix pmd vs pte conflict detection

Users reported a v5.3 performance regression and inability to establish
huge page mappings. A revised version of the ndctl "dax.sh" huge page
unit test identifies commit 23c84eb78375 "dax: Fix missed wakeup with
PMD faults" as the source.

Update get_unlocked_entry() to check for NULL entries before checking
the entry order, otherwise NULL is misinterpreted as a present pte
conflict. The 'order' check needs to happen before the locked check as
an unlocked entry at the wrong order must fallback to lookup the correct
order.
