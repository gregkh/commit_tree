mm/memcontrol.c: fix a -Wunused-function warning

mem_cgroup_id_get() was introduced in commit 73f576c04b94 ("mm:memcontrol:
fix cgroup creation failure after many small jobs").

Later, it no longer has any user since the commits,

1f47b61fb407 ("mm: memcontrol: fix swap counter leak on swapout from offline cgroup")
58fa2a5512d9 ("mm: memcontrol: add sanity checks for memcg->id.ref on get/put")

so safe to remove it.
