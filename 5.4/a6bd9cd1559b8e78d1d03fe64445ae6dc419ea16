btrfs: improve comments around nocow path

run_delalloc_nocow contains numerous, somewhat subtle, checks when
figuring out whether a particular extent should be CoW'ed or not. This
patch explicitly states the assumptions those checks verify. As a
result also document 2 of the more subtle checks in check_committed_ref
as well.
