ASoC: codec2codec: fix missing return of error return code

Currently in function snd_soc_dai_link_event_pre_pmu the error return
code in variable err is being set but this is not actually being returned,
the function just returns zero even when there are failures. Fix this by
returning the error return code.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
