net/ncsi: Disable global multicast filter

Disabling multicast filtering from NCSI if it is supported. As it
should not filter any multicast packets. In current code, multicast
filter is enabled and with an exception of optional field supported
by device are disabled filtering.

Mainly I see if goal is to disable filtering for IPV6 packets then let
it disabled for every other types as well. As we are seeing issues with
LLDP not working with this enabled filtering. And there are other issues
with IPV6.

By Disabling this multicast completely, it is working for both IPV6 as
well as LLDP.
