mm: page cache: store only head pages in i_pages

Transparent Huge Pages are currently stored in i_pages as pointers to
consecutive subpages.  This patch changes that to storing consecutive
pointers to the head page in preparation for storing huge pages more
efficiently in i_pages.

Large parts of this are "inspired" by Kirill's patch

Kirill and Huang Ying contributed several fixes.
