nbd: protect cmd->status with cmd->lock

We already do this for the most part, except in timeout and clear_req.
For the timeout case we take the lock after we grab a ref on the config,
but that isn't really necessary because we're safe to touch the cmd at
this point, so just move the order around.

For the clear_req cause this is initiated by the user, so again is safe.
