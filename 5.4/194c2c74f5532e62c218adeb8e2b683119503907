tracing: Get trace_array reference for available_tracers files

As instances may have different tracers available, we need to look at the
trace_array descriptor that shows the list of the available tracers for the
instance. But there's a race between opening the file and an admin
deleting the instance. The trace_array_get() needs to be called before
accessing the trace_array.
