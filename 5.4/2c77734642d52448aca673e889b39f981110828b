watchdog: meson: Fix the wrong value of left time

The left time value is wrong when we get it by sysfs. The left time value
should be equal to preset timeout value minus elapsed time value. According
to the Meson-GXB/GXL datasheets which can be found at [0], the timeout value
is saved to BIT[0-15] of the WATCHDOG_TCNT, and elapsed time value is saved
to BIT[16-31] of the WATCHDOG_TCNT.
