sunrpc: add a new cache_detail operation for when a cache is flushed

When the exports table is changed, exportfs will usually write a new
time to the "flush" file in the nfsd.export cache procfile. This tells
the kernel to flush any entries that are older than that value.

This gives us a mechanism to tell whether an unexport might have
occurred. Add a new ->flush cache_detail operation that is called after
flushing the cache whenever someone writes to a "flush" file.
