intel_th: msu: Fix overflow in shift of an unsigned int

The shift of the unsigned int win->nr_blocks by PAGE_SHIFT may
potentially overflow. Note that the intended return of this shift
is expected to be a size_t however the shift is being performed as
an unsigned int.  Fix this by casting win->nr_blocks to a size_t
before performing the shift.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unintentional integer overflow")
