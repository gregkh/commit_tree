bnxt_en: Adjust the time to wait before polling firmware readiness.

When firmware indicates that driver needs to invoke firmware reset
which is common for both error recovery and live firmware reset path,
driver needs a different time to wait before polling for firmware
readiness.

Modify the wait time to fw_reset_min_dsecs, which is initialised to
correct timeout for error recovery and firmware reset.
