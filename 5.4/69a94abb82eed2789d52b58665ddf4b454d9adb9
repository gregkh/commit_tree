export.h, genksyms: do not make genksyms calculate CRC of trimmed symbols

Arnd Bergmann reported false-positive modpost warnings detected by his
randconfig testing of linux-next.

Actually, this happens under the combination of CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
and CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS since commit 15bfc2348d54 ("modpost:
check for static EXPORT_SYMBOL* functions").

For example, arch/arm/config/multi_v7_defconfig + CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
+ CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS produces the following false-positives:

WARNING: "__lshrdi3" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__ashrdi3" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__aeabi_lasr" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__aeabi_llsr" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "ftrace_set_clr_event" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__muldi3" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__aeabi_ulcmp" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__ucmpdi2" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__aeabi_lmul" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__bswapsi2" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__bswapdi2" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__ashldi3" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)
WARNING: "__aeabi_llsl" [vmlinux] is a static (unknown)

The root cause of the problem is not in the modpost, but in the
implementation of CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS.

If there is at least one untrimmed symbol in the file, genksyms is
invoked to calculate CRC of *all* the exported symbols in that file
even if some of them have been trimmed due to no caller existing.

As a result, .tmp_*.ver files contain CRC of trimmed symbols, thus
unneeded, orphan __crc* symbols are added to objects. It had been
harmless until recently.

With commit 15bfc2348d54 ("modpost: check for static EXPORT_SYMBOL*
functions"), it is now harmful because the bogus __crc* symbols make
modpost call sym_update_crc() to add the symbols to the hash table,
but there is no one that clears the ->is_static member.

I gave Fixes to the first commit that uncovered the issue, but the
potential problem has long existed since commit f235541699bc
("export.h: allow for per-symbol configurable EXPORT_SYMBOL()").
