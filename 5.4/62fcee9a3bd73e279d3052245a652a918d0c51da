dma-mapping: remove CONFIG_ARCH_NO_COHERENT_DMA_MMAP

CONFIG_ARCH_NO_COHERENT_DMA_MMAP is now functionally identical to
!CONFIG_MMU, so remove the separate symbol.  The only difference is that
arm did not set it for !CONFIG_MMU, but arm uses a separate dma mapping
implementation including its own mmap method, which is handled by moving
the CONFIG_MMU check in dma_can_mmap so that is only applies to the
dma-direct case, just as the other ifdefs for it.
