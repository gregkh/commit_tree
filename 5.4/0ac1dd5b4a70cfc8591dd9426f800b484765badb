perf timechart: Refactor svg_build_topology_map()

Exchange the parameters of svg_build_topology_map() with 'struct
perf_env *env' and adjust the function accordingly.

This patch should not change any behavior, it is merely refactoring for
the following patch.

Committer notes:

No need to include env.h from svghelper.h, all it needs is a forward
declaration for 'struct perf_env', so move the include directive to
svghelper.c, where it is really needed.
