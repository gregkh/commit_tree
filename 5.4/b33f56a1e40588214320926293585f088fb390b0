staging: rtl8723bs: hal: remove redundant variable n

The variable n is being assigned a value that is never read inside
an if statement block, the assignment is redundant and can be removed.
With this removed, n is only being used for a constant loop bounds
check, so replace n with that value instead and remove n completely.
