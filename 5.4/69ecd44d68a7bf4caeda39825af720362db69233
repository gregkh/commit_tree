HID: multitouch: add support for the Smart Tech panel

This panel is not very friendly to us:
it exposes multiple multitouch collections, some of them being of
logical application stylus.

Usually, a device has only one report per application, and that is
what I assumed in commit 8dfe14b3b47f ("HID: multitouch: ditch mt_report_id")

To avoid breaking all working device, add a new class and a new quirk
for that situation.
