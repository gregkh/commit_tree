dma-mapping: provide a better default ->get_required_mask

Most dma_map_ops instances are IOMMUs that work perfectly fine in 32-bits
of IOVA space, and the generic direct mapping code already provides its
own routines that is intelligent based on the amount of memory actually
present.  Wire up the dma-direct routine for the ARM direct mapping code
as well, and otherwise default to the constant 32-bit mask.  This way
we only need to override it for the occasional odd IOMMU that requires
64-bit IOVA support, or IOMMU drivers that are more efficient if they
can fall back to the direct mapping.
