fscrypt: use FSCRYPT_ prefix for uapi constants

Prefix all filesystem encryption UAPI constants except the ioctl numbers
with "FSCRYPT_" rather than with "FS_".  This namespaces the constants
more appropriately and makes it clear that they are related specifically
to the filesystem encryption feature, and to the 'fscrypt_*' structures.
With some of the old names like "FS_POLICY_FLAGS_VALID", it was not
immediately clear that the constant had anything to do with encryption.

This is also useful because we'll be adding more encryption-related
constants, e.g. for the policy version, and we'd otherwise have to
choose whether to use unclear names like FS_POLICY_V1 or inconsistent
names like FS_ENCRYPTION_POLICY_V1.

For source compatibility with existing userspace programs, keep the old
names defined as aliases to the new names.

Finally, as long as new names are being defined anyway, I skipped
defining new names for the fscrypt mode numbers that aren't actually
used: INVALID (0), AES_256_GCM (2), AES_256_CBC (3), SPECK128_256_XTS
(7), and SPECK128_256_CTS (8).
