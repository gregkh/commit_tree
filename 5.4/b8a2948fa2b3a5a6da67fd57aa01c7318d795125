drm/panel: simple: Add ability to override typical timing

This patch adds the ability to override the typical display timing for a
given panel. This is useful for devices which have timing constraints
that do not apply across the entire display driver (eg: to avoid
crosstalk between panel and digitizer on certain laptops). The rules are
as follows:

- panel must not specify fixed mode (since the override mode will
  either be the same as the fixed mode, or we'll be unable to
  check the bounds of the overried)
- panel must specify at least one display_timing range which will be
  used to ensure the override mode fits within its bounds

Changes in v2:
 - Parse the full display-timings node (using the native-mode) (Rob)
Changes in v3:
 - No longer parse display-timings subnode, use panel-timing (Rob)
Changes in v4:
 - Don't add mode from timing if override was specified (Thierry)
 - Add warning if timing and fixed mode was specified (Thierry)
 - Don't add fixed mode if timing was specified (Thierry)
 - Refactor/rename a bit to avoid extra indentation from "if" tests
 - i should be unsigned (Thierry)
 - Add annoying WARN_ONs for some cases (Thierry)
 - Simplify 'No display_timing found' handling (Thierry)
 - Rename to panel_simple_parse_override_mode() (Thierry)
Changes in v5:
 - Added Heiko's Tested-by
Changes in v6:
 - Rebased to drm-misc next
 - Added tags
