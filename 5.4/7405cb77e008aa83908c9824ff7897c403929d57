drm/i915: Trust programmed MCR in read_subslice_reg

Instead of re-calculating the MCR selector in read_subslice_reg do the
rwm on its existing value and restore it when done.

This consolidates MCR programming to one place for cnl+, and avoids
re-calculating its default value on older platforms during hangcheck.
