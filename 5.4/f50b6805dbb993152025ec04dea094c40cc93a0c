8250-men-mcb: fix error checking when get_num_ports returns -ENODEV

The current checking for failure on the number of ports fails when
-ENODEV is returned from the call to get_num_ports. Fix this by making
num_ports and loop counter i signed rather than unsigned ints. Also
add check for num_ports being less than zero to check for -ve error
returns.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
