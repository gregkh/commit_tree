iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Move low-level queue fields out of arm_smmu_queue

In preparation for rewriting the command queue insertion code to use a
new algorithm, introduce a new arm_smmu_ll_queue structure which contains
only the information necessary to perform queue arithmetic for a queue
and will later be extended so that we can perform complex atomic
manipulation on some of the fields.

No functional change.
