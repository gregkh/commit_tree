iommu: Pass struct iommu_iotlb_gather to ->unmap() and ->iotlb_sync()

To allow IOMMU drivers to batch up TLB flushing operations and postpone
them until ->iotlb_sync() is called, extend the prototypes for the
->unmap() and ->iotlb_sync() IOMMU ops callbacks to take a pointer to
the current iommu_iotlb_gather structure.

All affected IOMMU drivers are updated, but there should be no
functional change since the extra parameter is ignored for now.
