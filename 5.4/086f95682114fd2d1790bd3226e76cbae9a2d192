bpf/flow_dissector: pass input flags to BPF flow dissector program

C flow dissector supports input flags that tell it to customize parsing
by either stopping early or trying to parse as deep as possible. Pass
those flags to the BPF flow dissector so it can make the same
decisions. In the next commits I'll add support for those flags to
our reference bpf_flow.c

v3:
* Export copy of flow dissector flags instead of moving (Alexei Starovoitov)
