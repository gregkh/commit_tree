dma-fence: Store the timestamp in the same union as the cb_list

The timestamp and the cb_list are mutually exclusive, the cb_list can
only be added to prior to being signaled (and once signaled we drain),
while the timestamp is only valid upon being signaled. Both the
timestamp and the cb_list are only valid while the fence is alive, and
as soon as no references are held can be replaced by the rcu_head.

By reusing the union for the timestamp, we squeeze the base dma_fence
struct to 64 bytes on x86-64.

v2: Sort the union chronologically
