xhci: Fix false warning message about wrong bounce buffer write length

The check printing out the "WARN Wrong bounce buffer write length:"
uses incorrect values when comparing bytes written from scatterlist
to bounce buffer. Actual copied lengths are fine.

The used seg->bounce_len will be set to equal new_buf_len a few lines later
in the code, but is incorrect when doing the comparison.

The patch which added this false warning was backported to 4.8+ kernels
so this should be backported as far as well.
