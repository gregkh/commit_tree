bus: ti-sysc: rework the reset handling

If reset controllers are assigned to the ti-sysc target-module, only
ti-sysc is going to be able to control these. Thus, remove all the
disable_on_idle flag usage, and assert/de-assert the reset always
in the idle path. Otherwise the reset signal will always just be
de-asserted.
