wimax/i2400m: remove debug containing bogus calculation of index

The subtraction of the two pointers is automatically scaled by the
size of the size of the object the pointers point to, so the division
by sizeof(*i2400m->barker) is incorrect.  This has been broken since
day one of the driver and is only debug, so remove the debug completely.

Also move && in condition to clean up a checkpatch warning.
