misc/sgi-gru: use mmu_notifier_get/put for struct gru_mm_struct

GRU is already using almost the same algorithm as get/put, it even
helpfully has a 10 year old comment to make this algorithm common, which
is finally happening.

There are a few differences and fixes from this conversion:
- GRU used rcu not srcu to read the hlist
- Unclear how the locking worked to prevent gru_register_mmu_notifier()
  from running concurrently with gru_drop_mmu_notifier() - this version is
  safe
- GRU had a release function which only set a variable without any locking
  that skiped the synchronize_srcu during unregister which looks racey,
  but this makes it reliable via the integrated call_srcu().
- It is unclear if the mmap_sem is actually held when
  __mmu_notifier_register() was called, lockdep will now warn if this is
  wrong
