ASoC: soc-component: add snd_soc_pcm_component_ioctrl()

Current ALSA SoC is directly using component->driver->ops->xxx,
thus, the code nested deeply, and it makes code difficult to read,
and is not good for encapsulation.

We want to implement component related function at soc-component.c,
but, some of them need to care whole snd_soc_pcm_runtime (= rtd)
connected component.

Let's call component related function which need to care with
for_each_rtdcom() loop as snd_soc_pcm_component_xxx().
This patch adds new snd_soc_pcm_component_ioctrl() and use it.
