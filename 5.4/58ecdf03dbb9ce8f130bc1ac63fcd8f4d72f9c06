firmware: arm_scmi: Add support for asynchronous commands and delayed response

Messages that are sent to platform, also known as commands and can be:

1. Synchronous commands that block the channel until the requested work
has been completed. The platform responds to these commands over the
same channel and hence can't be used to send another command until the
previous command has completed.

2. Asynchronous commands on the other hand, the platform schedules the
requested work to complete later in time and returns almost immediately
freeing the channel for new commands. The response indicates the success
or failure in the ability to schedule the requested work. When the work
has completed, the platform sends an additional delayed response message.

Using the same transmit buffer used for sending the asynchronous command
even for the delayed response corresponding to it simplifies handling of
the delayed response. It's the caller of asynchronous command that is
responsible for allocating the completion flag that scmi driver can
complete to indicate the arrival of delayed response.
