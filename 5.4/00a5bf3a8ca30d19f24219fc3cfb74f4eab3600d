RISC-V: Add PCIe I/O BAR memory mapping

For legacy I/O BARs (non-MMIO BARs) to work correctly on RISC-V Linux,
we need to establish a reserved memory region for them, so that drivers
that wish to use the legacy I/O BARs can issue reads and writes against
a memory region that is mapped to the host PCIe controller's I/O BAR
mapping.
