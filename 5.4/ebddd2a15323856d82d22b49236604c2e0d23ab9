sd: Set ELEVATOR_F_ZBD_SEQ_WRITE for ZBC disks

Using the helper blk_queue_required_elevator_features(), set the
elevator feature ELEVATOR_F_ZBD_SEQ_WRITE as required for the request
queue of SCSI ZBC disks.

This feature requirement can always be satisfied as the mq-deadline
elevator is always selected for in-kernel compilation when
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED (zoned block device support) is enabled.
