can: proc: give variables holding CAN statistics a sensible name

This patch rename the variables holding the CAN statistics (can_stats
and can_pstats) to pkg_stats and rcv_lists_stats which reflect better
their meaning.

The conversion is done with:

	sed -i \
		-e "s/can_stats\([^_]\)/pkg_stats\1/g" \
		-e "s/can_pstats/rcv_lists_stats/g" \
		net/can/proc.c
