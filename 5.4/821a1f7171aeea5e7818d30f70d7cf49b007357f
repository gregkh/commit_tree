dt-bindings: display: Convert common panel bindings to DT schema

Convert the common panel bindings to DT schema consolidating scattered
definitions to a single schema file.

The 'simple-panel' binding just a collection of properties and not a
complete binding itself. All of the 'simple-panel' properties are
covered by the panel-common.txt binding with the exception of the
'no-hpd' property, so add that to the schema.

As there are lots of references to simple-panel.txt, just keep the file
with a reference to common.yaml for now until all the bindings are
converted.
