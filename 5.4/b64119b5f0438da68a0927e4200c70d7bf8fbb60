Btrfs: remove unnecessary condition in btrfs_clone() to avoid too much nesting

The bulk of the work done when cloning extents, at ioctl.c:btrfs_clone(),
is done inside an if statement that checks if the found key has the type
BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY. That if statement is redundant however, because
btrfs_search_slot() always leaves us in a leaf slot that points to a key
that is always greater then or equals to the search key, and our search
key here has that type, and because we bail out before that if statement
if the key at the given leaf slot is greater then BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY.

Therefore just remove that if statement, not only because it is useless
but mostly because it increases the nesting/indentation level in this
function which is quite big and makes things a bit awkward whenever I need
to fix something that requires changing btrfs_clone() (and it has been
like that for many years already).
