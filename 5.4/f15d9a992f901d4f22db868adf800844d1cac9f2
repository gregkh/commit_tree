iommu/amd: Remove domain->updated

This struct member was used to track whether a domain
change requires updates to the device-table and IOMMU cache
flushes. The problem is, that access to this field is racy
since locking in the common mapping code-paths has been
eliminated.

Move the updated field to the stack to get rid of all
potential races and remove the field from the struct.
