    nbd: add multi-connection support

that limited the number of devices to 256. Before the patch we could
create 1000s of devices, but the patch switched us from using our
own thread to using a work queue which has a default limit of 256
active works.

The problem is that our recv_work function sits in a loop until
disconnection but only handles IO for one connection. The work is
started when the connection is started/restarted, but if we end up
creating 257 or more connections, the queue_work call just queues
connection257+'s recv_work and that waits for connection 1 - 256's
recv_work to be disconnected and that work instance completing.

Instead of reverting back to kthreads, this has us allocate a
workqueue_struct per device, so we can block in the work.
