s390/cio: fix intparm documentation

The common I/O layer is maintaining an "intparm" inspired by
the hardware intparm for driver usage. This "intparm" is not
only applicaple for ssch, but also for hsch/csch. The kerneldoc
states that it is only updated for hsch/csch if no prior request
is pending; however, this is not what the code does (whether
that would actually desireable is a different issue.)

Let's at least fix the kerneldoc for now.
