scsi: lpfc: fix 12.4.0.0 GPF at boot

The 12.4.0.0 patch that merged WQ/CQ pairs into single per-cpu pair
contained a bug: a local variable was set to the queue pair by index.  This
should have allowed the local variable to be natively used.  Instead, the
code reused the index relative to the local variable, obtaining a random
pointer value that when used eventually faulted the system

Convert offending code to use local variable.
