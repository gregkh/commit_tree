fuse: fix request limit

The size of struct fuse_req was reduced from 392B to 144B on a non-debug
config, thus the sanitize_global_limit() helper was setting a larger
default limit.  This doesn't really reflect reduction in the memory used by
requests, since the fields removed from fuse_req were added to fuse_args
derived structs; e.g. sizeof(struct fuse_writepages_args) is 248B, thus
resulting in slightly more memory being used for writepage requests
overalll (due to using 256B slabs).

Make the calculatation ignore the size of fuse_req and use the old 392B
value.
