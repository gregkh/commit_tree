libperf: Fix arch include paths

Guenter Roeck reported problem with compilation when the ARCH is
specified:

  $ make ARCH=x86_64
  In file included from tools/include/asm/atomic.h:6:0,
                   from include/linux/atomic.h:5,
                   from tools/include/linux/refcount.h:41,
                   from cpumap.c:4: tools/include/asm/../../arch/x86/include/asm/atomic.h:11:10:
  fatal error: asm/cmpxchg.h: No such file or directory

The problem is that we don't use SRCARCH (the sanitized ARCH version)
and we don't get the proper include path.
