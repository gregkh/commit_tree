EDAC/amd64: Initialize DIMM info for systems with more than two channels

Currently, the DIMM info for AMD Family 17h systems is initialized in
init_csrows(). This function is shared with legacy systems, and it has a
limit of two channel support.

This prevents initialization of the DIMM info for a number of ranks, so
there will be missing ranks in the EDAC sysfs.

Create a new init_csrows_df() for Family17h+ and revert init_csrows()
back to pre-Family17h support.

Loop over all channels in the new function in order to support systems
with more than two channels.
