ASoC: wm_adsp: Fix theoretical NULL pointer for alg_region

Fix potential NULL pointer dereference for alg_region in
wm_adsp_buffer_parse_legacy. In practice this can never happen as
loading the firmware should have failed at the wm_adsp2_setup_algs
stage, however probably better for the code to be robust against
future changes and this is more helpful for static analysis.
