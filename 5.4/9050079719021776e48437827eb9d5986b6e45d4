tty: serial: linflexuart: Fix magic SysRq handling

Following an incorrect indentation reported to me by Dan Carpenter, I
noticed that the SysRq lines were inherited from the lpuart driver[1] (note
how the 'continue' is aligned to 'sport->port.sysrq = 0') and we have never
actually tested the SysRq support.

'sport->sysrq = 0' is not necessary neither before nor after 'continue',
because sysrq will already be 0 after uart_handle_sysrq_char() will finish.
Also, since the LINFlexD driver never called uart_handle_break(), sysrq
would have never been set to a nonzero value, so uart_handle_sysrq_char()
was not going to do anything.

Break conditions are detected based on a null data byte along with a
framing error (stop bit sampled to 0).
