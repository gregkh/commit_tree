clk: ti: dm814x: Add of_node_put() to prevent memory leak

In function dm814x_adpll_early_init, variable np takes the value
returned by of_find_node_by_name, which gets a node but does not put it.
If np is not put before return, it may cause a memory leak. Hence put np
before return.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
