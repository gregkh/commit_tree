arm64/prefetch: fix a -Wtype-limits warning

The commit d5370f754875 ("arm64: prefetch: add alternative pattern for
CPUs without a prefetcher") introduced MIDR_IS_CPU_MODEL_RANGE() to be
used in has_no_hw_prefetch() with rv_min=0 which generates a compilation
warning from GCC,

Fix it by converting MIDR_IS_CPU_MODEL_RANGE to a static inline
function.
