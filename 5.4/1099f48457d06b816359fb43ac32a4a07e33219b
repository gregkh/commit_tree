ALSA: hda/realtek: Reduce the Headphone static noise on XPS 9350/9360

Headphone on XPS 9350/9360 produces a background white noise. The The
noise level somehow correlates with "Headphone Mic Boost", when it sets
to 1 the noise disappears. However, doing this has a side effect, which
also decreases the overall headphone volume so I didn't send the patch
upstream.

The noise was bearable back then, but after commit 717f43d81afc ("ALSA:
hda/realtek - Update headset mode for ALC256") the noise exacerbates to
a point it starts hurting ears.

So let's use the workaround to set "Headphone Mic Boost" to 1 and lock
it so it's not touchable by userspace.
