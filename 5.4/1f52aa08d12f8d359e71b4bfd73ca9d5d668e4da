gfs2: Convert gfs2 to fs_context

Convert gfs2 and gfs2meta to fs_context. Removes the duplicated vfs code
from gfs2_mount and instead uses the new vfs_get_block_super() before
switching the ->root to the appropriate dentry.

The mount option parsing has been converted to the new API and error
reporting for invalid options has been made more precise at the same
time.

All of the mount/remount code has been moved into ops_fstype.c
