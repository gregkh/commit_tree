powerpc/pseries/svm: Force SWIOTLB for secure guests

SWIOTLB checks range of incoming CPU addresses to be bounced and sees if
the device can access it through its DMA window without requiring bouncing.
In such cases it just chooses to skip bouncing. But for cases like secure
guests on powerpc platform all addresses need to be bounced into the shared
pool of memory because the host cannot access it otherwise. Hence the need
to do the bouncing is not related to device's DMA window and use of bounce
buffers is forced by setting swiotlb_force.

Also, connect the shared memory conversion functions into the
ARCH_HAS_MEM_ENCRYPT hooks and call swiotlb_update_mem_attributes() to
convert SWIOTLB's memory pool to shared memory.
