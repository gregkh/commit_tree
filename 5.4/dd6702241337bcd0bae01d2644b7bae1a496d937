posix-cpu-timers: Remove pointless comparisons

The soft RLIMIT expiry code checks whether the soft limit is greater than
the hard limit. That's pointless because if the soft RLIMIT is greater than
the hard RLIMIT then that code cannot be reached as the hard RLIMIT check
is before that and already killed the process.

Remove it.
