drop_monitor: Make drop queue length configurable

In packet alert mode, each CPU holds a list of dropped skbs that need to
be processed in process context and sent to user space. To avoid
exhausting the system's memory the maximum length of this queue is
currently set to 1000.

Allow users to tune the length of this queue according to their needs.
The configured length is reported to user space when drop monitor
configuration is queried.
