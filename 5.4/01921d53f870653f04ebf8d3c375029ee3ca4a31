drop_monitor: Document scope of spinlock

While 'per_cpu_dm_data' is a per-CPU variable, its 'skb' and
'send_timer' fields can be accessed concurrently by the CPU sending the
netlink notification to user space from the workqueue and the CPU
tracing kfree_skb(). This spinlock is meant to protect against that.

Document its scope and suppress the checkpatch message "spinlock_t
definition without comment".
