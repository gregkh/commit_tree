EDAC/amd64: Recognize DRAM device type ECC capability

AMD Family 17h systems support x4 and x16 DRAM devices. However, the
device type is not checked when setting mci.edac_ctl_cap.

Set the appropriate capability flag based on the device type.

Default to x8 DRAM device when neither the x4 or x16 bits are set.
