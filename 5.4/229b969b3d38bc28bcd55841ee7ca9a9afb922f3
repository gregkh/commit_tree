x86/apic: Initialize TPR to block interrupts 16-31

The APIC, per spec, is fundamentally confused and thinks that interrupt
vectors 16-31 are valid.  This makes no sense -- the CPU reserves vectors
0-31 for exceptions (faults, traps, etc).  Obviously, no device should
actually produce an interrupt with vector 16-31, but robustness can be
improved by setting the APIC TPR class to 1, which will prevent delivery of
an interrupt with a vector below 32.

Note: This is *not* intended as a security measure against attackers who
control malicious hardware.  Any PCI or similar hardware that can be
controlled by an attacker MUST be behind a functional IOMMU that remaps
interrupts.  The purpose of this change is to reduce the chance that a
certain class of device malfunctions crashes the kernel in hard-to-debug
ways.
