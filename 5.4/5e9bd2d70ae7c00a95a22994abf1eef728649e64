serial: uartps: Fix uartps_major handling

There are two parts which should be fixed. The first one is to assigned
uartps_major at the end of probe() to avoid complicated logic when
something fails.
The second part is initialized uartps_major number to 0 when last device is
removed. This will ensure that on next probe driver will ask for new
dynamic major number.
