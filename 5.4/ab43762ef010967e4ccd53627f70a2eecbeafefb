perf: Allow normal events to output AUX data

In some cases, ordinary (non-AUX) events can generate data for AUX events.
For example, PEBS events can come out as records in the Intel PT stream
instead of their usual DS records, if configured to do so.

One requirement for such events is to consistently schedule together, to
ensure that the data from the "AUX output" events isn't lost while their
corresponding AUX event is not scheduled. We use grouping to provide this
guarantee: an "AUX output" event can be added to a group where an AUX event
is a group leader, and provided that the former supports writing to the
latter.
