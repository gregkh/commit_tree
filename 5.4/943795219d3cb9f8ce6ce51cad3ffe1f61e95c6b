thunderbolt: Use 32-bit writes when writing ring producer/consumer

The register access should be using 32-bit reads/writes according to the
datasheet. With the previous generation hardware 16-bit writes have been
working but starting with ICL this is not the case anymore so fix
producer/consumer register update to use correct width register address.
