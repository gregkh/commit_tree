drm/i915/gt: Mark context->active_count as protected by timeline->mutex

We use timeline->mutex to protect modifications to
context->active_count, and the associated enable/disable callbacks.
Due to complications with engine-pm barrier there is a path where we used
a "superlock" to provide serialised protect and so could not
unconditionally assert with lockdep that it was always held. However,
we can mark the mutex as taken (noting that we may be nested underneath
ourselves) which means we can be reassured the right timeline->mutex is
always treated as held and let lockdep roam free.
