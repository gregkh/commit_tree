powerpc: Fix definition of PCR bits to work with old binutils

Commit 388cc6e133132 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Support POWER6
compatibility mode on POWER7") introduced new macros defining the PCR
bits. When used from assembly files these definitions lead to build
errors using older versions of binutils that don't support the 'ul'
suffix. This fixes the build errors by updating the definitions to use
the __MASK() macro which selects the appropriate suffix.
