drm/ttm: Add release_notify callback to ttm_bo_driver

This notifies the driver that a BO is about to be released.

Releasing a BO also invokes the move_notify callback from
ttm_bo_cleanup_memtype_use, but that happens too late for anything
that would add fences to the BO and require a delayed delete.
