perf tools: No need to include internal/lib.h from util/util.h

That was done just to have users of writen() and readn(), that before
had their prototypes in util/util.h to get it without having to add an
include for internal/lib.h, but the right way is to add it and by now
all places already do it.

Fix a fallout were readlink() was used but unistd.h was being obtained
by luck thru util.h -> internal/lib.h, now to check why unistd.h is
being included there...
