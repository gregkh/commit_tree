drm/i915: split out uncore_mmio_debug

Multiple uncore structures will share the debug infrastructure, so
move it to a common place and add extra locking around it.
Also, since we now have a separate object, it is cleaner to have
dedicated functions working on the object to stop and restart the
mmio debug. Apart from the cosmetic changes, this patch introduces
2 functional updates:

- All calls to check_for_unclaimed_mmio will now return false when
  the debug is suspended, not just the ones that are active only when
  i915_modparams.mmio_debug is set. If we don't trust the result of the
  check while a user is doing mmio access then we shouldn't attempt the
  check anywhere.

- i915_modparams.mmio_debug is not save/restored anymore around user
  access. The value is now never touched by the kernel while debug is
  disabled so no need for save/restore.

v2: squash mmio_debug patches, restrict mmio_debug lock usage (Chris)
