i2c: replace i2c_new_secondary_device with an ERR_PTR variant

In the general move to have i2c_new_*_device functions which return
ERR_PTR instead of NULL, this patch converts i2c_new_secondary_device().

There are only few users, so this patch converts the I2C core and all
users in one go. The function gets renamed to i2c_new_ancillary_device()
so out-of-tree users will get a build failure to understand they need to
adapt their error checking code.
