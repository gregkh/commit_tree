xprtrdma: Fix calculation of ri_max_segs again

Commit 302d3deb206 ("xprtrdma: Prevent inline overflow") added this
calculation back in 2016, but got it wrong. I tested only the lower
bound, which is why there is a max_t there. The upper bound should be
rounded up too.

Now, when using DIV_ROUND_UP, that takes care of the lower bound as
well.
