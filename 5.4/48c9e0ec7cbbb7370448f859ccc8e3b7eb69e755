rxrpc: Fix trace-after-put looking at the put call record

rxrpc_put_call() calls trace_rxrpc_call() after it has done the decrement
of the refcount - which looks at the debug_id in the call record.  But
unless the refcount was reduced to zero, we no longer have the right to
look in the record and, indeed, it may be deleted by some other thread.

Fix this by getting the debug_id out before decrementing the refcount and
then passing that into the tracepoint.
