drm/etnaviv: replace MMU flush marker with flush sequence

If a MMU is shared between multiple GPUs, all of them need to flush their
TLBs, so a single marker that gets reset on the first flush won't do.
Replace the flush marker with a sequence number, so that it's possible to
check if the TLB is in sync with the current page table state for each GPU.
