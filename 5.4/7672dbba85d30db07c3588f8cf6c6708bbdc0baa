drm: Add Content protection type property

This patch adds a DRM ENUM property to the selected connectors.
This property is used for mentioning the protected content's type
from userspace to kernel HDCP authentication.

Type of the stream is decided by the protected content providers.
Type 0 content can be rendered on any HDCP protected display wires.
But Type 1 content can be rendered only on HDCP2.2 protected paths.

So when a userspace sets this property to Type 1 and starts the HDCP
enable, kernel will honour it only if HDCP2.2 authentication is through
for type 1. Else HDCP enable will be failed.

Pekka have completed the Weston DRM-backend review in
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/merge_requests/48
and the UAPI for HDCP 2.2 looks good.

The userspace is accepted in Weston.
