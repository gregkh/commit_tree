mm: shrinker: make shrinker not depend on memcg kmem

Currently shrinker is just allocated and can work when memcg kmem is
enabled.  But, THP deferred split shrinker is not slab shrinker, it
doesn't make too much sense to have such shrinker depend on memcg kmem.
It should be able to reclaim THP even though memcg kmem is disabled.

Introduce a new shrinker flag, SHRINKER_NONSLAB, for non-slab shrinker.
When memcg kmem is disabled, just such shrinkers can be called in
shrinking memcg slab.
