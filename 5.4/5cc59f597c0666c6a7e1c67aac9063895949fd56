cpuidle-haltpoll: return -ENODEV on modinit failure

When a user loads cpuidle-haltpoll on a non KVM guest the module will
successfully load, even though idle driver registration didn't take
place.

We should instead return -ENODEV signaling the user that the driver can't
be loaded, like other error paths in haltpoll_init().  An example of such
error paths is when we return -EBUSY when attempting to register an idle
driver when it had one already (e.g. intel_idle loads at boot and then we
attempt to insert module cpuidle-haltpoll).
