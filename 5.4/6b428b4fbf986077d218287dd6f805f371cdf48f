net: hns3: fix some reset handshake issue

Currently, the driver sets handshake status to tell the hardware
that the driver have downed the netdev and it can continue with
reset process. The driver will clear the handshake status when
re-initializing the CMDQ, and does not recover this status
when reset fail, which may cause the hardware to wait for
the handshake status to be set and not being able to continue
with reset process.

So this patch delays clearing handshake status just before UP,
and recovers this status when reset fail.

BTW, this patch adds a new function hclge(vf)_reset_handshake() to
deal with the reset handshake issue, and renames
HCLGE(VF)_NIC_CMQ_ENABLE to HCLGE(VF)_NIC_SW_RST_RDY which
represents this register bit more accurately.
