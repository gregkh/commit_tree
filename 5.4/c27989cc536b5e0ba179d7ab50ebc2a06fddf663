dt-bindings: switch Exynos EHCI/OHCI bindings to use array of generic PHYs

Commit 69bec7259853 ("USB: core: let USB device know device node") added
support for attaching devicetree node for USB devices. Those nodes are
children of their USB host controller. However Exynos EHCI and OHCI
driver bindings already define child-nodes for each physical root hub
port and assigns respective PHY controller and parameters to them. This
leads to the conflict. A workaround for it has been merged as commit
01d4071486fe ("usb: exynos: add workaround for the USB device bindings
conflict"), but it disabled support for USB device binding for Exynos
EHCI/OHCI controllers.

To resolve it properly, lets move PHYs from the sub-nodes to a standard
array under the 'phys' property.
