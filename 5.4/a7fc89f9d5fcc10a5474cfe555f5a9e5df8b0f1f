gpio: thunderx: Switch to GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP

Use the new infrastructure for hierarchical irqchips in
gpiolib.

The major part of the rewrite was dues to the fact that
the driver was passing around a per-irq pointer to
struct thunderx_line * data container, and the central
handlers will assume struct gpio_chip * to be passed
to we need to use the hwirq as index to look up the
struct thunderx_line * for each IRQ.

The pushing and pop:ing of the irqdomain was confusing
because I've never seen this before, but I tried to
replicate it as best I could.

I have no chance to test or debug this so I need
help.
