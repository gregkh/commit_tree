drm/amd/display: Passive DP->HDMI dongle detection fix

[WHY]
i2c_read is called to differentiate passive DP->HDMI and DP->DVI-D dongles
The call is expected to fail in DVI-D case but pass in HDMI case
Some HDMI dongles have a chance to fail as well, causing misdetection as DVI-D

[HOW]
Retry i2c_read to ensure failed result is valid
