Revert "of/platform: Pause/resume sync state during init and of_platform_populate()"

This reverts commit 21871a99b34c65c56a24193c277a4981529c306f.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
