power: supply: sbs-battery: only return health when battery present

when the battery is set to sbs-mode and  no gpio detection is enabled
"health" is always returning a value even when the battery is not present.
All other fields return "not present".
This leads to a scenario where the driver is constantly switching between
"present" and "not present" state. This generates a lot of constant
traffic on the i2c.

This commit changes the response of "health" to an error when the battery
is not responding leading to a consistent "not present" state.
