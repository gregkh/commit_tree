net: mscc: ocelot: don't handle netdev events for other netdevs

The check that the event is actually for this device should be moved
from the "port" handler to the net device handler.

Otherwise the port handler will deny bonding configuration for other
net devices in the same system (like enetc in the LS1028A) that don't
have the lag_upper_info->tx_type restriction that ocelot has.
