s390/uaccess: avoid (false positive) compiler warnings

Depending on inlining decisions by the compiler, __get/put_user_fn
might become out of line. Then the compiler is no longer able to tell
that size can only be 1,2,4 or 8 due to the check in __get/put_user
resulting in false positives like

./arch/s390/include/asm/uaccess.h: In function ‘__put_user_fn’:
./arch/s390/include/asm/uaccess.h:113:9: warning: ‘rc’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  113 |  return rc;
      |         ^~
./arch/s390/include/asm/uaccess.h: In function ‘__get_user_fn’:
./arch/s390/include/asm/uaccess.h:143:9: warning: ‘rc’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  143 |  return rc;
      |         ^~

These functions are supposed to be always inlined. Mark it as such.
