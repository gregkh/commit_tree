mm/filemap.c: don't initiate writeback if mapping has no dirty pages

Functions like filemap_write_and_wait_range() should do nothing if inode
has no dirty pages or pages currently under writeback.  But they anyway
construct struct writeback_control and this does some atomic operations if
CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK=y - on fast path it locks inode->i_lock and
updates state of writeback ownership, on slow path might be more work.
Current this path is safely avoided only when inode mapping has no pages.

For example generic_file_read_iter() calls filemap_write_and_wait_range()
at each O_DIRECT read - pretty hot path.

This patch skips starting new writeback if mapping has no dirty tags set.
If writeback is already in progress filemap_write_and_wait_range() will
wait for it.
