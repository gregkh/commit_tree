crypto: caam - keep both virtual and dma key addresses

Update alginfo struct to keep both virtual and dma key addresses,
so that descriptors have them at hand.
One example where this is needed is in the xcbc(aes) shared descriptors,
which are updated in current patch.
Another example is the upcoming fix for DKP.
