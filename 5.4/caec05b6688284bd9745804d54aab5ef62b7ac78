Revert "of/platform: Disable generic device linking code for PowerPC"

This reverts commit 9c1c5e0bc5ec032e78bf15c302f3b20152f865ad.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
