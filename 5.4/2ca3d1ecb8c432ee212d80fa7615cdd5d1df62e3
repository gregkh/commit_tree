PM / wakeup: Register wakeup class kobj after device is added

The device_set_wakeup_enable() function can be called on a device that
hasn't been registered with device_add() yet. This allows the device to
be in a state where wakeup is enabled for it but the device isn't
published to userspace in sysfs yet.

After commit c8377adfa781 ("PM / wakeup: Show wakeup sources stats in
sysfs"), calling device_set_wakeup_enable() will fail for a device that
hasn't been registered with the driver core via device_add(). This is
because we try to create sysfs entries for the device and associate a
wakeup class kobject with it before the device has been registered.
Let's follow a similar approach that device_set_wakeup_capable() takes
here and register the wakeup class either from
device_set_wakeup_enable() when the device is already registered, or
from dpm_sysfs_add() when the device is being registered with the driver
core via device_add().
