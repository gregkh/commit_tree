firmware: stratix10-svc: extend svc to support new RSU features

Extend Intel Stratix10 service layer driver to support new RSU notify and
MAX_RETRY with watchdog event.

RSU is used to provide our customers with protection against loading bad
bitstream onto their devices when those devices are booting from flash

RSU notifies provides users with an API to notify the firmware of the
state of hard processor system.

To deal with watchdog event, RSU provides a way for user to retry the
current running image several times before giving up and starting normal
RSU failover flow.
