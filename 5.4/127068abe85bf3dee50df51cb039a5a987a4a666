i2c: qcom-geni: Disable DMA processing on the Lenovo Yoga C630

We have a production-level laptop (Lenovo Yoga C630) which is exhibiting
a rather horrific bug.  When I2C HID devices are being scanned for at
boot-time the QCom Geni based I2C (Serial Engine) attempts to use DMA.
When it does, the laptop reboots and the user never sees the OS.

Attempts are being made to debug the reason for the spontaneous reboot.
No luck so far, hence the requirement for this hot-fix.  This workaround
will be removed once we have a viable fix.
