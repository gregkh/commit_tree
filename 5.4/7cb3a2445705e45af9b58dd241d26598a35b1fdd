tools headers kvm: Sync kvm headers with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

    0cb8410b90e7 ("kvm: svm: Intercept RDPRU")

That trigger a rebuild in too in tooling:

    CC       /tmp/build/perf/arch/x86/util/kvm-stat.o

But this time around no changes in tooling results, as SVM_EXIT_RDPRU
wasn't added to SVM_EXIT_REASONS, that is used in kvm-stat.c.

And addresses this perf build warnings:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/svm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/svm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/svm.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/svm.h
