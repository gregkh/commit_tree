ALSA: usb-audio: Fix incorrect size check for processing/extension units

The recently introduced unit descriptor validation had some bug for
processing and extension units, it counts a bControlSize byte twice so
it expected a bigger size than it should have been.  This seems
resulting in a probe error on a few devices.

Fix the calculation for proper checks of PU and EU.
