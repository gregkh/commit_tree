Revert "driver core: Add sync_state driver/bus callback"

This reverts commit 8f8184d6bf676a8680d6f441e40317d166b46f73.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
