clk: ingenic: Use CLK_OF_DECLARE_DRIVER macro

By using CLK_OF_DECLARE_DRIVER instead of the CLK_OF_DECLARE macro, we
allow the driver to probe also as a platform driver.

While this driver does not have code to probe as a platform driver, this
is still useful for probing children devices in the case where the
device node is compatible with "simple-mfd".
