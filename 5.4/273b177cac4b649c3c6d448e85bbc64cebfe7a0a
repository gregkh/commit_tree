PCI: Move pci_[get|set]_resource_alignment_param() into their callers

Both the functions pci_get_resource_alignment_param() and
pci_set_resource_alignment_param() are now only called in one place:
resource_alignment_show() and resource_alignment_store() respectively.

There is no value in this extra set of functions so move both into their
callers respectively.
