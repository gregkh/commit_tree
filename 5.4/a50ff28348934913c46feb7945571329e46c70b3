leds: lm3692x: Use generic support for composing LED names

Switch to using generic LED support for composing LED class
device name.

At this occassion remove initialization of struct led_classdev's
dev->of_node property in the driver, since now it will be taken from
fwnode assigned to struct led_init_data and passed to the new
devm_led_classdev_register_ext() API.
