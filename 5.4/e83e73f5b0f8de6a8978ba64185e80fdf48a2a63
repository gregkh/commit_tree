rcu/nocb: Leave ->cblist enabled for no-CBs CPUs

As a first step towards making no-CBs CPUs use the ->cblist, this commit
leaves the ->cblist enabled for these CPUs.  The main reason to make
no-CBs CPUs use ->cblist is to take advantage of callback numbering,
which will reduce the effects of missed grace periods which in turn will
reduce forward-progress problems for no-CBs CPUs.
