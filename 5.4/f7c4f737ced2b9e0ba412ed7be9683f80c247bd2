HID: sb0540: add support for Creative SB0540 IR receivers

Add a new hid driver for the Creative SB0540 IR receiver. This receiver
is usually coupled with an RM-1500 or an RM-1800 remote control.

The scrollwheels on the RM-1800 remote are not bound, as they are
labelled for specific audio controls that don't usually exist on most
systems. They can be remapped using standard Linux keyboard
remapping tools.
