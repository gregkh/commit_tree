nfp: flower: remove offloaded MACs when reprs are applied to OvS bridges

MAC addresses along with an identifying index are offloaded to firmware to
allow tunnel decapsulation. If a tunnel packet arrives with a matching
destination MAC address and a verified index, it can continue on the
decapsulation process. This replicates the MAC verifications carried out
in the kernel network stack.

When a netdev is added to a bridge (e.g. OvS) then packets arriving on
that dev are directed through the bridge datapath instead of passing
through the network stack. Therefore, tunnelled packets matching the MAC
of that dev will not be decapped here.

Replicate this behaviour on firmware by removing offloaded MAC addresses
when a MAC representer is added to an OvS bridge. This can prevent any
false positive tunnel decaps.
