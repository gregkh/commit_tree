tracing/kprobe: Add multi-probe per event support

Add multi-probe per one event support to kprobe events.
User can define several different probes on one trace event
if those events have same "event signature",
e.g.

  # echo p:testevent _do_fork > kprobe_events
  # echo p:testevent fork_idle >> kprobe_events
  # kprobe_events
  p:kprobes/testevent _do_fork
  p:kprobes/testevent fork_idle

The event signature is defined by kprobe type (retprobe or not),
the number of args, argument names, and argument types.

Note that this only support appending method. Delete event
operation will delete all probes on the event.
