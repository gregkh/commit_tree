kernel/events/uprobes.c: only do FOLL_SPLIT_PMD for uprobe register

Attaching uprobe to text section in THP splits the PMD mapped page table
into PTE mapped entries.  On uprobe detach, we would like to regroup PMD
mapped page table entry to regain performance benefit of THP.

However, the regroup is broken For perf_event based trace_uprobe.  This
is because perf_event based trace_uprobe calls uprobe_unregister twice
on close: first in TRACE_REG_PERF_CLOSE, then in
TRACE_REG_PERF_UNREGISTER.  The second call will split the PMD mapped
page table entry, which is not the desired behavior.

Fix this by only use FOLL_SPLIT_PMD for uprobe register case.

Add a WARN() to confirm uprobe unregister never work on huge pages, and
abort the operation when this WARN() triggers.
