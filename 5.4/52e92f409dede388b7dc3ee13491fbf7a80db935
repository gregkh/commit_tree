perf/x86/cstate: Add Tiger Lake CPU support

Tiger Lake is the followon to Ice Lake. From the perspective of Intel
cstate residency counters, there is nothing changed compared with
Ice Lake.

Share icl_cstates with Ice Lake.
Update the comments for Tiger Lake.

The External Design Specification (EDS) is not published yet. It comes
from an authoritative internal source.

The patch has been tested on real hardware.
