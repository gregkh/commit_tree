KVM: x86: Expose XSAVEERPTR to the guest

I was surprised to see that the guest reported `fxsave_leak' while the
host did not. After digging deeper I noticed that the bits are simply
masked out during enumeration.

The XSAVEERPTR feature is actually a bug fix on AMD which means the
kernel can disable a workaround.

Pass XSAVEERPTR to the guest if available on the host.
