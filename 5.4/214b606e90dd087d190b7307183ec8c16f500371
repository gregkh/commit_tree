usb: exynos: add support for getting PHYs from the standard dt array

Add the code for getting generic PHYs from standard device tree array
from the main controller device node. This is a first step in resolving
the conflict between Exynos EHCI/OHCI sub-nodes and generic USB device
bindings. Later the sub-nodes currently used for assigning PHYs to root
ports of the controller will be removed making a place for the generic
USB device bindings nodes.
