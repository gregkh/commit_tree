dt-bindings: i2c: rcar: Rename bindings documentation file

Rename the bindings documentation file for R-Car I2C controller
from i2c-rcar.txt to renesas,rcar.txt.

This is part of an ongoing effort to name bindings documentation files for
Renesas IP blocks consistently, in line with the compat strings they
document.
