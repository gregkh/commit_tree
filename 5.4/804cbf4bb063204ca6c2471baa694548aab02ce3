ASoC: hdac_hda: fix page fault issue by removing race

There is a race between hda codec device removing and the
jack-detecting work, which will lead to a page fault issue as the
latter work is accessing codec device which could be already removed.

Here add the cancellation of jack-detecting work before codecs are actually
removed to avoid the race and fix the issue.
