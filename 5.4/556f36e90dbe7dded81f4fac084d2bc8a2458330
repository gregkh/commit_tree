blk-mq: balance mapping between present CPUs and queues

Spread queues among present CPUs first, then building mapping on other
non-present CPUs.

So we can minimize count of dead queues which are mapped by un-present
CPUs only. Then bad IO performance can be avoided by unbalanced mapping
between present CPUs and queues.

The similar policy has been applied on Managed IRQ affinity.
