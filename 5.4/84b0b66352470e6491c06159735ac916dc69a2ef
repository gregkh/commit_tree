zd1211rw: zd_usb: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct usb_int_regs {
	...
        struct reg_data regs[0];
} __packed;

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following function:

static int usb_int_regs_length(unsigned int count)
{
       return sizeof(struct usb_int_regs) + count * sizeof(struct reg_data);
}

with:

struct_size(regs, regs, count)
