can: mcp251x: mcp251x_restart_work_handler(): Fix potential force_quit race condition

In mcp251x_restart_work_handler() the variable to stop the interrupt
handler (priv->force_quit) is reset after the chip is restarted and thus
a interrupt might occur.

This patch fixes the potential race condition by resetting force_quit
before enabling interrupts.
