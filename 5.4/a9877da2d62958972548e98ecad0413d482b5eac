drm/i915/oa: Reconfigure contexts on the fly

Avoid a global idle barrier by reconfiguring each context by rewriting
them with MI_STORE_DWORD from the kernel context.

v2: We only need to determine the desired register values once, they are
the same for all contexts.
v3: Don't remove the kernel context from the list of known GEM contexts;
the world is not ready for that yet.
