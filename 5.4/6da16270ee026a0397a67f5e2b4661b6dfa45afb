drm/amd/display: populate last calculated bb state with max clocks

[why]
update_bounding_box calculates intermediate bb states based on clock relationship
however, the last state doesn't need to maintain a minimum relationship, but should
actually contain maximum of every clock.  otherwise maximum clocks are not usable

[how]
once the calculated bb is built, override the last state with max values
