perf trace: Allow specifying the bpf prog to augment specific syscalls

This is a step in the direction of being able to use a
BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY to handle syscalls that need to copy pointer
payloads in addition to the raw tracepoint syscall args.

There is a first example in
tools/perf/examples/bpf/augmented_raw_syscalls.c for the 'open' syscall.

Next step is to introduce the prog array map and use this 'open'
augmenter, then use that augmenter in other syscalls that also only copy
the first arg as a string, and then show how to use with a syscall that
reads more than one filename, like 'rename', etc.
