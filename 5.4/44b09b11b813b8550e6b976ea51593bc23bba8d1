clk: meson: gxbb: let sar_adc_clk_div set the parent clock rate

The meson-saradc driver manually sets the input clock for
sar_adc_clk_sel. Update the GXBB clock driver (which is used on GXBB,
GXL and GXM) so the rate settings on sar_adc_clk_div are propagated up
to sar_adc_clk_sel which will let the common clock framework select the
best matching parent clock if we want that.

This makes sar_adc_clk_div consistent with the axg-aoclk and g12a-aoclk
drivers, which both also specify CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT.
