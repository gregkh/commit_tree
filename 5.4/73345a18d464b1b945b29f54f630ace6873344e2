pinctrl: bcm2835: Pass irqchip when adding gpiochip

We need to convert all old gpio irqchips to pass the irqchip
setup along when adding the gpio_chip. For more info see
drivers/gpio/TODO.

For chained irqchips this is a pretty straight-forward
conversion. The BCM2835 has multiple parents so let's
exploit the new facility in the GPIO_IRQCHIP to actually
deal with multiple parents.
