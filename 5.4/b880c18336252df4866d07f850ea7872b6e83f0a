dt-bindings: cpufreq: Document allwinner,sun50i-h6-operating-points

Allwinner Process Voltage Scaling Tables defines the voltage and
frequency value based on the speedbin blown in the efuse combination.
The sunxi-cpufreq-nvmem driver reads the efuse value from the SoC to
provide the OPP framework with required information.
This is used to determine the voltage and frequency value for each
OPP of operating-points-v2 table when it is parsed by the OPP framework.

The "allwinner,sun50i-h6-operating-points" DT extends the
"operating-points-v2"
with following parameters:
- nvmem-cells (NVMEM area containig the speedbin information)
- opp-microvolt-<name>: voltage in micro Volts.
  At runtime, the platform can pick a <name> and matching
  opp-microvolt-<name> property.

                        sun50i-h6      speed0 speed1 speed2
