crypto: arm/aes-ce - switch to 4x interleave

When the ARM AES instruction based crypto driver was introduced, there
were no known implementations that could benefit from a 4-way interleave,
and so a 3-way interleave was used instead. Since we have sufficient
space in the SIMD register file, let's switch to a 4-way interleave to
align with the 64-bit driver, and to ensure that we can reach optimum
performance when running under emulation on high end 64-bit cores.
