perf probe: Fix to clear tev->nargs in clear_probe_trace_event()

Since add_probe_trace_event() can reuse tf->tevs[i] after calling
clear_probe_trace_event(), this can make perf-probe crash if the 1st
attempt of probe event finding fails to find an event argument, and the
2nd attempt fails to find probe point.

E.g.
  $ perf probe -D "task_pid_nr tsk"
  Failed to find 'tsk' in this function.
  Failed to get entry address of warn_bad_vsyscall
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Committer testing:

After the patch:

  $ perf probe -D "task_pid_nr tsk"
  Failed to find 'tsk' in this function.
  Failed to get entry address of warn_bad_vsyscall
  Failed to get entry address of signal_fault
  Failed to get entry address of show_signal
  Failed to get entry address of umip_printk
  Failed to get entry address of __bad_area_nosemaphore
  <SNIP>
  Failed to get entry address of sock_set_timeout
  Failed to get entry address of tcp_recvmsg
  Probe point 'task_pid_nr' not found.
    Error: Failed to add events.
