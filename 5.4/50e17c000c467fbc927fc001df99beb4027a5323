vfs: Add timestamp_truncate() api

timespec_trunc() function is used to truncate a
filesystem timestamp to the right granularity.
But, the function does not clamp tv_sec part of the
timestamps according to the filesystem timestamp limits.

The replacement api: timestamp_truncate() also alters the
signature of the function to accommodate filesystem
timestamp clamping according to flesystem limits.

Note that the tv_nsec part is set to 0 if tv_sec is not within
the range supported for the filesystem.
