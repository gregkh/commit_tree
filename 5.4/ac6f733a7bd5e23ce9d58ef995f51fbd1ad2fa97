ice: allow empty Rx descriptors

In some circumstances, the hardware will hand us a receive descriptor
which has no data attached, but is otherwise valid. The receive code was
improperly ignoring these descriptors, which result in an infinite loop.

To fix this, change the receive code to process all descriptors,
regardless of the size of the associated data. Add checks to the
memory-handling functions to allow for zero size.
