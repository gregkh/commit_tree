xhci: Check all endpoints for LPM timeout

If an endpoint is encountered that returns USB3_LPM_DEVICE_INITIATED, keep
checking further endpoints, as there might be periodic endpoints later
that return USB3_LPM_DISABLED due to shorter service intervals.

Without this, the code can set too high a maximum-exit-latency and
prevent the use of multiple USB3 cameras that should be able to work.
