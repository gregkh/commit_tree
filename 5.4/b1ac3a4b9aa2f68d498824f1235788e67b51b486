i3c: add addr and lvr to i2c_dev_desc structure

I need to store address and lvr value for I2C devices without static definition
in DT. This allows secondary master to transmit DEFSLVS command properly.

Main changes between v4 and v5:
- Change in defslvs to use addr and lvr from i2c_dev_desc structure
- Change in CDNS and DW drivers to use addr and lvr from i2c_dev_desc structure
