sefltest/ima: support appended signatures (modsig)

In addition to the PE/COFF and IMA xattr signatures, the kexec kernel
image can be signed with an appended signature, using the same
scripts/sign-file tool that is used to sign kernel modules.

This patch adds support for detecting a kernel image signed with an
appended signature and updates the existing test messages
appropriately.
