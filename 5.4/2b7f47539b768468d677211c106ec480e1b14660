iwlwifi: mvm: start to remove the code for d0i3

For runtime PM to work with d0i3 code, a lot of integration work needs
to be done with the platform (e.g. the out-of-band wake up interrupt)
and we currently don't have any platforms where this integration
happened.  So, this code has been pretty much stale for a while and
when someone enables it, it just breaks things.

Therefore, to simplify the code base and make sure no one enables this
by mistake, we will remove the whole code.

This is only the very start, much more work is needed.
Remove the places where we check iwl_mvm_is_d0i3_supported
but leave all the refs, those will be removed in a different
patch.
