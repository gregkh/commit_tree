rcu/nocb: Use separate flag to indicate disabled ->cblist

NULLing the RCU_NEXT_TAIL pointer was a clever way to save a byte, but
forward-progress considerations would require that this pointer be both
NULL and non-NULL, which, absent a quantum-computer port of the Linux
kernel, simply won't happen.  This commit therefore creates as separate
->enabled flag to replace the current NULL checks.
