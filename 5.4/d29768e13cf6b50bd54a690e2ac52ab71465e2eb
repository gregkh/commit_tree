powerpc/64s/exception: remove EXCEPTION_PROLOG_0/1, rename _2

EXCEPTION_PROLOG_0 and _1 have only a single caller, so expand them
into it.

Rename EXCEPTION_PROLOG_2_REAL to INT_SAVE_SRR_AND_JUMP and
EXCEPTION_PROLOG_2_VIRT to INT_VIRT_SAVE_SRR_AND_JUMP, which are
more descriptive.

No generated code change except BUG line number constants.
