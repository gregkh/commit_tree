r8169: make use of xmit_more

There was a previous attempt to use xmit_more, but the change had to be
reverted because under load sometimes a transmit timeout occurred [0].
Maybe this was caused by a missing memory barrier, the new attempt
keeps the memory barrier before the call to netif_stop_queue like it
is used by the driver as of today. The new attempt also changes the
order of some calls as suggested by Eric.
