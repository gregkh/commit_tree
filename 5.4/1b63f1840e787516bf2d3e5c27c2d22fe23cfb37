smb3: display max smb3 requests in flight at any one time

Displayed in /proc/fs/cifs/Stats once for each
socket we are connected to.

This allows us to find out what the maximum number of
requests that had been in flight (at any one time). Note that
/proc/fs/cifs/Stats can be reset if you want to look for
maximum over a small period of time.

Sample output (immediately after mount):

Resources in use
CIFS Session: 1
Share (unique mount targets): 2
SMB Request/Response Buffer: 1 Pool size: 5
SMB Small Req/Resp Buffer: 1 Pool size: 30
