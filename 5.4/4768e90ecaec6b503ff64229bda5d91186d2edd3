i2c: Add i2c-icy for I2C on m68k/Amiga

This is the i2c-icy driver for the ICY board for Amiga computers.
It connects a PCF8584 I2C controller to the Zorro bus, providing I2C
connectivity. The original documentation can be found on Aminet:

https://aminet.net/package/docs/hard/icy

IRQ support is currently not implemented, as i2c-algo-pcf is built for
the ISA bus and a straight implementation of the same stack locks up a
Zorro machine.
