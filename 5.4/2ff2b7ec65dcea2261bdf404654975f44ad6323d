kbuild: add CONFIG_ASM_MODVERSIONS

Add CONFIG_ASM_MODVERSIONS. This allows to remove one if-conditional
nesting in scripts/Makefile.build.

scripts/Makefile.build is run every time Kbuild descends into a
sub-directory. So, I want to avoid $(wildcard ...) evaluation
where possible although computing $(wildcard ...) is so cheap that
it may not make measurable performance difference.
