erspan: fix the tun_info options_len check for erspan

The check for !md doens't really work for ip_tunnel_info_opts(info) which
only does info + 1. Also to avoid out-of-bounds access on info, it should
ensure options_len is not less than erspan_metadata in both erspan_xmit()
and ip6erspan_tunnel_xmit().
