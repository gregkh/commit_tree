kvm: nvmx: limit atomic switch MSRs

Allowing an unlimited number of MSRs to be specified via the VMX
load/store MSR lists (e.g., vm-entry MSR load list) is bad for two
reasons. First, a guest can specify an unreasonable number of MSRs,
forcing KVM to process all of them in software. Second, the SDM bounds
the number of MSRs allowed to be packed into the atomic switch MSR lists.
Quoting the "Miscellaneous Data" section in the "VMX Capability
Reporting Facility" appendix:

"Bits 27:25 is used to compute the recommended maximum number of MSRs
that should appear in the VM-exit MSR-store list, the VM-exit MSR-load
list, or the VM-entry MSR-load list. Specifically, if the value bits
27:25 of IA32_VMX_MISC is N, then 512 * (N + 1) is the recommended
maximum number of MSRs to be included in each list. If the limit is
exceeded, undefined processor behavior may result (including a machine
check during the VMX transition)."

Because KVM needs to protect itself and can't model "undefined processor
behavior", arbitrarily force a VM-entry to fail due to MSR loading when
the MSR load list is too large. Similarly, trigger an abort during a VM
exit that encounters an MSR load list or MSR store list that is too large.

The MSR list size is intentionally not pre-checked so as to maintain
compatibility with hardware inasmuch as possible.

Test these new checks with the kvm-unit-test "x86: nvmx: test max atomic
switch MSRs".
