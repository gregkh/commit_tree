drm/prime: Update docs

Yes this is a bit a big patch, but since it's essentially a complete
rewrite of all the prime docs I didn't see how to better split it up.

Changes:
- Consistently point to drm_gem_object_funcs as the preferred hooks,
  where applicable.

- Document all the hooks in &drm_driver that lacked kerneldoc.

- Completely new overview section, which now also includes the cleaned
  up lifetime/reference counting subchapter. I also mentioned the weak
  references in there due to the lookup caches.

- Completely rewritten helper intro section, highlight the
  import/export related functionality.

- Polish for all the functions and more cross references.

I also sprinkled a bunch of todos all over.

Most important: 0 code changes in here. The cleanup motivated by
reading and improving all this will follow later on.

v2: Actually update the prime helper docs. Plus add a few FIXMEs that
I won't address right away in subsequent cleanup patches.

v3:
- Split out the function moving. This patch is now exclusively
  documentation changes.
- Typos and nits (Sam).

v4: Polish suggestions from Noralf.
