ice: Always notify FW of VF reset

The call to ice_dis_vsi_txq() acts as the notification to the firmware
that the VF is being reset. Because of this, we need to make this call
every time we reset, regardless of whatever else we do to stop the Tx
queues.

Without this change, VF resets would fail to complete on interfaces that
were up and running.
