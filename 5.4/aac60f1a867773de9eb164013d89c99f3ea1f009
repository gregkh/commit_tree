KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Use the appropriate TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH

Commit 49dfe94fe5ad ("KVM: arm/arm64: Fix TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH") fixes
TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH to the correct relative path to the define_trace.h
and explains why did the old one work.

The same fix should be applied to virt/kvm/arm/vgic/trace.h.
