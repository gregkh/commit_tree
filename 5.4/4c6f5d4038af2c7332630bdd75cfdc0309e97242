ARM: defconfig: enable cpufreq driver for RPi

This enables on both multi_v7_defconfig and bcm2835_defconfig the new
firmware based clock and cpufreq drivers for the Raspberry Pi platform.

In the case of bcm2835_defconfig, as the cpufreq subsystem was disabled,
the conservative governor was selected as default since it better
handles the high frequency transition latency.
