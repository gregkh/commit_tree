serial: lantiq: Make IRQ & ISR assignment dynamic

This driver/IP is reused across multiple SoCs. Older SoCs supported three
separate IRQs for tx, rx & err interrupts. Newer Lightning Mountain SoC
supports single IRQ for all of tx/rx/err interrupts. This patch modifies
the driver design to support dynamic assignment of IRQ resources & ISRs
based on devicetree node compatible entries.
