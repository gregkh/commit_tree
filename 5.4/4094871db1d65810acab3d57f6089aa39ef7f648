udp: only do GSO if # of segs > 1

Prior to this change an application sending <= 1MSS worth of data and
enabling UDP GSO would fail if the system had SW GSO enabled, but the
same send would succeed if HW GSO offload is enabled. In addition to this
inconsistency the error in the SW GSO case does not get back to the
application if sending out of a real device so the user is unaware of this
failure.

With this change we only perform GSO if the # of segments is > 1 even
if the application has enabled segmentation. I've also updated the
relevant udpgso selftests.
