PM: QoS: Invalidate frequency QoS requests after removal

Switching cpufreq drivers (or switching operation modes of the
intel_pstate driver from "active" to "passive" and vice versa)
does not work on some x86 systems with ACPI after commit
3000ce3c52f8 ("cpufreq: Use per-policy frequency QoS"), because
the ACPI _PPC and thermal code uses the same frequency QoS request
object for a given CPU every time a cpufreq driver is registered
and freq_qos_remove_request() does not invalidate the request after
removing it from its QoS list, so freq_qos_add_request() complains
and fails when that request is passed to it again.

Fix the issue by modifying freq_qos_remove_request() to clear the qos
and type fields of the frequency request pointed to by its argument
after removing it from its QoS list so as to invalidate it.
