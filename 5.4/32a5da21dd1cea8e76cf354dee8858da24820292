arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Node ordering, address cleanups

DT nodes should be ordered by address, then node name, and finally label.
The msm8998 dtsi does not follow this, so clean it up by reordering the
nodes.  While we are at it, extend the addresses to be fully 32-bits wide
so that ordering is easy to determine when adding new nodes.  Also, two
or so nodes had the wrong address value in their node name (did not match
the reg property), so fix those up as well.

Hopefully going forward, things can be maintained so that a cleanup like
this is not needed.
