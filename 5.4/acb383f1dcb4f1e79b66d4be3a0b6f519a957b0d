staging: erofs: fix an error handling in erofs_readdir()

Richard observed a forever loop of erofs_read_raw_page() [1]
which can be generated by forcely setting ->u.i_blkaddr
to 0xdeadbeef (as my understanding block layer can
handle access beyond end of device correctly).

After digging into that, it seems the problem is highly
related with directories and then I found the root cause
is an improper error handling in erofs_readdir().

Let's fix it now.
