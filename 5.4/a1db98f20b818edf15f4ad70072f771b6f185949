erofs: fix compile warnings when moving out include/trace/events/erofs.h

As Stephon reported [1], many compile warnings are raised when
moving out include/trace/events/erofs.h:

In file included from include/trace/events/erofs.h:8,
                 from <command-line>:
include/trace/events/erofs.h:28:37: warning: 'struct dentry' declared inside parameter list will not be visible outside of this definition or declaration
  TP_PROTO(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, unsigned int flags),

That makes me very confused since most original EROFS tracepoint code
was taken from f2fs, and finally I found

commit 43c78d88036e ("kbuild: compile-test kernel headers to ensure they are self-contained")

It seems these warnings are generated from KERNEL_HEADER_TEST feature and
ext4/f2fs tracepoint files were in blacklist.

Anyway, let's fix these issues for KERNEL_HEADER_TEST feature instead
of adding to blacklist...
