net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: complete ATU state definitions

Marvell has different values for the state of a MAC address,
depending on its multicast bit. This patch completes the definitions
for these states.

At the same time, use 0 which is intuitive enough and simplifies the
code a bit, instead of the UC or MC unused value.
