staging: erofs: xattr.c: avoid BUG_ON

Kill all the remaining BUG_ON in EROFS:
 - one BUG_ON was used to detect xattr on-disk corruption,
   proper error handling should be added for it instead;
 - the other BUG_ONs are used to detect potential issues,
   use DBG_BUGON only in (eng) debugging version.
