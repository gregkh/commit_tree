mm, page_owner: fix off-by-one error in __set_page_owner_handle()

Patch series "followups to debug_pagealloc improvements through
page_owner", v3.

These are followups to [1] which made it to Linus meanwhile.  Patches 1
and 3 are based on Kirill's review, patch 2 on KASAN request [2].  It
would be nice if all of this made it to 5.4 with [1] already there (or
at least Patch 1).

This patch (of 3):

As noted by Kirill, commit 7e2f2a0cd17c ("mm, page_owner: record page
owner for each subpage") has introduced an off-by-one error in
__set_page_owner_handle() when looking up page_ext for subpages.  As a
result, the head page page_owner info is set twice, while for the last
tail page, it's not set at all.

Fix this and also make the code more efficient by advancing the page_ext
pointer we already have, instead of calling lookup_page_ext() for each
subpage.  Since the full size of struct page_ext is not known at compile
time, we can't use a simple page_ext++ statement, so introduce a
page_ext_next() inline function for that.
