powerpc/eeh: Fix crash when edev->pdev changes

If a PCI device is removed during eeh_pe_report_edev(), between the
calls to device_lock() and device_unlock(), edev->pdev will change and
cause a crash as the wrong mutex is released.

To correct this, hold the PCI rescan/remove lock while taking a copy
of edev->pdev and performing a get_device() on it.  Use this value to
release the mutex, but also pass it through to the device driver's EEH
handlers so that they always see the same device.
