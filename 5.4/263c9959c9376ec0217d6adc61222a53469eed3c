crypto: hisilicon - add queue management driver for HiSilicon QM module

QM is a general IP used by HiSilicon accelerators. It provides a general
PCIe interface for the CPU and the accelerator to share a group of queues.

A QM integrated in an accelerator provides queue management service.
Queues can be assigned to PF and VFs, and queues can be controlled by
unified mailboxes and doorbells. Specific task request are descripted by
specific description buffer, which will be controlled and pass to related
accelerator IP by QM.

This patch adds a QM driver used by the accelerator driver to access
the QM hardware.
