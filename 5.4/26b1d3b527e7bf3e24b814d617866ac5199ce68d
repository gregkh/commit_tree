drm/atomic: Take the atomic toys away from X

The -modesetting ddx has a totally broken idea of how atomic works:
- doesn't disable old connectors, assuming they get auto-disable like
  with the legacy setcrtc
- assumes ASYNC_FLIP is wired through for the atomic ioctl
- not a single call to TEST_ONLY

Iow the implementation is a 1:1 translation of legacy ioctls to
atomic, which is a) broken b) pointless.

We already have bugs in both i915 and amdgpu-DC where this prevents us
from enabling neat features.

If anyone ever cares about atomic in X we can easily add a new atomic
level (req->value == 2) for X to get back the shiny toys.

Since these broken versions of -modesetting have been shipping,
there's really no other way to get out of this bind.

v2:
- add an informational dmesg output (Rob, Ajax)
- reorder after the DRIVER_ATOMIC check to avoid useless noise (Ilia)
- allow req->value > 2 so that X can do another attempt at atomic in
  the future

v3: Go with paranoid, insist that the X should be first (suggested by
Rob)
