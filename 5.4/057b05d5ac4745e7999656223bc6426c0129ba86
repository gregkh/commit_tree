dmaengine: qcom: hidma_mgmt: Add of_node_put() before goto

Each iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node puts the previous
node, but in the case of a goto from the middle of the loop, there is
no put, thus causing a memory leak.
Hence add an of_node_put under the label that the gotos point to.
In order to avoid decrementing an already-decremented refcount, copy the
original contents of the label (including the return statement) to just
above the label, so that the code under the label is executed only when
a goto exit from the loop occurs.
Additionally, remove an unnecessary get/put pair from the loop, as the
loop itself already keeps track of refcount.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
