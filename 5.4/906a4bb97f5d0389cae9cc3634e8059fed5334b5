crypto: sha256 - Use get/put_unaligned_be32 to get input, memzero_explicit

Use get/put_unaligned_be32 in lib/crypto/sha256.c to load / store data
so that it can be used with unaligned buffers too, making it more generic.

And use memzero_explicit for better clearing of sensitive data.

Note unlike other patches in this series this commit actually makes
functional changes to the sha256 code as used by the purgatory code.

This fully aligns the lib/crypto/sha256.c sha256 implementation with the
one from crypto/sha256_generic.c allowing us to remove the latter in
further patches in this series.
