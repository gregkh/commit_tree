platform/x86: i2c-multi-instantiate: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array.

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.
