ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Disable DMI L1 entry during capture

There is a known issue on some Intel platforms which causes
pause/release to run into xrun's during capture usecases.
The suggested workaround to address the issue is to
disable the entry of lower power L1 state in the physical
DMI link when there is a capture stream open.
