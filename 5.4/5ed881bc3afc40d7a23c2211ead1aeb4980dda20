riscv: add missing header file includes

sparse identifies several missing prototypes caused by missing
preprocessor include directives:

arch/riscv/kernel/cpufeature.c:16:6: warning: symbol 'has_fpu' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kernel/process.c:26:6: warning: symbol 'arch_cpu_idle' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kernel/reset.c:15:6: warning: symbol 'pm_power_off' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kernel/syscall_table.c:15:6: warning: symbol 'sys_call_table' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kernel/traps.c:149:13: warning: symbol 'trap_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kernel/vdso.c:54:5: warning: symbol 'arch_setup_additional_pages' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kernel/smp.c:64:6: warning: symbol 'arch_match_cpu_phys_id' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kernel/module-sections.c:89:5: warning: symbol 'module_frob_arch_sections' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/mm/context.c:42:6: warning: symbol 'switch_mm' was not declared. Should it be static?

Fix by including the appropriate header files in the appropriate
source files.

This patch should have no functional impact.
