drm/i915/tgl: MOCS table update

The bspec was just updated with a minor correction to entry 61 (it
shouldn't have had the SCF bit set).

v2:
 - Add a MOCS_ENTRY_UNUSED() and use it to declare the
   explicitly-reserved MOCS entries. (Lucas)
 - Move the warning suppression from the Makefile to a #pragma that only
   affects the TGL table. (Lucas)

v3:
 - Entries 16 and 17 are identical to ICL now, so no need to explicitly
   adjust them (or mess with compiler warning overrides).

Bspec: 45101
Fixes: 2ddf992179c4 ("drm/i915/tgl: Define MOCS entries for Tigerlake")
