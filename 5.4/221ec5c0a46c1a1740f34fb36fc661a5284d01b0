mm: slab: make page_cgroup_ino() to recognize non-compound slab pages properly

page_cgroup_ino() doesn't return a valid memcg pointer for non-compound
slab pages, because it depends on PgHead AND PgSlab flags to be set to
determine the memory cgroup from the kmem_cache.  It's correct for
compound pages, but not for generic small pages.  Those don't have PgHead
set, so it ends up returning zero.

Fix this by replacing the condition to PageSlab() && !PageTail().

Before this patch:
  [root@localhost ~]# ./page-types -c /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-0.slice/user@0.service/ | grep slab
  0x0000000000000080	        38        0  _______S___________________________________	slab

After this patch:
  [root@localhost ~]# ./page-types -c /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-0.slice/user@0.service/ | grep slab
  0x0000000000000080	       147        0  _______S___________________________________	slab

Also, hwpoison_filter_task() uses output of page_cgroup_ino() in order
to filter error injection events based on memcg.  So if
page_cgroup_ino() fails to return memcg pointer, we just fail to inject
memory error.  Considering that hwpoison filter is for testing, affected
users are limited and the impact should be marginal.
