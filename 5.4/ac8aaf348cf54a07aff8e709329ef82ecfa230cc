firmware: arm_scmi: Add discovery of SCMI v2.0 performance fastchannels

SCMI v2.0 adds support for "FastChannel", a lightweight unidirectional
channel that is dedicated to a single SCMI message type for controlling
a specific platform resource. They do not use a message header as they
are specialized for a single message.

Only PERFORMANCE_LIMITS_{SET,GET} and PERFORMANCE_LEVEL_{SET,GET}
commands are supported over fastchannels. As they are optional, they
need to be discovered by PERFORMANCE_DESCRIBE_FASTCHANNEL command.
Further {LIMIT,LEVEL}_SET commands can have optional doorbell support.

Add support for discovery of these fastchannels.
