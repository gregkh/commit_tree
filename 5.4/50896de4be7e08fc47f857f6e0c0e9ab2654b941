KVM: x86: always expose VIRT_SSBD to guests

Even though it is preferrable to use SPEC_CTRL (represented by
X86_FEATURE_AMD_SSBD) instead of VIRT_SPEC, VIRT_SPEC is always
supported anyway because otherwise it would be impossible to
migrate from old to new CPUs.  Make this apparent in the
result of KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID as well.

However, we need to hide the bit on Intel processors, so move
the setting to svm_set_supported_cpuid.
