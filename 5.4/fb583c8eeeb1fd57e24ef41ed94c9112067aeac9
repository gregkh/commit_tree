driver core: Fix creation of device links with PM-runtime flags

After commit 515db266a9da ("driver core: Remove device link creation
limitation"), if PM-runtime flags are passed to device_link_add(), it
will fail (returning NULL) due to an overly restrictive flags check
introduced by that commit.

Fix this issue by extending the check in question to cover the
PM-runtime flags too.
