net/ipv4: fix sysctl max for fib_multipath_hash_policy

Commit eec4844fae7c ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
check") did:
-               .extra2         = &two,
+               .extra2         = SYSCTL_ONE,
here, which doesn't seem to be intentional, given the changelog.
This patch restores it to the previous, as the value of 2 still makes
sense (used in fib_multipath_hash()).
