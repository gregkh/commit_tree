ALSA: i2c: ak4xxx-adda: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in build_adc_controls()

In build_adc_controls(), there is an if statement on line 773 to check
whether ak->adc_info is NULL:
    if (! ak->adc_info ||
        ! ak->adc_info[mixer_ch].switch_name)

When ak->adc_info is NULL, it is used on line 792:
    knew.name = ak->adc_info[mixer_ch].selector_name;

Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.

To fix this bug, referring to lines 773 and 774, ak->adc_info
and ak->adc_info[mixer_ch].selector_name are checked before being used.

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
