net/mlx5e: Eswitch, use state_lock to synchronize vlan change

esw->state_lock is already used to protect vlan vport configuration change.
However, all preparation and correctness checks, and code that sets vport
data are not protected by this lock and assume external synchronization by
rtnl lock. In order to remove dependency on rtnl lock, extend
esw->state_lock protection to whole eswitch vlan add/del functions.
