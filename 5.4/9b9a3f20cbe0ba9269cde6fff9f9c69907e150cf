kbuild: split final module linking out into Makefile.modfinal

I think splitting the modpost and linking modules into separate
Makefiles will be useful especially when more complex build steps
come in. The main motivation of this commit is to integrate the
proposed klp-convert feature cleanly.

I moved the logging 'Building modules, stage 2.' to Makefile.modpost
to avoid the code duplication although I do not know whether or not
this message is needed in the first place.
