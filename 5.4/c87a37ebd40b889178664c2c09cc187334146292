9p: avoid attaching writeback_fid on mmap with type PRIVATE

Currently on mmap cache policy, we always attach writeback_fid
whether mmap type is SHARED or PRIVATE. However, in the use case
of kata-container which combines 9p(Guest OS) with overlayfs(Host OS),
this behavior will trigger overlayfs' copy-up when excute command
inside container.
