crypto: caam - make sure clocks are enabled first

In order to access IP block's registers we need to enable appropriate
clocks first, otherwise we are risking hanging the CPU.

The problem becomes very apparent when trying to use CAAM driver built
as a kernel module. In that case caam_probe() gets called after
clk_disable_unused() which means all of the necessary clocks are
guaranteed to be disabled.

Coincidentally, this change also fixes iomap leak introduced by early
return (instead of "goto iounmap_ctrl") in commit
41fc54afae70 ("crypto: caam - simplfy clock initialization")

Tested on ZII i.MX6Q+ RDU2
