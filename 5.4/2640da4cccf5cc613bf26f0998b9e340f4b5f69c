x86/apic: Soft disable APIC before initializing it

If the APIC was already enabled on entry of setup_local_APIC() then
disabling it soft via the SPIV register makes a lot of sense.

That masks all LVT entries and brings it into a well defined state.

Otherwise previously enabled LVTs which are not touched in the setup
function stay unmasked and might surprise the just booting kernel.
