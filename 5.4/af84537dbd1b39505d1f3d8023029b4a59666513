SUNRPC: fix race to sk_err after xs_error_report

Since commit 4f8943f80883 ("SUNRPC: Replace direct task wakeups from
softirq context") there has been a race to the value of the sk_err if both
XPRT_SOCK_WAKE_ERROR and XPRT_SOCK_WAKE_DISCONNECT are set.  In that case,
we may end up losing the sk_err value that existed when xs_error_report was
called.

Fix this by reverting to the previous behavior: instead of using SO_ERROR
to retrieve the value at a later time (which might also return sk_err_soft),
copy the sk_err value onto struct sock_xprt, and use that value to wake
pending tasks.
