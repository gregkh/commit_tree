KVM: selftests: Split ucall.c into architecture specific files

The way we exit from a guest to userspace is very specific to the
architecture: On x86, we use PIO, on aarch64 we are using MMIO and on
s390x we're going to use an instruction instead. The possibility to
select a type via the ucall_type_t enum is currently also completely
unused, so the code in ucall.c currently looks more complex than
required. Let's split this up into architecture specific ucall.c
files instead, so we can get rid of the #ifdefs and the unnecessary
ucall_type_t handling.
