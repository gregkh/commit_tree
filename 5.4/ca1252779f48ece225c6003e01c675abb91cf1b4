perf evsel: Introduce evsel_fprintf.h

We already had evsel_fprintf.c, add its counterpart, so that we can
reduce evsel.h a bit more.

We needed a new perf_event_attr_fprintf.c file so as to have a separate
object to link with the python binding in tools/perf/util/python-ext-sources
and not drag symbol_conf, etc into the python binding.
