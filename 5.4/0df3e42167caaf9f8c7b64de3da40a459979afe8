PCI: rpaphp: Avoid a sometimes-uninitialized warning

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, clang warns:

drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_core.c:243:14: warning: variable 'fndit' is
used uninitialized whenever 'for' loop exits because its condition is
false [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
        for (j = 0; j < entries; j++) {
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_core.c:256:6: note: uninitialized use occurs
here
        if (fndit)
            ^~~~~
drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_core.c:243:14: note: remove the condition if
it is always true
        for (j = 0; j < entries; j++) {
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_core.c:233:14: note: initialize the variable
'fndit' to silence this warning
        int j, fndit;
                    ^
                     = 0

fndit is only used to gate a sprintf call, which can be moved into the
loop to simplify the code and eliminate the local variable, which will
fix this warning.
