btrfs: treat RWF_{,D}SYNC writes as sync for CRCs

The VFS indicates a synchronous write to ->write_iter() via
iocb->ki_flags. The IOCB_{,D}SYNC flags may be set based on the file
(see iocb_flags()) or the RWF_* flags passed to a syscall like
pwritev2() (see kiocb_set_rw_flags()).

However, in btrfs_file_write_iter(), we're checking if a write is
synchronous based only on the file; we use this to decide when to bump
the sync_writers counter and thus do CRCs synchronously. Make sure we do
this for all synchronous writes as determined by the VFS.
