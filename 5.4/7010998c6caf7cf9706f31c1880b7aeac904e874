nl80211: add NL80211_CMD_UPDATE_FT_IES to supported commands

Add NL80211_CMD_UPDATE_FT_IES to supported commands. In mac80211 drivers,
this can be implemented via existing NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE and
NL80211_ATTR_IE, but non-mac80211 drivers have a separate command for
this. A driver supports FT if it either is mac80211 or supports this
command.
