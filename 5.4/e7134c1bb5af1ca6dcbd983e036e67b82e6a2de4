x86: KVM: svm: eliminate weird goto from vmrun_interception()

Regardless of whether or not nested_svm_vmrun_msrpm() fails, we return 1
from vmrun_interception() so there's no point in doing goto. Also,
nested_svm_vmrun_msrpm() call can be made from nested_svm_vmrun() where
other nested launch issues are handled.

nested_svm_vmrun() returns a bool, however, its result is ignored in
vmrun_interception() as we always return '1'. As a preparatory change
to putting kvm_skip_emulated_instruction() inside nested_svm_vmrun()
make nested_svm_vmrun() return an int (always '1' for now).
