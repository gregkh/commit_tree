regulator: max77686: fix obtaining "maxim,ena" GPIO

This fixes 96392c3d8ca4, as devm_gpiod_get_from_of_node() does
not do translation "con-id" -> "con-id-gpios" that our bindings expects,
and therefore it was wrong to change connection ID to be simply
"maxim,ena" when moving to using devm_gpiod_get_from_of_node().

Fixes: 96392c3d8ca4 ("regulator: max77686: Pass descriptor instead of GPIO number")
