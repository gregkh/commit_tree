afs: Fix large file support

By default s_maxbytes is set to MAX_NON_LFS, which limits the usable
file size to 2GB, enforced by the vfs.

Commit b9b1f8d5930a ("AFS: write support fixes") added support for the
64-bit fetch and store server operations, but did not change this value.
As a result, attempts to write past the 2G mark result in EFBIG errors:

 $ dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=1 seek=2048
 dd: error writing 'foo': File too large

Set s_maxbytes to MAX_LFS_FILESIZE.
