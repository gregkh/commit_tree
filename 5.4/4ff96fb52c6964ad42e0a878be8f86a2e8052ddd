livepatch: Nullify obj->mod in klp_module_coming()'s error path

klp_module_coming() is called for every module appearing in the system.
It sets obj->mod to a patched module for klp_object obj. Unfortunately
it leaves it set even if an error happens later in the function and the
patched module is not allowed to be loaded.

klp_is_object_loaded() uses obj->mod variable and could currently give a
wrong return value. The bug is probably harmless as of now.
