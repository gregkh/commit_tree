dma-buf: Restore seqlock around dma_resv updates

This reverts
67c97fb79a7f ("dma-buf: add reservation_object_fences helper")
dd7a7d1ff2f1 ("drm/i915: use new reservation_object_fences helper")
0e1d8083bddb ("dma-buf: further relax reservation_object_add_shared_fence")
5d344f58da76 ("dma-buf: nuke reservation_object seq number")

The scenario that defeats simply grabbing a set of shared/exclusive
fences and using them blissfully under RCU is that any of those fences
may be reallocated by a SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU fence slab cache. In this
scenario, while keeping the rcu_read_lock we need to establish that no
fence was changed in the dma_resv after a read (or full) memory barrier.
