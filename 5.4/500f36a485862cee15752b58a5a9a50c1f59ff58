net/mlx5e: Tx, Zero-memset WQE info struct upon update

Not all fields of WQE info are being written in the function,
having some leftovers from previous rounds.
Zero-memset it upon update.

Particularly, not nullifying the wi->resync_dump_frag field
will cause double free of the kTLS DUMPed frags.
