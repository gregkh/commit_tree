s390/kasan: provide uninstrumented __strlen

s390 kasan code uses sclp_early_printk to report initialization
failures. The code doing that should not be instrumented, because kasan
shadow memory has not been set up yet. Even though sclp_early_core.c is
compiled with instrumentation disabled it uses strlen function, which
is instrumented and would produce shadow memory access if used. To
avoid that, introduce uninstrumented __strlen function to be used
instead.

Before commit 7e0d92f00246 ("s390/kasan: improve string/memory functions
checks") few string functions (including strlen) were escaping kasan
instrumentation due to usage of platform specific versions which are
implemented in inline assembly.
