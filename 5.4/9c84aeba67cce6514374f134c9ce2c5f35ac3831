drm/vmwgfx: Kill unneeded legacy security features

At one point, the GPU command verifier and user-space handle manager
couldn't properly protect GPU clients from accessing each other's data.
Instead there was an elaborate mechanism to make sure only the active
master's primary clients could render. The other clients were either
put to sleep or even killed (if the master had exited). VRAM was
evicted on master switch. With the advent of render-node functionality,
we relaxed the VRAM eviction, but the other mechanisms stayed in place.

Now that the GPU  command verifier and ttm object manager properly
isolates primary clients from different master realms we can remove the
master switch related code and drop those legacy features.
