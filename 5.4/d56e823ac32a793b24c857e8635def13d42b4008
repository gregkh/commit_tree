drm/i915: Deal with cpp==8 for g4x watermarks

Docs tell us that on g4x we have to compute the SR watermarks
using 4 bytes per pixel. I'm going to assume that only applies
to 1 and 2 byte per pixel formats, and not 8 byte per pixel
formats. That seems like a recipe for an insufficient watermark
which could lead to underruns. Use the maximum of the two numbers
instead.
