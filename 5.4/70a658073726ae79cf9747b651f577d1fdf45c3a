PCI: Unexport pci_bus_sem

pci_bus_sem is not used by a loadable kernel module and does not need to be
exported.

It was exported by ce29ca3ea407 ("PCI: acpiphp: remove all functions in
slot, even without ACPI _EJx"), which added a use of pci_bus_sem in
acpiphp, which could be built as a module at that time.  But since
6037a803b05e ("PCI: acpiphp: Convert acpiphp to be builtin only, not
modular"), it can no longer be built as a module.
