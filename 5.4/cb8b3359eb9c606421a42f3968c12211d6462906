scsi: ufs: Configure clock in .hce_enable_notify() in Cadence UFS

Configure CDNS_UFS_REG_HCLKDIV in .hce_enable_notify() instead of
.setup_clock() because if UFSHCD resets the controller ip because of phy or
device related errors then CDNS_UFS_REG_HCLKDIV is reset to default value
and .setup_clock() is not called later in the sequence whereas
.hce_enable_notify will be called everytime controller is reenabled.
