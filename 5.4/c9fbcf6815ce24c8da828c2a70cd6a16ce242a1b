crypto: caam/qi - execute library only on DPAA 1.x

In the process of turning caam/qi into a library, the check of
MCFGR[QI] bit has been inadvertently dropped.
Fix the condition for DPAA 1.x QI detection, which should be:
MCFGR[QI] && !MCFGR[DPAA2]

A check in the library exit point is currently not needed,
since the list of registered algorithms is empty.

While here, silence the library initialization abort - since jr.c
calls it unconditionally.
