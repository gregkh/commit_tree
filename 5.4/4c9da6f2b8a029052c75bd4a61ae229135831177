i40e: Fix for ethtool -m issue on X722 NIC

This patch contains fix for a problem with command:
'ethtool -m <dev>'
which breaks functionality of:
'ethtool <dev>'
when called on X722 NIC

Disallowed update of link phy_types on X722 NIC
Currently correct value cannot be obtained from FW
Previously wrong value returned by FW was used and was
a root cause for incorrect output of 'ethtool <dev>' command
