drm: kirin: Add alloc_hw_ctx/clean_hw_ctx ops in driver data

As part of refactoring the kirin driver to better support
different hardware revisions, this patch changes the
alloc/clean_hw_ctx functions to be called via driver_data
specific funciton pointers.

This will allow the ade_drm_init to later be made generic and
moved to kirin_drm_drv.c
