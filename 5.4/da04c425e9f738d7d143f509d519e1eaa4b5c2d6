gpio: aspeed: Update documentation with ast2600 controllers

The ast2600 is a new generation of SoC from ASPEED. Similarly to the
ast2400 and ast2500, it has a GPIO controller for it's 3.3V GPIO pins.
Additionally, it has a GPIO controller for 36 1.8V GPIO pins.  We use
the ngpio property to differentiate between these controllers.
