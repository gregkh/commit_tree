mm: move memcmp_pages() and pages_identical()

Patch series "THP aware uprobe", v13.

This patchset makes uprobe aware of THPs.

Currently, when uprobe is attached to text on THP, the page is split by
FOLL_SPLIT.  As a result, uprobe eliminates the performance benefit of
THP.

This set makes uprobe THP-aware.  Instead of FOLL_SPLIT, we introduces
FOLL_SPLIT_PMD, which only split PMD for uprobe.

After all uprobes within the THP are removed, the PTE-mapped pages are
regrouped as huge PMD.

This set (plus a few THP patches) is also available at

This patch (of 6):

Move memcmp_pages() to mm/util.c and pages_identical() to mm.h, so that we
can use them in other files.
