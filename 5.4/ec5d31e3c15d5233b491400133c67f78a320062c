bnxt_en: Handle firmware reset status during IF_UP.

During IF_UP, newer firmware has a new status flag that indicates that
firmware has reset.  Add new function bnxt_fw_init_one() to re-probe the
firmware and re-setup VF resources on the PF if necessary.  If the
re-probe fails, set a flag to prevent bnxt_open() from proceeding again.
