Input: synaptics-rmi4 - destroy F54 poller workqueue when removing

The driver forgets to destroy workqueue in remove() similarly to what is
done when probe() fails. Add a call to destroy_workqueue() to fix it.

Since unregistration will wait for the work to finish, we do not need to
cancel/flush the work instance in remove().
