libbpf: add .BTF.ext offset relocation section loading

Add support for BPF CO-RE offset relocations. Add section/record
iteration macros for .BTF.ext. These macro are useful for iterating over
each .BTF.ext record, either for dumping out contents or later for BPF
CO-RE relocation handling.

To enable other parts of libbpf to work with .BTF.ext contents, moved
a bunch of type definitions into libbpf_internal.h.
