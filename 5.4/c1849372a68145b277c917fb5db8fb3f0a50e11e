media: saa7134: keep demod i2c gate closed on Medion 7134

Medion 7134 has two i2c eeproms on the same i2c bus sharing the same bus
addresses: the first one for SAA7134 chip config and the second one behind
TDA10046 DVB-T demod chip i2c gate storing its firmware.
The TV tuner on this board is not behind this i2c gate.

Due to the bus conflict described above, the card PCI SVID / SSID sometimes
gets garbled after a reboot, which makes it necessary to specify the card
model manually as an insmod option in order for it to be detected reliably.
To avoid this, let's just leave the gate permanently closed so the eeprom
chips won't clash.

The demod firmware load is done with its i2c gate closed anyway so it is
not affected by this change.
