smb3: fix signing verification of large reads

Code cleanup in the 5.1 kernel changed the array
passed into signing verification on large reads leading
to warning messages being logged when copying files to local
systems from remote.

   SMB signature verification returned error = -5

This changeset fixes verification of SMB3 signatures of large
reads.
