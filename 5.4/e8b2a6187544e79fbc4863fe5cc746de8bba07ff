serial: mctrl_gpio: Avoid probe failures in case of missing gpiolib

If CONFIG_GPIOLIB is not enabled, mctrl_gpio_init() and
mctrl_gpio_init_noauto() will currently return an error pointer with
-ENOSYS. As the mctrl GPIOs are usually optional, drivers need to
check for this condition to allow continue probing.

To avoid the need for this check in each driver, we return NULL
instead, as all the mctrl_gpio_*() functions are skipped anyway.
We also adapt mctrl_gpio_to_gpiod() to be in line with this change.
