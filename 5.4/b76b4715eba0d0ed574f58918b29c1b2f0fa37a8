raid5: don't increment read_errors on EILSEQ return

While MD continues to count read errors returned by the lower layer.
If those errors are -EILSEQ, instead of -EIO, it should NOT increase
the read_errors count.

When RAID6 is set up on dm-integrity target that detects massive
corruption, the leg will be ejected from the array.  Even if the
issue is correctable with a sector re-write and the array has
necessary redundancy to correct it.

The leg is ejected because it runs up the rdev->read_errors beyond
conf->max_nr_stripes.  The return status in dm-drypt when there is
a data integrity error is -EILSEQ (BLK_STS_PROTECTION).
