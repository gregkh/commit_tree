doc/af_xdp: include unaligned chunk case

The addition of unaligned chunks mode, the documentation needs to be
updated to indicate that the incoming addr to the fill ring will only be
masked if the user application is run in the aligned chunk mode. This patch
also adds a line to explicitly indicate that the incoming addr will not be
masked if running the user application in the unaligned chunk mode.
