drm/vgem: Ditch attach trickery in the fence ioctl

It looks like this was done purely to get a consistent place to look
up the reservation object pointer. With the drm_prime.c helper code
now also setting gem_object->resv for imported objects we can just use
that pointer directly, instead of first ensuring a dma-buf exists.

v2: Note that I screwed up the patch ordering, hence why this needed
a Fixes: tag - CI spotted the broken intermediate state.
