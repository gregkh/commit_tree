arm64: mm: fix spurious fault detection

When detecting a spurious EL1 translation fault, we attempt to compare
ESR_EL1.DFSC with PAR_EL1.FST. We erroneously use FIELD_PREP() to
extract PAR_EL1.FST, when we should be using FIELD_GET().

In the wise words of Robin Murphy:

| FIELD_GET() is a UBFX, FIELD_PREP() is a BFI

Using FIELD_PREP() means that that dfsc & ESR_ELx_FSC_TYPE is always
zero, and hence not equal to ESR_ELx_FSC_FAULT. Thus we detect any
unhandled translation fault as spurious.

... so let's use FIELD_GET() to ensure we don't decide all translation
faults are spurious. ESR_EL1.DFSC occupies bits [5:0], and requires no
shifting.
