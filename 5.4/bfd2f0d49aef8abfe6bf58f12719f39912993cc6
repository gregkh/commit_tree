powerpc/powernv: Get rid of old scom_controller abstraction

Once upon a time, the SCOM access code was used by the WSP platform as
well as powernv. Thus it made sense to have a generic SCOM access
interface to abstract between different platforms.

Now that it's just powernv, with no other platforms currently on the
horizon, let's rip out scom_controller and make everything much
simpler and more direct.

While we're here, fix up the comment block at the top.
