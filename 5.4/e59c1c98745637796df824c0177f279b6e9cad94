crypto: aes - create AES library based on the fixed time AES code

Take the existing small footprint and mostly time invariant C code
and turn it into a AES library that can be used for non-performance
critical, casual use of AES, and as a fallback for, e.g., SIMD code
that needs a secondary path that can be taken in contexts where the
SIMD unit is off limits (e.g., in hard interrupts taken from kernel
context)
