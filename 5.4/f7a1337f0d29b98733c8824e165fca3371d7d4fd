can: peak_usb: fix slab info leak

Fix a small slab info leak due to a failure to clear the command buffer
at allocation.

The first 16 bytes of the command buffer are always sent to the device
in pcan_usb_send_cmd() even though only the first two may have been
initialised in case no argument payload is provided (e.g. when waiting
for a response).
