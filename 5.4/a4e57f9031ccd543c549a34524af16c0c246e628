drm/i915: Teach execbuffer to take the engine wakeref not GT

In the next patch, we would like to couple into the engine wakeref to
free the batch pool on idling. The caveat here is that we therefore want
to track the engine wakeref more precisely and to hold it instead of the
broader GT wakeref as we process the ioctl.

v2: Avoid introducing odd semantics for a shortlived timeline->mutex
acquisition interface.
