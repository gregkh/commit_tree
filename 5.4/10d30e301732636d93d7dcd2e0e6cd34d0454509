libbpf: add flags to umem config

This patch adds a 'flags' field to the umem_config and umem_reg structs.
This will allow for more options to be added for configuring umems.

The first use for the flags field is to add a flag for unaligned chunks
mode. These flags can either be user-provided or filled with a default.

Since we change the size of the xsk_umem_config struct, we need to version
the ABI. This patch includes the ABI versioning for xsk_umem__create. The
Makefile was also updated to handle multiple function versions in
check-abi.
