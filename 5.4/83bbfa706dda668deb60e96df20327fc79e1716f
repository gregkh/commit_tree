smb3: add mount option to allow forced caching of read only share

If a share is immutable (at least for the period that it will
be mounted) it would be helpful to not have to revalidate
dentries repeatedly that we know can not be changed remotely.

Add "cache=" option (cache=ro) for mounting read only shares
in order to improve performance in cases in which we know that
the share will not be changing while it is in use.
