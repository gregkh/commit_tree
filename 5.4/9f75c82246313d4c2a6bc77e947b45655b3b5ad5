KEYS: trusted: correctly initialize digests and fix locking issue

Commit 0b6cf6b97b7e ("tpm: pass an array of tpm_extend_digest structures to
tpm_pcr_extend()") modifies tpm_pcr_extend() to accept a digest for each
PCR bank. After modification, tpm_pcr_extend() expects that digests are
passed in the same order as the algorithms set in chip->allocated_banks.

This patch fixes two issues introduced in the last iterations of the patch
set: missing initialization of the TPM algorithm ID in the tpm_digest
structures passed to tpm_pcr_extend() by the trusted key module, and
unreleased locks in the TPM driver due to returning from tpm_pcr_extend()
without calling tpm_put_ops().
