drm/i915/uc: Don't enable communication twice on resume

When coming out of S3/S4 we sanitize and re-init the HW, which includes
enabling communication during uc_init_hw. We therefore don't want to do
that again in uc_resume and can just tell GuC to reload its state.

v2: split uc_resume and uc_runtime_resume to match the suspend
    functions and to better differentiate the expected state in the 2
    scenarios (Chris)
