vfs: Add file timestamp range support

Add fields to the superblock to track the min and max
timestamps supported by filesystems.

Initially, when a superblock is allocated, initialize
it to the max and min values the fields can hold.
Individual filesystems override these to match their
actual limits.

Pseudo filesystems are assumed to always support the
min and max allowable values for the fields.
