KVM: x86: announce KVM_CAP_HYPERV_ENLIGHTENED_VMCS support only when it is available

It was discovered that after commit 65efa61dc0d5 ("selftests: kvm: provide
common function to enable eVMCS") hyperv_cpuid selftest is failing on AMD.
The reason is that the commit changed _vcpu_ioctl() to vcpu_ioctl() in the
test and this one can't fail.

Instead of fixing the test is seems to make more sense to not announce
KVM_CAP_HYPERV_ENLIGHTENED_VMCS support if it is definitely missing
(on svm and in case kvm_intel.nested=0).
