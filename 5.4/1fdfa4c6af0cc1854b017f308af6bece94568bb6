powerpc: improve prom_init_check rule

This slightly improves the prom_init_check rule.

[1] Avoid needless check

Currently, prom_init_check.sh is invoked every time you run 'make'
even if you have changed nothing in prom_init.c. With this commit,
the script is re-run only when prom_init.o is recompiled.

[2] Beautify the build log

Currently, the O= build shows the absolute path to the script:

  CALL    /abs/path/to/source/of/linux/arch/powerpc/kernel/prom_init_check.sh

With this commit, it is always a relative path to the timestamp file:

  PROMCHK arch/powerpc/kernel/prom_init_check
