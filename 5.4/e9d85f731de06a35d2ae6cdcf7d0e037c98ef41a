drm/vkms: Avoid assigning 0 for possible_crtc

When vkms invoke drm_universal_plane_init(), it sets 0 for
possible_crtcs parameter which means that planes can't be attached to
any CRTC. It currently works due to some safeguard in the drm_crtc file;
however, it is possible to identify the problem by trying to append a
second connector. This patch fixes this issue by modifying
vkms_plane_init() to accept an index parameter which makes the code a
little bit more flexible and avoid set zero to possible_crtcs.
