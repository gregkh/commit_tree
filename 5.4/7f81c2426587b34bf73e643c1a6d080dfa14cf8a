clk: Make clk_bulk_get_all() return a valid "id"

The adreno driver expects the "id" field of the returned clk_bulk_data
to be filled in with strings from the clock-names property.

But due to the use of kmalloc_array() in of_clk_bulk_get_all() it
receives a list of bogus pointers instead.

Zero-initialize the "id" field and attempt to populate with strings from
the clock-names property to resolve both these issues.

Fixes: 8e3e791d20d2 ("drm/msm: Use generic bulk clock function")
