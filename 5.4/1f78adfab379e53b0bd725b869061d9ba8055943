f2fs: disallow switching io_bits option during remount

If IO alignment feature is turned on after remount, we didn't
initialize mempool of it, it turns out we will encounter panic
during IO submission due to access NULL mempool pointer.

This feature should be set only at mount time, so simply deny
configuring during remount.
