x86: KVM: clear interrupt shadow on EMULTYPE_SKIP

When doing x86_emulate_instruction(EMULTYPE_SKIP) interrupt shadow has to
be cleared if and only if the skipping is successful.

There are two immediate issues:
- In SVM skip_emulated_instruction() we are not zapping interrupt shadow
  in case kvm_emulate_instruction(EMULTYPE_SKIP) is used to advance RIP
  (!nrpip_save).
- In VMX handle_ept_misconfig() when running as a nested hypervisor we
  (static_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_HYPERVISOR) case) forget to clear interrupt
  shadow.

Note that we intentionally don't handle the case when the skipped
instruction is supposed to prolong the interrupt shadow ("MOV/POP SS") as
skip-emulation of those instructions should not happen under normal
circumstances.
