macb: propagate errors when getting optional clocks

The tx_clk, rx_clk, and tsu_clk are optional. Currently the macb driver
marks clock as not available if it receives an error when trying to get
a clock. This is wrong, because a clock controller might return
-EPROBE_DEFER if a clock is not available, but will eventually become
available.

In these cases, the driver would probe successfully but will never be
able to adjust the clocks, because the clocks were not available during
probe, but became available later.

For example, the clock controller for the ZynqMP is implemented in the
PMU firmware and the clocks are only available after the firmware driver
has been probed.

Use devm_clk_get_optional() in instead of devm_clk_get() to get the
optional clock and propagate all errors to the calling function.
