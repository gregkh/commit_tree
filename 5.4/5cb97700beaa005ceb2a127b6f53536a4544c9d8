crypto: morus - remove generic and x86 implementations

MORUS was not selected as a winner in the CAESAR competition, which
is not surprising since it is considered to be cryptographically
broken [0]. (Note that this is not an implementation defect, but a
flaw in the underlying algorithm). Since it is unlikely to be in use
currently, let's remove it before we're stuck with it.
