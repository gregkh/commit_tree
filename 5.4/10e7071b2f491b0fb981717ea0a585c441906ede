sched: Rework CPU hotplug task selection

The CPU hotplug task selection is the only place where we used
put_prev_task() on a task that is not current. While looking at that,
it occured to me that we can simplify all that by by using a custom
pick loop.

Since we don't need to put current, we can do away with the fake task
too.
