pagewalk: separate function pointers from iterator data

The mm_walk structure currently mixed data and code.  Split out the
operations vectors into a new mm_walk_ops structure, and while we are
changing the API also declare the mm_walk structure inside the
walk_page_range and walk_page_vma functions.

Based on patch from Linus Torvalds.
