Bluetooth: hidp: Fix assumptions on the return value of hidp_send_message

hidp_send_message was changed to return non-zero values on success,
which some other bits did not expect. This caused spurious errors to be
propagated through the stack, breaking some drivers, such as hid-sony
for the Dualshock 4 in Bluetooth mode.

As pointed out by Dan Carpenter, hid-microsoft directly relied on that
assumption as well.
