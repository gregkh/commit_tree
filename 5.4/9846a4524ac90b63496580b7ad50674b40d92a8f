ARM: dts: imx7d: cl-som-imx7: make ethernet work again

Recent changes to the atheros at803x driver caused
ethernet to stop working on this board.
In particular commit 6d4cd041f0af
("net: phy: at803x: disable delay only for RGMII mode")
and commit cd28d1d6e52e
("net: phy: at803x: Disable phy delay for RGMII mode")
fix the AR8031 driver to configure the phy's (RX/TX)
delays as per the 'phy-mode' in the device tree.

This now prevents ethernet from working on this board.

It used to work before those commits, because the
AR8031 comes out of reset with RX delay enabled, and
the at803x driver didn't touch the delay configuration
at all when "rgmii" mode was selected, and because
arch/arm/mach-imx/mach-imx7d.c:ar8031_phy_fixup()
unconditionally enables TX delay.

Since above commits ar8031_phy_fixup() also has no
effect anymore, and the end-result is that all delays
are disabled in the phy, no ethernet.

Update the device tree to restore functionality.
