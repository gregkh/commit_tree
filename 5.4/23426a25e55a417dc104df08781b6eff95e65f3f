net: dsa: Fix load order between DSA drivers and taggers

The DSA core, DSA taggers and DSA drivers all make use of
module_init(). Hence they get initialised at device_initcall() time.
The ordering is non-deterministic. It can be a DSA driver is bound to
a device before the needed tag driver has been initialised, resulting
in the message:

No tagger for this switch

Rather than have this be fatal, return -EPROBE_DEFER so that it is
tried again later once all the needed drivers have been loaded.
