powerpc/memcpy: Add memcpy_mcsafe for pmem

The pmem infrastructure uses memcpy_mcsafe in the pmem layer so as to
convert machine check exceptions into a return value on failure in case
a machine check exception is encountered during the memcpy. The return
value is the number of bytes remaining to be copied.

This patch largely borrows from the copyuser_power7 logic and does not add
the VMX optimizations, largely to keep the patch simple. If needed those
optimizations can be folded in.
