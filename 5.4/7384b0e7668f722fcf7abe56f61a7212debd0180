power: supply: sc27xx: Fix the the accuracy issue of coulomb calculation

The Spreadtrum fuel gauge will multiply by 2 for counting the coulomb
counter to improve the accuracy, which means the value saved in fuel
gauge is: coulomb counter * 2 * 1000ma_adc. Thus fix the conversion
formular to improve the accuracy of calculating the battery capacity.
