recordmcount: Remove unused fd from uwrite() and ulseek()

uwrite() works within the pseudo-mapping and extends it as necessary
without needing the file descriptor (fd) parameter passed to it.
Similarly, ulseek() doesn't need its fd parameter. These parameters
were only added because the functions bear a conceptual resemblance
to write() and lseek(). Worse, they obscure the fact that at the time
uwrite() and ulseek() are called fd_map is not a valid file descriptor.

Remove the unused file descriptor parameters that make it look like
fd_map is still valid.
