gpiolib: Initialize the hardware with a callback

After changing the drivers to use GPIO core to add an IRQ chip
it appears that some of them requires a hardware initialization
before adding the IRQ chip.

Add an optional callback ->init_hw() to allow that drivers
to initialize hardware if needed.

This change is a part of the fix NULL pointer dereference
brought to the several drivers recently.
