KVM: selftests: fix ucall on x86

After commit e8bb4755eea2("KVM: selftests: Split ucall.c into architecture
specific files") selftests which use ucall on x86 started segfaulting and
apparently it's gcc to blame: it "optimizes" ucall() function throwing away
va_start/va_end part because it thinks the structure is not being used.
Previously, it couldn't do that because the there was also MMIO version and
the decision which particular implementation to use was done at runtime.

With older gccs it's possible to solve the problem by adding 'volatile'
to 'struct ucall' but at least with gcc-8.3 this trick doesn't work.

'memory' clobber seems to do the job.
