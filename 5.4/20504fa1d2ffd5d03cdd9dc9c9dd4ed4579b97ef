pinctrl: armada-37xx: fix control of pins 32 and up

The 37xx configuration registers are only 32 bits long, so
pins 32-35 spill over into the next register.  The calculation
for the register address was done, but the bitmask was not, so
any configuration to pin 32 or above resulted in a bitmask that
overflowed and performed no action.

Fix the register / offset calculation to also adjust the offset.
