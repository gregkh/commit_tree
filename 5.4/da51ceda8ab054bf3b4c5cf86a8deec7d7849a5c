soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: Add goto to of_node_put() before return

The local variable np in function rcar_sysc_pd_init takes the return
value of of_find_matching_node_and_match(), which gets a node but does
not put it.  If np is not put before the function returns, it may cause
a memory leak.

Hence, remove the return statement that does not immediately follow a
putting of np.  Replace it with a goto pointing to a pre-existing label
that first puts np and then returns the required value.

Issue found with Coccinelle.
