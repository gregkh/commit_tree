drop_monitor: Require CAP_NET_ADMIN for drop monitor configuration

Currently, the configure command does not do anything but return an
error. Subsequent patches will enable the command to change various
configuration options such as alert mode and packet truncation.

Similar to other netlink-based configuration channels, make sure only
users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability set can execute this command.
