drm/omapdrm: drop fb_debug_enter/leave

This is a no-op on atomic drivers because with atomic it's simply too
complicated to get all the locking and workers and nonblocking
synchronization correct, from essentially an NMI context. Well, too
complicated = impossible. Also, omapdrm never implemented the
mode_set_base_atomic hook, so I kinda wonder why this was ever added.

Drop the hooks.
