ARM: dts: rockchip: Limit WiFi TX power on rk3288-veyron-jerry

The downstream Chrome OS 3.14 kernel for jerry limits WiFi TX power
through calibration data in the device tree [1]. Add a DT node for
the WiFi chip and use the downstream calibration data.

Not all calibration data entries have the length specified in the
binding (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/wireless/marvell-8xxx.txt),
however this is the data used by the downstream ('official') kernel
and the binding mentions that "the length can vary between hw
versions".
