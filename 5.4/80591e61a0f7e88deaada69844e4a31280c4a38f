kbuild: tell sparse about the $ARCH

Sparse uses the same executable for all archs and uses flags
like -m64, -mbig-endian or -D__arm__ for arch-specific parameters.
But Sparse also uses value from the host machine used to build
Sparse as default value for the target machine.

This works, of course, well for native build but can create
problems when cross-compiling, like defining both '__i386__'
and '__arm__' when cross-compiling for arm on a x86-64 machine.

Fix this by explicitely telling sparse the target architecture.
