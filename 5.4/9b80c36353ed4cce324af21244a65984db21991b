selinux: always return a secid from the network caches if we find one

Previously if we couldn't find an entry in the cache and we failed to
allocate memory for a new cache entry we would fail the network object
label lookup; this is obviously not ideal.  This patch fixes this so
that we return the object label even if we can't cache the object at
this point in time due to memory pressure.
