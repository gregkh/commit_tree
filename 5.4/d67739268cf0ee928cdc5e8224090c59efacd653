drm/i915/gt: Mark up the nested engine-pm timeline lock as irqsafe

We use a fake timeline->mutex lock to reassure lockdep that the timeline
is always locked when emitting requests. However, the use inside
__engine_park() may be inside hardirq and so lockdep now complains about
the mixed irq-state of the nested locked. Disable irqs around the
lockdep tracking to keep it happy.
