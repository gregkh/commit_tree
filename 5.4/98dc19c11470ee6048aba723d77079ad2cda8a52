tracing/hwlat: Report total time spent in all NMIs during the sample

nmi_total_ts is supposed to record the total time spent in *all* NMIs
that occur on the given CPU during the (active portion of the)
sampling window. However, the code seems to be overwriting this
variable for each NMI, thereby only recording the time spent in the
most recent NMI. Fix it by accumulating the duration instead.
