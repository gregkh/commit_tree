scsi: hisi_sas: Snapshot HW cache of IOST and ITCT at debugfs

The value of IOST/ITCT is updated to cache first, and then synchronize to
DDR periodically. So the value in IOST/ITCT cache is the latest data and
it's important for debugging.

So, the HW cache of IOST and ITCT should be snapshot at debugfs.
