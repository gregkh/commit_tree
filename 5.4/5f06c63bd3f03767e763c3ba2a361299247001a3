net: dsa: sja1105: Advertise the 8 TX queues

This is a preparation patch for the tc-taprio offload (and potentially
for other future offloads such as tc-mqprio).

Instead of looking directly at skb->priority during xmit, let's get the
netdev queue and the queue-to-traffic-class mapping, and put the
resulting traffic class into the dsa_8021q PCP field. The switch is
configured with a 1-to-1 PCP-to-ingress-queue-to-egress-queue mapping
(see vlan_pmap in sja1105_main.c), so the effect is that we can inject
into a front-panel's egress traffic class through VLAN tagging from
Linux, completely transparently.

Unfortunately the switch doesn't look at the VLAN PCP in the case of
management traffic to/from the CPU (link-local frames at
01-80-C2-xx-xx-xx or 01-1B-19-xx-xx-xx) so we can't alter the
transmission queue of this type of traffic on a frame-by-frame basis. It
is only selected through the "hostprio" setting which ATM is harcoded in
the driver to 7.
