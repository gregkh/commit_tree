media: vb2: reorder checks in vb2_poll()

When reaching the end of stream, V4L2 clients may expect the
V4L2_EOS_EVENT before being able to dequeue the last buffer, which has
the V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST flag set.

If the vb2_poll() function first checks for events and afterwards if
buffers are available, a driver can queue the V4L2_EOS_EVENT event and
return the buffer after the check for events but before the check for
buffers. This causes vb2_poll() to signal that the buffer with
V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST can be read without the V4L2_EOS_EVENT being
available.

First, check for available buffers and afterwards for events to ensure
that if vb2_poll() signals POLLIN | POLLRDNORM for the
V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST buffer, it also signals POLLPRI for the
V4L2_EOS_EVENT.
