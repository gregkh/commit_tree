drm/i915/cmdparser: Use explicit goto for error paths

In the next patch we will be adding a second valid
termination condition which will require a small
amount of refactoring to share logic with the BB_END
case.

Refactor all error conditions to jump to a dedicated
exit path, with 'break' reserved only for a successful
parse.
