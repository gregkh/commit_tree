clk: meson: remove ao input bypass clocks

During probe, bypass clocks (i.e. ao-in-xtal) are made from device-tree
inputs to provide input clocks which can be access through global name.
The cons of this method are the duplicated clocks, means more string
comparison.

Specify parent directly with device-tree clock name.

Function to regiter bypass clocks is removed.

Input parameters from meson aoclk data structure are deprecated and then
deleted since all aoclk files are migrated.
