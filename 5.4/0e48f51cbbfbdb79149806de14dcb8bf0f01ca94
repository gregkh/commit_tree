Revert "libata, freezer: avoid block device removal while system is frozen"

This reverts commit 85fbd722ad0f5d64d1ad15888cd1eb2188bfb557.

The commit was added as a quick band-aid for a hang that happened when a
block device was removed during system suspend. Now that bdi_wq is not
freezable anymore the hang should not be possible and we can get rid of
this hack by reverting it.
