qed: reduce maximum stack frame size

clang warns about an overly large stack frame in one function
when it decides to inline all __qed_get_vport_*() functions into
__qed_get_vport_stats():

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_l2.c:1889:13: error: stack frame size of 1128 bytes in function '_qed_get_vport_stats' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

Use a noinline_for_stack annotation to prevent clang from inlining
these, which keeps the maximum stack usage at around half of that
in the worst case, similar to what we get with gcc.
