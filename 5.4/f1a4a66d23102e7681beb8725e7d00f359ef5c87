ice: fix set pause param autoneg check

When ETHTOOL_GLINKSETTINGS is defined get pause param pause->autoneg
reports SW configured setting, however when not defined get pause param
pause->autoneg reports the link status. Set pause param needs to compare
pause->autoneg with the same source as get pause param to block the user
from changing autoneg with the set pause param option, or the user
may be incorrectly blocked from changing Rx|Tx pause settings.
