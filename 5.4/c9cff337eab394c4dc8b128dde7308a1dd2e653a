ASoC: mchp-i2s-mcc: Fix simultaneous capture and playback in master mode

This controller supports capture and playback running at the same time,
with the limitation that both capture and playback must be configured the
same way (sample rate, sample format, number of channels, etc). For this,
we have to assure that the configuration registers look the same when
capture and playback are initiated.
This patch fixes a bug in which the controller is in master mode and the
hw_params() callback fails for the second audio stream. The fail occurs
because the divisors are calculated after comparing the configuration
registers for capture and playback. The fix consists in calculating the
divisors before comparing the configuration registers. BCLK and LRC are
then configured and started only if the controller is not already running.
