net/mlx5e: Protect encap hash table with mutex

To remove dependency on rtnl lock, protect encap hash table from concurrent
modifications with new "encap_tbl_lock" mutex. Use the mutex to protect
internal encap entry state from concurrent modification. This is necessary
because a flow can be attached to multiple encap entries simultaneously,
which significantly complicates using finer grained per-entry lock.
