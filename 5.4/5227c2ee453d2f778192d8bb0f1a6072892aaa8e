rtw88: 8822c: add SW DPK support

Power amplifiers are not linear components, and require DPK to
reduce its nonlinearity. DPK is called Digital Pre-distortion
Calibration, can be used to compensate the output of power.

DPK tracking is in charge of tracking the thermal changes. And
it then shifts the power curve accordingly, which makes the
power output remains linear even if the PA works in different
temperature.

To perform DPK, the parameter table should also be updated.
And the table will be applied when device is powered on.
Then DPK will reference the values to calibrate.
