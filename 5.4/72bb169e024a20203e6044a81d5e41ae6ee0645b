Bluetooth: mgmt: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct mgmt_rp_get_connections {
	...
        struct mgmt_addr_info addr[0];
} __packed;

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*rp) + (i * sizeof(struct mgmt_addr_info));

with:

struct_size(rp, addr, i)

Also, notice that, in this case, variable rp_len is not necessary,
hence it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
