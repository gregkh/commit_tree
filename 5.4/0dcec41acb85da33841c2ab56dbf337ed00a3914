scsi: qla2xxx: Make sure that aborted commands are freed

The LIO core requires that the target driver callback functions
.queue_data_in() and .queue_status() call target_put_sess_cmd() or
transport_generic_free_cmd(). These calls may happen synchronously or
asynchronously. Make sure that one of these LIO functions is called in case
a command has been aborted. This patch avoids that the code for removing a
session hangs due to commands that do not make progress.
