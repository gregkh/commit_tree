blk-mq: introduce blk_mq_tagset_wait_completed_request()

blk-mq may schedule to call queue's complete function on remote CPU via
IPI, but doesn't provide any way to synchronize the request's complete
fn. The current queue freeze interface can't provide the synchonization
because aborted requests stay at blk-mq queues during EH.

In some driver's EH(such as NVMe), hardware queue's resource may be freed &
re-allocated. If the completed request's complete fn is run finally after the
hardware queue's resource is released, kernel crash will be triggered.

Prepare for fixing this kind of issue by introducing
blk_mq_tagset_wait_completed_request().
