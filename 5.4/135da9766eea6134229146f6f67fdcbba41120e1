btrfs: volumes: Add comment for find_free_dev_extent_start()

Since commit 6df9a95e6339 ("Btrfs: make the chunk allocator completely
tree lockless") we search commit root of device tree to avoid deadlock.

This introduced a safety feature, find_free_dev_extent_start() won't
use dev extents which just get freed in current transaction.

This safety feature makes sure we won't allocate new block group using
just freed dev extents to break CoW.

However, this feature also makes find_free_dev_extent_start() not
reliable reporting free device space.  Just add such comment to make
later viewer careful about this behavior.

This behavior makes one caller, btrfs_can_relocate() unreliable
determining the device free space.
