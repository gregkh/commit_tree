f2fs: Fix indefinite loop in f2fs_gc()

Policy - Foreground GC, LFS and greedy GC mode.

Under this policy, f2fs_gc() loops forever to GC as it doesn't have
enough free segements to proceed and thus it keeps calling gc_more
for the same victim segment.  This can happen if the selected victim
segment could not be GC'd due to failed blkaddr validity check i.e.
is_alive() returns false for the blocks set in current validity map.

Fix this by keeping track of such invalid segments and skip those
segments for selection in get_victim_by_default() to avoid endless
GC loop under such error scenarios. Currently, add this logic under
CONFIG_F2FS_CHECK_FS to be able to root cause the issue in debug
version.
