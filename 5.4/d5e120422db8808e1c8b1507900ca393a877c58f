ASoC: intel: cht_bsw_max98090_ti: Add all Chromebooks that need pmc_plt_clk_0 quirk

Every single baytrail chromebook sets PMC to 0, as can be seeing
below by searching through coreboot source code:
	$ grep -rl "PMC_PLT_CLK\[0\]" .
	./rambi/variants/glimmer/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/clapper/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/swanky/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/enguarde/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/winky/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/kip/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/squawks/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/orco/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/ninja/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/heli/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/sumo/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/banjo/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/candy/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/gnawty/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/rambi/devicetree.cb
	./rambi/variants/quawks/devicetree.cb

Plus, Cyan (only non-baytrail chromebook with max98090) also needs
this patch for audio to work.

Thus, this commit adds all the missing devices to bsw_max98090 quirk
table, implemented by commit a182ecd3809c ("ASoC: intel:
cht_bsw_max98090_ti: Add quirk for boards using pmc_plt_clk_0").
