scsi: ufs: Add history of fatal events

Currently only "interrupt-based" errors have their own history, however
there are some "non-interrupt-based" errors or events which need history
to improve debugging or help know the health status of UFS devices.

Example of fatal errors:

 - Link startup error

 - Suspend error

 - Resume error

Example of abnormal events:

 - Task or request abort

 - Device reset (now equals to Logical Unit Reset)

 - Host reset

This patch tries to track above errors and events by existed UFS error
history mechanism.
