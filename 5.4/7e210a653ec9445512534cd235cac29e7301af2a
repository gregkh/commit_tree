srcu: Avoid srcutorture security-based pointer obfuscation

Because pointer output is now obfuscated, and because what you really
want to know is whether or not the callback lists are empty, this commit
replaces the srcu_data structure's head callback pointer printout with
a single character that is "." is the callback list is empty or "C"
otherwise.

This is the only remaining user of rcu_segcblist_head(), so this
commit also removes this function's definition.  It also turns out that
rcu_segcblist_tail() no longer has any callers, so this commit removes
that function's definition while in the area.  They were both marked
"Interim", and their end has come.
