i2c: iproc: Make bcm_iproc_i2c_quirks constant

Static structure bcm_iproc_i2c_quirks, of type i2c_adapter_quirks, is
only used when being assigned to constant field quirks of a variable
having type i2c_adapter. Hence make bcm_iproc_i2c_quirks constant as
well to prevent it from unintended modification.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
