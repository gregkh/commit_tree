powerpc/mm: refactor ioremap_range() and use ioremap_page_range()

book3s64's ioremap_range() is almost same as fallback ioremap_range(),
except that it calls radix__ioremap_range() when radix is enabled.

radix__ioremap_range() is also very similar to the other ones, expect
that it calls ioremap_page_range when slab is available.

PPC32 __ioremap_caller() have a loop doing the same thing as
ioremap_range() so use it on PPC32 as well.

Lets keep only one version of ioremap_range() which calls
ioremap_page_range() on all platforms when slab is available.

At the same time, drop the nid parameter which is not used.
