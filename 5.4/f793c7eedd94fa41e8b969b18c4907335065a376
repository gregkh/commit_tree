mac80211: minstrel_ht: reduce unnecessary rate probing attempts

On hardware with static fallback tables (e.g. mt76x2), rate probing attempts
can be very expensive.
On such devices, avoid sampling rates slower than the per-group max throughput
rate, based on the assumption that the fallback table will take care of probing
lower rates within that group if the higher rates fail.

To further reduce unnecessary probing attempts, skip duplicate attempts on
rates slower than the max throughput rate.
