net/mlx5e: Extend encap entry with reference counter

List of flows attached to encap entry is used as implicit reference
counter (encap entry is deallocated when list becomes free) and as a
mechanism to obtain encap entry that flow is attached to (through list
head). This is not safe when concurrent modification of list of flows
attached to encap entry is possible. Proper atomic reference counter is
required to support concurrent access.

As a preparation for extending encap with reference counting, extract code
that lookups and deletes encap entry into standalone put/get helpers. In
order to remove this dependency on external locking, extend encap entry
with reference counter to manage its lifetime and extend flow structure
with direct pointer to encap entry that flow is attached to.
