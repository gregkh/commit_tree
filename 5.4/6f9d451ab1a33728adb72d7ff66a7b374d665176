xdp: Add devmap_hash map type for looking up devices by hashed index

A common pattern when using xdp_redirect_map() is to create a device map
where the lookup key is simply ifindex. Because device maps are arrays,
this leaves holes in the map, and the map has to be sized to fit the
largest ifindex, regardless of how many devices actually are actually
needed in the map.

This patch adds a second type of device map where the key is looked up
using a hashmap, instead of being used as an array index. This allows maps
to be densely packed, so they can be smaller.
