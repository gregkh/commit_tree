i2c: hix5hd2: Remove IRQF_ONESHOT

The drivers sets IRQF_ONESHOT and passes only a primary handler. The IRQ
is masked while the primary is handler is invoked independently of
IRQF_ONESHOT.
With IRQF_ONESHOT the core code will not force-thread the interrupt and
this is probably not intended. I *assume* that the original author copied
the IRQ registration from another driver which passed a primary and
secondary handler and removed the secondary handler but keeping the
ONESHOT flag.

Remove IRQF_ONESHOT.
