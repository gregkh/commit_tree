base: soc: Add serial_number attribute to soc

Add new attribute named "serial_number" as a standard interface for
user space to acquire the serial number of the device.

For ST-Ericsson SoCs this is exposed by the cryptically named "soc_id"
attribute, but this provides a human readable standardized name for this
property.
