drm/bridge/synopsys: dsi: Allow VPG to be enabled via debugfs

The Synopsys MIPI DSI IP contains a video test pattern generator which
is helpful in debugging video timing with connected displays.
Add a debugfs directory containing files which allow the VPG to be
enabled and disabled, and its orientation to be changed.
