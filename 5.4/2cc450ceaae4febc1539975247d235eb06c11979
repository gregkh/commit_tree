drm/amd/display: Validate dc_plane_info and dc_plane_size in atomic check

[Why]
Pitch, DCC, rotation and mirroring can result in updates that are not
UPDATE_TYPE_FAST but UPDATE_TYPE_MED instead. DC needs dc_plane_info
and dc_plane_size to make this determination and we aren't currently
passing this into DC during atomic check.

Underflow (visible or non-visible) can occur if we don't validate this
correctly. This also will generally trigger p-state warnings, typically
via the cursor handler when locking.

[How]
Get the framebuffer tiling flags and generate the required structures
for DC in dm_determine_update_type_for_commit.
