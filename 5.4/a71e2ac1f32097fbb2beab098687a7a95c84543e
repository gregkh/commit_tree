i2c: riic: Clear NACK in tend isr

The NACKF flag should be cleared in INTRIICNAKI interrupt processing as
description in HW manual.

This issue shows up quickly when PREEMPT_RT is applied and a device is
probed that is not plugged in (like a touchscreen controller). The result
is endless interrupts that halt system boot.
