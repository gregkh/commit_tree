mm/gup: add make_dirty arg to put_user_pages_dirty_lock()

Subject: mm/gup: add make_dirty arg to put_user_pages_dirty_lock()

Patch series "mm/gup: add make_dirty arg to put_user_pages_dirty_lock()",
v3.

There are about 50+ patches in my tree [2], and I'll be sending out the
remaining ones in a few more groups:

* The block/bio related changes (Jerome mostly wrote those, but I've had
  to move stuff around extensively, and add a little code)

* mm/ changes

* other subsystem patches

* an RFC that shows the current state of the tracking patch set.  That
  can only be applied after all call sites are converted, but it's good to
  get an early look at it.

This is part a tree-wide conversion, as described in fc1d8e7cca2d ("mm:
introduce put_user_page*(), placeholder versions").

This patch (of 3):

Provide more capable variation of put_user_pages_dirty_lock(), and delete
put_user_pages_dirty().  This is based on the following:

1.  Lots of call sites become simpler if a bool is passed into
   put_user_page*(), instead of making the call site choose which
   put_user_page*() variant to call.

2.  Christoph Hellwig's observation that set_page_dirty_lock() is
   usually correct, and set_page_dirty() is usually a bug, or at least
   questionable, within a put_user_page*() calling chain.

This leads to the following API choices:

    * put_user_pages_dirty_lock(page, npages, make_dirty)

    * There is no put_user_pages_dirty(). You have to
      hand code that, in the rare case that it's
      required.
