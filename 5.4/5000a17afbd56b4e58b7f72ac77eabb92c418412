powerpc/fadump: process architected register state data provided by firmware

Firmware provides architected register state data at the time of crash.
Process this data and build CPU notes to append to ELF core. In case
this data is missing or in unsupported format, at least append crashing
CPU's register data, to have something to work with in the vmcore file.
