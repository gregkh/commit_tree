net/mlx5: DR, Limit STE hash table enlarge based on bytemask

When an ste hash table has too many collision we enlarge it
to a bigger hash table (rehash). Rehashing collision improvement
depends on the bytemask value. The more 1 bits we have in bytemask
means better spreading in the table.

Without this fix tables can grow in size without providing any
improvement which can lead to memory depletion and failures.

This patch will limit table rehash to reduce memory and improve
the performance.
