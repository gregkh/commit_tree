net: phy: smsc: LAN8740: add PHY_RST_AFTER_CLK_EN flag

The LAN8740, like the 8720, also requires a reset after enabling clock.
The datasheet [1] 3.8.5.1 says:
	"During a Hardware reset, an external clock must be supplied
	to the XTAL1/CLKIN signal."

I have observed this issue on a custom i.MX6 based board with
the LAN8740A.
