kbuild: remove ar-option and KBUILD_ARFLAGS

Commit 40df759e2b9e ("kbuild: Fix build with binutils <= 2.19")
introduced ar-option and KBUILD_ARFLAGS to deal with old binutils.

According to Documentation/process/changes.rst, the current minimal
supported version of binutils is 2.21 so you can assume the 'D' option
is always supported. Not only GNU ar but also llvm-ar supports it.

With the 'D' option hard-coded, there is no more user of ar-option
or KBUILD_ARFLAGS.
