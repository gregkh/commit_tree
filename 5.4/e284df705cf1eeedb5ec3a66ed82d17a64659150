sched/topology: Allow sched_asym_cpucapacity to be disabled

While the static key is correctly initialized as being disabled, it will
remain forever enabled once turned on. This means that if we start with an
asymmetric system and hotplug out enough CPUs to end up with an SMP system,
the static key will remain set - which is obviously wrong. We should detect
this and turn off things like misfit migration and capacity aware wakeups.

As Quentin pointed out, having separate root domains makes this slightly
trickier. We could have exclusive cpusets that create an SMP island - IOW,
the domains within this root domain will not see any asymmetry. This means
we can't just disable the key on domain destruction, we need to count how
many asymmetric root domains we have.

Consider the following example using Juno r0 which is 2+4 big.LITTLE, where
two identical cpusets are created: they both span both big and LITTLE CPUs:

    asym0    asym1
  [       ][       ]
   L  L  B  L  L  B

  $ cgcreate -g cpuset:asym0
  $ cgset -r cpuset.cpus=0,1,3 asym0
  $ cgset -r cpuset.mems=0 asym0
  $ cgset -r cpuset.cpu_exclusive=1 asym0

  $ cgcreate -g cpuset:asym1
  $ cgset -r cpuset.cpus=2,4,5 asym1
  $ cgset -r cpuset.mems=0 asym1
  $ cgset -r cpuset.cpu_exclusive=1 asym1

  $ cgset -r cpuset.sched_load_balance=0 .

(the CPU numbering may look odd because on the Juno LITTLEs are CPUs 0,3-5
and bigs are CPUs 1-2)

If we make one of those SMP (IOW remove asymmetry) by e.g. hotplugging its
big core, we would end up with an SMP cpuset and an asymmetric cpuset - the
static key must remain set, because we still have one asymmetric root domain.

With the above example, this could be done with:

  $ echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/online

Which would result in:

    asym0   asym1
  [       ][    ]
   L  L  B  L  L

When both SMP and asymmetric cpusets are present, all CPUs will observe
sched_asym_cpucapacity being set (it is system-wide), but not all CPUs
observe asymmetry in their sched domain hierarchy:

  per_cpu(sd_asym_cpucapacity, <any CPU in asym0>) == <some SD at DIE level>
  per_cpu(sd_asym_cpucapacity, <any CPU in asym1>) == NULL

Change the simple key enablement to an increment, and decrement the key
counter when destroying domains that cover asymmetric CPUs.
