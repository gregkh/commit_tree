hrtimer: Improve comments on handling priority inversion against softirq kthread

The handling of a priority inversion between timer cancelling and a a not
well defined possible preemption of softirq kthread is not very clear.

Especially in the posix timers side it's unclear why there is a specific RT
wait callback.

All the nice explanations can be found in the initial changelog of
f61eff83cec9 (hrtimer: Prepare support for PREEMPT_RT").

Extract the detailed informations from there and put it into comments.
