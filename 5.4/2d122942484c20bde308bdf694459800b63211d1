Revert "init/Kconfig: Fix infinite Kconfig recursion on PPC"

This reverts commit 71c67a31f09fa8fdd1495dffd96a5f0d4cef2ede.

Commit 117acf5c29dd ("powerpc/Makefile: Always pass --synthetic to nm if
supported") removed the only conditional definition of $(NM), so we can
revert our temporary bodge to avoid Kconfig recursion and go back to
passing $(NM) through to the 'tools-support-relr.sh' when detecting
support for RELR relocations.
