ima: Add modsig appraise_type option for module-style appended signatures

Introduce the modsig keyword to the IMA policy syntax to specify that
a given hook should expect the file to have the IMA signature appended
to it. Here is how it can be used in a rule:

appraise func=KEXEC_KERNEL_CHECK appraise_type=imasig|modsig

With this rule, IMA will accept either a signature stored in the extended
attribute or an appended signature.

For now, the rule above will behave exactly the same as if
appraise_type=imasig was specified. The actual modsig implementation
will be introduced separately.
