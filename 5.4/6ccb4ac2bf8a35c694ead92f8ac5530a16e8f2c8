powerpc/xive: Fix bogus error code returned by OPAL

There's a bug in skiboot that causes the OPAL_XIVE_ALLOCATE_IRQ call
to return the 32-bit value 0xffffffff when OPAL has run out of IRQs.
Unfortunatelty, OPAL return values are signed 64-bit entities and
errors are supposed to be negative. If that happens, the linux code
confusingly treats 0xffffffff as a valid IRQ number and panics at some
point.

A fix was recently merged in skiboot:

e97391ae2bb5 ("xive: fix return value of opal_xive_allocate_irq()")

but we need a workaround anyway to support older skiboots already
in the field.

Internally convert 0xffffffff to OPAL_RESOURCE which is the usual error
returned upon resource exhaustion.
