drm/i915: Fix various tracepoints for gen2

Gen2 doesn't have a frame counter and apparently we no longer provide
a fake .get_vblank_counter() hook for it. That means all tracepoints
calling that hook will oops. Update the tracepoints to use
intel_crtc_get_vblank_counter() which will gracefully fall back to
using the software counter. This is actually a better approach since
we now get (hopefully accurate) frame numbers in the traces.

This also gets rid of the raw driver->get_vblank_counter() calls, which
we need to do in order to switch to the per-crtc vblank vfuncs.

v2: Deal with new tracepoints
v3: Use a distinct variable name for the internal crtc iterator (Chris)
