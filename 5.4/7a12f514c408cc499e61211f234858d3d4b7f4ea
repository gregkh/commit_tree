tools headers kvm: Sync kvm headers with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  bf653b78f960 ("KVM: vmx: Introduce handle_unexpected_vmexit and handle WAITPKG vmexit")

That trigger these changes in tooling:

    CC       /tmp/build/perf/arch/x86/util/kvm-stat.o
    INSTALL  GTK UI
    DESCEND  plugins
  make[3]: Nothing to be done for '/tmp/build/perf/plugins/libtraceevent-dynamic-list'.
    INSTALL  trace_plugins
    LD       /tmp/build/perf/arch/x86/util/perf-in.o
    LD       /tmp/build/perf/arch/x86/perf-in.o
    LD       /tmp/build/perf/arch/perf-in.o
    LD       /tmp/build/perf/perf-in.o
    LINK     /tmp/build/perf/perf

And this is not just because that header is included, kvm-stat.c
uses the VMX_EXIT_REASONS define and it got changed by the above cset.

And addresses this perf build warnings:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h
