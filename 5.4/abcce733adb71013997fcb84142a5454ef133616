samples/bpf: xdp_fwd explain bpf_fib_lookup return codes

Make it clear that this XDP program depend on the network
stack to do the ARP resolution.  This is connected with the
BPF_FIB_LKUP_RET_NO_NEIGH return code from bpf_fib_lookup().

Another common mistake (seen via XDP-tutorial) is that users
don't realize that sysctl net.ipv{4,6}.conf.all.forwarding
setting is honored by bpf_fib_lookup.
