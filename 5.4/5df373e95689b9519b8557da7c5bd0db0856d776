mm/page_io.c: do not free shared swap slots

The following race is observed due to which a processes faulting on a
swap entry, finds the page neither in swapcache nor swap.  This causes
zram to give a zero filled page that gets mapped to the process,
resulting in a user space crash later.

Consider parent and child processes Pa and Pb sharing the same swap slot
with swap_count 2.  Swap is on zram with SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO set.
Virtual address 'VA' of Pa and Pb points to the shared swap entry.

Pa                                       Pb

fault on VA                              fault on VA
do_swap_page                             do_swap_page
lookup_swap_cache fails                  lookup_swap_cache fails
                                         Pb scheduled out
swapin_readahead (deletes zram entry)
swap_free (makes swap_count 1)
                                         Pb scheduled in
                                         swap_readpage (swap_count == 1)
                                         Takes SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO path
                                         zram enrty absent
                                         zram gives a zero filled page

Fix this by making sure that swap slot is freed only when swap count
drops down to one.
