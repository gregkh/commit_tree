firmware: arm_scmi: Drop config flag in clk_ops->rate_set

CLOCK_PROTOCOL_ATTRIBUTES provides attributes to indicate the maximum
number of pending asynchronous clock rate changes supported by the
platform. If it's non-zero, then we should be able to use asynchronous
clock rate set for any clocks until the maximum limit is reached.

In order to add that support, let's drop the config flag passed to
clk_ops->rate_set and handle the asynchronous requests dynamically.
