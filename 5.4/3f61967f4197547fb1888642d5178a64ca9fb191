mlxsw: spectrum: Prevent auto negotiation on number of lanes

After 50G-1-lane and 100G-2-lanes link modes were introduced, the driver

speed and type, but also on number of lanes.

Prevent auto negotiation on number of lanes by allowing only port speeds
that can be supported on a given port according to its width.
