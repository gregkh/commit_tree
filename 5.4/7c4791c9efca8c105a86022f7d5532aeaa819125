arm64: Kconfig: Make CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO a proper Kconfig option

CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO is defined by passing '-DCONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO' to the
compiler when the generic compat vDSO code is in use. It's much cleaner
and simpler to expose this as a proper Kconfig option (like x86 does),
so do that and remove the bodge.
