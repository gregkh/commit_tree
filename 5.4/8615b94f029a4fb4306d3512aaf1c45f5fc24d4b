ubi: ubi_wl_get_peb: Increase the number of attempts while getting PEB

Running stress test io_paral (A pressure ubi test in mtd-utils) on an
UBI device with fewer PEBs (fastmap enabled) may cause ENOSPC errors and
make UBI device read-only, but there are still free PEBs on the UBI
device. This problem can be easily reproduced by performing the following
steps on a 2-core machine:
  $ modprobe nandsim first_id_byte=0x20 second_id_byte=0x33 parts=80
  $ modprobe ubi mtd="0,0" fm_autoconvert
  $ ./io_paral /dev/ubi0

We may see the following verbose:
(output)
  [io_paral] update_volume():108: failed to write 380 bytes at offset
  95920 of volume 2
  [io_paral] update_volume():109: update: 97088 bytes
  [io_paral] write_thread():227: function pwrite() failed with error 28
  (No space left on device)
  [io_paral] write_thread():229: cannot write 15872 bytes to offs 31744,

In function ubi_wl_get_peb, the operation of filling the pool
(ubi_update_fastmap) with free PEBs and fetching a free PEB from the pool
is not atomic. After thread A filling the pool with free PEB, free PEB may
be taken away by thread B. When thread A checks the expression again, the
condition is still unsatisfactory. At this time, there may still be free
PEBs on UBI that can be filled into the pool.

This patch increases the number of attempts to obtain PEB. An extreme
case (No free PEBs left after creating test volumes) has been tested on
different type of machines for 100 times. The biggest number of attempts
are shown below:

             x86_64     arm64
  2-core        4         4
  4-core        8         4
  8-core        4         4
