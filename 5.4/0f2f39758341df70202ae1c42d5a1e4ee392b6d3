drm/i915: Add gen9 BCS cmdparsing

For gen9 we enable cmdparsing on the BCS ring, specifically
to catch inadvertent accesses to sensitive registers

Unlike gen7/hsw, we use the parser only to block certain
registers. We can rely on h/w to block restricted commands,
so the command tables only provide enough info to allow the
parser to delineate each command, and identify commands that
access registers.

Note: This patch deliberately ignores checkpatch issues in
favour of matching the style of the surrounding code. We'll
correct the entire file in one go in a later patch.

v3: rebase (Mika)
v4: Add RING_TIMESTAMP registers to whitelist (Jon)
