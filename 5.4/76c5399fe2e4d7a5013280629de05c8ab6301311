drm/i915/selftests: Careful not to flush hang_fini on error setups

Smatch spotted that we test at the start of hang_fini for a valid (h->gt
is only set after a request is created) but then used it regardless
later on.

v2: Alternatively, we do not need to check as we now always prime h->gt
in hang_init()
