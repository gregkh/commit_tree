net: stmmac: selftest: avoid large stack usage

Putting a struct stmmac_rss object on the stack is a bad idea,
as it exceeds the warning limit for a stack frame on 32-bit architectures:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_selftests.c:1221:12: error: stack frame size of 1208 bytes in function '__stmmac_test_l3filt' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_selftests.c:1338:12: error: stack frame size of 1208 bytes in function '__stmmac_test_l4filt' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

As the object is the trivial empty case, change the called function
to accept a NULL pointer to mean the same thing and remove the
large variable in the two callers.
