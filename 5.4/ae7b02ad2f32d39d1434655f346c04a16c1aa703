iio: common: cros_ec_sensors: Expose cros_ec_sensors frequency range via iio sysfs

Embedded controller return minimum and maximum frequencies, unfortunately
we have no way to know the step for all available frequencies.
Even if not complete, we can return a list of known values using the
standard read_avail callback (IIO_CHAN_INFO_SAMP_FREQ) to provide them to
userland.

Now cros_ec_* sensors provides frequencies values in sysfs like this:
"0 min max". 0 is always true to disable the sensor.

Default frequencies are provided for earlier protocol.
