io_uring: correctly handle non ->{read,write}_iter() file_operations

Currently we just -EINVAL a read or write to an fd that isn't backed
by ->read_iter() or ->write_iter(). But we can handle them just fine,
as long as we punt fo async context first.

Implement a simple loop function for doing ->read() or ->write()
instead, and ensure we call it appropriately.
