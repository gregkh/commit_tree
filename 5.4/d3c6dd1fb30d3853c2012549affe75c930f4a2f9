dma-buf/sw_sync: Synchronize signal vs syncpt free

During release of the syncpt, we remove it from the list of syncpt and
the tree, but only if it is not already been removed. However, during
signaling, we first remove the syncpt from the list. So, if we
concurrently free and signal the syncpt, the free may decide that it is
not part of the tree and immediately free itself -- meanwhile the
signaler goes on to use the now freed datastructure.

In particular, we get struck by commit 0e2f733addbf ("dma-buf: make
dma_fence structure a bit smaller v2") as the cb_list is immediately
clobbered by the kfree_rcu.

v2: Avoid calling into timeline_fence_release() from under the spinlock
