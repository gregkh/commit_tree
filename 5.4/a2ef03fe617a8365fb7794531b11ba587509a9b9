ALSA: hda - Add a quirk model for fixing Huawei Matebook X right speaker

[ This is rather a revival of the patch Tomas sent in months ago, but
  applying only with the quirk model option -- tiwai ]

Hard coded coefficients to make Huawuei Matebook X right speaker
work. The Matebook X has a ALC298, please refer to bug 197801 on
how these numbers were reverse engineered from the Windows driver

The reversed engineered sequence represents a repeating pattern
of verbs, and the only values that are changing periodically are
written on indexes 0x23 and 0x25:

0x500, 0x23
0x400, VALUE1
0x500, 0x25
0x400, VALUE2

* skipped reading sequences (0x500 - 0xc00 sequences are ignored)
* static values from reverse engineering are used

NOTE: since a significant risk is still considered, this is provided
as an experimental fix that isn't applied as default for now.  For
enabling the fix, you'll have to choose huawei-mbx-stereo via model
option of snd-hda-intel module.

If we get feedback from users that this works stably, we may apply it
per default.
