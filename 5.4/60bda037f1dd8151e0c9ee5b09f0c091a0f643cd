posix-cpu-timers: Utilize timerqueue for storage

Using a linear O(N) search for timer insertion affects execution time and
D-cache footprint badly with a larger number of timers.

Switch the storage to a timerqueue which is already used for hrtimers and
alarmtimers. It does not affect the size of struct k_itimer as it.alarm is
still larger.

The extra list head for the expiry list will go away later once the expiry
is moved into task work context.
