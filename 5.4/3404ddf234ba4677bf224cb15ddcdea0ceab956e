selftests/bpf: fix "ctx:write sysctl:write read ok" on s390

"ctx:write sysctl:write read ok" fails on s390 because it reads the
first byte of an int assuming it's the least-significant one, which
is not the case on big-endian arches. Since we are not testing narrow
accesses here (there is e.g. "ctx:file_pos sysctl:read read ok narrow"
for that), simply read the whole int.
