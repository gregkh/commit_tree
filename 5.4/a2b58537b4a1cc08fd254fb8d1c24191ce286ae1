clocksource/drivers/npcm: Fix GENMASK and timer operation

NPCM7XX_Tx_OPER GENMASK bits are wrong, fix them.

Hopefully the NPCM7XX_REG_TICR0 register reset value of those bits was 0,
so it did not cause an issue.

The function npcm7xx_timer_oneshot() reads the register
NPCM7XX_REG_TCSR0, modifies it and then reads it again overwriting the
previous changes. Remove the extra read which is pointless.

The function npcm7xx_timer_periodic() is correct but the code writes
to the NPCM7XX_REG_TICR0 register while it is dealing with the
NPCM7XX_REG_TCSR0 register, that is confusing. Separate the write to
the registers in the code for the sake of clarity.
