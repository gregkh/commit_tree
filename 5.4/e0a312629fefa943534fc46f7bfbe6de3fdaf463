ipv4: Fix table id reference in fib_sync_down_addr

Hendrik reported routes in the main table using source address are not
removed when the address is removed. The problem is that fib_sync_down_addr
does not account for devices in the default VRF which are associated
with the main table. Fix by updating the table id reference.

Fixes: 5a56a0b3a45d ("net: Don't delete routes in different VRFs")
