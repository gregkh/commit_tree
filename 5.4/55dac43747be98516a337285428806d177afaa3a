pinctrl: intel: mark intel_pin_to_gpio __maybe_unused

The intel_pin_to_gpio() function is only called by the
PM support functions and causes a warning when those are disabled:

drivers/pinctrl/intel/pinctrl-intel.c:841:12: error: unused function 'intel_pin_to_gpio' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]

Mark it __maybe_unused to suppress the warning.
