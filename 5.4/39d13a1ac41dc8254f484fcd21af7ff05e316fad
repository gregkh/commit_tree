dm crypt: reuse eboiv skcipher for IV generation

Instead of instantiating a separate cipher to perform the encryption
needed to produce the IV, reuse the skcipher used for the block data
and invoke it one additional time for each block to encrypt a zero
vector and use the output as the IV.

For CBC mode, this is equivalent to using the bare block cipher, but
without the risk of ending up with a non-time invariant implementation
of AES when the skcipher itself is time variant (e.g., arm64 without
Crypto Extensions has a NEON based time invariant implementation of
cbc(aes) but no time invariant implementation of the core cipher other
than aes-ti, which is not enabled by default).

This approach is a compromise between dm-crypt API flexibility and
reducing dependence on parts of the crypto API that should not usually
be exposed to other subsystems, such as the bare cipher API.
