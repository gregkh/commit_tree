libperf: Add PERF_RECORD_KSYMBOL 'struct ksymbol_event' to perf/event.h

Move the PERF_RECORD_KSYMBOL event definition into libperf's event.h
header include.

In order to keep libperf simple, we switch 'u64/u32/u16/u8' types used
events to their generic '__u*' versions.

Perf added 'u*' types mainly to ease up printing __u64 values
as stated in the linux/types.h comment:

  /*
   * We define u64 as uint64_t for every architecture
   * so that we can print it with "%"PRIx64 without getting warnings.
   *
   * typedef __u64 u64;
   * typedef __s64 s64;
   */

Add and use new PRI_lu64 and PRI_lx64 macros for that.  Use extra '_' to
ease up the reading and differentiate them from standard PRI*64 macros.
