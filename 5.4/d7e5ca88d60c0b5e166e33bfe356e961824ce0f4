RDMA/hns: Modify pi vlaue when cq overflows

When exiting "for loop", the actual value of pi will be
increased by 1, which is compatible with the next calculation.
But when pi is equal to "ci + hr_cq-> ib_cq.cqe", the "break"
was called and the pi is actual value, it will lead one cqe
still existing, so the "==" should be modify to ">".
