video: fbdev/mmp/core: Use struct_size() in kzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct mmp_path {
	...
        struct mmp_overlay overlays[0];
};

size = sizeof(struct mmp_path) + count * sizeof(struct mmp_overlay);
instance = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL)

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = kzalloc(struct_size(instance, overlays, count), GFP_KERNEL)

Notice that, in this case, variable size is not necessary, hence it
is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
