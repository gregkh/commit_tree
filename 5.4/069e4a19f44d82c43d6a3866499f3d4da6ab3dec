dmaengine: ti: unexport filter functions

The two filter functions are now marked static, but still exported,
which triggers a coming build-time check:

WARNING: "omap_dma_filter_fn" [vmlinux] is a static EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
WARNING: "edma_filter_fn" [vmlinux] is a static EXPORT_SYMBOL

Remove the unneeded exports as well, as originally intended.

Fixes: 9c71b9eb3cb2 ("dmaengine: omap-dma: make omap_dma_filter_fn private")
Fixes: d2bfe7b5d182 ("dmaengine: edma: make edma_filter_fn private")
