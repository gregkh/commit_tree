drm/i915: Propagate "_release" function name suffix down

Replace mixed "_fini"/"_cleanup"/"_cleanup_hw" suffixes found in names
of functions called from i915_driver_release() with "_release" suffix
consistently.  This provides better code readability, especially
helpful when trying to work out which phase the code is in.

Functions names starting with "i915_driver_", i.e., those defined in
drivers/gpu/dri/i915/i915_drv.c, just have their "cleanup" or "fini"
parts of their names replaced with the "_release" suffix, while names
of functions coming from other source files have been suffixed with
"_driver_release" to avoid ambiguity with other possible .release entry
points.

v2: early_probe pairs better with late_release (Chris)
v3: fix typo in commit message (Joonas)
