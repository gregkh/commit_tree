ice: Remove unnecessary flag ICE_FLAG_MSIX_ENA

This flag is not needed and is called every time we re-enable interrupts
in the hotpath so remove it. Also remove ice_vsi_req_irq() because it
was a wrapper function for ice_vsi_req_irq_msix() whose sole purpose was
checking the ICE_FLAG_MSIX_ENA flag.
