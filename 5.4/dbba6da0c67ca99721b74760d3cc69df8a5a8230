net: hns3: Add support for using order 1 pages with a 4K buffer

Hardware supports 0.5K, 1K, 2K, 4K RX buffer size, the
RX buffer can not be reused because the hns3_page_order
return 0 when page size and RX buffer size are both 4096.

So this patch changes the hns3_page_order to return 1 when
RX buffer is greater than half of the page size and page size
is less the 8192, and dev_alloc_pages has already been used
to allocate the compound page for RX buffer.

This patch also changes hnae3_* to hns3_* for page order
and RX buffer size calculation because they are used in
hns3 module.
