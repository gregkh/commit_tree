um: time-travel: Restrict time update in IRQ handler

We currently do the time updates in the timer handler, even if
we just call the timer handler ourselves. In basic mode we must
in fact do it there since otherwise the OS timer signal won't
move time forward, but in inf-cpu mode we don't need to, and
it's harder to understand.

Restrict the update there to basic mode, adding a comment, and
do it before calling the timer_handler() in inf-cpu mode.
