iommu/io-pgtable: Replace ->tlb_add_flush() with ->tlb_add_page()

The ->tlb_add_flush() callback in the io-pgtable API now looks a bit
silly:

  - It takes a size and a granule, which are always the same
  - It takes a 'bool leaf', which is always true
  - It only ever flushes a single page

With that in mind, replace it with an optional ->tlb_add_page() callback
that drops the useless parameters.
