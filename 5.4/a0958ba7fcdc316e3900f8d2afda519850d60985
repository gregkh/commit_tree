block: Improve default elevator selection

For block devices that do not specify required features, preserve the
current default elevator selection (mq-deadline for single queue
devices, none for multi-queue devices). However, for devices specifying
required features (e.g. zoned block devices ELEVATOR_F_ZBD_SEQ_WRITE
feature), select the first available elevator providing the required
features.

In all cases, default to "none" if no elevator is available or if the
initialization of the default elevator fails.
