interconnect: Add support for path tags

Consumers may have use cases with different bandwidth requirements based
on the system or driver state. The consumer driver can append a specific
tag to the path and pass this information to the interconnect platform
driver to do the aggregation based on this state.

Introduce icc_set_tag() function that will allow the consumers to append
an optional tag to each path. The aggregation of these tagged paths is
platform specific.
