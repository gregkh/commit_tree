xfs: fix maxicount division by zero error

In xfs_ialloc_setup_geometry, it's possible for a malicious/corrupt fs
image to set an unreasonably large value for sb_inopblog which will
cause ialloc_blks to be zero.  If sb_imax_pct is also set, this results
in a division by zero error in the second do_div call.  Therefore, force
maxicount to zero if ialloc_blks is zero.

Note that the kernel metadata verifiers will catch the garbage inopblog
value and abort the fs mount long before it tries to set up the inode
geometry; this is needed to avoid a crash in xfs_db while setting up the
xfs_mount structure.

Found by fuzzing sb_inopblog to 122 in xfs/350.
