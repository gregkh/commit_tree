ALSA: hda/realtek - PCI quirk for Medion E4254

The laptop has a combined jack to attach headsets on the right.
The BIOS encodes them as two different colored jacks at the front,
but otherwise it seems to be configured ok. But any adaption of
the pins config on its own doesn't fix the jack detection to work
in Linux. Still Windows works correct.

This is somehow fixed by chaining ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_HEADSET_MODE,
which seems to register the microphone jack as a headset part and
also results in fixing jack sensing, visible in dmesg as:

-snd_hda_codec_realtek hdaudioC0D0:      Mic=0x19
+snd_hda_codec_realtek hdaudioC0D0:      Headset Mic=0x19

[ Actually the essential change is the location of the jack; the
  driver created "Front Mic Jack" without the matching volume / mute
  control element due to its jack location, which confused PA.
