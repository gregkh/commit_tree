drm/i915/guc: init submission structures as part of guc_init

guc->stage_desc_pool is required as part of the init parameters and
there is no reason we have to init them after HuC. This fixes a NULL
ptr dereference due to guc->stage_desc_pool not being set (no fixes
tag since GuC submission can't be enabled yet).
