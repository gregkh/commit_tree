net: phy: bcm7xxx: define soft_reset for 40nm EPHY

The internal 40nm EPHYs use a "Workaround for putting the PHY in
IDDQ mode." These PHYs require a soft reset to restore functionality
after they are powered back up.

This commit defines the soft_reset function to use genphy_soft_reset
during phy_init_hw to accommodate this.
