tools: bpftool: fix reading from /proc/config.gz

/proc/config has never existed as far as I can see, but /proc/config.gz
is present on Arch Linux. Add support for decompressing config.gz using
zlib which is a mandatory dependency of libelf anyway. Replace existing
stdio functions with gzFile operations since the latter transparently
handles uncompressed and gzip-compressed files.
