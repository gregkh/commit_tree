arm64/ARM: configs: Change CONFIG_REMOTEPROC from m to y

Commit 6334150e9a36 ("remoteproc: don't allow modular build")
changes CONFIG_REMOTEPROC to a boolean from a tristate config
option which inhibits all defconfigs marking CONFIG_REMOTEPROC as
a module in compiling the remoteproc and dependent config options.

So fix the configs to have CONFIG_REMOTEPROC built in.
