drm/i915/uc: Unify uC FW selection

Instead of having 2 identical functions for GuC and HuC firmware
selection, we can unify the selection logic and just use different lists
based on FW type.

Note that the revid is not relevant for current blobs, but the upcoming
CML will be identified as CFL rev 5, so by considering the revid we're
ready for that.

v2: rework blob list defs (Michal), add order check (Chris), fuse GuC
    and HuC lists into one.

v3: remove difference between no uC HW and no uC FW, simplify related
    selection code, check the whole fw list (Michal)
