usb: dwc3: pci: prevent memory leak in dwc3_pci_probe

In dwc3_pci_probe a call to platform_device_alloc allocates a device
which is correctly put in case of error except one case: when the call to
platform_device_add_properties fails it directly returns instead of
going to error handling. This commit replaces return with the goto.
