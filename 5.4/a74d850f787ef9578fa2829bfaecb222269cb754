crypto: inside-secure - fix EINVAL error (buf overflow) for AEAD decrypt

This patch fixes a buffer overflow error returning -EINVAL for AEAD
decrypt operations by NOT appending the (already verified) ICV to
the output packet (which is not expected by the API anyway).
With this fix, all testmgr AEAD (extra) tests now pass.
