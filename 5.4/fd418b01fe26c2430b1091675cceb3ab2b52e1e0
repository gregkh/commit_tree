selftests/bpf: Set rp_filter in test_flow_dissector

Many distributions enable rp_filter. However, the flow dissector test
generates packets that have 1.1.1.1 set as (inner) source address without
this address being reachable. This causes the selftest to fail.

The selftests should not assume a particular initial configuration. Switch
off rp_filter.
