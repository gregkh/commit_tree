net/mlx5: Fix flow counter list auto bits struct

The union should contain the extended dest and counter list.
Remove the resevered 0x40 bits which is redundant.
This change doesn't break any functionally.
Everything works today because the code in fs_cmd.c is using
the correct structs if extended dest or the basic dest.
