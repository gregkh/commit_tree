staging: rtl8188eu: Replace function rtl88eu_phy_rf_config()

Remove function rtl88eu_phy_rf_config as all it does is call
rtl88e_phy_rf6052_config.
Rename rtl88e_phy_rf6052_config to rtl88eu_phy_rf_config and change its
type from static to non-static to maintain compatibility with call
sites.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
