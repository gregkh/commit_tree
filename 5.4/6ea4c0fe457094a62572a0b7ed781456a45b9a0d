soc/fsl/qbman: Update device tree with reserved memory

When using the reserved memory node in the device tree there are
two options - dynamic or static. If a dynamic allocation was
selected (where the kernel selects the address for the allocation)
convert it to a static allocation by inserting the reg property.
This will ensure the same memory is reused after a kexec()
