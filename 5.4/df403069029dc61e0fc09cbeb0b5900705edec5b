drm/i915/execlists: Lift process_csb() out of the irq-off spinlock

If we only call process_csb() from the tasklet, though we lose the
ability to bypass ksoftirqd interrupt processing on direct submission
paths, we can push it out of the irq-off spinlock.

The penalty is that we then allow schedule_out to be called concurrently
with schedule_in requiring us to handle the usage count (baked into the
pointer itself) atomically.

As we do kick the tasklets (via local_bh_enable()) after our submission,
there is a possibility there to see if we can pull the local softirq
processing back from the ksoftirqd.

v2: Store the 'switch_priority_hint' on submission, so that we can
safely check during process_csb().
