powerpc/of/pci: Rewrite pci_parse_of_flags

The existing code uses bunch of hardcoded values from the PCI Bus
Binding to IEEE Std 1275 spec; and it does so in quite non-obvious
way.

This defines fields from the cell#0 of the "reg" property of a PCI
device and uses them for parsing.

This should cause no behavioral change.
