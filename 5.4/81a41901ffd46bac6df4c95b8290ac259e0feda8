clk: ti: clkctrl: Fix failed to enable error with double udelay timeout

Commit 3d8598fb9c5a ("clk: ti: clkctrl: use fallback udelay approach if
timekeeping is suspended") added handling for cases when timekeeping is
suspended. But looks like we can still get occasional "failed to enable"
errors on the PM runtime resume path with udelay() returning faster than
expected.

With ti-sysc interconnect target module driver this leads into device
failure with PM runtime failing with "failed to enable" clkctrl error.

Let's fix the issue with a delay of two times the desired delay as in
often done for udelay() to account for the inaccuracy.
