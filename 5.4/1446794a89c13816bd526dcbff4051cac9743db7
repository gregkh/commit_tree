pm-graph v5.5

Upgrade bootgraph/sleepgraph to be able to run on python2 and python3.
Both now simply require python, the system can choose which to use.

bootgraph python3 update:
- add floor function to handle integer arithmetic
- change argument loop to use next() instead of args.next()
- open dmesg log and popen in binary, use decode(ascii, ignore)
- sort all html data to allow diff between python versions
- change exception handler to use python3 as instead of comma

sleepgraph python3 update:
- import configparser not ConfigParser (p2 needs python-configparser)
- add floor function to handle integer arithmetic
- change argument loop to use next() instead of args.next()
- handle popen output in binary, use decode(ascii, ignore)
- sort all html/output data to allow diff between python versions
- force gzip open to use text mode, same for file open
- ensure no binary data is written to logs (ascii convert devprops info)
- use codecs library to handle zlib encoding for mcelog data
- remove all uses of python3.7 keyword "async" as members or vars
- assume all FPDT and DMI data is in binary string form

sleepgraph:
- turbostat will be used by default if it's found & the mode is freeze
- a new option "-noturbostat" will disable its use
- fix bug where two callgraphs with the same start time overwrite.
- fix s2idle processing where two suspend/resume_machines occur back2back
- update getexec function to use which first (assuming PATH exists)
- new platforminfo data in log with: lspci, gpe counts, /proc/interrupts
- new data is zipped, b64 encoded, and tacked on the end of ftrace
