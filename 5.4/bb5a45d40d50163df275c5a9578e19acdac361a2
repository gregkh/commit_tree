drm/hdcp: update content protection property with uevent

drm function is defined and exported to update a connector's
content protection property state and to generate a uevent along
with it.

Pekka have completed the Weston DRM-backend review in
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/merge_requests/48
and the UAPI for HDCP 2.2 looks good.

The userspace is accepted in Weston.

  Update only when state is different from old one.
v3:
  KDoc is added [Daniel]
v4:
  KDoc is extended bit more [pekka]
v5:
  Uevent usage is documented at kdoc of "Content Protection" also
