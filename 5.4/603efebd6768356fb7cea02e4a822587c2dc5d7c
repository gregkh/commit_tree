xfs: remove broken error handling on failed attr sf to leaf change

xfs_attr_shortform_to_leaf() attempts to put the shortform fork back
together after a failed attempt to convert from shortform to leaf
format. While this code reallocates and copies back the shortform
attr fork data, it never resets the inode format field back to local
format. Further, now that the inode is properly logged after the
initial switch from local format, any error that triggers the
recovery code will eventually abort the transaction and shutdown the
fs. Therefore, remove the broken and unnecessary error handling
code.
