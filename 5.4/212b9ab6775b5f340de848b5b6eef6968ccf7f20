perf augmented_raw_syscalls: Augment sockaddr arg in 'connect'

We already had a beautifier for an augmented sockaddr payload, but that
was when we were hooking on each syscalls:sys_enter_foo tracepoints,
since now we're almost doing that by doing a tail call from
raw_syscalls:sys_enter, its almost the same, we can reuse it straight
away.

  # perf trace -e connec* ssh www.bla.com
  connect(3</var/lib/sss/mc/passwd>, { .family: PF_LOCAL, path: /var/run/nscd/socket }, 0x6e) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
