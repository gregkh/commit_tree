HID: logitech-hidpp: rework device validation

G920 device only advertises REPORT_ID_HIDPP_LONG and
REPORT_ID_HIDPP_VERY_LONG in its HID report descriptor, so querying
for REPORT_ID_HIDPP_SHORT with optional=false will always fail and
prevent G920 to be recognized as a valid HID++ device.

To fix this and improve some other aspects, modify
hidpp_validate_device() as follows:

  - Inline the code of hidpp_validate_report() to simplify
    distingushing between non-present and invalid report descriptors

  - Drop the check for id >= HID_MAX_IDS || id < 0 since all of our
    IDs are static and known to satisfy that at compile time

  - Change the algorithms to check all possible report
    types (including very long report) and deem the device as a valid
    HID++ device if it supports at least one

  - Treat invalid report length as a hard stop for the validation
    algorithm, meaning that if any of the supported reports has
    invalid length we assume the worst and treat the device as a
    generic HID device.

  - Fold initialization of hidpp->very_long_report_length into
    hidpp_validate_device() since it already fetches very long report
    length and validates its value
