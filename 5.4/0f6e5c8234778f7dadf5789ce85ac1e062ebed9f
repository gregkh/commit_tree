crypto: inside-secure - make driver selectable for non-Marvell hardware

While being a generic EIP97/EIP197 driver, the driver was only selectable
for Marvell Armada hardware. This fix makes the driver selectable for any
Device Tree supporting kernel configuration, allowing it to be used for
other compatible hardware by just adding the correct device tree entry.

It also allows the driver to be selected for PCI(E) supporting kernel con-
figurations, to be able to use it with PCIE based FPGA development boards
for pre-silicon driver development by both Inside Secure and its IP custo-
mers.
