arm64: dts: rockchip: fix Rockpro64 RK808 interrupt line

Fix the pinctrl and interrupt specifier for RK808 to use GPIO3_B2. On the
Rockpro64 schematic [1] page 16, it shows GPIO3_B2 used for the interrupt
line PMIC_INT_L from the RK808, and there's a note which translates as:
"PMU termination GPIO1_C5 changed to this".

Tested by setting an RTC wakealarm and checking /proc/interrupts counters.
Without this patch, neither the rockchip_gpio_irq counter for the RK808,
nor the RTC alarm counter increment when the alarm time is reached.
With this patch, both interrupt counters increment by 1 as expected.
