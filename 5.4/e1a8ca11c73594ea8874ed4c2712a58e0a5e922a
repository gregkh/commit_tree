i40e: fix hw_dbg usage in i40e_hmc_get_object_va

The mentioned function references a i40e_hw attribute, as parameter for
hw_dbg, but it doesn't exist in the function scope.
Fixes it by changing  parameters from i40e_hmc_info to i40e_hw which can
retrieve the necessary i40e_hmc_info.

v2:
 - Fixed reverse xmas tree code style issue as suggested by Jakub Kicinski
