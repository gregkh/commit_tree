clk: sunxi-ng: v3s: add Allwinner V3 support

Allwinner V3 has the same main die with V3s, but with more pins wired.
There's a I2S bus on V3 that is not available on V3s.

Add the V3-only peripheral's clocks and reset to the V3s CCU driver,
bound to a new V3 compatible string. The driver name is not changed
because it's part of the device tree binding (the header file name).
