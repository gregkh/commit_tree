tracing: Have trace events system open call tracing_open_generic_tr()

Instead of having the trace events system open call open code the taking of
the trace_array descriptor (with trace_array_get()) and then calling
trace_open_generic(), have it use the tracing_open_generic_tr() that does
the combination of the two. This requires making tracing_open_generic_tr()
global.
