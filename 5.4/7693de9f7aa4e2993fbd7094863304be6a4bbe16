clocksource/drivers/sh_mtu2: Do not loop using platform_get_irq_by_name()

As platform_get_irq_by_name() now prints an error when the interrupt
does not exist, looping over possibly non-existing interrupts causes the
printing of scary messages like:

    sh_mtu2 fcff0000.timer: IRQ tgi1a not found
    sh_mtu2 fcff0000.timer: IRQ tgi2a not found

Fix this by using the platform_irq_count() helper, to avoid touching
non-existent interrupts.  Limit the returned number of interrupts to the
maximum number of channels currently supported by the driver in a
future-proof way, i.e. using ARRAY_SIZE() instead of a hardcoded number.
