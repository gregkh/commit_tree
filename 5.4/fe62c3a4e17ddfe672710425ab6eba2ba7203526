vfs: Create fs_context-aware mount_bdev() replacement

Create a function, get_tree_bdev(), that is fs_context-aware and a
->get_tree() counterpart of mount_bdev().

It caches the block device pointer in the fs_context struct so that this
information can be passed into sget_fc()'s test and set functions.
