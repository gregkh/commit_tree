cifs: create a helper to find a writeable handle by path name

rename() takes a path for old_file and in SMB2 we used to just create
a compound for create(old_path)/rename/close().
If we already have a writable handle we can avoid the create() and close()
altogether and just use the existing handle.

For this situation, as we avoid doing the create()
we also avoid triggering an oplock break for the existing handle.
