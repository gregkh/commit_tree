ALSA: hda: Set fifo_size for both playback and capture streams

Currently we set hdac_stream.fifo_size field only for the playback
stream by some odd reason I forgot, while this field isn't referred in
any places.  Actually this fifo_size field would have been required in
the position report correction for VIA chipset, but due to the lack of
the fifo_size set for capture streams, snd-hda-intel driver fetches
the register by itself.

This patch straightens and simplifies the code by setting the
fifo_size field for both playback and capture streams, and use it in
the HD-audio controller driver.
