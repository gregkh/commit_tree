dt-bindings: display: hdmi-connector: Support DDC bus enable

Some Allwinner SoC using boards (Orange Pi 3 for example) need to enable
on-board voltage shifting logic for the DDC bus using a gpio to be able
to access DDC bus. Use ddc-en-gpios property on the hdmi-connector to
model this.

Add binding documentation for optional ddc-en-gpios property.
