dma-mapping: Remove dma_check_mask()

sme_active() is an x86-specific function so it's better not to call it from
generic code. Christoph Hellwig mentioned that "There is no reason why we
should have a special debug printk just for one specific reason why there
is a requirement for a large DMA mask.", so just remove dma_check_mask().
