ice: Set up Tx scheduling tree based on alloc VSI Tx queues

This patch uses allocated number of Tx queues per VSI to set up its
scheduling tree instead of using total number of available Tx queues.
Only PF VSIs have total number of allocated Tx queues equal to number
of available Tx queues, other VSIs have different number of queues
configured.
