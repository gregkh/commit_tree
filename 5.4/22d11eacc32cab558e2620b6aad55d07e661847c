ixgbe: fix memory leaks

In ixgbe_configure_clsu32(), 'jump', 'input', and 'mask' are allocated
through kzalloc() respectively in a for loop body. Then,
ixgbe_clsu32_build_input() is invoked to build the input. If this process
fails, next iteration of the for loop will be executed. However, the
allocated 'jump', 'input', and 'mask' are not deallocated on this execution
path, leading to memory leaks.
