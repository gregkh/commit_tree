ARM: 8875/1: Kconfig: default to AEABI w/ Clang

Clang produces references to __aeabi_uidivmod and __aeabi_idivmod for
arm-linux-gnueabi and arm-linux-gnueabihf targets incorrectly when AEABI
is not selected (such as when OABI_COMPAT is selected).

While this means that OABI userspaces wont be able to upgraded to
kernels built with Clang, it means that boards that don't enable AEABI
like s3c2410_defconfig will stop failing to link in KernelCI when built
with Clang.
