virtiofs: Count pending forgets as in_flight forgets

If virtqueue is full, we put forget requests on a list and these forgets
are dispatched later using a worker. As of now we don't count these forgets
in fsvq->in_flight variable. This means when queue is being drained, we
have to have special logic to first drain these pending requests and then
wait for fsvq->in_flight to go to zero.

By counting pending forgets in fsvq->in_flight, we can get rid of special
logic and just wait for in_flight to go to zero. Worker thread will kick
and drain all the forgets anyway, leading in_flight to zero.

I also need similar logic for normal request queue in next patch where I am
about to defer request submission in the worker context if queue is full.

This simplifies the code a bit.

Also add two helper functions to inc/dec in_flight. Decrement in_flight
helper will later used to call completion when in_flight reaches zero.
