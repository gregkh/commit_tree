powerpc/xive: Update comment referencing magic loads from an ESB

The comment above xive_esb_read() references magic loads from an ESB as
described xive.h. This has been inaccurate since commit 12c1f339cd49
("powerpc/xive: Move definition of ESB bits") which moved the
description. Update the comment to reference the new location of the
description in xive-regs.h
