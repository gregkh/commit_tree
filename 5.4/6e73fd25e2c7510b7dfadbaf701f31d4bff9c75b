Revert "mm/z3fold.c: fix race between migration and destruction"

With the original commit applied, z3fold_zpool_destroy() may get blocked
on wait_event() for indefinite time.  Revert this commit for the time
being to get rid of this problem since the issue the original commit
addresses is less severe.
