perf/aux: Disallow aux_output for kernel events

Commit

  ab43762ef0109 ("perf: Allow normal events to output AUX data")

added 'aux_output' bit to the attribute structure, which relies on AUX
events and grouping, neither of which is supported for the kernel events.
This notwithstanding, attempts have been made to use it in the kernel
code, suggesting the necessity of an explicit hard -EINVAL.

Fix this by rejecting attributes with aux_output set for kernel events.
