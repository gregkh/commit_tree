modpost: fix static EXPORT_SYMBOL warnings for UML build

When you run "make", the modpost is run twice; before linking vmlinux,
and before building modules. All the warnings above are from the second
modpost.

The offending symbols are defined not in vmlinux, but in the C library.
The first modpost is run against the relocatable vmlinux.o, and those
warnings are nicely suppressed because the SH_UNDEF entries from the
symbol table clear the ->is_static flag.

The second modpost is run against the executable vmlinux (+ modules),
where those symbols have been resolved, but the definitions do not
exist.

This commit fixes it in a straightforward way; suppress the static
EXPORT_SYMBOL warnings from "vmlinux".

Without this commit, we see valid warnings twice anyway. For example,
ARCH=arm64 defconfig shows the following warning twice:

WARNING: "HYPERVISOR_platform_op" [vmlinux] is a static EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL

So, it is reasonable to suppress the second one.
