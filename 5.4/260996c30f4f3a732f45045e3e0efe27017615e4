pinctrl: cherryview: restore Strago DMI workaround for all versions

This is essentially a revert of:

e3f72b749da2 pinctrl: cherryview: fix Strago DMI workaround
86c5dd6860a6 pinctrl: cherryview: limit Strago DMI workarounds to version 1.0

because even with 1.1 versions of BIOS there are some pins that are
configured as interrupts but not claimed by any driver, and they
sometimes fire up and result in interrupt storms that cause touchpad
stop functioning and other issues.

Given that we are unlikely to qualify another firmware version for a
while it is better to keep the workaround active on all Strago boards.
