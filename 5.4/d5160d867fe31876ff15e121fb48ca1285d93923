mt76: mt76x02: do not copy beacon skb in mt76x02_mac_set_beacon_enable

Do not copy beacon skb in mt76x02_mac_set_beacon_enable for usb devices
since it will be done in mt76x02_update_beacon_iter. Moreover squash
mt76x02_mac_set_beacon_enable and __mt76x02_mac_set_beacon_enable since
the latter is run just by mt76x02_mac_set_beacon_enable
