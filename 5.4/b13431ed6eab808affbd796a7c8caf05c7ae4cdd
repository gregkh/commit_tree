pinctrl: sh-pfc: Remove incomplete flag "cfg->type"

The old commit c58d9c1b26e3 ("sh-pfc: Implement generic pinconf
support") broke the cfg->type flag to PINMUX_TYPE_FUNCTION because
sh_pfc_pinconf_set() didn't call sh_pfc_reconfig_pin().
Now if we fix the cfg->type condition, it gets worse because:
 - Some drivers might be deferred so that .set_mux() will be called
   multiple times.
 - In such the case, the sh-pfc driver returns -EBUSY even if
   the group is the same, and then that driver fails to probe.

Since the pinctrl subsystem already has such conditions according
to @set_mux and @gpio_request_enable, this patch just remove
the incomplete flag from sh-pfc/pinctrl.c.
