powerpc/fadump: make crash memory ranges array allocation generic

Make allocate_crash_memory_ranges() and free_crash_memory_ranges()
functions generic to reuse them for memory management of all types of
dynamic memory range arrays. This change helps in memory management
of reserved ranges array to be added later.
