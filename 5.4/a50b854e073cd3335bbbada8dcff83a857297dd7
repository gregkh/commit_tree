mm: introduce page_size()

Patch series "Make working with compound pages easier", v2.

These three patches add three helpers and convert the appropriate
places to use them.

This patch (of 3):

It's unnecessarily hard to find out the size of a potentially huge page.
Replace 'PAGE_SIZE << compound_order(page)' with page_size(page).
