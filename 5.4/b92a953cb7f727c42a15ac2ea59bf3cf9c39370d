lib/test_kasan.c: add roundtrip tests

In several places we need to be able to operate on pointers which have
gone via a roundtrip:

	virt -> {phys,page} -> virt

With KASAN_SW_TAGS, we can't preserve the tag for SLUB objects, and the
{phys,page} -> virt conversion will use KASAN_TAG_KERNEL.

This patch adds tests to ensure that this works as expected, without
false positives which have recently been spotted [1,2] in testing.
