drm/i915/execlists: Keep virtual context alive until after we kick

The call to kick_siblings() dereferences the rq->context, so we should
not drop our local reference until afterwards!

v2: Stick to setting ce.inflight=NULL before kicking as this is what the
other threads will check to see if the context is ready for takeover.
