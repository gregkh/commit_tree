dm: make dm_table_find_target return NULL

Currently, if we pass too high sector number to dm_table_find_target, it
returns zeroed dm_target structure and callers test if the structure is
zeroed with the macro dm_target_is_valid.

However, returning NULL is common practice to indicate errors.

This patch refactors the dm code, so that dm_table_find_target returns
NULL and its callers test the returned value for NULL. The macro
dm_target_is_valid is deleted. In alloc_targets, we no longer allocate an
extra zeroed target.
