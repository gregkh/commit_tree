mm/zsmalloc.c: fix a -Wunused-function warning

set_zspage_inuse() was introduced in the commit 4f42047bbde0 ("zsmalloc:
use accessor") but all the users of it were removed later by the commits,

bdb0af7ca8f0 ("zsmalloc: factor page chain functionality out")
3783689a1aa8 ("zsmalloc: introduce zspage structure")

so the function can be safely removed now.
