KVM: VMX: Change ple_window type to unsigned int

The VMX ple_window is 32 bits wide, so logically it can overflow with
an int.  The module parameter is declared as unsigned int which is
good, however the dynamic variable is not.  Switching all the
ple_window references to use unsigned int.

The tracepoint changes will also affect SVM, but SVM is using an even
smaller width (16 bits) so it's always fine.
