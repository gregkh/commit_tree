ASoC: codec2codec: deal with params when necessary

When there is an event on codec to codec dai_link, we only need to deal
with params if the event is SND_SOC_DAPM_PRE_PMU, when .hw_params() is
called. For the other events, it is useless.

Also, dealing with the codec to codec params just before calling
.hw_params() callbacks give change to either party on the link to alter
params content in .startup(), which might be useful in some cases
