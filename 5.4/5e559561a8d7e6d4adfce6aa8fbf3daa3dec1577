io_uring: ensure registered buffer import returns the IO length

A test case was reported where two linked reads with registered buffers
failed the second link always. This is because we set the expected value
of a request in req->result, and if we don't get this result, then we
fail the dependent links. For some reason the registered buffer import
returned -ERROR/0, while the normal import returns -ERROR/length. This
broke linked commands with registered buffers.

Fix this by making io_import_fixed() correctly return the mapped length.
