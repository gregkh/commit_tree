ALSA: hda - Fix mutex deadlock in HDMI codec driver

The commit ade49db337a9 ("ALSA: hda/hdmi - Allow audio component for
AMD/ATI and Nvidia HDMI") introduced the spec->pcm_lock mutex lock to
the whole generic_hdmi_init() function for avoiding the race with the
audio component registration.  However, this caused a dead lock when
the unsolicited event is handled without the audio component, as the
codec gets runtime-resumed in hdmi_present_sense() which is already
inside the spec->pcm_lock in its caller.

For avoiding this deadlock, add a new mutex only for the audio
component binding that is used in both generic_hdmi_init() and the
audio notifier registration where the jack callbacks are handled /
re-registered.
