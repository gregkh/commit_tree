PM: sleep: Drop dpm_noirq_begin() and dpm_noirq_end()

Note that after previous changes dpm_noirq_begin() and
dpm_noirq_end() each have only one caller, so move the code from
them to their respective callers and drop them.

Also note that dpm_noirq_resume_devices() and
dpm_noirq_suspend_devices() need not be exported any more, so make
them both static.

This change is not expected to alter functionality.
