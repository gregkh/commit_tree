powerpc/eeh: Check slot presence state in eeh_handle_normal_event()

When a device is surprise removed while undergoing IO we will probably
get an EEH PE freeze due to MMIO timeouts and other errors. When a freeze
is detected we send a recovery event to the EEH worker thread which will
notify drivers, and perform recovery as needed.

In the event of a hot-remove we don't want recovery to occur since there
isn't a device to recover. The recovery process is fairly long due to
the number of wait states (required by PCIe) which causes problems when
devices are removed and replaced (e.g. hot swapping of U.2 NVMe drives).

To determine if we need to skip the recovery process we can use the
get_adapter_state() operation of the hotplug_slot to determine if the
slot contains a device or not, and if the slot is empty we can skip
recovery entirely.

One thing to note is that the slot being EEH frozen does not prevent the
hotplug driver from working. We don't have the EEH recovery thread
remove any of the devices since it's assumed that the hotplug driver
will handle tearing down the slot state.
