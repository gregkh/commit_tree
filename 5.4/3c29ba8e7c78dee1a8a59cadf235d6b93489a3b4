Revert "ARM: dts: rockchip: add startup delay to rk3288-veyron panel-regulators"

This reverts commit 1f45e8c6d0161f044d679f242fe7514e2625af4a.

This 100 ms mystery delay is not on downstream kernels and no longer
seems needed on upstream kernels either [1].  Presumably something in the
meantime has made things better.  A few possibilities for patches that
have landed in the meantime that could have made this better are
commit 3157694d8c7f ("pwm-backlight: Add support for PWM delays
proprieties."), commit 5fb5caee92ba ("pwm-backlight: Enable/disable
the PWM before/after LCD enable toggle."), and commit 6d5922dd0d60
("ARM: dts: rockchip: set PWM delay backlight settings for Veyron")

Let's revert and get our 100 ms back.
