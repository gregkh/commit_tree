Input: allow drivers specify timestamp for input events

Currently, evdev stamps events with timestamps acquired in evdev_events()
However, this timestamping may not be accurate in terms of measuring
when the actual event happened.

Let's allow individual drivers specify timestamp in order to provide a more
accurate sense of time for the event. It is expected that drivers will set the
timestamp in their hard interrupt routine.
