soc: fsl: qe: reduce static memory footprint by 1.7K

The current array of struct qe_snum use 256*4 bytes for just keeping
track of the free/used state of each index, and the struct layout
means there's another 768 bytes of padding. If we just unzip that
structure, the array of snum values just use 256 bytes, while the
free/inuse state can be tracked in a 32 byte bitmap.

So this reduces the .data footprint by 1760 bytes. It also serves as
preparation for introducing another DT binding for specifying the snum
values.
