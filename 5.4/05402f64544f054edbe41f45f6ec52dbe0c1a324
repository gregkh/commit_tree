x86: KVM: svm: don't pretend to advance RIP in case wrmsr_interception() results in #GP

svm->next_rip is only used by skip_emulated_instruction() and in case
kvm_set_msr() fails we rightfully don't do that. Move svm->next_rip
advancement to 'else' branch to avoid creating false impression that
it's always advanced (and make it look like rdmsr_interception()).

This is a preparatory change to removing hardcoded RIP advancement
from instruction intercepts, no functional change.
