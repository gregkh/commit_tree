ALSA: usb-audio: Scarlett Gen 2 mixer interface

Add mixer quirk for the Focusrite Scarlett 6i6, 18i8, and 18i20 Gen 2
audio interfaces. Although the interfaces are USB compliant,
additional input/output level controls and hardware routing/mixing
functionality are available using proprietary USB requests.
