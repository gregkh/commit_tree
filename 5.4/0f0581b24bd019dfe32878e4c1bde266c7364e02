spi: fsl: Convert to use CS GPIO descriptors

This converts the Freescale SPI master driver to use GPIO
descriptors for chip select handling.

The Freescale (fsl) driver has a lot of quirks to look up
"gpios" rather than "cs-gpios" from the device tree.
After the prior patch that will make gpiolib return the
GPIO descriptor for "gpios" in response to a request for
"cs-gpios", this code can be cut down quite a bit.

The driver has custom handling of chip select rather
than using the core (which may be possible but not
done in this patch) so it still needs to refer directly
to spi->cs_gpiod to set the chip select.
