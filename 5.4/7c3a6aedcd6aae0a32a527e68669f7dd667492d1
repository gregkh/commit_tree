kexec: bail out upon SIGKILL when allocating memory.

syzbot found that a thread can stall for minutes inside kexec_load() after
that thread was killed by SIGKILL [1].  It turned out that the reproducer
was trying to allocate 2408MB of memory using kimage_alloc_page() from
kimage_load_normal_segment().  Let's check for SIGKILL before doing memory
allocation.
