net: dsa: enable and disable all ports

Call the .port_enable and .port_disable functions for all ports,
not only the user ports, so that drivers may optimize the power
consumption of all ports after a successful setup.

Unused ports are now disabled on setup. CPU and DSA ports are now
enabled on setup and disabled on teardown. User ports were already
enabled at slave creation and disabled at slave destruction.
