iommu: Introduce struct iommu_iotlb_gather for batching TLB flushes

To permit batching of TLB flushes across multiple calls to the IOMMU
driver's ->unmap() implementation, introduce a new structure for
tracking the address range to be flushed and the granularity at which
the flushing is required.

This is hooked into the IOMMU API and its caller are updated to make use
of the new structure. Subsequent patches will plumb this into the IOMMU
drivers as well, but for now the gathering information is ignored.
