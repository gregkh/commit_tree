KVM: Assert that struct kvm_vcpu is always as offset zero

KVM implementations that wrap struct kvm_vcpu with a vendor specific
struct, e.g. struct vcpu_vmx, must place the vcpu member at offset 0,
otherwise the usercopy region intended to encompass struct kvm_vcpu_arch
will instead overlap random chunks of the vendor specific struct.
E.g. padding a large number of bytes before struct kvm_vcpu triggers
a usercopy warn when running with CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY=y.
