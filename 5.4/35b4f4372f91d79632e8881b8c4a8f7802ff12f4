ice: fix ice_is_tc_ena

ice_is_tc_ena is used to check whether a given traffic class is
enabled. Because there are only 8 traffic classes, the function took
a u8 bitmap. This causes problems because it is cast to an unsigned
long causing a static analysis warning regarding Out-of-bounds read.

Fix this by simply updating ice_is_tc_ena to take an unsigned long.
Passing a u8 to this function should implicitly convert the value.
