KVM: x86: Refactor kvm_vcpu_do_singlestep() to remove out param

Return the single-step emulation result directly instead of via an out
param.  Presumably at some point in the past kvm_vcpu_do_singlestep()
could be called with *r==EMULATE_USER_EXIT, but that is no longer the
case, i.e. all callers are happy to overwrite their own return variable.
