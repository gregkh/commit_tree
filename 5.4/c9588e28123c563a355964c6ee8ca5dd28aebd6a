mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Track rules that forbid egress block bind

Some matches and actions are not supported on egress. Track such rules
and forbid a bind of block which contains them to egress.

With this patch, the kernel tells the user he cannot do that:
$ tc qdisc add dev ens16np1 ingress_block 22 clsact
$ tc filter add block 22 protocol 802.1q pref 2 handle 101 flower vlan_id 100 skip_sw action pass
$ tc qdisc add dev ens16np2 egress_block 22 clsact
Error: mlxsw_spectrum: Block cannot be bound to egress because it contains unsupported rules.
