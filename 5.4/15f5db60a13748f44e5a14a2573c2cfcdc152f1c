kbuild,arc: add CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE_O3 for ARC

arch/arc/Makefile overrides -O2 with -O3. This is the only user of
ARCH_CFLAGS. There is no user of ARCH_CPPFLAGS or ARCH_AFLAGS.
My plan is to remove ARCH_{CPP,A,C}FLAGS after refactoring the ARC
Makefile.

Currently, ARC has no way to enable -Wmaybe-uninitialized because both
-O3 and -Os disable it. Enabling it will be useful for compile-testing.
This commit allows allmodconfig (, which defaults to -O2) to enable it.

Add CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE_O3=y to all the defconfig files
in arch/arc/configs/ in order to keep the current config settings.
