drop_monitor: Rename and document scope of mutex

The 'trace_state_mutex' does not only protect the global 'trace_state'
variable, but also the global 'hw_stats_list'.

Subsequent patches are going add more operations from user space to
drop_monitor and these all need to be mutually exclusive.

Rename 'trace_state_mutex' to the more fitting 'net_dm_mutex' name and
document its scope.
