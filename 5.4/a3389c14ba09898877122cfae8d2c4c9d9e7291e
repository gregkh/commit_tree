Revert "drm/i915: Introduce private PAT management"

This reverts commit 4395890a48551982549d222d1923e2833dac47cf.

It's been over a year since this was merged, and the actual users of
intel_ppat_get / intel_ppat_put never materialized.

Time to remove it!

v2: Unbreak suspend (Chris)
v3: Rebase, drop fixes tag to avoid confusion
