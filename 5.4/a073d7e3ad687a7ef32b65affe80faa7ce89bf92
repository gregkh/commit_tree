KVM: hyperv: Fix Direct Synthetic timers assert an interrupt w/o lapic_in_kernel

Reported by syzkaller:

	kasan: GPF could be caused by NULL-ptr deref or user memory access
	general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN

The testcase programs HV_X64_MSR_STIMERn_CONFIG/HV_X64_MSR_STIMERn_COUNT,
in addition, there is no lapic in the kernel, the counters value are small
enough in order that kvm_hv_process_stimers() inject this already-expired
timer interrupt into the guest through lapic in the kernel which triggers
the NULL deferencing. This patch fixes it by don't advertise direct mode
synthetic timers and discarding the inject when lapic is not in kernel.
