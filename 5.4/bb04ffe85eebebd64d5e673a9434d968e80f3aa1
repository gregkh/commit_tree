powerpc/powernv: Introduce FW_FEATURE_ULTRAVISOR

In PEF enabled systems, some of the resources which were previously
hypervisor privileged are now ultravisor privileged and controlled by
the ultravisor firmware.

This adds FW_FEATURE_ULTRAVISOR to indicate if PEF is enabled.

The host kernel can use FW_FEATURE_ULTRAVISOR, for instance, to skip
accessing resources (e.g. PTCR and LDBAR) in case PEF is enabled.
