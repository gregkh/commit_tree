PCI: Clean up resource_alignment parameter to not require static buffer

Clean up the 'resource_alignment' parameter code to use kstrdup() in the
initcall routine instead of a static buffer that wastes memory regardless
of whether the feature is used.  This allows us to drop 'COMMAND_LINE_SIZE'
bytes (typically 256-4096 depending on architecture) of static data.

This is similar to what has been done for the 'disable_acs_redir'
parameter.
