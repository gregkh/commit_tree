Documentation: sysrq: don't recommend 'S' 'U' before 'B'

This advice is obsolete and slightly harmful for filesystems from this
millenium: any modern filesystem can handle unexpected crashes without
requiring fsck -- and on the other hand, trying to write to the disk when
the kernel is in a bad state risks introducing corruption.

For ext2, any unsafe shutdown meant widespread breakage, but it's no longer
a reasonable filesystem for any non-special use.
