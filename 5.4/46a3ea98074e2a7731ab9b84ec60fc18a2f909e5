net/mlx5e: kTLS, Enhance TX resync flow

Once the kTLS TX resync function is called, it used to return
a binary value, for success or failure.

However, in case the TLS SKB is a retransmission of the connection
handshake, it initiates the resync flow (as the tcp seq check holds),
while regular packet handle is expected.

In this patch, we identify this case and skip the resync operation
accordingly.

Counters:
- Add a counter (tls_skip_no_sync_data) to monitor this.
- Bump the dump counters up as they are used more frequently.
- Add a missing counter descriptor declaration for tls_resync_bytes
  in sq_stats_desc.
