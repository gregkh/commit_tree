devlink: Add method for time-stamp on reporter's dump

When setting the dump's time-stamp, use ktime_get_real in addition to
jiffies. This simplifies the user space implementation and bypasses
some inconsistent behavior with translating jiffies to current time.
The time taken is transformed into nsec, to comply with y2038 issue.
