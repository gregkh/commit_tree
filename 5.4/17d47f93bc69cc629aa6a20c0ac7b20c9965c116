xprtrdma: Fix bc_max_slots return value

For the moment the returned value just happens to be correct because
the current backchannel server implementation does not vary the
number of credits it offers. The spec does permit this value to
change during the lifetime of a connection, however.

The actual maximum is fixed for all RPC/RDMA transports, because
each transport instance has to pre-allocate the resources for
processing BC requests. That's the value that should be returned.
