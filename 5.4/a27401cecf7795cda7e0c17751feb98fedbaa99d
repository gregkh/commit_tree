ARM: dts: am335x-boneblue: Use of am335x-osd335x-common.dtsi

This makes use of the am335x-osd335x-common.dtsi file that contains the
common device tree components for Octavo Systems AM335x System-in-
Package that is used on the BeagleBone Blue.

This has two minor side-effects:
1. pinmux_i2c0_pins is renamed to pinmux-i2c0-pins
2. the 1000MHz cpufreq operating point is enabled
