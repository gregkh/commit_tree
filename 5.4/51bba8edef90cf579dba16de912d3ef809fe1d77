powerpc/fadump: support copying multiple kernel boot memory regions

Firmware uses a 32-bit field for size while copying/backing-up memory
during MPIPL. So, the maximum value that could be represented with
a PAGE_SIZE aligned 32-bit field will be the maximum copy size for a
region but FADump capture kernel usually needs more memory than that
to be preserved to avoid running into out of memory errors.

So, request firmware to copy multiple kernel boot memory regions
instead of just one (which worked fine for pseries as 64-bit field
was used for size there).
