nfsd: hook up nfs4_preprocess_stateid_op to the nfsd_file cache

Have nfs4_preprocess_stateid_op pass back a nfsd_file instead of a filp.
Since we now presume that the struct file will be persistent in most
cases, we can stop fiddling with the raparms in the read code. This
also means that we don't really care about the rd_tmp_file field
anymore.
