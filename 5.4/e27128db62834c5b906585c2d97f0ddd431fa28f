kbuild: rename KBUILD_ENABLE_EXTRA_GCC_CHECKS to KBUILD_EXTRA_WARN

KBUILD_ENABLE_EXTRA_GCC_CHECKS started as a switch to add extra warning
options for GCC, but now it is a historical misnomer since we use it
also for Clang, DTC, and even kernel-doc.

Rename it to more sensible, shorter KBUILD_EXTRA_WARN.

For the backward compatibility, KBUILD_ENABLE_EXTRA_GCC_CHECKS is still
supported (but not advertised in the documentation).

I also fixed up 'make help', and updated the documentation.
