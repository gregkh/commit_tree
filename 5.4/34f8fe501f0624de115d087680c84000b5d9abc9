bdi: Add bdi->id

There currently is no way to universally identify and lookup a bdi
without holding a reference and pointer to it.  This patch adds an
non-recycling bdi->id and implements bdi_get_by_id() which looks up
bdis by their ids.  This will be used by memcg foreign inode flushing.

I left bdi_list alone for simplicity and because while rb_tree does
support rcu assignment it doesn't seem to guarantee lossless walk when
walk is racing aginst tree rebalance operations.
