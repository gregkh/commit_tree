drm/amdgpu: fix stack alignment ABI mismatch for Clang

The x86 kernel is compiled with an 8B stack alignment via
`-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3` for GCC since 3.6-rc1 via
commit d9b0cde91c60 ("x86-64, gcc: Use -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 if supported")
or `-mstack-alignment=8` for Clang. Parts of the AMDGPU driver are
compiled with 16B stack alignment.

Generally, the stack alignment is part of the ABI. Linking together two
different translation units with differing stack alignment is dangerous,
particularly when the translation unit with the smaller stack alignment
makes calls into the translation unit with the larger stack alignment.
While 8B aligned stacks are sometimes also 16B aligned, they are not
always.

Multiple users have reported General Protection Faults (GPF) when using
the AMDGPU driver compiled with Clang. Clang is placing objects in stack
slots assuming the stack is 16B aligned, and selecting instructions that
require 16B aligned memory operands.

At runtime, syscall handlers with 8B aligned stack call into code that
assumes 16B stack alignment.  When the stack is a multiple of 8B but not
16B, these instructions result in a GPF.

Remove the code that added compatibility between the differing compiler
flags, as it will result in runtime GPFs when built with Clang. Cleanups
for GCC will be sent in later patches in the series.
