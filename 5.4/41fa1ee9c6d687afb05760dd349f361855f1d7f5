acpi: Ignore acpi_rsdp kernel param when the kernel has been locked down

This option allows userspace to pass the RSDP address to the kernel, which
makes it possible for a user to modify the workings of hardware. Reject
the option when the kernel is locked down. This requires some reworking
of the existing RSDP command line logic, since the early boot code also
makes use of a command-line passed RSDP when locating the SRAT table
before the lockdown code has been initialised. This is achieved by
separating the command line RSDP path in the early boot code from the
generic RSDP path, and then copying the command line RSDP into boot
params in the kernel proper if lockdown is not enabled. If lockdown is
enabled and an RSDP is provided on the command line, this will only be
used when parsing SRAT (which shouldn't permit kernel code execution)
and will be ignored in the rest of the kernel.

environment)
