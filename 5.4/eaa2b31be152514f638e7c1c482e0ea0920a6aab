drm/i915: Skip SINK_COUNT read on CH7511

CH7511 doesn't update SINK_COUNT properly so in order to detect
the device as connected we have to ignore SINK_COUNT.

In order to have access to the quirk list early enough we
must move the drm_dp_read_desc() call to happen earlier.
We can also skip re-reading this on eDP since we know it
won't change.
