ceph: increment/decrement dio counter on async requests

Ceph can in some cases issue an async DIO request, in which case we can
end up calling ceph_end_io_direct before the I/O is actually complete.
That may allow buffered operations to proceed while DIO requests are
still in flight.

Fix this by incrementing the i_dio_count when issuing an async DIO
request, and decrement it when tearing down the aio_req.
