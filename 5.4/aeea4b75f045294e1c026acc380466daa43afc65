xfs: move local to extent inode logging into bmap helper

The callers of xfs_bmap_local_to_extents_empty() log the inode
external to the function, yet this function is where the on-disk
format value is updated. Push the inode logging down into the
function itself to help prevent future mistakes.

Note that internal bmap callers track the inode logging flags
independently and thus may log the inode core twice due to this
change. This is harmless, so leave this code around for consistency
with the other attr fork conversion functions.
