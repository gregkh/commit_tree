spi: bcm2835: Work around DONE bit erratum

Commit 3bd7f6589f67 ("spi: bcm2835: Overcome sglist entry length
limitation") amended the BCM2835 SPI driver with support for DMA
transfers whose buffers are not aligned to 4 bytes and require more than
one sglist entry.

When testing this feature with upcoming commits to speed up TX-only and
RX-only transfers, I noticed that SPI transmission sometimes breaks.
A function introduced by the commit, bcm2835_spi_transfer_prologue(),
performs one or two PIO transmissions as a prologue to the actual DMA
transmission.  It turns out that the breakage goes away if the DONE bit
in the CS register is set when ending such a PIO transmission.

The DONE bit signifies emptiness of the TX FIFO.  According to the spec,
the bit is of type RO, so writing it should never have any effect.
Perhaps the spec is wrong and the bit is actually of type RW1C.
E.g. the I2C controller on the BCM2835 does have an RW1C DONE bit which
needs to be cleared by the driver.  Another, possibly more likely
explanation is that it's a hardware erratum since the issue does not
occur consistently.

Either way, amend bcm2835_spi_transfer_prologue() to always write the
DONE bit.

Usually a transmission is ended by bcm2835_spi_reset_hw().  If the
transmission was successful, the TX FIFO is empty and thus the DONE bit
is set when bcm2835_spi_reset_hw() reads the CS register.  The bit is
then written back to the register, so we happen to do the right thing.

However if DONE is not set, e.g. because transmission is aborted with
a non-empty TX FIFO, the bit won't be written by bcm2835_spi_reset_hw()
and it seems possible that transmission might subsequently break.  To be
on the safe side, likewise amend bcm2835_spi_reset_hw() to always write
the bit.
