tcp: Add TCP_INFO counter for packets received out-of-order

For receive-heavy cases on the server-side, we want to track the
connection quality for individual client IPs. This counter, similar to
the existing system-wide TCPOFOQueue counter in /proc/net/netstat,
tracks out-of-order packet reception. By providing this counter in
TCP_INFO, it will allow understanding to what degree receive-heavy
sockets are experiencing out-of-order delivery and packet drops
indicating congestion.

Please note that this is similar to the counter in NetBSD TCP_INFO, and
has the same name.

Also note that we avoid increasing the size of the tcp_sock struct by
taking advantage of a hole.
