drm/amd/display: Fix frames_to_insert math

[Why]
The math on deciding on how many
"frames to insert" sometimes sent us over the max refresh rate.
Also integer overflow can occur if we have high refresh rates.

[How]
Instead of clipping the  frame duration such that it doesnâ€™t go below the min,
just remove a frame from the number of frames to insert. +
Use unsigned long long for intermediate calculations to prevent
integer overflow.
