virtio_console: allocate inbufs in add_port() only if it is needed

When we hot unplug a virtserialport and then try to hot plug again,
it fails:

(qemu) chardev-add socket,id=serial0,path=/tmp/serial0,server,nowait
(qemu) device_add virtserialport,bus=virtio-serial0.0,nr=2,\
                  chardev=serial0,id=serial0,name=serial0
(qemu) device_del serial0
(qemu) device_add virtserialport,bus=virtio-serial0.0,nr=2,\
                  chardev=serial0,id=serial0,name=serial0
kernel error:
  virtio-ports vport2p2: Error allocating inbufs
qemu error:
  virtio-serial-bus: Guest failure in adding port 2 for device \
                     virtio-serial0.0

This happens because buffers for the in_vq are allocated when the port is
added but are not released when the port is unplugged.

They are only released when virtconsole is removed (see a7a69ec0d8e4)

To avoid the problem and to be symmetric, we could allocate all the buffers
in init_vqs() as they are released in remove_vqs(), but it sounds like
a waste of memory.

Rather than that, this patch changes add_port() logic to ignore ENOSPC
error in fill_queue(), which means queue has already been filled.
