btrfs: refactor variable scope in run_delalloc_nocow

Of the 22 (!!!) local variables declared in this function only 9 have
function-wide context. Of the remaining 13, 12 are needed in the main
while loop of the function and 1 is needed in a tiny if branch, only in
case we have prealloc extent. This commit reduces the lifespan of every
variable to its bare minimum. It also renames the 'nolock' boolean to
freespace_inode to clearly indicate its purpose.
