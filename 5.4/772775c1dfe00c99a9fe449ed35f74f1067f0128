net: lpc-enet: fix badzero.cocci warnings

drivers/net/ethernet/nxp/lpc_eth.c:1316:31-32: WARNING comparing pointer to 0

 Compare pointer-typed values to NULL rather than 0

Semantic patch information:
 This makes an effort to choose between !x and x == NULL.  !x is used
 if it has previously been used with the function used to initialize x.
 This relies on type information.  More type information can be obtained
 using the option -all_includes and the option -I to specify an
 include path.
