serial: tegra: check for FIFO mode enabled status

Chips prior to Tegra186 needed delay of 3 UART clock cycles to avoid
data loss. This issue is fixed in Tegra186 and a new flag is added to
check if FIFO mode is enabled. chip data updated to check if this flag
is available for a chip. Tegra186 has new compatible to enable this
flag.
