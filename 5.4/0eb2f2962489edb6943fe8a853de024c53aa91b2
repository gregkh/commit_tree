selinux: shuffle around policydb.c to get rid of forward declarations

No code changes, but move a lot of the policydb destructors higher up
so we can get rid of a forward declaration.

This patch does expose a few old checkpatch.pl errors, but those will
be dealt with in a separate (set of) patches.
