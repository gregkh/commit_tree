arm64: dts: renesas: r8a774a1: Use extended audio dmac registers

Basic audio dmac register only supports busif from 0 to 3,
in order to use busif4 ~ busif7 extended audio dmac registers
need to be used.

Based on similar work from Jiada Wang in commit 7a516e49d975 ("arm64:
dts: renesas: use extended audio dmac register").
