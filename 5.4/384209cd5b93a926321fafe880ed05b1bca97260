block: create a bio_try_merge_pc_page helper

Passsthrough bio handling should be the same as normal bio handling,
except that we need to take hardware limitations into account.  Thus
use the common try_merge implementation after checking the hardware
limits.  This changes behavior in that we now also check segment
and dma boundary settings for same page merges, which is a little
more work but has no effect as those need to be larger than the
page size.
