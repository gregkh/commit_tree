recordmcount: Remove uread()

uread() is only used to initialize the ELF file's pseudo
private-memory mapping while uwrite() and ulseek() work within
the pseudo-mapping and extend it as necessary.  Thus it is not
a complementary function to uwrite() and ulseek(). It also makes
no sense to do cleanups inside uread() when its only caller,
mmap_file(), is doing the relevant allocations and associated
initializations.

Therefore it's clearer to use a plain read() call to initialize the
data in mmap_file() and remove uread().
