perf tools: Remove needless evlist.h include directives

Remove the last unneeded use of cache.h in a header, we can check where
it is really needed, i.e. we can remove it and be sure that it isn't
being obtained indirectly.

This is an old file, used by now incorrectly in many places, so it was
providing includes needed indirectly, fixup this fallout.
