drm/i915: Convert a few more bland dmesg info to be device specific

Looking around the GT initialisation, we have a few log messages we
think are interesting enough present to the user (such as the amount of L4
cache) and a few to inform them of the result of actions or conflicting
HW restrictions (i.e. quirks). These are device specific messages, so
use the dev family of printk.

v2: shave off a few bytes of .rodata!
