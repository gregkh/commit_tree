PTP: introduce new versions of IOCTLs

The current version of the IOCTL have a small problem which prevents us
from extending the API by making use of reserved fields. In these new
IOCTLs, we are now making sure that flags and rsv fields are zero which
will allow us to extend the API in the future.
