sgi-xp: xpc_uv: Make structure xpc_arch_ops_uv constant

The static xpc_arch_operations structure xpc_arch_ops_uv is only copied
into the structure xpc_arch_ops, after which it is never modified; nor
is it used in any other way. Hence it can be declared as a constant to
prevent unintended modifications of its fields.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
