staging: erofs: tidy up decompression frontend

Although this patch has an amount of changes, it is hard to
separate into smaller patches.

Most changes are due to structure renaming for better understand
and straightforward,
 z_erofs_vle_workgroup to z_erofs_pcluster
             since it represents a physical cluster;
 z_erofs_vle_work to z_erofs_collection
             since it represents a collection of logical pages;
 z_erofs_vle_work_builder to z_erofs_collector
             since it's used to fill z_erofs_{pcluster,collection}.

struct z_erofs_vle_work_finder has no extra use compared with
struct z_erofs_collector, delete it.

FULL_LENGTH bit is integrated into .length of pcluster so that it
can be updated with the corresponding length change in atomic.

Minor, add comments for better description.
