tools: bpftool: do not link twice against libbpf.a in Makefile

In bpftool's Makefile, $(LIBS) includes $(LIBBPF), therefore the library
is used twice in the linking command. No need to have $(LIBBPF) (from
$^) on that command, let's do with "$(OBJS) $(LIBS)" (but move $(LIBBPF)
_before_ the -l flags in $(LIBS)).
