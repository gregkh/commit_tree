f2fs: allocate memory in batch in build_sit_info()

build_sit_info() allocate all bitmaps for each segment one by one,
it's quite low efficiency, this pach changes to allocate large
continuous memory at a time, and divide it and assign for each bitmaps
of segment. For large size image, it can expect improving its mount
speed.
