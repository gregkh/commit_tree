ice: Report VF link status with opcode to get resources

This patch changes how and when the driver report link status, instead of
waiting till the call to enable queues for VF, we should report link
status earlier with opcode to get VF resources - So as to avoid reporting
erroneous information, especially when queues have not been configured.
In addition, we can also make a call to get and report link status change
after when queue is enabled, at least to report netdev or PHY link status.
This is in accordance to how link speed is being reported for PF...
