memory: mtk-smi: Use a struct for the platform data for smi-common

Use a struct as the platform special data instead of the enumeration.

Also there is a minor change that moving the position of
"enum mtk_smi_gen" definition, this is because we expect define
"struct mtk_smi_common_plat" before it is referred.

This is a preparing patch for mt8183.
