vfs: Convert spufs to use the new mount API

Convert the spufs filesystem to the new internal mount API as the old
one will be obsoleted and removed.  This allows greater flexibility in
communication of mount parameters between userspace, the VFS and the
filesystem.

See Documentation/filesystems/mount_api.txt for more information.
