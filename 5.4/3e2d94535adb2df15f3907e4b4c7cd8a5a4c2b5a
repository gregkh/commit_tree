clocksource/drivers/hyperv: Enable TSC page clocksource on 32bit

There is no particular reason to not enable TSC page clocksource on
32-bit. mul_u64_u64_shr() is available and despite the increased
computational complexity (compared to 64bit) TSC page is still a huge win
compared to MSR-based clocksource.

In-kernel reads:
  MSR based clocksource: 3361 cycles
  TSC page clocksource: 49 cycles

Reads from userspace (utilizing vDSO in case of TSC page):
  MSR based clocksource: 5664 cycles
  TSC page clocksource: 131 cycles

Enabling TSC page on 32bits allows to get rid of CONFIG_HYPERV_TSCPAGE as
it is now not any different from CONFIG_HYPERV_TIMER.
