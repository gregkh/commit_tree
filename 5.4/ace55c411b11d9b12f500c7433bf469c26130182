spi: npcm-fiu: add NPCM FIU controller driver

Add Nuvoton NPCM BMC Flash Interface Unit(FIU) SPI master
controller driver using SPI-MEM interface.

The FIU supports single, dual or quad communication interface.

the FIU controller can operate in following modes:
- User Mode Access(UMA): provides flash access by using an
  indirect address/data mechanism.
- direct rd/wr mode: maps the flash memory into the core
  address space.
- SPI-X mode: used for an expansion bus to an ASIC or CPLD.
