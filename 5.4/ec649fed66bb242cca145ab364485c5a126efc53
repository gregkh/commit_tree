nl80211: Disallow setting of HT for channel 14

This patch disables setting of HT20 and more for channel 14 because
the channel is only for IEEE 802.11b.

The patch for net/wireless/util.c was unit-tested.

The patch for net/wireless/chan.c was tested with iw command.

Before this patch.
$ sudo iw dev <ifname> set channel 14 HT20
$

After this patch.
$ sudo iw dev <ifname> set channel 14 HT20
kernel reports: invalid channel definition
command failed: Invalid argument (-22)
$
