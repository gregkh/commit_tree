perf trace: Forward error codes when trying to read syscall info

We iterate thru the syscall table produced from the kernel syscall
tables reading info, propagate the error and add to the debug message.

This helps in fixing further bugs, such as failing to read the
"sendfile" syscall info when it really should try the aliasm
"sendfile64".

  Problems reading syscall 40: 2 (No such file or directory)(sendfile) information

  # grep sendfile /tmp/build/perf/arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.c
	[40] = "sendfile",
  #

I.e. in the tracefs format file for the syscall tracepoints we have it
as sendfile64:

  # find /sys -type f -name format | grep sendfile
  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_enter_sendfile64/format
  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_exit_sendfile64/format
  #

But as "sendfile" in the file used to build the syscall table used in
perf:

  $ grep sendfile arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
  40	common	sendfile		__x64_sys_sendfile64
  $

So we need to add, in followup patches, aliases in 'perf trace' syscall
data structures to cope with thie.
