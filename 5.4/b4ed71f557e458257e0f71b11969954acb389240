mm: treewide: clarify pgtable_page_{ctor,dtor}() naming

The naming of pgtable_page_{ctor,dtor}() seems to have confused a few
people, and until recently arm64 used these erroneously/pointlessly for
other levels of page table.

To make it incredibly clear that these only apply to the PTE level, and to
align with the naming of pgtable_pmd_page_{ctor,dtor}(), let's rename them
to pgtable_pte_page_{ctor,dtor}().

These changes were generated with the following shell script:

----
git grep -lw 'pgtable_page_.tor' | while read FILE; do
    sed -i '{s/pgtable_page_ctor/pgtable_pte_page_ctor/}' $FILE;
    sed -i '{s/pgtable_page_dtor/pgtable_pte_page_dtor/}' $FILE;
done
----

... with the documentation re-flowed to remain under 80 columns, and
whitespace fixed up in macros to keep backslashes aligned.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
