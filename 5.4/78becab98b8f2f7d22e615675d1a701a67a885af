vfio/spapr_tce: Fix incorrect tce_iommu_group memory free

The @tcegrp variable is used in 1) a loop over attached groups
2) it stores a pointer to a newly allocated tce_iommu_group if 1) found
nothing. However the error handler does not distinguish how we got there
and incorrectly releases memory for a found+incompatible group.

This fixes it by adding another error handling case.
