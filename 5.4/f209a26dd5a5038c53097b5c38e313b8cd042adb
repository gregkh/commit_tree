KVM: x86: Don't check kvm_rebooting in __kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot()

Remove the kvm_rebooting check from VMX/SVM instruction exception fixup
now that kvm_spurious_fault() conditions its BUG() on !kvm_rebooting.
Because the 'cleanup_insn' functionally is also gone, deferring to
kvm_spurious_fault() means __kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() can eliminate
its .fixup code entirely and have its exception table entry branch
directly to the call to kvm_spurious_fault().
