iwlwifi: pcie: change qu with jf devices to use qu configuration

There were a bunch of devices with qu and jf that were loading the
configuration with pu and jf, which is wrong.  Fix them all
accordingly.  Additionally, remove 0x1010 and 0x1210 subsytem IDs from
the list, since they are obviously wrong, and 0x0044 and 0x0244, which
were duplicate.
