arm64: dts: add support for SM1 based SEI Robotics SEI610

Add support for the Amlogic SM1 Based SEI610 board.

The SM1 SoC is a derivative of the G12A SoC Family with :
- Cortex-A55 core instead of A53
- more power domains, including USB & PCIe
- a neural network co-processor (NNA)
- a CSI input and image processor
- some changes in the audio complex, thus not yet enabled

The SEI610 board is a derivative of the SEI510 board with :
- removed ADC based touch button, replaced with 3x GPIO buttons
- physical switch disabling on-board MICs
- USB-C port for USB 2.0 OTG
- On-board FTDI USB2SERIAL port for Linux console

Audio, Display and USB support will be added later when support of the
corresponding power domains will be added, for now they are kept disabled.
