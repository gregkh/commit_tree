libperf: Add perf_mmap struct

Add the perf_mmap struct to libperf.

The definition is added into:

  include/internal/mmap.h

which is not to be included by users, but shared within perf and
libperf.

Committer notes:

Remove unnecessary includes from tools/perf/lib/include/internal/mmap.h,
those will be readded as they become necessary, later in the series.
