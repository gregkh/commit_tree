tools: bpftool: add feature check for zlib

bpftool requires libelf, and zlib for decompressing /proc/config.gz.
zlib is a transitive dependency via libelf, and became mandatory since
elfutils 0.165 (Jan 2016). The feature check of libelf is already done
in the elfdep target of tools/lib/bpf/Makefile, pulled in by bpftool via
a dependency on libbpf.a. Add a similar feature check for zlib.
