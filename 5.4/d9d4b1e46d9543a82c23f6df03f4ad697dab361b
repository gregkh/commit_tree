HID: Fix assumption that devices have inputs

The syzbot fuzzer found a slab-out-of-bounds write bug in the hid-gaff
driver.  The problem is caused by the driver's assumption that the
device must have an input report.  While this will be true for all
normal HID input devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the
assumption.

The same assumption is present in over a dozen other HID drivers.
This patch fixes them by checking that the list of hid_inputs for the
hid_device is nonempty before allowing it to be used.
