perf tools: tools/include should come before tools/uapi/include

The next cset will grap const.h copies from the kernel to keep bits.h
in sync as it started to use linux/const.h, that in turn includes
uapi/linux/const.h.

So now we have a file with the same name in tools/include and
tools/uapi/include, and one includes the other, we need to have
tools/include/uapi/ after tools/include/ for this to work, fix it.
