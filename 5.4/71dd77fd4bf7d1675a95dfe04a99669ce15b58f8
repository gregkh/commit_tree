libbpf: use LFS (_FILE_OFFSET_BITS) instead of direct mmap2 syscall

Drop __NR_mmap2 fork in flavor of LFS, that is _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
(glibc & bionic) / LARGEFILE64_SOURCE (for musl) decision. It allows
mmap() to use 64bit offset that is passed to mmap2 syscall. As result
pgoff is not truncated and no need to use direct access to mmap2 for
32 bits systems.
