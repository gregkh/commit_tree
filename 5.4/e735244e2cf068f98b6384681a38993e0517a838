gpiolib: don't clear FLAG_IS_OUT when emulating open-drain/open-source

When emulating open-drain/open-source by not actively driving the output
lines - we're simply changing their mode to input. This is wrong as it
will then make it impossible to change the value of such line - it's now
considered to actually be in input mode. If we want to still use the
direction_input() callback for simplicity then we need to set FLAG_IS_OUT
manually in gpiod_direction_output() and not clear it in
gpio_set_open_drain_value_commit() and
gpio_set_open_source_value_commit().
