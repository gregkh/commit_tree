USB: Disable USB2 LPM at shutdown

The QCA Rome USB Bluetooth controller has several issues once LPM gets
enabled:
- Fails to get enumerated in coldboot. [1]
- Drains more power (~ 0.2W) when the system is in S5. [2]
- Disappears after a warmboot. [2]

The issue happens because the device lingers at LPM L1 in S5, so device
can't get enumerated even after a reboot.

Disable LPM at shutdown to solve the issue.
