media: vivid: fix potential integer overflow on left shift

There is a potential integer overflow when int 2 is left shifted
as this is evaluated using 32 bit arithmetic but is being used in
a context that expects an expression of type s64.  Fix this by
generating a mask using GENMASK to avoid a 32 bit overflow.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unintentional integer overflow")
