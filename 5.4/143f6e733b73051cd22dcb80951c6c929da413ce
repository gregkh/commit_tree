md/raid6: Set R5_ReadError when there is read failure on parity disk

7471fb77ce4d ("md/raid6: Fix anomily when recovering a single device in
RAID6.") avoids rereading P when it can be computed from other members.
However, this misses the chance to re-write the right data to P. This
patch sets R5_ReadError if the re-read fails.

Also, when re-read is skipped, we also missed the chance to reset
rdev->read_errors to 0. It can fail the disk when there are many read
errors on P member disk (other disks don't have read error)

V2: upper layer read request don't read parity/Q data. So there is no
need to consider such situation.
