KVM: x86: Move #GP injection for VMware into x86_emulate_instruction()

Immediately inject a #GP when VMware emulation fails and return
EMULATE_DONE instead of propagating EMULATE_FAIL up the stack.  This
helps pave the way for removing EMULATE_FAIL altogether.

Rename EMULTYPE_VMWARE to EMULTYPE_VMWARE_GP to document that the x86
emulator is called to handle VMware #GP interception, e.g. why a #GP
is injected on emulation failure for EMULTYPE_VMWARE_GP.

Drop EMULTYPE_NO_UD_ON_FAIL as a standalone type.  The "no #UD on fail"
is used only in the VMWare case and is obsoleted by having the emulator
itself reinject #GP.
