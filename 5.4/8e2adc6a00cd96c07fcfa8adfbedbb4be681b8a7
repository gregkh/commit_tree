export: allow definition default namespaces in Makefiles or sources

To avoid excessive usage of EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS(sym, MY_NAMESPACE), where
MY_NAMESPACE will always be the namespace we are exporting to, allow
exporting all definitions of EXPORT_SYMBOL() and friends by defining
DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE.

For example, to export all symbols defined in usb-common into the
namespace USB_COMMON, add a line like this to drivers/usb/common/Makefile:

  ccflags-y += -DDEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE=USB_COMMON

That is equivalent to changing all EXPORT_SYMBOL(sym) definitions to
EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS(sym, USB_COMMON). Subsequently all symbol namespaces
functionality will apply.

Another way of making use of this feature is to define the namespace
within source or header files similar to how TRACE_SYSTEM defines are
used:
  #undef DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE
  #define DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE USB_COMMON

Please note that, as opposed to TRACE_SYSTEM, DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE
has to be defined before including include/linux/export.h.

If DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE is defined, a symbol can still be exported
to another namespace by using EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS() and friends with
explicitly specifying the namespace.
