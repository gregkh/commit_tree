gpiolib: of: add a fallback for wlf,reset GPIO name

The old Arizona binding did not use -gpio or -gpios suffix, so
devm_gpiod_get() does not work for it. As it is the one of a few users
of devm_gpiod_get_from_of_node() API that I want to remove, I'd rather
have a small quirk in the gpiolib OF handler, and switch Arizona
driver to devm_gpiod_get().
