RDMA/odp: Use the common interval tree library instead of generic

ODP is working with userspace VA's in the interval tree which always fit
into an unsigned long, so we can use the common code.

This comes at a cost of a 16 byte increase in ib_umem_odp struct size due
to storing the interval tree start/last in addition to the umem
addr/length. However these values were computed and are performance
critical for the interval lookup, so this seems like a worthwhile trade
off.

Removes 2k of .text from the kernel.
