drm/vkms: No need for ->pages_lock in crc work anymore

We're now guaranteed to no longer race against prepare_fb/cleanup_fb,
which means we can access ->vaddr without having to hold a lock.

Before the previous patches it was fairly easy to observe the cursor
->vaddr being invalid, but that's now gone, so we can upgrade to a
full WARN_ON.
