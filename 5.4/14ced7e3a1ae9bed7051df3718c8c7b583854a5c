phy: qcom-qmp: Correct ready status, again

Despite extensive testing of commit 885bd765963b ("phy: qcom-qmp: Correct
READY_STATUS poll break condition") I failed to conclude that the
PHYSTATUS bit of the PCS_STATUS register used in PCIe and USB3 falls as
the PHY gets ready. Similar to the prior bug with UFS the code will
generally get past the check before the transition and thereby
"succeed".

Correct the name of the register used PCIe and USB3 PHYs, replace
mask_pcs_ready with a constant expression depending on the type of the
PHY and check for the appropriate ready state.
