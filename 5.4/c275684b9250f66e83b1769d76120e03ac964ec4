ice: Move VF resources definition to SR-IOV specific file

In order to use some of the VF resources definition in the SR-IOV specific
virtchnl header file, this patch moves applicable code to
ice_virtchnl_pf.h file accordingly... and they should have been defined in
the destination file originally.
