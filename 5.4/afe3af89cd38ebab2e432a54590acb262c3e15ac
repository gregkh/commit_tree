ARM: dts: stm32: remove OV5640 pinctrl definition on stm32mp157c-ev1

"push-pull" configuration is now fully handled by the gpiolib and the
STMFX pinctrl driver. There is no longer need to declare a pinctrl group
to only configure "push-pull" setting for the line. It is done directly by
the gpiolib.
