vfs: subtype handling moved to fuse

The unused vfs code can be removed.  Don't pass empty subtype (same as if
->parse callback isn't called).

The bits that are left involve determining whether it's permitted to split the
filesystem type string passed in to mount(2).  Consequently, this means that we
cannot get rid of the FS_HAS_SUBTYPE flag unless we define that a type string
with a dot in it always indicates a subtype specification.
