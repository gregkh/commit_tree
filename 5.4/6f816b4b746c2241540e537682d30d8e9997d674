blk-mq: add optional request->alloc_time_ns

There are currently two start time timestamps - start_time_ns and
io_start_time_ns.  The former marks the request allocation and and the
second issue-to-device time.  The planned io.weight controller needs
to measure the total time bios take to execute after it leaves rq_qos
including the time spent waiting for request to become available,
which can easily dominate on saturated devices.

This patch adds request->alloc_time_ns which records when the request
allocation attempt started.  As it isn't used for the usual stats,
make it optional behind CONFIG_BLK_RQ_ALLOC_TIME and
QUEUE_FLAG_RQ_ALLOC_TIME so that it can be compiled out when there are
no users and it's active only on queues which need it even when
compiled in.

v2: s/pre_start_time/alloc_time/ and add CONFIG_BLK_RQ_ALLOC_TIME
    gating as suggested by Jens.
