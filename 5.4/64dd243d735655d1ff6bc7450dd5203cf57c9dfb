platform/x86: surfacepro3_button: Fix device check

Do not use the surfacepro3_button driver on newer Microsoft Surface
models, only use it on the Surface Pro 3 and 4. Newer models (5th, 6th
and possibly future generations) use the same device as the Surface Pro
4 to represent their volume and power buttons (MSHW0040), but their
actual implementation is significantly different. This patch ensures
that the surfacepro3_button driver is only used on the Pro 3 and 4
models, allowing a different driver to bind on other models.
