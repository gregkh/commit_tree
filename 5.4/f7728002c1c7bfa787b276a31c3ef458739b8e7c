virtio_ring: fix return code on DMA mapping fails

Commit 780bc7903a32 ("virtio_ring: Support DMA APIs")  makes
virtqueue_add() return -EIO when we fail to map our I/O buffers. This is
a very realistic scenario for guests with encrypted memory, as swiotlb
may run out of space, depending on it's size and the I/O load.

The virtio-blk driver interprets -EIO form virtqueue_add() as an IO
error, despite the fact that swiotlb full is in absence of bugs a
recoverable condition.

Let us change the return code to -ENOMEM, and make the block layer
recover form these failures when virtio-blk encounters the condition
described above.
