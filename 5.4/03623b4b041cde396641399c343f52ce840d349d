rtc: pcf2127: add tamper detection support

Add support for integrated tamper detection function in both PCF2127 and
PCF2129 chips. This patch implements the feature by adding an additional
timestamp0 file to sysfs device path. This file contains seconds since
epoch, if an event occurred, or is empty, if none occurred.
Interface should match ISL1208 and RV3028 RTC drivers.
