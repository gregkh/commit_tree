net: dsa: Pass ndo_setup_tc slave callback to drivers

DSA currently handles shared block filters (for the classifier-action
qdisc) in the core due to what I believe are simply pragmatic reasons -
hiding the complexity from drivers and offerring a simple API for port
mirroring.

Extend the dsa_slave_setup_tc function by passing all other qdisc
offloads to the driver layer, where the driver may choose what it
implements and how. DSA is simply a pass-through in this case.
