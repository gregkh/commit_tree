lib: Remove redundant ftrace flag removal

Since architectures can implement ftrace using a variety of mechanisms,
generic code should always use CC_FLAGS_FTRACE rather than assuming that
ftrace is built using -pg.

Since commit:

  2464a609ded09420 ("ftrace: do not trace library functions")

... lib/Makefile has removed CC_FLAGS_FTRACE from KBUILD_CFLAGS, so ftrace is
disabled for all files under lib/.

Given that, we shouldn't explicitly remove -pg when building
lib/string.o, as this is redundant and bad form.

Clean things up accordingly.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
