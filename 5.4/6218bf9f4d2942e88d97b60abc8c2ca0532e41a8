tracing/probe: Add immediate parameter support

Add immediate value parameter (\1234) support to
probe events. This allows you to specify an immediate
(or dummy) parameter instead of fetching from memory
or register.

This feature looks odd, but imagine when you put a probe
on a code to trace some data. If the code is compiled into
2 instructions and 1 instruction has a value but other has
nothing since it is optimized out.
In that case, you can not fold those into one event, even
if ftrace supported multiple probes on one event.
With this feature, you can set a dummy value like
foo=\deadbeef instead of something like foo=%di.
