drm/amd/display: do not synchronize "drr" displays

[why]
A display that supports DRR can never really be considered
"synchronized" with any other display because we can dynamically
enable DRR (i.e. without modeset).  this will cause their
relative CRTC positions to drift and lose sync.  this will disrupt
features such as MCLK switching that assume and depend on
their permanent alignment (that can only change with modeset)

[how]
check for ignore_msa in stream when considered synchronizability
this ignore_msa is basically actually implemented as "supports drr"
