bnxt_en: Add FW fatal devlink_health_reporter.

Health show command example and output:

$ devlink health show pci/0000:af:00.0 reporter fw_fatal

pci/0000:af:00.0:
  name fw_fatal
    state healthy error 1 recover 1 grace_period 0 auto_recover true

Fatal events from firmware or missing periodic heartbeats will
be reported and recovery will be handled.

We also turn on the support flags when we register with the firmware to
enable this health and recovery feature in the firmware.
