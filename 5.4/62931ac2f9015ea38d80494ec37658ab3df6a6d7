i2c: mt65xx: fix NULL ptr dereference

Since commit abf4923e97c3 ("i2c: mediatek: disable zero-length transfers
for mt8183"), there is a NULL pointer dereference for all the SoCs
that don't have any quirk. mtk_i2c_functionality is not checking that
the quirks pointer is not NULL before starting to use it.

This commit add a call to i2c_check_quirks which will check whether
the quirks pointer is set, and if so will check if the IP has the
NO_ZERO_LEN quirk.
