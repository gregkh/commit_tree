udf: support 2048-byte spacing of VRS descriptors on 4K media

Some UDF creators (specifically Microsoft, but perhaps others) mishandle
the ECMA-167 corner case that requires descriptors within a Volume
Recognition Sequence to be placed at 4096-byte intervals on media where
the block size is 4K. Instead, the descriptors are placed at the 2048-
byte interval mandated for media with smaller blocks. This nonconformity
currently prevents Linux from recognizing the filesystem as UDF.

Modify the driver to tolerate a misformatted VRS on 4K media.
