arm64: vdso32: Fix broken compat vDSO build warnings

The .config file and the generated include/config/auto.conf can
end up out of sync after a set of commands since
CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO is not updated correctly.

The sequence can be reproduced as follows:

$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- defconfig
[...]
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig
[set CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO="arm-linux-gnueabihf-"]
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

Which results in:

arch/arm64/Makefile:62: CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT not defined or empty,
the compat vDSO will not be built

even though the compat vDSO has been built:

$ file arch/arm64/kernel/vdso32/vdso.so
arch/arm64/kernel/vdso32/vdso.so: ELF 32-bit LSB pie executable, ARM,
EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked,
BuildID[sha1]=c67f6c786f2d2d6f86c71f708595594aa25247f6, stripped

A similar case that involves changing the configuration parameter
multiple times can be reconducted to the same family of problems.

Remove the use of CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO altogether and
instead rely on the cross-compiler prefix coming from the environment
via CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT, much like we do for the rest of the kernel.
