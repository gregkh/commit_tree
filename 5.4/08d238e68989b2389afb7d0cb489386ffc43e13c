drm/amd/display: Clock does not lower in Updateplanes

[why]
We reset the optimized_required in atomic_plane_disable
flag immediately after it is set in atomic_plane_disconnect, causing us to
never have flag set during next flip in UpdatePlanes.

[how]
Optimize directly after each time plane is removed.
