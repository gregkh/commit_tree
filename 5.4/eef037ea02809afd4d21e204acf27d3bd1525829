drm/i915/ehl: Add support for DPLL4 (v10)

This patch adds support for DPLL4 on EHL that include the
following restrictions:

- DPLL4 cannot be used with DDIA (combo port A internal eDP usage).
  DPLL4 can be used with other DDIs, including DDID
  (combo port A external usage).

- DPLL4 cannot be enabled when DC5 or DC6 are enabled.

- The DPLL4 enable, lock, power enabled, and power state are connected
  to the MGPLL1_ENABLE register.

v2: (suggestions from Bob Paauwe)
- Rework ehl_get_dpll() function to call intel_find_shared_dpll() and
  iterate twice: once for Combo plls and once for MG plls.

- Use MG pll funcs for DPLL4 instead of creating new ones and modify
  mg_pll_enable to include the restrictions for EHL.

v3: Fix compilation error

v4: (suggestions from Lucas and Ville)
- Treat DPLL4 as a combo phy PLL and not as MG PLL
- Disable DC states when this DPLL is being enabled
- Reuse icl_get_dpll instead of creating a separate one for EHL

v5: (suggestion from Ville)
- Refcount the DC OFF power domains during the enabling and disabling
  of this DPLL.

v6: rebase

v7: (suggestion from Imre)
- Add a new power domain instead of iterating over the domains
  assoicated with DC OFF power well.

v8: (Ville and Imre)
- Rename POWER_DOMAIN_DPLL4 TO POWER_DOMAIN_DPLL_DC_OFF
- Grab a reference in intel_modeset_setup_hw_state() if this
  DPLL was already enabled perhaps by BIOS.
- Check for the port type instead of the encoder

v9: (Ville)
- Move the block of code that grabs a reference to the power domain
  POWER_DOMAIN_DPLL_DC_OFF to intel_modeset_readout_hw_state() to ensure
  that there is a reference present before this DPLL might get disabled.

v10: rebase
