SUNRPC: Track writers of the 'channel' file to improve cache_listeners_exist

The sunrpc cache interface is susceptible to being fooled by a rogue
process just reading a 'channel' file.  If this happens the kernel
may think a valid daemon exists to service the cache when it does not.
For example, the following may fool the kernel:
cat /proc/net/rpc/auth.unix.gid/channel

Change the tracking of readers to writers when considering whether a
listener exists as all valid daemon processes either open a channel
file O_RDWR or O_WRONLY.  While this does not prevent a rogue process
from "stealing" a message from the kernel, it does at least improve
the kernels perception of whether a valid process servicing the cache
exists.
