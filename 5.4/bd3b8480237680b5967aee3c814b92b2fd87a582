Input: goodix - add support for 9-bytes reports

Some variants of Goodix touchscreen firmwares use 9-bytes finger
report format instead of common 8-bytes format.

This report format may be present as:

struct goodix_contact_data {
        uint8_t unknown1;
        uint8_t track_id;
        uint8_t unknown2;
        uint16_t x;
        uint16_t y;
        uint16_t w;
}__attribute__((packed));

Add support for such format and use it for Lenovo Yoga Book notebook
(which uses a Goodix touchpad as a touch keyboard).
