clone3: switch to copy_struct_from_user()

Switch clone3() syscall from it's own copying struct clone_args from
userspace to the new dedicated copy_struct_from_user() helper.

The change is very straightforward, and helps unify the syscall
interface for struct-from-userspace syscalls. Additionally, explicitly
define CLONE_ARGS_SIZE_VER0 to match the other users of the
struct-extension pattern.
