drm/i915: Allow sharing the idle-barrier from other kernel requests

By placing our idle-barriers in the i915_active fence tree, we expose
those for reuse by other components that are issuing requests along the
kernel_context. Reusing the proto-barrier active_node is perfectly fine
as the new request implies a context-switch, and so an opportune point
to run the idle-barrier. However, the proto-barrier is not equivalent
to a normal active_node and care must be taken to avoid dereferencing the
ERR_PTR used as its request marker.

v2: Comment the more egregious cheek
v3: A glossary!
