scsi: lpfc: Fix driver nvme rescan logging

In situations where zoning is not being used, thus NVMe initiators see
other NVMe initiators as well as NVMe targets, a link bounce on an
initiator will cause the NVMe initiators to spew "6169" State Error
messages.

The driver is not qualifying whether the remote port is a NVMe targer or
not before calling the lpfc_nvme_rescan_port(), which validates the role
and prints the message if its only an NVMe initiator.

Fix by the following:

 - Before calling lpfc_nvme_rescan_port() ensure that the node is a NVMe
   storage target or a NVMe discovery controller.

 - Clean up implementation of lpfc_nvme_rescan_port. remoteport pointer
   will always be NULL if a NVMe initiator only. But, grabbing of
   remoteport pointer should be done under lock to coincide with the
   registering of the remote port with the fc transport.
