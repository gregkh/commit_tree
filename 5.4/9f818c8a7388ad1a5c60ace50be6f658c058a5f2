mlx5: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

This cleans up a lot of unneeded code and logic around the debugfs
files, making all of this much simpler and easier to understand as we
don't need to keep the dentries saved anymore.
