dmaengine: tegra-apb: Support per-burst residue granularity

Tegra's APB DMA engine updates words counter after each transferred burst
of data, hence it can report transfer's residual with more fidelity which
may be required in cases like audio playback. In particular this fixes
audio stuttering during playback in a chromium web browser. The patch is
based on the original work that was made by Ben Dooks and a patch from
downstream kernel. It was tested on Tegra20 and Tegra30 devices.
