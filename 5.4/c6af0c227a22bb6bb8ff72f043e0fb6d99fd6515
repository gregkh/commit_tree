ip: support SO_MARK cmsg

Enable setting skb->mark for UDP and RAW sockets using cmsg.

This is analogous to existing support for TOS, TTL, txtime, etc.

Packet sockets already support this as of commit c7d39e32632e
("packet: support per-packet fwmark for af_packet sendmsg").

Similar to other fields, implement by
1. initialize the sockcm_cookie.mark from socket option sk_mark
2. optionally overwrite this in ip_cmsg_send/ip6_datagram_send_ctl
3. initialize inet_cork.mark from sockcm_cookie.mark
4. initialize each (usually just one) skb->mark from inet_cork.mark

Step 1 is handled in one location for most protocols by ipcm_init_sk
as of commit 351782067b6b ("ipv4: ipcm_cookie initializers").
