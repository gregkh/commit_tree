drm/sun4i: sun8i-csc: Add support for color encoding and range

Conversion from YUV to RGB depends on range (limited or full) and
encoding (BT.601 or BT.709). Current code doesn't consider this and
always uses BT.601 encoding and limited range.

Fix this by introducing new CSC matrices, which are selected based on
range and encoding parameters.
