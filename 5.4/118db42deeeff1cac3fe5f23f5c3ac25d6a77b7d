crypto: inside-secure - Add EIP97/EIP197 and endianness detection

This patch adds automatic EIP97/EIP197 detection, so it does not need to
rely on any static value from the device table anymore. In particular,
the static value from the table won't work for PCI devboards that cannot
be further identified save from this direct hardware probing.

The patch also adds automatic host xs endianness detection & correction.
