irqchip/mmp: Mask off interrupts from other cores

On mmp3, there's an extra set of ICU registers (ICU2) that handle
interrupts on the extra cores.  When masking off interrupts on MP1,
these should be masked as well.

We add a new interrupt controller via device tree to identify when we're
looking at an mmp3 machine via compatible field of "marvell,mmp3-intc".

[lkundrak@v3.sk: Changed "mrvl,mmp3-intc" compatible strings to
"marvell,mmp3-intc". Tidied up the subject line a bit.]

Changes since v1:
- Moved mmp3-specific mmp_icu2_base initialization from mmp_init_bases() to
  mmp3_of_init() so that we don't have to check for marvell,mmp3-intc
  compatibility twice.
- Drop an superfluous call to irq_set_default_host()
