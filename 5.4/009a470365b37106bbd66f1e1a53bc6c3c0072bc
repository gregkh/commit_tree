ravb: remove undocumented counter processing

This patch removes the use of the undocumented counter registers
CDCR, LCCR, CERCR, CEECR.

Offsets used for undocumented registers are considered reserved and
should not be written to. After some internal investigation with Renesas
it remains unclear why this driver accesses these fields but regardless of
what the historical reasons are the current code is considered incorrect.
