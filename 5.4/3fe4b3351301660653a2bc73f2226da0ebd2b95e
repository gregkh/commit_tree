cdc_ncm: fix divide-by-zero caused by invalid wMaxPacketSize

Endpoints with zero wMaxPacketSize are not usable for transferring
data. Ignore such endpoints when looking for valid in, out and
status pipes, to make the driver more robust against invalid and
meaningless descriptors.

The wMaxPacketSize of the out pipe is used as divisor. So this change
fixes a divide-by-zero bug.
