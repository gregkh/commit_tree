drm/i915: Remove unneeded disconnect in TypeC legacy port mode

Disconnecting the TypeC PHY when the port is in legacy mode is not
necessary:
- BSpec doesn't specify a disconnect sequence for legacy mode.
- The use of the PHY is dedicated for the display in legacy mode.
- We keep the PHY always connected during runtime as well in legacy
  mode.

We disconnect the PHY when needed during a disabling modeset for the
port, so we can also remove the disconnect call from the destroy hook.
