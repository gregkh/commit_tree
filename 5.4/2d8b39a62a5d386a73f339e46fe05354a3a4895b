ACPI: processor: Avoid NULL pointer dereferences at init time

If there are neither processor objects nor processor device objects
in the ACPI tables, the per-CPU processors table will not be
initialized and attempting to dereference pointers from there will
cause the kernel to crash.  This happens in acpi_processor_ppc_init()
and acpi_thermal_cpufreq_init() after commit d15ce412737a ("ACPI:
cpufreq: Switch to QoS requests instead of cpufreq notifier")
which didn't add the requisite NULL pointer checks in there.

Add the NULL pointer checks to acpi_processor_ppc_init() and
acpi_thermal_cpufreq_init(), and to the corresponding "exit"
routines.

While at it, drop redundant return instructions from
acpi_processor_ppc_init() and acpi_thermal_cpufreq_init().
