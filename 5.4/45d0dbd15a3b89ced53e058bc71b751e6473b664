drm/panfrost: Remove unnecessary hwaccess_lock spin_lock

With the introduction of the as_lock to serialize address space registers,
the hwaccess_lock is only used within the job code and is not protecting
anything. panfrost_job_hw_submit() only accesses registers for 1 job slot
and it's already serialized by drm_sched.
