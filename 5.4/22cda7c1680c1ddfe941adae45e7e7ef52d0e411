powerpc/eeh: Add debugfs interface to run an EEH check

Detecting an frozen EEH PE usually occurs when an MMIO load returns a 0xFFs
response. When performing EEH testing using the EEH error injection feature
available on some platforms there is no simple way to kick-off the kernel's
recovery process since any accesses from userspace (usually /dev/mem) will
bypass the MMIO helpers in the kernel which check if a 0xFF response is due
to an EEH freeze or not.

If a device contains a 0xFF byte in it's config space it's possible to
trigger the recovery process via config space read from userspace, but this
is not a reliable method. If a driver is bound to the device an in use it
will frequently trigger the MMIO check, but this is also inconsistent.

To solve these problems this patch adds a debugfs file called
"eeh_dev_check" which accepts a <domain>:<bus>:<dev>.<fn> string and runs
eeh_dev_check_failure() on it. This is the same check that's done when the
kernel gets a 0xFF result from an config or MMIO read with the added
benifit that it can be reliably triggered from userspace.
