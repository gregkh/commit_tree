nvme-fabrics: allow discovery subsystems accept a kato

This modifies the behavior of discovery subsystems to accept
a kato as a preparation to support discovery log change
events. This also means that now every discovery controller
will have a default kato value, and for non-persistent connections
the host needs to pass in a zero kato value (keep_alive_tmo=0).
