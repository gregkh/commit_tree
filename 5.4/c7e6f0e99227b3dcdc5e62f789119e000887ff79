csky: Support kernel non-aligned access

We prohibit non-aligned access in kernel mode, but some special NIC
driver needs to support kernel-state unaligned access. For example,
when the bus does not support unaligned access, IP header parsing
will cause non-aligned access and driver does not recopy the skb
buffer to dma for performance reasons.

Added kernel_enable & user_enable to control unaligned access and
added kernel_count  & user_count for statistical unaligned access.
