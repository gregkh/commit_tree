hrtimer: Add a missing bracket and hide `migration_base' on !SMP

The recent change to avoid taking the expiry lock when a timer is currently
migrated missed to add a bracket at the end of the if statement leading to
compile errors.  Since that commit the variable `migration_base' is always
used but it is only available on SMP configuration thus leading to another
compile error.  The changelog says "The timer base and base->cpu_base
cannot be NULL in the code path", so it is safe to limit this check to SMP
configurations only.

Add the missing bracket to the if statement and hide `migration_base'
behind CONFIG_SMP bars.

[ tglx: Mark the functions inline ... ]
