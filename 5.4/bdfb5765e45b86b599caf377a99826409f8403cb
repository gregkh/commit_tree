can: af_can: remove NULL-ptr checks from users of can_dev_rcv_lists_find()

Since using the "struct can_ml_priv" for the per device "struct
dev_rcv_lists" the call can_dev_rcv_lists_find() cannot fail anymore.
This patch simplifies af_can by removing the NULL pointer checks from
the dev_rcv_lists returned by can_dev_rcv_lists_find().
