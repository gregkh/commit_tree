net/smc: keep vlan_id for SMC-R in smc_listen_work()

Creating of an SMC-R connection with vlan-id fails, because
smc_listen_work() determines the vlan_id of the connection,
saves it in struct smc_init_info ini, but clears the ini area
again if SMC-D is not applicable.
This patch just resets the ISM device before investigating
SMC-R availability.
