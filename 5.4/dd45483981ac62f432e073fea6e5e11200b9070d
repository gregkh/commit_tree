s390/dasd: Fix error handling during online processing

It is possible that the CCW commands for reading volume and extent pool
information are not supported, either by the storage server (for
dedicated DASDs) or by z/VM (for virtual devices, such as MDISKs).

As a command reject will occur in such a case, the current error
handling leads to a failing online processing and thus the DASD can't be
used at all.

Since the data being read is not essential for an fully operational
DASD, the error handling can be removed. Information about the failing
command is sent to the s390dbf debug feature.
