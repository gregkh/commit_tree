clk: imx: imx8mn: fix audio pll setting

The AUDIO PLL max support 650M, so the original clk settings violate
spec. This patch makes the output 786432000 -> 393216000,
and 722534400 -> 361267200 to aligned with NXP vendor kernel without any
impact on audio functionality and go within 650MHz PLL limit.
