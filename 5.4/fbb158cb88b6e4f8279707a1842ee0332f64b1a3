KVM: x86/mmu: Revert "Revert "KVM: MMU: zap pages in batch""

Now that the fast invalidate mechanism has been reintroduced, restore
the performance tweaks for fast invalidation that existed prior to its
removal.

Paraphrashing the original changelog:

  Zap at least 10 shadow pages before releasing mmu_lock to reduce the
  overhead associated with re-acquiring the lock.

  Note: "10" is an arbitrary number, speculated to be high enough so
  that a vCPU isn't stuck zapping obsolete pages for an extended period,
  but small enough so that other vCPUs aren't starved waiting for
  mmu_lock.

This reverts commit 43d2b14b105fb00b8864c7b0ee7043cc1cc4a969.
