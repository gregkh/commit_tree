xfs: assure zeroed memory buffers for certain kmem allocations

Guarantee zeroed memory buffers for cases where potential memory
leak to disk can occur. In these cases, kmem_alloc is used and
doesn't zero the buffer, opening the possibility of information
leakage to disk.

Use existing infrastucture (xfs_buf_allocate_memory) to obtain
the already zeroed buffer from kernel memory.

This solution avoids the performance issue that would occur if a
wholesale change to replace kmem_alloc with kmem_zalloc was done.
