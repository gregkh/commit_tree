leds: class: Improve LED and LED flash class registration API

Replace of_led_classdev_register() with led_classdev_register_ext(), which
accepts easily extendable struct led_init_data, instead of the fixed
struct device_node argument. The latter can be now passed in an fwnode
property of the struct led_init_data.

The modification is driven by the need for passing additional arguments
required for the forthcoming generic mechanism for composing LED names.
Currently the LED name is conveyed in the "name" char pointer property of
the struct led_classdev. This is redundant since LED class device name
is accessible throughout the whole LED class device life time via
associated struct device's kobj->name property.

The change will not break any existing clients since the patch alters
also existing led_classdev{_flash}_register() macro wrappers, that pass
NULL in place of init_data, which leads to using legacy name
initialization path basing on the struct led_classdev's "name" property.

Three existing users of devm_of_led_classdev_registers() are modified
to use devm_led_classdev_register(), which will not impact their
operation since they in fact didn't need to pass struct device_node on
registration from the beginning.
