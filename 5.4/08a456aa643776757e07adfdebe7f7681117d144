powerpc/powernv: Move SCOM access code into powernv platform

The powernv platform is the only one that directly accesses SCOMs.
Move the support code to platforms/powernv, and get rid of the
PPC_SCOM Kconfig option, as SCOM support is always selected when
compiling for powernv.

This also means that the Kconfig item for CONFIG_SCOM_DEBUGFS will
show up in menuconfig in the platform menu, rather than at the root,
which is a much better location.
