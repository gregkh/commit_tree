fscrypt: add ->ci_inode to fscrypt_info

Add an inode back-pointer to 'struct fscrypt_info', such that
inode->i_crypt_info->ci_inode == inode.

This will be useful for:

1. Evicting the inodes when a fscrypt key is removed, since we'll track
   the inodes using a given key by linking their fscrypt_infos together,
   rather than the inodes directly.  This avoids bloating 'struct inode'
   with a new list_head.

2. Simplifying the per-file key setup, since the inode pointer won't
   have to be passed around everywhere just in case something goes wrong
   and it's needed for fscrypt_warn().
