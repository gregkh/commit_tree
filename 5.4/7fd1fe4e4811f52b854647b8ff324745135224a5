pci-hotplug/pnv_php: Add a reset_slot() callback

When performing EEH recovery of devices in a hotplug slot we need to use
the slot driver's ->reset_slot() callback to prevent spurious hotplug
events due to spurious DLActive and PresDet change interrupts. Add a
reset_slot() callback to pnv_php so we can handle recovery of devices
in pnv_php managed slots.
