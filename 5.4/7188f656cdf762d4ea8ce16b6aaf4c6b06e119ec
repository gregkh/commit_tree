ASoC: rockchip: rockchip_max98090: Set period size to 240

From stress testing of arecord, we found that period size
greater than ~900 will bring pl330 to DYING state and
can not recover within 100 iterations.
The result is that arecord will stuck and get I/O error,
and issue can not be recovered until reboot.

This issue does not happen when period size is small.
Set constraint of period size to 240 to prevent such issue.
With the constraint, there will be no issue after 2000 iterations.

We can revert this patch once the root cause is found
in rockchip's pl330 implementation.
