ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix 2 front mics of codec 0x623

These 2 ThinkCentres installed a new realtek codec ID 0x623,
it has 2 front mics with the same location on pin 0x18 and 0x19.

Apply fixup ALC283_FIXUP_HEADSET_MIC to change 1 front mic
location to right, then pulseaudio can handle them.
One "Front Mic" and one "Mic" will be shown, and audio output works
fine.
