regulator: core: Add of_node_put() before return

Each iteration of for_each_child_of_node puts the previous node, but in
the case of a return from the middle of the loop, there is no put, thus
causing a memory leak. Hence add an of_node_put before the return in
two places.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
