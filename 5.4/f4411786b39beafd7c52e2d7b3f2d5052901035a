ARM: dts: imx6ull: Add support for PHYTEC phyBOARD-Segin with i.MX 6ULL

In addition to the PHYTEC phyCORE-i.MX 6UL the PHYTEC phyBOARD-Segin is
also available with the PHYTEC phyCORE-i.MX 6ULL. So this adds support
for this SOM and its baseboards.

It comes in a full featured option with either NAND flash or eMMC and in
a low cost option only available with NAND flash.

The hardware specs are:

 - Full featured with NAND or eMMC:
    * i.MX 6ULL Y2
    * 512MB DDR3 memory
    * 512MB NAND flash or 4GB/8GB eMMC
