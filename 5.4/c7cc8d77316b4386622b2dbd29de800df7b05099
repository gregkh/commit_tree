hexagon: drop empty and unused free_initrd_mem

hexagon never reserves or initializes initrd and the only mention of it is
the empty free_initrd_mem() function.

As we have a generic implementation of free_initrd_mem(), there is no need
to define an empty stub for the hexagon implementation and it can be
dropped.
