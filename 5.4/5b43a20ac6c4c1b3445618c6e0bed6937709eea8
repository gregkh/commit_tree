phy: marvell: phy-mvebu-cp110-comphy: Add of_node_put() before return

Each iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node puts the previous
node, but in the case of a return from the middle of the loop, there is
no put, thus causing a memory leak. Hence add an of_node_put before the
return in two places.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
