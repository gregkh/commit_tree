usb: dwc3: don't set gadget->is_otg flag

This reverts
commit 6a4290cc28be1 ("usb: dwc3: gadget: set the OTG flag in dwc3 gadget driver.")

We don't yet support any of the OTG mechanisms (HNP/SRP/ADP)
and are not setting gadget->otg_caps, so don't set gadget->is_otg
flag.

If we do then we end up publishing a OTG1.0 descriptor in
the gadget descriptor which causes device enumeration to fail
if we are connected to a host with CONFIG_USB_OTG enabled.
