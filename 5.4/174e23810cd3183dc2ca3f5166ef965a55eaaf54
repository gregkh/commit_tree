sk_buff: drop all skb extensions on free and skb scrubbing

Now that we have a 3rd extension, add a new helper that drops the
extension space and use it when we need to scrub an sk_buff.

At this time, scrubbing clears secpath and bridge netfilter data, but
retains the tc skb extension, after this patch all three get cleared.

NAPI reuse/free assumes we can only have a secpath attached to skb, but
it seems better to clear all extensions there as well.
