dt-bindings: i2c: riic: Rename bindings documentation file

Rename the bindings documentation file for RIIC controller
from i2c-riic.txt to renesas,riic.txt.

This is part of an ongoing effort to name bindings documentation files for
Renesas IP blocks consistently, in line with the compat strings they
document.
