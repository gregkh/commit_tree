KVM: vmx: fix build warnings in hv_enable_direct_tlbflush() on i386

The following was reported on i386:

  arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c: In function 'hv_enable_direct_tlbflush':
  arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:503:10: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]

pr_debugs() in this function are  more or less useless, let's just
remove them. evmcs->hv_vm_id can use 'unsigned long' instead of 'u64'.

Also, simplify the code a little bit.
