media: vivid: fix device init when no_error_inj=1 and fb disabled

Add an extra condition to add the video output control class when the
device has some hdmi outputs defined.  This is required to then always
be able to add the display present control, which is enabled when
there are some hdmi outputs.

This fixes the corner case where no_error_inj is enabled and the
device has no frame buffer but some hdmi outputs, as otherwise the
video output control class would be added anyway.  Without this fix,
the sanity checks fail in v4l2_ctrl_new() as name is NULL.
