USB: serial: ftdi_sio: add support for FT232H CBUS gpios

Enable support for cbus gpios on FT232H. The cbus configuration is
stored in two words in the EEPROM at byte-offset 0x1a with the mux
config for ACBUS5, ACBUS6, ACBUS8 and ACBUS9 (only pins that can be
configured as I/O mode).

Tested using FT232H by configuring one ACBUS pin at a time.
