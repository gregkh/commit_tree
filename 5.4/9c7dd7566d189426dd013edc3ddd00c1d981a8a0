ice: add validation in OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES VF message

Check num_queue_pairs to avoid access to unallocated field of
vsi->tx_rings/vsi->rx_rings. Without this validation we can set
vsi->alloc_txq/vsi->alloc_rxq to value smaller than ICE_MAX_BASE_QS_PER_VF
and send this command with num_queue_pairs greater than
vsi->alloc_txq/vsi->alloc_rxq. This lead to access to unallocated memory.

In VF vsi alloc_txq and alloc_rxq should be the same. Get minimum
because looks more readable.

Also add validation for ring_len param. It should be greater than 32 and
be multiple of 32. Incorrect value leads to hang traffic on PF.
