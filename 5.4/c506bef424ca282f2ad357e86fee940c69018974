posix-cpu-timers: Rename thread_group_cputimer() and make it static

thread_group_cputimer() is a complete misnomer. The function does two things:

 - For arming process wide timers it makes sure that the atomic time
   storage is up to date. If no cpu timer is armed yet, then the atomic
   time storage is not updated by the scheduler for performance reasons.

   In that case a full summing up of all threads needs to be done and the
   update needs to be enabled.

- Samples the current time into the caller supplied storage.

Rename it to thread_group_start_cputime(), make it static and fixup the
callsite.
