netfilter: remove CONFIG_NETFILTER checks from headers.

`struct nf_hook_ops`, `struct nf_hook_state` and the `nf_hookfn`
function typedef appear in function and struct declarations and
definitions in a number of netfilter headers.  The structs and typedef
themselves are defined by linux/netfilter.h but only when
CONFIG_NETFILTER is enabled.  Define them unconditionally and add
forward declarations in order to remove CONFIG_NETFILTER conditionals
from the other headers.
