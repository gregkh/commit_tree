libbpf: provide more helpful message on uninitialized global var

When BPF program defines uninitialized global variable, it's put into
a special COMMON section. Libbpf will reject such programs, but will
provide very unhelpful message with garbage-looking section index.

This patch detects special section cases and gives more explicit error
message.
