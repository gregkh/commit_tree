net: ena: fix incorrect update of intr_delay_resolution

ena_dev->intr_moder_rx/tx_interval save the intervals received from the
user after dividing them by ena_dev->intr_delay_resolution. Therefore
when intr_delay_resolution changes, the code needs to first mutiply
intr_moder_rx/tx_interval by the previous intr_delay_resolution to get
the value originally given by the user, and only then divide it by the
new intr_delay_resolution.

Current code does not first multiply intr_moder_rx/tx_interval by the old
intr_delay_resolution. This commit fixes it.

Also initialize ena_dev->intr_delay_resolution to be 1.
