init/Kconfig: Fix infinite Kconfig recursion on PPC

Commit 5cf896fb6be3 ("arm64: Add support for relocating the kernel with
RELR relocations") introduced CONFIG_TOOLS_SUPPORT_RELR, which checks
for RELR support in the toolchain as part of the kernel configuration.
During this procedure, "$(NM)" is invoked to see if it supports the new
relocation format, however PowerPC conditionally overrides this variable
in the architecture Makefile in order to pass '--synthetic' when
targetting PPC64.

This conditional override causes Kconfig to recurse forever, since
CONFIG_TOOLS_SUPPORT_RELR cannot be determined without $(NM) being
defined, but that in turn depends on CONFIG_PPC64:

  $ make ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu-
  scripts/kconfig/conf  --syncconfig Kconfig
  scripts/kconfig/conf  --syncconfig Kconfig
  scripts/kconfig/conf  --syncconfig Kconfig
  [...]

In this particular case, it looks like PowerPC may be able to pass
'--synthetic' unconditionally to nm or even drop it altogether. While
that is being resolved, let's just bodge the RELR check by picking up
$(NM) directly from the environment in whatever state it happens to be
in.
