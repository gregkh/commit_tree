drm/i915/uc: Move uC early functions inside the GT ones

uC is a subcomponent of GT, so initialize/clean it as part of it. The
wopcm_init_early doesn't have to be happen before the uC one, but since
in other parts of the code we consider WOPCM first do the same for
consistency.

v2: s/cleanup_early/late_release to match the caller
v3: s/late_release/driver_late_release/ (Chris)
