um: time-travel: Fix periodic timers

Periodic timers are broken, because the also only fire once.
As it happens, Linux doesn't care because it only sets the
timer to periodic very briefly during boot, and then switches
it only between one-shot and off later.

Nevertheless, fix the logic (we shouldn't even be looking at
time_travel_timer_expiry unless the timer is enabled) and
change the code to fire the timer periodically in periodic
mode, in case it ever gets used in the future.
