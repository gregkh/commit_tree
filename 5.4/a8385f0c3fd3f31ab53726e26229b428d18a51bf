drm/i915: Only enqueue already completed requests

If we are asked to submit a completed request, just move it onto the
active-list without modifying it's payload. If we try to emit the
modified payload of a completed request, we risk racing with the
ring->head update during retirement which may advance the head past our
breadcrumb and so we generate a warning for the emission being behind
the RING_HEAD.

v2: Commentary for the sneaky, shared responsibility between functions.
v3: Spelling mistakes and bonus assertion
