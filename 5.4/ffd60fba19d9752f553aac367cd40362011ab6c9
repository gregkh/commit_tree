ASoC: soc-core: move soc_probe_component() position

It is easy to read code if it is cleanly using paired function/naming,
like start <-> stop, register <-> unregister, etc, etc.
But, current ALSA SoC code is very random, unbalance, not paired, etc.
It is easy to create bug at the such code, and it will be difficult to
debug.

soc_probe_comonent() has paired soc_remove_comonent(),
but, these are implemented at different place.
So it is difficult to confirm code.
This patch moves soc_probe_component() next to
soc_remove_component().
