xtensa: fix {get,put}_user() for 64bit values

First of all, on short copies __copy_{to,from}_user() return the amount
of bytes left uncopied, *not* -EFAULT.  get_user() and put_user() are
expected to return -EFAULT on failure.

Another problem is get_user(v32, (__u64 __user *)p); that should
fetch 64bit value and the assign it to v32, truncating it in process.
Current code, OTOH, reads 8 bytes of data and stores them at the
address of v32, stomping on the 4 bytes that follow v32 itself.
