PCI/VPD: Prevent VPD access for Amazon's Annapurna Labs Root Port

The Amazon Annapurna Labs PCIe Root Port exposes the VPD capability,
but there is no actual support for it.

Trying to access the VPD (for example, as part of lspci -vv or when
reading the vpd sysfs file), results in the following warning print:

  pcieport 0001:00:00.0: VPD access failed.  This is likely a firmware bug on this device.  Contact the card vendor for a firmware update
