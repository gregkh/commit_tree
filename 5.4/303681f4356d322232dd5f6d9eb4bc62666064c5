ALSA: hda: move parts of NHLT code to new module

Move parts of the code outside of the Skylake driver to help detect
the presence of DMICs (which are not supported by the HDaudio legacy
driver).

No functionality change (except for the removal of useless OR
operations), only indentation and checkpatch fixes, making sure
that the code compiles without ACPI and fixing an ACPI leak
