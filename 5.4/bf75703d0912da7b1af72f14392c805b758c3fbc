dmaengine: bcm2835: Avoid accessing memory when copying zeroes

The BCM2835 DMA controller is capable of synthesizing zeroes instead of
copying them from a source address. The feature is enabled by setting
the SRC_IGNORE bit in the Transfer Information field of a Control Block:

"Do not perform source reads.
 In addition, destination writes will zero all the write strobes.
 This is used for fast cache fill operations."

The feature is only available on 8 of the 16 channels. The others are
so-called "lite" channels with a limited feature set and performance.

Enable the feature if a cyclic transaction copies from the zero page.
This reduces traffic on the memory bus.

A forthcoming use case is the BCM2835 SPI driver, which will cyclically
copy from the zero page to the TX FIFO. The idea to use SRC_IGNORE was
taken from an ancient GitHub conversation between Martin and Noralf:
