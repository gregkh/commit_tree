ceph: eliminate session->s_trim_caps

It's only used to keep count of caps being trimmed, but that requires
that we hold the session->s_mutex to prevent multiple trimming
operations from running concurrently.

We can achieve the same effect using an integer on the stack, which
allows us to (eventually) not need the s_mutex.
