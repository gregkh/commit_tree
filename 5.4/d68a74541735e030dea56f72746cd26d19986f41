drm/amd/display: Clear FEC_READY shadow register if DPCD write fails

[why]
As a fail-safe, in case 'set FEC_READY' DPCD write fails, a HW shadow
register should be cleared and the internal FEC stat should be set to
'not ready'. This is to make sure HW settings will be consistent with
FEC_READY state on the RX.
