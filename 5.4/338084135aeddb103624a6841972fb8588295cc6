iio: tsl2772: Use devm_add_action_or_reset for tsl2772_chip_off

Use devm_add_action_or_reset to call tsl2772_chip_off
when the device is removed.
This also fixes the issue that the chip is turned off
before the device is unregistered.

Not marked for stable as fairly hard to hit the bug and
this is in the middle of a set making other cleanups
to the driver.  Hence will probably need explicit backporting.
