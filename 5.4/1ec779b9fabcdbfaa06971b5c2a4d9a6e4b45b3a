docs: packing: move it to core-api book and adjust markups

The packing.txt file was misplaced, as docs should be part of
a documentation book, and not at the root dir.

So, move it to the core-api directory and add to its index.

Also, ensure that the file will be properly parsed and the bitmap
ascii artwork will use a monotonic font.
