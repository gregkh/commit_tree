scsi: lpfc: Fix issuing init_vpi mbox on SLI-3 card

The driver is inadvertently trying to issue an INIT_VPI mailbox command on
an SLI-3 driver. The command is specific to SLI-4. When the call is made to
send the command, if on an SLI-3 adapter, an array pointer is NULL and the
driver will oops.

Fix by restricting the command to SLI-4 adapters only.
