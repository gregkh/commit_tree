io_uring: optimize submit_and_wait API

For some applications that end up using a submit-and-wait type of
approach for certain batches of IO, we can make that a bit more
efficient by allowing the application to block for the last IO
submission. This prevents an async when we don't need it, as the
application will be blocking for the completion event(s) anyway.

Typical use cases are using the liburing
io_uring_submit_and_wait() API, or just using io_uring_enter()
doing both submissions and completions. As a specific example,
RocksDB doing MultiGet() is sped up quite a bit with this
change.
