drop_monitor: Allow user to start monitoring hardware drops

Drop monitor has start and stop commands, but so far these were only
used to start and stop monitoring of software drops.

Now that drop monitor can also monitor hardware drops, we should allow
the user to control these as well.

Do that by adding SW and HW flags to these commands. If no flag is
specified, then only start / stop monitoring software drops. This is
done in order to maintain backward-compatibility with existing user
space applications.
