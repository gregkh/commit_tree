char: ppdev: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in pp_release()

In pp_release(), there is an if statement on line 730 to check whether
pp->pdev is NULL:
    else if ((pp->flags & PP_CLAIMED) && pp->pdev && ...)

When pp->pdev is NULL, it is used on line 743:
    info = &pp->pdev->port->ieee1284;
and on line 748:
    parport_release(pp->pdev);

Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.

To fix this bug, pp->pdev is checked on line 740.

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
