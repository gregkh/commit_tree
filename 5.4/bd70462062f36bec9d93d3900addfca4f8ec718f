perf evlist: Remove unused perf_evlist__fprintf() method

Ditch it, noone is using it, one more stdio.h include in a hot header.

Fix the fallout in parse-events.y, where we end up using a FILE pointer,
I think due to YYDEBUG being set and in some places, like Amazon Linux 1
we don't get stdio.h included by luck, like in most other places, add a
explicit stdio.h include directive.
