nvme-pci: Support shared tags across queues for Apple 2018 controllers

Another issue with the Apple T2 based 2018 controllers seem to be
that they blow up (and shut the machine down) if there's a tag
collision between the IO queue and the Admin queue.

My suspicion is that they use our tags for their internal tracking
and don't mix them with the queue id. They also seem to not like
when tags go beyond the IO queue depth, ie 128 tags.

This adds a quirk that marks tags 0..31 of the IO queue reserved
