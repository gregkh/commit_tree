cgroup/cpuset: Change cpuset_rwsem and hotplug lock order

cpuset_rwsem is going to be acquired from sched_setscheduler() with a
following patch. There are however paths (e.g., spawn_ksoftirqd) in
which sched_scheduler() is eventually called while holding hotplug lock;
this creates a dependecy between hotplug lock (to be always acquired
first) and cpuset_rwsem (to be always acquired after hotplug lock).

Fix paths which currently take the two locks in the wrong order (after
a following patch is applied).
