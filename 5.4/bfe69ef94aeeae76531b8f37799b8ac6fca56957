nouveau: simplify nouveau_dmem_migrate_to_ram

Factor the main copy page to ram routine out into a helper that acts on
a single page and which doesn't require the nouveau_dmem_fault
structure for argument passing.  Also remove the loop over multiple
pages as we only handle one at the moment, although the structure of
the main worker function makes it relatively easy to add multi page
support back if needed in the future.  But at least for now this avoid
the needed to dynamically allocate memory for the dma addresses in
what is essentially the page fault path.
