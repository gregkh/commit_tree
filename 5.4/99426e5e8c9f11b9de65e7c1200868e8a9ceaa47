arm64: dump: De-constify VA_START and KASAN_SHADOW_START

The kernel page table dumper assumes that the placement of VA regions is
constant and determined at compile time. As we are about to introduce
variable VA logic, we need to be able to determine certain regions at
boot time.

Specifically the VA_START and KASAN_SHADOW_START will depend on whether
or not the system is booted with 52-bit kernel VAs.

This patch adds logic to the kernel page table dumper s.t. these regions
can be computed at boot time.
