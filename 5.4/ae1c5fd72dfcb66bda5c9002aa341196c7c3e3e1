drm/i915/gtt: Handle double alloc failures

Matthew pointed out that we could face a double failure with concurrent
allocations/frees, and so the assumption that the local var alloc was
NULL was fraught with danger. Rather than complicate the error paths too
much to add a second local for a second free, just do the second free
earlier on the unwind path.
