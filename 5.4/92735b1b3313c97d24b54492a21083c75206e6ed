KVM: x86: Unconditionally call x86 ops that are always implemented

Remove a few stale checks for non-NULL ops now that the ops in question
are implemented by both VMX and SVM.

Note, this is **not** stable material, the Fixes tags are there purely
to show when a particular op was first supported by both VMX and SVM.

Fixes: 74f169090b6f ("kvm/svm: Setup MCG_CAP on AMD properly")
Fixes: b31c114b82b2 ("KVM: X86: Provide a capability to disable PAUSE intercepts")
Fixes: 411b44ba80ab ("svm: Implements update_pi_irte hook to setup posted interrupt")
