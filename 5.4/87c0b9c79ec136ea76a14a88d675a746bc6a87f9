intel_th: gth: Fix the window switching sequence

Commit 8116db57cf16 ("intel_th: Add switch triggering support") added
a trigger assertion of the CTS, but forgot to de-assert it at the end
of the sequence. This results in window switches randomly not happening.

Fix that by de-asserting the trigger at the end of the window switch
sequence.
