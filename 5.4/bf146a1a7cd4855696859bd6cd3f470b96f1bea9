arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e: Update the power domain cells

Update the power-domain cells to 2 and mark all devices as
exclusive. Main uart 0 is the debug console for processor boards
and it is used by different software entities like u-boot, atf,
linux simultaneously. So just mark main_uart0 as shared device
for common processor board.
