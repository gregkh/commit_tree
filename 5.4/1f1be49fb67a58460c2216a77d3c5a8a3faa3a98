drm/i915: Avoid HPD poll detect triggering a new detect cycle

For the HPD interrupt functionality the HW depends on power wells in the
display core domain to be on. Accordingly when enabling these power
wells the HPD polling logic will force an HPD detection cycle to account
for hotplug events that may have happened when such a power well was
off.

Thus a detect cycle started by polling could start a new detect cycle if
a power well in the display core domain gets enabled during detect and
stays enabled after detect completes. That in turn can lead to a
detection cycle runaway.

To prevent re-triggering a poll-detect cycle make sure we drop all power
references we acquired during detect synchronously by the end of detect.
This will let the poll-detect logic continue with polling (matching the
off state of the corresponding power wells) instead of scheduling a new
detection cycle.
