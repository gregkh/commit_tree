netfilter: nft_dynset: support for element deletion

This patch implements the delete operation from the ruleset.

It implements a new delete() function in nft_set_rhash. It is simpler
to use than the already existing remove(), because it only takes the set
and the key as arguments, whereas remove() expects a full
nft_set_elem structure.
