interconnect: qcom: remove COMPILE_TEST from CONFIG_INTERCONNECT_QCOM_QCS404

There is one compilation error when CONFIG_INTERCONNECT_QCOM_QCS404=y and
CONFIG_INTERCONNECT_QCOM_SMD_RPM=y, as well as CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST=y,
but CONFIG_QCOM_SMD_RPM is not set, logs as below:

drivers/interconnect/qcom/smd-rpm.o: In function `qcom_icc_rpm_smd_send':
smd-rpm.c:(.text+0xe4): undefined reference to `qcom_rpm_smd_write'
Makefile:1071: recipe for target 'vmlinux' failed
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

This is because
INTERCONNECT_QCOM_QCS404 depends on QCOM_SMD_RPM || COMPILE_TEST.
Here CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST=y, so CONFIG_INTERCONNECT_QCOM_SMD_RPM
is selected. If CONFIG_QCOM_SMD_RPM is not set, then
qcom_rpm_smd_write() is not defined, and compilation error happen.
Fix this by removing COMPILE_TEST from CONFIG_INTERCONNECT_QCOM_QCS404.
