irqchip/sifive-plic: Skip contexts except supervisor in plic_init()

Modify plic_init() to skip .dts interrupt contexts other
than supervisor external interrupt.

The .dts entry for plic may specify multiple interrupt contexts.
For example, it may assign two entries IRQ_M_EXT and IRQ_S_EXT,
in that order, to the same interrupt controller. This patch
modifies plic_init() to skip the IRQ_M_EXT context since
IRQ_S_EXT is currently the only supported context.

If IRQ_M_EXT is not skipped, plic_init() will report "handler
already present for context" when it comes across the IRQ_S_EXT
context in the next iteration of its loop.

Without this patch, .dts would have to be edited to replace the
value of IRQ_M_EXT with -1 for it to be skipped.
