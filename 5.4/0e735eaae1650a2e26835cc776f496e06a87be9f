rtc: pcf2127: add watchdog feature support

Add partial support for the watchdog functionality of
both PCF2127 and PCF2129 chips.

The programmable watchdog timer is currently using a fixed
clock source of 1Hz. This result in a selectable range of
1-255 seconds, which covers most embedded Linux use-cases.

Clock sources of 4096Hz, 64Hz and 1/60Hz is mostly useful
in MCU use-cases.

Countdown timer not available when using watchdog feature.
