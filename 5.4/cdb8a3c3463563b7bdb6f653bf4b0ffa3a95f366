iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Avoid locking on invalidation path when not using ATS

When ATS is not in use, we can avoid taking the 'devices_lock' for the
domain on the invalidation path by simply caching the number of ATS
masters currently attached. The fiddly part is handling a concurrent
->attach() of an ATS-enabled master to a domain that is being
invalidated, but we can handle this using an 'smp_mb()' to ensure that
our check of the count is ordered after completion of our prior TLB
invalidation.

This also makes our ->attach() and ->detach() flows symmetric wrt ATS
interactions.
