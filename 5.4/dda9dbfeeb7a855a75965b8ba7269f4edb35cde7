powerpc/fadump: consider reserved ranges while releasing memory

Commit 0962e8004e97 ("powerpc/prom: Scan reserved-ranges node for
memory reservations") enabled support to parse 'reserved-ranges' DT
node to reserve kernel memory falling in these ranges for firmware
purposes. Along with the preserved area memory, ensure memory in
reserved ranges is not overlapped with memory released by capture
kernel aftering saving vmcore. Also, fix the off-by-one error in
fadump_release_reserved_area function while releasing memory.
