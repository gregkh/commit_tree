ARM: dts: logicpd-som-lv: Fix i2c2 and i2c3 Pin mux

When the pinmux configuration was added, it was accidentally placed into
the omap3_pmx_wkup node  when it should have been placed into the
omap3_pmx_core.  This error was accidentally propagated to stable by
me when I blindly requested the pull after seeing I2C issues without
actually reviewing the content of the pinout.  Since the bootloader
previously muxed these correctly in the past, was a hidden error.

This patch moves the i2c2_pins and i2c3_pins to the correct node
which should eliminate i2c bus errors and timeouts due to the fact
the bootloader uses the save device tree that no longer properly
assigns these pins.

Fixes: 5fe3c0fa0d54 ("ARM: dts: Add pinmuxing for i2c2 and i2c3
for LogicPD SOM-LV") #4.9+
