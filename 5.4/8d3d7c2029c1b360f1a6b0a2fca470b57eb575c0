usbnet: ignore endpoints with invalid wMaxPacketSize

Endpoints with zero wMaxPacketSize are not usable for transferring
data. Ignore such endpoints when looking for valid in, out and
status pipes, to make the drivers more robust against invalid and
meaningless descriptors.

The wMaxPacketSize of these endpoints are used for memory allocations
and as divisors in many usbnet minidrivers. Avoiding zero is therefore
critical.
