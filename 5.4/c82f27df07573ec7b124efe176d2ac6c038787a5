regulator: core: Fix error return for /sys access

regulator_uV_show() is missing error handling if regulator_get_voltage_rdev()
returns negative values. Instead it prints the errno as a string, e.g. -EINVAL
as "-22" which could be interpreted as -22 ÂµV.

We also do not need to hold the lock while converting the integer to a string.
