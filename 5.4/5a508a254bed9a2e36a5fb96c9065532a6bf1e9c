devlink: disallow reload operation during device cleanup

There is a race between driver code that does setup/cleanup of device
and devlink reload operation that in some drivers works with the same
code. Use after free could we easily obtained by running:

while true; do
        echo "0000:00:10.0" >/sys/bus/pci/drivers/mlxsw_spectrum2/bind
        devlink dev reload pci/0000:00:10.0 &
        echo "0000:00:10.0" >/sys/bus/pci/drivers/mlxsw_spectrum2/unbind
done

Fix this by enabling reload only after setup of device is complete and
disabling it at the beginning of the cleanup process.
