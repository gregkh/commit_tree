scsi: lpfc: Fix ADISC reception terminating login state if a NVME target

If a target issues an ADISC to the port and the target is a NVME target,
the driver is inadvertantly invalidating the login and marking the remote
port as logged out. Communication with the target is lost.

Revise the ADISC check so that FCP or NVME targets will be marked valid at
the end of ADISC processing.  Enhance logging to recognize condition
better.
