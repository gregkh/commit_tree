x86/apic/32: Avoid bogus LDR warnings

The removal of the LDR initialization in the bigsmp_32 APIC code unearthed
a problem in setup_local_APIC().

The code checks unconditionally for a mismatch of the logical APIC id by
comparing the early APIC id which was initialized in get_smp_config() with
the actual LDR value in the APIC.

Due to the removal of the bogus LDR initialization the check now can
trigger on bigsmp_32 APIC systems emitting a warning for every booting
CPU. This is of course a false positive because the APIC is not using
logical destination mode.

Restrict the check and the possibly resulting fixup to systems which are
actually using the APIC in logical destination mode.
