arm64: memory: rename VA_START to PAGE_END

Prior to commit:

  14c127c957c1c607 ("arm64: mm: Flip kernel VA space")

... VA_START described the start of the TTBR1 address space for a given
VA size described by VA_BITS, where all kernel mappings began.

Since that commit, VA_START described a portion midway through the
address space, where the linear map ends and other kernel mappings
begin.

To avoid confusion, let's rename VA_START to PAGE_END, making it clear
that it's not the start of the TTBR1 address space and implying that
it's related to PAGE_OFFSET. Comments and other mnemonics are updated
accordingly, along with a typo fix in the decription of VMEMMAP_SIZE.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
