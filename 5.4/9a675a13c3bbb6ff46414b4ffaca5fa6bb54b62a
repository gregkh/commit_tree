	Could you drop this patch from the staging-next tree? This is
	because John is making some changes to the put_user_page*()
	functions. He has submitted a patch recently removing
	put_user_page_dirty() function which is being used in this
	patch. This might break the kernel build if John's patch gets
	merged in.

	I ll submit a patch once the put_user_page*() apis are fixed.
