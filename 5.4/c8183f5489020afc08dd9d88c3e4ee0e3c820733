s390/qeth: fix potential deadlock on workqueue flush

The L2 bridgeport code uses the coarse 'conf_mutex' for guarding access
to its configuration state.
This can result in a deadlock when qeth_l2_stop_card() - called under the
conf_mutex - blocks on flush_workqueue() to wait for the completion of
pending bridgeport workers. Such workers would also need to aquire
the conf_mutex, stalling indefinitely.

Introduce a lock that specifically guards the bridgeport configuration,
so that the workers no longer need the conf_mutex.
Wrapping qeth_l2_promisc_to_bridge() in this fine-grained lock then also
fixes a theoretical race against a concurrent qeth_bridge_port_role_store()
operation.
