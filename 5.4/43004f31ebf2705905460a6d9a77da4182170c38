spi: Rename of_spi_register_master() function

Rename this function to of_spi_get_gpio_numbers() as this
is what the function does, it does not register a master,
it is called in the path of registering a master so the
name is logical in a convoluted way, but it is better to
follow Rusty Russell's ABI level no 7:
"The obvious use is (probably) the correct one"
