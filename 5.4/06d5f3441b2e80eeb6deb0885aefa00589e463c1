net: phy: at803x: use operating parameters from PHY-specific status

Read the PHY-specific status register for the current operating mode
(speed and duplex) of the PHY.  This register reflects the actual
mode that the PHY has resolved depending on either the advertisements
of autoneg is enabled, or the forced mode if autoneg is disabled.

This ensures that phylib's software state always tracks the hardware
state.

It seems both AR8033 (which uses the AR8031 ID) and AR8035 support
this status register.  AR8030 is not known at the present time.

This patch depends on "net: phy: extract pause mode" and "net: phy:
extract link partner advertisement reading".
