ASoC: rsnd: Reinitialize bit clock inversion flag for every format setting

Unlike other format-related DAI parameters, rdai->bit_clk_inv flag
is not properly re-initialized when setting format for new stream
processing. The inversion, if requested, is then applied not to default,
but to a previous value, which leads to SCKP bit in SSICR register being
set incorrectly.
Fix this by re-setting the flag to its initial value, determined by format.
