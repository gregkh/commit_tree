modpost: delegate updating namespaces to separate function

Let the function 'sym_update_namespace' take care of updating the
namespace for a symbol. While this currently only replaces one single
location where namespaces are updated, in a following patch, this
function will get more call sites.

The function signature is intentionally close to sym_update_crc and
taking the name by char* seems like unnecessary work as the symbol has
to be looked up again. In a later patch of this series, this concern
will be addressed.

This function ensures that symbol::namespace is either NULL or has a
valid non-empty value. Previously, the empty string was considered 'no
namespace' as well and this lead to confusion.
