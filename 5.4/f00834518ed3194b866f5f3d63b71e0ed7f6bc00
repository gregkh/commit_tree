binder: add a mount option to show global stats

Currently, all binder state and statistics live in debugfs.
We need this information even when debugfs is not mounted.
This patch adds the mount option 'stats' to enable a binderfs
instance to have binder debug information present in the same.
'stats=global' will enable the global binder statistics. In
the future, 'stats=local' will enable binder statistics local
to the binderfs instance. The two modes 'global' and 'local'
will be mutually exclusive. 'stats=global' option is only available
for a binderfs instance mounted in the initial user namespace.
An attempt to use the option to mount a binderfs instance in
another user namespace will return an EPERM error.
