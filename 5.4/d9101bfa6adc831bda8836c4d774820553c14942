powerpc/mm/mce: Keep irqs disabled during lockless page table walk

__find_linux_mm_pte() returns a page table entry pointer after walking
the page table without holding locks. To make it safe against a THP
split and/or collapse, we disable interrupts around the lockless page
table walk. However we need to keep interrupts disabled as long as we
use the page table entry pointer that is returned.

Fix addr_to_pfn() to do that.
