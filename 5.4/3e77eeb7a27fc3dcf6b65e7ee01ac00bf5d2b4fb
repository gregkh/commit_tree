ACPI/IORT: Rename arm_smmu_v3_set_proximity() 'node' local variable

Commit 36a2ba07757d ("ACPI/IORT: Reject platform device creation on NUMA
node mapping failure") introduced a local variable 'node' in
arm_smmu_v3_set_proximity() that shadows the struct acpi_iort_node
pointer function parameter.

Execution was unaffected but it is prone to errors and can lead
to subtle bugs.

Rename the local variable to prevent any issue.
