scsi: qla2xxx: Enable type checking for the SRB free and done callback functions

Since all pointers passed to the srb_t.done() and srb_t.free() functions
have type srb_t, change the type of the first argument of these functions
from void * into struct srb *. This allows the compiler to verify the
argument types for these functions. This patch does not change any
functionality.
