net: stmmac: xgmac: Detect Hash Table size dinamically

Since commit b8ef7020d6e5 ("net: stmmac: add support for hash table size
128/256 in dwmac4"), we can detect the Hash Table dinamically.

Let's implement this feature in XGMAC cores and fix possible setups that
don't support the maximum size for Hash Table.
