ASoC: pcm3168a: Allow reconfiguration of tdm_slots and slot_width

When using right_j format and the codec is slave it can support 16bit
format, but only if slot_width == 16, in the same DAI mode the 24 bit
audio can work with 24 or 32 slot_width.

Because of this, the codec and CPU needs to be reconfigured when the sample
format changes.
