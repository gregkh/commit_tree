drm/i915/tgl: add support for reading the timestamp frequency

There are no changes with respect to GEN11, which Paulo wrote.

This gets rid of the "Missing switch case in read_timestamp_frequency"
message at boot for Tiger Lake.

[ Lucas: BSpec: 10742 and 9024, but there's a mismatch on the values.
  Let's say a glitch in the spec. Tested locally and it works. ]
