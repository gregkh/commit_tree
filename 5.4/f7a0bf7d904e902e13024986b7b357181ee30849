powerpc/32s: add an option to exclusively select powerpc 601

Powerpc 601 is rather old powerpc which as some important
limitations compared to other book3s/32 powerpcs:
- No Timebase.
- Common BATs for instruction and data.
- No execution protection in segment registers.
- No RI bit in MSR
- ...

It is starting to be difficult and cumbersome to maintain
kernels that are compatible both with 601 and other 6xx cores.

Create a compiletime option to exclusively select either powerpc 601
or other 6xx.
