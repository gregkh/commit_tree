media: don't do a 31 bit shift on a signed int

On 32-bits archs, a signed integer has 31 bits plus on extra
bit for signal. Due to that, touching the 32th bit with something
like:

	int bar = 1 << 31;

has an undefined behavior in C on 32 bit architectures, as it
touches the signal bit. This is warned by cppcheck.

Instead, force the numbers to be unsigned, in order to solve this
issue.
