um: Implement TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT

UML enables TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT but doesn't actually implement
it. It seems to have been added for lockdep support, but that can't
actually really work well without IRQ flags tracing, as is also
very noisily reported when enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKDEP.

Implement it now.
