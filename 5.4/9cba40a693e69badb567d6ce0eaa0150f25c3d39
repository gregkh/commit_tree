Btrfs: factor out extent dropping code from hole punch handler

Move the code that is responsible for dropping extents in a range out of
btrfs_punch_hole() into a new helper function, btrfs_punch_hole_range(),
so that later it can be used by the reflinking (extent cloning and dedup)
code to fix a ENOSPC bug.
