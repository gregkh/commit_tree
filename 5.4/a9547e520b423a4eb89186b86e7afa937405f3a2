media: dvb-usb: add T230 to dvbsky

commit 5fa88151ecdb ("[media] dvb-usb-cxusb: Geniatech T230 - resync TS
FIFO after lock") does not solve the problem for all devices. This is the
same issue reported on the T230C, which was moved to the dvbsky.c driver
to work around this issue in commit 5742240577b6 ("media: dvbsky: MyGica
T230C support").

In addition, the cxusb driver causes an oops when unplugging the device
while streaming; this problem does not happen any more.
