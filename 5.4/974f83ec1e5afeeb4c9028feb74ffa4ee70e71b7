ia64: rework iommu probing

ia64 currently organizes the iommu probing along machves, which isn't
very helpful.  Instead just try to probe for Intel IOMMUs in mem_init
as they are properly described in ACPI and if none was found initialize
the swiotlb buffer.  The HP SBA handling is then only done delayed when
the actual hardware is probed. Only in the case that we actually found
usable IOMMUs we then set up the DMA ops and free the not needed
swiotlb buffer.  This scheme gets rid of the need for the dma_init
machvec operation, and the dig_vtd machvec.
