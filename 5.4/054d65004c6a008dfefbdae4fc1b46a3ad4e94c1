ASoC: codec2codec: name link using stream direction

At the moment, codec to codec dai link widgets are named after the
cpu dai and the 1st codec valid on the link. This might be confusing
if there is multiple valid codecs on the link for one stream
direction.

Instead, use the dai link name and the stream direction to name the
the dai link widget
