staging: wilc1000: Don't reset WILC CPU disgracefully

Send abort request to WILC from wilc_wlan_stop instead of resetting the
CPU.
The abort request was being sent from wilc_wlan_cleanup after the CPU
was reset which wasn't the correct order. The abort request handler
in the chip will take care of resetting the CPU.
