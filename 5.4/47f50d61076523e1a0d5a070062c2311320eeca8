xhci: Fix USB 3.1 capability detection on early xHCI 1.1 spec based hosts

Early xHCI 1.1 spec did not mention USB 3.1 capable hosts should set
sbrn to 0x31, or that the minor revision is a two digit BCD
containing minor and sub-minor numbers.
This was later clarified in xHCI 1.2.

Some USB 3.1 capable hosts therefore have sbrn set to 0x30, or minor
revision set to 0x1 instead of 0x10.

Detect the USB 3.1 capability correctly for these hosts as well
