io_uring: extend async work merging

We currently merge async work items if we see a strict sequential hit.
This helps avoid unnecessary workqueue switches when we don't need
them. We can extend this merging to cover cases where it's not a strict
sequential hit, but the IO still fits within the same page. If an
application is doing multiple requests within the same page, we don't
want separate workers waiting on the same page to complete IO. It's much
faster to let the first worker bring in the page, then operate on that
page from the same worker to complete the next request(s).
