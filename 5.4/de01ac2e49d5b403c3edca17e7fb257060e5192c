staging: fsl-dpaa2/ethsw: add .ndo_fdb_dump callback

Implement the .ndo_fdb_dump callback for the switch net devices.  The
list of all offloaded FDB entries is retrieved through the dpsw_fdb_dump()
firmware call. Filter the entries by the switch port on which the
callback was called and for each of them create a new neighbour message.
Also remove the requirement from the TODO list.
