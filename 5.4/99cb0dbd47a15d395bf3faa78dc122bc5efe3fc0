mm,thp: add read-only THP support for (non-shmem) FS

This patch is (hopefully) the first step to enable THP for non-shmem
filesystems.

This patch enables an application to put part of its text sections to THP
via madvise, for example:

    madvise((void *)0x600000, 0x200000, MADV_HUGEPAGE);

We tried to reuse the logic for THP on tmpfs.

Currently, write is not supported for non-shmem THP.  khugepaged will only
process vma with VM_DENYWRITE.  sys_mmap() ignores VM_DENYWRITE requests
(see ksys_mmap_pgoff).  The only way to create vma with VM_DENYWRITE is
execve().  This requirement limits non-shmem THP to text sections.

The next patch will handle writes, which would only happen when the all
the vmas with VM_DENYWRITE are unmapped.

An EXPERIMENTAL config, READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS, is added to gate this
feature.
