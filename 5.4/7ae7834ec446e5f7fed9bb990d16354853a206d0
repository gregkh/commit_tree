ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Add support for DSP formats

In addition to the I2S format, the controller also supports the DSP_*
formats.

This requires some extra care on the LRCK period calculation, since the
controller, with the PCM formats, require that the value set is no longer
the periods of LRCK for a single channel, but for all of them.

Let's add the code to deal with this, and support the DSP_A and DSP_B
formats.
