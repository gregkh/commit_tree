s390/unwind: fix mixing regs and sp

unwind_for_each_frame stops after the first frame if regs->gprs[15] <=
sp.

The reason is that in case regs are specified, the first frame should be
regs->psw.addr and the second frame should be sp->gprs[8]. However,
currently the second frame is regs->gprs[15], which confuses
outside_of_stack().

Fix by introducing a flag to distinguish this special case from
unwinding the interrupt handler, for which the current behavior is
appropriate.
