scsi: lpfc: Merge per-protocol WQ/CQ pairs into single per-cpu pair

Currently, each hardware queue, typically allocated per-cpu, consists of a
WQ/CQ pair per protocol. Meaning if both SCSI and NVMe are supported 2
WQ/CQ pairs will exist for the hardware queue. Separate queues are
unnecessary. The current implementation wastes memory backing the 2nd set
of queues, and the use of double the SLI-4 WQ/CQ's means less hardware
queues can be supported which means there may not always be enough to have
a pair per cpu. If there is only 1 pair per cpu, more cpu's may get their
own WQ/CQ.

Rework the implementation to use a single WQ/CQ pair by both protocols.
