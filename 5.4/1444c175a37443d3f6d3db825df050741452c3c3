net: sched: copy tunnel info when setting flow_action entry->tunnel

In order to remove dependency on rtnl lock, modify tc_setup_flow_action()
to copy tunnel info, instead of just saving pointer to tunnel_key action
tunnel info. This is necessary to prevent concurrent action overwrite from
releasing tunnel info while it is being used by rtnl-unlocked driver.

Implement helper tcf_tunnel_info_copy() that is used to copy tunnel info
with all its options to dynamically allocated memory block. Modify
tc_cleanup_flow_action() to free dynamically allocated tunnel info.
