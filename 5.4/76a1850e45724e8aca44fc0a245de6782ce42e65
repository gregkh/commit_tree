mm/debug.c: __dump_page() prints an extra line

When dumping struct page information, __dump_page() prints the page type
with a trailing blank followed by the page flags on a separate line:

  anon
  flags: 0x100000000090034(uptodate|lru|active|head|swapbacked)

It looks like the intent was to use pr_cont() for printing "flags:" but
pr_cont() usage is discouraged so fix this by extending the format to
include the flags into a single line:

  anon flags: 0x100000000090034(uptodate|lru|active|head|swapbacked)

If the page is file backed, the name might be long so use two lines:

  shmem_aops name:"dev/zero"
  flags: 0x10000000008000c(uptodate|dirty|swapbacked)

Eliminate pr_conf() usage as well for appending compound_mapcount.
