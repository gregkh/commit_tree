blk-zoned: implement REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET_ALL

This implements REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET_ALL as a special case of the block
device zone reset operations where we just simply issue bio with the
newly introduced req op.

We issue this req op when the number of sectors is equal to the device's
partition's number of sectors and device has no partitions.

We also add support so that blk_op_str() can print the new reset-all
zone operation.

This patch also adds a generic make request check for newly
introduced REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET_ALL req_opf. We simply return error
when queue is zoned and reset-all flag is not set for
REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET_ALL.
