crypto: hisilicon - add hardware SGL support

HiSilicon accelerators in Hip08 use same hardware scatterlist for data format.
We support it in this module.

Specific accelerator drivers can use hisi_acc_create_sgl_pool to allocate
hardware SGLs ahead. Then use hisi_acc_sg_buf_map_to_hw_sgl to get one
hardware SGL and pass related information to hardware SGL.

The DMA address of mapped hardware SGL can be passed to SGL src/dst field
in QM SQE.
