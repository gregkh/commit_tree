drm/i915/pmu: Atomically acquire the gt_pm wakeref

Currently, we only sample if the intel_gt is awake, but we acquire our
own runtime_pm wakeref. Since intel_gt has transitioned to tracking its
own wakeref, we can atomically test and acquire that wakeref instead.

v2: Take engine->wakeref for engine sampling
