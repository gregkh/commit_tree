afs: Fix possible assert with callbacks from yfs servers

Servers sending callback breaks to the YFS_CM_SERVICE service may
send up to YFSCBMAX (1024) fids in a single RPC.  Anything over
AFSCBMAX (50) will cause the assert in afs_break_callbacks to trigger.

Remove the assert, as the count has already been checked against
the appropriate max values in afs_deliver_cb_callback and
afs_deliver_yfs_cb_callback.
