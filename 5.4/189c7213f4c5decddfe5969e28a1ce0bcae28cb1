ACPICA: Debugger: remove redundant assignment on obj_desc

ACPICA commit f530f1acb3128136ad97c715fdaebbbeff283ee2

Pointer obj_desc is being initialized with a value that is never
read and it is being updated later with a new value. The initialization
is redundant and can be removed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
