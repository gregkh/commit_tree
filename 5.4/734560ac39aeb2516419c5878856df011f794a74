powerpc/pseries/svm: Export guest SVM status to user space via sysfs

User space might want to know it's running in a secure VM.  It can't do
a mfmsr because mfmsr is a privileged instruction.

The solution here is to create a cpu attribute:

/sys/devices/system/cpu/svm

which will read 0 or 1 based on the S bit of the current CPU.
