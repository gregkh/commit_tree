mfd: cros_ec: Add convenience struct to define autodetectable CrOS EC subdevices

The CrOS EC is gaining lots of subdevices that are autodetectable by
sending the EC_FEATURE_GET_CMD, it takes fair amount of boiler plate
code to add those devices. So, add a struct that can be used to quickly
add new subdevices without having to duplicate code.
