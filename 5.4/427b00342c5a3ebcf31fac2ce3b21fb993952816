mmc: queue: Fix bigger segments usage

The commit 38c38cb73223 ("mmc: queue: use bigger segments if DMA MAP
layer can merge the segments") always enables the bugger segments
if DMA MAP layer can merge the segments, but some controllers (SDHCI)
have strictly limitation about the segments size, and then the commit
breaks on the controllers.

To fix the issue, this patch adds a new flag MMC_CAP2_MERGE_CAPABLE
into the struct mmc_host and the bigger segments usage is disabled
as default.
