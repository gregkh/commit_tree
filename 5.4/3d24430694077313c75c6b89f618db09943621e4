block: make rq sector size accessible for block stats

Currently rq->data_len will be decreased by partial completion or
zeroed by completion, so when blk_stat_add() is invoked, data_len
will be zero and there will never be samples in poll_cb because
blk_mq_poll_stats_bkt() will return -1 if data_len is zero.

We could move blk_stat_add() back to __blk_mq_complete_request(),
but that would make the effort of trying to call ktime_get_ns()
once in vain. Instead we can reuse throtl_size field, and use
it for both block stats and block throttle, and adjust the
logic in blk_mq_poll_stats_bkt() accordingly.
