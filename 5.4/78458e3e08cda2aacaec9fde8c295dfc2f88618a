netfilter: add missing IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NETFILTER) checks to some header-files.

linux/netfilter.h defines a number of struct and inline function
definitions which are only available is CONFIG_NETFILTER is enabled.
These structs and functions are used in declarations and definitions in
other header-files.  Added preprocessor checks to make sure these
headers will compile if CONFIG_NETFILTER is disabled.
