powerpc/fadump: move internal macros/definitions to a new header

Though asm/fadump.h is meant to be used by other components dealing
with FADump, it also has macros/definitions internal to FADump code.
Move them to a new header file used within FADump code. This also
makes way for refactoring platform specific FADump code.
