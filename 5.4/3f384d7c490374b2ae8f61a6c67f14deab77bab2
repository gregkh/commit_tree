usbip: vhci_hcd indicate failed message

If the return value of vhci_init_attr_group and
sysfs_create_group is non-zero, which mean they failed
to init attr_group and create sysfs group, so it would
better add 'failed' message to indicate that.
This patch also change pr_err to dev_err to trace which
device is failed.
