net: fix installing orphaned programs

When netdevice with offloaded BPF programs is destroyed
the programs are orphaned and removed from the program
IDA - their IDs get released (the programs may remain
accessible via existing open file descriptors and pinned
files). After IDs are released they are set to 0.

This confuses dev_change_xdp_fd() because it compares
the __dev_xdp_query() result where 0 means no program
with prog->aux->id where 0 means orphaned.

dev_change_xdp_fd() would have incorrectly returned success
even though it had not installed the program.

Since drivers already catch this case via bpf_offload_dev_match()
let them handle this case. The error message drivers produce in
this case ("program loaded for a different device") is in fact
correct as the orphaned program must had to be loaded for a
different device.
