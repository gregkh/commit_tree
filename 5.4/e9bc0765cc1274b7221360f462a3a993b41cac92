arm64: dts: meson-g12a: enable DVFS on G12A boards

Enable DVFS for the U200, SEI520 and X96-Max Amlogic G12A based board
by setting the clock, OPP and supply for each CPU cores.

The CPU cluster power supply can achieve 0.73V to 1.01V using a PWM
output clocked at 800KHz with an inverse duty-cycle.

DVFS has been tested by running the arm64 cpuburn at [1] and cycling
between all the possible cpufreq translations and checking the final
frequency using the clock-measurer, script at [2].
