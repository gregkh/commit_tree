arm64: mm: Separate out vmemmap

vmemmap is a preprocessor definition that depends on a variable,
memstart_addr. In a later patch we will need to expand the size of
the VMEMMAP region and optionally modify vmemmap depending upon
whether or not hardware support is available for 52-bit virtual
addresses.

This patch changes vmemmap to be a variable. As the old definition
depended on a variable load, this should not affect performance
noticeably.
