drm/i915: Serialize insertion into the file->mm.request_list

Currently, we remove the from per-file request list for throttling and
retirement under a dedicated spinlock, but insertion is governed by
struct_mutex. This needs to be the same lock so that the
retirement/insertion of neighbouring requests (at the tail) doesn't
break the list.
