powerpc/kvm: Fix kvmppc_vcore->in_guest value in kvmhv_switch_to_host

kvmhv_switch_to_host() in arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S
needs to set kvmppc_vcore->in_guest to 0 to signal secondary CPUs to
continue. This happens after resetting the PCR. Before commit
13c7bb3c57dc ("powerpc/64s: Set reserved PCR bits"), r0 would always
be 0 before it was stored to kvmppc_vcore->in_guest. However because
of this change in the commit:

          /* Reset PCR */
          ld      r0, VCORE_PCR(r5)
  -       cmpdi   r0, 0
  +       LOAD_REG_IMMEDIATE(r6, PCR_MASK)
  +       cmpld   r0, r6
          beq     18f
  -       li      r0, 0
  -       mtspr   SPRN_PCR, r0
  +       mtspr   SPRN_PCR, r6
   18:
          /* Signal secondary CPUs to continue */
          stb     r0,VCORE_IN_GUEST(r5)

We are no longer comparing r0 against 0 and loading it with 0 if it
contains something else. Hence when we store r0 to
kvmppc_vcore->in_guest, it might not be 0. This means that secondary
CPUs will not be signalled to continue. Those CPUs get stuck and
errors like the following are logged:

    KVM: CPU 1 seems to be stuck
    KVM: CPU 2 seems to be stuck
    KVM: CPU 3 seems to be stuck
    KVM: CPU 4 seems to be stuck
    KVM: CPU 5 seems to be stuck
    KVM: CPU 6 seems to be stuck
    KVM: CPU 7 seems to be stuck

This can be reproduced with:
    $ for i in `seq 1 7` ; do chcpu -d $i ; done ;
    $ taskset -c 0 qemu-system-ppc64 -smp 8,threads=8 \
       -M pseries,accel=kvm,kvm-type=HV -m 1G -nographic -vga none \
       -kernel vmlinux -initrd initrd.cpio.xz

Fix by making sure r0 is 0 before storing it to
kvmppc_vcore->in_guest.
