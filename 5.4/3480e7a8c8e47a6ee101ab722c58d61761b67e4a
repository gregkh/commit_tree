scsi: qedf: Fix race betwen fipvlan request and response path

There is a race b/w fipvlan request and response path:

=====
qedf_fcoe_process_vlan_resp:113]:2: VLAN response, vid=0xffd.
qedf_initiate_fipvlan_req:165]:2: vlan = 0x6ffd already set.
qedf_set_vlan_id:139]:2: Setting vlan_id=0ffd prio=3.
======

The request thread sees that vlan is already set and fails to call
ctrl_link_up.

Fix:

 - While setting vlan_id use local variable and before setting vlan_id.

 - Call fcoe_ctlr_link_up in next iteration of fipvlan request.
