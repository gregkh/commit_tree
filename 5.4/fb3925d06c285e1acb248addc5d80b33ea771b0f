KVM: X86: Use IPI shorthands in kvm guest when support

IPI shorthand is supported now by linux apic/x2apic driver, switch to
IPI shorthand for all excluding self and all including self destination
shorthand in kvm guest, to avoid splitting the target mask into several
PV IPI hypercalls. This patch removes the kvm_send_ipi_all() and
kvm_send_ipi_allbutself() since the callers in APIC codes have already
taken care of apic_use_ipi_shorthand and fallback to ->send_IPI_mask
and ->send_IPI_mask_allbutself if it is false.
