net: phy: remove calls to genphy_config_init

Supported PHY features are either auto-detected or explicitly set.
In both cases calling genphy_config_init isn't needed. All that
genphy_config_init does is removing features that are set as
supported but can't be auto-detected. Basically it duplicates the
code in genphy_read_abilities. Therefore remove such calls from
all PHY drivers.

v2:
- remove call also from new adin PHY driver
v3:
- pass NULL as config_init function pointer for dp83848
