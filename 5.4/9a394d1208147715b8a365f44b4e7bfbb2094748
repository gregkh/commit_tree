fs: cifs: move from the crypto cipher API to the new DES library interface

Some legacy code in the CIFS driver uses single DES to calculate
some password hash, and uses the crypto cipher API to do so. Given
that there is no point in invoking an accelerated cipher for doing
56-bit symmetric encryption on a single 8-byte block of input, the
flexibility of the crypto cipher API does not add much value here,
and so we're much better off using a library call into the generic
C implementation.
