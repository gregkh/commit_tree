drm/i915/uc: Unify uc_fw status tracking

We currently track fetch and load status separately, but the 2 are
actually sequential in the uc lifetime (fetch must complete before we
can attempt the load!). Unifying the 2 variables we can better follow
the sequential states and improve our trackng of the uC state.

Also, sprinkle some GEM_BUG_ON to make sure we transition correctly
between states.

v2: rename states, add the running state (Michal), drop some logs in
    the fetch path (Michal, Chris)

v3: re-rename states, extend early status check to all helpers (Michal)
