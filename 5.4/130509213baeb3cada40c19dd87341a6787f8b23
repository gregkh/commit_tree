net: hns3: fix interrupt clearing error for VF

Currently, VF driver has two kinds of interrupts, reset & CMDQ RX.
For revision 0x21, according to the UM, each interrupt should be
cleared by write 0 to the corresponding bit, but the implementation
writes 0 to the whole register in fact, it will clear other
interrupt at the same time, then the VF will loss the interrupt.
But for revision 0x20, this interrupt clear register is a read &
write register, for compatible, we just keep the old implementation
for 0x20.

This patch fixes it, also, adds a new register for reading the interrupt
status according to hardware user manual.
