scsi: lpfc: Fix discovery when target has no GID_FT information

Some remote ports may be slow in registering their GID_FT protocol
information with the fabric. If the remote port is an initiator, it may
send PLOGI to the port before the GID_FT logic is complete. Meaning, after
accepting the PLOGI, when the driver may see no response to the GID_FT that
is issued after the login to determine the protocols supported so that
proper PRLI's may be transmit. If the driver has no fc4 information, it
currently stops and the remote port is not discovered.

Fix by issuing a LOGO when there is no GID_FT information.  The LOGO
completion handling will attempt to re-login if the nport_id is still
present.
