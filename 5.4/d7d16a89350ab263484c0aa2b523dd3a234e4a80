net: add skb_queue_empty_lockless()

Some paths call skb_queue_empty() without holding
the queue lock. We must use a barrier in order
to not let the compiler do strange things, and avoid
KCSAN splats.

Adding a barrier in skb_queue_empty() might be overkill,
I prefer adding a new helper to clearly identify
points where the callers might be lockless. This might
help us finding real bugs.

The corresponding WRITE_ONCE() should add zero cost
for current compilers.
