MAINTAINERS: Update for INTEL IOMMU (VT-d) entry

Update the INTEL IOMMU (VT-d) entry and add myself as the
co-maintainer. I have several years of VT-d development
experience and have actively contributed to Intel VT-d
driver during recent two years. I volunteer to take this
rule. With this role, I can better help review and test
patches.
