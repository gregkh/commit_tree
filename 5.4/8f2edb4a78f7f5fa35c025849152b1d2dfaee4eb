posix-timers: Unbreak CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS=n build

The rework of the posix-cpu-timers patch series dropped the empty
declaration of struct cpu_timer for the CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS=n case which
causes the build to fail:

./include/linux/posix-timers.h:218:20: error: field 'cpu' has incomplete type

Add it back.
