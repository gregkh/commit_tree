drm/i915: Rename engines to match their user interface

During engine setup, we may find that some engines are fused off causing
a misalignment between internal names and the instances seen by users,
e.g. (I915_ENGINE_CLASS_VIDEO_DECODE, 1) may be vcs2 in hardware.
Normally this is invisible to the user, but a few debug interfaces (and
our own internal tracing) use the original HW name not the name the user
would expect as formed from their class:instance tuple. Replace our
internal name with the uabi name for consistency with, for example, error
states.

v2: Keep the pretty printing of class name in the selftest
