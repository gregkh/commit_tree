uio: uio_pdrv_genirq: Make UIO name controllable via DT node property

When probed via DT, the uio_pdrv_genirq driver currently uses the name
of the node and exposes that as name of the UIO device to userspace.

This doesn't work for systems where multiple nodes with the same name
(but different unit addresses) are present, or for systems where the
node names are auto-generated by a third-party tool.

This patch adds the possibility to read the UIO name from the optional
"linux,uio-name" property.
