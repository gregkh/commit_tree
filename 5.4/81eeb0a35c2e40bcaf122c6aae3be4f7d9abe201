regulator: core: Add label to collate of_node_put() statements

In function of_get_child_regulator(), the loop for_each_child_of_node()
contains two mid-loop return statements, each preceded by a statement
putting child. In order to reduce this repetition, create a new label,
err_node_put, that puts child and then returns the required value;
edit the mid-loop return blocks to instead go to this new label.
