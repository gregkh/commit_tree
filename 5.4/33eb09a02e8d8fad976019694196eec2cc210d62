i2c: designware: make use of devm_gpiod_get_optional

There is a semantical change: if devm_gpiod_get_optional returns -ENOSYS
this is passed as error to the caller. This effectively reverts commit
d1fa74520dcd ("i2c: designware: Consider SCL GPIO optional") which
shouldn't be necessary any more since gpiod_get_optional doesn't return
-ENOSYS any more with GPIOLIB=n.
