drm/komeda: Fix potential integer overflow in komeda_crtc_update_clock_ratio

Add suffix ULL to constant 1000 in order to avoid a potential integer
overflow and give the compiler complete information about the proper
arithmetic to use. Notice that this constant is being used in a context
that expects an expression of type u64, but it's currently evaluated
using 32-bit arithmetic.

Addresses-Coverity-ID: 1485796 ("Unintentional integer overflow")
Fixes: ed22c6d9304d ("drm/komeda: Use drm_display_mode "crtc_" prefixed hardware timings")
