drm/i915: Track ggtt fence reservations under its own mutex

We can reduce the locking for fence registers from the dev->struct_mutex
to a local mutex. We could introduce a mutex for the sole purpose of
tracking the fence acquisition, except there is a little bit of overlap
with the fault tracking, so use the i915_ggtt.mutex as it covers both.
