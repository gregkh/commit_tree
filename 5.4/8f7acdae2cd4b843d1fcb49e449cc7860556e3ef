staging: erofs: kill all failure handling in fill_super()

.kill_sb() will do that instead in order to remove duplicated code.

Note that the initialzation of managed_cache is now moved
after s_root is assigned since it's more preferred to iput()
in .put_super() and all inodes should be evicted before
the end of generic_shutdown_super(sb).
