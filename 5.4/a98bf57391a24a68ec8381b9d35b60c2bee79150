tools: bpftool: add support for reporting the effective cgroup progs

Takshak said in the original submission:

With different bpf attach_flags available to attach bpf programs specially
with BPF_F_ALLOW_OVERRIDE and BPF_F_ALLOW_MULTI, the list of effective
bpf-programs available to any sub-cgroups really needs to be available for
easy debugging.

Using BPF_F_QUERY_EFFECTIVE flag, one can get the list of not only attached
bpf-programs to a cgroup but also the inherited ones from parent cgroup.

So a new option is introduced to use BPF_F_QUERY_EFFECTIVE query flag here
to list all the effective bpf-programs available for execution at a specified
cgroup.

Reused modified test program test_cgroup_attach from tools/testing/selftests/bpf:
  # ./test_cgroup_attach

With old bpftool:

 # bpftool cgroup show /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup-test-work-dir/cg1/
  ID       AttachType      AttachFlags     Name
  271      egress          multi           pkt_cntr_1
  272      egress          multi           pkt_cntr_2

Attached new program pkt_cntr_4 in cg2 gives following:

 # bpftool cgroup show /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup-test-work-dir/cg1/cg2
  ID       AttachType      AttachFlags     Name
  273      egress          override        pkt_cntr_4

And with new "effective" option it shows all effective programs for cg2:

 # bpftool cgroup show /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup-test-work-dir/cg1/cg2 effective
  ID       AttachType      AttachFlags     Name
  273      egress          override        pkt_cntr_4
  271      egress          override        pkt_cntr_1
  272      egress          override        pkt_cntr_2

Compared to original submission use a local flag instead of global
option.

We need to clear query_flags on every command, in case batch mode
wants to use varying settings.

v2: (Takshak)
 - forbid duplicated flags;
 - fix cgroup path freeing.
