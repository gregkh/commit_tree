powerpc/64s/radix: Fix memory hotplug section page table creation

create_physical_mapping expects physical addresses, but creating and
splitting these mappings after boot is supplying virtual (effective)
addresses. This can be irritated by booting with mem= to limit memory
then probing an unused physical memory range:

  echo <addr> > /sys/devices/system/memory/probe

This mostly works by accident, firstly because __va(__va(x)) == __va(x)
so the virtual address does not get corrupted. Secondly because pfn_pte
masks out the upper bits of the pfn beyond the physical address limit,
so a pfn constructed with a 0xc000000000000000 virtual linear address
will be masked back to the correct physical address in the pte.
