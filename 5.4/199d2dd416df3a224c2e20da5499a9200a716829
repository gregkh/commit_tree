net: hns3: make some reusable codes into a function

In hclge_dcb.c, these pair of codes:
	hclge_notify_client(hdev, HNAE3_DOWN_CLIENT);
	hclge_notify_client(hdev, HNAE3_UNINIT_CLIENT);
and
	hclge_notify_client(hdev, HNAE3_INIT_CLIENT);
	hclge_notify_client(hdev, HNAE3_UP_CLIENT);
are called many times, so make them into a function.
