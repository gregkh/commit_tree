tcp: increase tcp_max_syn_backlog max value

tcp_max_syn_backlog default value depends on memory size
and TCP ehash size. Before this patch, the max value
was 2048 [1], which is considered too small nowadays.

Increase it to 4096 to match the recent SOMAXCONN change.

[1] This is with TCP ehash size being capped to 524288 buckets.
