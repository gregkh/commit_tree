ARM: OMAP2+: Fix missing reset done flag for am3 and am43

For ti,sysc-omap4 compatible devices with no sysstatus register, we do have
reset done status available in the SOFTRESET bit that clears when the reset
is done. This is documented for example in am437x TRM for DMTIMER_TIOCP_CFG
register. The am335x TRM just says that SOFTRESET bit value 1 means reset is
ongoing, but it behaves the same way clearing after reset is done.

With the ti-sysc driver handling this automatically based on no sysstatus
register defined, we see warnings if SYSC_HAS_RESET_STATUS is missing in the
legacy platform data:

ti-sysc 48042000.target-module: sysc_flags 00000222 != 00000022
ti-sysc 48044000.target-module: sysc_flags 00000222 != 00000022
ti-sysc 48046000.target-module: sysc_flags 00000222 != 00000022
...

Let's fix these warnings by adding SYSC_HAS_RESET_STATUS. Let's also
remove the useless parentheses while at it.

If it turns out we do have ti,sysc-omap4 compatible devices without a
working SOFTRESET bit we can set up additional quirk handling for it.
