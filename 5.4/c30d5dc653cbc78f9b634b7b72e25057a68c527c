drm/i915/gt: Push engine stopping into reset-prepare

Push the engine stop into the back reset_prepare (where it already was!)
This allows us to avoid dangerously setting the RING registers to 0 for
logical contexts. If we clear the register on a live context, those
invalid register values are recorded in the logical context state and
replayed (with hilarious results).
