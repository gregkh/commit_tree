watchdog: cpwd: use generic compat_ptr_ioctl

The cpwd_compat_ioctl() contains a bogus mutex that dates
back to a leftover BKL instance.

Simplify the implementation by using the new compat_ptr_ioctl()
helper function that will do the right thing for all calls
here.

Note that WIOCSTART/WIOCSTOP don't take any arguments, so
the compat_ptr() conversion is not needed here, but it also
doesn't hurt.
