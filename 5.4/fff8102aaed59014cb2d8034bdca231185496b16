drm/i915/execlists: Process interrupted context on reset

By stopping the rings, we may trigger an arbitration point resulting in
a premature context-switch (i.e. a completion event before the request
is actually complete). This clears the active context before the reset,
but we must remember to rewind the incomplete context for replay upon
resume.
