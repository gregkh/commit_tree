Revert "ALSA: hda: Add codec on bus address table lately"

This reverts commit ee5f85d9290f ("ALSA: hda: Add codec on bus address
table lately").  The commit caused several regression since I've
overlooked that the function doesn't manage only the caddr_tbl but
also the codec linked list that is referred indirectly in the other
drivers.

Revert for now to make everything back to work.
