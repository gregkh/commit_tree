ice: Set WB_ON_ITR when we don't re-enable interrupts

Currently when busy polling is enabled we aren't setting/enabling
WB_ON_ITR in the driver. This doesn't break the driver, but it does
cause issues. If we don't enable WB_ON_ITR mode we will still get
write-backs from hardware during polling when a cache line has been
filled, but if a cache line is not filled we will not get the
write-back because WB_ON_ITR is not set. Fix this by enabling
WB_ON_ITR in the driver when interrupts are disabled.
