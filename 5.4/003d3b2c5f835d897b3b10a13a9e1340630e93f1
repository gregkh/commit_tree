PCI: Make pci_hotplug_io_size, mem_size, and bus_size private

These symbols:

  extern unsigned long pci_hotplug_io_size;
  extern unsigned long pci_hotplug_mem_size;
  extern unsigned long pci_hotplug_bus_size;

are only used in drivers/pci/ and do not need to be seen by the rest of the
kernel.  Move them to drivers/pci/pci.h so they're private to the PCI
subsystem.
