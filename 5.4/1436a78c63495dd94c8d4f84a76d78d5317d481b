iio: light: fix vcnl4000 devicetree hooks

Since commit ebd457d55911 ("iio: light: vcnl4000 add devicetree hooks")
the of_match_table is supported but the data shouldn't be a string.
Instead it shall be one of 'enum vcnl4000_device_ids'. Also the matching
logic for the vcnl4020 was wrong. Since the data retrieve mechanism is
still based on the i2c_device_id no failures did appeared till now.
