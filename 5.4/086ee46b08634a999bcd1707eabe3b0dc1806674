timers/sched_clock: Include local timekeeping.h for missing declarations

Include the timekeeping.h header to get the declaration of the
sched_clock_{suspend,resume} functions. Fixes the following sparse
warnings:

kernel/time/sched_clock.c:275:5: warning: symbol 'sched_clock_suspend' was not declared. Should it be static?
kernel/time/sched_clock.c:286:6: warning: symbol 'sched_clock_resume' was not declared. Should it be static?
