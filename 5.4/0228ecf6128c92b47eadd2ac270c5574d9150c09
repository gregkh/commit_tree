MIPS: octeon: Include required header; fix octeon ethernet build

Commit 171a9bae68c7 ("staging/octeon: Allow test build on !MIPS") moved
the inclusion of a bunch of headers by various files in the Octeon
ethernet driver into a common header, but in doing so it changed the
order in which those headers are included.

Prior to the referenced commit drivers/staging/octeon/ethernet.c
included asm/octeon/cvmx-pip.h before asm/octeon/cvmx-ipd.h, which makes
use of the CVMX_PIP_SFT_RST definition pulled in by the former. After
commit 171a9bae68c7 ("staging/octeon: Allow test build on !MIPS") we
pull in asm/octeon/cvmx-ipd.h first & builds fail with:

  In file included from drivers/staging/octeon/octeon-ethernet.h:27,

Fix this by having asm/octeon/cvmx-ipd.h include the
asm/octeon/cvmx-pip-defs.h header that it is reliant upon, rather than
requiring its users to pull in that header before it.
