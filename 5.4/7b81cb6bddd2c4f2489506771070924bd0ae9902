usb: add a HCD_DMA flag instead of guestimating DMA capabilities

The usb core is the only major place in the kernel that checks for
a non-NULL device dma_mask to see if a device is DMA capable.  This
is generally a bad idea, as all major busses always set up a DMA mask,
even if the device is not DMA capable - in fact bus layers like PCI
can't even know if a device is DMA capable at enumeration time.  This
leads to lots of workaround in HCD drivers, and also prevented us from
setting up a DMA mask for platform devices by default last time we
tried.

Replace this guess with an explicit HCD_DMA that is set by drivers that
appear to have DMA support.
