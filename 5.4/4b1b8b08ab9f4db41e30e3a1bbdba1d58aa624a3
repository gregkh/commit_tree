staging: wilc1000: merge drv_handle and operation_mode wids

wilc_set_wfi_drv_handler and wilc_set_operation_mode sends the same
parameters to the FW, so it's better to combine them together.

Kept wilc_set_wfi_drv_handler implementation since it sends all the
required parameters, and renamed it to wilc_set_operation_mode to be
more descriptive.
