hugetlbfs: don't access uninitialized memmaps in pfn_range_valid_gigantic()

Uninitialized memmaps contain garbage and in the worst case trigger
kernel BUGs, especially with CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING.  They should not get
touched.

Let's make sure that we only consider online memory (managed by the
buddy) that has initialized memmaps.  ZONE_DEVICE is not applicable.

page_zone() will call page_to_nid(), which will trigger
VM_BUG_ON_PGFLAGS(PagePoisoned(page), page) with CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING
and CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGFLAGS when called on uninitialized memmaps.  This
can be the case when an offline memory block (e.g., never onlined) is
spanned by a zone.

Note: As explained by Michal in [1], alloc_contig_range() will verify
the range.  So it boils down to the wrong access in this function.
