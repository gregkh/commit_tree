drm/i915: Compartmentalize i915_gem_init_ggtt

Continuing on the theme of better logical organization of our code, make
the first step towards making the ggtt code better isolated from wider
struct drm_i915_private.

v2:
 * Bring the ickle onion unwind back. (Chris)
 * Rename to i915_init_ggtt. (Chris)
