fuse: on 64-bit store time in d_fsdata directly

Implements the optimization noted in commit f75fdf22b0a8 ("fuse: don't
use ->d_time"), as the additional memory can be significant.  (In
particular, on SLAB configurations this 8-byte alloc becomes 32 bytes).
Per-dentry, this can consume significant memory.
