of/platform: Don't create device links for default busses

Default busses also have devices created for them. But there's no point
in creating device links for them. It's especially wasteful as it'll
cause the traversal of the entire device tree and also spend a lot of
time checking and figuring out that creating those links isn't allowed.
So check for default busses and skip trying to create device links for
them.
