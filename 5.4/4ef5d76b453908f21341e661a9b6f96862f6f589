ARM: dts: Fix gpio0 flags for am335x-icev2

The ti,no-idle-on-init and ti,no-reset-on-init flags need to be at
the interconnect target module level for the modules that have it
defined. Otherwise we get the following warnings:

dts flag should be at module level for ti,no-idle-on-init
dts flag should be at module level for ti,no-reset-on-init
