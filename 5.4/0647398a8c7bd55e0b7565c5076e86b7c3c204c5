mm: kmemleak: simple memory allocation pool for kmemleak objects

Add a memory pool for struct kmemleak_object in case the normal
kmem_cache_alloc() fails under the gfp constraints passed by the caller.
The mem_pool[] array size is currently fixed at 16000.

We are not using the existing mempool kernel API since this requires
the slab allocator to be available (for pool->elements allocation).  A
subsequent kmemleak patch will replace the static early log buffer with
the pool allocation introduced here and this functionality is required
to be available before the slab was initialised.
