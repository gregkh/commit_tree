PM / Domains: Verify PM domain type in dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state()

The dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state() could in principle be called for a
device that has a different PM domain type attached than a genpd. This
would lead to a problem as dev_to_genpd() uses the container_of macro.

Address this problem by using dev_to_genpd_safe() instead.
