ALSA: firewire-lib: add syt_override member for some protocols

Some protocols don't use syt field of CIP header to represent
presentation timestamp. For such protocol, ALSA IEC 61883-1/6
packet streaming engine uses a pointer into local variable for
the value of syt to call data block processing layer. However,
it can decide the value when initializing packet streaming
layer.

This commit adds 'syt_override' member for packet streaming
layer.
