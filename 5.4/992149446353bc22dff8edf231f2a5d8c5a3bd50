ice: Don't return error for disabling LAN Tx queue that does exist

Since Tx rings are being managed by FW/NVM, Tx rings might have not been
set up or driver had already wiped them off - In that case, call to
disable LAN Tx queue is being returned as not in existence. This patch
makes sure we don't return unnecessary error for such scenario.
