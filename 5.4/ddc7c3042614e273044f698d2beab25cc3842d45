libbpf: implement BPF CO-RE offset relocation algorithm

This patch implements the core logic for BPF CO-RE offsets relocations.
Every instruction that needs to be relocated has corresponding
bpf_offset_reloc as part of BTF.ext. Relocations are performed by trying
to match recorded "local" relocation spec against potentially many
compatible "target" types, creating corresponding spec. Details of the
algorithm are noted in corresponding comments in the code.
