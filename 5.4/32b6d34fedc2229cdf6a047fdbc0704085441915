net: core: add ignore flag to netdev_adjacent structure

In order to link an adjacent node, netdev_upper_dev_link() is used
and in order to unlink an adjacent node, netdev_upper_dev_unlink() is used.
unlink operation does not fail, but link operation can fail.

In order to exchange adjacent nodes, we should unlink an old adjacent
node first. then, link a new adjacent node.
If link operation is failed, we should link an old adjacent node again.
But this link operation can fail too.
It eventually breaks the adjacent link relationship.

This patch adds an ignore flag into the netdev_adjacent structure.
If this flag is set, netdev_upper_dev_link() ignores an old adjacent
node for a moment.

This patch also adds new functions for other modules.
netdev_adjacent_change_prepare()
netdev_adjacent_change_commit()
netdev_adjacent_change_abort()

netdev_adjacent_change_prepare() inserts new device into adjacent list
but new device is not allowed to use immediately.
If netdev_adjacent_change_prepare() fails, it internally rollbacks
adjacent list so that we don't need any other action.
netdev_adjacent_change_commit() deletes old device in the adjacent list
and allows new device to use.
netdev_adjacent_change_abort() rollbacks adjacent list.
