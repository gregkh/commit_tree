libnvdimm, region: Use struct_size() in kzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct nd_region {
	...
        struct nd_mapping mapping[0];
};

instance = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nd_region) + sizeof(struct nd_mapping) *
                          count, GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = kzalloc(struct_size(instance, mapping, count), GFP_KERNEL);

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
