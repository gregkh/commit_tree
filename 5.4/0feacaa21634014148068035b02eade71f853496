writeback: don't access page->mapping directly in track_foreign_dirty TP

page->mapping may encode different values in it and page_mapping()
should always be used to access the mapping pointer.
track_foreign_dirty tracepoint was incorrectly accessing page->mapping
directly.  Use page_mapping() instead.  Also, add NULL checks while at
it.
