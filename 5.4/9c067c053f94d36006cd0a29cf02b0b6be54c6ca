scsi: mpt3sas: Handle fault during HBA initialization

During HBA initialization time, if handshake operation fails due to some
firmware fault then currently driver is terminating the HBA
initialization. It is possible that HBA may come up properly if diag reset
is issued.

So improvement is made in driver in such a way that before terminating the
HBA initialization, driver checks the IOC state and if IOC state is in
fault state then issue diag reset for once. If diag reset is successful
then continue with HBA initialization else terminate the HBA
initialization.
