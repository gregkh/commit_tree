KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix incorrect guest-to-user-translation error handling

H_PUT_TCE_INDIRECT handlers receive a page with up to 512 TCEs from
a guest. Although we verify correctness of TCEs before we do anything
with the existing tables, there is a small window when a check in
kvmppc_tce_validate might pass and right after that the guest alters
the page with TCEs which can cause early exit from the handler and
leave srcu_read_lock(&vcpu->kvm->srcu) (virtual mode) or lock_rmap(rmap)
(real mode) locked.

This fixes the bug by jumping to the common exit code with an appropriate
unlock.
