net: hns3: add check for max TX BD num for tso and non-tso case

Hardware supports up to 8 TX BD for non-TSO skb and 63 TX
BD for TSO skb. Currently hns3 driver does not check the max
BD num that required by a skb before filling desc, which may
cause the hardware to issue a RAS error throug PCIe AER.

This patch adds the max BD num check before filling desc,
if the bd num is not within the hardware limit, it will
record the error by ring->stats.sw_err_cnt counter and
free the skb.

This patch also cleans up the hns3_nic_bd_num function by
changing the return type and removing an unnecessary check.
