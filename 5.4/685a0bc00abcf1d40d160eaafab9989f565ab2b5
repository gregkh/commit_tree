powerpc/eeh: Initialize EEH address cache earlier

The EEH address cache is currently initialized and populated by a
single function: eeh_addr_cache_build().  While the initial population
of the cache can only be done once resources are allocated,
initialization (just setting up a spinlock) could be done much
earlier.

So move the initialization step into a separate function and call it
from a core_initcall (rather than a subsys initcall).

This will allow future work to make use of the cache during boot time
PCI scanning.
