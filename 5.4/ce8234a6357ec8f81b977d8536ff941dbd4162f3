ASoC: SOF: Introduce snd_sof_dsp_get_bar_index ops

FW encapsulates information about section types (e.g DRAM, IRAM)
inside module block header. This information can be used in order
to correctly load the section to the appropriate place in memory.

SOF Linux driver needs to know for each platform how to map the
section type with the corresponding memory BAR. So, this patch
introduces get_bar_index, a new operation inside snd_sof_dsp_ops.

Intel platforms, usually load all the section in a contiguous memory
area (usually denoted by sdev->mmio_bar) so things are relatively
simple there. Anyhow, on i.MX8 IRAM and DRAM for example are mapped
to distinct BARs.

By default, if no get_bar function is provided the core implementation
will always return sdev->mmio_bar so that there will be no need for
a change to existing Intel code.
