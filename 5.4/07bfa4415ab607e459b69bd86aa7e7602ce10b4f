fat: work around race with userspace's read via blockdev while mounting

If userspace reads the buffer via blockdev while mounting,
sb_getblk()+modify can race with buffer read via blockdev.

For example,

            FS                               userspace
    bh = sb_getblk()
    modify bh->b_data
                                  read
				    ll_rw_block(bh)
				      fill bh->b_data by on-disk data
				      /* lost modified data by FS */
				      set_buffer_uptodate(bh)
    set_buffer_uptodate(bh)

Userspace should not use the blockdev while mounting though, the udev
seems to be already doing this.  Although I think the udev should try to
avoid this, workaround the race by small overhead.
