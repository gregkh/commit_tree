arm64: KVM: Device mappings should be execute-never

Since commit 2f6ea23f63cca ("arm64: KVM: Avoid marking pages as XN in
Stage-2 if CTR_EL0.DIC is set"), KVM has stopped marking normal memory
as execute-never at stage2 when the system supports D->I Coherency at
the PoU. This avoids KVM taking a trap when the page is first executed,
in order to clean it to PoU.

The patch that added this change also wrapped PAGE_S2_DEVICE mappings
up in this too. The upshot is, if your CPU caches support DIC ...
you can execute devices.

Revert the PAGE_S2_DEVICE change so PTE_S2_XN is always used
directly.
