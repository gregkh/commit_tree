USB: iowarrior: drop redundant iowarrior mutex

Drop the redundant iowarrior mutex introduced by commit 925ce689bb31
("USB: autoconvert trivial BKL users to private mutex") which replaced
an earlier BKL use.

The lock serialised calls to open() against other open() and ioctl(),
but neither is needed.
