selftests, arm64: add a selftest for passing tagged pointers to kernel

This patch is a part of a series that extends kernel ABI to allow to pass
tagged user pointers (with the top byte set to something else other than
0x00) as syscall arguments.

This patch adds a simple test, that calls the uname syscall with a
tagged user pointer as an argument. Without the kernel accepting tagged
user pointers the test fails with EFAULT.
