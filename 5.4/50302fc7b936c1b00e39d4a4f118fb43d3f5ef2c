soundwire: intel_init: add kernel module parameter to filter out links

The hardware and ACPI info may report the presence of links that are
not physically enabled (e.g. due to pin-muxing or hardware reworks),
which in turn can result in errors being thrown. This shouldn't be the
case for production devices but will happen a lot on development
devices - even more so when they expose a connector.

Even when the ACPI information is correct, it's useful to be able to
only enable the links that need attention - mostly to filter out
dynamic debug messages.

Add a module parameter to filter out such links, e.g. adding the
following config to a file in /etc/modprobe.d will select the second
and third links only.
