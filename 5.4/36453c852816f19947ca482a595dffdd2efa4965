llc: fix sk_buff refcounting in llc_conn_state_process()

If llc_conn_state_process() sees that llc_conn_service() put the skb on
a list, it will drop one fewer references to it.  This is wrong because
the current behavior is that llc_conn_service() never consumes a
reference to the skb.

The code also makes the number of skb references being dropped
conditional on which of ind_prim and cfm_prim are nonzero, yet neither
of these affects how many references are *acquired*.  So there is extra
code that tries to fix this up by sometimes taking another reference.

Remove the unnecessary/broken refcounting logic and instead just add an
skb_get() before the only two places where an extra reference is
actually consumed.
