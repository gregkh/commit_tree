mlxsw: spectrum_flower: Fail in case user specifies multiple mirror actions

The ASIC can only mirror a packet to one port, but when user is trying
to set more than one mirror action, it doesn't fail.

Add a check if more than one mirror action was specified per rule and if so,
fail for not being supported.
