perf evswitch: Move struct to a separate header to use in other tools

Now that we see that the simple userspace-based "slicing" of events
using delimiter events ("markers") works, lets move it to a separate
header to make it available to other tools, next step will be having
the switch on/off check done at the PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE processing
function moved too.
