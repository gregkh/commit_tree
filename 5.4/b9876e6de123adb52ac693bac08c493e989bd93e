KVM: Forbid /dev/kvm being opened by a compat task when CONFIG_KVM_COMPAT=n

On a system without KVM_COMPAT, we prevent IOCTLs from being issued
by a compat task. Although this prevents most silly things from
happening, it can still confuse a 32bit userspace that is able
to open the kvm device (the qemu test suite seems to be pretty
mad with this behaviour).

Take a more radical approach and return a -ENODEV to the compat
task.
