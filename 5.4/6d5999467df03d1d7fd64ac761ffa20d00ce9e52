ice: Do not configure port with no media

The firmware reports an error when trying to configure a port with no
media. Instead of always configuring the port, check for media before
attempting to configure it. In the absence of media, turn off link and
poll for media to become available before re-enabling link.

Move ice_force_phys_link_state() up to avoid forward declaration.
