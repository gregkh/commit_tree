drm/i915: Add support for mandatory cmdparsing

The existing cmdparser for gen7 can be bypassed by specifying
batch_len=0 in the execbuf call. This is safe because bypassing
simply reduces the cmd-set available.

In a later patch we will introduce cmdparsing for gen9, as a
security measure, which must be strictly enforced since without
it we are vulnerable to DoS attacks.

Introduce the concept of 'required' cmd parsing that cannot be
bypassed by submitting zero-length bb's.
