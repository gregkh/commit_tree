net/smc: fix refcounting for non-blocking connect()

If a nonblocking socket is immediately closed after connect(),
the connect worker may not have started. This results in a refcount
problem, since sock_hold() is called from the connect worker.
This patch moves the sock_hold in front of the connect worker
scheduling.
