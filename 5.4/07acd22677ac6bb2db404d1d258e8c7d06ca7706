libperf: Add perf_thread_map struct

Add perf_thread_map struct to libperf.

It's added as a declaration into into:

  include/perf/threadmap.h

which will be included by users.

The perf_thread_map struct definition is added into:

  include/internal/threadmap.h

which is not to be included by users, but shared within perf and
libperf.

We tried the total separation of the perf_thread_map struct in libperf,
but it lead to complications and much bigger changes in perf code, so we
decided to share the declaration.
