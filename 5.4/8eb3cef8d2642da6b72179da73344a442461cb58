dpaa2-eth: Add pause frame support

Starting with firmware version MC10.18.0, we have support for
L2 flow control. Asymmetrical configuration (Rx or Tx only) is
supported, but not pause frame autonegotioation.

Pause frame configuration is done via ethtool. By default, we start
with flow control enabled on both Rx and Tx. Changes are propagated
to hardware through firmware commands, using two flags (PAUSE,
ASYM_PAUSE) to specify Rx and Tx pause configuration, as follows:

PAUSE | ASYM_PAUSE | Rx pause | Tx pause
----------------------------------------
  0   |     0      | disabled | disabled
  0   |     1      | disabled | enabled
  1   |     0      | enabled  | enabled
  1   |     1      | enabled  | disabled

The hardware can automatically send pause frames when the number
of buffers in the pool goes below a predefined threshold. Due to
this, flow control is incompatible with Rx frame queue taildrop
(both mechanisms target the case when processing of ingress
frames can't keep up with the Rx rate; for large frames, the number
of buffers in the pool may never get low enough to trigger pause
frames as long as taildrop is enabled). So we set pause frame
generation and Rx FQ taildrop as mutually exclusive.
