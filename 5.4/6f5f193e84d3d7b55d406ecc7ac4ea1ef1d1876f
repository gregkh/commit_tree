powerpc/opal: add MPIPL interface definitions

MPIPL is Memory Preserving IPL supported from POWER9. This enables the
kernel to reset the system with memory 'preserved'. Also, it supports
copying memory from a source address to some destination address during
MPIPL boot. Add MPIPL interface definitions here to leverage these f/w
features in adding FADump support for PowerNV platform.
