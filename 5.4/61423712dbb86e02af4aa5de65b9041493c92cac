reset: reset-scmi: add missing handle initialisation

scmi_reset_data->handle needs to be initialised at probe, so that it
can be later used to access scmi reset protocol APIs using the same.

Since it was tested with a module that obtained handle elsewhere,
it was missed easily. Add the missing scmi_reset_data->handle
initialisation to fix the issue.
