cpuidle: allow governor switch on cpuidle_register_driver()

The recently introduced haltpoll driver is largely only useful with
haltpoll governor. To allow drivers to associate with a particular idle
behaviour, add a @governor property to 'struct cpuidle_driver' and thus
allow a cpuidle driver to switch to a *preferred* governor on idle driver
registration. We save the previous governor, and when an idle driver is
unregistered we switch back to that.

The @governor can be overridden by cpuidle.governor= boot param or
alternatively be ignored if the governor doesn't exist.
