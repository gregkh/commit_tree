ata/pata_buddha: Probe via modalias instead of initcall

Up until now, the pata_buddha driver would only check for cards on
initcall time. Now, the kernel will call its probe function as soon
as a compatible card is detected.

v7: Removed suppress_bind_attrs that slipped in

v6: Only do the drvdata workaround for X-Surf (remove breaks otherwise)
    Style

v5: Remove module_exit(): There's no good way to handle the X-Surf hack.
    Also include a workaround to save X-Surf's drvdata in case zorro8390
    is active.

v4: Clean up pata_buddha_probe() by using ent->driver_data.
    Support X-Surf via late_initcall()

v3: Clean up devm_*, implement device removal.

v2: Rename 'zdev' to 'z' to make the patch easy to analyse with
    git diff --ignore-space-change
