powerpc/eeh: Refactor around eeh_probe_devices()

Now that EEH support for all devices (on PowerNV and pSeries) is
provided by the pcibios bus add device hooks, eeh_probe_devices() and
eeh_addr_cache_build() are redundant and can be removed.

Move the EEH enabled message into it's own function so that it can be
called from multiple places.

Note that previously on pSeries, useless EEH sysfs files were created
for some devices that did not have EEH support and this change
prevents them from being created.
