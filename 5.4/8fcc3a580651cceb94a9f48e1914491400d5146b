ext4: rework reserved cluster accounting when invalidating pages

The goal of this patch is to remove two references to the buffer delay
bit in ext4_da_page_release_reservation() as part of a larger effort
to remove all such references from ext4.  These two references are
principally used to reduce the reserved block/cluster count when pages
are invalidated as a result of truncating, punching holes, or
collapsing a block range in a file.  The entire function is removed
and replaced with code in ext4_es_remove_extent() that reduces the
reserved count as a side effect of removing a block range from delayed
and not unwritten extents in the extent status tree as is done when
truncating, punching holes, or collapsing ranges.

The code is written to minimize the number of searches descending from
rb tree roots for scalability.
