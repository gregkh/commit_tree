libbpf: Remove getsockopt() check for XDP_OPTIONS

The xsk_socket__create() function fails and returns an error if it cannot
get the XDP_OPTIONS through getsockopt(). However, support for XDP_OPTIONS
was not added until kernel 5.3, so this means that creating XSK sockets
always fails on older kernels.

Since the option is just used to set the zero-copy flag in the xsk struct,
and that flag is not really used for anything yet, just remove the
getsockopt() call until a proper use for it is introduced.
