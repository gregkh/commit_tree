btrfs: rename the btrfs_calc_*_metadata_size helpers

btrfs_calc_trunc_metadata_size differs from trans_metadata_size in that
it doesn't take into account any splitting at the levels, because
truncate will never split nodes.  However truncate _and_ changing will
never split nodes, so rename btrfs_calc_trunc_metadata_size to
btrfs_calc_metadata_size.  Also btrfs_calc_trans_metadata_size is purely
for inserting items, so rename this to btrfs_calc_insert_metadata_size.
Making these clearer will help when I start using them differently in
upcoming patches.
