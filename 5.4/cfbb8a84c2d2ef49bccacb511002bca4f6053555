xhci: Fix NULL pointer dereference in xhci_clear_tt_buffer_complete()

udev stored in ep->hcpriv might be NULL if tt buffer is cleared
due to a halted control endpoint during device enumeration

xhci_clear_tt_buffer_complete is called by hub_tt_work() once it's
scheduled,  and by then usb core might have freed and allocated a
new udev for the next enumeration attempt.
