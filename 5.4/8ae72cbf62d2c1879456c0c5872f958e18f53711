Revert "ipv6: Handle race in addrconf_dad_work"

This reverts commit a3ce2a21bb8969ae27917281244fa91bf5f286d7.

Eric reported tests failings with commit. After digging into it,
the bottom line is that the DAD sequence is not to be messed with.
There are too many cases that are expected to proceed regardless
of whether a device is up.

Revert the patch and I will send a different solution for the
problem Rajendra reported.
