dpaa2: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

Because we don't care about the individual files, we can remove the
stored dentry for the files, as they are not needed to be kept track of
at all.
