of/platform: Fix device_links_supplier_sync_state_resume() warning

In platforms/devices which have CONFIG_OF turned on but don't have a
populated DT, the calls to device_links_supplier_sync_state_pause() and
device_links_supplier_sync_state_resume() can get mismatched. This will
cause a warning during boot. Fix the warning by making sure the calls are
matched even in that case.
