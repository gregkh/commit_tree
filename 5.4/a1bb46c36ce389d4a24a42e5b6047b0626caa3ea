ACPI: processor: Add QoS requests for all CPUs

The _PPC change notifications from the platform firmware are per-CPU,
so acpi_processor_ppc_init() needs to add a frequency QoS request
for each CPU covered by a cpufreq policy to take all of them into
account.

Even though ACPI thermal control of CPUs sets frequency limits
per processor package, it also needs a frequency QoS request for each
CPU in a cpufreq policy in case some of them are taken offline and
the frequency limit needs to be set through the remaining online
ones (this is slightly excessive, because all CPUs covered by one
cpufreq policy will set the same frequency limit through their QoS
requests, but it is not incorrect).

Modify the code in accordance with the above observations.
