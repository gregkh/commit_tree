i40e: check_recovery_mode had wrong if statement

Function check_recovery_mode had wrong if statement.
Now we check proper FWS1B register values, which are responsible for
the recovery mode. Recovery mode has 4 values for x710 and 2 for x722.
That's why we need 6 different flags which are defined in the code.
Now in the if statement, we recognize type of mac address
and register value.
Without those changes driver could show wrong state.
