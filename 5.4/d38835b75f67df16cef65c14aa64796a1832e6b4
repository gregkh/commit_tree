selftests/bpf: test_progs: remove global fail/success counts

Now that we have a global per-test/per-environment state, there
is no longer need to have global fail/success counters (and there
is no need to save/get the diff before/after the test).

Introduce CHECK_FAIL macro (suggested by Andrii) and covert existing tests
to it. CHECK_FAIL uses new test__fail() to record the failure.
