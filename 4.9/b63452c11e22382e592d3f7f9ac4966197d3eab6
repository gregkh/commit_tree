rxrpc: Accesses of rxrpc_local::service need to be RCU managed

struct rxrpc_local->service is marked __rcu - this means that accesses of
it need to be managed using RCU wrappers.  There are two such places in
rxrpc_release_sock() where the value is checked and cleared.  Fix this by
using the appropriate wrappers.
