MIPS: generic: Fix KASLR for generic kernel.

The KASLR code requires that the plat_get_fdt() function return the
address of the device tree, and it must be available early in the boot,
before prom_init() is called. Move the code determining the address of
the device tree into plat_get_fdt, and call that from prom_init().

The fdt pointer will be set up by plat_get_fdt() called from
relocate_kernel initially and once the relocated kernel has started,
prom_init() will use it again to determine the address in the relocated
image.
