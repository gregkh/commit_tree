PCI: pciehp: Return IRQ_NONE when we can't read interrupt status

After 1469d17dd341 ("PCI: pciehp: Handle invalid data when reading from
non-existent devices"), we returned IRQ_HANDLED when we failed to read
interrupt status from the bridge.  I think it's better to return IRQ_NONE,
as we do in other cases where there's no interrupt pending.  This will
facilitate refactoring the loop in pcie_isr(): we'll be able to call the
ISR in a loop as long as it returns IRQ_HANDLED.

Return IRQ_NONE if we couldn't read interrupt status.
