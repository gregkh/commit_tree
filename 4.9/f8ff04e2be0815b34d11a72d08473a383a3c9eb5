lib/debugobjects: export for use in modules

Drivers, or other modules, that use a mixture of objects (especially
objects embedded within other objects) would like to take advantage of
the debugobjects facilities to help catch misuse.  Currently, the
debugobjects interface is only available to builtin drivers and requires
a set of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for use by modules.

I am using the debugobjects in i915.ko to try and catch some invalid
operations on embedded objects.  The problem currently only presents
itself across module unload so forcing i915 to be builtin is not an
option.
