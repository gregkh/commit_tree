drm/i915: Make intel_adjust_tile_offset() work for linear buffers

To make life less surprising we can make intel_adjust_tile_offset()
deal with linear buffers as well. Currently it doesn't seem like there's
a real need for this since only X tiling and NV12 (which would always
be tiled currently) should need it. But I've used it for some debug
hacks already so seems like a reasonable thing to have.
