greybus: operation: fix use-after-free when sending responses

Fix use-after-free when sending responses due to reference imbalance.

Make sure to take a reference to the operation when sending responses.
This reference is dropped in greybus_data_sent when the message has been
sent, while the initial reference is dropped in gb_operation_work after
processing the corresponding request.
