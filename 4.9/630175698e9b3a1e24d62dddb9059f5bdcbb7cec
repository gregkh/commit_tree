greybus: tracing: define events using macros

A tracepoint event is defined with TP_PROTO() and TP_ARGS macros
that match that of the event's class.  A lot of repetition (and
opportunity for inadvertent errors) in tracepoint event definitions
can be eliminated by using a macro.  Define and use class-specific
event definition macros for gb_message and gb_host_device class
events.
