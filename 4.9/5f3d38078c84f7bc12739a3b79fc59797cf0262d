net: qcom/emac: initial ACPI support

Add support for reading addresses, interrupts, and _DSD properties
from ACPI tables, just like with device tree.  The HID for the
EMAC device itself is QCOM8070.  The internal PHY is represented
by a child node with a HID of QCOM8071.

The EMAC also has some complex clock initialization requirements
that are not represented by this patch.  This will be addressed
in a future patch.
