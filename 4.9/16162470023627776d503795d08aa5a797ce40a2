drm/i915: Cleanup i915_param()

Rather than having a separate case for each value where we just return
a hardcoded value = 1, we lump them all together and rely on the awesome
case-fallthrough feature of C.

Fix all feature macros to pass dev_priv instead of dev while at it,
and use INTEL_GEN() instead of INTEL_INFO()->gen.
