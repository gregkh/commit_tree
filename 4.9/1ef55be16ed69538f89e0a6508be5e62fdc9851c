x86/asm: Get rid of __read_cr4_safe()

We use __read_cr4() vs __read_cr4_safe() inconsistently.  On
CR4-less CPUs, all CR4 bits are effectively clear, so we can make
the code simpler and more robust by making __read_cr4() always fix
up faults on 32-bit kernels.

This may fix some bugs on old 486-like CPUs, but I don't have any
easy way to test that.
