k3dma: Fix occasional DMA ERR issue by using proper dma api

After lots of debugging on an occasional DMA ERR issue, I realized
that the desc structures which we point the dma hardware are being
allocated out of regular memory. This means when we fill the desc
structures, that data doesn't always get flushed out to memory by
the time we start the dma transfer, resulting in the dma engine getting
some null values, resulting in a DMA ERR on the first irq.

Thus, this patch adopts mechanism similar to the zx296702_dma of
allocating the desc structures from a dma pool, so the memory caching
rules are properly set to avoid this issue.
