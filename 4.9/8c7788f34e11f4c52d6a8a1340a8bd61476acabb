ASoC: arizona: Add output power up/down delays for speaker path

The later Arizona parts do run write sequences to power up and down the
speaker path as such a delay needs to be inserted into the DAPM sequence
to allow this to run. This patch adds appropriate delays into the
existing coalesced delay scheme.
