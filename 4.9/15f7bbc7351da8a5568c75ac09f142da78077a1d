drm/i915: Only clear the client pointer when tearing down the file

Upon release of the file (i.e. the user calls close(fd)), we decouple
all objects from the client list so that we don't chase the dangling
file_priv. As we always inspect file_priv first, we only need to nullify
that pointer and can safely ignore the list_head.
