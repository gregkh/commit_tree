thp, dax: add thp_get_unmapped_area for pmd mappings

When CONFIG_FS_DAX_PMD is set, DAX supports mmap() using pmd page size.
This feature relies on both mmap virtual address and FS block (i.e.
physical address) to be aligned by the pmd page size.  Users can use
mkfs options to specify FS to align block allocations.  However,
aligning mmap address requires code changes to existing applications for
providing a pmd-aligned address to mmap().

For instance, fio with "ioengine=mmap" performs I/Os with mmap() [1].
It calls mmap() with a NULL address, which needs to be changed to
provide a pmd-aligned address for testing with DAX pmd mappings.
Changing all applications that call mmap() with NULL is undesirable.

Add thp_get_unmapped_area(), which can be called by filesystem's
get_unmapped_area to align an mmap address by the pmd size for a DAX
file.  It calls the default handler, mm->get_unmapped_area(), to find a
range and then aligns it for a DAX file.

The patch is based on Matthew Wilcox's change that allows adding support
of the pud page size easily.
