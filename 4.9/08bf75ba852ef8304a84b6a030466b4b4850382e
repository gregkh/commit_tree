powerpc/mm/hash64: Fix might_have_hea() check

In commit 2b4e3ad8f579 ("powerpc/mm/hash64: Don't test for machine type
to detect HEA special case") we changed the logic in might_have_hea()
to check FW_FEATURE_SPLPAR rather than machine_is(pseries).

However the check was incorrectly negated, leading to crashes on
machines with HEA adapters, such as:

  mm: Hashing failure ! EA=0xd000080080004040 access=0x800000000000000e current=NetworkManager
      trap=0x300 vsid=0x13d349c ssize=1 base psize=2 psize 2 pte=0xc0003cc033e701ae
  Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address 0xd000080080004040
  Call Trace:
    .ehea_create_cq+0x148/0x340 [ehea] (unreliable)
    .ehea_up+0x258/0x1200 [ehea]
    .ehea_open+0x44/0x1a0 [ehea]
    ...

Fix it by removing the negation.
