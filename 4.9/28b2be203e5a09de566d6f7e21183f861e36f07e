block: require write_same and discard requests align to logical block size

Make sure that the offset and length arguments that we're using to
construct WRITE SAME and DISCARD requests are actually aligned to the
logical block size.  Failure to do this causes other errors in other parts
of the block layer or the SCSI layer because disks don't support partial
logical block writes.
