KVM: PPC: Implement kvm_arch_intc_initialized() for PPC

It doesn't make sense to create irqfds for a VM that doesn't have
in-kernel interrupt controller emulation.  There is an existing
interface for architecture code to tell the irqfd code whether or
not any interrupt controller has been initialized, called
kvm_arch_intc_initialized(), so let's implement that for powerpc.
