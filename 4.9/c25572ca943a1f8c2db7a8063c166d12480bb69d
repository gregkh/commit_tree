greybus: introduce gb_operation_request_send_sync()

Define a new function used to initiate a synchronous operation.
It sends the operation request message and doesn't return until
the response has been received and/or the operation's result
has been set.

This gets rid of the convention that a null callback pointer
signifies a synchronous operation.
