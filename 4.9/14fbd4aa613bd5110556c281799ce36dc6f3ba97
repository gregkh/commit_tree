ext4: enforce online defrag restriction for encrypted files

Online defragging of encrypted files is not currently implemented.
However, the move extent ioctl can still return successfully when
called.  For example, this occurs when xfstest ext4/020 is run on an
encrypted file system, resulting in a corrupted test file and a
corresponding test failure.

Until the proper functionality is implemented, fail the move extent
ioctl if either the original or donor file is encrypted.
