rxrpc: Make IPv6 support conditional on CONFIG_IPV6

Add CONFIG_AF_RXRPC_IPV6 and make the IPv6 support code conditional on it.
This is then made conditional on CONFIG_IPV6.

Without this, the following can be seen:

   net/built-in.o: In function `rxrpc_init_peer':
>> peer_object.c:(.text+0x18c3c8): undefined reference to `ip6_route_output_flags'
