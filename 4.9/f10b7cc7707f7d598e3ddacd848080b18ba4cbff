net/mlx5e: Have a clear separation between different SQ types

Make a clear separate between Regular SQ (TXQ) and ICO SQ creation,
destruction and union their mutual information structures.

Don't allocate redundant TXQ skb/wqe_info/dma_fifo arrays for ICO SQ.
And have a different SQ edge for ICO SQ than TXQ SQ, to be more
accurate.

In preparation for XDP TX support.
