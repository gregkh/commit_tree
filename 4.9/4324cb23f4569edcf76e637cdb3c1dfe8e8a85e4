Kbuild: enable -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings by default

Previously the warnings were added back at the W=1 level and above, this
now turns them on again by default, assuming that we have addressed all
warnings and again have a clean build for v4.10.

I found a number of new warnings in linux-next already and submitted
bugfixes for those.  Hopefully they are caught by the 0day builder in
the future as soon as this patch is merged.
