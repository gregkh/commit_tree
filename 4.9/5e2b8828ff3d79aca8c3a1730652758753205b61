fuse: invalidate dir dentry after chmod

Without "default_permissions" the userspace filesystem's lookup operation
needs to perform the check for search permission on the directory.

If directory does not allow search for everyone (this is quite rare) then
userspace filesystem has to set entry timeout to zero to make sure
permissions are always performed.

Changing the mode bits of the directory should also invalidate the
(previously cached) dentry to make sure the next lookup will have a chance
of updating the timeout, if needed.
