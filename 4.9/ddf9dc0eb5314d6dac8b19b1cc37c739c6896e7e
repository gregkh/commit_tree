vfio-pci: Virtualize PCIe & AF FLR

We use a BAR restore trick to try to detect when a user has performed
a device reset, possibly through FLR or other backdoors, to put things
back into a working state.  This is important for backdoor resets, but
we can actually just virtualize the "front door" resets provided via
PCIe and AF FLR.  Set these bits as virtualized + writable, allowing
the default write to set them in vconfig, then we can simply check the
bit, perform an FLR of our own, and clear the bit.  We don't actually
have the granularity in PCI to specify the type of reset we want to
do, but generally devices don't implement both PCIe and AF FLR and
we'll favor these over other types of reset, so we should generally
lineup.  We do test whether the device provides the requested FLR type
to stay consistent with hardware capabilities though.

This seems to fix several instance of devices getting into bad states
with userspace drivers, like dpdk, running inside a VM.
