sysctl: Stop implicitly passing current into sysctl_table_root.lookup

Passing nsproxy into sysctl_table_root.lookup was a premature
optimization in attempt to avoid depending on current.  The
directory /proc/self/sys has not appeared and if and when
it does this code will need to be reviewed closely and reworked
anyway.  So remove the premature optimization.
