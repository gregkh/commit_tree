net: pktgen: fix pkt_size

The commit 879c7220e828 ("net: pktgen: Observe needed_headroom
of the device") increased the 'pkt_overhead' field value by
LL_RESERVED_SPACE.
As a side effect the generated packet size, computed as:

	/* Eth + IPh + UDPh + mpls */
	datalen = pkt_dev->cur_pkt_size - 14 - 20 - 8 -
		  pkt_dev->pkt_overhead;

is decreased by the same value.
The above changed slightly the behavior of existing pktgen users,
and made the procfs interface somewhat inconsistent.
Fix it by restoring the previous pkt_overhead value and using
LL_RESERVED_SPACE as extralen in skb allocation.
Also, change pktgen_alloc_skb() to only partially reserve
the headroom to allow the caller to prefetch from ll header
start.

v1 -> v2:
 - fixed some typos in the comments
