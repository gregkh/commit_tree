rxrpc: Fix the basic transmit DATA packet content size at 1412 bytes

Fix the basic transmit DATA packet content size at 1412 bytes so that they
can be arbitrarily assembled into jumbo packets.

In the future, I'm thinking of moving to keeping a jumbo packet header at
the beginning of each packet in the Tx queue and creating the packet header
on the spot when kernel_sendmsg() is invoked.  That way, jumbo packets can
be assembled on the spur of the moment for (re-)transmission.
