flow_dissector: Get vlan priority in addition to vlan id

Add vlan priority check to the flow dissector by adding new flow
dissector struct, flow_dissector_key_vlan which includes vlan tag
fields.

vlan_id and flow_label fields were under the same struct
(flow_dissector_key_tags). It was a convenient setting since struct
flow_dissector_key_tags is used by struct flow_keys and by setting
vlan_id and flow_label under the same struct, we get precisely 24 or 48
bytes in flow_keys from flow_dissector_key_basic.

Now, when adding vlan priority support, the code will be cleaner if
flow_label and vlan tag won't be under the same struct anymore.
