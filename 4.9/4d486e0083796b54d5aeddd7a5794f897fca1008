soc/fsl/qe: fix Oops on CPM1 (and likely CPM2)

Commit 0e6e01ff694ee ("CPM/QE: use genalloc to manage CPM/QE muram")
has changed the way muram is managed.
genalloc uses kmalloc(), hence requires the SLAB to be up and running.

On powerpc 8xx, cpm_reset() is called early during startup.
cpm_reset() then calls cpm_muram_init() before SLAB is available,
hence the following Oops.

cpm_reset() cannot be called during initcalls because the CPM is
needed for console.

This patch removes the call to cpm_muram_init() from cpm_reset().
cpm_muram_init() will be called from a new function called cpm_init()
which is declared as subsys_initcall, unless cpm_muram_alloc() is
called earlier for the serial console in which case cpm_muram_init()
will be called from there.

The reason for calling it from two places is that some drivers
(e.g. i2c-cpm) need some of the initialisations done by
cpm_muram_init() but don't call cpm_muram_alloc(). The console
driver calls cpm_muram_alloc() but some platforms might not use
the CPM serial ports for console.
