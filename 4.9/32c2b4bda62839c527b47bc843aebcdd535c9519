drm/i915: Avoid incrementing hangcheck whilst waiting for external fence

If we are waiting upon an external fence, from the pov of hangcheck the
engine is stuck on the last submitted seqno. Currently we give a small
increment to the hangcheck score in order to catch a stuck waiter /
driver. Now that we both have an independent wait hangcheck and may be
stuck waiting on an external fence, resetting the GPU has little effect
on that external fence. As we cannot advance by resetting, skip
incrementing the hangcheck score.
