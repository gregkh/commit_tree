usb: renesas_usbhs: add wait after initialization for R-Car Gen3

Since the controller on R-Car Gen3 doesn't have any status registers
to detect initialization (LPSTS.SUSPM = 1) and the initialization needs
up to 45 usec, this patch adds wait after the initialization. Otherwise,
writing other registers (e.g. INTENB0) will fail.
