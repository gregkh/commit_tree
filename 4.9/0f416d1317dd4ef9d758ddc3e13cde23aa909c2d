Revert "ARM: dts: am33xx: Move to operating-points-v2 table and ti-cpufreq driver"

This reverts commit 4317be1162108bcdf50dc53dfb48eac94dcff25c.

The original commit updated the cpufreq operating points tables for
am33xx but was merged before the driver making use of the node was
merged, which breaks the existing cpufreq implementation on the system,
so revert the patch until the ti-cpufreq driver is merged.
