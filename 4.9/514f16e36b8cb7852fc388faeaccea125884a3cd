scsi: hisi_sas: remove init_id_frame_v2_hw()

Function config_id_frame_v2_hw() is called twice for each PHY during
initialisation, which is unneeded.

So remove init_id_frame_v2_hw(), which only calls
config_id_frame_v2_hw().

We will keep the call to config_id_frame_v2_hw() in start_phy_v2_hw()
since it will be used for PHY reset functions.
