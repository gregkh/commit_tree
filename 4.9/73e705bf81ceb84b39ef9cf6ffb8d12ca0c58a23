regulator: core: Add set_voltage_time op

The new op is analogous to set_voltage_time_sel. It can be used by
regulators which don't have a table of discrete voltages. The function
returns the time for the regulator output voltage to stabilize after
being set to a new value, in microseconds. If the op is not set a
default implementation is used to calculate the delay.

This change also removes the ramp_delay calculation in the PWM
regulator, since the driver now uses the core code for the calculation
of the delay.
