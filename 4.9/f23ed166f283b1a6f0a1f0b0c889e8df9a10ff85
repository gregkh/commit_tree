powerpc/64s: Fix system reset interrupt winkle wakeups

Wakeups from winkle set the low bit of the HSPRG0 register, to
distinguish it from other sleep states. This is also the PACA pointer.
The system reset exception handler fails to mask this bit away before
using this value before using it as the PACA pointer.

Fix this by adding a new type of exception prolog macro where we already
have the PACA set in r13, and have the system reset vector mask it out.
The winkle wakeup handler will store the masked value back into HSPRG0.
