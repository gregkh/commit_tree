greybus: Fixup __u64, __u32 to __le64, __le32 in timesync declarations

A number of data in TimeSync command structures are declared __u64/__u32
instead of __le64/__le32, I forgot to put this through an x86_64 compile
before presentation for merge and as a result didn't catch this error. This
patch fixes.
