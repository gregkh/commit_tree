greybus: arche-platform: Control usb3613 from arche-platform

USB3613 hub driver exports control function, which allows caller
to switch the mode of operation of hub device.
As we know that, we have dependency between HUB3613 and APB's where,
HUB supposed to enter into HUB only after APB's brought out of reset.

Until now, we had all userspace driver sequences to control this,
but now since we are moving all resource management strictly to the
driver, it makes sense (even though it looks hacky) to enable control
of hub3613 from arche-platform driver.

Note that, there is another discussion where, the hub.connect IO pin may
get interfaced with MSM gpio, at that time, we can get rid of this hack
and replace it with gpio control.

Testing Done: Tested on EVT1.2 and DB3.5 platform.
