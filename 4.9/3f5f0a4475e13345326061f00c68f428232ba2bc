MIPS: generic: Convert SEAD-3 to a generic board

Convert the MIPS SEAD-3 board support to be a generic board, supported
by generic kernels.

Because the SEAD-3 boot protocol was defined long ago and we don't want
to force a switch to the UHI protocol, SEAD-3 is added as a legacy board
which is detected by reading the REVISION register. This may technically
not be a valid memory read & future work will include attempting to
handle that gracefully. In practice since SEAD-3 is the only legacy
board supported by the generic kernel so far the read will only happen
on SEAD-3 boards, and even once Malta is converted the same REVISION
register exists there too. Other boards such as Boston, Ci20 & Ci40 will
use the UHI boot protocol & thus not run any of the legacy board detect
functions.
