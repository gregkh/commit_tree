thread_info: Use unsigned long for flags

The generic THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK definition of thread_info::flags is a
u32, matching x86 prior to the introduction of THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK.

However, common helpers like test_ti_thread_flag() implicitly assume
that thread_info::flags has at least the size and alignment of unsigned
long, and relying on padding and alignment provided by other elements of
task_struct is somewhat fragile. Additionally, some architectures use
more that 32 bits for thread_info::flags, and others may need to in
future.

With THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, task struct follows thread_info with a long
field, and thus we no longer save any space as we did back in commit:

  affa219b60a11b32 ("x86: change thread_info's flag field back to 32 bits")

Given all this, it makes more sense for the generic thread_info::flags
to be an unsigned long.

In fact given <linux/thread_info.h> contains/uses the helpers mentioned
above, BE arches *must* use unsigned long (or something of the same size)
today, or they wouldn't work.

Make it so.
