ceph: fix error handling in ceph_read_iter

In case __ceph_do_getattr returns an error and the retry_op in
ceph_read_iter is not READ_INLINE, then it's possible to invoke
__free_page on a page which is NULL, this naturally leads to a crash.
This can happen when, for example, a process waiting on a MDS reply
receives sigterm.

Fix this by explicitly checking whether the page is set or not.
