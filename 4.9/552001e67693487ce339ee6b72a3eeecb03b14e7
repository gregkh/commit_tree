[media] Partly revert "[media] rc-core: allow calling rc_open with device not initialized"

This partly reverts commit 078600f514a12fd763ac84c86af68ef5b5267563.

Due to the relocation of input_register_device() call, holding down a
button on an IR remote no longer resulted in repeated key down events.
