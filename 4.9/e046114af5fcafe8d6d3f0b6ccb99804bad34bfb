libnvdimm: clear the internal poison_list when clearing badblocks

nvdimm_clear_poison cleared the user-visible badblocks, and sent
commands to the NVDIMM to clear the areas marked as 'poison', but it
neglected to clear the same areas from the internal poison_list which is
used to marshal ARS results before sorting them by namespace. As a
result, once on-demand ARS functionality was added:

37b137f nfit, libnvdimm: allow an ARS scrub to be triggered on demand

A scrub triggered from either sysfs or an MCE was found to be adding
stale entries that had been cleared from gendisk->badblocks, but were
still present in nvdimm_bus->poison_list. Additionally, the stale entries
could be triggered into producing stale disk->badblocks by simply disabling
and re-enabling the namespace or region.

This adds the missing step of clearing poison_list entries when clearing
poison, so that it is always in sync with badblocks.
