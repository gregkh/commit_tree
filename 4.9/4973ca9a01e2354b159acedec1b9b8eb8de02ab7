HID: add quirk for Akai MIDImix.

The Akai MIDImix (09e8:0031) is a MIDI fader controller that speaks
regular MIDI and works well with Linux. However, initialization gets
delayed due to reports timeout:

  [3643645.631124] hid-generic 0003:09E8:0031.0020: timeout initializing reports
  [3643645.632416] hid-generic 0003:09E8:0031.0020: hiddev0: USB HID v1.11 Device [AKAI MIDI Mix] on usb-0000:00:14.0-2/input0

Adding "usbhid.quirks=0x09e8:0x0031:0x20000000" on the kernel
command line makes the issues go away.
