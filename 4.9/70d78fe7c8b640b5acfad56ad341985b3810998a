coredump: fix unfreezable coredumping task

It could be not possible to freeze coredumping task when it waits for
'core_state->startup' completion, because threads are frozen in
get_signal() before they got a chance to complete 'core_state->startup'.

Inability to freeze a task during suspend will cause suspend to fail.
Also CRIU uses cgroup freezer during dump operation.  So with an
unfreezable task the CRIU dump will fail because it waits for a
transition from 'FREEZING' to 'FROZEN' state which will never happen.

Use freezer_do_not_count() to tell freezer to ignore coredumping task
while it waits for core_state->startup completion.
