xfs: optimize writes to reflink files

Instead of reserving space as the first thing in write_begin move it past
reading the extent in the data fork.  That way we only have to read from
the data fork once and can reuse that information for trimming the extent
to the shared/unshared boundary.  Additionally this allows to easily
limit the actual write size to said boundary, and avoid a roundtrip on the
ilock.
