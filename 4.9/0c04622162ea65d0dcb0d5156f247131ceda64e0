[media] extended-controls.rst: avoid going past page with LaTeX

It is painful to put code/verbatim code in bold. It seems that
the only way is to arrange it like:
	``foo``
	    bar

At least on LaTeX output, when this happens, the "foo" string
is not hidentable/breakable. The entire string should fit into
a single line.

Add a workaround for this ReST limitation by splitting the
foo string into two strings, on separate lines. The output
is not the best, but it works.
