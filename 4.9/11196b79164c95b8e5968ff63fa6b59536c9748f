perf tools: Skip running the feature tests for 'make install-doc'

It is a requirement from the perf TODO list[1]:

''The feature tests should be performed only when a file that needs those
  tests, or at least only when some .c or .h file will be rebuilt. An
  initial step would be for 'make install-doc' not to run the feature
  tests, there it is not needed at all.''

By adding 'install-doc' to the NON_CONFIG_TARGETS, it will skip running
the feature tests for such target. The Auto-detecting system features
list will not be displayed:

  $ make install-doc
    BUILD:   Doing 'make -j2' parallel build
    SUBDIR   Documentation
  make[2]: Nothing to be done for 'install'.
