x86/apic, ACPI: Remove the repeated lapic address override entry parsing

The ACPI MADT has a 32-bit field providing lapic address at which
each processor can access its lapic information. MADT also contains
an optional entry to provide a 64-bit address to override the 32-bit
one. However the current code does the lapic address override entry
parsing twice. One is in early_acpi_boot_init() because AMD NUMA need
get boot_cpu_id earlier. The other is in acpi_boot_init() which parses
all MADT entries.

So in this patch we remove the repeated code in the 2nd part.

Meanwhile print lapic override entry information like other MADT entry,
this will be added to boot log.

This patch is not supposed to change any runtime behavior, other than
improving kernel messages.
