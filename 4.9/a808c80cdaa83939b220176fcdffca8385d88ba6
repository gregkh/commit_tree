mei: add read callback on demand for fixed_address clients

The Fixed address clients do not work with the flow control, and the
packet RX callback was allocated upon TX with anticipation of a
following RX. This won't work if the clients with unsolicited Rx. Rather
than preparing read callback upon a write we allocate one directly on
the reciev path if one doesn't exists.
