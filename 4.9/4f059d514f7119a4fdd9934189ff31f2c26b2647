x86/platform/uv/BAU: Add UV4-specific functions

Add the UV4-specific function definitions and define an operations struct
to implement them in the BAU driver.

Many BAU MMRs, although functionally the same, have new addresses on UV4
due to hardware changes. Each MMR requires new read/write functions, but
their implementation in the driver does not change. Thus, it is enough to
enumerate them in the operations struct for the changes to take effect.
