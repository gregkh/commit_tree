oom, oom_reaper: allow to reap mm shared by the kthreads

oom reaper was skipped for an mm which is shared with the kernel thread
(aka use_mm()).  The primary concern was that such a kthread might want
to read from the userspace memory and see zero page as a result of the
oom reaper action.  This is no longer a problem after "mm: make sure
that kthreads will not refault oom reaped memory" because any attempt to
fault in when the MMF_UNSTABLE is set will result in SIGBUS and so the
target user should see an error.  This means that we can finally allow
oom reaper also to tasks which share their mm with kthreads.
