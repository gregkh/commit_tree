libata: SCT Write Same / DSM Trim

Correct handling of devices with sector_size other that 512 bytes.

In the case of a 4Kn device sector_size it is possible to describe a much
larger DSM Trim than the current fixed default of 512 bytes.

This patch assumes the minimum descriptor is sector_size and fills out
the descriptor accordingly.

The ACS-2 specification is quite clear that the DSM command payload is
sized as number of 512 byte transfers so a 4Kn device will operate
correctly without this patch.
