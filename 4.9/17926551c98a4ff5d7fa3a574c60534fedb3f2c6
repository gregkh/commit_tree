PM / Domains: Add support for removing nested PM domains by provider

If a device supports PM domains that are subdomains of another PM
domain, then the PM domains should be removed in reverse order to
ensure that the subdomains are removed first. Furthermore, if there is
more than one provider, then there needs to be a way to remove the
domains in reverse order for a specific provider.

Add the function of_genpd_remove_last() to remove the last PM domain
added by a given PM domain provider and return the generic_pm_domain
structure for the PM domain that was removed.
