[media] subdev-formats.rst: adjust most of the tables to fill in page

Fix mosto fo the tables there in order to make them fit at the
page size.

There are, however, two exceptions: RGB and YUV big tables,
where adding the raw latex adjustbox caused the tables to not
be properly formatted. I suspect that the problem is because
those are long tables, but not really sure.

The thing is that Sphinx lacks an "adjustbox" tag that would
avoid the raw latex hacks.
