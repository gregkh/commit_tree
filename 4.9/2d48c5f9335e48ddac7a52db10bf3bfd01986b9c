bpf: use skb_to_full_sk helper in bpf_skb_under_cgroup

We need to use skb_to_full_sk() helper introduced in commit bd5eb35f16a9
("xfrm: take care of request sockets") as otherwise we miss tcp synack
messages, since ownership is on request socket and therefore it would
miss the sk_fullsock() check. Use skb_to_full_sk() as also done similarly
in the bpf_get_cgroup_classid() helper via 2309236c13fe ("cls_cgroup:
get sk_classid only from full sockets") fix to not let this fall through.
