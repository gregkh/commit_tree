powerpc/64s: Add new exception vector macros

Create arch/powerpc/include/asm/head-64.h with macros that specify
an exception vector (name, type, location), which will be used to
label and lay out exceptions into the object file.

Naming is moved out of exception-64s.h, which is used to specify the
implementation of exception handlers.

objdump of generated code in exception vectors is unchanged except for
names. Alignment directives scattered around are annoying, but done
this way so that disassembly can verify identical instruction
generation before and after patch. These get cleaned up in future
patch.

We change the way KVMTEST works, explicitly passing EXC_HV or EXC_STD
rather than overloading the trap number. This removes the need to have
SOFTEN values for the overloaded trap numbers, eg. 0x502.
