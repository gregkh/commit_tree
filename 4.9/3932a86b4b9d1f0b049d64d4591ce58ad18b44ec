cfq: fix starvation of asynchronous writes

While debugging timeouts happening in my application workload (ScyllaDB), I have
observed calls to open() taking a long time, ranging everywhere from 2 seconds -
the first ones that are enough to time out my application - to more than 30
seconds.

The problem seems to happen because XFS may block on pending metadata updates
under certain circumnstances, and that's confirmed with the following backtrace
taken by the offcputime tool (iovisor/bcc):

    ffffffffb90c57b1 finish_task_switch

Inspecting my run with blktrace, I can see that the xfsaild kthread exhibit very
high "Dispatch wait" times, on the dozens of seconds range and consistent with
the open() times I have saw in that run.

Still from the blktrace output, we can after searching a bit, identify the
request that wasn't dispatched:

  8,0   11      152    81.092472813   804  A  WM 141698288 + 8 <- (8,1) 141696240
  8,0   11      153    81.092472889   804  Q  WM 141698288 + 8 [xfsaild/sda1]
  8,0   11      154    81.092473207   804  G  WM 141698288 + 8 [xfsaild/sda1]
  8,0   11      206    81.092496118   804  I  WM 141698288 + 8 (   22911) [xfsaild/sda1]
  <==== 'I' means Inserted (into the IO scheduler) ===================================>
  8,0    0   289372    96.718761435     0  D  WM 141698288 + 8 (15626265317) [swapper/0]
  <==== Only 15s later the CFQ scheduler dispatches the request ======================>

As we can see above, in this particular example CFQ took 15 seconds to dispatch
this request. Going back to the full trace, we can see that the xfsaild queue
had plenty of opportunity to run, and it was selected as the active queue many
times. It would just always be preempted by something else (example):

  8,0    1        0    81.117912979     0  m   N cfq1618SN / insert_request
  8,0    1        0    81.117913419     0  m   N cfq1618SN / add_to_rr
  8,0    1        0    81.117914044     0  m   N cfq1618SN / preempt
  8,0    1        0    81.117914398     0  m   N cfq767A  / slice expired t=1
  8,0    1        0    81.117914755     0  m   N cfq767A  / resid=40
  8,0    1        0    81.117915340     0  m   N / served: vt=1948520448 min_vt=1948520448
  8,0    1        0    81.117915858     0  m   N cfq767A  / sl_used=1 disp=0 charge=0 iops=1 sect=0

where cfq767 is the xfsaild queue and cfq1618 corresponds to one of the ScyllaDB
IO dispatchers.

The requests preempting the xfsaild queue are synchronous requests. That's a
characteristic of ScyllaDB workloads, as we only ever issue O_DIRECT requests.
While it can be argued that preempting ASYNC requests in favor of SYNC is part
of the CFQ logic, I don't believe that doing so for 15+ seconds is anyone's
goal.

Moreover, unless I am misunderstanding something, that breaks the expectation
set by the "fifo_expire_async" tunable, which in my system is set to the
default.

Looking at the code, it seems to me that the issue is that after we make
an async queue active, there is no guarantee that it will execute any request.

When the queue itself tests if it cfq_may_dispatch() it can bail if it sees SYNC
requests in flight. An incoming request from another queue can also preempt it
in such situation before we have the chance to execute anything (as seen in the
trace above).

This patch sets the must_dispatch flag if we notice that we have requests
that are already fifo_expired. This flag is always cleared after
cfq_dispatch_request() returns from cfq_dispatch_requests(), so it won't pin
the queue for subsequent requests (unless they are themselves expired)

Care is taken during preempt to still allow rt requests to preempt us
regardless.

Testing my workload with this patch applied produces much better results.
From the application side I see no timeouts, and the open() latency histogram
generated by systemtap looks much better, with the worst outlier at 131ms:
