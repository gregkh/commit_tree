IB/srp: Fix infinite loop when FMR sg[0].offset != 0

Avoid that mapping an sg-list in which the first element has a
non-zero offset triggers an infinite loop when using FMR. This
patch makes the FMR mapping code similar to that of ib_sg_to_pages().

Note: older Mellanox HCAs do not support non-zero offsets for FMR.

into an FMR").
