IB/mlx5: Add port counter support for raw packet QP

Counters weren't updated due to raw packet QPs' traffic since the
counter-id was not associated with the QP. Added support for
associating the q-counter-id with the raw packet QP. The attachment
is done only when changing RQ raw packet QP state from RST to INIT
in modify-RQ command. FW support is required for the above, without
this support raw packet QP counters will not count.
