extcon: Use the extcon_set_state_sync() instead of deprecated functions

This patch alters the renamed extcon API to set the state of the external
connectors instead of deprecated extcon_set_cable_state_().

Because the patch[1] modifies the function name to maintain the function
naming pattern.
- extcon_set_cable_state_() -> extcon_set_state_sync()
- extcon_get_cable_state_() -> extcon_get_state()
