greybus: interface: clean up ES3-bootroom-quirk handling

Clean up handling of the ES3-bootrom quirks by adding an interface
quirk-flags field that is set appropriately when we detect that the ES3
bootrom is running.

Note that we need to reserve the DME_DIS_UNIPRO_BOOT_STARTED and
DME_DIS_FALLBACK_UNIPRO_BOOT_STARTED status values for the ES3 bootrom,
which does not support any CPort features (unlike later boot stages).
Add a BOOTROM infix to the defines to make this more clear.
