MIPS: SEAD3: Probe UARTs using DT

Probe the UARTs on SEAD3 boards using device tree rather than platform
code, in order to reduce the amount of the latter. This requires that
CONFIG_SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM be enabled, so enable it in sead3_defconfig.
The SEAD3 DT shim code is extended to read bootloader environment
variables to determine the appropriate UART & mode for kernel console
output & set the stdout-path property of the chosen node accordingly.

In contrast to the old platform code, which appears to have only ever
set "console=ttyS0,38400n8r" with the code in console_config never
having an effect, this will honor the "yamontty" environment variable to
select between the 2 UARTs on the board and then check the "modetty0" or
"modetty1" variable as appropriate to determine the UART configuration.
