staging: iio: ad5933: avoid uninitialized variable in error case

The ad5933_i2c_read function returns an error code to indicate
whether it could read data or not. However ad5933_work() ignores
this return code and just accesses the data unconditionally,
which gets detected by gcc as a possible bug:

drivers/staging/iio/impedance-analyzer/ad5933.c: In function 'ad5933_work':
drivers/staging/iio/impedance-analyzer/ad5933.c:649:16: warning: 'status' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

This adds minimal error handling so we only evaluate the
data if it was correctly read.
