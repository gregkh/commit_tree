mm: fix set pageblock migratetype in deferred struct page init

On x86_64 MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES is usually 4M, and a pageblock is usually
2M, so we only set one pageblock's migratetype in deferred_free_range()
if pfn is aligned to MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES.  That means it causes
uninitialized migratetype blocks, you can see from "cat
/proc/pagetypeinfo", almost half blocks are Unmovable.

Also we missed freeing the last block in deferred_init_memmap(), it
causes memory leak.

Fixes: ac5d2539b238 ("mm: meminit: reduce number of times pageblocks are set during struct page init")
