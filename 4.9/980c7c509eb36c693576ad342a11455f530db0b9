greybus: uart-gb: handle throttle/unthrottle properly

This hooks up throttle/unthrottle to properly toggle the RTS line or do
XON/XOFF if that is how the port is set up.

Note, if the UART itself can handle XON/XOFF, we would need to send the
correct character down to it, to have the firmware in the device set up
the chip to use it automatically when needed.  The odds of someone
wanting to use this type of flow control is slim, so this isn't
implemented at this point in time.

Also fill in a few more fields in the get_serial_info ioctl, to make
tools like stty(1) happier.
