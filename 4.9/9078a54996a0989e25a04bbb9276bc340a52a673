s390: claim efficient unaligned access

most unaligned accesses are reasonable efficient (no kernel emulation)
on s390, let's announce it

This also
- removes the ubsan false positives for unaligned accesses on s390 with
  default config
- uses simpler arithmetic in several functions in several other areas
  of the kernel like ethernet frame classification
