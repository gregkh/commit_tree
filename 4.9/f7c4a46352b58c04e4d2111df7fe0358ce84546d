phy: twl4030-usb: Fix for musb session bit based PM

Now with musb driver implementing generic session bit based
PM, we need to have the USB PHYs behaving in a sane way for
platforms implementing PM.

Currently twl4030-usb enables PM in twl4030_phy_power_on()
and then disables it in twl4030_phy_power_off(). This will
block PM runtime for the SoC when no cable is connected.

Fix the issue by moving PM runtime autosuspend call to
happen where it gets called in twl4030_phy_power_on().

Note that this patch should not be backported to anything
before commit 467d5c980709 ("usb: musb: Implement session bit
based runtime PM for musb-core") as before that all the
glue layers implemented their own PM.

runtime PM for musb-core")
