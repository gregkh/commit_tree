ARM: dts: am335x-evm: Add blue-and-red-wiring -property to lcdc node

Add blue-and-red-wiring -property to lcdc node. The am335x-evm has
blue and red wires crossed to get 24-bit RGB (and 16-bit BGR)
support. After this patch am335x-evm supports BGR565, RGB888, and
XRGB8888 color formats. See details in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/tilcdc/tilcdc.txt.
