watchdog: add watchdog pretimeout governor framework

The change adds a simple watchdog pretimeout framework infrastructure,
its purpose is to allow users to select a desired handling of watchdog
pretimeout events, which may be generated by some watchdog devices.

A user selects a default watchdog pretimeout governor during
compilation stage.

Watchdogs with WDIOF_PRETIMEOUT capability now have one more device
attribute in sysfs, pretimeout_governor attribute is intended to display
the selected watchdog pretimeout governor.

The framework has no impact at runtime on watchdog devices with no
WDIOF_PRETIMEOUT capability set.
