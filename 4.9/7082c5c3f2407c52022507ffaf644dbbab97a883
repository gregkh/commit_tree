tcp: zero ca_priv area when switching cc algorithms

We need to zero out the private data area when application switches
connection to different algorithm (TCP_CONGESTION setsockopt).

When congestion ops get assigned at connect time everything is already
zeroed because sk_alloc uses GFP_ZERO flag.  But in the setsockopt case
this contains whatever previous cc placed there.
