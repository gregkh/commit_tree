Fix USB CB/CBI storage devices with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y

Some code (all error handling) submits CDBs that are allocated
on the stack.  This breaks with CB/CBI code that tries to create
URB directly from SCSI command buffer - which happens to be in
vmalloced memory with vmalloced kernel stacks.

Let's make copy of the command in usb_stor_CB_transport.
