powerpc/powernv: Call opal_pci_poll() if needed

When issuing PHB reset, OPAL API opal_pci_poll() is called to drive
the state machine in OPAL forward. However, we needn't always call
the function under some circumstances like reset deassert.

This avoids calling opal_pci_poll() when OPAL_SUCCESS is returned
from opal_pci_reset(). Except the overhead introduced by additional
one unnecessary OPAL call, I didn't run into real issue because of
this.
