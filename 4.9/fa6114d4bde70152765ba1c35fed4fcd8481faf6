net: macb: NULL out phydev after removing mdio bus

To ensure the dev->phydev pointer is not used after becoming invalid in
mdiobus_unregister, set it to NULL. This happens when removing the macb
driver without first taking its interface down, since unregister_netdev
will end up calling macb_close.
