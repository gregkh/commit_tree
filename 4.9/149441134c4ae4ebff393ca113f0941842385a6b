drm/tilcdc: Write to LCDC_END_OF_INT_IND_REG at the end of IRQ function

Reorder the IRQ function so that the write to LCDC_END_OF_INT_IND_REG
is done last. The write to LCDC_END_OF_INT_IND_REG indicates to LCDC
that the interrupt service routine has completed (see section
13.3.6.1.6 in AM335x TRM). This is needed if LCDC's ipgvmodirq module
is configured for pulse interrupts.
