i40e: Don't notify client of VF reset during VF creation

VF goes through reset path during VF creation which happens to also
have notification of VF reset to client. Adding conditional check to
avoid wrongly notifying VF reset during VF creation.

Also changing the call order of VF enable, calling it after VF creation
rather than before.
