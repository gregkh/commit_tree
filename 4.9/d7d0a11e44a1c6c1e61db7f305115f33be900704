KVM: arm: vgic: Support 64-bit data manipulation on 32-bit host systems

We have couple of 64-bit registers defined in GICv3 architecture, so
unsigned long accesses to these registers will only access a single
32-bit part of that regitser. On the other hand these registers can't
be accessed as 64-bit with a single instruction like ldrd/strd or
ldmia/stmia if we run a 32-bit host because KVM does not support
access to MMIO space done by these instructions.

It means that a 32-bit guest accesses these registers in 32-bit
chunks, so the only thing we need to do is to ensure that
extract_bytes() always takes 64-bit data.
