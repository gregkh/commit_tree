lightnvm: expose device geometry through sysfs

For a host to access an Open-Channel SSD, it has to know its geometry,
so that it writes and reads at the appropriate device bounds.

Currently, the geometry information is kept within the kernel, and not
exported to user-space for consumption. This patch exposes the
configuration through sysfs and enables user-space libraries, such as
liblightnvm, to use the sysfs implementation to get the geometry of an
Open-Channel SSD.

The sysfs entries are stored within the device hierarchy, and can be
found using the "lightnvm" device type.

An example configuration looks like this:
