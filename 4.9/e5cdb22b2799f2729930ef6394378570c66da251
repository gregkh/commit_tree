drm/i915: Move assertion for iomap access to i915_vma_pin_iomap

Access through the GTT requires the device to be awake. Ideally
i915_vma_pin_iomap() is short-lived and the pinning demarcates the
access through the iomap. This is not entirely true, we have a mixture
of long lived pins that exceed the wakelock (such as legacy ringbuffers)
and short lived pin that do live within the wakelock (such as execlist
ringbuffers).
