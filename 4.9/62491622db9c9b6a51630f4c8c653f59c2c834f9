greybus: interface: make sure type is invariant during reactivation

An interface is not expected to change its type after a power down and
reactivation so make sure to treat that as a fatal error.

This is complicated by the current Toshiba ES3 hack which requires us
to retry activation as Greybus interfaces are sometimes misdetected as
UniPro interfaces. Handle that by only retrying activation the first
time an interface is activated, and for interfaces already detected as
having Greybus type.
