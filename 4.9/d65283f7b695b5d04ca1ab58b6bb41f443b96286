ARC: module: elide loop to save reference to .eh_frame

The loop was really needed in .debug_frame regime where wanted make it
as SH_ALLOC so that apply_relocate_add() would process it. That's not
needed for .eh_frame, so we check this in apply_relocate_add() which
gets called for each section.

Note that we need to save reference to "section name strings" section in
module_frob_arch_sections() since apply_relocate_add() doesn't get that
