powerpc: implement arch_reserved_kernel_pages

Currently significant amount of memory is reserved only in kernel booted
to capture kernel dump using the fa_dump method.

Kernels compiled with CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT will initialize
only certain size memory per node.  The certain size takes into account
the dentry and inode cache sizes.  Currently the cache sizes are
calculated based on the total system memory including the reserved
memory.  However such a kernel when booting the same kernel as fadump
kernel will not be able to allocate the required amount of memory to
suffice for the dentry and inode caches.  This results in crashes like

Hence only implement arch_reserved_kernel_pages() for CONFIG_FA_DUMP
configurations.  The amount reserved will be reduced while calculating
the large caches and will avoid crashes like the below on large systems
such as 32 TB systems.
