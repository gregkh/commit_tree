base: soc: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/base/Kconfig:config SOC_BUS
drivers/base/Kconfig:   bool

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init was not in use by this code, the init ordering
remains unchanged with this commit.
