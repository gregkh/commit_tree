bonding: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

alloc_ordered_workqueue() with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set, replaces
deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue(). This is the identity
conversion.

The workqueue "wq" queues multiple work items viz
&bond->mcast_work, &nnw->work, &bond->mii_work, &bond->arp_work,
&bond->alb_work, &bond->mii_work, &bond->ad_work, &bond->slave_arr_work
which require strict execution ordering. Hence, an ordered dedicated
workqueue has been used.

Since, it is a network driver, WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to
ensure forward progress under memory pressure.
