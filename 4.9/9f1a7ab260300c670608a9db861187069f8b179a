drm/i915: Grab the rotation from the passed plane state for VLV sprites

Use the passed in plane_state instead of plane->state in
vlv_update_plane(). Currently the two are one and the same, but if we
start queuing up multiple plane updates they might not be.

Looks like this was rebase fail on my part.
