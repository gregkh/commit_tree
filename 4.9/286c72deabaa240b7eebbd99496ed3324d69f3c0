udp: must lock the socket in udp_disconnect()

Baozeng Ding reported KASAN traces showing uses after free in
udp_lib_get_port() and other related UDP functions.

A CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y kernel would eventually crash.

I could write a reproducer with two threads doing :

static int sock_fd;
static void *thr1(void *arg)
{
	for (;;) {
		connect(sock_fd, (const struct sockaddr *)arg,
			sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
	}
}

static void *thr2(void *arg)
{
	struct sockaddr_in unspec;

	for (;;) {
		memset(&unspec, 0, sizeof(unspec));
	        connect(sock_fd, (const struct sockaddr *)&unspec,
			sizeof(unspec));
        }
}

Problem is that udp_disconnect() could run without holding socket lock,
and this was causing list corruptions.
