fscrypto: don't use on-stack buffer for key derivation

With the new (in 4.9) option to use a virtually-mapped stack
(CONFIG_VMAP_STACK), stack buffers cannot be used as input/output for
the scatterlist crypto API because they may not be directly mappable to
struct page.  get_crypt_info() was using a stack buffer to hold the
output from the encryption operation used to derive the per-file key.
Fix it by using a heap buffer.

This bug could most easily be observed in a CONFIG_DEBUG_SG kernel
because this allowed the BUG in sg_set_buf() to be triggered.
