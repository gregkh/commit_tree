ARM64: zynqmp: Align gic ranges for 64k in device tree

The GIC ranges in the zynqmp device tree are only 4kb aligned. Since
commit 12e14066f we automatically deal with aliases GIC regions though,
so we can map them transparently into guests even on 64kb page size
systems.

This patch makes use of that features and sets GICC and GICV to 64kb
aligned and sized regions.
