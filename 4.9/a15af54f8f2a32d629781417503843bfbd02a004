net/ncsi: Rework request index allocation

The NCSI request index (struct ncsi_request::id) is put into instance
ID (IID) field while sending NCSI command packet. It was designed the
available IDs are given in round-robin fashion. @ndp->request_id was
introduced to represent the next available ID, but it has been used
as number of successively allocated IDs. It breaks the round-robin
design. Besides, we shouldn't put 0 to NCSI command packet's IID
field, meaning ID#0 should be reserved according section 6.3.1.1
in NCSI spec (v1.1.0).

This fixes above two issues. With it applied, the available IDs will
be assigned in round-robin fashion and ID#0 won't be assigned.
