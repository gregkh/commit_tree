be2net: mark symbols static where possible

We get 4 warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/net/ethernet/emulex/benet/be_main.c:4368:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'be_calculate_pf_pool_rss_tables' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/net/ethernet/emulex/benet/be_cmds.c:4385:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'be_get_nic_pf_num_list' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/net/ethernet/emulex/benet/be_cmds.c:4537:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'be_reset_nic_desc' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/net/ethernet/emulex/benet/be_cmds.c:4910:5: warning: no previous prototype for '__be_cmd_set_logical_link_config' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
