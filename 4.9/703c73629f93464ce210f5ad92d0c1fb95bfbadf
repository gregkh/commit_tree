fuse: Use generic xattr ops

In preparation for posix acl support, rework fuse to use xattr handlers and
the generic setxattr/getxattr/listxattr callbacks.  Split the xattr code
out into it's own file, and promote symbols to module-global scope as
needed.

Functionally these changes have no impact, as fuse still uses a single
handler for all xattrs which uses the old callbacks.
