drm/i915: Mark up i915_gem_active for locking annotation

The future annotations will track the locking used for access to ensure
that it is always sufficient. We make the preparations now to present
the API ahead and to make sure that GCC can eliminate the unused
parameter.

Before:	6298417 3619610  696320 10614347         a1f64b vmlinux
After:	6298417 3619610  696320 10614347         a1f64b vmlinux
(with i915 builtin)
