scsi: libfc: Issue PRLI after a PRLO has been received

When receiving a PRLO it just means that the operating parameters have
changed, it does _not_ mean that the port doesn't want to communicate
with us.  So instead of implicitly logging out we should be issueing a
PRLI to figure out the new operating parameters.  We can always recover
once PRLI fails.
