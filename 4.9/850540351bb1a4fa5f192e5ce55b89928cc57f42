arm64: kernel: Init MDCR_EL2 even in the absence of a PMU

Commit f436b2ac90a0 ("arm64: kernel: fix architected PMU registers
unconditional access") made sure we wouldn't access unimplemented
PMU registers, but also left MDCR_EL2 uninitialized in that case,
leading to trap bits being potentially left set.

Make sure we always write something in that register.
