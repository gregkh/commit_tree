svm: Implements update_pi_irte hook to setup posted interrupt

This patch implements update_pi_irte function hook to allow SVM
communicate to IOMMU driver regarding how to set up IRTE for handling
posted interrupt.

In case AVIC is enabled, during vcpu_load/unload, SVM needs to update
IOMMU IRTE with appropriate host physical APIC ID. Also, when
vcpu_blocking/unblocking, SVM needs to update the is-running bit in
the IOMMU IRTE. Both are achieved via calling amd_iommu_update_ga().

However, if GA mode is not enabled for the pass-through device,
IOMMU driver will simply just return when calling amd_iommu_update_ga.
