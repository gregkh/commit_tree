net/ncsi: Introduce ncsi_stop_dev()

This introduces ncsi_stop_dev(), as counterpart to ncsi_start_dev(),
to stop the NCSI device so that it can be reenabled in future. This
API should be called when the network device driver is going to
shutdown the device. There are 3 things done in the function: Stop
the channel monitoring; Reset channels to inactive state; Report
NCSI link down.
