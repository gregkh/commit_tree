qed*: Fix Kconfig dependencies with INFINIBAND_QEDR

The qedr driver would require a tristate Kconfig option [to allow
it to compile as a module], and toward that end we've added the
INFINIBAND_QEDR option. But as we've made the compilation of the
qed/qede infrastructure required for RoCE dependent on the option
we'd be facing linking difficulties in case that QED=y or QEDE=y,
and INFINIBAND_QEDR=m.

To resolve this, we seperate between the INFINIBAND_QEDR option
and the infrastructure support in qed/qede by introducing a new
QED_RDMA option which would be selected by INFINIBAND_QEDR but would
be a boolean instead of a tristate; Following that, the qed/qede is
fixed based on this new option so that all config combinations would
be supported.
