drm/i915: Drive request submission through fence callbacks

Drive final request submission from a callback from the fence. This way
the request is queued until all dependencies are resolved, at which
point it is handed to the backend for queueing to hardware. At this
point, no dependencies are set on the request, so the callback is
immediate.

A side-effect of imposing a heavier-irqsafe spinlock for execlist
submission is that we lose the softirq enabling after scheduling the
execlists tasklet. To compensate, we manually kickstart the softirq by
disabling and enabling the bh around the fence signaling.
