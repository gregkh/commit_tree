Input: psmouse - remove deprecated create_singletheread_workqueue

alloc_ordered_workqueue() replaces the deprecated
create_singlethread_workqueue().

There are multiple work items on the work queue viz
&priv->dev3_register_work, &priv->recalib_wq, &psmouse->resync_work,
which require execution ordering. Hence, an ordered workqueue has been
used.

The workqueue is not being used on a memory reclaim path.  Hence,
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has not been set.
