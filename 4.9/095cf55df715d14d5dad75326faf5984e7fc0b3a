KVM: x86: Hyper-V tsc page setup

Lately tsc page was implemented but filled with empty
values. This patch setup tsc page scale and offset based
on vcpu tsc, tsc_khz and  HV_X64_MSR_TIME_REF_COUNT value.

The valid tsc page drops HV_X64_MSR_TIME_REF_COUNT msr
reads count to zero which potentially improves performance.
