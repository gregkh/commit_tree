parisc: Also flush data TLB in flush_icache_page_asm

This is the second issue I noticed in reviewing the parisc TLB code.

The fic instruction may use either the instruction or data TLB in
flushing the instruction cache.  Thus, on machines with a split TLB, we
should also flush the data TLB after setting up the temporary alias
registers.

Although this has no functional impact, I changed the pdtlb and pitlb
instructions to consistently use the index register %r0.  These
instructions do not support integer displacements.

Tested on rp3440 and c8000.
