drm/i915: consistent struct device naming

We currently have a mix of struct device *device, struct device *kdev,
and struct device *dev (the latter forcing us to refer to
struct drm_device as something else than the normal dev).

To simplify things, always use kdev when referring to struct device.

v2: Replace the dev_to_drm_minor() macro with the inline function
    kdev_to_drm_minor().
