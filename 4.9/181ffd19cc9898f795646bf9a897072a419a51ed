x86/PCI: VMD: Move VMD driver to drivers/pci/host

Move the driver source and Kconfig to the PCI host bridge drivers directory
and move the config option to a more appropriate sub-menu instead of
occupying the top-level location.

Update the Kconfig option with the X86_64 dependency that was implicitly
included from the previous location, and add information about the module
name when built as a loadable module.
