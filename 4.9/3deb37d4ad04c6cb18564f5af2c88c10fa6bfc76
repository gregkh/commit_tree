greybus: use special operation result valus

This is more or less re-implementing this commit:
    96f95d4 greybus: update gbuf status for completion handlers
But this time we're doing this for an operation, not the gbuf.

Define an initial operation result value (-EBADR) to signify that no
valid result has been set.  Nobody should ever set that value after
the operation is initially created.  Since only the operation core
code sets the result, an attempt to set -EBADR would be a bug.

Define another known operation result value (-EINPROGRESS) for an
outgoing operation whose request has been sent but whose response
has not yet been successfully received.  This should the first
(non-initial) result value set, and it should happen exactly once.
Any other attempt to set this value once set would be a bug.

Finally, once the request message is in flight, the result value
will be set exactly once more, to indicate the final result of
the operation.
