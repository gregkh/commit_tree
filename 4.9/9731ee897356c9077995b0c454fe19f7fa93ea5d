staging: rtl8723au: hal: check BT_Active and BT_State with correct bit pattern

BT_Active and BT_State are being masked with 0x00ffffff so it the subsequent
comparisons with 0xffffffff are therefore a buggy check.  Instead, check them
against 0x00ffffff.

Unfortunately I couldn't find a datasheet or hardware to see if 0xffffffff
is an expected invalid bit pattern that should be checked before BT_Active and
BT_State are masked with 0x00ffffff, so for now, this fix seems like the least
risky approach.
