net: make net namespace sysctls belong to container's owner

If net namespace is attached to a user namespace let's make container's
root owner of sysctls affecting said network namespace instead of global
root.

This also allows us to clean up net_ctl_permissions() because we do not
need to fudge permissions anymore for the container's owner since it now
owns the objects in question.
