net sched actions: fix GETing actions

With the batch changes that translated transient actions into
a temporary list lost in the translation was the fact that
tcf_action_destroy() will eventually delete the action from
the permanent location if the refcount is zero.

Example of what broke:
...add a gact action to drop
sudo $TC actions add action drop index 10
...now retrieve it, looks good
sudo $TC actions get action gact index 10
...retrieve it again and find it is gone!
sudo $TC actions get action gact index 10

Fixes: 22dc13c837c3 ("net_sched: convert tcf_exts from list to pointer array"),
Fixes: 824a7e8863b3 ("net_sched: remove an unnecessary list_del()")
Fixes: f07fed82ad79 ("net_sched: remove the leftover cleanup_a()")
