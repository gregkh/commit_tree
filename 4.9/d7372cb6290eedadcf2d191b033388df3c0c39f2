libata-scsi: use u8 array to store mode page copy

ata_mselect_*() would initialize a char array for storing a copy of
the current mode page. However, char could be signed char. In that
case, bytes larger than 127 would be converted to negative number.

For example, 0xff from def_control_mpage[] would become -1. This
prevented ata_mselect_control() from working at all, since when it
did the read-only bits check, there would always be a mismatch.
