scsi: cxlflash: Refactor WWPN setup

Commit 964497b3bf3f ("cxlflash: Remove dual port online dependency")
logically removed the ability for the WWPN setup routine afu_set_wwpn()
to return a non-success value. This routine can safely be made a void to
simplify the code as there is no longer a need to report a failure.
