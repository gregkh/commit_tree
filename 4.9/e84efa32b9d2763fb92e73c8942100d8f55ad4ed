NFSv4.1: work around -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

A bugfix introduced a harmless gcc warning in nfs4_slot_seqid_in_use if
we enable -Wmaybe-uninitialized again:

  fs/nfs/nfs4session.c:203:54: error: 'cur_seq' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

gcc is not smart enough to conclude that the IS_ERR/PTR_ERR pair results
in a nonzero return value here.  Using PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() instead makes
this clear to the compiler.
