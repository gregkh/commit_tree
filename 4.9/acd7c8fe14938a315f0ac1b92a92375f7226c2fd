IB/hfi1: Fix an Oops on pci device force remove

This patch fixes an Oops on device unbind, when the device is used
by a PSM user process. PSM processes access device resources which
are freed on device removal. Similar protection exists in uverbs
in ib_core for Verbs clients, but PSM doesn't use ib_uverbs hence
a separate protection is required for PSM clients.
