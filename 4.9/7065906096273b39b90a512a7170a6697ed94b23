nvme: Delete created IO queues on reset

The driver was decrementing the online_queues prior to attempting to
delete those IO queues, so the driver ended up not requesting the
controller delete any. This patch saves the online_queues prior to
suspending them, and adds that parameter for deleting io queues.
