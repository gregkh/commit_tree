netfilter: remove ip_conntrack* sysctl compat code

This backward compatibility has been around for more than ten years,
since Yasuyuki Kozakai introduced IPv6 in conntrack. These days, we have
alternate /proc/net/nf_conntrack* entries, the ctnetlink interface and
the conntrack utility got adopted by many people in the user community
according to what I observed on the netfilter user mailing list.

So let's get rid of this.

Note that nf_conntrack_htable_size and unsigned int nf_conntrack_max do
not need to be exported as symbol anymore.
