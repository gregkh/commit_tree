greybus: loopback: timestamp seeding should not drop metrics

In the current code if the ts variable is not initialized then any data
already gathered in a previous loopback command is dropped instead of
logged. Also the timestamping of ts is done after the greybus operation.

This delayed time-stamping means that the delta between the before and
after timestamps is incorrect and if a delay in-between loopback operations
has been specified by the user, the ts timestamp will be very skewed
indeed.

- Move the ts initialization directly before the greybus operation.
- Remove the continue statement on first initialization of the ts variable.
