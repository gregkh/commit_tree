arm64: dts: hi6220: add sd-uhs- properties into dwmmc_1

With these properties added, sd cards inserted into hikey can work at UHS
mode if they have such capability.

Note, this depends on HiKey UHS-SD support patch [1] to work properly.
If you didn't add this patch, but added sd-uhs- properties into dwmmc_1,
then sd cards cannot work. As of this post, patch [1] has been integrated
into maintainer's next branch [2].
