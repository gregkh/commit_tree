ARM: dts: sun8i: Rename reference-design-tablet touchscreen node

Rename the reference-design-tablet touchscreen node from gsl1680 to
touchscreen, all? tablets seem to use the same power and interrupt
gpio-s, but not all tablets use a gsl1680 controller making the
gsl1680 name somewhat misleading.

Also move the reg and compatible property to the actual tablet dts
as they may differ per tablet.
