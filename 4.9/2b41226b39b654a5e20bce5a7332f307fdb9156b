Revert "radix tree test suite: fix compilation"

This reverts commit 53855d10f4567a0577360b6448d52a863929775b.

It shouldn't have come in yet - it depends on the changes in linux-next
that will come in during the next merge window.  As Matthew Wilcox says,
the test suite is broken with the current state without the revert.
