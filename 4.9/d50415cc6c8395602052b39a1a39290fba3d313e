drm/i915: Refactor execbuffer relocation writing

With the introduction of the reloc page cache, we are just one step away
from refactoring the relocation write functions into one. Not only does
it tidy the code (slightly), but it greatly simplifies the control logic
much to gcc's satisfaction.

v2: Add selftests to document the relationship between the clflush
flags, the KMAP bit and packing into the page-aligned pointer.
