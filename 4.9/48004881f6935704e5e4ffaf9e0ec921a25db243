drm/i915: Mark CPU cache as dirty when used for rendering

On LLC, or even snooped, machines rendering via the GPU ends up in the CPU
cache. This cacheline dirt also needs to be flushed to main memory when
moving to an incoherent domain, such as the display's scanout engine.
Mostly, this happens because either the object is marked as dirty from
its first use or is avoided by setting the object into the display
domain from the start.

v2: Treat WT as not requiring a clflush prior to use on the display
engine as well.
