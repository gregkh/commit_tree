[media] mc-core.rst: fix a warning about an internal routine

Fix this warning:
	Documentation/media/kapi/mc-core.rst:97: WARNING: c:func reference target not found: media_devnode_release

The media_device_release() is a function internal to media-devnode.c,
and not exported elsewhere. So, we can't cross-reference it here.
Make it explicit at the documentation.
