ASoC: simple-scu-card: code sync: move asoc_simple_card_of_match

simple sound card family are using very similar style, but because of its
historical reason, there are small differences. For example pointer style,
function name, caller postion etc...
This patch synchronized simple card style to other simple card family

This patch moves asoc_simple_card_of_match to bottom side, and rename
it to asoc_simple_of_match same as other simple card family.
