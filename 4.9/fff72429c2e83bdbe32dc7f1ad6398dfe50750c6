rxrpc: Improve the call tracking tracepoint

Improve the call tracking tracepoint by showing more differentiation
between some of the put and get events, including:

  (1) Getting and putting refs for the socket call user ID tree.

  (2) Getting and putting refs for queueing and failing to queue the call
      processor work item.

Note that these aren't necessarily used in this patch, but will be taken
advantage of in future patches.

An enum is added for the event subtype numbers rather than coding them
directly as decimal numbers and a table of 3-letter strings is provided
rather than a sequence of ?: operators.
