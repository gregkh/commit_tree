doc: ioctl: Add some clarifications to botching-up-ioctls

- The guide currently says to pad the structure to a multiple of
  64-bits. This is not necessary in cases where the structure contains
  no 64-bit types. Clarify this concept to avoid unnecessary padding.
- When using __u64 to hold user pointers, blindly trying to do a cast to
  a void __user * may generate a warning on 32-bit systems about a cast
  from an integer to a pointer of different size. There is a macro to
  deal with this which hides an ugly double cast. Add a reference to
  this macro.
