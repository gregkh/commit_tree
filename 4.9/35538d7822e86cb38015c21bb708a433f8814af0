dma-buf/sw_sync: de-stage SW_SYNC

SW_SYNC allows to run tests on the sync_file framework via debugfs on

<debugfs>/sync/sw_sync

Opening and closing the file triggers creation and release of a sync
timeline. To create fences on this timeline the SW_SYNC_IOC_CREATE_FENCE
ioctl should be used. To increment the timeline value use SW_SYNC_IOC_INC.

Also it exports Sync information on

<debugfs>/sync/info
