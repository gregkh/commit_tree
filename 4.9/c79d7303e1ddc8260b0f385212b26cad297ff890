drm/i915/execlists: Reinitialise context image after GPU hang

On Braswell, at least, we observe that the context image is written in
multiple phases. The first phase is to clear the register state, and
subsequently rewrite it. A GPU reset at the right moment can interrupt
the context update leaving it corrupt, and our update of the RING_HEAD
is not sufficient to restart the engine afterwards. To recover, we need
to reset the registers back to their original values. The context state
is lost. What we need is a better mechanism to serialise the reset with
pending flushes from the GPU.
