scsi: bnx2fc: Mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/scsi/bnx2fc/bnx2fc_els.c:257:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'bnx2fc_srr_compl' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/bnx2fc/bnx2fc_els.c:367:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'bnx2fc_rec_compl' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/bnx2fc/bnx2fc_fcoe.c:628:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'bnx2fc_percpu_io_thread' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/bnx2fc/bnx2fc_fcoe.c:1413:26: warning: no previous prototype for 'bnx2fc_interface_create' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/bnx2fc/bnx2fc_hwi.c:997:21: warning: no previous prototype for 'bnx2fc_alloc_work' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/bnx2fc/bnx2fc_io.c:1082:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'bnx2fc_abts_cleanup' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
....

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.  so this
patch marks these functions with 'static'.
