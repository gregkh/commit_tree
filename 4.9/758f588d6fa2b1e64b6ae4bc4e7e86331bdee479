kvm/x86: Fix unused variable warning in kvm_timer_init()

When CONFIG_CPU_FREQ is not set, int cpu is unused and gcc rightfully
warns about it:

  arch/x86/kvm/x86.c: In function ‘kvm_timer_init’:
  arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:5697:6: warning: unused variable ‘cpu’ [-Wunused-variable]
    int cpu;
        ^~~

But since it is used only in the CONFIG_CPU_FREQ block, simply move it
there, thus squashing the warning too.
