qla2xxx: small cleanup in qla2x00_wait_for_hba_ready()

The "if (test_bit(UNLOADING..." line was indented one tab more than it
should have been.  There was an extra parenthesis around the
qla2x00_reset_active() function call.  I lined up the conditions a bit
so that it shows how they group together.
