torture: TOROUT_STRING(): Insert a space between flag and message

The TOROUT_STRING() macro does not insert a space between the flag and
the message.  In contrast, other similar torture-test dmesg messages
consistently supply a single space character.  This difference makes the
output hard to read and to mechanically parse.  This commit therefore
adds a space character between flag and message in TOROUT_STRING() output.
