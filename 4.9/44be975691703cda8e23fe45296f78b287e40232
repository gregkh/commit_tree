fs/ocfs2/super: remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue()

The workqueue "ocfs2_wq" queues multiple work items viz
&osb->la_enable_wq, &journal->j_recovery_work, &os->os_orphan_scan_work,
&osb->osb_truncate_log_wq which require strict execution ordering.  Hence,
an ordered dedicated workqueue has been used.

WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under memory
pressure because the workqueue is being used on a memory reclaim path.
