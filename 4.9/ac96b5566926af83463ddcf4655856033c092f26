io-mapping.h: s/PAGE_KERNEL_IO/PAGE_KERNEL/

PAGE_KERNEL_IO is an x86-ism. Though it is used to define the pgprot_t
used for the iomapped region, it itself is just PAGE_KERNEL. On all
other arches, PAGE_KERNEL_IO is undefined so in a general header we must
refrain from using it.

v2: include pgtable for pgprot_combine()
