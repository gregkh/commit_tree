net/ncsi: Avoid if statements in ncsi_suspend_channel()

There are several if/else statements in the state machine implemented
by switch/case in ncsi_suspend_channel() to avoid duplicated code. It
makes the code a bit hard to be understood.

This drops if/else statements in ncsi_suspend_channel() to improve the
code readability as Joel Stanley suggested. Also, it becomes easy to
add more states in the state machine without affecting current code.
No logical changes introduced by this.
