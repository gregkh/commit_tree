flowcache: Increase threshold for refusing new allocations

The threshold for OOM protection is too small for systems with large
number of CPUs. Applications report ENOBUFs on connect() every 10
minutes.

The problem is that the variable net->xfrm.flow_cache_gc_count is a
global counter while the variable fc->high_watermark is a per-CPU
constant. Take the number of CPUs into account as well.
