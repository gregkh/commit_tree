firewire: net: guard against rx buffer overflows

The IP-over-1394 driver firewire-net lacked input validation when
handling incoming fragmented datagrams.  A maliciously formed fragment
with a respectively large datagram_offset would cause a memcpy past the
datagram buffer.

So, drop any packets carrying a fragment with offset + length larger
than datagram_size.

In addition, ensure that
  - GASP header, unfragmented encapsulation header, or fragment
    encapsulation header actually exists before we access it,
  - the encapsulated datagram or fragment is of nonzero size.
