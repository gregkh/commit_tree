rxrpc: Fix exclusive client connections

Exclusive connections are currently reusable (which they shouldn't be)
because rxrpc_alloc_client_connection() checks the exclusive flag in the
rxrpc_connection struct before it's initialised from the function
parameters.  This means that the DONT_REUSE flag doesn't get set.

Fix this by checking the function parameters for the exclusive flag.
