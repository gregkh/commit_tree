drm/i915: Simplify calling engine->sync_to

Since requests can no longer be generated as a side-effect of
intel_ring_begin(), we know that the seqno will be unchanged during
ring-emission. This predicatablity then means we do not have to check
for the seqno wrapping around whilst emitting the semaphore for
engine->sync_to().
