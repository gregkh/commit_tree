gpio/mockup: add virtual gpio device

This patch add basic structure of a virtual gpio device(gpio-mockup)
for testing gpio subsystem. The tester could manipulate such device
through userspace(sysfs or char device) and check the result from
debugfs.

Currently, it support one or more gpiochip(determined by module
parameters with base,ngpio pair). One could test the overlap of
different gpiochip and test the direction and/or output values of
these chips.
