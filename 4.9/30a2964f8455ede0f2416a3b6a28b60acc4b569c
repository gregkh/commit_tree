greybus: distinguish incoming from outgoing requests

When we remove the mandatory status byte from response messages we
will no longer be able to use a zero-sized response to indicate
an operation is to be used for an incoming request.

Define a new function gb_operation_create_incoming() to be used
for incoming operations.  Change (and rename) gb_operation_create()
to be a helper that takes a Boolean to indicate which type is to be
created, and use a simple wrapper to expose the outgoing operation
creation routine.
