ext4: require encryption feature for EXT4_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY

...otherwise an user can enable encryption for certain files even
when the filesystem is unable to support it.
Such a case would be a filesystem created by mkfs.ext4's default
settings, 1KiB block size. Ext4 supports encyption only when block size
is equal to PAGE_SIZE.
But this constraint is only checked when the encryption feature flag
is set.
