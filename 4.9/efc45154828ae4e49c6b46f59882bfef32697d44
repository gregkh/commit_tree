uapi glibc compat: fix outer guard of net device flags enum

Fix a wrong condition preventing the higher net device flags
IFF_LOWER_UP etc to be defined if net/if.h is included before
linux/if.h.

The comment makes it clear the intention was to allow partial
definition with either parts.

This fixes compilation of userspace programs trying to use
IFF_LOWER_UP, IFF_DORMANT or IFF_ECHO.
