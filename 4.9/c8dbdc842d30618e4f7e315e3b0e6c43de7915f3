serial: xuartps: Rewrite the interrupt handling logic

The existing interrupt handling logic has following issues.
- Upon a parity error with default configuration, the control
  never comes out of the ISR thereby hanging Linux.
- The error handling logic around framing and parity error are buggy.
  There are chances that the errors will never be captured.
This patch ensures that the status registers are cleared on all cases so
that a hang situation never arises.
