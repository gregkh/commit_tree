MIPS: tracing: move insn_has_delay_slot to a shared header

Currently both kprobes and uprobes code have definitions of the
insn_has_delay_slot method. Move it to a separate header as an inline
method that each probe-specific method can later use.
No functional change intended, although the methods slightly varied in
the constraints they set for the methods - the uprobes one was chosen as
it is slightly more specific when filtering opcode fields.
