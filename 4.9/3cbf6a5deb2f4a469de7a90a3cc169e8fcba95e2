drm: Mark up legacy/dri1 drivers with DRM_LEGACY

It's super confusing that new drivers need to be marked with
DRIVER_MODESET when really it means DRIVER_MODERN. Much better to
invert the meaning and rename it to something that's suitably
off-putting.

Since there's over 100 places using DRIVER_MODESET we need to roll out
this change without a flag day.

v2: Update docs.
