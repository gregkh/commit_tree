perf hists browser: Fix event group display

Milian reported that the event group on TUI shows duplicated overhead.
This was due to a bug on calculating hpp->buf position.  The
hpp_advance() was called from __hpp__slsmg_color_printf() on TUI but
it's already called from the hpp__call_print_fn macro in __hpp__fmt().
The end result is that the print function returns number of bytes it
printed but the buffer advanced twice of the length.

This is generally not a problem since it doesn't need to access the
buffer again.  But with event group, overhead needs to be printed
multiple times and hist_entry__snprintf_alignment() tries to fill the
space with buffer after it printed.  So it (brokenly) showed the last
overhead again.

The bug was there from the beginning, but I think it's only revealed
when the alignment function was added.
