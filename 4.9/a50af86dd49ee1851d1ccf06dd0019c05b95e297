netvsc: reduce maximum GSO size

Hyper-V (and Azure) support using NVGRE which requires some extra space
for encapsulation headers. Because of this the largest allowed TSO
packet is reduced.

For older releases, hard code a fixed reduced value.  For next release,
there is a better solution which uses result of host offload
negotiation.
