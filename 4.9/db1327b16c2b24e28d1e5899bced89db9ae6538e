xfs: report shared extent mappings to userspace correctly

Report shared extents through the iomap interface so that FIEMAP flags
shared blocks accurately.  Have xfs_vm_bmap return zero for reflinked
files because the bmap-based swap code requires static block mappings,
which is incompatible with copy on write.

NOTE: Existing userspace bmap users such as lilo will have the same
problem with reflink files.
