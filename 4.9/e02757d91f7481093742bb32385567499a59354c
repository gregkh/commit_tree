drm/i915/guc: add engine mask to GuC client & pass to GuC

The Context Descriptor passed by the kernel to the GuC contains a field
specifying which engine(s) the context will use. Historically, this was
always set to "all of them", but if we had a separate client for each
engine, we could be more precise, and set only the bit for the engine
that the client was associated with. So this patch enables this usage,
in preparation for having multiple clients, though at this point there
is still only a single client used for all supported engines.
