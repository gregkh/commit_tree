staging: lustre: lmv: access lum_stripe_offset as little endian

By the time that a struct lmv_user_md reaches lmv_placement_policy()
it has already been converted to little endian. Therefore use the
appropriate macros around accesses to this this field. This issue was
found by rewriting the definition of struct lmv_user_md to use the
__leXX typedefs and running sparse.
