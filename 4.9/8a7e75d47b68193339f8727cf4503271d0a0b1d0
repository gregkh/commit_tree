KVM: Add provisioning for ulong vm stats and u64 vcpu stats

vms and vcpus have statistics associated with them which can be viewed
within the debugfs. Currently it is assumed within the vcpu_stat_get() and
vm_stat_get() functions that all of these statistics are represented as
u32s, however the next patch adds some u64 vcpu statistics.

Change all vcpu statistics to u64 and modify vcpu_stat_get() accordingly.
Since vcpu statistics are per vcpu, they will only be updated by a single
vcpu at a time so this shouldn't present a problem on 32-bit machines
which can't atomically increment 64-bit numbers. However vm statistics
could potentially be updated by multiple vcpus from that vm at a time.
To avoid the overhead of atomics make all vm statistics ulong such that
they are 64-bit on 64-bit systems where they can be atomically incremented
and are 32-bit on 32-bit systems which may not be able to atomically
increment 64-bit numbers. Modify vm_stat_get() to expect ulongs.
