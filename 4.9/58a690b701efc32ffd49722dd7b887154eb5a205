crypto: ccp - Refactor the storage block allocation code

Move the KSB access/management functions to the v3
device file, and add function pointers to the actions
structure. At the operations layer all of the references
to the storage block will be generic (virtual). This is
in preparation for a version 5 device, in which the
private storage block is managed differently.
