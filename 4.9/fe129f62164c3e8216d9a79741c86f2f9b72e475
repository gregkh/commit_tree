staging: unisys: visorbus: Remove unnecessary EXPORT_SYMBOL statements

The driver that is now visorbus started out as multiple separate drivers,
and when they were merged the EXPORT_SYMBOL statements that were required
for separate drivers were left in the code. This patch removes those now
unnecessary exports.
