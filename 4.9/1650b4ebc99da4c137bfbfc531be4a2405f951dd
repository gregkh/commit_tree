KVM: Disable irq while unregistering user notifier

Function user_notifier_unregister should be called only once for each
registered user notifier.

Function kvm_arch_hardware_disable can be executed from an IPI context
which could cause a race condition with a VCPU returning to user mode
and attempting to unregister the notifier.
