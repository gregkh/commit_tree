virtio_pci: Limit DMA mask to 44 bits for legacy virtio devices

Legacy virtio defines the virtqueue base using a 32-bit PFN field, with
a read-only register indicating a fixed page size of 4k.

This can cause problems for DMA allocators that allocate top down from
the DMA mask, which is set to 64 bits. In this case, the addresses are
silently truncated to 44-bit, leading to IOMMU faults, failure to read
from the queue or data corruption.

This patch restricts the coherent DMA mask for legacy PCI virtio devices
to 44 bits, which matches the specification.
