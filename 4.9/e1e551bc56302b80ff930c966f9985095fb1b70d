xfrm: policy: prepare policy_bydst hash for rcu lookups

Since commit 56f047305dd4b6b617
("xfrm: add rcu grace period in xfrm_policy_destroy()") xfrm policy
objects are already free'd via rcu.

In order to make more places lockless (i.e. use rcu_read_lock instead of
grabbing read-side of policy rwlock) we only need to:

- use rcu_assign_pointer to store address of new hash table backend memory
- add rcu barrier so that freeing of old memory is delayed (expansion
  and free happens from system workqueue, so synchronize_rcu is fine)
- use rcu_dereference to fetch current address of the hash table.
