coresight: Remove erroneous dma_free_coherent in tmc_probe

commit de5461970b3e9e194 ("coresight: tmc: allocating memory when needed")
removed the static allocation of buffer for the trace data in ETR mode in
tmc_probe. However it failed to remove the "devm_free_coherent" in
tmc_probe when the probe fails due to other reasons. This patch gets
rid of the incorrect dma_free_coherent() call.
