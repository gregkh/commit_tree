drm/i915: Limit fb x offset due to fences

If there's a fence on the object it will be aligned to the start
of the object, and hence CPU rendering to any fb that straddles
the fence edge will come out wrong due to lines wrapping at the
wrong place.

We have no API to manage fences on a sub-object level, so we can't
really fix this in any way. Additonally gen2/3 fences are rather
coarse grained so adjusting the offset migth not even be possible.

Avoid these problems by requiring the fb layout to agree with the
fence layout (if present).

v2: Rebase due to i915_gem_object_get_tiling() & co.
