[media] s5p-jpeg: only fill driver's name in capabilities driver field

The driver fills in both the struct v4l2_capability driver and card fields
the same values, that is the driver's name plus the information if the dev
is a decoder or an encoder.

But the driver field has a fixed length of 16 bytes so the filled data is
truncated:

Driver Info (not using libv4l2):
        Driver name   : s5p-jpeg decode
        Card type     : s5p-jpeg decoder
        Bus info      : platform:11f50000.jpeg
        Driver version: 4.7.0

Also, this field should only contain the driver's name so use just that.
The information if the device is a decoder or an encoder is in the card
type field anyways.
