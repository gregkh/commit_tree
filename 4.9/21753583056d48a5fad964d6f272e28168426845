h8300: fix syscall restarting

Back in commit f56141e3e2d9 ("all arches, signal: move restart_block to
struct task_struct"), all architectures and core code were changed to
use task_struct::restart_block.  However, when h8300 support was
subsequently restored in v4.2, it was not updated to account for this,
and maintains thread_info::restart_block, which is not kept in sync.

This patch drops the redundant restart_block from thread_info, and moves
h8300 to the common one in task_struct, ensuring that syscall restarting
always works as expected.
