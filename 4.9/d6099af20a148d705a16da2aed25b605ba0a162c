staging: lustre: Remove static declaration in anonymous union

It is not permitted in C++ to have a static declaration inside
of an anonymous union. The g++ compiler will complaine with an
error like this:

 error: struct ost_id::<anonymous union>::ostid invalid; an
 anonymous union can only have non-static data members [-fpermissive]

This patch changes the code to use an unnamed struct in place of
"struct ostid" inside of the anonymous union. That name declaration
was completely unnecessary anyway, since it was not used anywhere else.
