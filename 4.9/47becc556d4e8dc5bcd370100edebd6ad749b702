greybus: power_supply: convert greybus properties to power supply properties

We need to translate greybus properties to power supply core properties,
for that when parsing the properties that were fetch during
configuration we check if there is a match to the running kernel version
and store it in a new field (gb_prop) in the gb_power_supply_prop
struct.

If the corresponding property does not exist in the running
kernel (because of version or vendor specific property) we drop that
property.

A collection of properties that, at this time, may diverge are defined
in the kernel_ver.h to avoid breakage at build time and run time if this
properties are not supported by the kernel.
