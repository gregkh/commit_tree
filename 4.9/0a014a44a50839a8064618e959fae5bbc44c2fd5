NFSv4.1: Don't deadlock the state manager on the SEQUENCE status flags

As described in RFC5661, section 18.46, some of the status flags exist
in order to tell the client when it needs to acknowledge the existence of
revoked state on the server and/or to recover state.
Those flags will then remain set until the recovery procedure is done.

In order to avoid looping, the client therefore needs to ignore
those particular flags while recovering.
