netfilter: xt_socket: fix transparent match for IPv6 request sockets

The introduction of TCP_NEW_SYN_RECV state, and the addition of request
sockets to the ehash table seems to have broken the --transparent option
of the socket match for IPv6 (around commit a9407000).

Now that the socket lookup finds the TCP_NEW_SYN_RECV socket instead of the
listener, the --transparent option tries to match on the no_srccheck flag
of the request socket.

Unfortunately, that flag was only set for IPv4 sockets in tcp_v4_init_req()
by copying the transparent flag of the listener socket. This effectively
causes '-m socket --transparent' not match on the ACK packet sent by the
client in a TCP handshake.

Based on the suggestion from Eric Dumazet, this change moves the code
initializing no_srccheck to tcp_conn_request(), rendering the above
scenario working again.
