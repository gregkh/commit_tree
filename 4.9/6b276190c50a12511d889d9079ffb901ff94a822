net/mlx5: Avoid passing dma address 0 to firmware

Currently the firmware can't work with a page with dma address 0.
Passing such an address to the firmware will cause the give_pages
command to fail.

To avoid this, in case we get a 0 dma address of a page from the
dma engine, we avoid passing it to FW by remapping to get an address
other than 0.
