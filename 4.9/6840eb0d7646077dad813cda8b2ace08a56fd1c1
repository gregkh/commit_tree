arm64: dts: rockchip: support the pmu node for rk3399

This patch adds to enable the ARM Performance Monitor Units for rk3399.
ARM cores often have a PMU for counting cpu and cache events like cache
misses and hits.

This uses the new interrupt-partition mechanism to allow the two pmu
instances to use the per-cpu interrupt.
