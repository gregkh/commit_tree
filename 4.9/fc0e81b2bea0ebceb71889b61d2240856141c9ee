x86/traps: Ignore high word of regs->cs in early_fixup_exception()

On the 80486 DX, it seems that some exceptions may leave garbage in
the high bits of CS.  This causes sporadic failures in which
early_fixup_exception() refuses to fix up an exception.

As far as I can tell, this has been buggy for a long time, but the
problem seems to have been exacerbated by commits:

  1e02ce4cccdc ("x86: Store a per-cpu shadow copy of CR4")
  e1bfc11c5a6f ("x86/init: Fix cr4_init_shadow() on CR4-less machines")

This appears to have broken for as long as we've had early
exception handling.

[ Note to stable maintainers: This patch is needed all the way back to 3.4,
  but it will only apply to 4.6 and up, as it depends on commit:

    0e861fbb5bda ("x86/head: Move early exception panic code into early_fixup_exception()")

  If you want to backport to kernels before 4.6, please don't backport the
  prerequisites (there was a big chain of them that rewrote a lot of the
  early exception machinery); instead, ask me and I can send you a one-liner
  that will apply. ]
