mlxsw: spectrum: Fix misuse of hard_header_len

In order to specify that the mlxsw spectrum driver needs additional
headroom for packets, there have been use of the hard_header_len field of
the netdevice struct.

This commit changes that to use needed_headroom instead, as this is the
correct way to do that.
