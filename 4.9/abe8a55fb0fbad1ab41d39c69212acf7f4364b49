staging: lustre: lnet: Enable setting per NI peer_credits

The code to allow peer_credits to be set per NI was originally
"left inactive" because there were concerns about peer_credits
interfering with the ability for IB nodes to connect to each
other when peer_credits are not the same (peer_credits controls
the queue depth for IB). With LU-3322, the values do not have
to match so it is now safe to enable this code so peer_credits
can be set per NI.

This patch enables existing code for setting per NI peer_credits.

Second this patch fixes a long standing bug in that the conf data
was not being used to set variables in the lnet_ni structure until
after lnd_startup() was called which meant LND drivers were
ignoring struct lnet_ni tunable values being set. Now we change
struct lnet_ni data fields based on conf data before calling
lnd_startup().
