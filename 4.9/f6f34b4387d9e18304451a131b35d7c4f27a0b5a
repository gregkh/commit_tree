mm: introduce arch_reserved_kernel_pages()

Currently arch specific code can reserve memory blocks but
alloc_large_system_hash() may not take it into consideration when sizing
the hashes.  This can lead to bigger hash than required and lead to no
available memory for other purposes.  This is specifically true for
systems with CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT enabled.

One approach to solve this problem would be to walk through the memblock
regions and calculate the available memory and base the size of hash
system on the available memory.

The other approach would be to depend on the architecture to provide the
number of pages that are reserved.  This change provides hooks to allow
the architecture to provide the required info.
