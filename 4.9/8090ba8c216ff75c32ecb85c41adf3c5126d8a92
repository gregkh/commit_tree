drm/i915: Apply the PPS register unlock workaround more consistently

Atm, we apply this workaround somewhat inconsistently at the following
points: driver loading, LVDS init, eDP PPS init, system resume. As this
workaround also affects registers other than PPS (timing, PLL) a more
consistent way is to apply it early after the PPS HW context is known to
be lost: driver loading, system resume and on VLV/CHV/BXT when turning
on power domains.

This is needed by the next patch that removes saving/restoring of the
PP_CONTROL register.

This also removes the incorrect programming of the workaround on HSW+
PCH platforms which don't have the register locking mechanism.

v2: (Ville)
- Don't apply the workaround on BXT.
- Simplify platform checks using HAS_DDI().
v3:
- Move the call of intel_pps_unlock_regs_wa() to the more
  logical vlv_display_power_well_init() (also fixing CHV) (Ville).
