tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: Update suspend/resume for DMA mode

When DMA mode is enabled one need to make sure the DMA channels are idle before
entering suspend mode especially when UART ports which are set as wakeup source
and console port with no_console_suspend is set. This patch takes care of
gracefully releasing DMA channels for the above two cases and start the DMA at
resume.
