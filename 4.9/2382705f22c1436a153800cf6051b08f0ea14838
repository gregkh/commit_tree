mm/nobootmem.c: remove duplicate macro ARCH_LOW_ADDRESS_LIMIT statements

Fix the following bugs:

 - the same ARCH_LOW_ADDRESS_LIMIT statements are duplicated between
   header and relevant source

 - don't ensure ARCH_LOW_ADDRESS_LIMIT perhaps defined by ARCH in
   asm/processor.h is preferred over default in linux/bootmem.h
   completely since the former header isn't included by the latter
