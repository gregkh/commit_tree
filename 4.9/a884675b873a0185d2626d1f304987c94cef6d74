x86/MCE/AMD, EDAC: Handle reserved bank 4 on Fam17h properly

Bank 4 is reserved on family 0x17 and shouldn't generate any MCE
records. However, broken hardware and software is not something unheard
of so warn about bank 4 errors. They shouldn't be coming from bank 4
naturally but users can still use mce_amd_inj to simulate errors from it
for testing purposed.

Also, avoid special handling in the injector mce_amd_inj like it is
being done on the older families.

[ bp: Rewrite commit message and merge into one patch. Use boot_cpu_data. ]
