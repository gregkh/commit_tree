arm64: hw_breakpoint: convert CPU hotplug notifier to new infrastructure

The arm64 hw_breakpoint implementation uses a CPU hotplug notifier to
reset the {break,watch}point registers when CPUs come online.

This patch converts the code to the new hotplug mechanism, whilst moving
the invocation earlier to remove the need to disable IRQs explicitly in
the driver (which could cause havok if we trip a watchpoint in an IRQ
handler whilst restoring the debug register state).
