regmap: Allow longer flag masks for read and write

We currently only support masking the top bit for read and write
flags. Let's make the mask unsigned long and mask the bytes based
on the configured register length to make things more generic.

This allows using regmap for more exotic combinations like SPI
devices that need little endian addressing.
