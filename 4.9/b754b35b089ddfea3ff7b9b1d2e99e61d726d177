vgaarbiter: rst-ifiy and polish kerneldoc

Move the documentation into Documentation/gpu, link it up and pull in
the kernel doc.

No actual text changes except that I did polish the kerneldoc a bit,
especially for vga_client_register().

v2: Remove some rst from vga-switcheroo.rst that I don't understand,
but which seems to be the reason why the new vgaarbiter.rst sometimes
drops out of the sidebar index.

v3: Drop one level of headings and clarify the vgaarb one a bit.

v4: Fix some typos (Sean).
