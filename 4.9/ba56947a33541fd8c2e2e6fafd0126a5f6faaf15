qed: mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_l2.c:112:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'qed_sp_vport_start' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_sriov.c:110:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'qed_iov_is_valid_vfid' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_sriov.c:578:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'qed_iov_set_vfs_to_disable' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_sriov.c:2762:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'qed_iov_vf_flr_cleanup' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
....

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
