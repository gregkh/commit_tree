powerpc/mm: Prevent unlikely crash in copro_calculate_slb()

If a cxl adapter faults on an invalid address for a kernel context, we
may enter copro_calculate_slb() with a NULL mm pointer (kernel
context) and an effective address which looks like a user
address. Which will cause a crash when dereferencing mm. It is clearly
an AFU bug, but there's no reason to crash either. So return an error,
so that cxl can ack the interrupt with an address error.
