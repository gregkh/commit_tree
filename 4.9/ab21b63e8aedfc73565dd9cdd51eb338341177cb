Revert "usbtmc: convert to devm_kzalloc"

This reverts commit e6c7efdcb76f11b04e3d3f71c8d764ab75c9423b.

Turns out it was totally wrong.  The memory is supposed to be bound to
the kref, as the original code was doing correctly, not the
device/driver binding as the devm_kzalloc() would cause.

This fixes an oops when read would be called after the device was
unbound from the driver.
