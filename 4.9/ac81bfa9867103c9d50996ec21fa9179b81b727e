nvme: refactor namespaces to support non-gendisk devices

With LightNVM enabled namespaces, the gendisk structure is not exposed
to the user. This prevents LightNVM users from accessing the NVMe device
driver specific sysfs entries, and LightNVM namespace geometry.

Refactor the revalidation process, so that a namespace, instead of a
gendisk, is revalidated. This later allows patches to wire up the
sysfs entries up to a non-gendisk namespace.
