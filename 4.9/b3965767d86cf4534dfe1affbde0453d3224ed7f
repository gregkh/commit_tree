serial: 8250_port: fix runtime PM use in __do_stop_tx_rs485()

There are calls to serial8250_rpm_{get|put}() in __do_stop_tx_rs485() that are
certainly placed in a wrong location. I dunno how it had been tested with
runtime PM enabled because it is obvious "sleep in atomic context" error.

Besides that serial8250_rpm_get() is called immediately after an IO just
happened. It implies that the device is already powered on, see implementation
of serial8250_em485_rts_after_send() and serial8250_clear_fifos() for the
details.

There is no bug have been seen due to, as I can guess, use of auto suspend mode
when scheduled transaction to suspend is invoked quite lately than it's needed
for a few writes to the port. It might be possible to trigger a warning if
stop_tx_timer fires when device is suspended.

Refactor the code to use runtime PM only in case of timer function.
