Disable the __builtin_return_address() warning globally after all

This affectively reverts commit 377ccbb48373 ("Makefile: Mute warning
for __builtin_return_address(>0) for tracing only") because it turns out
that it really isn't tracing only - it's all over the tree.

We already also had the warning disabled separately for mm/usercopy.c
(which this commit also removes), and it turns out that we will also
want to disable it for get_lock_parent_ip(), that is used for at least
TRACE_IRQFLAGS.  Which (when enabled) ends up being all over the tree.

Steven Rostedt had a patch that tried to limit it to just the config
options that actually triggered this, but quite frankly, the extra
complexity and abstraction just isn't worth it.  We have never actually
had a case where the warning is actually useful, so let's just disable
it globally and not worry about it.
