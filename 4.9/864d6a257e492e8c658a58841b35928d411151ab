staging: lustre: llite: pack suppgid to MDS correctly

The ll_lookup_it() may trigger IT_OPEN RPC to open a file by name.
But at that time, the client does not know the target file's GID,
so it cannot pack the necessary supplementary group ID in the RPC.
Because of missing the supplementary group ID, the RPC maybe fail
for open permission check on the MDS. Under such case, MDS should
return the target file's GID, if the current thread on the client
in the right group (according to the file's GID), the client will
try the IT_OPEN RPC again with the right supplementary group ID.

This patch is also helpful if some other(s) changed the file's GID
after current RPC sent to the MDS with the suppgid as the original
GID by race.
