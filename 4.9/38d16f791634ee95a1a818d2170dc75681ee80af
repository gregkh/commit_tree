ASoC: rt5659: Enable IRQ output for GPIO1 pin

Since it's possible to have an IRQ without enabling JD3, the
GPIO1 pin then would remain its default GPIO function which
is set as an input direction (seeing from rt5659). Meanwhile,
CPU would also listen this connection via its own GPIO input:
      [input]          [input]
    CPU GPIO <--------> RT5659 GPIO1

The result for the IRQ on the CPU side will be unexpectable.

So this patch enables the IRQ output for GPIO1 pin any way
as long as there's an IRQ assigned from platform data or DT:
      [input]          [IRQ output]
    CPU GPIO <--------< RT5659 GPIO1
