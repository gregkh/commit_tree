arm64: Refactor sysinstr exception handling

Right now we trap some of the user space data cache operations
based on a few Errata (ARM 819472, 826319, 827319 and 824069).
We need to trap userspace access to CTR_EL0, if we detect mismatched
cache line size. Since both these traps share the EC, refactor
the handler a little bit to make it a bit more reader friendly.
