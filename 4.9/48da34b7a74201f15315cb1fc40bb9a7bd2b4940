sched: add and use qdisc_skb_head helpers

This change replaces sk_buff_head struct in Qdiscs with new qdisc_skb_head.

Its similar to the skb_buff_head api, but does not use skb->prev pointers.

Qdiscs will commonly enqueue at the tail of a list and dequeue at head.
While skb_buff_head works fine for this, enqueue/dequeue needs to also
adjust the prev pointer of next element.

The ->prev pointer is not required for qdiscs so we can just leave
it undefined and avoid one cacheline write access for en/dequeue.
