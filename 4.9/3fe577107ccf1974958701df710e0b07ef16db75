PM / Domains: Add support for removing PM domains

The genpd framework allows users to add PM domains via the pm_genpd_init()
function, however, there is no corresponding function to remove a PM
domain. For most devices this may be fine as the PM domains are never
removed, however, for devices that wish to populate the PM domains from
within a driver, having the ability to remove a PM domain if the probing
of the device fails or the driver is unloaded is necessary.

Add the function pm_genpd_remove() to remove a PM domain by referencing
it's generic_pm_domain structure. Note that the bulk of the code that
removes the PM domain is placed in a separate local function
genpd_remove() (which is called by pm_genpd_remove()). The code is
structured in this way to prepare for adding another function to remove
a PM domain by provider that will also call genpd_remove(). Note that
users of genpd_remove() must call this function with the mutex,
gpd_list_lock, held.

PM domains can only be removed if the associated provider has been
removed, they are not a parent domain to another PM domain and have no
devices associated with them.
