drm/i915: Suppress DRM_ERROR for D_COMP write on Haswell

The D_COMP (render decompression) register write is followed by a status
check and another error (either that the decompression shutdown or the
lpll is enabled). Since we are followed by another, more pertinent,
error we can reduce the pcode timeout to a debug and squelch a sporadic
error message during suspend.
