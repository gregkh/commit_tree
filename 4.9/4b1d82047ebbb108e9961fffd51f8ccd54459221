greybus: es2: rename es2 data structures

I tried this once before and Greg NAK'd it because at that point the
es2 code was nearly identical to the es1 code.  This is no longer
the case, and we need to diverge further, so I think it's time to go
down that path.

The ap_dev structure changed significantly for ES2 versus ES1 as of
this commit:
    667f8d3 es2.c: create dedicated struct for cport_in and cport_out
Since the structures are no longer the same, they should not have
the same name.

This patch renames three data structures so the "1" is replaced with
a "2", to reflect the Toshiba AP bridge chip revision we are working
with.  The structures are:
    es1_ap_dev -> es2_ap_dev
    es1_cport_in -> es2_cport_in
    es1_cport_out -> es2_cport_out

It changes names of symbols having this type as well.  To finish the
job, all references "ES1" (in comments and in symbol names) have
been switched to use "ES2" instead.

The result is a lot of changes, but they amount to a global search
and replace of "es1" with "es2" (and "ES1" with "ES2"), and the
result has been compile tested.
