ACPI / EC: Fix issues related to boot_ec

There are issues related to the boot_ec:
1. If acpi_ec_remove() is invoked, boot_ec will also be freed, this is not
   expected as the boot_ec could be enumerated via ECDT.
2. Address space handler installation/unstallation lead to unexpected _REG
   evaluations.
This patch adds acpi_is_boot_ec() check to be used to fix the above issues.
However, since acpi_ec_remove() actually won't be invoked, this patch
doesn't handle the reference counting of "struct acpi_ec", it only ensures
the correctness of the boot_ec destruction during the boot.
