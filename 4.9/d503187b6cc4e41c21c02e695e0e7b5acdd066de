of/serial: move earlycon early_param handling to serial

We have multiple "earlycon" early_param handlers - merge the DT one into
the main earlycon one.  It's a cleanup that also will be useful
to defer setting up DT console until ACPI/DT decision is made.

Rename the exported function to avoid clashing with the function from
arch/microblaze/kernel/prom.c
