HID: wacom: Add WACOM_DEVICETYPE_DIRECT for Cintiqs and similar

"Direct" input devices like Cintiqs and Tablet PCs set the INPUT_PROP_DIRECT
property to notify userspace that the sensor and screen are overlaid. This
information can also be useful elsewhere within the kernel driver, however,
so we introduce a new WACOM_DEVICETYPE_DIRECT that signals this to other
kernel code.
