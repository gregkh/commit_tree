ASoC: tas571x: move mixer volume controls from TAS5711 to TAS5717

Channel 1 and 2 Mixer Volume controls (registers 0x72/0x73 and 0x76/0x77)
were wrongly assigned to tas5711_controls in commit f252d2346022
("ASoC: tas571x: add input channel mixer for TAS5717/19")

Therefore move them to tas5717_controls.
