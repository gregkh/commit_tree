ARM: gic-v3: Introduce 32-to-64-bit mappings for GICv3 cpu registers

vgic-v3 save/restore routines are written in such way that they map
arm64 system register naming nicely, but it does not fit to arm
world. To keep virt/kvm/arm/hyp/vgic-v3-sr.c untouched we create a
mapping with a function for each register mapping the 32-bit to the
64-bit accessors.

Please, note that 64-bit wide ICH_LR is split in two 32-bit halves
(ICH_LR and ICH_LRC) accessed independently.
