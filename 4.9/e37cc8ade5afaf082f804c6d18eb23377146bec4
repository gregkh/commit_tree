xfrm: policy: use atomic_inc_not_zero in rcu section

If we don't hold the policy lock anymore the refcnt might
already be 0, i.e. policy struct is about to be free'd.

Switch to atomic_inc_not_zero to avoid this.

On removal policies are already unlinked from the tables (lists)
before the last _put occurs so we are not supposed to find the same
'dead' entry on the next loop, so its safe to just repeat the lookup.
