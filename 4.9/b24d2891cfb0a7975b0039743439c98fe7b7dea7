rxrpc: Preset timestamp on Tx sk_buffs

Set the timestamp on sk_buffs holding packets to be transmitted before
queueing them because the moment the packet is on the queue it can be seen
by the retransmission algorithm - which may see a completely random
timestamp.

If the retransmission algorithm sees such a timestamp, it may retransmit
the packet and, in future, tell the congestion management algorithm that
the retransmit timer expired.
