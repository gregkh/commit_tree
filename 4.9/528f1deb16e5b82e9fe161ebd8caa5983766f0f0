IB/hns: Add support of ACPI to the Hisilicon RoCE driver

This patch is meant to add support of ACPI to the Hisilicon RoCE
driver.

Changes done are primarily meant to detect the type and then either
use DT specific or ACPI spcific functions. Where ever possible,
this patch tries to make use of Unified Device Property Interface
APIs to support both DT and ACPI through single interface.

This patch depends upon HNS ethernet driver to Reset RoCE. This
function within HNS ethernet driver has also been enhanced to
support ACPI and is part of other accompanying patch with this
patch-set.
