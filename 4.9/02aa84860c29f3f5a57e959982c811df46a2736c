dmaengine: virt-dma: move function declarations

We get 2 warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/dma/virt-dma.c:22:14: warning: no previous prototype for 'vchan_tx_submit' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/dma/virt-dma.c:52:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'vchan_tx_desc_free' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, these two functions are incorrectly declared in a function.

So this patch moves function declarations out of this function.
