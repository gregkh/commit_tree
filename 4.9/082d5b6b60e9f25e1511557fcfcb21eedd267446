mm/hugetlb: check for reserved hugepages during memory offline

In dissolve_free_huge_pages(), free hugepages will be dissolved without
making sure that there are enough of them left to satisfy hugepage
reservations.

Fix this by adding a return value to dissolve_free_huge_pages() and
checking h->free_huge_pages vs.  h->resv_huge_pages.  Note that this may
lead to the situation where dissolve_free_huge_page() returns an error
and all free hugepages that were dissolved before that error are lost,
while the memory block still cannot be set offline.

Fixes: c8721bbb ("mm: memory-hotplug: enable memory hotplug to handle hugepage")
