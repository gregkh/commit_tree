drm/i915: Start passing around i915_vma from execbuffer

During execbuffer we look up the i915_vma in order to reserve them in
the VM. However, we then do a double lookup of the vma in order to then
pin them, all because we lack the necessary interfaces to operate on
i915_vma - so introduce i915_vma_pin()!

v2: Tidy parameter lists to remove one level of redirection in the hot
path.
