staging: lustre: ldlm: evict clients returning errors on ASTs

To test proper behavior of clients returning errors on ASTs
we can induce a failure with setting OBD_FAIL_LDLM_BL_CALLBACK_NET.
Handle the new additonal case of cfs_fail_err being set as well
so that the cfs_fail_err can be sent back in a reply.
