drm/i915: Convert non-blocking waits for requests over to using RCU

We can completely avoid taking the struct_mutex around the non-blocking
waits by switching over to the RCU request management (trading the mutex
for a RCU read lock and some complex atomic operations). The improvement
is that we gain further contention reduction, and overall the code
become simpler due to the reduced mutex dancing.

v2: Move i915_gem_fault tracepoint back to the start of the function,
before the unlocked wait.
