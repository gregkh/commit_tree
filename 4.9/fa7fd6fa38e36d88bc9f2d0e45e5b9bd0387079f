PM / sleep: enable suspend-to-idle even without registered suspend_ops

Suspend-to-idle (aka the "freeze" sleep state) is a system sleep state
in which all of the processors enter deepest possible idle state and
wait for interrupts right after suspending all the devices.

There is no hard requirement for a platform to support and register
platform specific suspend_ops to enter suspend-to-idle/freeze state.
Only deeper system sleep states like PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY and
PM_SUSPEND_MEM rely on such low level support/implementation.

suspend-to-idle can be entered as along as all the devices can be
suspended. This patch enables the support for suspend-to-idle even on
systems that don't have any low level support for deeper system sleep
states and/or don't register any platform specific suspend_ops.
