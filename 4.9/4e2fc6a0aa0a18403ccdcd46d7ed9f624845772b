ACPICA: Clib/EFI: Fix wrong order of standard integer types/IO handles

ACPICA commit 7f9b359b7c78c69b07f62eb2d58f710c351fd75d

EFI header should use standard C library stuffs (integer types and IO
handles) rather than implementing such standard stuffs.
This patch fixes this issue by:
1. Implementing standard integer types for ACPI_USE_STANDARD_HADERS=n;
2. Defining EFI types using standard integer types and standard IO handles;
3. Tuning header inclusion order and environment definition order;
4. Removing wrong standard header inclusion from ACPICA core files;
5. Moving several application headers from acpidump.h to acenv.h.
This patch corrects some of them. Lv Zheng.

Except some harmless header inclusion re-ordering, Linux kernel is not
affected by this change.
