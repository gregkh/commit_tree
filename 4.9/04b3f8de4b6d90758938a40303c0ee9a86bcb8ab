bpf: drop unnecessary test in cls_bpf_classify and tcf_bpf

The skb_mac_header_was_set() test in cls_bpf's and act_bpf's fast-path is
actually unnecessary and can be removed altogether. This was added by
commit a166151cbe33 ("bpf: fix bpf helpers to use skb->mac_header relative
offsets"), which was later on improved by 3431205e0397 ("bpf: make programs
see skb->data == L2 for ingress and egress"). We're always guaranteed to
have valid mac header at the time we invoke cls_bpf_classify() or tcf_bpf().

Reason is that since 6d1ccff62780 ("net: reset mac header in dev_start_xmit()")
we do skb_reset_mac_header() in __dev_queue_xmit() before we could call
into sch_handle_egress() or any subsequent enqueue. sch_handle_ingress()
always sees a valid mac header as well (things like skb_reset_mac_len()
would badly fail otherwise). Thus, drop the unnecessary test in classifier
and action case.
