ACPI / EC: Add EC_FLAGS_QUERY_ENABLED to reveal a hidden logic

There is a hidden logic in the EC driver:
1. During boot, EC_FLAGS_QUERY_PENDING is responsible for blocking event
   handling;
2. During suspend, EC_FLAGS_STARTED is responsible for blocking event
   handling.
This patch uses a new EC_FLAGS_QUERY_ENABLED flag to make this hidden
logic explicit and have code cleaned up. No functional change.
