arm64: dts: rockchip: fix the address map for WDT0 and WDT1

Due to incorrect description in the TRM, the WDTs base address
should be fixed and swap them like this:
WDT0 - 0xff848000
WDT1 - 0xff840000

And, it is right that only WDT0 can generate global software reset.
We will update the TRM to fix it.
