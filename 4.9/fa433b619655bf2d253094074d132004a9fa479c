greybus: control: Add TimeSync get-last-event logic

gb_control_timesync_get_last_event() sends a request asking for the
FrameTime at the last SVC strobe event. The responding entity returns the
FrameTime in the response phase of the request. Performing this operation
to an Interface after previously:

1. Synchronizing time using timesync-enable/timesync-authoritative
2. Sending an SVC_TIMESYNC_PING

will return the FrameTime of the responding entity at the SVC-ping. If
this command is sent before synchronization has been initiated or
successfully completed the responding entity should return an error
code.

- control.c::gb_control_timesync_get_last_event(u64 *frame_time)
  Returns the FrameTime at the last SVC_TIMESYNC_PING to the AP Module.
