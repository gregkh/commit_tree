KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Change vcore element runnable_threads from linked-list to array

The struct kvmppc_vcore is a structure used to store various information
about a virtual core for a kvm guest. The runnable_threads element of the
struct provides a list of all of the currently runnable vcpus on the core
(those in the KVMPPC_VCPU_RUNNABLE state). The previous implementation of
this list was a linked_list. The next patch requires that the list be able
to be iterated over without holding the vcore lock.

Reimplement the runnable_threads list in the kvmppc_vcore struct as an
array. Implement function to iterate over valid entries in the array and
update access sites accordingly.
