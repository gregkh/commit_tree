EDAC, wq: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue()

Replace the deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue() with
alloc_ordered_workqueue() with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM. This is the identity
conversion.

It's not recommended to stall it from memory pressure. Hence,
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under memory
pressure.
