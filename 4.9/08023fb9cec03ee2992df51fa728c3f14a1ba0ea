ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Don't attempt to enable schedutil governor as module

The schedutil CPUFreq governor could be built as a module but the change
"cpufreq / sched: Pass flags to cpufreq_update_util()" made it
non-modular so attempting to enable as module leads to a warning:

warning: symbol value 'm' invalid for CPU_FREQ_GOV_SCHEDUTIL
