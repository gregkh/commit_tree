drm/tegra: Fix window[0] base address corruption

Window uses shared stride for UV planes and tegra_dc_window struct
defines array of 2 strides per window. That's not taken in account
during setting up of the window addresses and strides, resulting in
out-of-bounds write of the 3-rd (non-existent) V plane stride that
overwrites Y plane base address.
