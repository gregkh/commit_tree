i2c: tegra: Simplify I2C resume

The I2C adapter is unlocked regardless of whether the tegra_i2c_init()
called during the resume is successful or not. However, if the
tegra_i2c_init() is not successful, then ->is_suspended is not set to
false. Simplify the resume code by only setting ->is_suspended to false
if tegra_i2c_init() is successful and return the error code from
tegra_i2c_init().
