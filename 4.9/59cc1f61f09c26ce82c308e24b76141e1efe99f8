net: sched: convert qdisc linked list to hashtable

Convert the per-device linked list into a hashtable. The primary
motivation for this change is that currently, we're not tracking all the
qdiscs in hierarchy (e.g. excluding default qdiscs), as the lookup
performed over the linked list by qdisc_match_from_root() is rather
expensive.

The ultimate goal is to get rid of hidden qdiscs completely, which will
bring much more determinism in user experience.
