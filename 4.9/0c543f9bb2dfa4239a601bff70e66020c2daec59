greybus: interface: Add quirk for no PM for S2 Loader

S2 Loader doesn't support runtime PM operations currently and we will
fail to suspend/resume the bundle for firmware management protocols.

Once that happens, the bundle and its connections will be pretty much
useless as we would have tried to disable/enable all connections during
such an operation and the S2 loader doesn't expect the connections to go
away during normal operation (except in the case of mode-switch).

This patch defines a new quirk GB_INTERFACE_QUIRK_NO_PM and uses a new
interface init status value (GB_INIT_S2_LOADER_INITIALIZED) which will
be advertised by S2 Loader now in the init status.

After detecting the currently running stage as S2 Loader, the kernel
wouldn't attempt suspending or resuming the bundle.
