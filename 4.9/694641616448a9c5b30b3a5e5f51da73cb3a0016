Input: add generic input driver to read encoded GPIO lines

Add a driver to read group of GPIO lines and provide its status as a
numerical value as input event to the system. This will help in
interfacing devices, that can be connected over GPIOs, that provide
input to the system by driving GPIO lines connected to them like a
rotary dial or a switch.

For example, a rotary switch can be connected to four GPIO lines. The
status of the GPIO lines reflect the actual position of the rotary
switch dial. For example, if dial points to 9, then the four GPIO lines
connected to the switch will read HLLH(0b'1001 = 9). This value
can be reported as an ABS_* event to the input subsystem.
