fs: update atime before I/O in generic_file_read_iter

After the call to ->direct_IO the final reference to the file might have
been dropped by aio_complete already, and the call to file_accessed might
cause a use after free.

Instead update the access time before the I/O, similar to how we
update the time stamps before writes.
