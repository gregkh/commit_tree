IB/mlx5: Use cache line size to select CQE stride

When creating kernel CQs use 128B CQE stride if the
cache line size is 128B, 64B otherwise.  This prevents
multiple CQEs from residing in a 128B cache line,
which can cause retries when there are concurrent
read and writes in one cache line.

Tested with IPoIB on PPC64, saw ~5% throughput
improvement.
