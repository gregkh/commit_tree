MIPS: Malta: Fixup reboot

Commit 10b6ea0959de ("MIPS: Malta: Use syscon-reboot driver to reboot")
converted the Malta board to use the generic syscon-reboot driver to
handle reboots, but incorrectly used the value 0x4d rather than 0x42 as
the magic to write to the reboot register.

I also incorrectly believed that syscon/regmap would default to native
endianness, but this isn't the case. Force this by specifying with a
native-endian property in the devicetree.
