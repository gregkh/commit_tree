scsi: ipr: Don't log unnecessary 9084 error details

A 9084 error gets logged by the ipr adapter when adapter raw mode gets
enabled. A bunch of unformatted hex data also gets logged for this
error, which is of little use, so let's avoid logging it by default in
order to avoid the log getting polluted with useless data.
