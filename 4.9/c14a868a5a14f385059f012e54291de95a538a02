tools/testing/nvdimm: unit test for acpi_nfit_notify()

We have had a couple bugs in this implementation in the past and before
we add another ->notify() implementation for nvdimm devices, lets allow
this routine to be exercised via nfit_test.

Rewrite acpi_nfit_notify() in terms of a generic struct device and
acpi_handle parameter, and then implement a mock acpi_evaluate_object()
that returns a _FIT payload.
