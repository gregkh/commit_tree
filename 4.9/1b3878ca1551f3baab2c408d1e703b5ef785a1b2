tcp: export tcp_tso_autosize() and parameterize minimum number of TSO segments

To allow congestion control modules to use the default TSO auto-sizing
algorithm as one of the ingredients in their own decision about TSO sizing:

1) Export tcp_tso_autosize() so that CC modules can use it.

2) Change tcp_tso_autosize() to allow callers to specify a minimum
   number of segments per TSO skb, in case the congestion control
   module has a different notion of the best floor for TSO skbs for
   the connection right now. For very low-rate paths or policed
   connections it can be appropriate to use smaller TSO skbs.
