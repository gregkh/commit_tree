mfd: arizona: Use suspend_noirq inplace of suspend_late

As runtime PM doesn't function whilst processing system suspend/resume
operations and the Arizona IRQ handlers need runtime PM to function
we must disable IRQs during these operations. Whilst this is
already done in the driver we are using suspend/suspend_late and
resume/resume_noirq to do so which has two problems. Firstly, as
suspend_late is before suspend_noirq that means we still have a
small window where an IRQ can cause issues.  Secondly, if another
suspend_late handler fails after ours has run then (as resume_noirq
will not run) we will make unbalanced calls to enable_irq.

This is all simply fixed by using the suspend_noirq callback rather
than suspend_late. Whilst we are doing this tidy the code up a little,
and use the appropriate helper macros.
