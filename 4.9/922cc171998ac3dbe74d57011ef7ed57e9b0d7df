ARC: timer: rtc: implement read loop in "C" vs. inline asm

The current code doesn't even compile as somehow the inline assembly
can't see the register names defined as ARC_RTC_*
I'm pretty sure It worked when I first got it merged, but the tools were
definitely different then.

So better to write this in "C" anyways.
