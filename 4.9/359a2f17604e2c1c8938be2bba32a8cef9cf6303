regmap: debugfs: Add support for dumping write only device registers

Add support for dumping write only device registers in debugfs. This is
useful for audio codecs that have write only registers (like WM8731).
The logic that decides if a value can be printed is moved to
regmap_printable() function to allow for easier future updates.
