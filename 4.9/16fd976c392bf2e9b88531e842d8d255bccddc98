greybus: arche-platform: Do not assert wake/detect signal to SVC

With new definition of AP module boot flow (from HotPlug camp),
AP is not supposed to send any wake/detect signal to SVC, instead,
during boot SVC would straight away send wake_out pulse on wake/detect
line.
Note that, pin configuration of wake/detect line would be set to
active-high by default, so wake/detect line would always stay high,
unless SVC drives it. AP module uses wake/detect line strictly in input
mode.

Testing Done: Tested on EVT1.5 platform.

Note: We are yet to decide on PM support for APBx, so we may need to
generate/handshake with SVC over wake/detect line in the future. As of
now, follow the implementation and add stuff as and when they come.
