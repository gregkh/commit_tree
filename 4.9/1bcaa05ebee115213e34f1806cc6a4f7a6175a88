Revert "HID: dragonrise: fix HID Descriptor for 0x0006 PID"

This reverts commit 18339f59c3a6 ("HID: dragonrise: fix HID...") because it
breaks certain dragonrise 0079:0006 gamepads. While it may fix a breakage
caused by commit 79346d620e9d ("HID: input: force generic axis to be mapped
to their user space axis"), it is probable that the manufacturer released
different hardware with the same PID so this fix works for only a subset
and breaks the other gamepads sharing the PID.

What is needed is another more generic solution which fixes 79346d620e9d
("HID: input: force generic axis ...") breakage for this controller: we
need to add an exception for this driver to make it keep the old behaviour
previous to the initial breakage (this is done in patch 2 of this series).
