openvswitch: 802.1AD Flow handling, actions, vlan parsing, netlink attributes

Add support for 802.1ad including the ability to push and pop double
tagged vlans. Add support for 802.1ad to netlink parsing and flow
conversion. Uses double nested encap attributes to represent double
tagged vlan. Inner TPID encoded along with ctci in nested attributes.

This is based on Thomas F Herbert's original v20 patch. I made some
small clean ups and bug fixes.
