mm, compaction: rename COMPACT_PARTIAL to COMPACT_SUCCESS

COMPACT_PARTIAL has historically meant that compaction returned after
doing some work without fully compacting a zone.  It however didn't
distinguish if compaction terminated because it succeeded in creating
the requested high-order page.  This has changed recently and now we
only return COMPACT_PARTIAL when compaction thinks it succeeded, or the
high-order watermark check in compaction_suitable() passes and no
compaction needs to be done.

So at this point we can make the return value clearer by renaming it to
COMPACT_SUCCESS.  The next patch will remove some redundant tests for
success where compaction just returned COMPACT_SUCCESS.
