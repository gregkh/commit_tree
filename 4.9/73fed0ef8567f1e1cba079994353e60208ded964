drm/i915/gen9: fix the watermark res_blocks value

We forgot the "res_blocks += y_tile_minimum" that's described on step
V of our documentation.

Again, this should only affect the Y tiling cases.

It looks like the relevant code was introduced in 0fda65680e92, but
there's always the possibility that it matched our specification when
it was introduced, and then the specification changed while the code
stayed the same. So we can't really say this was a regression, but
let's try to add a "Fixes" tag anyway to help backporting.

v2: Try to add a "Fixes" tag (Maarten).
