clk: berlin: Migrate to clk_hw based registration and OF APIs

Now that we have clk_hw based provider APIs to register clks, we
can get rid of struct clk pointers while registering clks in
these drivers, allowing us to move closer to a clear split of
consumer and provider clk APIs. We also remove some __init
markings in header files as they're useless and we're in the
area.
