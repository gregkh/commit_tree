acpi, nfit: fix extended status translations for ACPI DSMs

ACPI DSMs can have an 'extended' status which can be non-zero to convey
additional information about the command. In the xlat_status routine,
where we translate the command statuses, we were returning an error for
a non-zero extended status, even if the primary status indicated success.

Return from each command's 'case' once we have verified both its status
and extend status are good.
