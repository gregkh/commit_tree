include/linux/ctype.h: make isdigit() table lookupless

Make isdigit into a simple range checking inline function:

	return '0' <= c && c <= '9';

This code is 1 branch, not 2 because any reasonable compiler can
optimize this code into SUB+CMP, so the code

	while (isdigit((c = *s++)))
		...

remains 1 branch per iteration HOWEVER it suddenly doesn't do table
lookup priming cacheline nobody cares about.
