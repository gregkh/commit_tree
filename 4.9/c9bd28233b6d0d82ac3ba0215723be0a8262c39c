irda: fix overly long udelay()

irda_get_mtt() returns a hardcoded '10000' in some cases,
and with gcc-7, we get a build error because this triggers a
compile-time check in udelay():

drivers/net/irda/w83977af_ir.o: In function `w83977af_hard_xmit':
w83977af_ir.c:(.text.w83977af_hard_xmit+0x14c): undefined reference to `__bad_udelay'

Older compilers did not run into this because they either did not
completely inline the irda_get_mtt() or did not consider the
10000 value a constant expression.

The code has been wrong since the start of git history.
