btrfs: fix WARNING in btrfs_select_ref_head()

This issue was found when testing in-band dedupe enospc behaviour,
sometimes run_one_delayed_ref() may fail for enospc reason, then
__btrfs_run_delayed_refs（）will return, but forget to add num_heads_read
back, which will trigger "WARN_ON(delayed_refs->num_heads_ready == 0)" in
btrfs_select_ref_head().
