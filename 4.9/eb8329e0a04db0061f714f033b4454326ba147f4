tcp: export data delivery rate

This commit export two new fields in struct tcp_info:

  tcpi_delivery_rate: The most recent goodput, as measured by
    tcp_rate_gen(). If the socket is limited by the sending
    application (e.g., no data to send), it reports the highest
    measurement instead of the most recent. The unit is bytes per
    second (like other rate fields in tcp_info).

  tcpi_delivery_rate_app_limited: A boolean indicating if the goodput
    was measured when the socket's throughput was limited by the
    sending application.

This delivery rate information can be useful for applications that
want to know the current throughput the TCP connection is seeing,
e.g. adaptive bitrate video streaming. It can also be very useful for
debugging or troubleshooting.
