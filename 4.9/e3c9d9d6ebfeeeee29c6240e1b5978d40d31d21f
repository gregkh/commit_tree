ARM: dts: imx53-qsb: Fix regulator constraints

Since commit fa93fd4ecc9c ("regulator: core: Ensure we are at least in
bounds for our constraints") the imx53-qsb board populated with a Dialog
DA9053 PMIC fails to boot:

LDO3: Bringing 3300000uV into 1800000-1800000uV

The LDO3 voltage constraints passed in the device tree do not match
the valid range according to the datasheet, so fix this accordingly to
allow the board booting again.

While at it, fix the other voltage constraints as well.
