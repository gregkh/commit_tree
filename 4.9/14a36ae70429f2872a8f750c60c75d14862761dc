greybus: tracing: assign "parent" id first

Most abstractions to be traced will have a sort of "parent" object
it is associated with, and an identifier for that parent is stored
with the as trace event data.  For example, the parent of a message
is the operation it's a part of, and the parent of an operation is
the connection it uses.

We'll arrange to define that parent id first in all events.  Most
abstractions already do this.  Move an interface's module id so it's
defined and assigned first.  The message traces are going to be
changed soon, so leave that one alone.
