lib/win_minmax: windowed min or max estimator

This commit introduces a generic library to estimate either the min or
max value of a time-varying variable over a recent time window. This
is code originally from Kathleen Nichols. The current form of the code
is from Van Jacobson.

A single struct minmax_sample will track the estimated windowed-max
value of the series if you call minmax_running_max() or the estimated
windowed-min value of the series if you call minmax_running_min().

Nearly equivalent code is already in place for minimum RTT estimation
in the TCP stack. This commit extracts that code and generalizes it to
handle both min and max. Moving the code here reduces the footprint
and complexity of the TCP code base and makes the filter generally
available for other parts of the codebase, including an upcoming TCP
congestion control module.

This library works well for time series where the measurements are
smoothly increasing or decreasing.
