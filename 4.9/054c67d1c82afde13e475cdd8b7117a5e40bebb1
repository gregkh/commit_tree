qed*: Add support for ethtool link_ksettings callbacks.

This patch adds the driver implementation for ethtool link_ksettings
callbacks. qed driver now defines/uses the qed specific masks for
representing link capability values. qede driver maps these values to
to new link modes defined by the kernel implementation of link_ksettings.

Please consider applying this to 'net-next' branch.
