kcov: add missing #include <linux/sched.h>

In __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc we use task_struct and fields within it, but
as we haven't included <linux/sched.h>, it is not guaranteed to be
defined.  While we usually happen to acquire the definition through a
transitive include, this is fragile (and hasn't been true in the past,
causing issues with backports).

Include <linux/sched.h> to avoid any fragility.
