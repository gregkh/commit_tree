nfsd4: setclientid_confirm with unmatched verifier should fail

A setclientid_confirm with (clientid, verifier) both matching an
existing confirmed record is assumed to be a replay, but if the verifier
doesn't match, it shouldn't be.

This would be a very rare case, except that clients following
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7931#section-5.8 may depend on the
failure.
