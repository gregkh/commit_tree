selinux: Implementation for inode_copy_up() hook

A file is being copied up for overlay file system. Prepare a new set of
creds and set create_sid appropriately so that new file is created with
appropriate label.

Overlay inode has right label for both context and non-context mount
cases. In case of non-context mount, overlay inode will have the label
of lower file and in case of context mount, overlay inode will have
the label from context= mount option.
