quota: fill in Q_XGETQSTAT inode information for inactive quotas

The manpage for quotactl says that the Q_XGETQSTAT command is
"useful in finding out how much space is spent to store quota
information," but the current implementation does not report this
info if the inode is allocated, but its quota type is not enabled.

This is a change from the earlier XFS implementation, which
reported information about allocated quota inodes even if their
quota type was not currently active.

Change quota_getstate() and quota_getstatev() to copy out the inode
information if the filesystem has provided it, even if the quota
type for that inode is not currently active.
