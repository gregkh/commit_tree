Revert "usb: dwc2: gadget: fix TX FIFO size and address initialization"

This reverts commit aa381a7259c3 ("usb: dwc2: gadget: fix TX FIFO size
and address initialization").

The original commit removed the FIFO size programming per endpoint. The
DPTXFSIZn register is also used for DIEPTXFn and the SIZE field is r/w
in dedicated fifo mode. So it isn't appropriate to simply remove this
initialization as it might break existing behavior.

Also, some cores might not have enough fifo space to handle the
programming method used in the reverted patch, resulting in fifo
initialization failure.
