HID: wacom: use devm_kasprintf for allocating the name of the remote

The sysfs group was indeed removed by kobject_put(wacom->remote_dir) in
wacom_remove(), but the name of the group was never freed.

Also remove the misplaced kobject_put(wacom->remote_dir) in the error
path of wacom_remote_create_attr_group().
