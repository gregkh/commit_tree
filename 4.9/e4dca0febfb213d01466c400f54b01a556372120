PNP: isapnp: make core more explicitly non-modular

The Makefile currently controlling compilation of this code is:

obj-y                   += pnp.o
pnp-y                   := core.o compat.o

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
But we do add moduleparam.h since the file does use module_param().
