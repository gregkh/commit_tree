ACPICA: OSL: Add correct acpi_gbl_debug_timeout export to allow acpiexec to link

ACPICA commit 408198c8c9786f9f104ee925020c3ab1701906e4

The acpi_gbl_debug_timeout which is used by acpiexec -et option now is only
implemented in oswinxf.c and used for WIN32 builds. This makes it very
difficult to remember that we need to add this variable to other os
specific layer files in order for linking. This patch makes it a global
option dependent on ACPI_APPLICATION so that it can always be linked by the
applications. Lv Zheng.
