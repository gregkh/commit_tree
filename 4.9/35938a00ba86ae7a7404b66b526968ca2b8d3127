MIPS: Fix ISA I FP sigcontext access violation handling

Complement commit 0ae8dceaebe3 ("Merge with 2.3.10.") and use the local
`fault' handler to recover from FP sigcontext access violation faults,
like corresponding code does in r4k_fpu.S.  The `bad_stack' handler is
in syscall.c and is not suitable here as we want to propagate the error
condition up through the caller rather than killing the thread outright.
