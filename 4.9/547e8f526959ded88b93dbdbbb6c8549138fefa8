ARM: imx: add cpuidle support for i.mx6ul

This patch enables cpuidle driver for i.MX6UL, it
reuses i.MX6SX's cpuidle driver, 3 levels of cpuidle
supported:

1. ARM WFI;
2. SOC in WAIT mode;
3. SOC in WAIT mode + ARM power off.

As i.MX6UL has cortex-A7 CORE with an internal L2
cache, so flushing it before powering down ARM platform
is necessary, flush_cache_all() in last step of cpu_suspend
has very small overhead, just call it to avoid cache
type check for different platforms.
