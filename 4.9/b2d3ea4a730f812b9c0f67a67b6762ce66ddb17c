tcp: switch back to proper tcp_skb_cb size check in tcp_init()

Revert to the tcp_skb_cb size check that tcp_init() had before commit
b4772ef879a8 ("net: use common macro for assering skb->cb[] available
size in protocol families"). As related commit 744d5a3e9fe2 ("net:
move skb->dropcount to skb->cb[]") explains, the
sock_skb_cb_check_size() mechanism was added to ensure that there is
space for dropcount, "for protocol families using it". But TCP is not
a protocol using dropcount, so tcp_init() doesn't need to provision
space for dropcount in the skb->cb[], and thus we can revert to the
older form of the tcp_skb_cb size check. Doing so allows TCP to use 4
more bytes of the skb->cb[] space.
