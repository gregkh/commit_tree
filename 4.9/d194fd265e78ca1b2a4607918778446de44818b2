qed*: Fix pause setting

When moving into using ethtool's link_ksetting, qed started
supplying its own bitmask of speed/capabilities, but qede
is still checking for the SUPPORTED value to determine whether
it supports pause.

Fixes: 054c67d1c82a ("qed*: Add support for ethtool link_ksettings callbacks")
