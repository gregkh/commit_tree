greybus: firmware.h: rename TFTF firmware filenames

Replace prefix "ara_" with prefix "gmp_" for TFTF firmware filenames.

Testing Done: compiled and flashed EVT2 (bootimage) and tested that
              "gmp_" prefixed tftf files are expected. Pushed one from
	      FDK and checked that it's properly loaded.
