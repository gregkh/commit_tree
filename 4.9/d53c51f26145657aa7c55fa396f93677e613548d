s390/cio: fix accidental interrupt enabling during resume

Since commit 9f3d6d7 chsc_get_channel_measurement_chars is called with
interrupts disabled during resume from hibernate. Since this function
used spin_unlock_irq, interrupts have been enabled accidentally. Fix
this by using the irqsave variant.

Since we can't guarantee the IRQ-enablement state for all (future/
external) callers, change the locking in related functions to prevent
similar bugs in the future.
