bpf: fix map not being uncharged during map creation failure

In map_create(), we first find and create the map, then once that
suceeded, we charge it to the user's RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, and then fetch
a new anon fd through anon_inode_getfd(). The problem is, once the
latter fails f.e. due to RLIMIT_NOFILE limit, then we only destruct
the map via map->ops->map_free(), but without uncharging the previously
locked memory first. That means that the user_struct allocation is
leaked as well as the accounted RLIMIT_MEMLOCK memory not released.
Make the label names in the fix consistent with bpf_prog_load().
