greybus: connection: add latency tag enable/disable callbacks

This patch adds a layered wrapper around optional latency tag
enable/disable commands to APBridge. When set APBridge and GPBridge will
insert timing information into reserved fields in the loopback response
header. Correspondingly when unset no timing information will be included
in the response payload.
