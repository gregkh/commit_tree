vme: change LM callback argument to void pointer

Make the location monitor callback function prototype more useful by
changing the argument from an integer to a void pointer.

All VME bridge drivers were simply passing the location monitor index
(e.g. 0-3) as the argument to these callbacks. It is much more useful
to pass back a pointer to data that the callback-registering driver
cares about.

There appear to be no in-kernel callers of vme_lm_attach (or
vme_lme_request for that matter), so this change only affects the VME
subsystem and bridge drivers.

This has been tested with Tsi148 hardware, but the CA91Cx42 changes
have only been compiled.
