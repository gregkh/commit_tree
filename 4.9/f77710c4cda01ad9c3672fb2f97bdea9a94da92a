watchdog: pretimeout: add noop pretimeout governor

The change adds noop watchdog pretimeout governor, only an
informational message is printed to the kernel log buffer when a
watchdog triggers a pretimeout event.

While introducing the first pretimeout governor the selected design
assumes that the default pretimeout governor is selected by its name
and it is always built-in, thus the default pretimeout governor can
not be unregistered and the correspondent check can be removed from
the watchdog_unregister_governor() function.
