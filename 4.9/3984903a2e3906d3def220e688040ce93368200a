rtc: omap: Fix selecting external osc

RTC can be clocked from an external 32KHz oscillator, or from the
Peripheral PLL. The RTC has an internal oscillator buffer to support
direct operation with a crystal.

The RTC functional clock is sourced by default from the clock derived
from the Peripheral PLL. In order to select source as external osc clk
the following changes needs to be done:
- Enable the RTC OSC (RTC_OSC_REG[4]OSC32K_GZ = 0)
- Enable the clock mux(RTC_OSC_REG[6]K32CLK_EN = 1)
- Select the external clock source (RTC_OSC_REG[3]32KCLK_SEL = 1)
