documentation/scsi: Remove nodisconnect parameter

The driver that used the 'nodisconnect' parameter was removed in
commit 565bae6a4a8f ("[SCSI] 53c7xx: kill driver"). Related documentation
was cleaned up in commit f37a7238d379 ("[SCSI] 53c7xx: fix removal
fallout"), except for the remaining two mentions that are removed here.
