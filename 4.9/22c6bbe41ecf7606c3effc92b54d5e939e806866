Update the maximum depth of C-state from 6 to 9

Hi Jon,

This patch is an old one, we have corrected some minor issues on the newer one.
Please only review the newest version from my last mail with this subject
"[PATCH] ACPI: Update the maximum depth of C-state from 6 to 9".
And I also attached it to this mail.

Thanks,
Baole

Currently, CPUIDLE_STATE_MAX has been defined as 10 in the cpuidle head file,
and max_cstate = CPUIDLE_STATE_MAX – 1, so 9 is the right maximum depth of C-state.
This change is reflected in one place of the kernel-param file,
but not in the other place where I suggest changing.
