mm, oom: get rid of signal_struct::oom_victims

After "oom: keep mm of the killed task available" we can safely detect
an oom victim by checking task->signal->oom_mm so we do not need the
signal_struct counter anymore so let's get rid of it.

This alone wouldn't be sufficient for nommu archs because
exit_oom_victim doesn't hide the process from the oom killer anymore.
We can, however, mark the mm with a MMF flag in __mmput.  We can reuse
MMF_OOM_REAPED and rename it to a more generic MMF_OOM_SKIP.
