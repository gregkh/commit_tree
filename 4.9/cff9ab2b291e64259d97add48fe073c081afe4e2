x86/apic: Get rid of apic_version[] array

The array has a size of MAX_LOCAL_APIC, which can be as large as 32k, so it
can consume up to 128k.

The array has been there forever and was never used for anything useful
other than a version mismatch check which was introduced in 2009.

There is no reason to store the version in an array. The kernel is not
prepared to handle different APIC versions anyway, so the real important
part is to detect a version mismatch and warn about it, which can be done
with a single variable as well.
