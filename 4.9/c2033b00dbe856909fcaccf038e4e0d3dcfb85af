mm, compaction: restrict full priority to non-costly orders

The new ultimate compaction priority disables some heuristics, which may
result in excessive cost.  This is fine for non-costly orders where we
want to try hard before resulting for OOM, but might be disruptive for
costly orders which do not trigger OOM and should generally have some
fallback.  Thus, we disable the full priority for costly orders.
