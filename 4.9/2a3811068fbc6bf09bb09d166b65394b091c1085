ARM: Fix XIP kernels

Commit 7619751f8c90 ("ARM: 8595/2: apply more __ro_after_init") caused
a regression with XIP kernels by moving the __ro_after_init data into
the read-only section.  With XIP kernels, the read-only section is
located in read-only memory from the very beginning.

Work around this by moving the __ro_after_init data back into the .data
section, which will be in RAM, and hence will be writable.

It should be noted that in doing so, this remains writable after init.
