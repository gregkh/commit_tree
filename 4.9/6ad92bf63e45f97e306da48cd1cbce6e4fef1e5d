tools/testing: add a test to check nsfs ioctl-s

There are two new ioctl-s:
One ioctl for the user namespace that owns a file descriptor.
One ioctl for the parent namespace of a namespace file descriptor.

The test checks that these ioctl-s works and that they handle a case
when a target namespace is outside of the current process namespace.
