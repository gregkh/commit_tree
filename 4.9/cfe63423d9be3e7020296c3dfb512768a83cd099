drm/fb-helper: Add drm_fb_helper_set_suspend_unlocked()

This adds a function that also takes the console lock before calling
fb_set_suspend() in contrast to drm_fb_helper_set_suspend() which is
a plain wrapper around fb_set_suspend().
Resume is run asynchronously using a worker if the console lock is
already taken. This is modelled after the i915 driver.
