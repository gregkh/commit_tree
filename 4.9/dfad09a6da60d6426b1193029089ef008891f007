ibmvnic: Handle backing device failover and reinitialization

An upcoming feature of IBM VNIC protocol is the ability to configure
redundant backing devices for a VNIC client. In case of a failure
on the current backing device, the driver will receive a signal
from the hypervisor indicating that a failover will occur. The driver
will then wait for a message from the backing device before
establishing a new connection.
