s390/time: avoid races when updating tb_update_count

The increment might not be atomic and we're not holding the
timekeeper_lock. Therefore we might lose an update to count, resulting in
VDSO being trapped in a loop. As other archs also simply update the
values and count doesn't seem to have an impact on reloading of these
values in VDSO code, let's just remove the update of tb_update_count.
