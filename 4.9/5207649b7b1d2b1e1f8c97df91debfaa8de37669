checkpatch: improve MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE test

It is possible for a multiple line macro definition to have a false positive
report when an argument is used on a line after a continuation \.

This line might have a leading '+' as the initial character that could be
confused by checkpatch as an operator.

Avoid the leading character on multiple line macro definitions.
