Drivers: hv: get rid of timeout in vmbus_open()

vmbus_teardown_gpadl() can result in infinite wait when it is called on 5
second timeout in vmbus_open(). The issue is caused by the fact that gpadl
teardown operation won't ever succeed for an opened channel and the timeout
isn't always enough. As a guest, we can always trust the host to respond to
our request (and there is nothing we can do if it doesn't).
