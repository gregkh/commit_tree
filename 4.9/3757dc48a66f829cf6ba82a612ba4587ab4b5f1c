     unsigned long pfn = __phys_to_pfn(phys_addr);
                   ^~~

The pfn value is only used once in the call to pfn_valid(), remove the
variable and calculate the pfn when it's needed. Note that the kbuild
report is old and PHYS_PFN() is now used instead of __phys_to_pfn() to
calculate the pfn.
