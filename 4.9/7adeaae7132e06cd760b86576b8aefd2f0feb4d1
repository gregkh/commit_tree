greybus: svc: create svc along with host device

Create svc device along with host-device and move the svc-connection to
the svc structure.

The svc connection is enabled when registering the host device, but as
the SVC protocol is currently driven by the SVC, we need to defer
registration of the svc device to the connection request handler.
