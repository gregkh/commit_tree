net/faraday: Separate rx page storage from rxdesc

The ftgmac100 hardware revision in e.g. the Aspeed AST2500 no longer
reserves all bits in RXDES#2 but instead uses the bottom 16 bits to
store MAC frame metadata. Avoid corruption by shifting struct page
pointers out to their own member in struct ftgmac100.
