Btrfs: add a flags field to btrfs_fs_info

We have a lot of random ints in btrfs_fs_info that can be put into flags.  This
is mostly equivalent with the exception of how we deal with quota going on or
off, now instead we set a flag when we are turning it on or off and deal with
that appropriately, rather than just having a pending state that the current
quota_enabled gets set to.  Thanks,
