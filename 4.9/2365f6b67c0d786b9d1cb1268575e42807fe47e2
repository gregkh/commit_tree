KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Support 64kB page size on POWER8E and POWER8NVL

On POWER8E and POWER8NVL, KVM-PR does not announce support for
64kB page sizes and 1TB segments yet. Looks like this has just
been forgotton so far, since there is no reason why this should
be different to the normal POWER8 CPUs.
