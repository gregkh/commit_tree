drm/prime: Take a ref on the drm_dev when exporting a dma_buf

dma_buf may live a long time, longer than the last direct user of the
driver. We already hold a reference to the owner module (that prevents
the object code from disappearing), but there is no reference to the
drm_dev - so the pointers to the driver backend themselves may vanish.

v2: Resist temptation to fix the bug in armada_gem.c not setting the
correct flags on the exported dma-buf (it should pass the flags through
and not be arbitrarily setting O_RDWR).

Use a common wrapper for exporting the dmabuf and acquiring the
reference to the drm_device.
