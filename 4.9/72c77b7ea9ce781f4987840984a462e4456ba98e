ACPI / EC: Cleanup first_ec/boot_ec code

In order to support full ECDT (driving the ECDT EC after probing the
namespace EC), we need to change our EC device alloc/free algorithm, ensure
not to free old boot EC before qualifying new boot EC.
This patch achieves this by cleaning up first_ec/boot_ec logic:
1. first_ec: used to perform transactions, so it is assigned in new
   acpi_ec_setup() function.
2. boot_ec: used to track early EC device, so it is assigned in new
   acpi_config_boot_ec() function which explictly tells the driver to save
   the EC device as early EC device.
