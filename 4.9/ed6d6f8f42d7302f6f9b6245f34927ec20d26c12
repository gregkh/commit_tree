usb: increase ohci watchdog delay to 275 msec

Increase ohci watchout delay to 275 ms. Previous delay was 250 ms
with 20 ms of slack, after removing slack time some ohci controllers don't
respond in time. Logs from systems with controllers that have the
issue would show "HcDoneHead not written back; disabled"
