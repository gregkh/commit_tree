mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: Correct two register accesses

- The DMA error interrupt bit is in a different position as
   compared to the sdhci standard.  This is accounted for in
   many cases, but not handled in the case of clearing the
   INT_STATUS register by writing a 1 to that location.
 - The HOST_CONTROL register is very different as compared to
   the sdhci standard.  This is accounted for in the write
   case, but not when read back out (which it is in the sdhci
   code).
