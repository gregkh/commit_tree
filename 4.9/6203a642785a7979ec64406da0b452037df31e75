Documentation: clk: update file names containing referenced structures

Commit 'b09d6d991' removes include/linux/clk-private.h and
re-arranges the clock related structures contained in it in
different files. The documentation has not been updated
accordingly, thus it wasn't anymore consistent.

Place the structures referenced by Documentation/clk.txt in the
correct files and update their contents to the latest status.
