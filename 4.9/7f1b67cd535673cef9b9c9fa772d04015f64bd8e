greybus: connection: fix protocol tear-down race

Make sure to cancel all active operations before calling protocol
connection_exit to prevent use-after-free issues when the protocol state
is being deallocated (e.g. late processing of already-queued requests or
completions).

Note that already-queued requests or completions will be processed as
part of cancellation.
