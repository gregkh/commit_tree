dsa: mv88e6xxx: Timeout based on iterations, not time

The mv88e6xxx driver times out operations on the switch based on
looping until an elapsed wall clock time is reached. However, if
usleep_range() sleeps much longer than expected, it could timeout with
an error without actually checking to see if the devices has completed
the operation. So replace the elapsed time with a fixed upper bound on
the number of loops.

Testing on various switches has shown that switches takes either 0 or
1 iteration, so a maximum of 16 iterations is a safe limit.
