md-cluster: make resync lock also could be interruptted

When one node is perform resync or recovery, other nodes
can't get resync lock and could block for a while before
it holds the lock, so we can't stop array immediately for
this scenario.

To make array could be stop quickly, we check MD_CLOSING
in dlm_lock_sync_interruptible to make us can interrupt
the lock request.
