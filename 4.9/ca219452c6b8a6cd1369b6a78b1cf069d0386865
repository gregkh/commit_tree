arm64: Correctly bounds check virt_addr_valid

virt_addr_valid is supposed to return true if and only if virt_to_page
returns a valid page structure. The current macro does math on whatever
address is given and passes that to pfn_valid to verify. vmalloc and
module addresses can happen to generate a pfn that 'happens' to be
valid. Fix this by only performing the pfn_valid check on addresses that
have the potential to be valid.
