drm/panel: simple: Add delay timing for Sharp LQ123P1JX31

According to page 16 of the Sharp LQ123P1JX31 datasheet, we need to add
the missing delay timing. Panel prepare time should be t1 (0.5 to 10 ms)
plus t3 (0 to 100 ms), panel enable time should equal to t7 (0 to 50 ms)
and panel unprepare time should be t11 (1 to 50 ms) plus t12 (500 ms).
