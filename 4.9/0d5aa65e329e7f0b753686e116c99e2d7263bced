clk: meson: fix CLKID_GCLK_VENCI_INT typo

The addition of many gate clocks added two entries in an array for
the same value:

drivers/clk/meson/meson8b.c:479:10: error: initialized field overwritten [-Werror=override-init]
   [CLKID_GCLK_VENCI_INT]     = &meson8b_gclk_venci_int.hw,
   [CLKID_GCLK_VENCI_INT]     = &meson8b_gclk_vencp_int.hw,

This was clearly an accident, and since all other identifiers are
listed in the order in which they are defined, I'm changing the
first one to CLKID_GCLK_VENCI_INT0, making it all consistent again.
