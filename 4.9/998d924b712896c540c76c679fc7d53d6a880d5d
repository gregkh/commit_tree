thermal: user_space gov: Add additional information in uevent

Add additional properties:
NAME= Thermal zone type
TEMP= Temperature sample value
TRIP= Violated trip index
EVENT= The notification event (new temperature sample, trip violation
trip changed)

This is the additional information to what kobject_uevent already
provides. So it will not impact existing user spaces.
