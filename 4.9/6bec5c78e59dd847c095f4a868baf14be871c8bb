greybus: svc: Read and clear module's boot status

As per the module's boot sequence diagram, the AP needs to read/clear
T_TstSrcIncrement attribute on hotplug (svc) events.

Implement that.

FIXME: This is module-hardware dependent and needs to be extended for
every type of module we want to support.

[ Based on work by Marti & Eli to clear the attribute with DME set]
