greybus: loopback: add sink to loopback protocol

Loopback sink command will operate as an amalgam of the ping and tranfer
operations. Sink will send an ACK'd variable size operation over greybus.
Unlike the transfer type which transmits the received data back, the sink
type will simply ACK without sending the received data back.

This patch adds the kernel side of the sink command.
