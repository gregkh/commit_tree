drm: Fix plane type uabi breakage

Turns out assuming that only stuff in uabi is uabi is a bit naive, and
we have a bunch of properties for which the enum values are placed in
random headers. A proper fix would be to split out uapi include
headers, but meanwhile sprinkle at least some warning over them.
