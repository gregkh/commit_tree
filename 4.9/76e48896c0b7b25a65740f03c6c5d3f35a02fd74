[media] v4l: vsp1: Support chained display lists

When display lists are linked in a chain, they will be processed
automatically by the hardware, with each list linking to the next. Only
on the last display list will the frame end interrupt be fired to mark
the completion event.

Upon frame-end, the chain will be iterated to release each display list
back to the free list.

The chained lists use case (image partitioning) can require up to 64
lists per frame in the worst case scenario, bump up the number of
preallocated lists.
