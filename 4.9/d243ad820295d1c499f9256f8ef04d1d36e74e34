drm/i915: Mark up the GTT flush following WC writes as ORIGIN_CPU

Similarly to invalidating beforehand, if the object is mmapped via
I915_MMAP_WC we cannot track writes through the I915_GEM_DOMAIN_GTT. At
the conclusion of the write, i915_gem_object_flush_gtt_writes() we also
need to treat the origin carefully in case it may have been untracked.

invalidation on WC mmaps").
