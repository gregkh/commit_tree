drm/exynos: fix pending update handling

Exynos DRM devices update their registers at vblank time. Exynos-DRM uses
custom mechanism to wait for vblank. This mechanism is error prone -
variables are not updated atomically. As a result in certain circumstances
user space can try to free buffers which are still in use by hardware,
in such cases IOMMU can throw OOPS.
The patch instead of fixing the mechanism replaces it with drm core helper.
