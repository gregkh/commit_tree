drm/i915: Distinguish last emitted request from last submitted request

In order not to trigger hangcheck on a idle-but-waiting engine, we need
to distinguish between the pending request queue and the actual
execution queue. This is done later in "drm/i915: Enable multiple
timelines" but for now we need a temporary fix to prevent blaming the
wrong engine for a GPU hang.

(Note that this causes a temporary subtle change in how we decide when
to allow a waitboost to be re-awarded back to the waiter, the temporary
effect is that if the wait is upon the most current execution the wait
is given for free, instead of checking to see if the client stalled
itself. This will be repaired in "drm/i915: Enable multiple timelines".)
