clk: rockchip: mark rk3399 hdcp_noc and vio_noc as critical

The aclk_vio_noc should be put into critical list, as the interconnect
is not handled right now, but is required by VOP.
And the Type-C DP need these clocks: aclk_hdcp_noc, hclk_hdcp_noc,
pclk_hdcp_noc. Mark them as critical to avoid someone close them.
