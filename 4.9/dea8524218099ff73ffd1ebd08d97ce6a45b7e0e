firmware: qcom_scm: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/firmware/Kconfig:config QCOM_SCM
drivers/firmware/Kconfig:       bool

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init was not in use by this code, the init ordering
remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
