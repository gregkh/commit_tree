drm/i915: Don't check for idleness before retiring after a GPU hang

When we force the cleanup after a GPU hang, we want to retire all
requests, or else we may leak them if truly wedged (and the GPU never
advances again). Converting to the active request helpers had the issue
of doing the check against busyness before reporting the request, so if
we claim the GPU had hung but this engine hadn't we could potential skip
the request cleanup - triggering the self-check BUG.
