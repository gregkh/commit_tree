greybus: allocate space without gbufs

This begins the transition to buffer allocation that does not rely
on the gbuf construct.

The host driver allocation routine will return a pointer to the
buffer to be used, and the caller will be responsible for keeping
track of that pointer, as well as the requested buffer size.

Rename the allocation method to reflect it's no longer tied to a
gbuf.
