i2c: designware: detect when dynamic tar update is possible

This adapter can be synthesized with dynamic tar update enabled or disabled.
When enabled it is not necessary to disable the adapter to change the slave
address in some situations, which saves some time per transaction.

There is no direct register to know if this feature is enabled but we can do it
indirectly by writing to the 10BIT_ADDR field in IC_CON: this field is
read only when dynamic tar update is enabled.
