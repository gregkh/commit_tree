tty: serial_core: convert uart_open to use tty_port_open

tty_port_open handles much of the common parts of tty opening. Convert
uart_open to use it and move the serial_core specific parts into
tty_port.activate function. This will be needed to use tty_port functions
directly from in kernel clients.

The tricky part is uart_port_startup can return positive values to allow
setserial to configure the port. We now return the positive value to
tty_port_open so that the tty is not marked as initialized and then set the
return value in uart_open to 0.
