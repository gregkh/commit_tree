mmc: dw_mmc: split out preparation of desc for IDMAC32 and IDMAC64

We intend to add more check for descriptors when
preparing desc. Let's spilt out the separate body
to make the dw_mci_translate_sglist not so lengthy.
After spliting out these two functions, we could
remove dw_mci_translate_sglist and call both of them
when staring idmac.
