device-dax: fix private mapping restriction, permit read-only

Hugh notes in response to commit 4cb19355ea19 "device-dax: fail all
private mapping attempts":

  "I think that is more restrictive than you intended: haven't tried, but I
  believe it rejects a PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, O_RDONLY fd mmap, leaving no
  way to mmap /dev/dax without write permission to it."

Indeed it does restrict read-only mappings, switch to checking
VM_MAYSHARE, not VM_SHARED.
