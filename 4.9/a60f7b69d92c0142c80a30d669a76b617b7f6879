generic syscalls: Wire up memory protection keys syscalls

These new syscalls are implemented as generic code, so enable them for
architectures like arm64 which use the generic syscall table.

According to Arnd:

  Even if the support is x86 specific for the forseeable future, it may be
  good to reserve the number just in case.  The other architecture specific
  syscall lists are usually left to the individual arch maintainers, most a
  lot of the newer architectures share this table.
