scsi: vmw_pvscsi: return SUCCESS for successful command aborts

The vmw_pvscsi driver reports most successful aborts as FAILED to the
scsi error handler.  This is do to a misunderstanding of how
completion_done() works and its interaction with a successful wait using
wait_for_completion_timeout().  The vmw_pvscsi driver is expecting
completion_done() to always return true if complete() has been called on
the completion structure.  But completion_done() returns true after
complete() has been called only if no function like
wait_for_completion_timeout() has seen the completion and cleared it as
part of successfully waiting for the completion.

Instead of using completion_done(), vmw_pvscsi should just use the
return value from wait_for_completion_timeout() to know if the wait
timed out or not.
