PCI: rockchip: Improve the deassert sequence of four reset pins

Per TRM, we need to deassert the four reset pins simultaneously.  Currently
the reset framework doesn't support that so we did it one by one.  It seems
no side effect found but it does impact the state machine of controller, so
sometimes the change speed bit is not set when sending training sequence
from recover state.  After the silicon RTL review from SoC guys, we don't
need to do the sequence recommended by TRM, and could just move the
deassert of mgmt_sticky_rst to the first place.
