mfd: stmpe: Fix RESET regression on STMPE2401

Since commit c4dd1ba355aae2bc3d1213da6c66c53e3c31e028
("mfd: stmpe: Add reset support for all STMPE variant")
we're resetting the STMPE expanders before use.

This caused a regression on the STMP2401 on the Nomadik
NHK8815:

stmpe-i2c 0-0043: stmpe2401 detected, chip id: 0x101
nmk-i2c 101f8000.i2c0: write to slave 0x43 timed out
nmk-i2c 101f8000.i2c0: no ack received after address transmission
stmpe-i2c 0-0044: stmpe2401 detected, chip id: 0x101
nmk-i2c 101f8000.i2c0: write to slave 0x44 timed out
nmk-i2c 101f8000.i2c0: no ack received after address transmission

It turns out that we start to poll for the reset bit to
go low again too quickly: the STMPE2401 is not yet online and
ready to be asked for the status of the RESET bit.

By introducing a 10ms delay before starting to hammer
the register for information, we get back to normal:

stmpe-i2c 0-0043: stmpe2401 detected, chip id: 0x101
stmpe-i2c 0-0044: stmpe2401 detected, chip id: 0x101
