ACPI / CPPC: Allow build with ACPI_CPU_FREQ_PSS config

Some newer x86 platforms have support for both _CPC and _PSS object. So
kernel config can have both ACPI_CPU_FREQ_PSS and ACPI_CPPC_LIB. So remove
restriction for ACPI_CPPC_LIB to build only when ACPI_CPU_FREQ_PSS is not
defined.
Also for legacy systems with only _PSS, we shouldn't bail out if
acpi_cppc_processor_probe() fails, if ACPI_CPU_FREQ_PSS is also defined.
