drm/i915: Simplify ELSP queue request tracking

Emulate HW to track and manage ELSP queue. A set of SW ports are defined
and requests are assigned to these ports before submitting them to HW. This
helps in cleaning up incomplete requests during reset recovery easier
especially after engine reset by decoupling elsp queue management. This
will become more clear in the next patch.

In the engine reset case we want to resume where we left-off after skipping
the incomplete batch which requires checking the elsp queue, removing
element and fixing elsp_submitted counts in some cases. Instead of directly
manipulating the elsp queue from reset path we can examine these ports, fix
up ringbuffer pointers using the incomplete request and restart submissions
again after reset.
