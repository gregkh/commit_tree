bpf: add bpf_skb_change_tail helper

This work adds a bpf_skb_change_tail() helper for tc BPF programs. The
basic idea is to expand or shrink the skb in a controlled manner. The
eBPF program can then rewrite the rest via helpers like bpf_skb_store_bytes(),
bpf_lX_csum_replace() and others rather than passing a raw buffer for
writing here.

bpf_skb_change_tail() is really a slow path helper and intended for
replies with f.e. ICMP control messages. Concept is similar to other
helpers like bpf_skb_change_proto() helper to keep the helper without
protocol specifics and let the BPF program mangle the remaining parts.
A flags field has been added and is reserved for now should we extend
the helper in future.
