batman-adv: B.A.T.M.A.N. V - implement GW selection logic

Since the GW selection logic has been made routing protocol specific
it is now possible for B.A.T.M.A.N V to have its own mechanism by
providing the API implementation.

Implement the GW specific API in the B.A.T.M.A.N. V protocol in
order to provide a working GW selection mechanism.
