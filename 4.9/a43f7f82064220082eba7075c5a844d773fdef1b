Btrfs: remove BUG_ON in start_transaction

Since we could get errors from the concurrent aborted transaction,
the check of this BUG_ON in start_transaction is not true any more.

Say, while flushing free space cache inode's dirty pages,
btrfs_finish_ordered_io
 -> btrfs_join_transaction_nolock
      (the transaction has been aborted.)
      -> BUG_ON(type == TRANS_JOIN_NOLOCK);
