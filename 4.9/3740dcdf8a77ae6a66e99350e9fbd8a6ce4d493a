jiffies: add time comparison functions for 64 bit jiffies

Though the time_before and time_after family of functions were nicely
extended to support jiffies64, so that the interface would be consistent,
it was forgotten to also extend the before/after jiffies functions to
support jiffies64.  This commit brings the interface to parity between
jiffies and jiffies64, which is quite convenient.
