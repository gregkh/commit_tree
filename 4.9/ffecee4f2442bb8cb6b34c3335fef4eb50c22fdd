iov_iter: kernel-doc import_iovec() and rw_copy_check_uvector()

Both import_iovec() and rw_copy_check_uvector() take an array
(typically small and on-stack) which is used to hold an iovec array copy
from userspace. This is to avoid an expensive memory allocation in the
fast path (i.e. few iovec elements).

The caller may have to check whether these functions actually used
the provided buffer or allocated a new one -- but this differs between
the too. Let's just add a kernel doc to clarify what the semantics are
for each function.
