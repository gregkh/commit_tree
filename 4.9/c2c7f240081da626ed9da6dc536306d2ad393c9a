drm/i915: unify first-stage engine struct setup

intel_lrc.c has a table of "logical rings" (meaning engines), while
intel_ringbuffer.c has separately open-coded initialisation for each
engine. We can deduplicate this somewhat by using the same first-stage
engine-setup function for both modes.

So here we expose the function that transfers information from the
static table of (all) known engines to the dev_priv->engine array of
engines available on this device (adjusting the names along the way)
and then embed calls to it in both the LRC and the legacy-mode setup.
