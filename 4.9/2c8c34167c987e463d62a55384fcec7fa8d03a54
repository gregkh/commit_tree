mfd: lpss: Fix Intel Kaby Lake PCH-H properties

There are a few issues on Intel Kaby Lake PCH-H properties added by
commit a6a576b78e09 ("mfd: lpss: Add Intel Kaby Lake PCH-H PCI IDs"):

- Input clock of I2C controller on Intel Kaby Lake PCH-H is 120 MHz not
  133 MHz. This was probably copy-paste error from Intel Broxton I2C
  properties.
- There is no default I2C SDA hold time specified which is used when
  ACPI doesn't provide it. I got information from Windows driver team
  that Kaby Lake PCH-H can use the same configuration than Intel
  Sunrisepoint PCH.
- Common HS-UART properties are not used.

Fix these by reusing the Sunrisepoint properties on Kaby Lake PCH-H.
