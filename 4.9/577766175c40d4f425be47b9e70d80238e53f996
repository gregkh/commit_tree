regulator: core: don't return error with inadequate reason

drms_uA_update() always returns failure when it cannot find regulator's
input voltage.  But if hardware supports load configuration with
ops->set_load() and the input regulator isn't specified with valid reason
such as the input regulator is battery, not finding input voltage is
normal so such case should not return with an error.

Avoid such inadequate error return by checking input/output voltages
only when drms_uA_update() is about to configure load with enum based
ops->set_mode().
