scsi: qla2xxx: do not queue commands when unloading

When the driver is unloading, in qla2x00_remove_one(), there is a single
call/point in time to abort ongoing commands, qla2x00_abort_all_cmds(),
which is still several steps away from the call to scsi_remove_host().

If more commands continue to arrive and be processed during that
interval, when the driver is tearing down and releasing its structures,
it might potentially hit an oops due to invalid memory access:

    Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address 0x00000138
    <...>
    NIP [d000000004700a40] qla2xxx_queuecommand+0x80/0x3f0 [qla2xxx]
    LR [d000000004700a10] qla2xxx_queuecommand+0x50/0x3f0 [qla2xxx]

So, fail commands in qla2xxx_queuecommand() if the UNLOADING bit is set.
