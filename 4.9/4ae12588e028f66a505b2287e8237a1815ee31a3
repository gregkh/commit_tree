mmc: tegra: Mark 64-bit DMA broken on Tegra124

According to the TRM, the SD/MMC controller on Tegra124 supports 34-bit
addressing, but testing shows that this doesn't work. On a device which
has more than 2 GiB of RAM and LPAE enabled, buffer allocations can use
addresses above the 32-bit boundary.

One way to work around this would be to enable IOMMU physical to virtual
address translations for the SD/MMC controllers, but that's not easy to
implement without breaking existing use-cases. It's also not obvious why
34-bit addressing doesn't work as advertised. In order to fix this for
existing users, add the SDHCI_QUIRK2_BROKEN_64_BIT_DMA quirk for now.
