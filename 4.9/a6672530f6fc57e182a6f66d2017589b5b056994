staging: comedi: addi_apci_3501: remove timer/counter subdevice support

This driver is for a simple 4/8 channel analog output board with 2 isolated
digital inputs and 2 isolated digital outputs. Support for these subdevices
is provided by the driver.

The boards also has a watchdog timer that can be used to reset the analog
outputs. It can also be used as a general purpose 12-bit timer when the
watchdog function is not necessary. The current support code for this
subdevice is broken. It does not follow the comedi API and requires some
out-of-tree patches in order to even work.

Remove the subdevice support. If a proper register map can be located for
this board we can add support back later.
