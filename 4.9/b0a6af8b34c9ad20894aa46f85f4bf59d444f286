drm/nouveau/acpi: fix check for power resources support

Check whether the kernel really supports power resources for a device,
otherwise the power might not be removed when the device is runtime
suspended (DSM should still work in these cases where PR does not).

This is a workaround for a problem where ACPICA and Windows 10 differ in
behavior. ACPICA does not correctly enumerate power resources within a
conditional block (due to delayed execution of such blocks) and as a
result power_resources is set to false even if _PR3 exists.
