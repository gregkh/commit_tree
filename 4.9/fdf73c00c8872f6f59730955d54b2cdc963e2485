greybus: camera: Add wrapper for sync operation with flags

The greybus operation core synchronous operation call doesn't support
operation flags. Create a new synchronous operation wrapper with flags,
and modify the capabilities operation implementation to use it.

The code could be later moved to the greybus core if other drivers have
a similar need.
