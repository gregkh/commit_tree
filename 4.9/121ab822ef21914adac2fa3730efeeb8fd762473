security,overlayfs: Provide security hook for copy up of xattrs for overlay file

Provide a security hook which is called when xattrs of a file are being
copied up. This hook is called once for each xattr and LSM can return
0 if the security module wants the xattr to be copied up, 1 if the
security module wants the xattr to be discarded on the copy, -EOPNOTSUPP
if the security module does not handle/manage the xattr, or a -errno
upon an error.
