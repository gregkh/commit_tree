drm/i915: Call intel_fbc_pre_update() after pinning the new pageflip

intel_fbc_pre_update() depends upon the new state being already pinned
in place in the Global GTT (primarily for both fencing which wants both
an offset and a fence register, if assigned). This requires the call to
intel_fbc_pre_update() be after intel_pin_and_fence_fb() - but commit
e8216e502aca ("drm/i915/fbc: call intel_fbc_pre_update earlier during
page flips") moved the code way too much up in its attempt to call it
before the page flip.

v2 (from Paulo):
 - Point the original bad commit.
 - Add a comment to maybe prevent further regressions.
