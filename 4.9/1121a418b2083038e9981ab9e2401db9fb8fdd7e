video: ARM CLCD: fix endpoint lookup logic

The addition of the Nomadik support in this driver introduced
a bug in clcdfb_of_init_display(), which now calls init_panel
with an uninitialized 'endpoint' pointer, as "gcc -Wmaybe-uninitialized"
warns:

drivers/video/fbdev/amba-clcd.c: In function 'clcdfb_of_init_display':
drivers/video/fbdev/amba-clcd.c:785:5: error: 'endpoint' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This reverts the broken part of the function to what it was before
the patch, which is the best guess I have to what it should be.
I assume this was left over from an attempted rework of the
code that was partially backed out.
