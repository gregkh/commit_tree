ARM: dts: exynos: Fix mismatched value for SD4 pull up/down configuration on exynos4210

The pinctrl pull up/down register on exynos4210 is 2-bit wide for each
pin and it accepts only values of 0, 1 and 3.  The pins sd4-bus-width8
were configured with value of 4.  The driver does not validate the value
so this overflow effectively set a bit 1 in adjacent pins thus
configuring them to pull down.

The author's intention was probably to set drive strength of 4x.  All
other bus-widths pins are configured with pull up and drive strength of
4x.  Fix this one with same pattern.
