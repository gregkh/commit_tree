mwifiex: printk() overflow with 32-byte SSIDs

SSIDs aren't guaranteed to be 0-terminated. Let's cap the max length
when we print them out.

This can be easily noticed by connecting to a network with a 32-octet
SSID:

[ 3903.502925] mwifiex_pcie 0000:01:00.0: info: trying to associate to
'0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef <uninitialized mem>' bssid
