sc16is7xx: make sure device is in suspend once probed

  Previously sc16is7xx_power was called in order to set the device to a
  low power mode.

  However since SC16IS7XX_EFR_ENABLE_BIT was not set beforehand this
  suspend request had not effect.

  Also, soft-reset the device prior to port initialization. It may
  otherwise be in a state (interrupt pending, fifo not empty) which
  prevents it from sleeping.
