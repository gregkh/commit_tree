mremap: move_ptes: check pte dirty after its removal

Linus found there still is a race in mremap after commit 5d1904204c99
("mremap: fix race between mremap() and page cleanning").

As described by Linus:
 "the issue is that another thread might make the pte be dirty (in the
  hardware walker, so no locking of ours will make any difference)
  *after* we checked whether it was dirty, but *before* we removed it
  from the page tables"

Fix it by moving the check after we removed it from the page table.
