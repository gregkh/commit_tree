vme: make core vme support explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/vme/Kconfig:menuconfig VME_BUS
drivers/vme/Kconfig:    bool "VME bridge support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We replace module.h and moduleparam.h (unused) with init.h and also
export.h ; the latter since this file does export some syms.

Since this is a struct bus_type and not a platform_driver, we don't
have any ".suppress_bind_attrs" to be concerned about when we
drop the ".remove" code from this file.

Since module_init was not in use by this code, the init ordering
remains unchanged with this commit.
