ASoC: da7219: Reset codec gracefully, if still active

Currently the reset code in i2c_probe only resets the AAD part of
the device and not the entire codec. This patch updates the driver
to resolve this and ensures that if the codec is still active from
a previous boot then the audio paths are powered down prior to
reset.
