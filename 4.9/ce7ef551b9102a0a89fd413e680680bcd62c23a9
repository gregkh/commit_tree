HID: Remove broken links to tablet descriptions

Remove comments with broken links to tablet descriptions from
hid-kye/uclogic/waltop drivers.

They pointed to now dead DIGImend project wiki at sf.net. Even though
the DIGImend project still hosts descriptions, now at
digimend.github.io, it's better to avoid them going stale again, and let
anyone interested search the web instead.
