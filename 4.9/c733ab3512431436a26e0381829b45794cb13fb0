scsi: qla2xxx: do not abort all commands in the adapter during EEH recovery

The previous commit 1535aa75a3d8 ("qla2xxx: fix invalid DMA access after
command aborts in PCI device remove") introduced a regression during an
EEH recovery, since the change to the qla2x00_abort_all_cmds() function
calls qla2xxx_eh_abort(), which verifies the EEH recovery condition but
handles it heavy-handed. (commit a465537ad1a4 "qla2xxx: Disable the
adapter and skip error recovery in case of register disconnect.")

This problem warrants a more general/optimistic solution right into
qla2xxx_eh_abort() (eg in case a real command abort arrives during EEH
recovery, or if it takes long enough to trigger command aborts); but
it's still worth to add a check to ensure the code added by the previous
commit is correct and contained within its owner function.

This commit just adds a 'if (!ha->flags.eeh_busy)' check around it.
(ahem; a trivial fix for this -rc series; sorry for this oversight.)

With it applied, both PCI device remove and EEH recovery works fine.
