NFSD: fix corruption in notifier registration

By design notifier can be registered once only, however nfsd registers
the same inetaddr notifiers per net-namespace.  When this happen it
corrupts list of notifiers, as result some notifiers can be not called
on proper event, traverse on list can be cycled forever, and second
unregister can access already freed memory.
