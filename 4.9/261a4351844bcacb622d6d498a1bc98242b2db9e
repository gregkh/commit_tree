IB/qib,IB/hfi: Use core common header file

Use common header file structs, defines, and accessors
in the drivers.  The old declarations are removed.

The repositioning of the includes allows for the removal
of hfi1_message_header and replaces its use with ib_header.

Also corrected are two issues with set_armed_to_active():
- The "packet" parameter is now a pointer as it should have been
- The etype is validated to insure that the header is correct
