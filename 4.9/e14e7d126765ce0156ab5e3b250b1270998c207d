crypto: ccp - Enable use of the additional CCP

A second CCP is available, identical to the first, with
its ownn PCI ID. Make it available for use by the crypto
subsystem, as well as for DMA activity and random
number generation.

This device is not pre-configured at at boot time. The
driver must configure it (during the probe) for use.
