pwm: sti: Add PWM capture callback

Once a PWM capture has been initiated, the capture call enables a rising
edge detection interrupt, then waits. Once each of the 3 phase changes
have been recorded the thread then wakes. The remaining part of the call
carries out the relevant calculations and returns a structure filled out
with the capture data.
