fbdev/efifb: Fix 16 color palette entry calculation

When using efifb with a 16-bit (5:6:5) visual, fbcon's text is rendered
in the wrong colors - e.g. text gray (#aaaaaa) is rendered as green
(#50bc50) and neighboring pixels have slightly different values
(such as #50bc78).

The reason is that fbcon loads its 16 color palette through
efifb_setcolreg(), which in turn calculates a 32-bit value to write
into memory for each palette index.
Until now, this code could only handle 8-bit visuals and didn't mask
overlapping values when ORing them.

With this patch, fbcon displays the correct colors when a qemu VM is
booted in 16-bit mode (in GRUB: "set gfxpayload=800x600x16").
