xfs: Propagate dentry down to inode_change_ok()

To avoid clearing of capabilities or security related extended
attributes too early, inode_change_ok() will need to take dentry instead
of inode. Propagate dentry down to functions calling inode_change_ok().
This is rather straightforward except for xfs_set_mode() function which
does not have dentry easily available. Luckily that function does not
call inode_change_ok() anyway so we just have to do a little dance with
function prototypes.
