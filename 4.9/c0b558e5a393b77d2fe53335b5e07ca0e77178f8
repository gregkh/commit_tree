hv_netvsc: Implement batching of receive completions

The existing code uses busy retry when unable to send out receive
completions due to full ring buffer. It also gives up retrying after limit
is reached, and causes receive buffer slots not being recycled.
This patch implements batching of receive completions. It also prevents
dropping receive completions due to full ring buffer.
