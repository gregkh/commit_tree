tty: amba-pl011: define flag register bits for ZTE device

For some reason we do not really understand, ZTE hardware designers
choose to define PL011 Flag Register bit positions differently from
standard ones as below.

	Bit		Standard	ZTE
	-----------------------------------
	CTS		0		1
	DSR		1		3
	BUSY		3		8
	RI		8		0

Let's define these bits into vendor data and get ZTE PL011 supported
properly.
