cfg80211: add checks for beacon rate, extend to mesh

The previous commit added support for specifying the beacon rate
for AP mode. Add features checks to this, and extend it to also
support the rate configuration for mesh networks. For IBSS it's
not as simple due to joining etc., so that's not yet supported.
