staging: rts5208/ms.c: add missing releases in mg_get_local_EKB and mg_get_ICV

mg_get_local_EKB and mg_get_ICV used to return with an error code before
releasing all resources. This patch add a jump to the appropriate label
ensuring that the resources are properly released before returning.

This issue was found with Hector.
