coresight: fix handling of ETM trace register access via sysfs

The ETM registers are classified into 2 categories: trace and management.
The core power domain contains most of the trace unit logic including
all(except TRCOSLAR and TRCOSLSR) the trace registers. The debug power
domain contains the external debugger interface including all management
registers.

This patch adds coresight unit specific function coresight_simple_func
which can be used for ETM trace registers by providing a ETM specific
read function which does smp cross call to ensure the trace core is
powered up before the register is accessed.
