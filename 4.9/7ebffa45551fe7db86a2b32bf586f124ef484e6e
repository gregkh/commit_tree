mm,oom_reaper: reduce find_lock_task_mm() usage

Patch series "fortify oom killer even more", v2.

This patch (of 9):

__oom_reap_task() can be simplified a bit if it receives a valid mm from
oom_reap_task() which also uses that mm when __oom_reap_task() failed.
We can drop one find_lock_task_mm() call and also make the
__oom_reap_task() code flow easier to follow.  Moreover, this will make
later patch in the series easier to review.  Pinning mm's mm_count for
longer time is not really harmful because this will not pin much memory.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional change.
