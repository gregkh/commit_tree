ARCv2: Implement atomic64 based on LLOCKD/SCONDD instructions

ARCv2 ISA provides 64-bit exclusive load/stores so use them to implement
the 64-bit atomics and elide the spinlock based generic 64-bit atomics

boot tested with atomic64 self-test (and GOD bless the person who wrote
them, I realized my inline assmebly is sloppy as hell)
