scsi: hpsa: use bus '3' for legacy HBA devices

Older controllers use SCSI target id '0' for the first internal disk. As
the controllers are now placed on the same bus as the internal disks
this leads to a clash with the SCSI target id of controller.  This patch
checks the SCSI revision, and moves older controller to bus '3' to be
compatible with older releases and avoid this problem.
