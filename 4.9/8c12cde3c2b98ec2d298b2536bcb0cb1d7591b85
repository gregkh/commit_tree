greybus: define greybus interface abstraction

Define new source files "interface.h" and "interface.c" to contain
the definitions of the Greybus interface abstraction.  A Greybus
interface represents a UniPro device present in a UniPro module.
For Project Ara, each interface block on a module implements a
UniPro interface.
