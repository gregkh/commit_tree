pmem: report error on clear poison failure

ACPI Clear Uncorrectable Error DSM function may fail or may be
unsupported on a platform.  pmem_clear_poison() returns without clearing
badblocks in such cases.  This failure is detected at the next read
(-EIO).

This behavior can lead to an issue when user keeps writing but does not
read immediately.  For instance, flight recorder file may be only read
when it is necessary for troubleshooting.

Change pmem_do_bvec() and pmem_clear_poison() to return -EIO so that
filesystem can log an error message on a write error.
