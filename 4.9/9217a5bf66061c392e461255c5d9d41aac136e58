dmaengine: dw: keep copy of custom slave config in dwc

It seems we need to extend custom slave configuration by one more member to
support Intel Quart UART. It becomes a burden to manage all members of struct
dw_dma_slave one-by-one.

Replace the set of fields by embedding struct dw_dma_slave into struct
dw_dma_chan.
