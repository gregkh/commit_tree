btrfs: fix btrfs_no_printk stub helper

The addition of btrfs_no_printk() caused a build failure when
CONFIG_PRINTK is disabled:

fs/btrfs/send.c: In function 'send_rename':
fs/btrfs/ctree.h:3367:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'btrfs_no_printk' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

This moves the helper outside of that #ifdef so it is always
defined, and changes the existing #ifdef to refer to that
helper as well for consistency.

Fixes: 47c57058ff2c ("btrfs: btrfs_debug should consume fs_info when DEBUG is not defined")
