powerpc: Set missing wakeup bit in LPCR on POWER9

There is a new bit, LPCR_PECE_HVEE (Hypervisor Virtualization Exit
Enable), which controls wakeup from STOP states on Hypervisor
Virtualization Interrupts (which happen to also be all external
interrupts in host or bare metal mode).

It needs to be set or we will miss wakeups.
