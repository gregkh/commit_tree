greybus: audio: Add direct audio streaming control for APBridgeA

The latest audio architecture does not stream audio data over the
USB link between the AP and APBridgeA.  Instead, audio data is
streamed directly over the I2S link between the two.

To support the Greybus audio driver in setting up the I2S port and
controling packeting/depacketizing of audio data to/from Greybus
audio messages, define a set of commands and their parameters.
These commands and parameters will be placed into a request and sent
over the USB control channel to APBridgeA.  A corresponding driver
on APBridgeA will receive and process the requests.
