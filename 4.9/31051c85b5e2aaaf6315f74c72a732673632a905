fs: Give dentry to inode_change_ok() instead of inode

inode_change_ok() will be resposible for clearing capabilities and IMA
extended attributes and as such will need dentry. Give it as an argument
to inode_change_ok() instead of an inode. Also rename inode_change_ok()
to setattr_prepare() to better relect that it does also some
modifications in addition to checks.
