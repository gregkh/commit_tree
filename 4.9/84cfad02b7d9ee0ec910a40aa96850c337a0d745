greybus: loopback: add bitmask of connections to include in test

Feature add which enables the ability to select a bit-mask of connections
to run when executing a loopback test set. This is a feature add to
facilitate testing on the firmware side minus the necessity to recompile
firmware to support unicast (v) multicast (v) bitmask.
