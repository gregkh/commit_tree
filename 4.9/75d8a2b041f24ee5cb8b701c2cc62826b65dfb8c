mfd: arizona: Add sensible return value to some error paths

There are some cases in arizona_dev_init, such as where we don't
recognise the chip ID, in which we head to the error path without
setting a sensible error code in ret. This would lead to the chip
silently failing probe, as it would still return 0. Fix this up by
adding appropriate sets of the return value.

Whilst adding these update the existing paths that do return an error
when the chip is not recognised to use ENODEV, which seems like a better
fit.
