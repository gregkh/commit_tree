serial: xuartps: Add some register initialisation to cdns_early_console_setup()

Add initialisation of control register and baud rate to
cdns_early_console_setup(), required when running kernel standalone
without a boot loader. Baud rate is only initialised when specified in
earlycon command-line option, otherwise it is assumed this has been
set by a boot loader. Updated Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
accordingly.
