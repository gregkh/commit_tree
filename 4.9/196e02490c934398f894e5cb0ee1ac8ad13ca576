Btrfs: remove unnecessary btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty in split_leaf

When we're not able to get enough space through splitting leaf,
we'd create a new sibling leaf instead, and it's possible that we return
 a zero-nritem sibling leaf and mark it dirty before it's in a consistent
state.  With CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY=y, the integrity check of
check_leaf will report panic due to this zero-nritem non-root leaf.

This removes the unnecessary btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty.
