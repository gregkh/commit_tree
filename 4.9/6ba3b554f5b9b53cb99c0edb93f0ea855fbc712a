arm64: use alternative auto-nop

Make use of the new alternative_if and alternative_else_nop_endif and
get rid of our homebew NOP sleds, making the code simpler to read.

Note that for cpu_do_switch_mm the ret has been moved out of the
alternative sequence, and in the default case there will be three
additional NOPs executed.
