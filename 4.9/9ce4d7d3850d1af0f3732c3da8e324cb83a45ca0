fs/afs/vlocation: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

The workqueue "afs_vlocation_update_worker" queues a single work item
&afs_vlocation_update and hence it doesn't require execution ordering.
Hence, alloc_workqueue has been used to replace the deprecated
create_singlethread_workqueue instance.

Since the workqueue is being used on a memory reclaim path, WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
flag has been set to ensure forward progress under memory pressure.

Since there are fixed number of work items, explicit concurrency
limit is unnecessary here.
