mtd: nand: Fix data interface configuration logic

When changing from one data interface setting to another, one has to
ensure a specific sequence which is described in the ONFI spec.

One of these constraints is that the CE line has go high after a reset
before a command can be sent with the new data interface setting, which
is not guaranteed by the current implementation.

Rework the nand_reset() function and all the call sites to make sure the
CE line is asserted and released when required.

Also make sure to actually apply the new data interface setting on the
first die.
