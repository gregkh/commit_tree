rtc: omap: Support ext_wakeup configuration

Support configuration of ext_wakeup sources. This patch makes it
possible to enable ext_wakeup and set it's polarity, depending on board
configuration. AM335x's dedicated PMIC (tps65217) uses ext_wakeup to
notify about power-button presses. Handling power-button presses enables
to recover from RTC-only power states correctly.
