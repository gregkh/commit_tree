wl3501_cs: Add spinlock to wl3501_reset

Likely wl3501_reset should acquire spinlock as wl3501_{open, close}.
One of calls of wl3501_reset has been already protected.
The others were unprotected and might lead to a race condition.
The patch adds spinlock into the wl3501_reset and removes it from
wl3501_tx_timeout.
