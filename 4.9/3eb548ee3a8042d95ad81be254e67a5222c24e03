Btrfs: memset to avoid stale content in btree node block

During updating btree, we could push items between sibling
nodes/leaves, for leaves data sections starts reversely from
the end of the block while for nodes we only have key pairs
which are stored one by one from the start of the block.

So we could do try to push key pairs from one node to the next
node right in the tree, and after that, we update the node's
nritems to reflect the correct end while leaving the stale
content in the node.  One may intentionally corrupt the fs
image and access the stale content by bumping the nritems and
causes various crashes.

This takes the in-memory @nritems as the correct one and
gets to memset the unused part of a btree node.
