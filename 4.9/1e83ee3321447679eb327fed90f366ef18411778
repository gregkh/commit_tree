greybus: arche-platform: assert wake-detect to complete WAKE_OUT event

After SVC generates WAKE_OUT (pulling wake-detect pin low) and APB is
brought out of reset, we need to assert wake-detect again to complete
SVC WAKE_OUT logic.

Testing Done:
- Used for DB3.5/EVT1.5 hardware during bringup
- Regression tested on DB3.1+ES2, DB3.1+ES3
