netfilter: xt_NFLOG: fix unexpected truncated packet

Justin and Chris spotted that iptables NFLOG target was broken when they
upgraded the kernel to 4.8: "ulogd-2.0.5- IPs are no longer logged" or
"results in segfaults in ulogd-2.0.5".

Because "struct nf_loginfo li;" is a local variable, and flags will be
filled with garbage value, not inited to zero. So if it contains 0x1,
packets will not be logged to the userspace anymore.
