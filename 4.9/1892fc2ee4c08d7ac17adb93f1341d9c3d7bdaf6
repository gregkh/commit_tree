mei: stop the stall timer worker if not needed

The stall timer worker checks periodically if there is a stalled i/o
transaction. The issue with the current implementation is that the timer
is ticking also when there is no pending i/o transaction.
This patch provides a simple change that prevents rescheduling
of the delayed work when there is no pending i/o.
