rcuperf: Consistently insert space between flag and message

A few rcuperf dmesg output messages have no space between the flag and
the start of the message. In contrast, every other messages consistently
supplies a single space.  This difference makes rcuperf dmesg output
hard to read and to mechanically parse.  This commit therefore fixes
this problem by modifying a pr_alert() call and PERFOUT_STRING() macro
function to provide that single space.
