ACPI / EC: Enable event freeze mode to improve event handling for suspend process

This patch enables the event freeze mode, flushing the EC event handling in
.suspend() callback. This feature is experimental, if it is bisected out to
be the cause of the real issues, please report the issues to the kernel
bugzilla for further root causing and improvement.

This mode eliminates useless _Qxx handling during the power saving
operations, thus can help to tune the power saving operations faster. Tests
show that this mode can efficiently block flooding _Qxx during the suspend
process and tune the speed of the suspend faster.
