SUNRPC: rpc_clnt_add_xprt setup function for NFS layer

Use a setup function to call into the NFS layer to test an rpc_xprt
for session trunking so as to not leak the rpc_xprt_switch into
the nfs layer.

Search for the address in the rpc_xprt_switch first so as not to
put an unnecessary EXCHANGE_ID on the wire.
