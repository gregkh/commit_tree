autofs:  Fix automounts by using current_real_cred()->uid

Seth Forshee reports that in 4.8-rcN some automounts are failing
because the requesting the automount changed.

The relevant call path is:
follow_automount()
    ->d_automount
    autofs4_d_automount
       autofs4_mount_wait
           autofs4_wait

In autofs4_wait wq_uid and wq_gid are set to current_uid() and
current_gid respectively.  With follow_automount now overriding creds
uid that we export to userspace changes and that breaks existing
setups.

To remove the regression set wq_uid and wq_gid from
current_real_cred()->uid and current_real_cred()->gid respectively.
This restores the current behavior as current->real_cred is identical
to current->cred except when override creds are used.
