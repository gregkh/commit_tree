drm/panel: simple-panel: Add delay timings for Starry KR122EA0SRA

Taking our cue from commit a42f6e3f8f03 ("drm/panel: simple: Add delay
timing for Sharp LQ123P1JX31"), let's add timings:

 .prepare = t1 + t3
 .enable = t7
 .unprepare = t11 + 12

Without this, the panel may not be given enough time to come up.
