powerpc: signals: Stop using current in signal code

Much of the signal code takes a pt_regs on which it operates. Over
time the signal code has needed to know more about the thread than
what pt_regs can supply, this information is obtained as needed by
using 'current'.

This approach is not strictly incorrect however it does mean that
there is now a hard requirement that the pt_regs being passed around
does belong to current, this is never checked. A safer approach is for
the majority of the signal functions to take a task_struct from which
they can obtain pt_regs and any other information they need. The
caveat that the task_struct they are passed must be current doesn't go
away but can more easily be checked for.

Functions called from outside powerpc signal code are passed a pt_regs
and they can confirm that the pt_regs is that of current and pass
current to other functions, furthurmore, powerpc signal functions can
check that the task_struct they are passed is the same as current
avoiding possible corruption of current (or the task they are passed)
if this assertion ever fails.
