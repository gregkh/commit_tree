ARM: 8597/1: VDSO: put RO and RO after init objects into proper sections

vdso_data_mapping is never modified, so mark it as const.

vdso_total_pages, vdso_data_page, vdso_text_mapping and cntvct_ok are
initialized by vdso_init(), thereafter are read only.

The fact that they are read only after init makes them candidates for
__ro_after_init declarations.
