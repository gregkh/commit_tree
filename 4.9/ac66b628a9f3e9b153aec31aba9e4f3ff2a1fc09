staging: rtl8188eu: remove rtw_proc_{init,remove}_one

rtw_proc_init_one() and rtw_proc_remove_one() are two very long
functions that are supposed to create a bunch of proc entries to
access debugging features of the driver.

But both of them are under #if 0 since their first commit three years
ago (5adef66acf73705ae95ea0b1e6b5fc7f17d82d30), replaced by two empty
functions.

Should they be moved out of #if 0 thay would not even compile, as they
used functions that have been removed years ago
(create_proc_read_entry()) and they use variables that are not defined
(e.g. rtw_proc_cnt).

rtw_proc_init_one() mentions several other functions that are not
mentioned anywhere else in the kernel tree. Thus, after the present
patch, all of those other functions can be cleanly removed as well, as
they will be not mentioned anymore, not even in disabled code.

Subsequent commits remove those other functions.

Should anybody want to implement (in a proper way) the mentioned
debugging features, they can still fetch this code from the git
history.
