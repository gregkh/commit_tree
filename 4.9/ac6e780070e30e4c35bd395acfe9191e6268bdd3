tcp: take care of truncations done by sk_filter()

With syzkaller help, Marco Grassi found a bug in TCP stack,
crashing in tcp_collapse()

Root cause is that sk_filter() can truncate the incoming skb,
but TCP stack was not really expecting this to happen.
It probably was expecting a simple DROP or ACCEPT behavior.

We first need to make sure no part of TCP header could be removed.
Then we need to adjust TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->end_seq

Many thanks to syzkaller team and Marco for giving us a reproducer.
