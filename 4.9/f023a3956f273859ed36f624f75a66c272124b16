config: android: move device mapper options to recommended

CONFIG_MD is in recommended, but other dependent options like DM_CRYPT and
DM_VERITY options are in base.  The result is the options in base don't
get enabled when applying both base and recommended fragments.  Move all
the options to recommended.
