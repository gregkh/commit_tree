dax: use correct dev_t value

The dev_t variable in devm_create_dax_dev() is used before it's
first set:

drivers/dax/dax.c: In function 'devm_create_dax_dev':
drivers/dax/dax.c:205:39: error: 'dev_t' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
  inode = iget5_locked(dax_superblock, hash_32(devt + DAXFS_MAGIC, 31),
                                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/dax/dax.c:688:8: note: 'dev_t' was declared here

This reorders the code to how it looks correct to me.
