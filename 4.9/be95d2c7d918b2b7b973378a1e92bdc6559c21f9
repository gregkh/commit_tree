clk: samsung: Add support for EPLL on exynos5410

This patch adds code instantiating the EPLL, which is used as the
audio subsystem's root clock.
The requirement to specify the external root clock in clocks property
is documented.  Having the consumer 'clocks' property ensures proper
initialization order by explicitly specifying dependencies in DT.
It prevents situations when the SoC's clock controller driver has
initialized, the external oscillator clock is not yet registered
and setting clock frequencies through assigned-clock-rates property
doesn't work properly due to unknown external oscillator frequency.
