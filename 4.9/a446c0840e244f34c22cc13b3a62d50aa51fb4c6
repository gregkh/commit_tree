nvme.h: resync with nvme-cli

Import a few updates to nvme.h from nvme-cli.  This mostly includes a few
new fields and error codes, but also a few renames that so far are only
used in user space.  Also one field is moved from an array of two le64
values to one of 16 u8 values so that we can more easily access it.
