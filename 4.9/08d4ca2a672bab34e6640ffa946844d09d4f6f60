iommu/arm-smmu: Support non-PCI devices with SMMUv3

With the device <-> stream ID relationship suitably abstracted and
of_xlate() hooked up, the PCI dependency now looks, and is, entirely
arbitrary. Any bus using the of_dma_configure() mechanism will work,
so extend support to the platform and AMBA buses which do just that.
