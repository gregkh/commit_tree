ARM: dts: Configure omap5 OTG ID pin

The ID pin GPIO comes from the PMIC. Let's configure it as a GPIO
for the driver to use, and also make sure the PMIC GPIO pin muxing
is correct. The PMIC pad1 and 2 values for omap5-uevm and igepv5 are
0x5a and 0x1b, we only need to clear bit 2 in pad1 register to make
the ID pin GPIO work.
