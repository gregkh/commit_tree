platform driver: fix use-after-free in platform_device_del()

In platform_device_del(), the device is still used after a call to
device_del(). At this point there is no guarantee that the device is
still there and there could be a use-after-free access. Move the
call to device_remove_properties() before device_del() to fix that.
