Btrfs: remove BUG() in raid56

This BUG() has been triggered by a fuzz testing image, which contains
an invalid chunk type, ie. a single stripe chunk has the raid6 type.

Btrfs can handle this gracefully by returning -EIO, so besides using
btrfs_warn to give us more debugging information rather than a single
BUG(), we can return error properly.
