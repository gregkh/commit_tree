PCI: Add Precision Time Measurement (PTM) support

Add Precision Time Measurement (PTM) support (see PCIe r3.1, sec 6.22).

Enable PTM on PTM Root devices and switch ports.  This does not enable PTM
on endpoints.

There currently are no PTM-capable devices on the market, but it is
expected to be supported by the Intel Apollo Lake platform.
