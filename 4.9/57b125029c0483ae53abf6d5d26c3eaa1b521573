batman-adv: iv_ogm, Reduce code duplication

The difference between tq1 and tq2 are calculated the same way in two
separate functions.

This patch moves the common code to a separate function
'batadv_iv_ogm_neigh_diff' which handles everything necessary. The other
two functions can then handle errors and use the difference directly.
