fscrypto: make filename crypto functions return 0 on success

Several filename crypto functions: fname_decrypt(),
fscrypt_fname_disk_to_usr(), and fscrypt_fname_usr_to_disk(), returned
the output length on success or -errno on failure.  However, the output
length was redundant with the value written to 'oname->len'.  It is also
potentially error-prone to make callers have to check for '< 0' instead
of '!= 0'.

Therefore, make these functions return 0 instead of a length, and make
the callers who cared about the return value being a length use
'oname->len' instead.  For consistency also make other callers check for
a nonzero result rather than a negative result.

This change also fixes the inconsistency of fname_encrypt() actually
already returning 0 on success, not a length like the other filename
crypto functions and as documented in its function comment.
