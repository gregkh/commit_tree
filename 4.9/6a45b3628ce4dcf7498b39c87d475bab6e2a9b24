ovl: Fix info leak in ovl_lookup_temp()

The function uses the memory address of a struct dentry as unique id.
While the address-based directory entry is only visible to root it is IMHO
still worth fixing since the temporary name does not have to be a kernel
address.  It can be any unique number.  Replace it by an atomic integer
which is allowed to wrap around.
