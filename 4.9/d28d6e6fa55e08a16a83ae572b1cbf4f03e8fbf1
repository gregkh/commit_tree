drm: modify drm_global_item_ref to avoid two times of writing ref->object

In previous drm_global_item_ref, there are two times of writing
ref->object if item->refcount is 0. So this patch does a minor update
to put alloc and init ref firstly, and then to modify the item of glob
array. Use "else" to avoid two times of writing ref->object. It can
make the code logic more clearly.
