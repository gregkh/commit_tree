staging: lustre: o2iblnd: Put back work queue check previously removed

The previous patch, http://review.whamcloud.com/21304/, removed
a check needed until LU-5718 is properly addressed.  With
the check, LU-5718 results in an error message and a lost
RDMA operation.  Without it, we have memory corruption and
a crash (much harder to debug).

Putting the check back in case LU-5718 is not fixed soon.
