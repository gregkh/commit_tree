dmaengine: hsu: refactor hsu_dma_do_irq() to return int

Since we have nice macro IRQ_RETVAL() we would use it to convert a flag of
handled interrupt from int to irqreturn_t.

The rationale of doing this is:
a) hence we implicitly mark hsu_dma_do_irq() as an auxiliary function that
   can't be used as interrupt handler directly, and
b) to be in align with serial driver which is using serial8250_handle_irq()
   that returns plain int by design.
