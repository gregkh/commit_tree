greybus: svc: add flags and traffic class parameter to connection create op

The AP needs to be able to specify L4 CPort flags and traffic class
parameters on a connection-by-connection basis. Extend the connection
create operation to accept these. Since there's no policy to decide
these, fix them at TC0 with end-to-end-flow control, controlled segment
dropping, and CPort safety valve enabled.
