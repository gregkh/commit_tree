rxrpc: Add re-sent Tx annotation

Add a Tx-phase annotation for packet buffers to indicate that a buffer has
already been retransmitted.  This will be used by future congestion
management.  Re-retransmissions of a packet don't affect the congestion
window managment in the same way as initial retransmissions.
