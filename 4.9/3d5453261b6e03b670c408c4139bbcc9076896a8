greybus: pass appropriate type to create function

Based on a patch from Alex Elder <elder@linaro.org>.

Alex's original description:

Every descriptor in a manifest is interpreted by greybus_new_module().
We call a function to do initialization based on descriptor's type.

Since we know the type of the descriptor at that point, we can pass
to the called function the actual sub-type it needs (i.e., the union
member associated with the type).  This allows those functions to
be slightly simplified, and more focused.

Also change some size variables to have size_t type, and simplify a
few spots further by using sizeof(object) in place of sizeof(type).
