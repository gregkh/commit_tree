i2c: rk3x: Give the tuning value 0 during rk3x_i2c_v0_calc_timings

We found a bug that i2c transfer sometimes failed on 3066a board with
stabel-4.8, the con register would be updated by uninitialized tuning
value, it made the i2c transfer failed.

So give the tuning value to be zero during rk3x_i2c_v0_calc_timings.
