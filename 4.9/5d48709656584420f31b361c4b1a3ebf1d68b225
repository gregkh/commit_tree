rpcrdma: RDMA/CM private message data structure

Introduce data structure used by both client and server to exchange
implementation details during RDMA/CM connection establishment.

This is an experimental out-of-band exchange between Linux
RPC-over-RDMA Version One implementations, replacing the deprecated
CCP (see RFC 5666bis). The purpose of this extension is to enable
prototyping of features that might be introduced in a subsequent
version of RPC-over-RDMA.

Suggested by Christoph Hellwig and Devesh Sharma.
