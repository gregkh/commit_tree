powerpc/64s: Fix power4_fixup_nap placement

power4_fixup_nap is called from the "common" handlers, not the virt/real
handlers, therefore it should itself be a common handler. Placing it
down in the trampoline space caused it to go out of reach of its
callers, requiring a trampoline inserted at the start of the text
section, which breaks the fixed section address calculations.
