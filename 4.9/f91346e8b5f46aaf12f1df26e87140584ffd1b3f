mmc: mxs: Initialize the spinlock prior to using it

An interrupt may occur right after devm_request_irq() is called and
prior to the spinlock initialization, leading to a kernel oops,
as the interrupt handler uses the spinlock.

In order to prevent this problem, move the spinlock initialization
prior to requesting the interrupts.
