Revert "usb: dwc2: gadget: change variable name to more meaningful"

This reverts commit ba48eab8866c ("usb: dwc2: gadget: change variable
name to more meaningful").

This is needed to cleanly revert commit aa381a7259c3 ("usb: dwc2:
gadget: fix TX FIFO size and address initialization") which may cause
regressions on some platforms.
