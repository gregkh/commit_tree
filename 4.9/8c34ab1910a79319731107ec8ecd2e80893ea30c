cpufreq / sched: SCHED_CPUFREQ_IOWAIT flag to indicate iowait condition

Testing indicates that it is possible to improve performace
significantly without increasing energy consumption too much by
teaching cpufreq governors to bump up the CPU performance level if
the in_iowait flag is set for the task in enqueue_task_fair().

For this purpose, define a new cpufreq_update_util() flag
SCHED_CPUFREQ_IOWAIT and modify enqueue_task_fair() to pass that
flag to cpufreq_update_util() in the in_iowait case.  That generally
requires cpufreq_update_util() to be called directly from there,
because update_load_avg() may not be invoked in that case.
