ARM: 8610/1: V7M: Add dsb before jumping in handler mode

According to ARM AN321 (section 4.12):

"If the vector table is in writable memory such as SRAM, either relocated
by VTOR or a device dependent memory remapping mechanism, then
architecturally a memory barrier instruction is required after the vector
table entry is updated, and if the exception is to be activated
immediately"
