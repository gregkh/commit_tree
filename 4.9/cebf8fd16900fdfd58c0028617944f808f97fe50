driver core: fix race between creating/querying glue dir and its cleanup

The global mutex of 'gdp_mutex' is used to serialize creating/querying
glue dir and its cleanup. Turns out it isn't a perfect way because
part(kobj_kset_leave()) of the actual cleanup action() is done inside
the release handler of the glue dir kobject. That means gdp_mutex has
to be held before releasing the last reference count of the glue dir
kobject.

This patch moves glue dir's cleanup after kobject_del() in device_del()
for avoiding the race.
