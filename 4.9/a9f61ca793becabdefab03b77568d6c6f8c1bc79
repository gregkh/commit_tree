Drivers: hv: avoid vfree() on crash

When we crash from NMI context (e.g. after NMI injection from host when
'sysctl -w kernel.unknown_nmi_panic=1' is set) we hit

    kernel BUG at mm/vmalloc.c:1530!

as vfree() is denied. While the issue could be solved with in_nmi() check
instead I opted for skipping vfree on all sorts of crashes to reduce the
amount of work which can cause consequent crashes. We don't really need to
free anything on crash.
