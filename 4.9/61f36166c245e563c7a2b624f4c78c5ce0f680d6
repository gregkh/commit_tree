Revert "target: Fix residual overflow handling in target_complete_cmd_with_length"

This reverts commit c1ccbfe0311e2380a6d2dcb0714b36904f5d586f.

Reverting this patch, as it incorrectly assumes the additional length
for INQUIRY in target_complete_cmd_with_length() is SCSI allocation
length, which breaks existing user-space code when SCSI allocation
length is smaller than additional length.

  root@scsi-mq:~# sg_inq --len=4 -vvvv /dev/sdb
  found bsg_major=253
  open /dev/sdb with flags=0x800
      inquiry cdb: 12 00 00 00 04 00
        duration=0 ms
      inquiry: pass-through requested 4 bytes (data-in) but got -28 bytes
      inquiry: pass-through can't get negative bytes, say it got none
      inquiry: got too few bytes (0)
  INQUIRY resid (32) should never exceed requested len=4
      inquiry: failed requesting 4 byte response: Malformed response to
               SCSI command [resid=32]

AFAICT the original change was not to address a specific host issue,
so go ahead and revert to original logic for now.
