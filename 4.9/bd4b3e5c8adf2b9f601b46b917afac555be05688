scsi: lpfc: Mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_sli.c:5693:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'lpfc_set_features' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_sli.c:8972:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'lpfc_sli_calc_ring' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

....

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.  So this
patch marks these functions with 'static'.
