kvm: create per-vcpu dirs in debugfs

This commit adds the ability for archs to export
per-vcpu information via a new per-vcpu dir in
the VM's debugfs directory.

If kvm_arch_has_vcpu_debugfs() returns true, then KVM
will create a vcpu dir for each vCPU in the VM's
debugfs directory. Then kvm_arch_create_vcpu_debugfs()
is responsible for populating each vcpu directory
with arch specific entries.

The per-vcpu path in debugfs will look like:

/sys/kernel/debug/kvm/29162-10/vcpu0
/sys/kernel/debug/kvm/29162-10/vcpu1

This is all arch specific for now because the only
user of this interface (x86) wants to export x86-specific
per-vcpu information to user-space.
