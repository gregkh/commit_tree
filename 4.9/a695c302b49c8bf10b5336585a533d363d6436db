greybus: audio: Added jack_type support in topology struct

This patch adds extra field jack_type to gb_audio_topology struct. Also,
it defines bit fields to be used by module while defining it's jack and
jack-button capabilities.

Currently, module can populate a single jack and associated buttons. In
case multiple jacks are supported data routing (say duplicating, etc.)
should be handled within module's FW. It can populate additional mixer
controls to do so.
