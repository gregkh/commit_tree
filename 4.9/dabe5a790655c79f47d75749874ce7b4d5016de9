rxrpc: Tidy up the rxrpc_call struct a bit

Do a little tidying of the rxrpc_call struct:

 (1) in_clientflag is no longer compared against the value that's in the
     packet, so keeping it in this form isn't necessary.  Use a flag in
     flags instead and provide a pair of wrapper functions.

 (2) We don't read the epoch value, so that can go.

 (3) Move what remains of the data that were used for hashing up in the
     struct to be with the channel number.

 (4) Get rid of the local pointer.  We can get at this via the socket
     struct and we only use this in the procfs viewer.
