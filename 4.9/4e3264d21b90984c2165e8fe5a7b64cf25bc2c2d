bpf: Fix bpf_redirect to an ipip/ip6tnl dev

If the bpf program calls bpf_redirect(dev, 0) and dev is
an ipip/ip6tnl, it currently includes the mac header.
e.g. If dev is ipip, the end result is IP-EthHdr-IP instead
of IP-IP.

The fix is to pull the mac header.  At ingress, skb_postpull_rcsum()
is not needed because the ethhdr should have been pulled once already
and then got pushed back just before calling the bpf_prog.
At egress, this patch calls skb_postpull_rcsum().

If bpf_redirect(dev, BPF_F_INGRESS) is called,
it also fails now because it calls dev_forward_skb() which
eventually calls eth_type_trans(skb, dev).  The eth_type_trans()
will set skb->type = PACKET_OTHERHOST because the mac address
does not match the redirecting dev->dev_addr.  The PACKET_OTHERHOST
will eventually cause the ip_rcv() errors out.  To fix this,
____dev_forward_skb() is added.

Joint work with Daniel Borkmann.
