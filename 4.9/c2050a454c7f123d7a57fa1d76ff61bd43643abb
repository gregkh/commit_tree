fs: Replace current_fs_time() with current_time()

current_fs_time() uses struct super_block* as an argument.
As per Linus's suggestion, this is changed to take struct
inode* as a parameter instead. This is because the function
is primarily meant for vfs inode timestamps.
Also the function was renamed as per Arnd's suggestion.

Change all calls to current_fs_time() to use the new
current_time() function instead. current_fs_time() will be
deleted.
