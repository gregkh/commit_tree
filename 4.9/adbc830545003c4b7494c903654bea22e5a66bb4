bnxt_en: Simplify PCI device names and add additinal PCI IDs.

Remove "Single-port/Dual-port" from the device names.  Dual-port devices
will appear as 2 separate devices, so no need to call each a dual-port
device.  Use a more generic name for VF devices belonging to the same
chip fanmily.  Add some remaining NPAR device IDs.
