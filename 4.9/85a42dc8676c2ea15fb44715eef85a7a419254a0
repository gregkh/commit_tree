staging: greybus: sdio: fix cmd_flags check for none response

When checking for command flags field if response is not available we
really need to compare it with the right define and not bitwise AND it.

smatch warn:
        drivers/staging/greybus/sdio.c:481 gb_sdio_command()
        warn: bitwise AND condition is false here
