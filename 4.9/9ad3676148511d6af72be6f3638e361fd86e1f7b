drm/i915: Remove locking for get_tiling

Since we are not concerned with userspace racing itself with set-tiling
(the order is indeterminant even if we take a lock), then we can safely
read back the single obj->tiling_mode and do the static lookup of
swizzle mode without having to take a lock.

get-tiling is reasonably frequent due to the back-channel passing around
of tiling parameters in DRI2/DRI3.

v2: Make tiling_mode a full unsigned int so that we can trivially use it
with READ_ONCE(). Separating it out into manual control over the flags
field was too noisy for a simple patch. Note that we could use the lower
bits of obj->stride for the tiling mode.
