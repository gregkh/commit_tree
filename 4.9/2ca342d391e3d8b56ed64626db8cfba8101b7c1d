regulator: axp20x: Support AXP806 variant

The X-Powers AXP806 PMIC has a new set of buck and LDO regulators, and
also a switch. The buck regulators support teaming into multi-phase
groups, with A+B, A+B+C, D+E groupings.

Some registers controlling DCDC converter work settings are at different
offsets. Deal with them as well.

Add support for this new variant.
