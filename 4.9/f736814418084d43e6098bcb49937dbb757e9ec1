staging/lustre/llite: changes to avoid cache corruption

ll_find_alias is responsible for getting alias for inode
which can be reused. Directories are assumed to have unique
alias, where in case of non-directories there can be multiple
aliases. In case of lustre there can be two type of aliases
i.e. discon_alias and invalid_alias. Usage of discon_alias in
case of non-directories may corrupt dcache and leads to kernel
crash. Changes made to avoid use of discon_alias in case of
non-directories.
