IB/hfi1: Cleanup tasklet refs in comments

The code no longer uses tasklets for the send engine. However it does
use a tasklet for sdma but the send routines use a workqueue now days.
Update the comments to reflect that. Make things more generic with
saying "send engine" because that is what is being referred to.
