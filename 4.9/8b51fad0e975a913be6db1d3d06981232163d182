pinctrl: nomadik: make abx500 explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

 config PINCTRL_ABX500
       bool "ST-Ericsson ABx500 family Mixed Signal Circuit gpio functions"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Note that MODULE_ALIAS is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
