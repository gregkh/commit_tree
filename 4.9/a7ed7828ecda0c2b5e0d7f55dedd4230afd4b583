brcmfmac: fix out of bound access on clearing wowl wake indicator

Clearing the wowl wakeindicator happens with a rather odd
construction where the string "clear" is used to set the iovar
wowl_wakeind. This was implemented incorrectly as it caused an
out of bound access. Use an intermediate variable of correct
length and copy string in that. Problem was found using coverity.
