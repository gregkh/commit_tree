fs/ocfs2/dlmfs: remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue()

The workqueue "user_dlm_worker" queues a single work item
&lockres->l_work per user_lock_res instance and so it doesn't require
execution ordering.  Hence, alloc_workqueue has been used to replace the
deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue instance.

The WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag has been set to ensure forward progress under
memory pressure.

Since there are fixed number of work items, explicit concurrency
limit is unnecessary here.
