perf tools: Recognize hugetlb mapping as anon mapping

Hugetlbfs mapping should be recognized as anon mapping so user has a
chance to create /tmp/perf-<pid>.map file for symbol resolving. This
patch utilizes MAP_HUGETLB to identify hugetlb mapping.

After this patch, if perf is started before a program starts using huge
pages (so perf gets MMAP2 events from kernel), perf is able to recognize
hugetlb mapping as anon mapping.
