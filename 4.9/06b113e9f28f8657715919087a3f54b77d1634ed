clk: xgene: Don't call __pa on ioremaped address

ioremaped addresses are not linearly mapped so the physical
address can not be figured out via __pa. More generally, there
is no guarantee that backing value of an ioremapped address
is a physical address at all. The value here is only used
for debugging so just drop the call to __pa on the ioremapped
address.
