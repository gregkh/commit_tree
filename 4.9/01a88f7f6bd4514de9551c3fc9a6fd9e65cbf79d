rxrpc: Fix call timer

Fix the call timer in the following ways:

 (1) If call->resend_at or call->ack_at are before or equal to the current
     time, then ignore that timeout.

 (2) If call->expire_at is before or equal to the current time, then don't
     set the timer at all (possibly we should queue the call).

 (3) Don't skip modifying the timer if timer_pending() is true.  This
     indicates that the timer is working, not that it has expired and is
     running/waiting to run its expiry handler.

Also call rxrpc_set_timer() to start the call timer going rather than
calling add_timer().
