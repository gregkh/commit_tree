i2c / ACPI: Do not touch an I2C device if it belongs to another adapter

When enumerating I2C devices connected to an I2C adapter we scan the whole
namespace (as it is possible to have devices anywhere in that namespace,
not just below the I2C adapter device) and add each found device to the I2C
bus in question.

Now after commit 525e6fabeae2 ("i2c / ACPI: add support for ACPI
reconfigure notifications") checking of the adapter handle to the one found
in the I2cSerialBus() resource was moved to happen after resources of the
I2C device has been parsed. This means that if the I2cSerialBus() resource
points to an adapter that does not exists in the system we still parse
those resources. This is problematic in particular because
acpi_dev_resource_interrupt() tries to configure GSI if the device also has
an Interrupt() resource. Failing to do that results errrors like this to be
printed on the console:

  [   10.409490] ERROR: Unable to locate IOAPIC for GSI 37

To fix this we pass the I2C adapter to i2c_acpi_get_info() and make sure
the handle matches the one in the I2cSerialBus() resource before doing
anything else to the device.
