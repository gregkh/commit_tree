bpf, test: fix ld_abs + vlan push/pop stress test

After commit 636c2628086e ("net: skbuff: Remove errornous length
validation in skb_vlan_pop()") mentioned test case stopped working,
throwing a -12 (ENOMEM) return code. The issue however is not due to
636c2628086e, but rather due to a buggy test case that got uncovered
from the change in behaviour in 636c2628086e.

The data_size of that test case for the skb was set to 1. In the
bpf_fill_ld_abs_vlan_push_pop() handler bpf insns are generated that
loop with: reading skb data, pushing 68 tags, reading skb data,
popping 68 tags, reading skb data, etc, in order to force a skb
expansion and thus trigger that JITs recache skb->data. Problem is
that initial data_size is too small.

While before 636c2628086e, the test silently bailed out due to the
skb->len < VLAN_ETH_HLEN check with returning 0, and now throwing an
error from failing skb_ensure_writable(). Set at least minimum of
ETH_HLEN as an initial length so that on first push of data, equivalent
pop will succeed.
