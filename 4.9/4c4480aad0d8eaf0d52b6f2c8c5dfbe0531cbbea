HID: sensor: fix attributes in HID sensor interface

User is unable to access to input-X-yyy and feature-X-yyy where
X is a hex value and more than 9 (e.g. input-a-yyy, feature-b-yyy) in HID
sensor custom sysfs interface.
This is because when creating the attribute, the attribute index is
written to using %x (hex). However, when reading and writing values into
the attribute, the attribute index is scanned using %d (decimal). Hence,
user is unable to access to attributes with index in hex values
(e.g. 'a', 'b', 'c') but able to access to attributes with index in
decimal values (e.g. 1, 2, 3,..).
This fix will change input-%d-%x-%s and feature-%d-%x-%s to input-%x-%x-%s
and feature-%x-%x-%s in show_values() and store_values() accordingly.
