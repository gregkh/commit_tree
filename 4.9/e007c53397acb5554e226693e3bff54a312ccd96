ia64: move exports to definitions

Here we have another kind of deviation from the default case -
a difference between exporting functions and non-functions.
EXPORT_DATA_SYMBOL... is really different from EXPORT_SYMBOL...
on ia64, and we need to use the right one when moving exports
from *.c where C compiler has the required information to
*.S, where we need to supply it manually.

parisc64 will be another one like that.
