cfg80211: limit scan results cache size

It's possible to make scanning consume almost arbitrary amounts
of memory, e.g. by sending beacon frames with random BSSIDs at
high rates while somebody is scanning.

Limit the number of BSS table entries we're willing to cache to
1000, limiting maximum memory usage to maybe 4-5MB, but lower
in practice - that would be the case for having both full-sized
beacon and probe response frames for each entry; this seems not
possible in practice, so a limit of 1000 entries will likely be
closer to 0.5 MB.
