drm/i915: Check pixel rate for DP to VGA dongle

Filter out a mode that exceeds the max pixel rate setting
for DP to VGA dongle. This is defined in DPCD register 0x81
if detailed cap info i.e. info field is 4 bytes long and
it is available for DP downstream port.

The register defines the pixel rate divided by 8 in MP/s.

v2: DPCD read outs and computation moved to drm (Ville, Daniel)
v3: Sink pixel rate computation moved to drm_dp_max_sink_dotclock()
    function (Daniel)
v4: Use of drm_dp_helper.c routines to compute max pixel clock (Ville)
v5: Use of intel_dp->downstream_ports to read out port capabilities.
    Code restructuring (Ville)
v6: Move DP branch device check to drm_dp_helper.c (Daniel)
v7: Cleanup as suggested by Ville
