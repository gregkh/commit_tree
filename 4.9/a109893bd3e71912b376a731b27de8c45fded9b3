irqchip/mvebu-pic: New driver for Marvell Armada 7K/8K PIC

The Marvell Armada 7K/8K integrates a secondary interrupt controller
very originally named "PIC". It is connected to the main GIC via a
PPI. Amongst other things, this PIC is used for the ARM PMU.

This commit adds a simple irqchip driver for this interrupt
controller. Since this interrupt controller is not needed early at boot
time, we make the driver a proper platform driver rather than use the
IRQCHIP_DECLARE() mechanism.
