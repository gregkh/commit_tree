KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Move struct kvmppc_vcore from kvm_host.h to kvm_book3s.h

The next commit will introduce a member to the kvmppc_vcore struct which
references MAX_SMT_THREADS which is defined in kvm_book3s_asm.h, however
this file isn't included in kvm_host.h directly. Thus compiling for
certain platforms such as pmac32_defconfig and ppc64e_defconfig with KVM
fails due to MAX_SMT_THREADS not being defined.

Move the struct kvmppc_vcore definition to kvm_book3s.h which explicitly
includes kvm_book3s_asm.h.
