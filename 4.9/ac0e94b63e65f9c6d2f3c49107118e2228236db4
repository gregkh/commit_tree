x86/efi: Initialize status to ensure garbage is not returned on small size

Although very unlikey, if size is too small or zero, then we end up with
status not being set and returning garbage. Instead, initializing status to
EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER to indicate that size is invalid in the calls to
setup_uga32 and setup_uga64.
