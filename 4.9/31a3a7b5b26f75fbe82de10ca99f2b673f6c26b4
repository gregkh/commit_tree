PCI: rockchip: Add three new resets as required properties

pm_rst, aclk_rst, pclk_rst was controlled by ROM code so the software
wasn't needed to control it again in theory.  But it didn't work properly,
so we do need to do it again and add enough delay between the assert of
pm_rst and the deassert of pm_rst.  The Soc intergrated with this
controller, rk3399, is still under MP test internally, so the backward
compatibility won't be a big deal.
