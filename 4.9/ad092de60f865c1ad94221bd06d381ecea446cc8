i2c: i2c-mux-pca954x: fix deselect enabling for device-tree

Deselect functionality can be ignored for device-trees with
"i2c-mux-idle-disconnect" entries if no platform_data is available.
By enabling the deselect functionality outside the platform_data
block the logic works as it did in previous kernels.
