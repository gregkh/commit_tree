arm64: KVM: Move the AArch32 conditional execution to common code

It would make some sense to share the conditional execution code
between 32 and 64bit. In order to achieve this, let's move that
code to virt/kvm/arm/aarch32.c. While we're at it, drop a
superfluous BUG_ON() that wasn't that useful.

Following patches will migrate the 32bit port to that code base.
