staging: lustre: client: Fix mkdir -i 1 from DNE2 client to DNE1 server

After DNE phase 2 has been added to client it sends
create request to slave MDT.  DNT1-only server doesn't
expect request to slave MDT from client. It expects
only cross-mdt request from master MDT. Thus if DNE2
client tries to "mkdir -i 1" on DNE1 server, then
LBUG happened.

This patch adds OBD_CONNECT_DIR_STRIPE connection
flag check on client side. If striped directories are not
supported by server, then create requrest is sent to
master MDT.
