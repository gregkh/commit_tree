NFSv4: Fix CLOSE races with OPEN

If the reply to a successful CLOSE call races with an OPEN to the same
file, we can end up scribbling over the stateid that represents the
new open state.
The race looks like:

  Client				Server
  ======				======

  CLOSE stateid A on file "foo"
					CLOSE stateid A, return stateid C
  OPEN file "foo"
					OPEN "foo", return stateid B
  Receive reply to OPEN
  Reset open state for "foo"
  Associate stateid B to "foo"

  Receive CLOSE for A
  Reset open state for "foo"
  Replace stateid B with C

The fix is to examine the argument of the CLOSE, and check for a match
with the current stateid "other" field. If the two do not match, then
the above race occurred, and we should just ignore the CLOSE.
