greybus: bootrom: Skip setting timeout in failure path of size request

The currently set value of next_request_type in the error path of
gb_bootrom_firmware_size_request() is not correct, as it should have
been NEXT_REQ_FIRMWARE_SIZE for the failure case (as we should be
waiting for another similar request).

But, if an error occurs in gb_bootrom_firmware_size_request(), then the
ES3 bootrom will never be able to recover from it and send another
request. And so there is no point waiting for another request and timing
out.

Skip doing that in error path.
