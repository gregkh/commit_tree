scsi: pmcraid: mark symbols static where possible

We get 4 warnings about global functions without a declaration
in the scsi pmcraid driver when building with W=1:
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:309:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'pmcraid_init_cmdblk' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:404:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'pmcraid_return_cmd' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:1713:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'pmcraid_ioasc_logger' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c:3141:1: warning: no previous prototype for 'pmcraid_init_ioadls' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which it is
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.  so this
patch marks it 'static'.
