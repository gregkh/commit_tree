greybus: prepend cport byte for all gbufs

Treat communication buffers for both inbound and outbound data the
same way, prepending a "destination cport id" byte before the data
in the buffer.  Currently this is done only for outbound data
buffers.

This isn't needed for inbound data, but handling it this way
allows the free routine to work without knowing whether the
buffer was used for sending or receiving.
