xfs: update atime before I/O in xfs_file_dio_aio_read

After the call to __blkdev_direct_IO the final reference to the file
might have been dropped by aio_complete already, and the call to
file_accessed might cause a use after free.

Instead update the access time before the I/O, similar to how we
update the time stamps before writes.
