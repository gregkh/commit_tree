powerpc/64: Do load of PACAKBASE in LOAD_HANDLER

The LOAD_HANDLER macro requires that you have previously loaded "reg"
with PACAKBASE. Although that gives callers flexibility to get PACAKBASE
in some interesting way, none of the callers actually do that. So fold
the load of PACAKBASE into the macro, making it simpler for callers to
use correctly.
