clk: bcm2835: Skip PLLC clocks when deciding on a new clock parent

If the firmware had set up a clock to source from PLLC, go along with
it.  But if we're looking for a new parent, we don't want to switch it
to PLLC because the firmware will force PLLC (and thus the AXI bus
clock) to different frequencies during over-temp/under-voltage,
without notification to Linux.

On my system, this moves the Linux-enabled HDMI state machine and DSI1
escape clock over to plld_per from pllc_per.  EMMC still ends up on
pllc_per, because the firmware had set it up to use that.
