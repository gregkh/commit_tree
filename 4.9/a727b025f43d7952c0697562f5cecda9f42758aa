tty: serial_core: add tty NULL check to uart_tx_stopped

Commit 761ed4a94582 ("tty: serial_core: convert uart_close to use
tty_port_close") created a case where a port used for a console does not
get shutdown on tty closing. Then a call to uart_tx_stopped() segfaults
because the tty is NULL. This could be fixed to restore old behavior,
but we also want to allow tty_ports to work without a tty attached. So
this change to allow a NULL tty_struct is needed either way.
