fs/afs/rxrpc: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

The workqueue "afs_async_calls" queues work item
&call->async_work per afs_call. Since there could be multiple calls and since
these calls can be run concurrently, alloc_workqueue has been used to replace
the deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue instance.

The WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag has been set to ensure forward progress under
memory pressure because the workqueue is being used on a memory reclaim
path.

Since there are fixed number of work items, explicit concurrency
limit is unnecessary here.
