coresight: access conn->child_name only if it's initialised

If the addition of the coresight devices get deferred, then there's a
window before child_name is populated by of_get_coresight_platform_data
from the respective component driver's probe and the attempted to access
the same from coresight_orphan_match resulting in kernel NULL pointer
dereference as below:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0x0

This patch adds a check for non-NULL conn->child_name before accessing
the same.
