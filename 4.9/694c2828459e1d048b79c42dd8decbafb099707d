drm/i915: i915_sysfs.c cleanup

Various cleanup for i915_sysfs.c; we now use dev_priv whenever
possible. The kdev_to_drm_minor() helper function has been
replaced by one that converts from struct device *
to struct drm_i915_private *.

We already have a seemingly identical helper (kdev_to_i915())
in i915_drv.h. But that one cannot be used here.
Unlike the version in i915_drv.h, this helper
reaches i915 through drm_minor.

v2: Rename kdev_to_i915_dm() to kdev_minor_to_i915() (Chris)
