perf/core: Fix address filter parser

The token table passed into match_token() must be null-terminated, which
it currently is not in the perf's address filter string parser, as caught
by Vince's perf_fuzzer and KASAN.

It doesn't blow up otherwise because of the alignment padding of the table
to the next element in the .rodata, which is luck.

Fixing by adding a null-terminator to the token table.
