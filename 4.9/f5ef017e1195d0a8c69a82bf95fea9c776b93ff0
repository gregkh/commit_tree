be2net: NCSI FW section should be properly updated with ethtool for BE3

The driver has a check to ensure that NCSI FW section is updated only
if the current FW version in the card supports it. This FW version check
is done using memcmp() which obviously fails in some cases. Fix this by
breaking up the version string into integer version components and
comparing them.
