greybus: October 1 updates

Update the definitions in "greybus_manifest.h" to reflect the
changes to the Greybus specification made on October 1.

They are:
    - renaming "device" to be "interface"
    - renumbering greybus descriptor type
    - eliminating the notion of a "function"
    - defining a CPort's protocol in the CPort descriptor
    - having a "class" take on the types previously used for "function"
    - renaming "serial number" to be "unique id" (for now)
    - relying on an interface's maximum cport id to determine how
      much device+cport address space the interface consumes
    - adding a simple class descriptor
    - renaming gb_interface->interface_id to be gb_interface->id

This also reorders some things to match ordering in the document,
and adds some commentary for the various structures.

Since greybus_function_type is gone, we eliminate the "type" field
from a function structure.  (Functions are going away, next.)
