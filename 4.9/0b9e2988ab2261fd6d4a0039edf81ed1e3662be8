ahci: use pci_alloc_irq_vectors

Use the new pci_alloc_irq_vectors API to allocate MSI-X and MSI vectors.
The big advantage over the old code is that we can use the same API for
MSI and MSI-X, and that we don't need to store the MSI-X vector mapping
in driver-private data structures.

This first conversion keeps the probe order as-is: MSI-X multi vector,
MSI multi vector, MSI single vector, MSI-X single vector and last a
single least legacy interrupt line.  There is one small change of
behavior: we now check the "MSI Revert to Single Message" flag for
MSI-X in addition to MSI.

Because the API to find the Linux IRQ number for a MSI/MSI-X vector
is PCI specific, but libahaci is bus-agnostic I had to a
get_irq_vector function pointer to struct ahci_host_priv.  The
alternative would be to move the multi-vector case of ahci_host_activate
to ahci.c and just call ata_host_activate directly from the others
users of ahci_host_activate.
