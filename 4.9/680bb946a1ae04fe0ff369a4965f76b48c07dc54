fix iov_iter_advance() for ITER_PIPE

iov_iter_advance() needs to decrement iter->count by the number of
bytes we'd moved beyond.  Normal flavours do that, but ITER_PIPE
doesn't and ITER_PIPE generic_file_read_iter() for O_DIRECT files
ends up with a bogus fallback to page cache read, resulting in incorrect
values for file offset and bytes read.
