sbitmap: re-initialize allocation hints after resize

After a struct sbitmap_queue is resized smaller, the allocation hints
may still be set to bits beyond the new depth of the bitmap. This means
that, for example, if the number of blk-mq tags is reduced through
sysfs, more requests than the nominal queue depth may be in flight.

It's tempting to fix this at resize time by doing a one-time
reinitialization of the hints, but this can race with
__sbitmap_queue_get() updating the hint. Instead, check the hint before
we use it. This caused no measurable performance difference in my
synthetic benchmarks.
