tcp: use windowed min filter library for TCP min_rtt estimation

Refactor the TCP min_rtt code to reuse the new win_minmax library in
lib/win_minmax.c to simplify the TCP code.

This is a pure refactor: the functionality is exactly the same. We
just moved the windowed min code to make TCP easier to read and
maintain, and to allow other parts of the kernel to use the windowed
min/max filter code.
