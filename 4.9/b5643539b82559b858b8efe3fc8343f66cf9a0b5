platform/x86: asus-wmi: Filter buggy scan codes on ASUS Q500A

Some revisions of the ASUS Q500A series have a keyboard related
issue which is reproducible only after Windows with installed ASUS
tools is started.

In this case the Linux side will have a blocked keyboard or
report incorrect or incomplete hotkey events.

To make Linux work properly again, a complete power down
(unplug power supply and remove battery) is needed.

Linux/atkbd after a clean start will get the following code on VOLUME_UP
key: {0xe0, 0x30, 0xe0, 0xb0}. After Windows, the same key will generate
this codes: {0xe1, 0x23, 0xe0, 0x30, 0xe0, 0xb0}. As result atkdb will
be confused by buggy codes.

This patch is filtering this buggy code out.
