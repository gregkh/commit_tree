libnvdimm, namespace: allow multiple pmem-namespaces per region at scan time

If label scanning finds multiple valid pmem namespaces allow them to be
surfaced rather than fail namespace scanning. Support for creating
multiple namespaces per region is saved for a later patch.

Note that this adds some new error messages to clarify which of the pmem
namespaces in the set are potentially impacted by invalid labels.
