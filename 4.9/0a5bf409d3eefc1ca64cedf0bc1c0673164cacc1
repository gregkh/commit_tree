ptrace: clear TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE on ptrace detach

On __ptrace_detach(), called from do_exit()->exit_notify()->
forget_original_parent()->exit_ptrace(), the TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE in
thread->flags of the tracee is not cleared up.  This results in the
tracehook_report_syscall_* being called (though there's no longer a tracer
listening to that) upon its further syscalls.

Example scenario - attach "strace" to a running process and kill it (the
strace) with SIGKILL.  You'll see that the syscall trace hooks are still
being called.

The clearing of this flag should be moved from ptrace_detach() to
__ptrace_detach().
