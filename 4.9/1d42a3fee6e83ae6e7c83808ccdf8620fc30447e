drm/msm/mdp5: Set rotation property initial value to DRM_ROTATE_0 insted of 0

0 isn't a valid rotation property value, so let's set the initial value
of the property to DRM_ROTATE_0 instead.

In the same vein, we must always have at leat one angle as part of set
of supported rotation bits, so let's include DRM_ROTATE_0 in there.
