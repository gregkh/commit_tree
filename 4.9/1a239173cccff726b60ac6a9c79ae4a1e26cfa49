ipv4: Drop leaf from suffix pull/push functions

It wasn't necessary to pass a leaf in when doing the suffix updates so just
drop it.  Instead just pass the suffix and work with that.

Since we dropped the leaf there is no need to include that in the name so
the names are updated to node_push_suffix and node_pull_suffix.

Finally I noticed that the logic for pulling the suffix length back
actually had some issues.  Specifically it would stop prematurely if there
was a longer suffix, but it was not as long as the original suffix.  I
updated the code to address that in node_pull_suffix.
