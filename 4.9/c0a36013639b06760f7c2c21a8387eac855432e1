powerpc/64: Fix setting of AIL in hypervisor mode

Commit d3cbff1b5 "powerpc: Put exception configuration in a common place"
broke the setting of the AIL bit (which enables taking exceptions with
the MMU still on) on all processors, moving it incorrectly to a function
called only on the boot CPU. This was correct for the guest case but
not when running in hypervisor mode.

This fixes it by partially reverting that commit, putting the setting
back in cpu_ready_for_interrupts()
