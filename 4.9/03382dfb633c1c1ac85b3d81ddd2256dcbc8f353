drm/i915: Print the batchbuffer offset next to BBADDR in error state

It is useful when looking at captured error states to check the recorded
BBADDR register (the address of the last batchbuffer instruction loaded)
against the expected offset of the batch buffer, and so do a quick check
that (a) the capture is true or (b) HEAD hasn't wandered off into the
badlands.
