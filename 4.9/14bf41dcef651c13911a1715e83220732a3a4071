scsi: mvsas: Mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/scsi/mvsas/mv_sas.c:77:18: warning: no previous prototype for 'mvs_find_dev_mvi' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/mvsas/mv_sas.c:105:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'mvs_find_dev_phyno' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

drivers/scsi/mvsas/mv_64xx.c:566:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'mvs_64xx_make_prd' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
....

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.  So this
patch marks these functions with 'static'.
