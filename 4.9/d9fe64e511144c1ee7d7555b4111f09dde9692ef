net: asix: Add in_pm parameter

From: Freddy Xin <freddy@asix.com.tw>

In order to R/W registers in suspend/resume functions, in_pm flags are
added to some functions to determine whether the nopm version of usb
functions is called.

Save BMCR and ANAR PHY registers in suspend function and restore them
in resume function.

Reset HW in resume function to ensure the PHY works correctly.
