rcutorture: Print out barrier error as document says

Tests for rcu_barrier() were introduced by commit fae4b54f28f0 ("rcu:
Introduce rcutorture testing for rcu_barrier()").  This commit updated
the documentation to say that the "rtbe" field in rcutorture's dmesg
output indicates test failure.  However, the code was not updated, only
the documentation.  This commit therefore updates the code to match the
updated documentation.
