greybus: fix a timeout race

Whenever we send a request message we start a timer to ensure the
we don't wait too long for the matching response to arrive.
Currently we set up the timeout *after* sending the message, but
that is subject to a race--the response could arrive (and the
timeout prematurely disabled) before the timeout is even set up.

Set up the timeout before sending the message.
