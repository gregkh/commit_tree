i2c: uniphier-f: set the adapter to master mode when probing

Currently, the adapter is set to the master mode at the first use.
Since then, it is kept in the slave mode, so unexpected glitch
signals on the I2C lines may cause the adapter into insane state.
Setting it to the master mode along with initialization solves the
problem.
