fuse: Add posix ACL support

Add a new INIT flag, FUSE_POSIX_ACL, for negotiating ACL support with
userspace.  When it is set in the INIT response, ACL support will be
enabled.  ACL support also implies "default_permissions".

When ACL support is enabled, the kernel will cache and have responsibility
for enforcing ACLs.  ACL xattrs will be passed to userspace, which is
responsible for updating the ACLs in the filesystem, keeping the file mode
in sync, and inheritance of default ACLs when new filesystem nodes are
created.
