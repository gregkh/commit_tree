KVM: PPC: Book3S: Don't crash if irqfd used with no in-kernel XICS emulation

It turns out that if userspace creates a pseries-type VM without
in-kernel XICS (interrupt controller) emulation, and then connects
an eventfd to the VM as an irqfd, and the eventfd gets signalled,
that the code will try to deliver an interrupt via the non-existent
XICS object and crash the host kernel with a NULL pointer dereference.

To fix this, we check for the presence of the XICS object before
trying to deliver the interrupt, and return with an error if not.
