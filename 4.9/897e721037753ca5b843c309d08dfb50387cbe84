thermal: bang-bang governor: act on lower trip boundary

With interrupt driven thermal zones we pass the lower and upper
temperature on which shall be acted, so in the governor we have to act on
the exact lower temperature to be consistent. Otherwise an interrupt maybe
generated on the exact lower temperature, but the bang bang governor does
not react since The polling driven zones have to be one step cooler before
the governor reacts.
