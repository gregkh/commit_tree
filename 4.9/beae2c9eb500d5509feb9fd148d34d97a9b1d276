crypto: aesni: shut up -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

The rfc4106 encrypy/decrypt helper functions cause an annoying
false-positive warning in allmodconfig if we turn on
-Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings again:

  arch/x86/crypto/aesni-intel_glue.c: In function ‘helper_rfc4106_decrypt’:
  include/linux/scatterlist.h:67:31: warning: ‘dst_sg_walk.sg’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

The problem seems to be that the compiler doesn't track the state of the
'one_entry_in_sg' variable across the kernel_fpu_begin/kernel_fpu_end
section.

This takes the easy way out by adding a bogus initialization, which
should be harmless enough to get the patch into v4.9 so we can turn on
this warning again by default without producing useless output.  A
follow-up patch for v4.10 rearranges the code to make the warning go
away.
