arm64: head.S: use ordinary stack frame for __primary_switched()

Instead of stashing the value of the link register in x28 before setting
up the stack and calling into C code, create an ordinary PCS compatible
stack frame so that we can push the return address onto the stack.

Since exception handlers require a stack as well, assign the stack pointer
register before installing the vector table.

Note that this accounts for the difference between THREAD_START_SP and
THREAD_SIZE, given that the stack pointer is always decremented before
calling into any C code.
