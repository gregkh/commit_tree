ALSA: bebob: rename file with vendor-dependent code so that it's for Yamaha/Terratec

Once Yamaha and Terratec cooperated to develop some audio and music units
on IEEE 1394 bus. On these models, the same embedded board is used, and
similar configurations are also applied.

This commit renames file for Yamaha's configuration so that it's for both
of Yamaha and Terratec.
