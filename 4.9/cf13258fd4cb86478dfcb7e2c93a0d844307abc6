rxrpc: Fix ASSERTCMP and ASSERTIFCMP to handle signed values

Fix ASSERTCMP and ASSERTIFCMP to be able to handle signed values by casting
both parameters to the type of the first before comparing.  Without this,
both values are cast to unsigned long, which means that checks for values
less than zero don't work.

The downside of this is that the state enum values in struct rxrpc_call and
struct rxrpc_connection can't be bitfields as __typeof__ can't handle them.
