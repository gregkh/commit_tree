[media] v4l2-core: Add support for touch devices

Some touch controllers send out touch data in a similar way to a
greyscale frame grabber.

Add new device type VFL_TYPE_TOUCH:
- This uses a new device prefix v4l-touch for these devices, to stop
  generic capture software from treating them as webcams. Otherwise,
  touch is treated similarly to video capture.
- Add V4L2_INPUT_TYPE_TOUCH
- Add MEDIA_INTF_T_V4L_TOUCH
- Add V4L2_CAP_TOUCH to indicate device is a touch device

Add formats:
- V4L2_TCH_FMT_DELTA_TD16 for signed 16-bit touch deltas
- V4L2_TCH_FMT_DELTA_TD08 for signed 16-bit touch deltas
- V4L2_TCH_FMT_TU16 for unsigned 16-bit touch data
- V4L2_TCH_FMT_TU08 for unsigned 8-bit touch data

This support will be used by:
- Atmel maXTouch (atmel_mxt_ts)
- Synaptics RMI4.
- sur40
