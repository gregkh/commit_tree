staging: fsl-mc: rename mc-private.h to mc-bus.h

The definitions in mc-private.h are not strictly speaking
'private', they are bus-related definitions expected to be
referenced by bus driver components as well as system components
(gic, smmu, vfio).  Rename mc-private.h to mc-bus.h to more
accurately reflect expected use.
