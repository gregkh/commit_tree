drm/i915: pdev cleanup

In an effort to simplify things for a future push of dev_priv instead
of dev wherever possible, always take pdev via dev_priv where
feasible, eliminating the direct access from dev. Right now this
only eliminates a few cases of dev, but it also obviates that we pass
dev into a lot of functions where dev_priv would be the more obvious
choice.

v2: Fixed one more place missing in the previous patch set
