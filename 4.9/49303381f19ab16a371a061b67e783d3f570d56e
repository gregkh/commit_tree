Btrfs: bail out if block group has different mixed flag

Currently we allow inconsistence about mixed flag
 (BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_METADATA | BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_DATA).

We'd get ENOSPC if block group has mixed flag and btrfs doesn't.
If that happens, we have one space_info with mixed flag and another
space_info only with BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_METADATA, and
global_block_rsv.space_info points to the latter one, but all bytes
from block_group contributes to the mixed space_info, thus all the
allocation will fail with ENOSPC.

This adds a check for the above case.
