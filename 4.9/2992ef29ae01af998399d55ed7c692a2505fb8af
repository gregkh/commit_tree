livepatch/module: make TAINT_LIVEPATCH module-specific

There's no reliable way to determine which module tainted the kernel
with TAINT_LIVEPATCH.  For example, /sys/module/<klp module>/taint
doesn't report it.  Neither does the "mod -t" command in the crash tool.

Make it crystal clear who the guilty party is by associating
TAINT_LIVEPATCH with any module which sets the "livepatch" modinfo
attribute.  The flag will still get set in the kernel like before, but
now it also sets the same flag in mod->taint.

Note that now the taint flag gets set when the module is loaded rather
than when it's enabled.

I also renamed find_livepatch_modinfo() to check_modinfo_livepatch() to
better reflect its purpose: it's basically a livepatch-specific
sub-function of check_modinfo().
