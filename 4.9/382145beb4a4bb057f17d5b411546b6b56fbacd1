greybus: hid: fix missing input verification of report events

Add minimal verification of incoming report size, before using it to
determine what buffer and size to pass on to HID core.

Add comment about protocol needing to be revisited. If we are going to
be parsing the report data received, then those fields have to be
defined in the Greybus specification at least.
