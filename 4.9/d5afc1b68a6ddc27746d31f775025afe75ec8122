dmaengine: cppi41: More PM runtime fixes

Fix use of u32 instead of int for checking for negative errors values
as pointed out by Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>.

And while testing the PM runtime error path by randomly returning
failed values in runtime resume, I noticed two more places that need
fixing:

- If pm_runtime_get_sync() fails in probe, we still need to do
  pm_runtime_put_sync() to keep the use count happy. We could call
  pm_runtime_put_noidle() on the error path, but we're just going
  to call pm_runtime_disable() after that so pm_runtime_put_sync()
  will do what we want

- We should print an error if pm_runtime_get_sync() fails in
  cppi41_dma_alloc_chan_resources() so we know where it happens
