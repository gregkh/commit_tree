net: ethtool: add support for 1000BaseX and missing 10G link modes

This patch enhances ethtool link mode bitmap to include
missing interface modes for 1G/10G speeds

Changes:
1000baseX is the mode introduced to cover all 1G Fiber cases.
All modes under 1000BaseX i.e. 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, 1000BASE-LX10
and 1000BASE-BX10 are not explicitly defined at this moment.
10G CR,SR,LR and ER link modes are included for 10G speed..

Issue:
ethtool on  1G/10G SFP port reports Base-T
as this port supports 1000baseX,10G CR, SR and LR modes.

root@tor-02$ ethtool swp1
Settings for swp1:
        Supported ports: [ FIBRE ]
        Supported link modes:   1000baseT/Full
                                10000baseT/Full
        Supported pause frame use: Symmetric Receive-only
        Supports auto-negotiation: Yes
        Advertised link modes:  1000baseT/Full
        Advertised pause frame use: No
        Advertised auto-negotiation: No
