arm64: dts: qcom: Fix broken interrupt trigger settings

When a device uses the GIC as its interrupt controller and generates
SPIs, only the values 1 (edge rising) and 4 (level high) are legal.

Anything else is just plain wrong (can't be programmed into the HW),
and leads to aborted driver probes (USB doesn't work with 4.8-rc1
on a Dragonboard 410C).
