greybus: Revert "bootrom: Implement timeouts to detect Module failures"

This reverts commit 571348253032a86e4f0102d4dfadd390d0ea7e64.

With this patch gb_bootrom_timedout was getting called in interrupt
context and then proceeding to call functions that might block. In
practical terms, this was leading to a kernel BUG at mm/vmalloc.c:1650.
