x86/efi: Map in physical addresses in efi_map_region_fixed

This is a simple change to add in the physical mappings as well as the
virtual mappings in efi_map_region_fixed.  The motivation here is to
get access to EFI runtime code that is only available via the 1:1
mappings on a kexec'd kernel.

The added call is essentially the kexec analog of the first __map_region
that Boris put in efi_map_region in commit d2f7cbe7b26a ("x86/efi:
Runtime services virtual mapping").
