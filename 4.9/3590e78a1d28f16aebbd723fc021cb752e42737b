staging: rtl8192u: ieee80211: ieee80211_softmac: mark symbols static where possible

We get 5 warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/staging/rtl8192u/ieee80211/ieee80211_softmac.c:287:13: warning: no previous declaration for 'softmac_ps_mgmt_xmit' [-Wmissing-declarations]

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
