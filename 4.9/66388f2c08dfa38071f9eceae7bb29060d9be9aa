sctp: do not return the transmit err back to sctp_sendmsg

Once a chunk is enqueued successfully, sctp queues can take care of it.
Even if it is failed to transmit (like because of nomem), it should be
put into retransmit queue.

If sctp report this error to users, it confuses them, they may resend
that msg, but actually in kernel sctp stack is in charge of retransmit
it already.

Besides, this error probably is not from the failure of transmitting
current msg, but transmitting or retransmitting another msg's chunks,
as sctp_outq_flush just tries to send out all transports' chunks.

This patch is to make sctp_cmd_send_msg return avoid, and not return the
transmit err back to sctp_sendmsg
