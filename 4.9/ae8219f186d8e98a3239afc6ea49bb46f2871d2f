libnvdimm, label: convert label tracking to a linked list

In preparation for enabling multiple namespaces per pmem region, convert
the label tracking to use a linked list.  In particular this will allow
select_pmem_id() to move labels from the unvalidated state to the
validated state.  Currently we only track one validated set per-region.
