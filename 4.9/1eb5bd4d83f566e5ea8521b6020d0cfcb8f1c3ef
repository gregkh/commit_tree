mei: drop read complete queue emptiness check

In the course of the read flow we want to wait for read completion only
if the read queue is empty.
However the calling list_empty(&cl->rd_completed) is a duplication as the
same check was performed by mei_cl_read_cb() and the waiting is skipped
if it returns not NULL.
