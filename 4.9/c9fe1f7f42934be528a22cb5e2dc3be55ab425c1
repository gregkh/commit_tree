staging: lustre: Flexible changelog format.

Added jobid fields to Changelog records (and extended records). The
CLF_JOBID flags allows to check if the field is present or not (old
format) when reading an entry. Jobids are expressed as 32 chars long,
zero-terminated strings. Updated test_205 in sanity.sh.
