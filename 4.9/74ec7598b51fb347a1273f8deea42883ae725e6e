greybus: es2: add support for greybus cport flags

Add support for Greybus CPort flags that are sent to the bridge through
a new USB vendor request when enabling a CPort as part of connection
establishment.

Currently the Greybus control and high-priority connection flags are
recognised and forwarded to APBA.
