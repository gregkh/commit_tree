greybus: svc: reconfig APBridgeA-Switch link to handle required load

SW-4894, SW-4389, and share a common root cause, namely that
the power-on reset configuration of the APBridgeA-Switch link of PWM
Gear 1, 1 Lane, Slow Auto, is insufficient to handle some required
traffic loads, such as 3 audio streams plus boot-over-UniPro or 4 audio
streams.

The correct long-term solution is to implement a UniPro Power Mode
Manager as in that considers the demands placed on the network,
and adjusts power modes accordingly.

The present commit implements a short-term, brute-force hack to allow
continued system testing:
- Upon receiving an SVC HELLO request, schedule deferred work to
  reconfigure the APB1-Switch link to PWM G2, 1 lane, Slow Auto
- When the Camera driver transitions a White Camera module from active to
  inactive, return the APB1-Switch link to PWM G2, 1 lane, Slow Auto

The Camera driver already steps up the APBridgeA-Camera link speed while a
camera module is active, which affords sufficient margin for simultaneous
audio and hotplug activity, and the Camera driver already steps down the
link speed thereafter: the change made by the present patch is simply to
tweak the stepped-down power mode to match the new baseline configuration.
