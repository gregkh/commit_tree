proc: don't use FOLL_FORCE for reading cmdline and environment

Now that Lorenzo cleaned things up and made the FOLL_FORCE users
explicit, it becomes obvious how some of them don't really need
FOLL_FORCE at all.

So remove FOLL_FORCE from the proc code that reads the command line and
arguments from user space.

The mem_rw() function actually does want FOLL_FORCE, because gdd (and
possibly many other debuggers) use it as a much more convenient version
of PTRACE_PEEKDATA, but we should consider making the FOLL_FORCE part
conditional on actually being a ptracer.  This does not actually do
that, just moves adds a comment to that effect and moves the gup_flags
settings next to each other.
