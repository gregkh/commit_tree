PCI/AER: Avoid memory allocation in interrupt handling path

When handling AER events, we previously allocated a struct aer_err_info,
processed the error, and freed the struct.  But aer_isr_one_error() is
serialized by rpc_mutex, so we never need more than one copy of the struct,
and the struct is only about 70 bytes, so we're not saving much by
allocating it dynamically.

Embed a struct aer_err_info directly in struct aer_rpc, which is allocated
at probe-time by aer_probe().
