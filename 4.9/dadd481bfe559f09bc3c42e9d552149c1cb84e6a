drm/i915/guc: Prepare for nonblocking execbuf submission

Currently the presumption is that the request construction and its
submission to the GuC are all under the same holding of struct_mutex. We
wish to relax this to separate the request construction and the later
submission to the GuC. This requires us to reserve some space in the
GuC command queue for the future submission. For flexibility to handle
out-of-order request submission we do not preallocate the next slot in
the GuC command queue during request construction, just ensuring that
there is enough space later.
