ALSA: usb: use TEAC UD-H01 quirk for more devices

The quirk seems to be necessary not only for TEAC UD-H01 devices, but to
more that are based on the Tenor 8802TL chipset. Devices built by T+A
are affected too, and they apparently all use the same USB PID:PID.

Extend the quirky handling for that device as well, and rename the
quirks flag.
