gp8psk-fe: add missing MODULE_foo() macros

This file was converted to a separate module at commit 7a0786c19d65
("gp8psk: Fix DVB frontend attach"), because the DVB attach routines
require it to work.  However, I forgot to copy the MODULE_foo() macros
from the original module, causing this warning:

    WARNING: modpost: missing MODULE_LICENSE() in drivers/media/dvb-frontends/gp8psk-fe.o
