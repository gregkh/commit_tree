net: inet: diag: expose the socket mark to privileged processes.

This adds the capability for a process that has CAP_NET_ADMIN on
a socket to see the socket mark in socket dumps.

Commit a52e95abf772 ("net: diag: allow socket bytecode filters to
match socket marks") recently gave privileged processes the
ability to filter socket dumps based on mark. This patch is
complementary: it ensures that the mark is also passed to
userspace in the socket's netlink attributes.  It is useful for
tools like ss which display information about sockets.
