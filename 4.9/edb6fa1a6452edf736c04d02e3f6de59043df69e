MIPS: Return -ENODEV from weak implementation of rtc_mips_set_time

The sync_cmos_clock function in kernel/time/ntp.c first tries to update
the internal clock of the cpu by calling the "update_persistent_clock64"
architecture specific function.  If this returns -ENODEV, it then tries
to update an external RTC using "rtc_set_ntp_time".

On the mips architecture, the weak implementation of the underlying
function would return 0 if it wasn't overridden.  This meant that the
sync_cmos_clock function would never try to update an external RTC
(if both CONFIG_GENERIC_CMOS_UPDATE and CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC are
configured)

Returning -ENODEV instead, means that an external RTC will be tried.
