HID: hid-dr: add input mapping for axis selection

Commit 79346d620e9d ("HID: input: force generic axis to be mapped to their
user space axis") made mapping generic axes to their userspace equivalents
mandatory and some lower end gamepads which were depending on the previous
behaviour suffered severe regressions because they were reusing axes and
expecting hid-input to multiplex their map to the respective userspace axis
by always searching for and using the next available axis.

One solution is to add a hid quirk for this type of "previous" behaviour in
hid-input to bypass the new axes policy in favour of the old one, but since
only one hardware vendor seems to be affected negatively we're better off
making and exception and mapping in the driver for now; if more vendors or
drivers turn out to experience the problem we should reconsider the quirk
solution.
