mmc: sdhci: Do not allow tuning procedure to be interrupted

wait_event_interruptible_timeout() will return early if the blocked
process receives a signal, causing the driver to abort the tuning
procedure and possibly leaving the controller in a bad state.  Since the
tuning command is expected to complete quickly (<50ms) and we've set a
timeout, use wait_event_timeout() instead.
