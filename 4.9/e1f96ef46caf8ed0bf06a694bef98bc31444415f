drm: drop DRIVER_HAVE_IRQ flag for some drivers

Since commit 4984979b9b90 ("drm/irq: simplify irq checks in
drm_wait_vblank"), the drm driver feature flag DRIVER_HAVE_IRQ is only
required for drivers that have an IRQ handler managed by the DRM core.
Some drivers, armada, etnaviv, kirin and sti, set this flag without
.irq_handler setup in drm_driver.  These drivers manage IRQ handler
by themselves and the flag DRIVER_HAVE_IRQ makes no sense there.

Drop the flag for these drivers to avoid confusion.
