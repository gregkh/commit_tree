net: xgene: fix backward compatibility fix

A bugfix for backward compatibility handling introduced undefined
behavior for the case that of_parse_phandle() does not return
a valid entry, as "gcc -Wmaybe-unused" reports:

drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_hw.c: In function 'xgene_enet_phy_connect':
drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_hw.c:776:6: error: 'phy_dev' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_hw.c: In function 'xgene_enet_mdio_config':
drivers/net/ethernet/apm/xgene/xgene_enet_hw.c:776:6: error: 'phy_dev' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

We can work around this by removing the check for zero "np", as
of_phy_connect() will correctly handle a NULL argument so we fall
back into the normal error handling case.

Note that I had previously fixed another bug that resulted in the
exact same warning, but this is a different problem that was
introduced after my original fix.
