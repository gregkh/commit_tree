tty: amba-pl011: uart_amba_port is not available with earlycon function

Commit 0e125a5facf8 ("tty: amba-pl011: define flag register bits for ZTE
device") changes earlycon function pl011_putc() to use a pointer to
uart_amba_port.  This causes a regression when earlycon is enabled,
because uart_amba_port is not available yet at earlycon time.  Let's
revert the change on pl011_putc() to fix the regression.

The earlycon support for ZTE device can probably be added later by
declaring a new earlycon setup function with a vendor specific
compatible.
