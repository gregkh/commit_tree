powerpc/64s: Optimise MSR handling in exception handling

mtmsrd with L=1 only affects MSR_EE and MSR_RI bits, and we always
know what state those bits are, so the kernel MSR does not need to be
loaded when modifying them.

mtmsrd is often in the critical execution path, so avoiding dependency
on even L1 load is noticable. On a POWER8 this saves about 3 cycles
from the syscall path, and possibly a few from other exception returns
(not measured).
