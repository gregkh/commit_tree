power: supply: sbs-battery: simplify DT parsing

After the change to use the gpio descriptor interface, we get a warning if
-Wmaybe-uninitialized is added back to the build flags (it is currently
disabled:

drivers/power/supply/sbs-battery.c: In function 'sbs_probe':
drivers/power/supply/sbs-battery.c:760:28: error: 'pdata' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The problem is that if neither the DT properties nor a platform_data
pointer are provided, the chip->pdata pointer gets set to an uninitialized
value.

Looking at the code some more, I found that the sbs_of_populate_pdata
function is more complex than necessary and has confusing calling
conventions of possibly returning a valid pointer, a NULL pointer
or an ERR_PTR pointer (in addition to the uninitialized pointer).

To fix all of that, this gets rid of the chip->pdata pointer and
simply moves the two integers into the sbs_info structure. This
makes it much clearer from reading sbs_probe() what the precedence
of the three possible values are (pdata, DT, hardcoded defaults)
and completely avoids the #ifdef CONFIG_OF guards as
of_property_read_u32() gets replaced with a compile-time stub
when that is disabled, and returns an error if passed a NULL of_node
pointer.
