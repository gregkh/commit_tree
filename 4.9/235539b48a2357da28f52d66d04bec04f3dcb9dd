kvm: add stubs for arch specific debugfs support

Two stubs are added:

 o kvm_arch_has_vcpu_debugfs(): must return true if the arch
   supports creating debugfs entries in the vcpu debugfs dir
   (which will be implemented by the next commit)

 o kvm_arch_create_vcpu_debugfs(): code that creates debugfs
   entries in the vcpu debugfs dir

For x86, this commit introduces a new file to avoid growing
arch/x86/kvm/x86.c even more.
