net/ncsi: Allow to extend NCSI request properties

There is only one NCSI request property for now: the response for
the sent command need drive the workqueue or not. So we had one
field (@driven) for the purpose. We lost the flexibility to extend
NCSI request properties.

This replaces @driven with @flags and @req_flags in NCSI request
and NCSI command argument struct. Each bit of the newly introduced
field can be used for one property. No functional changes introduced.
