fscrypto: lock inode while setting encryption policy

i_rwsem needs to be acquired while setting an encryption policy so that
concurrent calls to FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY are correctly
serialized (especially the ->get_context() + ->set_context() pair), and
so that new files cannot be created in the directory during or after the
->empty_dir() check.
