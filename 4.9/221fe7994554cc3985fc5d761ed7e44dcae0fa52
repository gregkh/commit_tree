drm/i915: Perform a direct reset of the GPU from the waiter

If a waiter is holding the struct_mutex, then the reset worker cannot
reset the GPU until the waiter returns. We do not want to return -EAGAIN
form i915_wait_request as that breaks delicate operations like
i915_vma_unbind() which often cannot be restarted easily, and returning
-EIO is just as useless (and has in the past proven dangerous). The
remaining WARN_ON(i915_wait_request) serve as a valuable reminder that
handling errors from an indefinite wait are tricky.

We can keep the current semantic that knowing after a reset is complete,
so is the request, by performing the reset ourselves if we hold the
mutex.

uevent emission is still handled by the reset worker, so it may appear
slightly out of order with respect to the actual reset (and concurrent
use of the device).
