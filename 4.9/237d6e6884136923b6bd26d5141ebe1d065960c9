s390/hypfs: Use get_free_page() instead of kmalloc to ensure page alignment

Since commit d86bd1bece6f ("mm/slub: support left redzone") it is no longer
guaranteed that kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE) returns page aligned memory.

After the above commit we get an error for diag224 because aligned
memory is required. This leads to the following user visible error:

 # mount none -t s390_hypfs /sys/hypervisor/
 mount: unknown filesystem type 's390_hypfs'

 # dmesg | grep hypfs
 hypfs.cccfb8: The hardware system does not provide all functions
               required by hypfs
 hypfs.7a79f0: Initialization of hypfs failed with rc=-61

Fix this problem and use get_free_page() instead of kmalloc() to get
correctly aligned memory.
