drm/qxl: reapply cursor after SetCrtc calls

The qxl driver currently destroys and recreates the
qxl "primary" any time the first crtc is set.

A side-effect of destroying the primary is mouse state
associated with the crtc is lost, which leads to
disappearing mouse cursors on wayland sessions.

This commit changes the driver to reapply the cursor
any time SetCrtc is called. It achieves this by keeping
a reference to the cursor bo on the qxl_crtc struct.
