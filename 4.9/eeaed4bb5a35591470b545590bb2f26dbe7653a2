ACPI/PCI/IRQ: assign ISA IRQ directly during early boot stages

We do not want to store the SCI penalty in the acpi_isa_irq_penalty[]
table because acpi_isa_irq_penalty[] only holds ISA IRQ penalties and
there's no guarantee that the SCI is an ISA IRQ.  We add in the SCI
penalty as a special case in acpi_irq_get_penalty().

But if we called acpi_penalize_isa_irq() or acpi_irq_penalty_update()
for an SCI that happened to be an ISA IRQ, they stored the SCI
penalty (part of the acpi_irq_get_penalty() return value) in
acpi_isa_irq_penalty[].  Subsequent calls to acpi_irq_get_penalty()
returned a penalty that included *two* SCI penalties.
