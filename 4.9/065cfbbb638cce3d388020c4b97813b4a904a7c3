pwm: cros-ec: Add __packed to prevent padding

While the particular usage in question is likely safe (struct
cros_ec_command is 32-bit aligned, followed by <= 32-bit fields), it's
been suggested this is not a great pattern to follow for the general
case -- for example, if we follow a 'struct cros_ec_command' (which is
32-bit- but not 64-bit-aligned) with a struct that starts with a 64-bit
type (e.g., u64), the compiler may add padding.

Let's add __packed, to inform the compiler of our true intention -- to
have no padding between these struct elements -- and to future proof for
any refactorings that might occur.
