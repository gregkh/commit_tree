arch/tile: adopt the new nmi_backtrace framework

Previously tile was rolling its own method of capturing backtrace data
in the NMI handlers, but it was relying on running printk() from the NMI
handler, which is not always safe.  So adopt the nmi_backtrace model
(with the new cpumask extension) instead.

So we can call the nmi_backtrace code directly from the nmi handler,
move the nmi_enter()/exit() into the top-level tile NMI handler.

The semantics of the routine change slightly since it is now synchronous
with the remote cores completing the backtraces.  Previously it was
asynchronous, but with protection to avoid starting a new remote
backtrace if the old one was still in progress.
