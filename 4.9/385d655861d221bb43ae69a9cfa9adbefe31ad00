xfs: defer should allow ->finish_item to request a new transaction

When xfs_defer_finish calls ->finish_item, it's possible that
(refcount) won't be able to finish all the work in a single
transaction.  When this happens, the ->finish_item handler should
shorten the log done item's list count, update the work item to
reflect where work should continue, and return -EAGAIN so that
defer_finish knows to retain the pending item on the pending list,
roll the transaction, and restart processing where we left off.

Plumb in the code and document how this mechanism is supposed to work.
