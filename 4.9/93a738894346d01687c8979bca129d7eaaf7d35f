greybus: timesync: reduce initial startup time

Currently we have a long initial delay when initiating the first operation
to synchronize the FrameTime. That made sense during development of the
feature since we did synchronization asynchronously and wanted to give some
grace time for new Interfaces to be added before initiating a new
synchronization. On the PM runtime resume path though we do a synchronous
restoration of FrameTime and in this case waiting for 1 second before
initiating the first operation is clearly wrong.

This patch reduces the initial operation time bringing the synchronous call
time down by 990 milliseconds.
