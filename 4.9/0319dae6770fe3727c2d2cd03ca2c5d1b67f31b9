KVM: s390: split store status and machine check handling

Store status writes the prefix which is not to be done by a machine check.
Also, the psw is stored and later on overwritten by the failing-storage
address, which looks strange at first sight.

Store status and machine check handling look similar, but they are actually
two different things.
