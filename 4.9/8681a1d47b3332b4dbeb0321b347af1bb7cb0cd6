Fixes: 3d44a78f0d8b ("staging: rtl8712: Remove unnecessary 'else'")

An "unnecessary" 'else' was removed due to complains from checkpatch.pl
as it is preceded by a 'return', however the 'else' branch is necessary
as an earlier branch of the 'if' falls through. By removing the 'else',
that route now hits the 'break' and the 'while' loop exits prematurely.

This commit reverts that change and puts the original 'else' back in
place.
