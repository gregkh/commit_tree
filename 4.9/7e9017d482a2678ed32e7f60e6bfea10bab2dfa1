greybus: svc: Drop svc_set_route_send()

The responsibility of this routine is to configure ARA switch to
establish a connection between a cport on the AP and a cport on an
interface.

The SVC protocol is responsible for such requests and we already have
connection_{create|destroy}_operation() to take care of this.

Moreover, this request is not served by the firmware or gbsim today and
they just print a debug message on this request. And so it is safe to
drop svc_set_route_send() function and fix the required functionality of
configuring the switch in svc protocol driver later.
