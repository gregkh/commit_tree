fscrypto: don't use on-stack buffer for filename encryption

With the new (in 4.9) option to use a virtually-mapped stack
(CONFIG_VMAP_STACK), stack buffers cannot be used as input/output for
the scatterlist crypto API because they may not be directly mappable to
struct page.  For short filenames, fname_encrypt() was encrypting a
stack buffer holding the padded filename.  Fix it by encrypting the
filename in-place in the output buffer, thereby making the temporary
buffer unnecessary.

This bug could most easily be observed in a CONFIG_DEBUG_SG kernel
because this allowed the BUG in sg_set_buf() to be triggered.
