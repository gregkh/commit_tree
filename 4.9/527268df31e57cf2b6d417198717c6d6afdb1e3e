target: Re-add missing SCF_ACK_KREF assignment in v4.1.y

This patch fixes a regression in >= v4.1.y code where the original
SCF_ACK_KREF assignment in target_get_sess_cmd() was dropped upstream
in commit 054922bb, but the series for addressing TMR ABORT_TASK +
LUN_RESET with fabric session reinstatement in commit febe562c20 still
depends on this code in transport_cmd_finish_abort().

The regression manifests itself as a se_cmd->cmd_kref +1 leak, where
ABORT_TASK + LUN_RESET can hang indefinately for a specific I_T session
for drivers using SCF_ACK_KREF, resulting in hung kthreads.

This patch has been verified with v4.1.y code.
