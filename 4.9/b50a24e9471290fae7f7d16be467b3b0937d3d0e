greybus: svc: don't trust any struct devices

As the svc code is "odd" in how things are set up at initial connection
time, we can't always "know" that we have a valid bundle to use for
error messages.  So just punt and always use pr_*() calls to ensure that
we never incorrectly dereference a pointer.

This will get fixed up soon, but for now, let's just live with a bit
messier error messages in the log.
