net/sched: act_tunnel_key: Remove rcu_read_lock protection

Remove rcu_read_lock protection from tunnel_key_dump and use
rtnl_dereference, dump operation is protected by  rtnl lock.

Also, remove rcu_read_lock from tunnel_key_release and use
rcu_dereference_protected.

Both operations are running exclusively and a writer couldn't modify
t->params while those functions are executed.
