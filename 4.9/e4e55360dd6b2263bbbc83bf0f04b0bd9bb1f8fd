greybus: core: Rename greybus_module_match()

greybus_module_match() doesn't match modules anymore but bundle devices
and should be named correctly.

Though we can use greybus_bundle_match() as well, rest of the kernel
uses terminology like 'greybus_match_device' and so choosing that
instead.

Compile tested.
