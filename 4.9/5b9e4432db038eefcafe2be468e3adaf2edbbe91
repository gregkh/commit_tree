fm10k: use software values when checking for Tx hangs in hot path

A previous patch added support to check for hardware Tx pending in the
fm10k_down routine. This support was intended to ensure that we
accurately check what the hardware state is. However, checking for Tx
hangs in this manor during the hotpath results in a large performance
hit. Avoid this by making the hotpath check use the SW counters instead.
