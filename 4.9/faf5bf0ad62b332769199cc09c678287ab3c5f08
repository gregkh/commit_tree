drm/i915: Use atomics to manipulate obj->frontbuffer_bits

The individual bits inside obj->frontbuffer_bits are protected by each
plane->mutex, but the whole bitfield may be accessed by multiple KMS
operations simultaneously and so the RMW need to be under atomics.
However, for updating the single field we do not need to mandate that it
be under the struct_mutex, one more step towards its removal as the de
facto BKL.
