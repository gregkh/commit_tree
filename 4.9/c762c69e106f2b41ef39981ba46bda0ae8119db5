powerpc/boot: Add support for XZ compression

This patch adds an option to use XZ compression for the kernel image.

Currently this is only enabled for 64-bit Book3S targets, which is
roughly equivalent to the platforms that use the kernel's zImage
wrapper, and that have been tested.

The bulk of the 32-bit platforms and 64-bit BookE use uboot images,
which relies on uboot implementing XZ. In future we can enable XZ
support for those targets once someone has tested it.
