driver core: skip removal test for non-removable drivers

Some drivers do not support removal/unbinding. These drivers should have
drv->suppress_bind_attrs set to true, so use that to skip the removal
test.

This doesn't fix anything reported so far, but should prevent some other
cases. Some drivers will need fixes to set suppress_bind_attrs to avoid
this test.
