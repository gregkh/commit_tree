mlxsw: spectrum: Don't set learning when creating vPorts

Before commit 99724c18fc66 ("mlxsw: spectrum: Introduce support for
router interfaces") we used to assign vFIDs to the created vPorts. Since
these vPorts were used for slow path traffic we had to disable learning
for them, as it doesn't make sense to have it enabled.

This is no longer the case and now vPorts are either used for router
interfaces (for which learning is disabled by the firmware) or bridge
ports (for which learning is explicitly enabled by the driver).

Therefore, we can remove the learning configuration upon vPort creation.
