perf/core: Introduce PMU_EV_CAP_READ_ACTIVE_PKG

Introduce the flag PMU_EV_CAP_READ_ACTIVE_PKG, useful for uncore events,
that allows a PMU to signal the generic perf code that an event is readable
in the current CPU if the event is active in a CPU in the same package as
the current CPU.

This is an optimization that avoids a unnecessary IPI for the common case
where uncore events are run and read in the same package but in
different CPUs.

As an example, the IPI removal speeds up perf_read() in my Haswell system
as follows:

  - For event UNC_C_LLC_LOOKUP: From 260 us to 31 us.
  - For event RAPL's power/energy-cores/: From to 255 us to 27 us.

For the optimization to work, all events in the group must have it
(similarly to PERF_EV_CAP_SOFTWARE).
