greybus: interface: avoid I/O to bootrom during removal

Add an interface quirk flag to suppress I/O during interface disable.

This is needed to prevent I/O to the bootrom during controlled
connection tear down (e.g. eject or driver unbind). This will be more
obvious with the new connection tear-down procedure.
