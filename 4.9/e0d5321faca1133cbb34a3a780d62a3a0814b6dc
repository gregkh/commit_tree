arc: perf: Enable generic "cache-references" and "cache-misses" events

We used to live with PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_REFERENCES and
PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_REFERENCES not specified on ARC.

Those events are actually aliases to 2 cache events that we do support
and so this change sets "cache-reference" and "cache-misses" events
in the same way as "L1-dcache-loads" and L1-dcache-load-misses.

And while at it adding debug info for cache events as well as doing a
subtle fix in HW events debug info - config value is much better
represented by hex so we may see not only event index but as well other
control bits set (if they exist).
