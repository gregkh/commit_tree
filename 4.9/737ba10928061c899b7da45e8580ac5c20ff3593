drm/udl: implement usb_driver suspend/resume.

The usb_driver suspend and resume function pointers must be populated
to prevent forced unbinding of USB interface driver. See usb/core/driver.c:
unbind_no_pm_drivers_interfaces().

Restore mode and damage the entire frame buffer upon resume.

TEST=suspend and resume with the same UDL device connected
TEST=suspend with UDL, unplug UDL and resume
TEST=suspend with UDL, unplug and connect another UDL device then resume
