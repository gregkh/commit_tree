percpu_ref: reorganize __percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic() and relocate percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic()

Reorganize __percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic() so that it looks
structurally similar to __percpu_ref_switch_to_percpu() and relocate
percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic so that the two internal functions are
co-located.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional differences.
