greybus: arche-platform: Put APB in reset if of_platform_populate() fails

The current implementation around of_platform_populate() is not so
great. On error, we first print an error message, followed by a success
message and finally we return an error.

And over that we don't undo what we did initially.

This patch puts the APB back into reset and create a separate error
path to make things clear.
