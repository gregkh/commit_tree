drm: Extract drm_plane.[hc]

Just pure code movement, cleanup and polish will happen in later
patches.

v2: Don't forget all the ioctl! To extract those cleanly I decided to
put check_src_coords into drm_framebuffer.c (and give it a
drm_framebuffer_ prefix), since that just checks framebuffer
constraints.

v3: rebase over PAGE_FLIP_TARGET.

    drm: Reject page_flip for !DRIVER_MODESET

so as a result of moving the page_flip ioctl, this fix has
