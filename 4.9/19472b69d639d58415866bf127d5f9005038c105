selinux: Implementation for inode_copy_up_xattr() hook

When a file is copied up in overlay, we have already created file on
upper/ with right label and there is no need to copy up selinux
label/xattr from lower file to upper file. In fact in case of context
mount, we don't want to copy up label as newly created file got its label
from context= option.
