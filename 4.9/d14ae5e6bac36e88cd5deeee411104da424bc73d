irqchip/gicv3-its: Cleanup for ITS domain initialization

There is no point to initialize ITS without having msi-controller
property in corresponding DT node. However, its_probe is checking
msi-controller presence at the end, so we can save our time and do that
check prior to its_probe call. Also, for the code clarity purpose,
we put domain initialization to separate function.
