misc/genwqe: ensure zero initialization

Genwqe uses dma_alloc_coherent and depends on zero initialized memory. On
one occasion it ueses an explicit memset on others it uses un-initialized
memory.

This bug was covered because some archs actually return zero initialized
memory when using dma_alloc_coherent but this is by no means guaranteed.
Simply switch to dma_zalloc_coherent.
