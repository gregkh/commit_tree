Input: ALPS - handle 0-pressure 1F events

While a button is held SS5 hardware will give us single-finger packets
with x, y, and pressure equal to zero. This causes annoying jumps in
pointer position if a touch is released while the button is held. Handle
this by claiming zero contacts to ensure that no position events are
provided to the user.
