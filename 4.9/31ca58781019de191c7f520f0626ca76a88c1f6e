ceph: fix uninitialized dentry pointer in ceph_real_mount()

    fs/ceph/super.c: In function ‘ceph_real_mount’:
    fs/ceph/super.c:818: warning: ‘root’ may be used uninitialized in this function

If s_root is already valid, dentry pointer root is never initialized,
and returned by ceph_real_mount(). This will cause a crash later when
the caller dereferences the pointer.
