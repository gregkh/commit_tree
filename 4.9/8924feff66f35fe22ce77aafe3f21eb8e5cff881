splice: lift pipe_lock out of splice_to_pipe()

* splice_to_pipe() stops at pipe overflow and does *not* take pipe_lock
* ->splice_read() instances do the same
* vmsplice_to_pipe() and do_splice() (ultimate callers of splice_to_pipe())
  arrange for waiting, looping, etc. themselves.

That should make pipe_lock the outermost one.

Unfortunately, existing rules for the amount passed by vmsplice_to_pipe()
and do_splice() are quite ugly _and_ userland code can be easily broken
by changing those.  It's not even "no more than the maximal capacity of
this pipe" - it's "once we'd fed pipe->nr_buffers pages into the pipe,
leave instead of waiting".

Considering how poorly these rules are documented, let's try "wait for some
space to appear, unless given SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK, then push into pipe
and if we run into overflow, we are done".
