staging: rtl8188eu: remove unused debugging functions

These functions were only mentioned in the rtw_proc_init_one()
function in drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/os_dep/os_intfs.c, which was
under #if 0 and has now been removed completely.

As they are not used anywhere, and also violate the coding style
rules, remove them.
