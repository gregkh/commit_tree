drm/sun4i: dotclock: Round to closest clock rate

With display pixel clocks we want to have the closest possible clock
rate, to minimize timing and refresh rate skews. Whether the actual
clock rate is higher or lower than the requested rate is less important.

Also check candidates against the requested rate, rather than the
ideal parent rate, the varying dividers also influence the difference
between the requested rate and the rounded rate.
