objtool: Skip all "unreachable instruction" warnings for gcov kernels

Recently objtool has started reporting a few "unreachable instruction"
warnings when CONFIG_GCOV is enabled for newer versions of GCC.  Usually
this warning means there's some new control flow that objtool doesn't
understand.  But in this case, objtool is correct and the instructions
really are inaccessible.  It's an annoying quirk of gcov, but it's
harmless, so it's ok to just silence the warnings.

With older versions of GCC, it was relatively easy to detect
gcov-specific instructions and to skip any unreachable warnings produced
by them.  But GCC 6 has gotten craftier.

Instead of continuing to play whack-a-mole with gcov, just use a bigger,
more permanent hammer and disable unreachable warnings for the whole
file when gcov is enabled.  This is fine to do because a) unreachable
warnings are usually of questionable value; and b) gcov isn't used for
production kernels and we can relax the checks a bit there.
