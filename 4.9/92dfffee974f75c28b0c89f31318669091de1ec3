s390: pci: don't print uninitialized data for debugging

gcc correctly warns about an incorrect use of the 'pa' variable in case
we pass an empty scatterlist to __s390_dma_map_sg:

  arch/s390/pci/pci_dma.c: In function '__s390_dma_map_sg':
  arch/s390/pci/pci_dma.c:309:13: warning: 'pa' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

This adds a bogus initialization to the function to sanitize the debug
output.  I would have preferred a solution without the initialization,
but I only got the report from the kbuild bot after turning on the
warning again, and didn't manage to reproduce it myself.
