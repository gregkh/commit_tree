ARM: 8605/1: V7M: fix notrace variant of save_and_disable_irqs

Commit 8e43a905 "ARM: 7325/1: fix v7 boot with lockdep enabled"
introduced notrace variant of save_and_disable_irqs to balance notrace
variant of restore_irqs; however V7M case has been missed. It was not
noticed because cache-v7.S the only place where notrace variant is used.
So fix it, since we are going to extend V7 cache routines to handle V7M
case too.
