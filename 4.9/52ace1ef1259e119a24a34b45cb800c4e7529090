fs/cifs: reopen persistent handles on reconnect

Continuous Availability features like persistent handles
require that clients reconnect their open files, not
just the sessions, soon after the network connection comes
back up, otherwise the server will throw away the state
(byte range locks, leases, deny modes) on those handles
after a timeout.

Add code to reconnect handles when use_persistent set
(e.g. Continuous Availability shares) after tree reconnect.
