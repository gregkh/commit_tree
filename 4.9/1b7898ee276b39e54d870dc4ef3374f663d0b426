powerpc/boot: Use the pre-boot decompression API

Currently the powerpc boot wrapper has its own wrapper around zlib to
handle decompressing gzipped kernels. The kernel decompressor library
functions now provide a generic interface that can be used in the
pre-boot environment. This allows boot wrappers to easily support
different compression algorithms. This patch converts the wrapper to use
this new API, but does not add support for using new algorithms.
