greybus: legacy: remove unimplemented classes from id table

Remove the unimplemented display, sensor, and svc classes from the
device-id table.

As Viresh noted the SVC protocol is special and having an SVC class
doesn't really make sense at all. Either way, the SVC protocol is
already implemented by core.

Testing Done: Compiled
