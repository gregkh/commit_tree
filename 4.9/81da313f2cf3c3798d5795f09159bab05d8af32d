xtensa: add default memmap option to iss_defconfig

Now that memory initialization doesn't add default memory region specify
it explicitly in the memmap command line option.

Save iss_defconfig as defconfig so that it doesn't have all option
settings in it, only those that are different from the Kconfig defaults.
