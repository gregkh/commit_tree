rbd: use kmalloc_array() in rbd_header_from_disk()

* A multiplication for the size determination of a memory allocation
  indicated that an array data structure should be processed.
  Thus use the corresponding function "kmalloc_array".

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* Delete the local variable "size" which became unnecessary with
  this refactoring.
