drm/i915: Introduce i915_ggtt_offset()

This little helper only exists to safely discard the upper unused 32bits
of the general 64-bit VMA address - as we know that all Global GTT
currently are less than 4GiB in size and so that the upper bits must be
zero. In many places, we use a u32 for the global GTT offset and we want
to document where we are discarding the full VMA offset.
