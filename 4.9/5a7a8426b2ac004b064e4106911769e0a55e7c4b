arm64: KVM: Use static keys for selecting the GIC backend

Currently GIC backend is selected via alternative framework and this
is fine. We are going to introduce vgic-v3 to 32-bit world and there
we don't have patching framework in hand, so we can either check
support for GICv3 every time we need to choose which backend to use or
try to optimise it by using static keys. The later looks quite
promising because we can share logic involved in selecting GIC backend
between architectures if both uses static keys.

This patch moves arm64 from alternative to static keys framework for
selecting GIC backend. For that we embed static key into vgic_global
and enable the key during vgic initialisation based on what has
already been exposed by the host GIC driver.
