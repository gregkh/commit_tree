IB/hfi1: Increase default settings of max_cqes and max_qps

The ib_write_bw test allows using up to 16384 QPs. When a relatively
large number of QPs (within that range) is used, the test can fail
because the number of CQ entries needed exceeds the limit set by the
driver.

This patch increases the default setting of max_cqes from 0x2FFFF
(196607) to 0x2FFFFF(3145727), which is sufficient to cover the
maximum number needed by the ib_write_bw test (2097152). The default
setting of max_qps is also increased from 16384 to 32768 to allow
the test to run successfully with 16383 or 16384 QPs.
