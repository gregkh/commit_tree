CIFS: Retrieve uid and gid from special sid if enabled

New mount option "idsfromsid" indicates to cifs.ko that
it should try to retrieve the uid and gid owner fields
from special sids.  This patch adds the code to parse the owner
sids in the ACL to see if they match, and if so populate the
uid and/or gid from them.  This is faster than upcalling for
them and asking winbind, and is a fairly common case, and is
also helpful when cifs.upcall and idmapping is not configured.
