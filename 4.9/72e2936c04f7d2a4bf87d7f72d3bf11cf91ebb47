mm: remove unnecessary condition in remove_inode_hugepages

When the huge page is added to the page cahce (huge_add_to_page_cache),
the page private flag will be cleared.  since this code
(remove_inode_hugepages) will only be called for pages in the page
cahce, PagePrivate(page) will always be false.

The patch remove the code without any functional change.
