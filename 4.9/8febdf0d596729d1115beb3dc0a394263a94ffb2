drm/doc: Reorg drm-mm.rst

- Readjust headings - we lost one level through the extraction into a
  separate .rst file.
- Merge helper reference sections with the helper documentation - that
  split was just an artifact of the docbook toolchain sucking at too
  deep nesting levels. No such problems with sphinx.
- Move the cma helpers in with the gem documentation, since they're
  helpers to implement gem using CMA/dma memory as a backend.
