dt-bindings: i2c: add support for 'i2c-gate' subnode

Handle i2c gates similarly to how i2c arbitrators are handled.
This gets rid of a pointless 'reg' property for i2c gates.

I.e. this new and more compact style

        some-gate {
                i2c-gate {
                        #address-cells = <1>;
                        #size-cells = <0>;

                        some-i2c-device@50 {
                                reg = <0x50>;
                        };
                };
        };

instead of the old

        some-gate {
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;

                i2c@0 {
                        reg = <0>;

                        #address-cells = <1>;
                        #size-cells = <0>;

                        some-i2c-device@50 {
                                reg = <0x50>;
                        };
                };
        };
