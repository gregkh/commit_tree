ARM: omap3: Add missing memory node in SOM-LV

The skeleton.dtsi file was removed in ARM64 for different reasons as
explained in commit ("3ebee5a2e141 arm64: dts: kill skeleton.dtsi").

commit ("766a1fe78fc3 ARM: omap3: Add missing memory node") had
fixes for Torpedo and Overo boards, but this SOM-LV was missed.

This should help prevent the DTC warning:
"Node /memory has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name"
