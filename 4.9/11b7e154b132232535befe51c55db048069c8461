powerpc/nvram: Fix an incorrect partition merge

When we merge two contiguous partitions whose signatures are marked
NVRAM_SIG_FREE, We need update prev's length and checksum, then write it
to nvram, not cur's. So lets fix this mistake now.

Also use memset instead of strncpy to set the partition's name. It's
more readable if we want to fill up with duplicate chars .
