staging: lustre: uapi: reduce scope of lustre_idl.h

Move the definition of OBD_OCD_VERSION() and similar macros from
lustre_idl.h to lustre_ver.h. These macros are primarily used in
comparisons to LUSTRE_VERSION_CODE which is defined in lustre_ver.h
and so should be defined there as well. Move a few definitions
(related to FIDs, quota and striping) from lustre_idl.h to
lustre_user.h.
