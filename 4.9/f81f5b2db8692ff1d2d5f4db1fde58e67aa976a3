Bluetooth: Send control open and close messages for HCI raw sockets

When opening and closing HCI raw sockets their main usage is for legacy
userspace. To track interaction with the modern mgmt interface, send
open and close monitoring messages for these action.

The HCI raw sockets is special since it supports unbound ioctl operation
and for that special case delay the notification message until at least
one ioctl has been executed. The difference between a bound and unbound
socket will be detailed by the fact the HCI index is present or not.
