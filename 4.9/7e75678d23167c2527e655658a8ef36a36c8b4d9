pstore/ram: Use memcpy_toio instead of memcpy

persistent_ram_update uses vmap / iomap based on whether the buffer is in
memory region or reserved region. However, both map it as non-cacheable
memory. For armv8 specifically, non-cacheable mapping requests use a
memory type that has to be accessed aligned to the request size. memcpy()
doesn't guarantee that.
