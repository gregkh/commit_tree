drm/i915: Mark up all locked waiters

In the next patch we want to handle reset directly by a locked waiter in
order to avoid issues with returning before the reset is handled. To
handle the reset, we must first know whether we hold the struct_mutex.
If we do not hold the struct_mtuex we can not perform the reset, but we do
not block the reset worker either (and so we can just continue to wait for
request completion) - otherwise we must relinquish the mutex.
