drm/i915: Initialize legacy semaphores from engine hw id indexed array

Build the legacy semaphore initialisation array using the engine
hardware ids instead of driver internal ones. This makes the
static array size dependent only on the number of gen6 semaphore
engines.

Also makes the per-engine semaphore wait and signal tables
hardware id indexed saving some more space.

v2: Refactor I915_GEN6_NUM_ENGINES to GEN6_SEMAPHORE_LAST. (Chris Wilson)
v3: More polish. (Chris Wilson)
