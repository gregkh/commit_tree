PM / Domains: Simplify detaching a device from its genpd

There's no need to validate the PM domain by using genpd_lookup_dev() when
removing the device via genpd's genpd_dev_pm_detach() function. That's
because this function can't be called, unless there is a valid PM domain
for the device.

To simplify the behaviour, let's move code from pm_genpd_remove_device()
into a new internal function, genpd_remove_device(), which is called from
pm_genpd_remove_device() and genpd_dev_pm_detach().
