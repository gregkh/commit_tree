greybus: bundle: kill the bundle lock

Kill the bundle lock, which looked like it protected the interface
bundle lists but really did not as lock-less manipulations were still
made.

No locking for the interface bundle list is in fact needed as bundles
are created along with the interface, and the list is only used to check
for duplicate bundle ids when parsing the manifest and to destroy the
bundles when removing the interface itself.
