ASoC: da7219: Disable AAD if codec is not a wake-up source

Currently if AAD is enabled in the device, during system suspend
the feature remains, regardless of whether the codec is a wake-up
source or not. This means some additional power is being used
which is unnecessary, and can causes issues with some platforms'
IRQ handlers where state changes during system suspend aren't
captured.

This patch updates the driver to disable AAD during suspend, if
we're not a wake-up source, and then re-enables this on resume.
