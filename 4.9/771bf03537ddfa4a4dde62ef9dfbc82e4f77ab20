zfcp: fix D_ID field with actual value on tracing SAN responses

With commit 2c55b750a884b86dea8b4cc5f15e1484cc47a25c
("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug tracing for SAN records.")
we lost the N_Port-ID where an ELS response comes from.
With commit 7c7dc196814b9e1d5cc254dc579a5fa78ae524f7
("[SCSI] zfcp: Simplify handling of ct and els requests")
we lost the N_Port-ID where a CT response comes from.
It's especially useful if the request SAN trace record
with D_ID was already lost due to trace buffer wrap.

GS uses an open WKA port handle and ELS just a D_ID, and
only for ELS we could get D_ID from QTCB bottom via zfcp_fsf_req.
To cover both cases, add a new field to zfcp_fsf_ct_els
and fill it in on request to use in SAN response trace.
Strictly speaking the D_ID on SAN response is the FC frame's S_ID.
We don't need a field for the other end which is always us.
