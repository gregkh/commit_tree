ASoC: simple-card: use kzalloc() for dai_props / dai_link

simple sound card family are using very similar style, but because of its
historical reason, there are small differences. For example pointer style,
function name, caller postion etc...
This patch synchronized simple card style to other simple card family.

Now, simple card needs to 2 type of buffer for dai_props and dai_link.
But, these used different style for buffer allocation.
This patch make these same style as other simple card family.
(= use kzalloc() for both)
