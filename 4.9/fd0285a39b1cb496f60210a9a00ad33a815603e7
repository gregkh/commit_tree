fib_trie: Correct /proc/net/route off by one error

The display of /proc/net/route has had a couple issues due to the fact that
when I originally rewrote most of fib_trie I made it so that the iterator
was tracking the next value to use instead of the current.

In addition it had an off by 1 error where I was tracking the first piece
of data as position 0, even though in reality that belonged to the
SEQ_START_TOKEN.

This patch updates the code so the iterator tracks the last reported
position and key instead of the next expected position and key.  In
addition it shifts things so that all of the leaves start at 1 instead of
trying to report leaves starting with offset 0 as being valid.  With these
two issues addressed this should resolve any off by one errors that were
present in the display of /proc/net/route.
