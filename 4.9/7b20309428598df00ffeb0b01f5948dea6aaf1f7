libata: Add support for SCT Write Same

SATA drives may support write same via SCT. This is useful
for setting the drive contents to a specific pattern (0's).

Translate a SCSI WRITE SAME 16 command to be either a DSM TRIM
command or an SCT Write Same command.

Based on the UNMAP flag:
  - When set translate to DSM TRIM
  - When not set translate to SCT Write Same
