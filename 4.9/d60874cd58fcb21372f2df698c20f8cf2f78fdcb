vfs: add vfs_get_link() helper

This helper is for filesystems that want to read the symlink and are better
off with the get_link() interface (returning a char *) rather than the
readlink() interface (copy into a userspace buffer).

Also call the LSM hook for readlink (not get_link) since this is for
symlink reading not following.
