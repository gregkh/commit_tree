dm mpath: check if path's request_queue is dying in activate_path()

If pg_init_retries is set and a request is queued against a multipath
device with all underlying block device request_queues in the "dying"
state then an infinite loop is triggered because activate_path() never
succeeds and hence never calls pg_init_done().

This change avoids that device removal triggers an infinite loop by
failing the activate_path() which causes the "dying" path to be failed.
