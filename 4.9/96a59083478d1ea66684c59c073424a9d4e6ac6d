kcm: Remove TCP specific references from kcm and strparser

kcm and strparser need to work with any type of stream socket not just
TCP. Eliminate references to TCP and call generic proto_ops functions of
read_sock and peek_len. Also in strp_init check if the socket support
the proto_ops read_sock and peek_len.
