iwlwifi: mvm: comply with fw_restart mod param on suspend

If the suspend flow fails, we restart the hardware to go back to
the D0 image (with non-unified images), but we don't comply with
the fw_restart module parameter.  If something goes wrong when
starting the D3 image, we may want to debug it, so we should
comply with the fw_restart flag to avoid clearing everything up
and losing the firmware state when the error occurred.
