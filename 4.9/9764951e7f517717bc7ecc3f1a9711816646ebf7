drm/i915: Pin the pages first in shmem prepare read/write

There is an improbable, but not impossible, case that if we leave the
pages unpin as we operate on the object, then somebody via the shrinker
may steal the lock (which lock? right now, it is struct_mutex, THE lock)
and change the cache domains after we have already inspected them.

(Whilst here, avail ourselves of the opportunity to take a couple of
steps to make the two functions look more similar.)
