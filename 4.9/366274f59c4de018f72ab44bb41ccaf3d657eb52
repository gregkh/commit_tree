KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Update irq stats for IRQs handled in real mode

When a passthrough IRQ is handled completely within KVM real
mode code, it has to also update the IRQ stats since this
does not go through the generic IRQ handling code.

However, the per CPU kstat_irqs field is an allocated (not static)
field and so cannot be directly accessed in real mode safely.

The function this_cpu_inc_rm() is introduced to safely increment
per CPU fields (currently coded for unsigned integers only) that
are allocated and could thus be vmalloced also.
