KVM: PPC: Book3s PR: Allow access to unprivileged MMCR2 register

The MMCR2 register is available twice, one time with number 785
(privileged access), and one time with number 769 (unprivileged,
but it can be disabled completely). In former times, the Linux
kernel was using the unprivileged register 769 only, but since
commit 8dd75ccb571f3c92c ("powerpc: Use privileged SPR number
for MMCR2"), it uses the privileged register 785 instead.
The KVM-PR code then of course also switched to use the SPR 785,
but this is causing older guest kernels to crash, since these
kernels still access 769 instead. So to support older kernels
with KVM-PR again, we have to support register 769 in KVM-PR, too.
