greybus: arche-apb: Do cleanup within apb_ctrl_init_seq() for error cases

Relying on apb_ctrl_cleanup() to do the cleanup for errors that occurred
within apb_ctrl_init_seq() isn't a very clean idea. Handle that
separately within apb_ctrl_init_seq().

This will clean apb_ctrl_cleanup() in later patches.
