PCI: Avoid unnecessary resume after direct-complete

Commit 58a1fbbb2ee8 ("PM / PCI / ACPI: Kick devices that might have been
reset by firmware") added a runtime resume for devices that were runtime
suspended when the system entered sleep.

The motivation was that devices might be in a reset-power-on state after
waking from system sleep, so their power state as perceived by Linux
(stored in pci_dev->current_state) would no longer reflect reality.  By
resuming such devices, we allow them to return to a low-power state via
autosuspend and also bring their current_state in sync with reality.

However for devices that are *not* in a reset-power-on state, doing an
unconditional resume wastes energy.  A more refined approach is called for
which issues a runtime resume only if the power state after direct-complete
is shallower than it was before. To achieve this, update the device's
current_state and compare it to its pre-sleep value.
