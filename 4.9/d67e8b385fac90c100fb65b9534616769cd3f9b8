scsi: move function declarations to scsi_priv.h

We get 2 warnings about global functions without a declaration in the
scsi driver when building with W=1:

drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:467:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'scsi_requeue_run_queue' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:2609:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'scsi_evt_thread' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, both functions are declared in drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c but
need to move them into scsi_priv.h.
