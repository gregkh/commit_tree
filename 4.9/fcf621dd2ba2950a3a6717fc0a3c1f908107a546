IB/mlx4/mcg: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

alloc_ordered_workqueue() with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set, replaces
deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue(). This is the identity
conversion.

The workqueue "mcg_wq" queues work items &group->work
and &group->timeout_work.

The workqueue "clean_wq" queues work item mcg_clean_task.

Both have been identity converted.

WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under
memory pressure.
