perf/x86/intel/pt: Add support for PTWRITE and power event tracing

The Intel PT facility grew some new functionality:

  * PTWRITE packet carries the payload of the new PTWRITE instruction
    that can be used to instrument Intel PT traces with user-supplied
    data. Packets of this type are only generated if 'ptwrite' capability
    is set and PTWEn bit is set in the event attribute's config. Flow
    update packets (FUP) can be generated on PTWRITE packets if FUPonPTW
    config bit is set. Setting these bits is not allowed if 'ptwrite'
    capability is not set.

  * PWRE, PWRX, MWAIT, EXSTOP packets communicate core power management
    events. These depend on 'power_event_tracing' capability and are
    enabled by setting PwrEvtEn bit in the event attribute.

Extend the driver capabilities and provide the proper sanity checks in the
event validation function.
