x86: separate extable.h, switch sections.h to it

drivers/platform/x86/dell-smo8800.c is touched due to the following obscenity:
drivers/platform/x86/dell-smo8800.c ->
	linux/interrupt.h ->
		linux/hardirq.h ->
			asm/hardirq.h ->
				linux/irq.h ->
					asm/hw_irq.h ->
						asm/sections.h ->
							asm/uaccess.h
is the only chain of includes pulling asm/uaccess.h there.
