staging: lustre: lmv: Match MDT where the FID locates first

With DNE every object can have two locks in different namespaces:
lookup lock in space of MDT storing direntry and update/open lock
in space of MDT storing inode. In lmv_find_cbdata/lmv_lock_lock,
it should try the MDT that the FID maps to first, since this can
be easily found, and only try others if that fails.

In the error handler of lmv_add_targets, it should check whether
ld_tgt_count is being increased before ld_tgt_count is being -1.
