drm/doc: Polish kerneldoc for encoders

- Move missing bits into struct drm_encoder docs.
- Explain that encoders are 95% internal and only 5% uapi, and that in
  general the uapi part is broken.
- Remove verbose comments for functions not exposed to drivers.

v2: Review from Archit:
- Appease checkpatch in the moved code.
- Make it clearer that bridges are not exposed to userspace.
