greybus: minor tweak in gb_connection_recv_response()

Any time we queue work on the operation work queue we need to have
set the operation errno first.

This patch moves the assignment of that field to be immediately
prior to the queue_work() call in gb_connection_recv_response(),
so it is easier to see at a glance that this has been done.
