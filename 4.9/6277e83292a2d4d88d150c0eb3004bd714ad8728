ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Parse vendor tokens to build module data

Skl topology data is preceded by a descriptor for number of data
blocks, the size of the data block and type of data block. The
type of the data block can be either a tuple or a binary blob.

Private data is parsed based on data block type and module data
is filled accordingly.
