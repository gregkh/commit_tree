fs/ocfs2/dlm: remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue()

The workqueue "dlm_worker" queues a single work item &dlm->dispatched_work
and thus it doesn't require execution ordering.  Hence, alloc_workqueue
has been used to replace the deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue
instance.

The WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag has been set to ensure forward progress under
memory pressure.

Since there are fixed number of work items, explicit concurrency
limit is unnecessary here.
