ACPI / EC: Fix an issue that SCI_EVT cannot be detected after event is enabled

After enabling the EC event handling, Linux is still in the noirq stage, if
there is no triggering source (EC transaction, GPE STS status),
advance_transaction() will not be invoked and SCI_EVT cannot be detected.
This patch adds one more triggering source after enabling the EC event
handling to poll the pending SCI_EVT.

Known issues:
1. Still no SCI_EVT triggering source
   There could still be no SCI_EVT triggering source after handling the
   first SCI_EVT (polled by this patch if any). Because after handling the
   first SCI_EVT, Linux could still be in noirq stage and there could still
   be no further triggering source in this stage. Then the second SCI_EVT
   indicated during this stage still cannot be detected by the EC driver.
   With this improvement applied, it is then possible to move
   acpi_ec_enable_event() out of the noirq stage to fix this issue (if the
   first SCI_EVT is handled out of the noirq stage, the follow-up SCI_EVTs
   should be able to trigger IRQs).
