iommu/dma: Add support for mapping MSIs

When an MSI doorbell is located downstream of an IOMMU, attaching
devices to a DMA ops domain and switching on translation leads to a rude
shock when their attempt to write to the physical address returned by
the irqchip driver faults (or worse, writes into some already-mapped
buffer) and no interrupt is forthcoming.

Address this by adding a hook for relevant irqchip drivers to call from
their compose_msi_msg() callback, to swizzle the physical address with
an appropriatly-mapped IOVA for any device attached to one of our DMA
ops domains.
