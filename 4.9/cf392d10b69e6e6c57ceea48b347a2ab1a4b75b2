cpu/hotplug: Add multi instance support

This patch adds the ability for a given state to have multiple
instances. Until now all states have a single instance and the startup /
teardown callback use global variables.
A few drivers need to perform a the same callbacks on multiple
"instances". Currently we have three drivers in tree which all have a
global list which they iterate over. With multi instance they support
don't need their private list and the functionality has been moved into
core code. Plus we hold the hotplug lock in core so no cpus comes/goes
while instances are registered and we do rollback in error case :)
