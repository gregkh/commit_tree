fs/afs/callback: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

The workqueue "afs_callback_update_worker" queues multiple work items
viz  &vnode->cb_broken_work, &server->cb_break_work which require strict
execution ordering. Hence, an ordered dedicated workqueue has been used.

Since the workqueue is being used on a memory reclaim path, WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
has been set to ensure forward progress under memory pressure.
