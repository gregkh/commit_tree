net: diag: allow socket bytecode filters to match socket marks

This allows a privileged process to filter by socket mark when
dumping sockets via INET_DIAG_BY_FAMILY. This is useful on
systems that use mark-based routing such as Android.

The ability to filter socket marks requires CAP_NET_ADMIN, which
is consistent with other privileged operations allowed by the
SOCK_DIAG interface such as the ability to destroy sockets and
the ability to inspect BPF filters attached to packet sockets.
