ARC: Enable PERF_EVENTS in nSIM driven platforms

Now when we have properly working performance counters in nSIM
even with interrupt support (fix should be a part of upcoming
nSIM engineering build 2016.12-005) we may enable perf support
by default for all platforms that use nSIM for ARC cores simulation.

Note 1: PCT node was missing for some reason in nsimosci.dts
        while all other nSIM-related .dts files already had
        PCT node for quite some time, so adding it now.

Note 2: All defconfigs were regenerated with "make savedefconfig"
        which led to some clean-ups in nsimosci_hs_smp_defconfig:
        CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y was removed because it is
        automatically selected now by DRM.
