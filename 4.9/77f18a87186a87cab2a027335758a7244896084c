scsi: NCR5380: no longer mark irq probing as __init

The g_NCR5380 has been converted to more regular probing, which
means its probe function can now be invoked after the __init section
is discarded, as pointed out by this kbuild warning:

WARNING: drivers/scsi/built-in.o(.text+0x3a105): Section mismatch in reference from the function generic_NCR5380_isa_match() to the function .init.text:probe_intr()
WARNING: drivers/scsi/built-in.o(.text+0x3a145): Section mismatch in reference from the function generic_NCR5380_isa_match() to the variable .init.data:probe_irq

To make sure this works correctly in all cases, let's remove
the __init and __initdata annotations.
