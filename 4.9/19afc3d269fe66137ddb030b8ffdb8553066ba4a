irqchip: i8259: Allow platforms to override poll function

The default i8259 polling function (i8259_irq) is nicely generic but is
fairly costly. Platforms often provide an alternative means of polling
for an i8259 interrupt, and when using the i8259 without device tree
have typically just chained its parent interrupt to their own handler
function. In order to allow for platform-specific polling functions to
be used in cases where the driver is probed via device tree, provide an
i8259_set_poll function that accepts a pointer to an alternative poll
function that will override the default.
