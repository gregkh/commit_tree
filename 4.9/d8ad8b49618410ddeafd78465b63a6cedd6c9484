security, overlayfs: provide copy up security hook for unioned files

Provide a security hook to label new file correctly when a file is copied
up from lower layer to upper layer of a overlay/union mount.

This hook can prepare a new set of creds which are suitable for new file
creation during copy up. Caller will use new creds to create file and then
revert back to old creds and release new creds.
