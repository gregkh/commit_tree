blk-mq: abstract tag allocation out into sbitmap library

This is a generally useful data structure, so make it available to
anyone else who might want to use it. It's also a nice cleanup
separating the allocation logic from the rest of the tag handling logic.

The code is behind a new Kconfig option, CONFIG_SBITMAP, which is only
selected by CONFIG_BLOCK for now.

This should be a complete noop functionality-wise.
