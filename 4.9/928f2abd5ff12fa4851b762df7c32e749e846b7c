greybus: Tear down devices in the reverse order

Normally, its a good practice to free resources in the reverse order in
which they are allocated, so that all the dependencies can be sorted out
properly.

This is true while creating/destroying devices as well. For example
consider this scenario (I faced a crash with control protocol due to
this). For a new module, we will first create a bundle+connection for
the control cport and then create other bundles/connections after
parsing manifest.

And while destroying interface on module hot unplug, we are removing the
devices in the order they are added. And so the bundle/connection for
the control cport are destroyed first. But, control cport was still
required while destroying other bundles/connections.

To solve this problem, lets destroy the resources in the reverse order
in which they are added.
