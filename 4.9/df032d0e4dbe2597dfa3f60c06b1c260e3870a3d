scsi: hisi_sas: add v2 hw slot complete internal abort support

Add code in slot_complete_v2_hw() to deal with the slots which have
completed due to internal abort.

The status codes have the following meaning:

- STAT_IO_ABORTED: the IO has been aborted due to internal abort,
  whether by device or individual abort command

- STAT_IO_COMPLETE: internal abort command has completed successfully
  for device or individual abort command

- STAT_IO_NO_DEVICE: internal abort command has completed for device but
  cannot find any IO

- STAT_IO_NOT_VALID: internal abort command has completed for single
  command but could not find the command
