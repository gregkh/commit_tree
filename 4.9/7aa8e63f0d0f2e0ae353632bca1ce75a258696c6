ipv6: properly prevent temp_prefered_lft sysctl race

The check for an underflow of tmp_prefered_lft is always false
because tmp_prefered_lft is unsigned. The intention of the check
was to guard against racing with an update of the
temp_prefered_lft sysctl, potentially resulting in an underflow.

As suggested by David Miller, the best way to prevent the race is
by reading the sysctl variable using READ_ONCE.
