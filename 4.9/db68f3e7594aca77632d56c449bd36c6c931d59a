arm64: tlbflush.h: add __tlbi() macro

As with dsb() and isb(), add a __tlbi() helper so that we can avoid
distracting asm boilerplate every time we want a TLBI. As some TLBI
operations take an argument while others do not, some pre-processor is
used to handle these two cases with different assembly blocks.

The existing tlbflush.h code is moved over to use the helper.
