selinux: drop SECURITY_SELINUX_POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX

Remove the SECURITY_SELINUX_POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX Kconfig option

Per: https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/wiki/Kernel-Todo

This was only needed on Fedora 3 and 4 and just causes issues now,
so drop it.

The MAX and MIN should just be whatever the kernel can support.
