greybus: es2: use official USB vendor/device id

We now have an officially assigned Google USB device id for the
APBridge, so add in support for it in the es2 driver.  The old entry can
be removed once the firmware has caught up and uses the new number.

We should use the version field to determine ES1/ES2/ES3, but that will
come later, for now, grab anything with this device id.
