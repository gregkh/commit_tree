fix ITER_PIPE interaction with direct_IO

by making sure we call iov_iter_advance() on original
iov_iter even if direct_IO (done on its copy) has returned 0.
It's a no-op for old iov_iter flavours and does the right thing
(== truncation of the stuff we'd allocated, but not filled) in
ITER_PIPE case.  Failures (e.g. -EIO) get caught and dealt with
by cleanup in generic_file_read_iter().
