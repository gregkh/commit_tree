greybus: camera-gb: Extend the configure streams interface

Extending the configure streams interface with CSI params.
Getting CSI frequency data form configure streams response.
 * num_lanes - Number of CSI data lanes
 * clk_freq - CSI clock frequency in Hz
 * lines_per_second - Total number of lines in a second of
transmission (blanking included)

From the AP side we need to know for the CSI speed
configuration. This information is needed for dynamically
bandwidth calculations.

NOTE: Change should be along merged with corresponding
      interface change in kernel:
      "camera: Extend the configure streams
      interface with CSI params"
