mm: vma_adjust: remove superfluous confusing update in remove_next == 1 case

mm->highest_vm_end doesn't need any update.

After finally removing the oddness from vma_merge case 8 that was
causing:

1) constant risk of trouble whenever anybody would check vma fields
   from rmap_walks, like it happened when page migration was
   introduced and it read the vma->vm_page_prot from a rmap_walk

2) the callers of vma_merge to re-initialize any value different from
   the current vma, instead of vma_merge() more reliably returning a
   vma that already matches all fields passed as parameter

.. it is also worth to take the opportunity of cleaning up superfluous
code in vma_adjust(), that if not removed adds up to the hard
readability of the function.
