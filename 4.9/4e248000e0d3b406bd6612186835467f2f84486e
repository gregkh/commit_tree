usb: hub: change CLEAR_FEATURE to SET_FEATURE

In USB20 specification, describes in chapter 9.4.5: The Remote Wakeup
field can be modified by the SetFeature() and ClearFeature() requests
using the DEVICE_REMOTE_WAKEUP feature selector.

In USB30 specification, also describes in chapter 9.4.5: The Function
Remote Wakeup field can be modified by the SetFeature() requests
using the FUNCTION_SUSPEND feature selector. In chapter 9.4.9 Set
Feature reference, it describes Function Remote Wake Enabled/Disabled
at suspend options by SET_FEATURE.

In USB30 specification only mentioned SetFeature(), so we need use
SET_FEATURE replace CLEAR_FEATURE to disable USB30 function remote
wakeup in suspend options.
