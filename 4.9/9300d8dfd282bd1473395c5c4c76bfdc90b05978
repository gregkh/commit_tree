mm/page_owner: don't define fields on struct page_ext by hard-coding

There is a memory waste problem if we define field on struct page_ext by
hard-coding.  Entry size of struct page_ext includes the size of those
fields even if it is disabled at runtime.  Now, extra memory request at
runtime is possible so page_owner don't need to define it's own fields
by hard-coding.

This patch removes hard-coded define and uses extra memory for storing
page_owner information in page_owner.  Most of code are just mechanical
changes.
