drm/i915: Pass crtc_state and connector_state to encoder functions

This is mostly code churn, with exception of a few places:
- intel_display.c has changes in intel_sanitize_encoder
- intel_ddi.c has intel_ddi_fdi_disable calling intel_ddi_post_disable,
  and required a function change. Also affects intel_display.c
- intel_dp_mst.c passes a NULL crtc_state and conn_state to
  intel_ddi_post_disable for shutting down the real encoder.

  If we would pass conn_state, then conn_state->connector !=
  intel_dig_port->connector and conn_state->best_encoder !=
  to_intel_encoder(intel_dig_port).

  We also shouldn't pass crtc_state, because in that case the
  disabling sequence may potentially be different depending on
  which crtc is disabled last. Nice way to introduce bugs.

No other functional changes are done, diff stat is already huge.
Each encoder type will need to be fixed to use the atomic states
separately.
