x86/sysfb: Fix lfb_size calculation

The screen_info.lfb_size field is shifted by 16 bits *only* in case of
VBE. This has historical reasons since VBE advertised it similarly.
However, in case of EFI framebuffers, the size is no longer shifted. Fix
the x86 simple-framebuffer setup code to use the correct size in the
non-VBE case.

While at it, avoid variable abbreviations and rename 'len' to 'length',
and use the correct types matching the screen_info definition.
