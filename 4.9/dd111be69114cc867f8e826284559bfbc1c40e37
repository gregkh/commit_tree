swapfile: fix memory corruption via malformed swapfile

When root activates a swap partition whose header has the wrong
endianness, nr_badpages elements of badpages are swabbed before
nr_badpages has been checked, leading to a buffer overrun of up to 8GB.

This normally is not a security issue because it can only be exploited
by root (more specifically, a process with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or the ability
to modify a swap file/partition), and such a process can already e.g.
modify swapped-out memory of any other userspace process on the system.
