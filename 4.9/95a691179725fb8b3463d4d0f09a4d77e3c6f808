hso: Use a more common logging style

Macros that end in an underscore are just odd.
Add hso_dbg(level, fmt, ...) and use it everwhere instead.

Several uses had additional unnecessary newlines as the
macro added a newline.  Remove the newline from the macro
and add newlines to each use as appropriate.

Remove now unused D<digit> macros.
