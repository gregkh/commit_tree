usb: dwc3: gadget: avoid while (1) loop on completion

We know that we have to iterate over the list of
started requests. Instead of looping forever, we can
rely on list_for_each_entry(). Likewise, instead of
a do {} while loop over all, maybe available,
scatterlist entries, we can detect if $this request
uses scatterlist and rely on for_each_sg().

This makes the code easier to follow while making
sure that we will *always* break out of the loop.
