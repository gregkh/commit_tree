powerpc/oops: Fix missing pr_cont()s in instruction dump

Since the KERN_CONT changes, the current code in show_instructions()
prints out a whole bunch of unnecessary newlines. Change occurrences of
printk("\n") to pr_cont("\n"). While we're here, change all the other
cases of printk(KERN_CONT ...) to pr_cont() as well.
