staging/rtl8192e: use s8 instead of char

Compiling the rtlwifi drivers for ARM with gcc -Wextra warns about lots of
incorrect code that results from 'char' being unsigned here, e.g.

staging/rtl8192e/rtl8192e/r8192E_phy.c:1072:36: error: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Werror=type-limits]
staging/rtl8192e/rtl8192e/r8192E_phy.c:1104:36: error: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Werror=type-limits]
staging/rtl8192e/rtl8192e/rtl_core.c:1987:16: error: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Werror=type-limits]
staging/rtl8192e/rtl8192e/rtl_dm.c:782:37: error: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Werror=type-limits]
staging/rtl8192e/rtllib_softmac_wx.c:465:16: error: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Werror=type-limits]

This patch changes all uses of 'char' in this driver that refer to
8-bit integers to use 's8' instead, which is signed on all architectures.
