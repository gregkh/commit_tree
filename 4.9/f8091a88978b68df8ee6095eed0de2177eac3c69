MIPS: PCI: Split pci.c into pci.c & pci-legacy.c

Split out the parts of pci.c that are used by existing systems with
MIPS-style PCI drivers but that will not be used by systems with more
generic PCI drivers such as pcie-xilinx. This is done in preparation for
allowing configurations where the code moved to pci-legacy.c is not
built.
