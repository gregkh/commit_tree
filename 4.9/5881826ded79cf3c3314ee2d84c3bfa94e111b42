dmaengine: imx-sdma - update the residue calculation for cyclic channels

The calculation of the DMA transaction residue supports only fixed
size data transfers. This implementation is not covering all
operations (e.g. data receiving) when we need to know the exact amount
of bytes transferred.

The loop channels handling was changed to clear the buffer
descriptor errors and use the bd->mode.count to calculate the
residue.
