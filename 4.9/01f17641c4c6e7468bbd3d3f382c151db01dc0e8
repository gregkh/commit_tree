scsi: ncr5380: Avoid a compiler warning

With commit 3a0f64bfa907 ("mac_scsi: Fix pseudo DMA implementation")
some versions of gcc now warn:

In file included from drivers/scsi/mac_scsi.c:335:
drivers/scsi/NCR5380.h:295: warning: `NCR5380_poll_politely' declared inline after being called
drivers/scsi/NCR5380.h:295: warning: previous declaration of `NCR5380_poll_politely' was here

Avoid this by defining NCR5380_poll_politely() in NCR5380.h.
