gpio: acpi: separation of concerns

The generic GPIO library directly implement code for acpi_find_gpio()
which is only used with CONFIG_ACPI. This was probably done because
OF did the same thing, but I removed that so remove this too.

Rename the internal acpi_find_gpio() in gpiolib-acpi.c to
acpi_populate_gpio_lookup() which seems to be more appropriate anyway
so as to avoid a namespace clash with the same function.

Make the stub return -ENOENT rather than -ENOSYS (as that is for
syscalls!).

For some reason the sunxi pin control driver was including the private
gpiolib header, it works just fine without it so remove that oneliner.
