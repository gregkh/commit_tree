IB/cma: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

alloc_ordered_workqueue() with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set, replaces
deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue(). This is the identity
conversion.

The workqueue "cma_wq" queues work item cma_work_handler. It has been
identity converted.

WQ_MEM_RECLAIM has been set to ensure forward progress under
memory pressure.
