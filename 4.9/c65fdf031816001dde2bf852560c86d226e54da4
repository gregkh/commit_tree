greybus: tracing: fix module num_interfaces

A module's num_interfaces field is included in the data to be
recorded for tracing, but it's never assigned or reported.  Fix
its type to be size_t, to match its definition in the gb_module
structure.

Also correct a format length modifier used for a host device's
num_cports field.
