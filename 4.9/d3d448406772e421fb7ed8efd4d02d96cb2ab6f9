greybus: svc: Add helpers to create AP<->SVC connection

SVC connection is required before the AP knows its position on the endo
and type of endo. To enable message processing between the AP and SVC at
this time, we need a partially initialized connection which can handle
these messages.

Once the AP receives more information from the SVC, it can discard this
partially initialized connection and create a proper one, tied to a
bundle and interface.

Destroying the partially initialized connection is a bit tricky, as it
is required to send a response to svc-hello. That part will be properly
fixed separately.
