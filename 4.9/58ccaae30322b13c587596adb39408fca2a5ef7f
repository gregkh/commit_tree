vme: fake: mark symbols static where possible

We get 4 warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c:384:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'fake_lm_check' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c:619:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'fake_vmewrite8' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c:649:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'fake_vmewrite16' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c:679:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'fake_vmewrite32' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
