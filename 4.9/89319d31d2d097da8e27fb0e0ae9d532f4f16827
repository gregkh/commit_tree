fs: remove aio_run_iocb

Pass the ABI iocb structure to aio_setup_rw and let it handle the
non-vectored I/O case as well.  With that and a new helper for the AIO
return value handling we can now define new aio_read and aio_write
helpers that implement reads and writes in a self-contained way without
duplicating too much code.
