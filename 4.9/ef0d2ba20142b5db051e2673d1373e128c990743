greybus: define greybus function abstraction

Define new source files "function.h" and "function.c" to contain the
definitions of the Greybus function abstraction.  A Greybus function
represents an active entity connected to a CPort implemented by a
Greybus interface.  A Greybus function has a type, which defines the
protocol to be used to interact with the function.  A Greybus
interface normally has at least two functions, but potentially many
more.
