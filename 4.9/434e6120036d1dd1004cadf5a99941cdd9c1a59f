fs/afs/flock: Remove deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue

The workqueue "afs_lock_manager" queues work item &vnode->lock_work,
per vnode. Since there can be multiple vnodes and since their work items
can be executed concurrently, alloc_workqueue has been used to replace
the deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue instance.

The WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag has been set to ensure forward progress under
memory pressure because the workqueue is being used on a memory reclaim
path.

Since there are fixed number of work items, explicit concurrency
limit is unnecessary here.
