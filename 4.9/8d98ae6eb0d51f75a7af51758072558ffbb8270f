iwlwifi: mvm: re-assign old queues after hw restart in dqa mode

When working in DQA mode, if a queue is shared and a HW restart
occurs, there might be a possible race condition between
stations on the queues, and an existing queue might be left
with no queues.

To solve this, make sure in DQA mode to re-assign the same
queues as before the HW restart.
