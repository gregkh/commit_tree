ip_tunnel: add collect_md mode to IPIP tunnel

Similar to gre, vxlan, geneve tunnels allow IPIP tunnels to
operate in 'collect metadata' mode.
bpf_skb_[gs]et_tunnel_key() helpers can make use of it right away.
ovs can use it as well in the future (once appropriate ovs-vport
abstractions and user apis are added).
Note that just like in other tunnels we cannot cache the dst,
since tunnel_info metadata can be different for every packet.
