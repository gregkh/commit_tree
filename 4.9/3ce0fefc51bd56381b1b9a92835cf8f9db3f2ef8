ARCv2: intc: untangle SMP, MCIP and IDU

The IDU intc is technically part of MCIP (Multi-core IP) hence
historically was only available in a SMP hardware build (and thus only
in a SMP kernel build). Now that hardware restriction has been lifted,
so a UP kernel needs to support it.

This requires breaking mcip.c into parts which are strictly SMP
(inter-core interrupts) and IDU which in reality is just another
intc and thus has no bearing on SMP.

This change allows IDU in UP builds and with a suitable device tree, we
can have the cascaded intc system

    ARCv2 core intc <---> ARCv2 IDU intc <---> periperals
