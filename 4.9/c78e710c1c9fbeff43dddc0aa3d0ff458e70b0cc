parisc: Purge TLB before setting PTE

The attached change interchanges the order of purging the TLB and
setting the corresponding page table entry.  TLB purges are strongly
ordered.  It occurred to me one night that setting the PTE first might
have subtle ordering issues on SMP machines and cause random memory
corruption.

A TLB lock guards the insertion of user TLB entries.  So after the TLB
is purged, a new entry can't be inserted until the lock is released.
This ensures that the new PTE value is used when the lock is released.

Since making this change, no random segmentation faults have been
observed on the Debian hppa buildd servers.
