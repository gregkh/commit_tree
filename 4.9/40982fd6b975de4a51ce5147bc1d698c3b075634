arm64: always enable DEBUG_RODATA and remove the Kconfig option

Follow the example set by x86 in commit 9ccaf77cf05915f5 ("x86/mm:
Always enable CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA and remove the Kconfig option"), and
make these protections a fundamental security feature rather than an
opt-in. This also results in a minor code simplification.

For those rare cases when users wish to disable this protection (e.g.
for debugging), this can be done by passing 'rodata=off' on the command
line.

As DEBUG_RODATA_ALIGN is only intended to address a performance/memory
tradeoff, and does not affect correctness, this is left user-selectable.
DEBUG_MODULE_RONX is also left user-selectable until the core code
provides a boot-time option to disable the protection for debugging
use-cases.
