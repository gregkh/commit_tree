MIPS: Sanitise coherentio semantics

The coherentio variable has previously been used as a boolean value,
indicating whether the user specified that coherent I/O should be
enabled or disabled. It failed to take into account the case where the
user does not specify any preference, in which case it makes sense that
we should default to coherent I/O if the hardware supports it
(hw_coherentio is non-zero).

Introduce an enum to clarify the 3 different values of coherentio & use
it throughout the code, modifying plat_device_is_coherent() &
r4k_cache_init() to take into account the default case.
