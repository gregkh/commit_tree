[media] v4l: vsp1: Prevent pipelines from running when not streaming

Pipelines can only be run if all their video nodes are streaming. Commit
b4dfb9b35a19 ("[media] v4l: vsp1: Stop the pipeline upon the first
STREAMOFF") fixed the pipeline stop sequence, but introduced a race
condition that makes it possible to run a pipeline after stopping the
stream on a video node by queuing a buffer on the other side of the
pipeline.

Fix this by clearing the buffers ready flag when stopping the stream,
which will prevent the QBUF handler from running the pipeline.
