PCI: dra7xx: Make explicitly non-modular

This code is not being built as a module by anyone:

  drivers/pci/host/Kconfig:config PCI_DRA7XX
  drivers/pci/host/Kconfig:  bool "TI DRA7xx PCIe controller"

Remove uses of MODULE_DESCRIPTION(), MODULE_AUTHOR(), MODULE_LICENSE(),
etc., so that when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.
The information is preserved in comments at the top of the file.

Note that for non-modular code, MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op and
builtin_platform_driver_probe() uses the same init level priority as
module_platform_driver_probe(), so this doesn't change init ordering.

Explicitly disallow driver unbind, since that doesn't have a sensible use
case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove" code for non-modular
drivers.
