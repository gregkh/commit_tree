video: fbdev: exynos: Remove old non-working MIPI driver

The old non-DRM Exynos MIPI driver does not support DeviceTree and
requires board files.  Our platforms do not provide such so the driver
is not usable since a long time ago.  All features provided by the
driver (and associated s6e8ax0 panel driver) are already supported by
newer DRM version so the old code can be removed.
