audit: consistently record PIDs with task_tgid_nr()

Unfortunately we record PIDs in audit records using a variety of
methods despite the correct way being the use of task_tgid_nr().
This patch converts all of these callers, except for the case of
AUDIT_SET in audit_receive_msg() (see the comment in the code).
