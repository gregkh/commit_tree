get rid of separate multipage fault-in primitives

* the only remaining callers of "short" fault-ins are just as happy with generic
variants (both in lib/iov_iter.c); switch them to multipage variants, kill the
"short" ones
* rename the multipage variants to now available plain ones.
* get rid of compat macro defining iov_iter_fault_in_multipage_readable by
expanding it in its only user.
