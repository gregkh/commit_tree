Revert "HID: microsoft: fix invalid rdesc for 3k kbd"

This reverts commit 3ccc60f9d8c39180c205dba1a020735bda1b2491.

While investigating bug https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37982 ,
there was solid evidences that Microsoft reused the same report
descriptor for the its Digital Media keyboard series.

Since 1989dad "HID: input: ignore System Control application usages if not
System Controls", the keyboard series do not produce a spurious joystick
input device inode without needing to patch the problematic report
descriptor. As such the MS_RDESC_3K reportdescriptor fixup can be removed.
