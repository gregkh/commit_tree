powerpc: Fix usage of _PAGE_RO in hugepage

On some CPUs like the 8xx, _PAGE_RW hence _PAGE_WRITE is defined
as 0 and _PAGE_RO has to be set when a page is not writable

_PAGE_RO is defined by default in pte-common.h, however BOOK3S/64
doesn't include that file so _PAGE_RO has to be defined explicitly
in book3s/64/pgtable.h
