usb: dwc2: Add delay to core soft reset

Add a delay to the core soft reset function to account for the IDDIG
debounce filter.

If the current mode is host, either due to the force mode bit being
set (which persists after core reset) or the connector id pin, a core
soft reset will temporarily reset the mode to device and a delay from
the IDDIG debounce filter will occur before going back to host mode.
