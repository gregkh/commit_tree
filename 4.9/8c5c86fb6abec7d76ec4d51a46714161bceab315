x86/platform/intel-mid: Register watchdog device after SCU

Watchdog device in Intel Tangier relies on SCU to be present. It uses the SCU
IPC channel to send commands and receive responses. If watchdog driver is
initialized quite before SCU and a command has been sent the result is always
an error like the following:

	intel_mid_wdt: Error stopping watchdog: 0xffffffed

Register watchdog device whne SCU is ready to avoid described issue.
