ARM: imx legacy: armadillo5x0: move peripheral initialization to .init_late

The change moves some of peripheral registrations and initializations
(all peripherals dependent on GPIOs) from .init_machine to .init_late
level, this allows to safely shift the shared GPIO controller driver
initialization level after init level of i.MX IOMUXC driver.
