openvswitch: use percpu flow stats

Instead of using flow stats per NUMA node, use it per CPU. When using
megaflows, the stats lock can be a bottleneck in scalability.

On a E5-2690 12-core system, usual throughput went from ~4Mpps to
~15Mpps when forwarding between two 40GbE ports with a single flow
configured on the datapath.

This has been tested on a system with possible CPUs 0-7,16-23. After
module removal, there were no corruption on the slab cache.
