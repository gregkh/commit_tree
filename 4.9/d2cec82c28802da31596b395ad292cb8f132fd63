power: sbs-battery: Request threaded irq and fix dev callback cookie

Currently the battery detect gpio can not be used with a chained interrupt
controller that requires threaded irq handlers. Use threaded irq instead.
In addition this was not going to be working at present because
chip->power_supply is assigned after the request irq call.
