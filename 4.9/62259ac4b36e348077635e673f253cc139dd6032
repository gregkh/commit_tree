be2net: Add privilege level check for OPCODE_COMMON_GET_EXT_FAT_CAPABILITIES SLI cmd.

Driver issues OPCODE_COMMON_GET_EXT_FAT_CAPABILITIES cmd during init which
when issued by VFs results in the logging of a cmd failure message since
they don't have the required privilege for this cmd. Fix by checking
privilege before issuing the cmd.

Also fixed typo in CAPABILITIES.
