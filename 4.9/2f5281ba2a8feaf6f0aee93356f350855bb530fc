net: ti: cpmac: Fix compiler warning due to type confusion

cpmac_start_xmit() used the max() macro on skb->len (an unsigned int)
and ETH_ZLEN (a signed int literal). This led to the following compiler
warning:

  In file included from include/linux/list.h:8:0,
                   from include/linux/module.h:9,
                   from drivers/net/ethernet/ti/cpmac.c:19:
  drivers/net/ethernet/ti/cpmac.c: In function 'cpmac_start_xmit':
  include/linux/kernel.h:748:17: warning: comparison of distinct pointer
  types lacks a cast
    (void) (&_max1 == &_max2);  \
                   ^
  drivers/net/ethernet/ti/cpmac.c:560:8: note: in expansion of macro 'max'
    len = max(skb->len, ETH_ZLEN);
          ^

On top of this, it assigned the result of the max() macro to a signed
integer whilst all further uses of it result in it being cast to varying
widths of unsigned integer.

Fix this up by using max_t to ensure the comparison is performed as
unsigned integers, and for consistency change the type of the len
variable to unsigned int.
