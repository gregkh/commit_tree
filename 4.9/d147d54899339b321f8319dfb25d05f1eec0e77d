Revert "gpio: pca953x: initialize ret to zero to avoid returning garbage"

This reverts commit 313b9a9938bf4076425741121d5d766826793e5d.

This was already fixed by
commit bf62efeb164343916ebb89dca6dfe5e6b6751700
"gpio: pca954x: fix undefined error code from remove"

The latter is a better fix since it makes it easier to detect
erronous code by not assigning a default error code.
