mmc: sdhci: cast unsigned int to unsigned long long to avoid unexpeted error

Potentially overflowing expression 1000000 * data->timeout_clks with
type unsigned int is evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic, and then used
in a context that expects an expression of type unsigned long long.

To avoid overflow, cast 1000000U to type unsigned long long.
Special thanks to Coverity.
