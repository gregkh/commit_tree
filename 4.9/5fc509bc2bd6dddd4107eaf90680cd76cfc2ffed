xen/x86: Move irq allocation from Xen smp_op.cpu_up()

Commit ce0d3c0a6fb1 ("genirq: Revert sparse irq locking around
__cpu_up() and move it to x86 for now") reverted irq locking
introduced by commit a89941816726 ("hotplug: Prevent alloc/free
of irq descriptors during cpu up/down") because of Xen allocating
irqs in both of its cpu_up ops.

We can move those allocations into CPU notifiers so that original
patch can be reinstated.
