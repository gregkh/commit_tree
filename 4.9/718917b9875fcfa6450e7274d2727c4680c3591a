i2c: tegra: Add pinctrl support

On Tegra124/132 the pins for I2C6 are shared with the Display Port AUX
(DPAUX) channel and on Tegra210 the pins for I2C4 and I2C6 are shared
with DPAUX1 and DPAUX0, respectively. The multiplexing of the pins is
handled by a register in the DPAUX and so the Tegra DPAUX driver has
been updated to register a pinctrl device for managing these pins.

The pins for these particular I2C devices are bound to the I2C device
prior to probing. However, these I2C devices are in a different power
partition to the DPAUX devices that own the pins. Hence, it is desirable
to place the pins in the 'idle' state and allow the DPAUX power
partition to switch off, when these I2C devices is not in use.
Therefore, add calls to place the I2C pins in the 'default' and 'idle'
states when the I2C device is runtime resumed and suspended,
respectively.

Please note that the pinctrl functions that set the state of the pins
check to see if the devices has pins associated and will return zero
if they do not. Therefore, it is safe to call these pinctrl functions
even for I2C devices that do not have any pins associated.
