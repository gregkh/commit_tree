arm64 Kconfig: select gigantic page

Arm64 supports gigantic pages after commit 084bd29810a5 ("ARM64: mm:
HugeTLB support.") however, it can only be allocated at boottime and
can't be freed.

This patch selects ARCH_HAS_GIGANTIC_PAGE to make gigantic pages can be
allocated and freed at runtime for arch arm64.
