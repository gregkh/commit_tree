staging: rtl8192u: do not use undefined $(TOPDIR) in Makefile

drivers/staging/rtl8192u/ieee80211/Makefile uses $(TOPDIR) to configure
an include directory, without defining this variable first. The path
which is configured is therefore "/drivers/net/wireless", which does not
seem to be the intended path.

Remove the offending line.
