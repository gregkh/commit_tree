x86/io: add interface to reserve io memtype for a resource range. (v1.1)

A recent change to the mm code in:
87744ab3832b mm: fix cache mode tracking in vm_insert_mixed()

started enforcing checking the memory type against the registered list for
amixed pfn insertion mappings. It happens that the drm drivers for a number
of gpus relied on this being broken. Currently the driver only inserted
VRAM mappings into the tracking table when they came from the kernel,
and userspace mappings never landed in the table. This led to a regression
where all the mapping end up as UC instead of WC now.

I've considered a number of solutions but since this needs to be fixed
in fixes and not next, and some of the solutions were going to introduce
overhead that hadn't been there before I didn't consider them viable at
this stage. These mainly concerned hooking into the TTM io reserve APIs,
but these API have a bunch of fast paths I didn't want to unwind to add
this to.

The solution I've decided on is to add a new API like the arch_phys_wc
APIs (these would have worked but wc_del didn't take a range), and
use them from the drivers to add a WC compatible mapping to the table
for all VRAM on those GPUs. This means we can then create userspace
mapping that won't get degraded to UC.

v1.1: use CONFIG_X86_PAT + add some comments in io.h
