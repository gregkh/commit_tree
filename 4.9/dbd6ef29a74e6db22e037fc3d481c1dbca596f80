drm/i915: Use RCU to annotate and enforce protection for breadcrumb's bh

The bottom-half we use for processing the breadcrumb interrupt is a
task, which is an RCU protected struct. When accessing this struct, we
need to be holding the RCU read lock to prevent it disappearing beneath
us. We can use the RCU annotation to mark our irq_seqno_bh pointer as
being under RCU guard and then use the RCU accessors to both provide
correct ordering of access through the pointer.

Most notably, this fixes the access from hard irq context to use the RCU
read lock, which both Daniel and Tvrtko complained about.
