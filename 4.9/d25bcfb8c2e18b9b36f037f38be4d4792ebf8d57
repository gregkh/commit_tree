drm/hisilicon: Don't set drm_device->platformdev

It's deprecated and only should be used by drivers which still use
drm_platform_init, not by anyone else.

And indeed it's entirely unused and can be nuked.

This required a bit more fudging, but I guess kirin_dc_ops really
wants to operate on the platform_device, not something else. Also
bonus points for implementing abstraction, and then storing the vfunc
in a global variable.
