wil6210: change HALP logging category to IRQ

Change the logging category of HALP functions from
MISC to IRQ, since the HALP mechanism is closely
related to interrupts. Both HALP and IRQ create
a heavy load of logging messages when enabled,
so their logging is typically disabled during normal debug
scenarios. Having them in the same logging category
will make it easier to disable logging for both in one go.
