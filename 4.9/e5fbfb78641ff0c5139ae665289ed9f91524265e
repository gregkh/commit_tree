fm10k: NAPI polling routine must return actual work done

When fm10k_poll fully cleans rings it returns 0. This is incorrect as it
messes up the budget accounting in the core NAPI code. Fix this by
returning actual work done, capped at budget - 1 since the core doesn't
expect a return of the full budget when the driver modifies the NAPI
status.
