ARC: IRQ: Do not use hwirq as virq and vice versa

This came up when reviewing code to address missing IRQ affinity
setting in AXS103 platform and/or implementing hierarchical IRQ domains

- smp_ipi_irq_setup() callers pass hwirq but in turn calls
  request_percpu_irq() which expects a linux virq. So invoke
  irq_find_mapping() to do the conversion
  (also explicitify this in code by renaming the args appropriately)

- idu_of_init()/idu_cascade_isr() were similarly using linux virq where
  hwirq is expected, so do the conversion using irqd_to_hwirq() helper
