vmbus: make sysfs names consistent with PCI

In commit 9a56e5d6a0ba ("Drivers: hv: make VMBus bus ids persistent")
the name of vmbus devices in sysfs changed to be (in 4.9-rc1):
  /sys/bus/vmbus/vmbus-6aebe374-9ba0-11e6-933c-00259086b36b

The prefix ("vmbus-") is redundant and differs from how PCI is
represented in sysfs. Therefore simplify to:
  /sys/bus/vmbus/6aebe374-9ba0-11e6-933c-00259086b36b

Please merge this before 4.9 is released and the old format
has to live forever.
