greybus: operation: fix broken response tracepoint

The response-received tracepoint is currently broken. Instead of parsing
the received message header it was tracing a bunch of zeroed fields from
an uninitialised response buffer.

Fix this by moving the tracepoint after were the response buffer is
initialised.
