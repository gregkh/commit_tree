Drivers: hv: cleanup vmbus_open() for wrap around mappings

In preparation for doing wrap around mappings for ring buffers cleanup
vmbus_open() function:
- check that ring sizes are PAGE_SIZE aligned (they are for all in-kernel
  drivers now);
- kfree(open_info) on error only after we kzalloc() it (not an issue as it
  is valid to call kfree(NULL);
- rename poorly named labels;
- use alloc_pages() instead of __get_free_pages() as we need struct page
  pointer for future.
