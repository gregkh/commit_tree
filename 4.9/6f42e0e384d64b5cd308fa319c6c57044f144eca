MIPS: Lantiq: Make xrx200_phy_fw explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/mips/lantiq/Kconfig:config XRX200_PHY_FW
arch/mips/lantiq/Kconfig:       bool "XRX200 PHY firmware loader"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file doesn't need that.
