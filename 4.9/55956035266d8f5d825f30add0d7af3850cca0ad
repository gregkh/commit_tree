pinctrl: aspeed: fix regmap error handling

The newly added aspeed driver tries to check for a negative return
value from a pinctrl function, but stores the intermediate value in
a 'bool' variable, which cannot work:

drivers/pinctrl/aspeed/pinctrl-aspeed.c: In function 'aspeed_sig_expr_set':
drivers/pinctrl/aspeed/pinctrl-aspeed.c:192:11: error: comparison of constant '0' with boolean expression is always false [-Werror=bool-compare]

This slightly reworks the logic to use an explicit comparison with zero
before assigning to the temporary variable.
