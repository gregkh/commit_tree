ARC: boot log: refactor cpu name/release printing

The motivation is to identify ARC750 vs. ARC770 (we currently print
generic "ARC700").

A given ARC700 release could be 750 or 770, with same ARCNUM (or family
identifier which is unfortunate). The existing arc_cpu_tbl[] kept a single
concatenated string for core name and release which thus doesn't work
for 750 vs. 770 identification.

So split this into 2 tables, one with core names and other with release.
And while we are at it, get rid of the range checking for family numbers.
We just document the known to exist cores running Linux and ditch
others.

With this in place, we add detection of ARC750 which is
 - cores 0x33 and before
 - cores 0x34 and later with MMUv2
