drm/i915/gen9: only add the planes actually affected by ddb changes

We were previously adding all the planes owned by the CRTC even when
the ddb partitioning didn't change for them. As a consequence, a lot
of functions were being called when we were just moving the cursor
around the screen, such as skylake_update_primary_plane().

This was causing flickering on the primary plane when moving the
cursor. I'm not 100% sure which operation caused the flickering, but
we were writing to a lot of registers, so it could be any of these
writes. With this patch, just moving the mouse won't add the primary
plane to the commit since it won't trigger a change in DDB
partitioning.

v2: Use skl_ddb_entry_equal() (Lyude).
v3: Change Reported-and-bisected-by: to Reported-by: for checkpatch
