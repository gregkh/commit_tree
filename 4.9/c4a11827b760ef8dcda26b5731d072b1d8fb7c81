scsi: cxlflash: Fix context reference tracking on detach

Commit 888baf069f49 ("scsi: cxlflash: Add kref to context") introduced a
kref to the context. In particular, the detach routine was updated to
use the kref services for managing the removal and destruction of a
context.

As part of this change, the tracking mechanism internal to the detach
handler was refactored. This introduced a bug that can cause the
tracking state to be lost. This can lead to a situation where exclusive
access to a context is prematurely [and unknowingly] relinquished for
the executing thread.

To remedy, only update the tracking state when the kref operation
indicates the context was removed.
