i2c: tegra: Add runtime power-management support

Update the Tegra I2C driver to use runtime PM and move the code in the
tegra_i2c_clock_enable/disable() functions to the PM runtime resume and
suspend callbacks, respectively.

Note that given that CONFIG_PM is not mandatory for Tegra, if CONFIG_PM
is not enabled and so runtime PM is not enabled, ensure that the I2C
clocks are turned on during probe and kept on by calling the resume
callback directly.

In the function tegra_i2c_init(), the variable 'err' does not need to be
initialised to zero in tegra_i2c_init() because it is initialised when
pm_runtime_get_sync() is called. Furthermore, to ensure we only return 0
from tegra_i2c_init(), it is necessary to re-initialise 'err' to 0 after
a successful call to pm_runtime_get_sync() because it can return a
positive value on success. However, alternatively re-initialise 'err' by
using the return value of the function tegra_i2c_flush_fifos() because
it can only be 0 or -ETIMEDOUT.
