xfs: fix locking for DAX writes

So far DAX writes inherited the locking from direct I/O writes, but
the direct I/O model of using shared locks for writes is actually
wrong for DAX.  For direct I/O we're out of any standards and don't
have to provide the Posix required exclusion between writers, but
for DAX which gets transparently enable on applications without any
knowledge of it we can't simply drop the requirement.  Even worse
this only happens for aligned writes and thus doesn't show up for
many typical use cases.
