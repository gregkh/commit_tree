drm/tilcdc: fix wrong error handling

When 'component_bind_all' fails it should not try to unbind components
in the error handling. This will produce a null pointer kernel panic when
no component exist.

This patch changes the order of the error handling. Now, it will only
unbind components if the are bound. Otherwise, the module will jump to
an error label below.
