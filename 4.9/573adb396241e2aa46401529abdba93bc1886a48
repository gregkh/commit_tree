drm/i915: Move obj->active:5 to obj->flags

We are motivated to avoid using a bitfield for obj->active for a couple
of reasons. Firstly, we wish to document our lockless read of obj->active
using READ_ONCE inside i915_gem_busy_ioctl() and that requires an
integral type (i.e. not a bitfield). Secondly, gcc produces abysmal code
when presented with a bitfield and that shows up high on the profiles of
request tracking (mainly due to excess memory traffic as it converts
the bitfield to a register and back and generates frequent AGI in the
process).

v2: BIT, break up a long line in compute the other engines, new paint
for i915_gem_object_is_active (now i915_gem_object_get_active).
