perf ui/stdio: Always reset output width for hierarchy

When the --hierarchy option is used, each entry has its own hpp_list to
show the result.  But it is not updating the width of each column for
perf-top.  The perf-report command has no problem since it resets it
during header display.

  $ sudo perf top --hierarchy --stdio

   PerfTop:     160 irqs/sec  kernel:38.8%  exact: 100.0%
                                     [4000Hz cycles:pp],  (all, 12 CPUs)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   52.32%     perf
      24.74%     [.] __symbols__insert
      5.62%     [.] rb_next
      5.14%     [.] dso__load_sym

Move the code into hists__fprintf() so that it can be called always.
Also it'd be better to put similar code together.
