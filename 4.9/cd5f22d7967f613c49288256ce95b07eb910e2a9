arm64: arch_timer: simplify accessors

A while back we added {read,write}_sysreg accessors to handle accesses
to system registers, without the usual boilerplate asm volatile,
temporary variable, etc.

This patch makes use of these in the arm64 arch timer accessors to make
the code shorter and clearer.
