platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: Change error checking logic from TCI functions

Currently the success/error checking logic is intermixed, making the
code a bit cumbersome to understand.

This patch changes the affected functions to first check for errors
and take appropriate actions, then check for the supported features.

This patch also separates the error check from the acpi_status and
the tci_raw function call error check, as those two are completely
unrelated and were nested in if/else statements.
