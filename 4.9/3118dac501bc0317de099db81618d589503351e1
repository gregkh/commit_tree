kernel/irq: Export irq_set_parent()

The TPS65217 driver grew interrupt support which uses
irq_set_parent(). While it's not yet clear why this is used in the first
place, building the driver as a module fails with:

 ERROR: ".irq_set_parent" [drivers/mfd/tps65217.ko] undefined!

The correctness of the driver change is still investigated, but for now
it's less trouble to export irq_set_parent() than dealing with the build
wreckage.

[ tglx: Rewrote changelog and made the export GPL ]
