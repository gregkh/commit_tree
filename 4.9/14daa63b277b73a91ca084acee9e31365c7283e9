drm/i915: Stop marking the unaccessible scratch page as UC

Since by design, if not entirely by practice, nothing is allowed to
access the scratch page we use to background fill the VM, then we do not
need to ensure that it is coherent between the CPU and GPU.
set_pages_uc() does a stop_machine() after changing the PAT, and that
significantly impacts upon context creation throughput.
