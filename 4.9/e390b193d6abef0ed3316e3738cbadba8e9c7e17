greybus: svc: remove unneeded fields from the unipro set route message payload

CPort connections are being handled in the application layer connection
protocol and the layer 3 switch doesn't care about them. Also, the
switch doesn't care about a source device id when setting up the route
table. Reduce the message to just the necessary destination device ID.

As the SVC is aware of which switch port it found the module/interface
and assigned the device ID, we can simply tell the SVC to set a route
to the device ID it has reported to the AP as being active.
