net/ncsi: Avoid unused-value build warning from ia64-linux-gcc

xchg() is used to set NCSI channel's state in order for consistent
access to the state. xchg()'s return value should be used. Otherwise,
one build warning will be raised (with -Wunused-value) as below message
indicates. It is reported by ia64-linux-gcc (GCC) 4.9.0.

 net/ncsi/ncsi-manage.c: In function 'ncsi_channel_monitor':
 arch/ia64/include/uapi/asm/cmpxchg.h:56:2: warning: value computed is \
 not used [-Wunused-value]
  ((__typeof__(*(ptr))) __xchg((unsigned long) (x), (ptr), sizeof(*(ptr))))
   ^
 net/ncsi/ncsi-manage.c:202:3: note: in expansion of macro 'xchg'
  xchg(&nc->state, NCSI_CHANNEL_INACTIVE);

This removes the atomic access to NCSI channel's state avoid the above
build warning. We have to hold the channel's lock when its state is readed
or updated. No functional changes introduced.
