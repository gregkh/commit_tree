KVM: x86: introduce get_kvmclock_ns

Introduce a function that reads the exact nanoseconds value that is
provided to the guest in kvmclock.  This crystallizes the notion of
kvmclock as a thin veneer over a stable TSC, that the guest will
(hopefully) convert with NTP.  In other words, kvmclock is *not* a
paravirtualized host-to-guest NTP.

Drop the get_kernel_ns() function, that was used both to get the base
value of the master clock and to get the current value of kvmclock.
The former use is replaced by ktime_get_boot_ns(), the latter is
the purpose of get_kernel_ns().

This also allows KVM to provide a Hyper-V time reference counter that
is synchronized with the time that is computed from the TSC page.
