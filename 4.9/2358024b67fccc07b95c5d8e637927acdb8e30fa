greybus: control: suppress bundle_activate() for bootrom

We always knew backward compatibility with the ES3 bootrom, which was
finalised about a year ago, would be a pain. Here we go again.

The bootrom does not support control requests added after it was burnt
into ROM for obvious reasons. This means that we need to suppress
sending the new bundle_activate() operation to any interface executing
the legacy bootrom.

Do so by adding a new NO_PM interface quirk (we can use the
control-protocol version for this later once we bump it).

Note that the interface-disable path (e.g. for power down) is already
handled by the FORCED_DISABLE quirk, and that the suspend/resume
paths are currently avoided by making sure that the bootrom bundle
never suspends.
