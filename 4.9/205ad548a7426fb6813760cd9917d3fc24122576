xtensa: rearrange CCOUNT calibration

DT-enabled kernel should have a CPU node connected to a clock. This clock
is the CCOUNT clock. Use old platform_calibrate_ccount call as a fallback
when CPU node cannot be found or has no clock and in non-DT-enabled
configurations.

Drop no longer needed code that updates CPU clock-frequency property in
the DT; drop DT-related code from the platform_calibrate_ccount too.

Move of_clk_init to the top of time_init, so that clocks are initialized
before CCOUNT calibration is attempted.
