bpf: add BPF_SIZEOF and BPF_FIELD_SIZEOF macros

Add BPF_SIZEOF() and BPF_FIELD_SIZEOF() macros to improve the code a bit
which otherwise often result in overly long bytes_to_bpf_size(sizeof())
and bytes_to_bpf_size(FIELD_SIZEOF()) lines. So place them into a macro
helper instead. Moreover, we currently have a BUILD_BUG_ON(BPF_FIELD_SIZEOF())
check in convert_bpf_extensions(), but we should rather make that generic
as well and add a BUILD_BUG_ON() test in all BPF_SIZEOF()/BPF_FIELD_SIZEOF()
users to detect any rewriter size issues at compile time. Note, there are
currently none, but we want to assert that it stays this way.
