md/raid5: initialize next_checkpoint field before use

No initial operation was done to this field when we
load/recovery the log, it got assignment only when IO
to raid disk was finished. So r5l_quiesce may use wrong
next_checkpoint to reclaim log space, that would make
reclaimable space calculation confused.
