iommu/arm-smmu: Refactor mmu-masters handling

To be able to support the generic bindings and handle of_xlate() calls,
we need to be able to associate SMMUs and stream IDs directly with
devices *before* allocating IOMMU groups. Furthermore, to support real
default domains with multi-device groups we also have to handle domain
attach on a per-device basis, as the "whole group at a time" assumption
fails to properly handle subsequent devices added to a group after the
first has already triggered default domain creation and attachment.

To that end, use the now-vacant dev->archdata.iommu field for easy
config and SMMU instance lookup, and unify config management by chopping
down the platform-device-specific tree and probing the "mmu-masters"
property on-demand instead. This may add a bit of one-off overhead to
initially adding a new device, but we're about to deprecate that binding
in favour of the inherently-more-efficient generic ones anyway.

For the sake of simplicity, this patch does temporarily regress the case
of aliasing PCI devices by losing the duplicate stream ID detection that
the previous per-group config had. Stay tuned, because we'll be back to
fix that in a better and more general way momentarily...
