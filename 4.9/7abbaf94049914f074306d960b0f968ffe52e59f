proc: relax /proc/<tid>/timerslack_ns capability requirements

When an interface to allow a task to change another tasks timerslack was
first proposed, it was suggested that something greater then
CAP_SYS_NICE would be needed, as a task could be delayed further then
what normally could be done with nice adjustments.

So CAP_SYS_PTRACE was adopted instead for what became the
/proc/<tid>/timerslack_ns interface.  However, for Android (where this
feature originates), giving the system_server CAP_SYS_PTRACE would allow
it to observe and modify all tasks memory.  This is considered too high
a privilege level for only needing to change the timerslack.

After some discussion, it was realized that a CAP_SYS_NICE process can
set a task as SCHED_FIFO, so they could fork some spinning processes and
set them all SCHED_FIFO 99, in effect delaying all other tasks for an
infinite amount of time.

So as a CAP_SYS_NICE task can already cause trouble for other tasks,
using it as a required capability for accessing and modifying
/proc/<tid>/timerslack_ns seems sufficient.

Thus, this patch loosens the capability requirements to CAP_SYS_NICE and
removes CAP_SYS_PTRACE, simplifying some of the code flow as well.

This is technically an ABI change, but as the feature just landed in
4.6, I suspect no one is yet using it.
