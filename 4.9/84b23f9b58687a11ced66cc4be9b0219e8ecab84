locking/rwsem: Return void in __rwsem_mark_wake()

We currently return a rw_semaphore structure, which is the
same lock we passed to the function's argument in the first
place. While there are several functions that choose this
return value, the callers use it, for example, for things
like ERR_PTR. This is not the case for __rwsem_mark_wake(),
and in addition this function is really about the lock
waiters (which we know there are at this point), so its
somewhat odd to be returning the sem structure.
