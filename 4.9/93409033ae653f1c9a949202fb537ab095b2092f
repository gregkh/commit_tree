net: Add netdev all_adj_list refcnt propagation to fix panic

This is a respin of a patch to fix a relatively easily reproducible kernel
panic related to the all_adj_list handling for netdevs in recent kernels.

The following sequence of commands will reproduce the issue:

ip link add link eth0 name eth0.100 type vlan id 100
ip link add link eth0 name eth0.200 type vlan id 200
ip link add name testbr type bridge
ip link set eth0.100 master testbr
ip link set eth0.200 master testbr
ip link add link testbr mac0 type macvlan
ip link delete dev testbr

This creates an upper/lower tree of (excuse the poor ASCII art):

            /---eth0.100-eth0
mac0-testbr-
            \---eth0.200-eth0

When testbr is deleted, the all_adj_lists are walked, and eth0 is deleted twice from
the mac0 list. Unfortunately, during setup in __netdev_upper_dev_link, only one
reference to eth0 is added, so this results in a panic.

This change adds reference count propagation so things are handled properly.

Matthias Schiffer reported a similar crash in batman-adv:

which this patch also seems to resolve.
