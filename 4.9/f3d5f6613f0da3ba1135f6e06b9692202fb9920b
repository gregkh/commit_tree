greybus: camera: Clean up on stream configuration failure

When the camera pipeline can't be configured due to a failure of one of
the components (failure to start the CSI transmitter for instance),
components that have already been setup for video streaming need to be
set back to a quiescient state. This is especially important to ensure
that a stream configuration failure won't keep the UniPro links in high
speed mode forever.
