hwmon: (adt7470) No need for additional synchronization on kthread_stop()

The kthread_stop() waits for the thread to exit. There is no need for an
additional synchronization needed to join on the kthread.

The completion was added by 89fac11cb3e7 ("adt7470: make automatic fan
control really work").
