x86/mce: Add support for new MCA_SYND register

Syndrome information is no longer contained in MCA_STATUS for SMCA
systems but in a new register - MCA_SYND.

Add a synd field to struct mce to hold MCA_SYND register value. Add it
to the end of struct mce to maintain compatibility with old versions of
mcelog. Also, add it to the respective tracepoint.
