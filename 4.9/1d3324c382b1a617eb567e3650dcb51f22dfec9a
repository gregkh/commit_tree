scsi: cxlflash: Fix to avoid EEH and host reset collisions

The EEH reset handler is ignorant to the current state of the driver
when processing a frozen event and initiating a device reset. This can
be an issue if an EEH event occurs while a user or stack initiated reset
is executing. More specifically, if an EEH occurs while the SCSI host
reset handler is active, the reset initiated by the EEH thread will
likely collide with the host reset thread. This can leave the device in
an inconsistent state, or worse, cause a system crash.

As a remedy, the EEH handler is updated to evaluate the device state and
take appropriate action (proceed, wait, or disconnect host). The host
reset handler is also updated to handle situations where an EEH occurred
during a host reset. In such situations, the host reset handler will
delay reporting back a success to give the EEH reset an opportunity to
complete.
