tty: serial_core: convert uart_close to use tty_port_close

tty_port_close handles much of the common parts of tty close. Convert
uart_close to use it and move the serial_core specific parts into
tty_port.shutdown function. This will be needed to use tty_port functions
directly from in kernel clients.

This change causes ops->stop_rx() to be called after uart_wait_until_sent()
is called which I think should be fine. Otherwise, the sequence of the
close should be the same.
