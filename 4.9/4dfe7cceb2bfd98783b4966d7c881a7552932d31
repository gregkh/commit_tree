IB/hfi1: Fix a potential memory leak in hfi1_create_ctxts()

In the function hfi1_create_ctxts the array "dd->rcd" is allocated and
then populated with allocated resources in a loop. Previously, if
error happened during the loop, only resource allocated in the current
iteration would be freed. The array itself would then be freed, leaving
the resources that were allocated in previous iterations and referenced
by the array elements in limbo.

This patch makes sure all allocated resources are freed before freeing
the array "dd->rcd". Also the resource allocation now takes account of
the numa node the device is attached to.
