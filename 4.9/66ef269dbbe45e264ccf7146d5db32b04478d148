x86/mce/AMD: Ensure the deferred error interrupt is of type APIC on SMCA systems

The Deferred Error Interrupt Type is set per bank on Scalable MCA
systems. This is done in a bitfield in the MCA_CONFIG register of each
bank. We should set its type to APIC-based interrupt and not assume BIOS
has set it for us.
