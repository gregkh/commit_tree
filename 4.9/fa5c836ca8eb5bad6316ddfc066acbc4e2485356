xfs: refactor xfs_bunmapi_cow

Split out two helpers for deleting delayed or real extents from the COW fork.
This allows to call them directly from xfs_reflink_cow_end_io once that
function is refactored to iterate the extent tree.  It will also allow
to reuse the delalloc deletion from xfs_bunmapi in the future.
