dma-buf: Wait on the reservation object when sync'ing before CPU access

Rendering operations to the dma-buf are tracked implicitly via the
reservation_object (dmabuf->resv). This is used to allow poll() to
wait upon outstanding rendering (or just query the current status of
rendering). The dma-buf sync ioctl allows userspace to prepare the
dma-buf for CPU access, which should include waiting upon rendering.
(Some drivers may need to do more work to ensure that the dma-buf mmap
is coherent as well as complete.)

v2: Always wait upon the reservation object implicitly. We choose to do
it after the native handler in case it can do so more efficiently.
