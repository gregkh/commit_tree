ASoC: Intel: Atom: auto-detection of Baytrail-CR

BYT-CR needs special handling to deal with BIOS issues.
For some reason the IPC interrupt index is also modified from
the Baytrail-T reference.

Use PUNIT BIOS config bits to infer platform details.
Assume regular Baytrail configs if status is incorrect or
CONFIG_IOSF_MBI is not enabled.

SSP0 routing issues are solved without dedicated firmware
in following patches

Tested on Asus T100TA and T100TAF.
