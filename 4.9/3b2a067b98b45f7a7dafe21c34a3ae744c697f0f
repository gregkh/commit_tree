mmc: dw_mmc: avoid race condition of cpu and IDMAC

We could see an obvious race condition by test that
the former write operation by IDMAC aiming to clear
OWN bit reach right after the later configuration of
the same desc, which makes the IDMAC be in SUSPEND
state as the OWN bit was cleared by the asynchronous
write operation of IDMAC. The bug can be very easy
reproduced on RK3288 or similar when we reduce the
running rate of system buses and keep the CPU running
faster. So as two separate masters, IDMAC and cpu
write the same descriptor stored on the same address,
and this should be protected by adding check of OWN
bit before preparing new descriptors.
