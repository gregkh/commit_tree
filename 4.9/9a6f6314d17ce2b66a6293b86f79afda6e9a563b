greybus: use alloc_gbuf_data() for both directions

Change the "direction" flag field of a gbuf to be a Boolean called
"outbound".

Add a Boolean outbound flag to alloc_gbuf_data(), and use it for
allocating the data buffer for gbufs for data being transferred in
either direction.

Update free_gbuf_data() accordingly--letting the host device
driver's gbuf data free function handle all of them.
