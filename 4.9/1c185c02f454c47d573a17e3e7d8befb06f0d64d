gfs2: Remove dirty buffer warning from gfs2_releasepage

Unlike what its documentation suggests, the releasepage address space
operation can currently be called on dirty pages via shrink_active_list.
This may eventually be changed when the remaining code relying on the
current behavior has been fixed, but until then, it makes no sense to
warn on dirty buffers in gfs2_releasepage.
