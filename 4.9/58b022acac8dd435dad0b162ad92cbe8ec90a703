hwrng: core - Allocate memory during module init

In core rng_buffer and rng_fillbuf is allocated in hwrng_register only
once and it is freed during module exit. This patch moves allocating
rng_buffer and rng_fillbuf from hwrng_register to rng core's init. This
avoids checking whether rng_buffer and rng_fillbuf was allocated from
every hwrng_register call. Also moving them to module init makes it
explicit that it is freed in module exit.

Change in v2:
Fix memory leak when register_miscdev fails.
