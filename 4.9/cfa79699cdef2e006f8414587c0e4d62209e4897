greybus: operation: fix incoming request payload size

Fix the payload size of incoming requests, which should not include the
operation message-header size.

When creating requests we pass the sizes of request and response
payloads and greybus core allocates buffers and adds the required
headers. Specifically, the payload sizes do not include the
message-header size.

This is currently not the case for incoming requests however, something
which prevents protocol drivers from implementing appropriate input
verification and could lead to random data being treated as a valid
message in case of a short request.
