rxrpc: fix undefined behavior in rxrpc_mark_call_released

gcc -Wmaybe-initialized correctly points out a newly introduced bug
through which we can end up calling rxrpc_queue_call() for a dead
connection:

net/rxrpc/call_object.c: In function 'rxrpc_mark_call_released':
net/rxrpc/call_object.c:600:5: error: 'sched' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This sets the 'sched' variable to zero to restore the previous
behavior.
