KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Enable IRQ bypass

Add the irq_bypass_add_producer and irq_bypass_del_producer
functions. These functions get called whenever a GSI is being
defined for a guest. They create/remove the mapping between
host real IRQ numbers and the guest GSI.

Add the following helper functions to manage the
passthrough IRQ map.

kvmppc_set_passthru_irq()
  Creates a mapping in the passthrough IRQ map that maps a host
  IRQ to a guest GSI. It allocates the structure (one per guest VM)
  the first time it is called.

kvmppc_clr_passthru_irq()
  Removes the passthrough IRQ map entry given a guest GSI.
  The passthrough IRQ map structure is not freed even when the
  number of mapped entries goes to zero. It is only freed when
  the VM is destroyed.

[paulus@ozlabs.org - modified to use is_pnv_opal_msi() rather than
 requiring all passed-through interrupts to use the same irq_chip;
 changed deletion so it zeroes out the r_hwirq field rather than
 copying the last entry down and decrementing the number of entries.]
