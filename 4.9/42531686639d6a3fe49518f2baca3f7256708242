spi: st-ssc4: Fix misuse of devm_gpio_request/devm_gpio_free APIs

devm_* API is supposed to be used only in probe function call.
The resource is allocated at 'probe' and free automatically at 'remove'.
Usage of devm_* functions outside probe sometimes leads to resource leak.
Thus avoid using devm_* APIs in .setup/.cleanup callbacks.
