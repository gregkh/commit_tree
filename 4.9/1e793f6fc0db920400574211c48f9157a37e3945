scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix data integrity failure for JBOD (passthrough) devices

Commit 02b01e010afe ("megaraid_sas: return sync cache call with
success") modified the driver to successfully complete SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE
commands without passing them to the controller. Disk drive caches are
only explicitly managed by controller firmware when operating in RAID
mode. So this commit effectively disabled writeback cache flushing for
any drives used in JBOD mode, leading to data integrity failures.

[mkp: clarified patch description]
