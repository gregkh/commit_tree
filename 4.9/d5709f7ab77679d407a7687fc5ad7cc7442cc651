flow_dissector: For stripped vlan, get vlan info from skb->vlan_tci

Early in the datapath skb_vlan_untag function is called, stripped
the vlan from the skb and set skb->vlan_tci and skb->vlan_proto fields.

The current dissection doesn't handle stripped vlan packets correctly.
In some flows, vlan doesn't exist in skb->data anymore when applying
flow dissection on the skb, fix that.

In case vlan info wasn't stripped before applying flow_dissector (RPS
flow for example), or in case of skb with multiple vlans (e.g. 802.1ad),
get the vlan info from skb->data. The flow_dissector correctly skips
any number of vlans and stores only the first level vlan.
