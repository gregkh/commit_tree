of/irq: Break out msi-map lookup (again)

The PCI msi-map code is already doing double-duty translating IDs and
retrieving MSI parents, which unsurprisingly is the same functionality
we need for the identically-formatted PCI iommu-map property. Drag the
core parsing routine up yet another layer into the general OF-PCI code,
and further generalise it for either kind of lookup in either flavour
of map property.
