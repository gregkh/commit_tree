packet: call fanout_release, while UNREGISTERING a netdev

If a socket has FANOUT sockopt set, a new proto_hook is registered
as part of fanout_add(). When processing a NETDEV_UNREGISTER event in
af_packet, __fanout_unlink is called for all sockets, but prot_hook which was
registered as part of fanout_add is not removed. Call fanout_release, on a
NETDEV_UNREGISTER, which removes prot_hook and removes fanout from the
fanout_list.

This fixes BUG_ON(!list_empty(&dev->ptype_specific)) in netdev_run_todo()
