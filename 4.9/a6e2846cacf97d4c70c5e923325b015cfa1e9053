bnx2x: Use the correct divisor value for PHC clock readings.

Time Sync (PTP) implementation uses the divisor/shift value for converting
the clock ticks to nanoseconds. Driver currently defines shift value as 1,
this results in the nanoseconds value to be calculated as half the actual
value. Hence the user application fails to synchronize the device clock
value with the PTP master device clock. Need to use the 'shift' value of 0.
