iommu/arm-smmu: Don't inadvertently reject multiple SMMUv3s

We now delay installing our per-bus iommu_ops until we know an SMMU has
successfully probed, as they don't serve much purpose beforehand, and
doing so also avoids fights between multiple IOMMU drivers in a single
kernel. However, the upshot of passing the return value of bus_set_iommu()
back from our probe function is that if there happens to be more than
one SMMUv3 device in a system, the second and subsequent probes will
wind up returning -EBUSY to the driver core and getting torn down again.

Avoid re-setting ops if ours are already installed, so that any genuine
failures stand out.
