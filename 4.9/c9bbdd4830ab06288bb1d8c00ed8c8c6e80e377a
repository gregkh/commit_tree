perf/core: Don't pass PERF_EF_START to the PMU ->start callback

PERF_EF_START is a flag to indicate to the PMU ->add() callback that, as
well as claiming the PMU resources required by the event being added,
it should also start the PMU.

Passing this flag to the ->start() callback doesn't make sense, because
->start() always tries to start the PMU. Remove it.
