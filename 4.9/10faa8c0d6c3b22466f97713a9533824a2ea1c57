crypto: FIPS - allow tests to be disabled in FIPS mode

In FIPS mode, additional restrictions may apply. If these restrictions
are violated, the kernel will panic(). This patch allows test vectors
for symmetric ciphers to be marked as to be skipped in FIPS mode.

Together with the patch, the XTS test vectors where the AES key is
identical to the tweak key is disabled in FIPS mode. This test vector
violates the FIPS requirement that both keys must be different.
