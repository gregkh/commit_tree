brcmfmac: add support for bcm4339 chip with modalias sdio:c00v02D0d4339

The driver already supports the bcm4339 chipset but only for the variant
that shares the same modalias as the bcm4335, ie. sdio:c00v02D0d4335.
It turns out that there are also bcm4339 devices out there that have a
more distiguishable modalias sdio:c00v02D0d4339.
