arm64: sysreg: allow write_sysreg to use XZR

Currently write_sysreg has to allocate a temporary register to write
zero to a system register, which is unfortunate given that the MSR
instruction accepts XZR as an operand.

Allow XZR to be used when appropriate by fiddling with the assembly
constraints.
