scsi: csiostor: Fix completion usage

The (re)initializing of the completion object should be done before we
trigger the transfer. Doing this after triggering the hardware opens up
a race window. Without the timeout we would problaly even deadlock. Use
also reinit_completion because we initalize the whole data structure in
csio_scscim_init().

There is only one waiter for the completion, therefore there is no need
to use complete_all(). Let's make that clear by using complete() instead
of complete_all().

The usage pattern of the completion is:

waiter context                          waker context

csio_eh_abort_handler()
  reinit_completion()
  wait_for_completion_timeout()

                                        csio_scsi_err_handler()
                                          complete()
