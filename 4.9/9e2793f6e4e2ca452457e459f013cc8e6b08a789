drm/i915: compile-time consistency check on __EXEC_OBJECT flags

Two different sets of flag bits are stored in the 'flags' member of a
'struct drm_i915_gem_exec_object2', and they're defined in two different
source files, increasing the risk of an accidental clash.

Some flags in this field are supplied by the user; these are defined in
i915_drm.h, and they start from the LSB and work up.

Other flags are defined in i915_gem_execbuffer, for internal use within
that file only; they start from the MSB and work down.

So here we add a compile-time check that the two sets of flags do not
overlap, which would cause all sorts of confusion.
