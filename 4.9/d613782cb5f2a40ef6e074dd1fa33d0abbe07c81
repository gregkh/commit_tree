clk: sunxi-ng: sun6i-a31: set CLK_SET_RATE_UNGATE for all PLLs

The PLLs have a "lock" bit in their configuration registers which
indicate if the PLL has locked on to the requested clock rate. We
check this bit in the .set_rate op. The PLL cannot lock on if it's
not running, which might be a false positive (warning).

Set the CLK_SET_RATE_UNGATE flag for all PLLs so whenever clk_set_rate
is called on them, they get enabled and the "lock" check is really
checking the PLL.
