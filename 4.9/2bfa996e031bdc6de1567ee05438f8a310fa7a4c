drm/i915: Store owning file on the i915_address_space

For the global GTT (and aliasing GTT), the address space is owned by the
device (it is a global resource) and so the per-file owner field is
NULL. For per-process GTT (where we create an address space per
context), each is owned by the opening file. We can use this ownership
information to both distinguish GGTT and ppGTT address spaces, as well
as occasionally inspect the owner.

v2: Whitespace, tells us who owns i915_address_space
