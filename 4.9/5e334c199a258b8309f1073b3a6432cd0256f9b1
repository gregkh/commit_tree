drm/i915/guc: Consolidate firmware major-minor to one place

Currently to change the firmware one has to update the exported
module firmware string and the major-minor versions used for
verification after load. Consolidate that to a single place
defining correct major and minor versions per platform.

v2: Rebased for KBL.
