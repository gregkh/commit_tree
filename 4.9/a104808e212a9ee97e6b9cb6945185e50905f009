mm: don't emit warning from pagefault_out_of_memory()

Commit c32b3cbe0d06 ("oom, PM: make OOM detection in the freezer path
raceless") inserted a WARN_ON() into pagefault_out_of_memory() in order
to warn when we raced with disabling the OOM killer.

Now, patch "oom, suspend: fix oom_killer_disable vs.  pm suspend
properly" introduced a timeout for oom_killer_disable().  Even if we
raced with disabling the OOM killer and the system is OOM livelocked,
the OOM killer will be enabled eventually (in 20 seconds by default) and
the OOM livelock will be solved.  Therefore, we no longer need to warn
when we raced with disabling the OOM killer.
