mei: amthif: fix request cancel

Currently, all requests cancelled by the user are immediately removed
from the queues. Such removal can cause unexpected behavior in the case
when a request is partially written or a  reply is received after the
request is cancelled.  To resolve this a request is always fully
processed and the result is discarded in case the request was canceled.
This completes the partial fix in commit:
