greybus: fw-download: Replace timer with delayed-work

The timeout-handlers need to call routines that can sleep and those
can't be called from interrupt context. The timer-handler is called in
interrupt context and so will hit a BUG() in vmalloc.c.

This patch moves away from timers to delayed-work, whose timeout handler
gets called in process context and can call the sleep-able routines
safely.

Note that this issue wasn't hit earlier when the initial patch for
timeouts was implemented due to some issues in the build arche_420. But
with the new build arche_440, the BUG started crashing the phone on
timeouts and so this fix is required.

Tested on EVT 1.5 by triggering fake timeouts, by not sending
release-firmware request for example. This is tested with build
arche_440.
