cpufreq / sched: ignore SMT when determining max cpu capacity

PELT does not consider SMT when scaling its utilization values via
arch_scale_cpu_capacity(). The value in rq->cpu_capacity_orig does
take SMT into consideration though and therefore may be smaller than
the utilization reported by PELT.

On an Intel i7-3630QM for example rq->cpu_capacity_orig is 589 but
util_avg scales up to 1024. This means that a 50% utilized CPU will show
up in schedutil as ~86% busy.

Fix this by using the same CPU scaling value in schedutil as that which
is used by PELT.
