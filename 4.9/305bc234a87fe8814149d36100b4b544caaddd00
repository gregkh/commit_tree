drm/i915: Make i915_vma_pin() small and inline

Not only is i915_vma_pin() called for every single object on every single
execbuf, it is usually a simple increment as the VMA is already bound for
execution by the GPU. Rearrange the tests for unbound and pin_count
overflow so that we can do the increment and test very cheaply and
compact enough to inline the operation into execbuf. The trick used is
to note that we can check for an overflow bit (keeping space available
for it inside the flags) at the same time as checking the binding bits.
