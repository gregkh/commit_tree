x86/mce/AMD: Save MCA_IPID in MCE struct on SMCA systems

The MCA_IPID register uniquely identifies a bank's type and instance
on Scalable MCA systems. We should save the value of this register
in struct mce along with the other relevant error information. This
ensures that we can decode errors without relying on system software to
correlate the bank to the type.
