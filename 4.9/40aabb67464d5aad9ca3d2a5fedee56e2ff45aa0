sbitmap: push per-cpu last_tag into sbitmap_queue

Allocating your own per-cpu allocation hint separately makes for an
awkward API. Instead, allocate the per-cpu hint as part of the struct
sbitmap_queue. There's no point for a struct sbitmap_queue without the
cache, but you can still use a bare struct sbitmap.
