xtensa: minimize use of PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MEM_{ADDR,SIZE}

Now that the kernel load address and KSEG physical base address have
their own Kconfig symbols PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MEM seems redundant. It makes
little sense to use it in MMU configurations instead of KSEG_PADDR.
In noMMU configurations there's no explicit KSEG, so it's still useful
for the early cache initialization and definition of ARCH_PFN_OFFSET,
which affects mem_map size.

- limit it to noMMU; MMU variants have XCHAL_KSEG_PADDR and
  XCHAL_KSEG_SIZE;
- don't use it to define TASK_SIZE or MAX_LOW_PFN: first doesn't make
  any difference in noMMU, second is meaningless as there's no high
  memory;
- don't add default physical memory region: memory layout should come
  from the DT, bootloader tags, or memmap= command line parameter.
