zfcp: trace full payload of all SAN records (req,resp,iels)

This was lost with commit 2c55b750a884b86dea8b4cc5f15e1484cc47a25c
("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug tracing for SAN records.")
but is necessary for problem determination, e.g. to see the
currently active zone set during automatic port scan.

For the large GPN_FT response (4 pages), save space by not dumping
any empty residual entries.
