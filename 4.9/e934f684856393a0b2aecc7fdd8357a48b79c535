Revert "hv_netvsc: report vmbus name in ethtool"

This reverts commit e3f74b841d48
("hv_netvsc: report vmbus name in ethtool")'
because of problem introduced by commit f9a56e5d6a0ba
("Drivers: hv: make VMBus bus ids persistent").
This changed the format of the vmbus name and this new format is too
long to fit in the bus_info field of ethtool.
