drm/i915: Nonblocking request submission

Now that we have fences in place to drive request submission, we can
employ those to queue requests after their dependencies as opposed to
stalling in the middle of an execbuf ioctl. (However, we still choose to
spin before enabling the IRQ as that is faster - though contentious.)

v2: Do the fence ordering first, where we can still fail.
