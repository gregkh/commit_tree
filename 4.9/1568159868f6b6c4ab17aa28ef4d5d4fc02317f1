greybus: audio: Update dai_driver table with appropriate fields

Currently, the stream name for the DAI driver is generically set to "GB
Audio Playback" and "GB Audio Capture". This is OK since we use a single
interface on APB1 but that could change in the future.  Update the DAI
driver table entries to properly reflect the interface used.
