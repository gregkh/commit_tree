NFS: direct: use complete() instead of complete_all()

There is only one waiter for the completion, therefore there
is no need to use complete_all(). Let's make that clear by
using complete() instead of complete_all().

nfs_file_direct_write() or nfs_file_direct_read() allocated a request
object via nfs_direct_req_alloc(), which initializes the
completion. The request object then is freed later in the exit path.
Between the initialization and the release either
nfs_direct_write_schedule_iovec() resp
nfs_direct_read_schedule_iovec() are called which will asynchronously
process the request. The calling function waits via nfs_direct_wait()
till the async work has been done. Thus there is only one waiter on
the completion.

nfs_direct_pgio_init() and nfs_direct_read_completion() are passed via
function pointers to nfs pageio. The first function does a ref
counting (get_dreq() and put_dreq()) which ensures that
nfs_direct_read_completion() and nfs_direct_read_schedule_iovec() only
call the completion path once.

The usage pattern of the completion is:

waiter context                          waker context

nfs_file_direct_write()
  dreq = nfs_direct_req_alloc()
    init_completion()
  nfs_direct_write_schedule_iovec()
  nfs_direct_wait()
    wait_for_completion_killable()

                                        nfs_direct_write_schedule_work()
                                          nfs_direct_complete()
                                            complete()

nfs_file_direct_read()
  dreq = nfs_direct_req_all()
    init_completion()
  nfs_direct_read_schedule_iovec()
  nfs_direct_wait()
    wait_for_completion_killable()
                                        nfs_direct_read_schedule_iovec()
                                          nfs_direct_complete()
                                            complete()

                                        nfs_direct_read_completion()
                                          nfs_direct_complete()
                                            complete()
