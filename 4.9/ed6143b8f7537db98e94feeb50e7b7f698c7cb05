drm/i915/lvds: Restore initial HW state during encoder enabling

Atm the LVDS encoder depends on the PPS HW context being saved/restored
from generic suspend/resume code. Since the PPS is specific to the LVDS
and eDP encoders a cleaner way is to reinitialize it during encoder
enabling, so do this here for LVDS. Follow-up patches will init the PPS
for the eDP encoder similarly and remove the suspend/resume time save /
restore.

v2:
- Apply BSpec +1 offset and use DIV_ROUND_UP() when programming the
power cycle delay. (Ville)
v3: (Ville)
- Fix +1 vs. round-up order.
- s/reset_on_powerdown/powerdown_on_reset/
