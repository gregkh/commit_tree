qed: Add support for legacy VFs

The 8.10.x FW added support for forward compatability as well as
'future' backward compatibility, but only to those VFs that were
using HSI which was 8.10.x based or newer.

The latest firmware now supports backward compatibility for the
older VFs based on 8.7.x and 8.8.x firmware as well.
