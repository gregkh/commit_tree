greybus: gbphy: fix compile error with CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME disabled

gb_phy runtime functions use struct gbphy_device *gbphy_dev,
and not struct device. When CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is not enabled
a compile error will show.

Fix this by passing struct gbphy_device * as parameter

Testing Done: compile with CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME disabled
