staging/lustre/o2iblnd: handle mixed page size configurations.

Currently it is not possible to send LNet traffic between
two nodes using infiniband hardware that have different
page sizes for the case when RDMA fragments are used.
When two nodes establish a connection they tell the other
node the maximum number of RDMA fragments they support.
The issue is that the units are pages, and 256 64K pages
corresponds to 16MB of data, whereas a 4K page system is
limited to messages with 1MB of data. The solution is to
report over the wire the maximum number of fragments in
4K unites regardless of the native page size. The recipient
then uses its native page size to translate into the
maximum number of pages sized fragments it can send to
the other node.
