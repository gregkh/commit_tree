ARCv2: MCIP: Use IDU_M_DISTRI_DEST mode if there is only 1 destination core

ARC linux uses 2 distribution modes for common interrupts: round robin
mode (IDU_M_DISTRI_RR) and a simple destination mode (IDU_M_DISTRI_DEST).
The first one is used when more than 1 cores may handle a common interrupt
and the second one is used when only 1 core may handle a common interrupt.

However idu_irq_set_affinity() always sets IDU_M_DISTRI_RR for all affinity
values. But there is no sense in setting of such mode if only 1 core must
handle a common interrupt.
