greybus: audio: Use greybus connection device for codec registration

Use GB Audio mgmt, data protocol ids to register codec module with
GB protocol. And in response to mgmt->connection_init(), register
GB codec driver with ASoC.

Now, using msm8994  machine to register DAI link dynamically on
codec insertion.

ToDos:
- snd_soc_register_codec() uses driver->name to identify device id.
  However, for GB device, .driver{} is not yet populated by GB core.
  Thus, defining dummy structure within codec driver. This should
  come from GB core itself.
  Even existing .driver{} may cause problem in case of multiple
  modules inserted or inserted at a different slot.
- Fix logic for gbcodec->dais & gbcodec->dailinks. Current
  implementation contains some hard coded data with assumption of
  count=1.
- Evaluate definition of 'gbaudio_dailink.be_id' in case of multiple
  DAI links.
