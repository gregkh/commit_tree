[media] pulse8-cec: store logical address mask

In addition to setting the ACK mask, also set the logical address mask
setting in the dongle. This (and not the ACK mask) is persisted for
use in autonomous mode.

The logical address mask to use is deduced from the primary device type
in adap->log_addrs.
