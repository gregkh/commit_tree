fm10k: don't continue probe if PCI device not in normal IO state

In the event of an uncorrectable AER error occurring when the driver has
not loaded, the recovery routines are not done. This is done because
future loads of the driver may not be aware of the IO state and may not
be able to recover at all. In this case, when we next load the driver it
fails due to what appears to be a surprise remove event. Instead, add
a check to ensure that the device is in the normal IO state before
continuing to probe. This allows us to give a more descriptive message
of what is wrong.

Without this change, the driver will attempt to probe up to our first
call of .reset_hw() which will be unable to read registers and act as if
a surprise remove event occurred.
