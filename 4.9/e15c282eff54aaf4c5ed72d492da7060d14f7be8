ALSA: bebob: unify configurations for some models produced by Yamaha/Terratec

The below models were developed with a cooperation by Yamaha and Terratec.
 - Yamaha GO 44/Terratec PHASE 24 FW
 - Yamaha GO 46/Terratec PHASE X24 FW

They have the same configurations, thus it's better to unify corresponding
codes.

This commit merges them to reduce the amount of maintained codes.
