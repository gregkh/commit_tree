ftrace: Add more checks for FTRACE_FL_DISABLED in processing ip records

When a module is first loaded and its function ip records are added to the
ftrace list of functions to modify, they are set to DISABLED, as their text
is still in a read only state. When the module is fully loaded, and can be
updated, the flag is cleared, and if their's any functions that should be
tracing them, it is updated at that moment.

But there's several locations that do record accounting and should ignore
records that are marked as disabled, or they can cause issues.

Alexei already fixed one location, but others need to be addressed.
