clk: imx7d: do not set the parent of IMX7D_ENET_AXI_ROOT_SRC

Booting the kernel on a imx7s-warp leads to several warnings like these:

This fix is along the same lines as 5e33ebff7edd ("clk: imx7d: do not
set parent of ethernet time/ref clocks") and the explanation from that
commit is:

"The reason for the warning is that setting the parent enables the ENET
 PLL since we are using CLK_OPS_PARENT_ENABLE. Enabling the ENET PLL can
 cause clk_pllv3_wait_lock to sleep. See also:
 commit fc8726a2c021 ("clk: core: support clocks which requires parents
 enable (part 2)")."

imx7s-warp does not even use the FEC interface, so we should not really
configure the parent of IMX7D_ENET_AXI_ROOT_SRC in the common MX7 clock
driver code.

The dts file should use the assigned-clocks/assigned-clock-parents method,
so simply remove the configuration of IMX7D_ENET_AXI_ROOT_SRC parent.
