perf/x86/intel/uncore: Remove hard-coded implementation for Node ID mapping location

The method to build PCI bus to socket mapping is similar among
platforms. However, the PCI location which stores Node ID mapping could
vary between different platforms. For example, the Node ID mapping address
on Skylake server is different from the previous platform. Also, to
build the mapping for the PCI bus without UBOX, it has to start from
bus 0 on Skylake server.

This patch removes the current hardcoded implementation and adds
three parameters for snbep_pci2phy_map_init(). This way the Node ID mapping
address and bus searching direction can be configured according to
different platforms.
