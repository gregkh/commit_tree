greybus: some more renames

This patch renames of symbols, for better clarity and consistency.

    cport -> cport_id (when it represents a cport *number*)
    send_svc_msg -> submit_svc (like submit_gbuf)
    greybus_cport_in_data -> greybus_cport_in
    gb_new_ap_msg -> greybus_svc_in (like greybus_cport_in)
    cport->number -> cport->id (like cport_id)

Making the svc and cport message stuff more similar is done with an
eye toward having SVC messages and messages exchanged with other
modules use some more common communication mechanisms.
