xfs: move mappings from cow fork to data fork after copy-write

After the write component of a copy-write operation finishes, clean up
the bookkeeping left behind.  On error, we simply free the new blocks
and pass the error up.  If we succeed, however, then we must remove
the old data fork mapping and move the cow fork mapping to the data
fork.
