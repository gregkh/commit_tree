scsi: ibmvfc: Fix I/O hang when port is not mapped

If a VFC port gets unmapped in the VIOS, it may not respond with a CRQ
init complete following H_REG_CRQ. If this occurs, we can end up having
called scsi_block_requests and not a resulting unblock until the init
complete happens, which may never occur, and we end up hanging I/O
requests.  This patch ensures the host action stay set to
IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_TGT_DEL so we move all rports into devloss state and
unblock unless we receive an init complete.
