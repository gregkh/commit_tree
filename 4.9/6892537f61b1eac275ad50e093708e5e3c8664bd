greybus: move ap_disconnect()

The next patch has ap_probe() reference ap_disconnect().  To prepare
for that, move ap_disconnect() up in the file.

This is done as a separate commit to make it easier to see this move
involves no other change to that function.  This and the next commit
can be squashed if desired.
