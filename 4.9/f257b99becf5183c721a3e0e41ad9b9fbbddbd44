batman-adv: Place kref_get for orig_ifinfo near use

It is hard to understand why the refcnt is increased when it isn't done
near the actual place the new reference is used. So using kref_get right
before the place which requires the reference and in the same function
helps to avoid accidental problems caused by incorrect reference counting.
