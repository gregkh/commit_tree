Staging: octeon: Add missing of_node_put after calling of_parse_phandle.

of_node_put needs to be called when the device node which is got
from of_parse_phandle is no longer used.
This patch is found by below coccinelle script:

@@
expression e,e1,e2;
@@
*e = of_parse_phandle(...)
... when != of_node_put(e)
    when != true e == NULL
    when != e2 = e
e = e1
