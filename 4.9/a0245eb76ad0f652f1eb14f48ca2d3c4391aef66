clk: mvebu: dynamically allocate resources in Armada CP110 system controller

Original commit, which added support for Armada CP110 system controller
used global variables for storing all clock information. It worked
fine for Armada 7k SoC, with single CP110 block. After dual-CP110 Armada 8k
was introduced, the data got overwritten and corrupted.

This patch fixes the issue by allocating resources dynamically in the
driver probe and storing it as platform drvdata.
