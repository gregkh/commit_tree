greybus: uart: s/REQ/TYPE

Request type for all other protocols is defined like: GB_<protocol>_TYPE_<operation>,
but for UART is like: GB_<protocol>_REQ_<operation>.

Replace REQ with TYPE to make it consistent. It will also be useful in a later
patch that creates get_version() routines with the help of a macro.
