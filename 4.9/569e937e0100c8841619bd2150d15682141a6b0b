mISDN: mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:

drivers/isdn/hardware/mISDN/hfcmulti.c:574:1: warning: no previous declaration for 'disablepcibridge' [-Wmissing-declarations]

....

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
