staging: r8188eu: Fix scheduling while atomic splat

Commit fadbe0cd5292851608e2e01b91d9295fa287b9fe ("staging: rtl8188eu:
Remove rtw_zmalloc(), wrapper for kzalloc()") changed all allocation
calls to be GFP_KERNEL even though the original wrapper was testing
to determine if the caller was in atomic mode. Most of the mistakes
were corrected with commit 33dc85c3c667209c930b2dac5ccbc2a365e06b7a
("staging: r8188eu: Fix scheduling while atomic error introduced in
commit fadbe0cd"); however, two kzalloc calls were missed as the
call only happens when the driver is shutting down.
