drm/i915: Account for TSEG size when determining 865G stolen base

Looks like the TSEG lives just above TOUD, stolen comes after TSEG.

The spec seems somewhat self-contradictory in places, in the ESMRAMC
register desctription it says:
 TSEG Size:
  10=(TOUD + 512 KB) to TOUD
  11 =(TOUD + 1 MB) to TOUD

so that agrees with TSEG being at TOUD. But the example given
elsehwere in the spec says:

 TOUD equals 62.5 MB = 03E7FFFFh
 TSEG selected as 512 KB in size,
 Graphics local memory selected as 1 MB in size
 General System RAM available in system = 62.5 MB
 General system RAM range00000000h to 03E7FFFFh
 TSEG address range03F80000h to 03FFFFFFh
 TSEG pre-allocated from03F80000h to 03FFFFFFh
 Graphics local memory pre-allocated from03E80000h to 03F7FFFFh

so here we have TSEG above stolen.

Real world evidence agrees with the TOUD->TSEG->stolen order however, so
let's fix up the code to account for the TSEG size.
