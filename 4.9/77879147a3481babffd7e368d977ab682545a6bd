net_sched: sch_fq: add low_rate_threshold parameter

This commit adds to the fq module a low_rate_threshold parameter to
insert a delay after all packets if the socket requests a pacing rate
below the threshold.

This helps achieve more precise control of the sending rate with
low-rate paths, especially policers. The basic issue is that if a
congestion control module detects a policer at a certain rate, it may
want fq to be able to shape to that policed rate. That way the sender
can avoid policer drops by having the packets arrive at the policer at
or just under the policed rate.

The default threshold of 550Kbps was chosen analytically so that for
policers or links at 500Kbps or 512Kbps fq would very likely invoke
this mechanism, even if the pacing rate was briefly slightly above the
available bandwidth. This value was then empirically validated with
two years of production testing on YouTube video servers.
