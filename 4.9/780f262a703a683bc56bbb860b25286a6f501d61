drm/i915: Replace wait-on-mutex with wait-on-bit in reset worker

Since we have a cooperative mode now with a direct reset, we can avoid
the contention on struct_mutex and instead try then sleep on the
I915_RESET_IN_PROGRESS bit. If the mutex is held and that bit is
cleared, all is fine. Otherwise, we sleep for a bit and try again. In
the worst case we sleep for an extra second waiting for the mutex to be
released (no one touching the GPU is allowed the struct_mutex whilst the
I915_RESET_IN_PROGRESS bit is set). But when we have a direct reset,
this allows us to clean up the reset worker faster.

v2: Remember to call wake_up_bit() after changing (for the faster wakeup
as promised)
