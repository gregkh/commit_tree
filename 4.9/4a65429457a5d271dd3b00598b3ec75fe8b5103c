s390/mm: fix zone calculation in arch_add_memory()

Standby (hotplug) memory should be added to ZONE_MOVABLE on s390. After
commit 199071f1 "s390/mm: make arch_add_memory() NUMA aware",
arch_add_memory() used memblock_end_of_DRAM() to find out the end of
ZONE_NORMAL and the beginning of ZONE_MOVABLE. However, commit 7f36e3e5
"memory-hotplug: add hot-added memory ranges to memblock before allocate
node_data for a node." moved the call of memblock_add_node() before
the call of arch_add_memory() in add_memory_resource(), and thus changed
the return value of memblock_end_of_DRAM() when called in
arch_add_memory(). As a result, arch_add_memory() will think that all
memory blocks should be added to ZONE_NORMAL.

Fix this by changing the logic in arch_add_memory() so that it will
manually iterate over all zones of a given node to find out which zone
a memory block should be added to.
