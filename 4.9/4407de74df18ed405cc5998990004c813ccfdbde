pstore/ramoops: fixup driver removal

A basic rmmod ramoops segfaults. Let's see why.

Since commit 34f0ec82e0a9 ("pstore: Correct the max_dump_cnt clearing of
ramoops") sets ->max_dump_cnt to zero before looping over ->przs but we
didn't use it before that either.

And since commit ee1d267423a1 ("pstore: add pstore unregister") we free
that memory on rmmod.

But even then, we looped until a NULL pointer or ERR. I don't see where
it is ensured that the last member is NULL. Let's try this instead:
simply error recovery and free. Clean up in error case where resources
were allocated. And then, in the free path, rely on ->max_dump_cnt in
the free path.
