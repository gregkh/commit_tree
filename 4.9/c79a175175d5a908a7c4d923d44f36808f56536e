Btrfs: fix memory leak of block group cache

While processing delayed refs, we may update block group's statistics
and attach it to cur_trans->dirty_bgs, and later writing dirty block
groups will process the list, which happens during
btrfs_commit_transaction().

For whatever reason, the transaction is aborted and dirty_bgs
is not processed in cleanup_transaction(), we end up with memory leak
of these dirty block group cache.

Since btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups() doesn't make it go to the commit
critical section, this also adds the cleanup work inside it.
