greybus: fix request timeout bug

This commit changed the timeout behavior for operations:
    6a8732e operation: make the timeout a per-operation thing...

It unfortunately left in place some code that was only
appropriate for per-connection timeouts.  In particular,
the timer for an operation is currently getting started
only if no existing operations are in flight.

Fix that oversight, and schedule an operation's timer
unconditionally.
