wil6210: fix protection of wil->scan_request

Currently the places that check wil->scan_request and
call cfg80211_scan_done are not consistently protected,
so there is a risk that cfg80211_scan_done will be called
with NULL scan_request, causing a kernel crash.
Fix this by using p2p_wdev_mutex in few other places
that access scan_request. This makes sense since
scan_request may point to p2p_wdev, and it is not worth
the extra complexity of adding a new mutex.
