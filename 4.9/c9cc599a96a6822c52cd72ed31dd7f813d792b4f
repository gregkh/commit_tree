net/mlx4_core: Fix QUERY FUNC CAP flags

Separate QUERY_FUNC_CAP flags0 from QUERY_FUNC_CAP flags, as 'flags' is
already used for another set of flags in FUNC CAP, while phv bit should be
part of a different set of flags.
Remove QUERY_FUNC_CAP port_flags field, as it is not in use.

Fixes: 5cc914f10851 ('mlx4_core: Added FW commands and their wrappers for supporting SRIOV')
