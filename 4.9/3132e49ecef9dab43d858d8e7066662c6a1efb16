pnfs: track multiple layout types in fsinfo structure

Current NFSv4.1/pNFS client assumes that MDS supports only one layout
type. While it's true for most existing servers, nevertheless, this can
be change in the near future.

For now, this patch just plumbs in the ability to track a list of
layouts in the fsinfo structure. The existing behavior of the client
is preserved, by having it just select the first entry in the list.
