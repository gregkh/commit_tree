greybus: operation: fix unaligned memory accesses in receive path

The buffer received from our current host driver is 1-byte aligned and
will therefore cause unaligned memory accesses if simply cast to an
operation-message header.

Fix this by making a properly aligned copy of the header in
gb_connection_recv_response before accessing its fields.

Note that this does not affect protocol drivers as the whole buffer is
copied when creating the corresponding request or response before being
forwarded.
