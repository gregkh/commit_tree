pinctrl: amlogic: gxbb: add nand pins

Add EE domains pins for the NAND flash controller.
Even tough we have no driver for the NAND flash controller yet, we need
to have these pins in pinctrl as the actual pin are shared with the spifc
controller. The bootloader on the S905-P200 setup pinmux for the NAND
controller so we need the kernel to properly deactivate this if necessary.
