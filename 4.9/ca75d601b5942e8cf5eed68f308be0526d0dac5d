miscdevice: Add helper macro for misc device boilerplate

Many modules call misc_register and misc_deregister in its module init
and exit methods without any additional code. This ends up being
boilerplate. This patch adds helper macro module_misc_device(), that
replaces module_init()/ module_exit() with template functions.

This patch also converts drivers to use new macro.

Change since v1:
Add device.h include in miscdevice.h as module_driver macro was not
available from other include files in some architectures.
