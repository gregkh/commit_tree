ARM: KVM: Support vgic-v3

This patch allows to build and use vgic-v3 in 32-bit mode.

Unfortunately, it can not be split in several steps without extra
stubs to keep patches independent and bisectable.  For instance,
virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-v3.c uses function from vgic-v3-sr.c, handling
access to GICv3 cpu interface from the guest requires vgic_v3.vgic_sre
to be already defined.

It is how support has been done:

* handle SGI requests from the guest

* report configured SRE on access to GICv3 cpu interface from the guest

* required vgic-v3 macros are provided via uapi.h

* static keys are used to select GIC backend

* to make vgic-v3 build KVM_ARM_VGIC_V3 guard is removed along with
  the static inlines
