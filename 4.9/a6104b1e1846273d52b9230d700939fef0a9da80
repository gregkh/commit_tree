scsi: ibmvfc: add FC Class 3 Error Recovery support

The ibmvfc driver currently doesn't support FC Class 3 Error Recovery.
However, it is simply a matter of informing the VIOS that the payload
expects to use sequence level error recovery via a bit flag in the
ibmvfc_cmd structure.

This patch adds a module parameter to enable error recovery support at
boot time. When enabled the RETRY service parameter bit is set during
PRLI, and ibmvfc_cmd->flags includes the IBMVFC_CLASS_3_ERR bit.
