greybus: interface: retry enumeration of UniPro-only modules

Greybus modules will sometimes fail to send the mailbox poke and
erroneously be enumerated as UniPro-only modules. The root cause for
this on the module side is not fully understand, but it seems that this
may be due to "the bootrom bug:" a known problem with the bootrom where
linkup will occasionally fail because of a race condition.

Before the new hotplug code was implemented in the firmware, the SVC
would retry enumeration of modules that did not send the mailbox poke;
this patch ports that functionality to the AP.
