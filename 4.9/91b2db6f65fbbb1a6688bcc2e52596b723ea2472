drm/i915: Pad GTT views of exec objects up to user specified size

Our GPUs impose certain requirements upon buffers that depend upon how
exactly they are used. Typically this is expressed as that they require
a larger surface than would be naively computed by pitch * height.
Normally such requirements are hidden away in the userspace driver, but
when we accept pointers from strangers and later impose extra conditions
on them, the original client allocator has no idea about the
monstrosities in the GPU and we require the userspace driver to inform
the kernel how many padding pages are required beyond the client
allocation.

v2: Long time, no see
v3: Try an anonymous union for uapi struct compatibility
