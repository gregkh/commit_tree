debugfs: introduce a public file_operations accessor

This patch introduces an accessor which can be used
by the users of debugfs (drivers, fs, ...) to get the
original file_operations struct. It also removes the
REAL_FOPS_DEREF macro in file.c and converts the code
to use the public version.

Previously, REAL_FOPS_DEREF was only available within
the file.c of debugfs. But having a public getter
available for debugfs users is important as some
drivers (carl9170 and b43) use the pointer of the
original file_operations in conjunction with container_of()
within their debugfs implementations.
