score: traps: Add missing include file to fix build error

score images fail to build as follows.

arch/score/kernel/traps.c: In function 'show_stack':
arch/score/kernel/traps.c:55:3: error:
	implicit declaration of function '__get_user'

__get_user() is declared in asm/uaccess.h, which was previously included
through asm/module.h.
