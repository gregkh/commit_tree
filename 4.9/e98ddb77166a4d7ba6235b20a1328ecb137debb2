powerpc/powernv/eeh: Skip finding bus for VF resets

When the PE used in pnv_eeh_reset() is that of a VF,
pnv_eeh_reset_vf_pe() is used.  Unlike the other reset functions called
in pnv_eeh_reset(), the VF reset doesn't require a bus, and if a bus was
missing the function would error out before resetting the VF PE.

To avoid this, reorder the VF reset function to occur before finding and
checking the bus.
