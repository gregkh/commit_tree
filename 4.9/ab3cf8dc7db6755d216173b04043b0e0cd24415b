greybus: enforce max representable message size

We represent the size of a message using a 16-bit field.  It's
possible for a host driver to advertise a maximum message size
that's bigger than that.  If that happens, reduce the host device's
maximum buffer size to the maximum we can represent the first time
a message is allocated.

This information is actually only used by the Greybus code, but
because we're modifying a value that's "owned" by the host driver,
issue a warning when this limit is being imposed

Ensure (at build time) that our own definition is sane as well.
