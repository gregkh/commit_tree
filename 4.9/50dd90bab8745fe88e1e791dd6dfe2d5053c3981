staging: lustre: llite: add LL_LEASE_{RD,WR,UN}LCK

Define new constants LL_LEASE_{RD,WR,UN}LCK for use as the argument to
and return value from the LL_IOC_{GET,SET}_LEASE ioctls. As arguments,
these contants replace the use of F_{RD,WR,UN}LCK from fcntl.h. As
return values they replace the use of FMODE_{READ,WRITE} which are
internal to the Linux kernel source and not under the control of the
Lustre ioctl interface.
