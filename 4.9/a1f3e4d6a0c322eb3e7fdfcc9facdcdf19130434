libnvdimm, region: update nd_region_available_dpa() for multi-pmem support

The free dpa (dimm-physical-address) space calculation reports how much
free space is available with consideration for aliased BLK + PMEM
regions.  Recall that BLK capacity is allocated from high addresses and
PMEM is allocated from low addresses in their respective regions.

nd_region_available_dpa() accounts for the fact that the largest
encroachment (lowest starting address) into PMEM capacity by a BLK
allocation limits the available capacity to that point, regardless if
there is BLK allocation hole at a higher address.  Similarly, for the
multi-pmem case we need to track the largest encroachment (highest
 ending address) of a PMEM allocation in BLK capacity regardless of
whether there is an allocation hole that a BLK allocation could fill at
a lower address.
