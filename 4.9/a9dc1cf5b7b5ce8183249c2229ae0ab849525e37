greybus: hd/es2: add cport_connected callback and ARPC

Add a host-device cport_connected callback, which will be called after a
connection has been created and that can be used by the host-device
driver to make sure its internal state is updated to match the CPort
attributes set by the SVC.

This callback will eventually replace the cport_features_enable
callback.
