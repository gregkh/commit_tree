crypto: mv_cesa - remove NO_IRQ reference

Drivers should not use NO_IRQ, as we are trying to get rid of that.
In this case, the call to irq_of_parse_and_map() is both wrong
(as it returns '0' on failure, not NO_IRQ) and unnecessary
(as platform_get_irq() does the same thing)

This removes the call to irq_of_parse_and_map() and checks for
the error code correctly.
