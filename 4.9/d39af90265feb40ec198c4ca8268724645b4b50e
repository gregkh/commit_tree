xtensa: add alternative kernel memory layouts

MMUv3 is able to support low memory bigger than 128MB.
Implement 256MB and 512MB KSEG layouts:

- add Kconfig selector for KSEG layout;
- add KSEG base address, size and alignment definitions to
  arch/xtensa/include/asm/kmem_layout.h;
- use new definitions in TLB initialization;
- add build time memory map consistency checks.

See Documentation/xtensa/mmu.txt for the details of new memory layouts.
