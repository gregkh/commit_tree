mtd: nand: Error out if cmd_ctrl() is missing

If no user specified chip->select_chip() function is provided, code in
nand_base.c will automatically set this hook to nand_select_chip(),
which in turn depends on chip->cmd_ctrl() hook being valid. Not
providing both of those functions in NAND controller driver (for example
by mistake) will result in a bit cryptic segfault. Same is true for
chip->cmdfunc().

To avoid the above scenario add a check in nand_scan_dent and error out
if cmd_ctrl() is not provided.
