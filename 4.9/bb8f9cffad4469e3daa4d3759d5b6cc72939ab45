drm/i915: Allow DMA pagetables to use highmem

As we never need to directly access the pages we allocate for scratch and
the pagetables, and always remap them into the GTT through the dma
remapper, we do not need to limit the allocations to lowmem i.e. we can
pass in the __GFP_HIGHMEM flag to the page allocation.

For backwards compatibility, e.g. certain old GPUs not liking highmem
for certain functions that may be accidentally mapped to the scratch
page by userspace, keep the GMCH probe as only allocating from DMA32.
