netfilter: conntrack: resched gc again if eviction rate is high

If we evicted a large fraction of the scanned conntrack entries re-schedule
the next gc cycle for immediate execution.

This triggers during tests where load is high, then drops to zero and
many connections will be in TW/CLOSE state with < 30 second timeouts.

Without this change it will take several minutes until conntrack count
comes back to normal.
