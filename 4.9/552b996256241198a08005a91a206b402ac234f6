i40e: use configured RSS key and lookup table in i40e_vsi_config_rss

A previous refactor added support to store user configuration for VSIs,
so that extra VSIs such as for VMDq can use this information when
configuring. Unfortunately the i40e_vsi_config_rss function was missed
in this refactor, and the values were being ignored. Fix this by
checking for the fields and using those instead of always using the
default values.
