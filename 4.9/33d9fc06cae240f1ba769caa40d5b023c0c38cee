dts: sun8i-h3: associate exposed UARTs on Orange Pi Boards

These H3 boards all expose UART1-3 on their expansion header. Since
other functions can be muxed to these pins, they are explicitly
disabled. To enable them, one could use DT overlays or U-boot commands:

 => fdt set /soc/serial@01c28c00 status okay
