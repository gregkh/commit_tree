ASoC: rsrc-card: remove board specific compatible

rsrc-card has board specific compatible (= lager/koelsh), but these were
created as 1st prototype, and it is used in my test environment only.
Now normal user can use generic compatible (= renesas,rsrc-card).
Removing these board specific compatible doesn't breake compatibility.
This patch remove these.
