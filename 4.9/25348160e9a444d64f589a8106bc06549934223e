video: ARM CLCD: add special panel hook for Versatiles

This adds a special panel init hook for the ARM reference designs
Integrator (IM-PD1), Versatile and RealView, so we can configure
a DPI panel from device tree and have it working without
boardfiles for these machines.

Basically this is the same code as from the board files, just
moved over to look up the syscon DT node and manipulate the
special CLCD register from their regmap.

Tested on RealView PB11MPcore.
