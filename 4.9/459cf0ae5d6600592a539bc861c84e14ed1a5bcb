checkpatch: improve the octal permissions tests

The function calls with octal permissions commonly span multiple lines.
The current test is line oriented and fails to find some matches.

Make the test use the $stat variable instead of the $line variable to span
multiple lines.

Also add a few functions to the known functions with permissions list.

Move the SYMBOLIC_PERMS test to a separate section to find all the S_<FOO>
permissions in any form not just those that have specific function names.

This can now find and fix permissions uses like:
     .mode = S_<FOO> | S_<BAR>;
