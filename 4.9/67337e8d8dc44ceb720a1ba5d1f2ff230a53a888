coresight: Add better messages for coresight_timeout

When we encounter a timeout waiting for a status change via
coresight_timeout, the caller always print the offset which
was tried. This is pretty much useless as it doesn't specify
the bit position we wait for. Also, one needs to lookup the
TRM to figure out, what was wrong. This patch changes all
such error messages to print something more meaningful.
