ALSA: seq: add documentation for snd_seq_kernel_client_ctl

This kernel API is used by kernel implementation. Currently, it's used for
kernel clients of ALSA sequencer, while it can be used for application
clients. The difference is just on address spaces of argument. In short,
this kernel API can be available for application client with data in kernel
space.

This commit adds a document about this.
