drivers/tty: Explicitly pass current to show_stack

As noted in commit:

  81539169f283329f ("x86/dumpstack: Remove NULL task pointer convention")

... having a NULL task parameter imply current leads to subtle bugs in stack
walking code (so far seen on both 86 and arm64), makes callsites harder to
read, and is unnecessary as all callers have access to current.

As a step towards removing the problematic NULL-implies-current idiom entirely,
have the sysrq code explicitly pass current to show_stack.
