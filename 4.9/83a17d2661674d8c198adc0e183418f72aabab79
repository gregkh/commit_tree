sparc64: Prepare to move to more saner user copy exception handling.

The fixup helper function mechanism for handling user copy fault
handling is not %100 accurrate, and can never be made so.

We are going to transition the code to return the running return
return length, which is always kept track in one or more registers
of each of these routines.

In order to convert them one by one, we have to allow the existing
behavior to continue functioning.

Therefore make all the copy code that wants the fixup helper to be
used return negative one.

After all of the user copy routines have been converted, this logic
and the fixup helpers themselves can be removed completely.
