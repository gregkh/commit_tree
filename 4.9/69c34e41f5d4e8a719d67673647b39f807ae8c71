drm/rockchip: vop: export line flag function

VOP have integrated a hardware counter which indicate the exact display
line that vop is scanning. And if we're interested in a specific line,
we can set the line number to vop line_flag register, and then vop would
generate a line_flag interrupt for it.

For example eDP PSR function is interested in the vertical blanking
period, then driver could set the line number to zero.

This patch have exported a symbol that allow other driver to listen the
line flag event with given timeout limit:
-  rockchip_drm_wait_line_flag()
