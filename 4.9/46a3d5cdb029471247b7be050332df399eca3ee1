coresight: etm4x: request to retain power to the trace unit when active

The Coresight ETMv4 architecture provides a way to request to keep the
power to the trace unit. This might help to collect the traces without
the need to disable the CPU power management(entering/exiting deeper
idle states).

Trace PowerDown Control Register provides powerup request bit which when
set requests the system to retain power to the trace unit and emulate
the powerdown request.

Typically, a trace unit drives a signal to the power controller to
request that the trace unit core power domain is powered up. However,
if the trace unit and the CPU are in the same power domain then the
implementation might combine the trace unit power up status with a
signal from the CPU.

This patch requests to retain power to the trace unit when active and
to remove when inactive. Note this change will only request but the
behaviour depends on the implementation. However, it matches the
exact behaviour expected when the external debugger is connected with
respect to CPU power states.
