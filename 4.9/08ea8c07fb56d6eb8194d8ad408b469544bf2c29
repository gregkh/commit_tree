mm: move phys_mem_access_prot_allowed() declaration to pgtable.h

We get 1 warning when building kernel with W=1:

  drivers/char/mem.c:220:12: warning: no previous prototype for 'phys_mem_access_prot_allowed' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
   int __weak phys_mem_access_prot_allowed(struct file *file,

In fact, its declaration is spreading to several header files in
different architecture, but need to be declare in common header file.

So this patch moves phys_mem_access_prot_allowed() to pgtable.h.
