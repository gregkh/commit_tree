i40e: Split Flow Director descriptor config into separate function

In an effort to improve code readability I am splitting the Flow Director
filter configuration out into a separate function like we have done for the
standard xmit path.  The general idea is to provide a single block of code
that translates the flow specification into a proper Flow Director
descriptor.
