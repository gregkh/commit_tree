fm10k: don't try to stop queues if we've lost hw_addr

In the event of a surprise remove, we expect the driver to go down,
which includes calling .stop_hw(). However, this function will return an
error because the queues won't appear to cleanly disable. Prevent this
and avoid the unnecessary checks by just returning when
FM10K_REMOVED(hw->hw_addr) is true.
