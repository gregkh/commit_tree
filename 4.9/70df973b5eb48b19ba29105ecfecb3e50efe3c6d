i40e: Force register writes to mitigate sync issues with iwarp VF driver

This patch is a fix for the bug i.e. unable to create iwarp device
in VF. This is a sync issue and the iwarp device open is called even
before the PCI register writes are done.

Forcing the PCI register writes to happen just before it exits the
function.
