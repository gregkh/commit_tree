drivers/perf: arm_pmu: add common attr group fields

In preparation for adding common attribute groups, add an array of
attribute group pointers to arm_pmu, which will be used if the
backend hasn't already set pmu::attr_groups.

Subsequent patches will move backends over to using these, before adding
common fields.
