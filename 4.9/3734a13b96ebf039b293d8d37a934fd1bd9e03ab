pipe: refactor argument for account_pipe_buffers()

This is a preparatory patch for following work. account_pipe_buffers()
performs accounting in the 'user_struct'. There is no need to pass a
pointer to a 'pipe_inode_info' struct (which is then dereferenced to
obtain a pointer to the 'user' field). Instead, pass a pointer directly
to the 'user_struct'. This change is needed in preparation for a
subsequent patch that the fixes the limit checking in alloc_pipe_info()
(and the resulting code is a little more logical).
