greybus: core: avoid I/O to disconnected interfaces

Add new helper to disable connections to interfaces that have already
been disconnected (e.g. forcibly removed).

The connection tear-down procedure differs enough depending on whether
the interface is still present or already gone to warrant a dedicated
helper. This will become more obvious with the new tear-down procedure,
which involves I/O on the connection being tore down.

This also simplifies handling of the legacy bootrom, which does not
support the new tear-down operations.

Specifically, this allows us to remove the early control-connection
tear down during interface disable, and also avoids some error messages
currently printed during legacy mode switch (i.e. bootrom
boot-over-UniPro) and forcible removal.
