iio: ad5755: fix off-by-one on devnr limit check

The comparison for devnr limits is off-by-one, the current check
allows 0 to AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS and the limit should be in fact
0 to AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS - 1.  This can lead to an out of bounds
write to pdata->dac[devnr]. Fix this by replacing > with >= on the
comparison.
