rxrpc: Fix accidental cancellation of scheduled resend by ACK parser

When rxrpc_input_soft_acks() is parsing the soft-ACKs from an ACK packet,
it updates the Tx packet annotations in the annotation buffer.  If a
soft-ACK is an ACK, then we overwrite unack'd, nak'd or to-be-retransmitted
states and that is fine; but if the soft-ACK is an NACK, we overwrite the
to-be-retransmitted with a nak - which isn't.

Instead, we need to let any scheduled retransmission stand if the packet
was NAK'd.

Note that we don't reissue a resend if the annotation is in the
to-be-retransmitted state because someone else must've scheduled the
resend already.
