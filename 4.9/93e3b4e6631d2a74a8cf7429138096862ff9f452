ext4: reinforce check of i_dtime when clearing high fields of uid and gid

Now, ext4_do_update_inode() clears high 16-bit fields of uid/gid
of deleted and evicted inode to fix up interoperability with old
kernels. However, it checks only i_dtime of an inode to determine
whether the inode was deleted and evicted, and this is very risky,
because i_dtime can be used for the pointer maintaining orphan inode
list, too. We need to further check whether the i_dtime is being
used for the orphan inode list even if the i_dtime is not NULL.

We found that high 16-bit fields of uid/gid of inode are unintentionally
and permanently cleared when the inode truncation is just triggered,
but not finished, and the inode metadata, whose high uid/gid bits are
cleared, is written on disk, and the sudden power-off follows that
in order.
