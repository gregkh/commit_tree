MIPS: CPC: Avoid lock when MIPS CM >= 3 is present

MIPS CM version 3 removed the CPC_CL_OTHER register and instead the
CM_CL_OTHER register is used to redirect the CPC_OTHER region. As such,
we should not write the unimplmented register and can avoid the
spinlock as well.
These lock functions should aleady be called within the context of a
mips_cm_{lock,unlock}_other pair ensuring the correct CPC_OTHER region
will be accessed.
