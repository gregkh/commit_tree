dm raid: fix activation of existing raid4/10 devices

dm-raid 1.9.0 fails to activate existing RAID4/10 devices that have the
old superblock format (which does not have takeover/reshaping support
that was added via commit 33e53f06850f).

Fix validation path for old superblocks by reverting to the old raid4
layout and basing checks on mddev->new_{level,layout,...} members in
super_init_validation().
