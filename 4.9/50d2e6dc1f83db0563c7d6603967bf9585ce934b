crypto: gcm - Fix IV buffer size in crypto_gcm_setkey

The cipher block size for GCM is 16 bytes, and thus the CTR transform
used in crypto_gcm_setkey() will also expect a 16-byte IV. However,
the code currently reserves only 8 bytes for the IV, causing
an out-of-bounds access in the CTR transform. This patch fixes
the issue by setting the size of the IV buffer to 16 bytes.
