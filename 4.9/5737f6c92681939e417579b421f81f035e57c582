mlx4: add missed recycle opportunity for XDP_TX on TX failure

Correct drop handling for XDP_TX on TX failure, were recently added in
commit 95357907ae73 ("mlx4: fix XDP_TX is acting like XDP_PASS on TX
ring full").

The change missed an opportunity for recycling the RX page, instead of
going through the page allocator, like the regular XDP_DROP action does.
This patch cease the opportunity, by going through the XDP_DROP case.
