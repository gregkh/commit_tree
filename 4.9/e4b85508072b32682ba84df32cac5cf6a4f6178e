net/mlx5e: Slightly reduce hardware LRO size

Before this patch LRO size was 64K, now with build_skb requires
extra room, headroom + sizeof(skb_shared_info) added to the data
buffer will make  wqe size or page_frag_size slightly larger than
64K which will demand order 5 page instead of order 4 in 4K page systems.

We take those extra bytes from hardware LRO data size in order to not
increase the required page order for when hardware LRO is enabled.
