powerpc/eeh: Skip finding bus until after failure reporting

In eeh_handle_special_event(), eeh_pe_bus_get() is called before calling
eeh_report_failure() on every device under a PE.  If a PE was missing a
bus for some reason, the error would occur before reporting failure, even
though eeh_report_failure() doesn't require a bus.

Fix this by moving the bus retrieval and error check after the
eeh_report_failure() calls.
