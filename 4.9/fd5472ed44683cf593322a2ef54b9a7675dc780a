ceph: Propagate dentry down to inode_change_ok()

To avoid clearing of capabilities or security related extended
attributes too early, inode_change_ok() will need to take dentry instead
of inode. ceph_setattr() has the dentry easily available but
__ceph_setattr() is also called from ceph_set_acl() where dentry is not
easily available. Luckily that call path does not need inode_change_ok()
to be called anyway. So reorganize functions a bit so that
inode_change_ok() is called only from paths where dentry is available.
