greybus: Generate greybus wide unique ids for endo devices

Currently we name the endo device as "endo". And it shows up with the
same name in sysfs directory: /sys/bus/greybus/devices/.

But each device in kernel should be represented by a unique id in
kernel, and "endo" isn't unique.

Lets generate unique ids for endo devices. The ida mechanism for
allocating ids may be overkill but it works.
