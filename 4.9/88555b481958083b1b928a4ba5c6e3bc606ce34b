MIPS: PCI: Support for CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS_GENERIC

Introduce support for CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS_GENERIC, allowing for platforms
to make use of generic PCI domains instead of the MIPS-specific
implementation. The set_pci_need_domain_info function is introduced to
abstract away the removed need_domain_info field in struct
pci_controller, and pcibios_scanbus is adjusted to use the pci_domain_nr
accessor instead of directly accessing the index field.
