greybus: update operation result atomically

An operation result can be set both in and out of interrupt context.
For example, a response message could be arriving at the same time a
timeout of the operation is getting processed.  We therefore need to
ensure the result is accessed atomically.

Protect updates to the errno field using the operations spinlock.
