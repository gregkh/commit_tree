drm/i915: Derive GEM requests from dma-fence

dma-buf provides a generic fence class for interoperation between
drivers. Internally we use the request structure as a fence, and so with
only a little bit of interfacing we can rebase those requests on top of
dma-buf fences. This will allow us, in the future, to pass those fences
back to userspace or between drivers.

v2: The fence_context needs to be globally unique, not just unique to
this device.
