drm: Used DRM_LEGACY for all legacy functions

Except for nouveau, only legacy drivers need this really. And nouveau
is already marked up with DRIVER_KMS_LEGACY_CONTEXT as the special
case.

I've tried to be careful to leave everything related to modeset still
using the DRIVER_MODESET flag. Otherwise it's a direct replacement of
!DRIVER_MODESET with DRIVER_LEGACY checks. Also helps readability
since fewer negative checks overall.
