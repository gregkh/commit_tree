net: flow: Add l3mdev flow update

Add l3mdev hook to set FLOWI_FLAG_SKIP_NH_OIF flag and update oif/iif
in flow struct if its oif or iif points to a device enslaved to an L3
Master device. Only 1 needs to be converted to match the l3mdev FIB
rule. This moves the flow adjustment for l3mdev to a single point
catching all lookups. It is redundant for existing hooks (those are
removed in later patches) but is needed for missed lookups such as
PMTU updates.
