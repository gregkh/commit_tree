fs: Do to trim high file position bits in iomap_page_mkwrite_actor

iomap_page_mkwrite_actor() calls __block_write_begin_int() with position
masked as pos & ~PAGE_MASK which is equivalent to pos & (PAGE_SIZE-1).
Thus it masks off high bits of file position. However
__block_write_begin_int() expects full file position on input. This does
not cause any visible issues because all __block_write_begin_int()
really cares about are low file position bits but still it is a bug
waiting to happen.
