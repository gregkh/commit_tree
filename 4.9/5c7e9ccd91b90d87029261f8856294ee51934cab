zram: restrict add/remove attributes to root only

zram hot_add sysfs attribute is a very 'special' attribute - reading
from it creates a new uninitialized zram device.  This file, by a
mistake, can be read by a 'normal' user at the moment, while only root
must be able to create a new zram device, therefore hot_add attribute
must have S_IRUSR mode, not S_IRUGO.
