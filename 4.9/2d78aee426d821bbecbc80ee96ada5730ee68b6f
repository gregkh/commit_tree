UBI: simplify LEB write and atomic LEB change code

ubi_eba_write_leb(), ubi_eba_write_leb_st() and
ubi_eba_atomic_leb_change() are using a convoluted retry/exit path.
Add the try_write_vid_and_data() function to simplify the retry logic
and make sure we have a single exit path instead of manually releasing
the resources in each error path.
