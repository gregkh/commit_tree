drm/amd/powerplay: don't give up if DPM is already running

Currently the driver crashes if smu7_enable_dpm_tasks() returns early,
which it does if DPM is already active. It seems to be better just to
continue anyway, at least I haven't noticed any ill effects. It's also
unclear at what state the hardware was left by the previous driver, so
IMO it's better to always fully initialize.

Way to reproduce:
with GPU passthrough.
forced power off the VM or forced reset the VM
without shutting down the Os.
