mm, compaction: ignore fragindex from compaction_zonelist_suitable()

The compaction_zonelist_suitable() function tries to determine if
compaction will be able to proceed after sufficient reclaim, i.e.
whether there are enough reclaimable pages to provide enough order-0
freepages for compaction.

This addition of reclaimable pages to the free pages works well for the
order-0 watermark check, but in the fragmentation index check we only
consider truly free pages.  Thus we can get fragindex value close to 0
which indicates failure do to lack of memory, and wrongly decide that
compaction won't be suitable even after reclaim.

Instead of trying to somehow adjust fragindex for reclaimable pages,
let's just skip it from compaction_zonelist_suitable().
