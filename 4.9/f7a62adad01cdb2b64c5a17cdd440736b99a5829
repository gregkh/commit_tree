NFSv4.1: Allow revoked stateids to skip the call to TEST_STATEID

In some cases (e.g. when the SEQ4_STATUS_EXPIRED_ALL_STATE_REVOKED sequence
flag is set) we may already know that the stateid was revoked and that the
only valid operation we can call is FREE_STATEID. In those cases, allow
the stateid to carry the information in the type field, so that we skip
the redundant call to TEST_STATEID.
