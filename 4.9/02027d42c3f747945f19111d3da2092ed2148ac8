fs: Replace CURRENT_TIME_SEC with current_time() for inode timestamps

CURRENT_TIME_SEC is not y2038 safe. current_time() will
be transitioned to use 64 bit time along with vfs in a
separate patch.
There is no plan to transistion CURRENT_TIME_SEC to use
y2038 safe time interfaces.

current_time() will also be extended to use superblock
range checking parameters when range checking is introduced.

This works because alloc_super() fills in the the s_time_gran
in super block to NSEC_PER_SEC.
