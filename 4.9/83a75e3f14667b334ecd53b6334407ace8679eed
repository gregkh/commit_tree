Staging: lustre: Convert array index from the loop bound to the loop index.

Convert array index from the loop bound to the loop index.

The structure cl_env_percpu[NR_CPUS] has been initializing for each possible
cpu (i.e 0 to i). During initialization if any error will occurred, the error
handling code should uninitialize cl_env_percpu upto i. But currently
unitialization is repeatedly done for the same cl_env_percpu[i] element.
This does not seems to be correct.

Used below semantic patch to identify this issue:

@@
expression e1,e2,ar;
@@
for(e1 = 0; e1 < e2; e1++) { <...
  ar[
- e2
+ e1
  ]
  ...> }
