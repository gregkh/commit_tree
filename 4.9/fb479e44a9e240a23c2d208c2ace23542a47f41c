powerpc/64s: relocation, register save fixes for system reset interrupt

This patch does a couple of things. First of all, powernv immediately
explodes when running a relocated kernel, because the system reset
exception for handling sleeps does not do correct relocated branches.

Secondly, the sleep handling code trashes the condition and cfar
registers, which we would like to preserve for debugging purposes (for
non-sleep case exception).

This patch changes the exception to use the standard format that saves
registers before any tests or branches are made. It adds the test for
idle-wakeup as an "extra" to break out of the normal exception path.
Then it branches to a relocated idle handler that calls the various
idle handling functions.

After this patch, POWER8 CPU simulator now boots powernv kernel that is
running at non-zero.
