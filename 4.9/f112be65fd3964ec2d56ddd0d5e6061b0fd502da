xen-netback: fix type mismatch warning

Wiht the latest rework of the xen-netback driver, we get a warning
on ARM about the types passed into min():

drivers/net/xen-netback/rx.c: In function 'xenvif_rx_next_chunk':
include/linux/kernel.h:739:16: error: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast [-Werror]

The reason is that XEN_PAGE_SIZE is not size_t here. There
is no actual bug, and we can easily avoid the warning using the
min_t() macro instead of min().
