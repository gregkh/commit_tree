greybus: interface: fix interface_id attribute group

All interfaces, regardless of type, should have an interface_id
attribute reflecting its position on the frame.

This has been reported to cause an assertion failure in libmoduleutil
for dummy modules.

Testing done: Verified that the attribute is present for registered
dummy interfaces.
