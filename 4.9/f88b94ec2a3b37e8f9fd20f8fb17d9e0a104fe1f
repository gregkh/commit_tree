greybus: camera: Configure APB-A with new params

Update the configuration supplied to APB-A to use new parameters, while
keeping compatibility with legacy camera modules.
Substitute hard-coded clock frequency with information provided by camera
module, and retrieve the maximum CSI Long Packet length from the
returned stream configuration.

This patch requires APB-A csi-tx driver to be updated to comply with
newly defined bandwidth requirements.

Testing Done: preview, capture and video recording with updated csi-tx
driver on APB-A side, and legacy white camera module firmware
