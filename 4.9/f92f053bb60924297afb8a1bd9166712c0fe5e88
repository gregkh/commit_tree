drm: Move property validation to a helper, v2.

Property lifetimes are equal to the device lifetime, so the separate
drm_property_find is not needed. The pointer can be retrieved from
the properties member, which saves us some locking and a extra lookup.
The lifetime for properties is until the device is destroyed, which
happens late in the device unload path.

kms_atomic is also testing for invalid properties which returns -ENOENT,
to be consistent return -ENOENT for valid properties that don't appear
on the object property list.

Changes since v1:
- Return -ENOENT for invalid properties to make kms_atomic pass.
- Change commit message slightly to take this into account.

Testcase: kms_atomic
Testcase: kms_properties
