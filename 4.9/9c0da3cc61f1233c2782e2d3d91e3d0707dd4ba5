ARM: dts: explicitly mark skeleton.dtsi as deprecated

As noted in commit 3ebee5a2e141496b ("arm64: dts: kill skeleton.dtsi"),
there are a number of problems with skeleton.dtsi, and it would be
prefereable to remove it entirely. As there are a large number of
existing users, fixing these up will take a while.

This patch adds a note to arm's skeleton.dtsi noting that this is the
case, to make this more obvious and hopefully minimize new uptake of
skeleton.dtsi in the mean time.
