greybus: add write retry support for i2c

It is expected that i2c writes may fail, and in that case the driver
simply retries some number of times before actually treating it as a
failure.  Define a GB_OP_RETRY status, which is interpreted by the
i2c driver as an indication a retry is in order.  We just translate
that into an EAGAIN error passed back to the i2c core.
