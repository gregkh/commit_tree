percpu: use notrace variant of preempt_disable/preempt_enable

Commit 345ddcc882d8 ("ftrace: Have set_ftrace_pid use the bitmap like
events do") added a couple of this_cpu_read calls to the ftrace code.

On x86 this is not a problem, since it has single instructions to read
percpu data. Other architectures which use the generic variant now
have additional preempt_disable and preempt_enable calls in the core
ftrace code. This may lead to recursive calls and in result to a dead
machine, e.g. if preemption and debugging options are enabled.

To fix this use the notrace variant of preempt_disable and
preempt_enable within the generic percpu code.
