Drivers: hv: vmbus: fix the race when querying & updating the percpu list

There is a rare race when we remove an entry from the global list
hv_context.percpu_list[cpu] in hv_process_channel_removal() ->
percpu_channel_deq() -> list_del(): at this time, if vmbus_on_event() ->
process_chn_event() -> pcpu_relid2channel() is trying to query the list,
we can get the kernel fault.

Similarly, we also have the issue in the code path: vmbus_process_offer() ->
percpu_channel_enq().

We can resolve the issue by disabling the tasklet when updating the list.

The patch also moves vmbus_release_relid() to a later place where
the channel has been removed from the per-cpu and the global lists.
