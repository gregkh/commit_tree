xen-netback: retire guest rx side prefix GSO feature

As far as I am aware only very old Windows network frontends make use of
this style of passing GSO packets from backend to frontend. These
frontends can easily be replaced by the freely available Xen Project
Windows PV network frontend, which uses the 'default' mechanism for
passing GSO packets, which is also used by all Linux frontends.

NOTE: Removal of this feature will not cause breakage in old Windows
      frontends. They simply will no longer receive GSO packets - the
      packets instead being fragmented in the backend.
