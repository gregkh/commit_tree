gpiolib: Make it possible to exclude GPIOs from IRQ domain

When using GPIO irqchip helpers to setup irqchip for a gpiolib based
driver, it is not possible to select which GPIOs to add to the IRQ domain.
Instead it just adds all GPIOs which is not always desired. For example
there might be GPIOs that for some reason cannot generated normal
interrupts at all.

To support this we add a flag irq_need_valid_mask to struct gpio_chip. When
this flag is set the core allocates irq_valid_mask that holds one bit for
each GPIO the chip has. By default all bits are set but drivers can
manipulate this using set_bit() and clear_bit() accordingly.

Then when gpiochip_irqchip_add() is called, this mask is checked and all
GPIOs with bit is set are added to the IRQ domain created for the GPIO
chip.
