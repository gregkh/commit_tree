perf tools: Experiment with cppcheck

Experimenting a bit using cppcheck[1], a static checker brought to my
attention by Colin, reducing the scope of some variables, reducing the
line of source code lines in the process:

  $ cppcheck --enable=style tools/perf/util/thread.c
  Checking tools/perf/util/thread.c...
  [tools/perf/util/thread.c:17]: (style) The scope of the variable 'leader' can be reduced.
  [tools/perf/util/thread.c:133]: (style) The scope of the variable 'err' can be reduced.
  [tools/perf/util/thread.c:273]: (style) The scope of the variable 'err' can be reduced.

Will continue later, but these are already useful, keep them.
