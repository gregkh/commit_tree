HID: wacom: Augment 'oVid' and 'oPid' with heuristics for HID_GENERIC

The 'oVid' and 'oPid' variables used by wacom_are_sibling are a hacky
solution to the problem of the driver historically having few good
heuristics to use in determining if two devices should be considered
siblings or not. While it works well enough for explicitly supported
devices, it offers no help for HID_GENERIC devices. Now that we have
a bit more information (e.g. direct/indirect) available to us though,
we should make use of it it to improve the pairing of such devices.
