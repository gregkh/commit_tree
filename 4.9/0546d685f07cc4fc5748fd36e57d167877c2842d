drm/rockchip: analogix_dp: Refuse to enable PSR if panel doesn't support it

There's no point in enabling PSR when the panel doesn't support it.

This also avoids a problem when PSR gets enabled when a CRTC is being
disabled, because sometimes in that situation the DSP_HOLD_VALID_INTR
interrupt on which we wait will never arrive. This was observed on
RK3288 with a panel without PSR (veyron-jaq Chromebook).

It's very easy to reproduce by running the kms_rmfb test in IGT a few
times.
