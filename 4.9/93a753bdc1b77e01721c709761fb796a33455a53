ARM: mvebu/orion: remove NO_IRQ check from device init

For most devices, we know in advance whether they have an
interrupt line or not, so we can avoid passing NO_IRQ and
instead split fill_resources() into two interfaces, with
only the new fill_resources_irq() function taking an irq
argument, which it then can use unconditionally.
