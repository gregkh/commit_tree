gpio: mpc8xxx: Correct irq handler function

From the beginning of the gpio-mpc8xxx.c, the "handle_level_irq"
has being used to handle GPIO interrupts in the PowerPC/Layerscape
platforms. But actually, almost all PowerPC/Layerscape platforms
assert an interrupt request upon either a high-to-low change or
any change on the state of the signal.

So the "handle_level_irq" is not reasonable for PowerPC/Layerscape
GPIO interrupt, it should be "handle_edge_irq". Otherwise the system
may lost some interrupts from the PIN's state changes.
