radix-tree tests: add iteration test

There are four cases I can see where we could end up with a NULL 'slot' in
radix_tree_next_slot().  This unit test exercises all four of them, making
sure that if in the future we have an unsafe path through
radix_tree_next_slot(), we'll catch it.

Here are details on the four cases:

1) radix_tree_iter_retry() via a non-tagged iteration like
radix_tree_for_each_slot().  In this case we currently aren't seeing a bug
because radix_tree_iter_retry() sets

    iter->next_index = iter->index;

which means that in in the else case in radix_tree_next_slot(), 'count' is
zero, so we skip over the while() loop and effectively just return NULL
without ever dereferencing 'slot'.

2) radix_tree_iter_retry() via tagged iteration like
radix_tree_for_each_tagged().  This case was giving us NULL pointer
dereferences in testing, and was fixed with this commit:

commit 3cb9185c6730 ("radix-tree: fix radix_tree_iter_retry() for tagged
iterators.")

This fix doesn't explicitly check for 'slot' being NULL, though, it works
around the NULL pointer dereference by instead zeroing iter->tags in
radix_tree_iter_retry(), which makes us bail out of the if() case in
radix_tree_next_slot() before we dereference 'slot'.

3) radix_tree_iter_next() via via a non-tagged iteration like
radix_tree_for_each_slot().  This currently happens in shmem_tag_pins()
and shmem_partial_swap_usage().

As with non-tagged iteration, 'count' in the else case of
radix_tree_next_slot() is zero, so we skip over the while() loop and
effectively just return NULL without ever dereferencing 'slot'.

4) radix_tree_iter_next() via tagged iteration like
radix_tree_for_each_tagged().  This happens in shmem_wait_for_pins().

radix_tree_iter_next() zeros out iter->tags, so we end up exiting
radix_tree_next_slot() here:

    if (flags & RADIX_TREE_ITER_TAGGED) {
	    void *canon = slot;

	    iter->tags >>= 1;
	    if (unlikely(!iter->tags))
		    return NULL;
