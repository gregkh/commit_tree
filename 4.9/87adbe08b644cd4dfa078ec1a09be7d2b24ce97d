scsi: ipr: Remove redundant messages at adapter init time

Whenever multiple HRRQs are enabled, which is the default setting now,
we end up seeing the following message logged prior to initialization of
each HRRQ:

Starting IOA initialization sequence

This results in 16 of these messages on most adapters, which serves
little purpose. Change to just log this once.
