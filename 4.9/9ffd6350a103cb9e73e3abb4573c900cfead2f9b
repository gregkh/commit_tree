nfit: don't start a full scrub by default for an MCE

Starting a full Address Range Scrub (ARS) on hitting a memory error
machine check exception may not always be desirable. Provide a way
through sysfs to toggle the behavior between just adding the address
(cache line) where the MCE happened to the poison list and doing a full
scrub. The former (selective insertion of the address) is done
unconditionally.
