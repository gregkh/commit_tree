xen: Make VPMU init message look less scary

The default for the Xen hypervisor is to not enable VPMU in order to
avoid security issues. In this case the Linux kernel will issue the
message "Could not initialize VPMU for cpu 0, error -95" which looks
more like an error than a normal state.

Change the message to something less scary in case the hypervisor
returns EOPNOTSUPP or ENOSYS when trying to activate VPMU.
