samples/bpf: Add tunnel set/get tests.

The patch creates sample code exercising bpf_skb_{set,get}_tunnel_key,
and bpf_skb_{set,get}_tunnel_opt for GRE, VXLAN, and GENEVE.  A native
tunnel device is created in a namespace to interact with a lwtunnel
device out of the namespace, with metadata enabled.  The bpf_skb_set_*
program is attached to tc egress and bpf_skb_get_* is attached to egress
qdisc.  A ping between two tunnels is used to verify correctness and
the result of bpf_skb_get_* printed by bpf_trace_printk.
