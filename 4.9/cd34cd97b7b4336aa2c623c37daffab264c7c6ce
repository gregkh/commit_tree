perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Skylake server uncore support

This patch implements the uncore monitoring driver for Skylake server.
The uncore subsystem in Skylake server is similar to previous
server. There are some differences in config register encoding and pci
device IDs. Besides, Skylake introduces many new boxes to reflect the
MESH architecture changes.

The control registers for IIO and UPI have been extended to 64 bit. This
patch also introduces event_mask_ext to handle the high 32 bit mask.

The CHA box number could vary for different machines. This patch gets
the CHA box number by counting the CHA register space during
initialization at runtime.
