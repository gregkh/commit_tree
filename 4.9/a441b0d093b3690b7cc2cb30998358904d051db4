block: remove remnant refs to hardsect

commit e1defc4ff0cf57aca6c5e3ff99fa503f5943c1f1
"block: Do away with the notion of hardsect_size"
removed the notion of "hardware sector size" from
the kernel in favor of logical block size, but
references remain in comments and documentation.

Update the remaining sites mentioning hardsect.
