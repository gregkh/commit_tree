kbuild: allow archs to select link dead code/data elimination

Introduce LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION option for architectures to
select to build with -ffunction-sections, -fdata-sections, and link
with --gc-sections. It requires some work (documented) to ensure all
unreferenced entrypoints are live, and requires toolchain and build
verification, so it is made a per-arch option for now.

On a random powerpc64le build, this yelds a significant size saving,
it boots and runs fine, but there is a lot I haven't tested as yet, so
these savings may be reduced if there are bugs in the link.
