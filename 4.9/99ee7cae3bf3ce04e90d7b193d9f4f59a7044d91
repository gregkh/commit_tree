mac80211: add support for radiotap timestamp field

Use the existing device timestamp from the RX status information
to add support for the new radiotap timestamp field. Currently
only 32-bit counters are supported, but we also add the radiotap
mactime where applicable. This new field allows more flexibility
in where the timestamp is taken etc. The non-timestamp data in
the field is taken from a new field in the hw struct.
