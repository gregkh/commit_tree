perf/core: Generalize event->group_flags

Currently, PERF_GROUP_SOFTWARE is used in the group_flags field of a
group's leader to indicate that is_software_event(event) is true for all
events in a group. This is the only usage of event->group_flags.

This pattern of setting a group level flags when all events in the group
share a property is useful for the flag introduced in the next patch and
for future CQM/CMT flags. So this patches generalizes group_flags to work
as an aggregate of event level flags.

PERF_GROUP_SOFTWARE denotes an inmutable event's property. All other flags
that I intend to add are also determinable at event initialization.
To better convey the above, this patch renames event's group_flags to
group_caps and PERF_GROUP_SOFTWARE to PERF_EV_CAP_SOFTWARE.

Individual event flags are stored in the new event->event_caps. Since the
cap flags do not change after event initialization, there is no need to
serialize event_caps. This new field is used when events are added to a
context, similarly to how PERF_GROUP_SOFTWARE and is_software_event()
worked.

Lastly, for consistency, updates is_software_event() to rely in event_cap
instead of the context index.
