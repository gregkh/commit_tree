drm/i915: Remove i915_gem_execbuffer_retire_commands()

Move the single line to the callsite as the name is now misleading, and
the purpose is solely to add the request to the execution queue. Here,
we can see that if we failed to dispatch the batch from the request, we
can forgo flushing the GPU when closing the request.
