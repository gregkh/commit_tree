i2c: mux: add support for 'i2c-mux', 'i2c-arb' and 'i2c-gate' DT subnodes

Backwards compatibility is preserved; the subnodes are in practice
optional.

However, the mux core needs to know what subnode it should examine, so add
a couple of new flags for i2c_mux_alloc for this purpose.

The rule is that if the mux core finds a 'reg' property in the appropriate
subnode, e.g. if 'reg' exists in the 'i2c-mux' subnode, then the mux core
will assume that this is an old style entry and not an i2c-mux subnode
(correspondingly for arbitrators and gates with 'i2c-arb' and 'i2c-gate').
