net/hyperv: avoid uninitialized variable

The hdr_offset variable is only if we deal with a TCP or UDP packet,
but as the check surrounding its usage tests for skb_is_gso()
instead, the compiler has no idea if the variable is initialized
or not at that point:

drivers/net/hyperv/netvsc_drv.c: In function ‘netvsc_start_xmit’:
drivers/net/hyperv/netvsc_drv.c:494:42: error: ‘hdr_offset’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This adds an additional check for the transport type, which
tells the compiler that this path cannot happen. Since the
get_net_transport_info() function should always be inlined
here, I don't expect this to result in additional runtime
checks.
