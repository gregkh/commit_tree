MIPS: TXx9: Convert to Common Clock Framework

Replace the custom minimal clock implementation for Toshiba TXx9 by a
basic implementation using the Common Clock Framework.

The only clocks that are provided are those needed by TXx9-specific
drivers ("imbus" and "spi" (TX4938 only)), and their common parent
clock "gbus". Other clocks can be added when needed.
