mm: fix false-positive WARN_ON() in truncate/invalidate for hugetlb

Hugetlb pages have ->index in size of the huge pages (PMD_SIZE or
PUD_SIZE), not in PAGE_SIZE as other types of pages.  This means we
cannot user page_to_pgoff() to check whether we've got the right page
for the radix-tree index.

Let's introduce page_to_index() which would return radix-tree index for
given page.

We will be able to get rid of this once hugetlb will be switched to
multi-order entries.
