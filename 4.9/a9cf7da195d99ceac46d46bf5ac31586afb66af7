greybus: es1: fix transfer-buffer alignment

Fix transfer-buffer alignment of outgoing transfers which are currently
byte aligned.

Some USB host drivers cannot handle byte-aligned buffers and will
allocate temporary buffers, which the data is copied to or from on every
transfer. This affects for example musb (e.g. Beaglebone Black) and
ehci-tegra (e.g. Jetson).

Instead of transferring pad bytes on the wire, let's (ab)use the pad
bytes of the operation message header to transfer the cport id. This
gives us properly aligned buffers and more efficient transfers in both
directions.

By using both pad bytes, we can also remove the arbitrary limitation of
256 cports.

Note that the protocol between the host driver and the UniPro bridge is
not necessarily Greybus. As long as the firmware clears the pad bytes
before forwarding the data, and the host driver does the same before
passing received data up the stack, this should be considered "legal"
use.
