PM / sleep: Increase default DPM watchdog timeout to 120

Recently we have a new report that, the harddisk can not
resume on time due to firmware issues, and got a kernel
panic because of DPM watchdog timeout. So adjust the
default timeout from 60 to 120 to survive on this platform,
and make DPM_WATCHDOG depending on EXPERT.
