powerpc/powernv: Pass CPU-endian PE number to opal_pci_eeh_freeze_clear()

The PE number (@frozen_pe_no), filled by opal_pci_next_error() is in
big-endian format. It should be converted to CPU-endian before it is
passed to opal_pci_eeh_freeze_clear() when clearing the frozen state if
the PE is invalid one. As Michael Ellerman pointed out, the issue is
also detected by sparse:

  eeh-powernv.c:1541:41: warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different base types)

This passes CPU-endian PE number to opal_pci_eeh_freeze_clear() and it
should be part of commit <0f36db77643b> ("powerpc/eeh: Fix wrong printed
PE number"), which was merged to 4.3 kernel.

Fixes: 71b540adffd9 ("powerpc/powernv: Don't escalate non-existing frozen PE")
