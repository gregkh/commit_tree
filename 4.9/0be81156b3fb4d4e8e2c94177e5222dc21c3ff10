drm/i915: Reattach comment, complete type specification

In the recent patch
bc3d674 drm/i915: Allow userspace to request no-error-capture upon ...
the final version moved the flags and the associated #defines around
so they were adjacent; unfortunately, they ended up between a comment
and the thing (hw_id) to which the comment applies :(

So this patch reshuffles the comment and subject back together.

Also, as we're touching 'hw_id', let's change it from just 'unsigned'
to a fully-specified 'unsigned int', because some code checking tools
(including checkpatch) object to plain 'unsigned'.
