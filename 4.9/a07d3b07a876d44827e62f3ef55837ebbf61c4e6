arm64: KVM: vgic-v2: Enable GICV access from HYP if access from guest is unsafe

So far, we've been disabling KVM on systems where the GICV region couldn't
be safely given to a guest. Now that we're able to handle this access
safely by emulating it in HYP, we can enable this feature when we detect
an unsafe configuration.
