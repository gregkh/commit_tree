drm/i915/lrc: Update function names to match request flow

With adding engine->submit_request, we now have a bunch of functions
with similar names used at different stages of the execlist submission.
Try a different coat of paint, to hopefully reduce confusion between the
requests, intel_engine_cs and the actual execlists submision process.
