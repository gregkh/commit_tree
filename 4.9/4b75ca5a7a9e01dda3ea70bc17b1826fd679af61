net: bcm63xx: avoid referencing uninitialized variable

gcc found a reference to an uninitialized variable in the error handling
of bcm_enet_open, introduced by a recent cleanup:

drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bcm63xx_enet.c: In function 'bcm_enet_open'
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bcm63xx_enet.c:1129:2: warning: 'phydev' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

This makes the use of that variable conditional, so we only reference it
here after it has been used before. Unlike my normal patches, I have not
build-tested this one, as I don't currently have mips test in my
randconfig setup.
