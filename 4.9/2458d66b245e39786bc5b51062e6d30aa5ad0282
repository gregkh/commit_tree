ACPI / APEI: Send correct severity to calculate AER severity

Currently the AER severity is calculated by calling cper_severity_to_aer(),
but the parameter sent is actually the GHES severity.  This causes the AER
severity to be incorrect.

Fix the parameter to be the CPER severity instead of the GHES severity.
