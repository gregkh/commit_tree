xc2028: Fix use-after-free bug properly

The commit 8dfbcc4351a0 ("[media] xc2028: avoid use after free") tried
to address the reported use-after-free by clearing the reference.

However, it's clearing the wrong pointer; it sets NULL to
priv->ctrl.fname, but it's anyway overwritten by the next line
memcpy(&priv->ctrl, p, sizeof(priv->ctrl)).

OTOH, the actual code accessing the freed string is the strcmp() call
with priv->fname:
	if (!firmware_name[0] && p->fname &&
	    priv->fname && strcmp(p->fname, priv->fname))
		free_firmware(priv);

where priv->fname points to the previous file name, and this was
already freed by kfree().

For fixing the bug properly, this patch does the following:

- Keep the copy of firmware file name in only priv->fname,
  priv->ctrl.fname isn't changed;
- The allocation is done only when the firmware gets loaded;
- The kfree() is called in free_firmware() commonly
