arm64: simplify contextidr_thread_switch

When CONFIG_PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR is not selected, we use an empty stub
definition of contextidr_thread_switch(). As everything we rely upon
exists regardless of CONFIG_PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR, we don't strictly require
an empty stub.

By using IS_ENABLED() rather than ifdeffery, we avoid duplication, and
get compiler coverage on all the code even when CONFIG_PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR
is not selected and the code is optimised away.
