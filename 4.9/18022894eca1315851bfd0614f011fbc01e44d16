MIPS: traps: 64bit kernels should read CP0_EBase 64bit

When reading the CP0_EBase register containing the WG (write gate) bit,
the ebase variable should be set to the full value of the register, i.e.
on a 64-bit kernel the full 64-bit width of the register via
read_cp0_ebase_64(), and on a 32-bit kernel the full 32-bit width
including bits 31:30 which may be writeable.
