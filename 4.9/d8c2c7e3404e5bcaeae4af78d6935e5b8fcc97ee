qed*: Add support for VFs over legacy PFs

Modern VFs can't run on old non-compatible as the fastpath HSI is
slightly changed - but as the HSI is actually very close [basically,
a single bit whose meaning flipped] this can be supported with small
modifications.

The major differences would be in:
  - Recognizing that VF is running on top of a legacy PF.
  - Returning some slowpath configurations that are no longer needed
    on top of modern PFs, but would be required when working over
    the legacy ones.
