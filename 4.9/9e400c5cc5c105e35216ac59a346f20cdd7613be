clk: bcm2835: Mark the CM SDRAM clock's parent as critical

While the SDRAM is being driven by its dedicated PLL most of the time,
there is a little loop running in the firmware that periodically turns
on the CM SDRAM clock (using its pre-initialized parent) and switches
SDRAM to using the CM clock to do PVT recalibration.

This avoids system hangs if we choose SDRAM's parent for some other
clock, then disable that clock.
