dt-bindings: i2c: add support for 'i2c-mux' subnode

Similar to the new optional 'i2c-bus' subnode from Jon Hunter, this
adds an optional 'i2c-mux' subnode, for similar reasons. I.e. it is
bad of the i2c mux core to assume that any subnode of an i2c mux device
is a potential (when the 'reg' property matches) i2c-mux child bus,
given that i2c mux devices might do more than mux i2c traffic.

So, if an 'i2c-mux' subnode is present, dictate that all i2c-mux child
buses exist beneath that subnode.
