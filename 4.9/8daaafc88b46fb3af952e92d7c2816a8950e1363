KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Introduce kvmppc_passthru_irqmap

This patch introduces an IRQ mapping structure, the
kvmppc_passthru_irqmap structure that is to be used
to map the real hardware IRQ in the host with the virtual
hardware IRQ (gsi) that is injected into a guest by KVM for
passthrough adapters.

Currently, we assume a separate IRQ mapping structure for
each guest. Each kvmppc_passthru_irqmap has a mapping arrays,
containing all defined real<->virtual IRQs.

[paulus@ozlabs.org - removed irq_chip field from struct
 kvmppc_passthru_irqmap; changed parameter for
 kvmppc_get_passthru_irqmap from struct kvm_vcpu * to struct
 kvm *, removed small cached array.]
