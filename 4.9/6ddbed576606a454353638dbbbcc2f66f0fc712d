greybus: interface: fix broken UniPro flow control

A recent commit inadvertently disabled E2EFC on all interface
connections, due to a failure to clear the ES3 bootrom quirk flags
during mode switch.

Testing Done: Verified that the CPort flags are again set to 0x7 for
non-bootrom interface connections.

mode switch")
