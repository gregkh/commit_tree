drm: virtio: reinstate drm_virtio_set_busid()

Before commit a325725633c2 ("drm: Lobotomize set_busid nonsense for !pci
drivers"), several DRM drivers for platform devices used to expose an
explicit "drm_driver.set_busid" callback, invariably backed by
drm_platform_set_busid().

Commit a325725633c2 removed drm_platform_set_busid(), along with the
referring .set_busid field initializations. This was justified because
interchangeable functionality had been implemented in drm_dev_alloc() /
drm_dev_init(), which DRM_IOCTL_SET_VERSION would rely on going forward.

However, commit a325725633c2 also removed drm_virtio_set_busid(), for
which the same consolidation was not appropriate: this .set_busid callback
had been implemented with drm_pci_set_busid(), and not
drm_platform_set_busid(). The error regressed Xorg/xserver on QEMU's
"virtio-vga" card; the drmGetBusid() function from libdrm would no longer
return stable PCI identifiers like "pci:0000:00:02.0", but rather unstable
platform ones like "virtio0".

Reinstate drm_virtio_set_busid() with judicious use of
