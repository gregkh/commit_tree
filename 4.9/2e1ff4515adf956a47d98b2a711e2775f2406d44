staging: lustre: obdclass: optimize busy loop wait

two optimizations in the busy loop wait in class_cleanup():
(1) remove unnecessary spinlocks protecting obd_conn_inprogress
    access
(2) replace cond_resched by more suitable yield to unconditionally
    yield the CPU if the condition check fails.
