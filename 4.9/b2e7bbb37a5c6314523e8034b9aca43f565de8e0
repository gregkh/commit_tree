staging: lustre: llite: handle concurrent use of cob_transient_pages

With the lockless __generic_file_aio_write introduced in LU-1669,
ll_direct_IO_26 is no longer protected by the inode i_isem.

This renders obsoltete checks that all transient pages have been
handled before and after entry, and requires atomic access to their
counter.
