RDMA/uverbs: Initialize cq_context appropriately

Initializing cq_context with ev_queue in create_cq(), leads to NULL pointer
dereference in ib_uverbs_comp_handler(), if application doesnot use completion
channel. This patch fixes the cq_context initialization.

Fixes: 1e7710f3f65 ("IB/core: Change completion channel to use the reworked")
