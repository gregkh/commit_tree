e1000: avoid null pointer dereference on invalid stat type

Currently if the stat type is invalid then data[i] is being set
either by dereferencing a null pointer p, or it is reading from
an incorrect previous location if we had a valid stat type
previously.  Fix this by skipping over the read of p on an invalid
stat type.
