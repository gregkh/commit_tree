ARM: OMAP2+: Register SoC device attributes from machine .init()

SoC device attributes are registered with a call to
soc_device_register() from the machine .init_late() operation, which is
called from the late initcall, after all drivers built-in drivers have
been probed. This results in the impossibility for drivers to use SoC
device matching in their probe function.

The omap_soc_device_init() function is safe to call from the machine
.init() operation, as all data it depends on is initialized from the
.init_early() operation. Move SoC device attribute registration to
machine .init() like on all other ARM platforms.
