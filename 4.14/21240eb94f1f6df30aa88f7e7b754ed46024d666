reset: make (de)assert report success for self-deasserting reset drivers

By now there are drivers using shared reset controls and (de)assert
calls on platforms with self-deasserting reset lines and thus reset
drivers that do not implement .assert() and .deassert().
As long as the initial state of the reset line is deasserted, there
is no reason for a reset_control_assert call to return an error for
shared reset controls, or for a reset_control_deassert call to return
an error for either shared or exclusive reset controls: after a call
to reset_control_deassert the reset line is guaranteed to be deasserted,
and after a call to reset_control_assert it is valid for the reset
line to stay deasserted for shared reset controls.
