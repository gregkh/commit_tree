ARM: dts: BCM5301X: Specify USB ports for USB LEDs of few devices

This uses trigger-sources documented in commit 80dc6e1cd85fc ("dt-bindings:
leds: document new trigger-sources property") to specify USB ports. Such an
information can be used by operating system to setup LEDs behavior.

I updated dts files for 7 devices I own and I was able to test.
