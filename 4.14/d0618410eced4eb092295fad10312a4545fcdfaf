tracing, perf: Adjust code layout in get_recursion_context()

In an XDP redirect applications using tracepoint xdp:xdp_redirect to
diagnose TX overrun, I noticed perf_swevent_get_recursion_context()
was consuming 2% CPU. This was reduced to 1.85% with this simple
change.

Looking at the annotated asm code, it was clear that the unlikely case
in_nmi() test was chosen (by the compiler) as the most likely
event/branch.  This small adjustment makes the compiler (GCC version
7.1.1 20170622 (Red Hat 7.1.1-3)) put in_nmi() as an unlikely branch.
