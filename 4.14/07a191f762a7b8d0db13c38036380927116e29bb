scsi: cxlflash: Fix vlun resize failure in the shrink path

The ioctl DK_CAPI_VLUN_RESIZE can fail if the allocated vlun size is
reduced from almost maximum capacity and then increased again.

The shrink_lxt() routine is currently using the SISL_ASTATUS_MASK to
mask the higher 48 bits of the lxt entry. This is unnecessary and
incorrect as it uses a mask designed for the asynchronous interrupt
status register.  When the 4 port support was added to cxlflash, the
SISL_ASTATUS_MASK was updated to reflect the status bits for all 4
ports. This change indirectly affected the shrink_lxt() code path.

To extract the base, simply shift the bits without masking.
