Documentation/locking/atomic: Add documents for new atomic_t APIs

Since we've vastly expanded the atomic_t interface in recent years the
existing documentation is woefully out of date and people seem to get
confused a bit.

Start a new document to hopefully better explain the current state of
affairs.

The old atomic_ops.txt also covers bitmaps and a few more details so
this is not a full replacement and we'll therefore keep that document
around until such a time that we've managed to write more text to cover
its entire.

Also please, ReST people, go away.
