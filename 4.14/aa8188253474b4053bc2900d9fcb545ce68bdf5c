kernfs: add exportfs operations

Now we have the facilities to implement exportfs operations. The idea is
cgroup can export the fhandle info to userspace, then userspace uses
fhandle to find the cgroup name. Another example is userspace can get
fhandle for a cgroup and BPF uses the fhandle to filter info for the
cgroup.
