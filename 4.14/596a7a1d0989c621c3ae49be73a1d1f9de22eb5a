genirq/msi: Fix populating multiple interrupts

On allocating the interrupts routed via a wire-to-MSI bridge, the allocator
iterates over the MSI descriptors to build the hierarchy, but fails to use
the descriptor interrupt number, and instead uses the base number,
generating the wrong IRQ domain mappings.

The fix is to use the MSI descriptor interrupt number when setting up
the interrupt instead of the base interrupt for the allocation range.

The only saving grace is that although the MSI descriptors are allocated
in bulk, the wired interrupts are only allocated one by one (so
desc->irq == virq) and the bug went unnoticed so far.
