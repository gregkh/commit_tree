arm64: Use larger stacks when KASAN is selected

AddressSanitizer instrumentation can significantly bloat the stack, and
with GCC 7 this can result in stack overflows at boot time in some
configurations.

We can avoid this by doubling our stack size when KASAN is in use, as is
already done on x86 (and has been since KASAN was introduced).
Regardless of other patches to decrease KASAN's stack utilization,
kernels built with KASAN will always require more stack space than those
built without, and we should take this into account.
