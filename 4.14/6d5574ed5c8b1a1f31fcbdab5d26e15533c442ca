ASoC: topology: Fix a potential NULL pointer dereference in 'soc_tplg_dapm_widget_denum_create()'

if 'se = kzalloc()' fails in the 'for' loop, we will branch to 'err'.
But in this case, 'kc[i].private_value' will still be NULL. A NULL pointer
dereference will then occur is the error handling path.

In such a case, it is safe to just 'continue' in order to skip this entry
and free the other ones.
