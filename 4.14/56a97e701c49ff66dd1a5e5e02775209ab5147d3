netfilter: expect: add to hash table after expect init

assuming we have lockless readers we should make sure they can only
see expectations that have already been initialized.

hlist_add_head_rcu acts as memory barrier, move it after timer setup.

Theoretically we could crash due to a del_timer() on other cpu
seeing garbage data.
