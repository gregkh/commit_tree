staging: r8822be: Add r8822be btcoexist routines to staging

The RTL8822BE, an 802.11ac wireless network card, is now appearing in
new computers. Its driver is being placed in staging to reduce the time
that users of this new card will have access to in-kernel drivers.

This commit adds the routines needed for BT coexistence with the
new driver.
