arm64: fpsimd: Consistently use __this_cpu_ ops where appropriate

__this_cpu_ ops are not used consistently with regard to this_cpu_
ops in a couple of places in fpsimd.c.

Since preemption is explicitly disabled in
fpsimd_restore_current_state() and fpsimd_update_current_state(),
this patch converts this_cpu_ ops in those functions to __this_cpu_
ops.  This doesn't save cost on arm64, but benefits from additional
assertions in the core code.
