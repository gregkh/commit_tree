arm64: Ensure fpsimd support is ready before userspace is active

We register the pm/hotplug callbacks for FPSIMD as late_initcall,
which happens after the userspace is active (from initramfs via
populate_rootfs, a rootfs_initcall). Make sure we are ready even
before the userspace could potentially use it, by promoting to
a core_initcall.
