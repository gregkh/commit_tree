powerpc/32: optimise memset()

There is no need to extend the set value to an int when the length
is lower than 4 as in that case we only do byte stores.
We can therefore immediately branch to the part handling it.
By separating it from the normal case, we are able to eliminate
a few actions on the destination pointer.
