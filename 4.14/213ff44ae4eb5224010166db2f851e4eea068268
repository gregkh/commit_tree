x86/hyper-V: Allocate the IDT entry early in boot

Allocate the hypervisor callback IDT entry early in the boot sequence.

The previous code would allocate the entry as part of registering the handler
when the vmbus driver loaded, and this caused a problem for the IDT cleanup
that Thomas is working on for v4.15.
