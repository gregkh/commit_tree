apparmor: fix race condition in null profile creation

There is a race when null- profile is being created between the
initial lookup/creation of the profile and lock/addition of the
profile. This could result in multiple version of a profile being
added to the list which need to be removed/replaced.

Since these are learning profile their is no affect on mediation.
