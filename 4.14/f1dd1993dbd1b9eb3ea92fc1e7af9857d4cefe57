net: systemport: Use correct I/O accessors

The SYSTEMPORT driver currently uses __raw_{read,write}l which means
native I/O endian. This works correctly for an ARM LE kernel (default)
but fails miserably on an ARM BE (BE8) kernel where registers are kept
little endian, so replace uses with {read,write}l_relaxed here which is
what we want because this is all performance sensitive code.
