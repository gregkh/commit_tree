PM: docs: Describe high-level PM strategies and sleep states

Reorganize the power management part of admin-guide by adding a
description of major power management strategies supported by the
kernel (system-wide and working-state power management) to it and
dividing the rest of the material into the system-wide PM and
working-state PM chapters.

On top of that, add a description of system sleep states to the
system-wide PM chapter.
