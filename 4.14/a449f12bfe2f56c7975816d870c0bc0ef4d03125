dt-bindings: serial/rs485: make rs485-rts-delay optional

There are a few device trees that specify one of the already optional
properties without also having the up to now required property
rs485-rts-delay. Additionally there is no technical reason to require
rs485-rts-delay and that's also what most drivers implement.

So give existing users and implementers a blessing and document
rs485-rts-delay as optional.
