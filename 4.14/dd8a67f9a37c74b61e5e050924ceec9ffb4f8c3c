mm/huge_memory.c: deposit page table when copying a PMD migration entry

We need to deposit pre-allocated PTE page table when a PMD migration
entry is copied in copy_huge_pmd().  Otherwise, we will leak the
pre-allocated page and cause a NULL pointer dereference later in
zap_huge_pmd().

The missing counters during PMD migration entry copy process are added
as well.
