scsi: zfcp: fix erp_action use-before-initialize in REC action trace

v4.10 commit 6f2ce1c6af37 ("scsi: zfcp: fix rport unblock race with LUN
recovery") extended accessing parent pointer fields of struct
zfcp_erp_action for tracing.  If an erp_action has never been enqueued
before, these parent pointer fields are uninitialized and NULL. Examples
are zfcp objects freshly added to the parent object's children list,
before enqueueing their first recovery subsequently. In
zfcp_erp_try_rport_unblock(), we iterate such list. Accessing erp_action
fields can cause a NULL pointer dereference.  Since the kernel can read
from lowcore on s390, it does not immediately cause a kernel page
fault. Instead it can cause hangs on trying to acquire the wrong
erp_action->adapter->dbf->rec_lock in zfcp_dbf_rec_action_lvl()
                      ^bogus^
while holding already other locks with IRQs disabled.

Real life example from attaching lots of LUNs in parallel on many CPUs:

}

zfcp_erp_action is always fully embedded into its container object. Such
container object is never moved in its object tree (only add or delete).
Hence, erp_action parent pointers can never change.

To fix the issue, initialize the erp_action parent pointers before
adding the erp_action container to any list and thus before it becomes
accessible from outside of its initializing function.

In order to also close the time window between zfcp_erp_setup_act()
memsetting the entire erp_action to zero and setting the parent pointers
again, drop the memset and instead explicitly initialize individually
all erp_action fields except for parent pointers. To be extra careful
not to introduce any other unintended side effect, even keep zeroing the
erp_action fields for list and timer. Also double-check with
WARN_ON_ONCE that erp_action parent pointers never change, so we get to
know when we would deviate from previous behavior.
