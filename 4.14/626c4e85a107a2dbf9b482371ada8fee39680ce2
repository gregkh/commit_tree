dmaengine: k3dma: fix non-cyclic mode

Commit 36387a2b1f62b5c087c5fe6f0f7b23b94f722ad7 ("k3dma: Fix
memory handling in preparation for cyclic mode") broke the
logic around ds_run/ds_done in case of non-cyclic DMA.

This went unnoticed as the only user of k3dma was the i2s
audio driver but, with a patch set to enable dma on SPI, the
issue popped out.

The fix re-applies the initialization to ds_run/ds_done in
k3_dma_start_txd() that were removed by the commit above.

Also, one of the calls to k3_dma_start_txd() is triggered by
(ds_done != NULL), so remove the noisy and useless call to
WARN_ON_ONCE().
