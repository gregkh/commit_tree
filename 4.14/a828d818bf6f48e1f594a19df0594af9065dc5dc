media: v4l: mt9t001: constify video_subdev structures

The v4l2_subdev_ops structure is only passed as the third argument of
v4l2_i2c_subdev_init, which is const, so the v4l2_subdev_ops structure
can be const as well.  The other structures are only stored in the
v4l2_subdev_ops structure, all the fields of which are const, so these
structures can also be const.

Done with the help of Coccinelle.
