xen/pvcalls: implement bind command

Allocate a socket. Track the allocated passive sockets with a new data
structure named sockpass_mapping. It contains an unbound workqueue to
schedule delayed work for the accept and poll commands. It also has a
reqcopy field to be used to store a copy of a request for delayed work.
Reads/writes to it are protected by a lock (the "copy_lock" spinlock).
Initialize the workqueue in pvcalls_back_bind.

Implement the bind command with inet_bind.

The pass_sk_data_ready event handler will be added later.
