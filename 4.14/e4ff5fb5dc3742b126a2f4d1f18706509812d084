btrfs: Remove unused parameters from volume.c functions

This also adjusts the respective callers in other files. Those were
found with -Wunused-parameter.

btrfs_full_stripe_len's mapping_tree - introduced by 53b381b3abeb
("Btrfs: RAID5 and RAID6") but it was never really used even in that
commit

btrfs_is_parity_mirror's mirror_num - same as above

chunk_drange_filter's chunk_offset - introduced by 94e60d5a5c4b ("Btrfs:
devid subset filter") and never used.
