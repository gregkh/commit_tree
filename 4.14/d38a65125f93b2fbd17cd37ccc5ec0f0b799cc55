rtnetlink: init handler refcounts to 1

If using CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL=y we get following splat:
 refcount_t: increment on 0; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 304 at lib/refcount.c:152 refcount_inc+0x47/0x50
Call Trace:
 rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x191/0x260
 ...

This warning is harmless (0 is "no callback running", not "memory
was freed").

Use '1' as the new 'no handler is running' base instead of 0 to avoid
this.
