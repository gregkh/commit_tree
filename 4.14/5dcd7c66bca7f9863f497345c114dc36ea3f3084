media: media/doc: rename and reorder pixfmt files

After the DocBook conversion a number of pixfmt description files just
had a number in the filename (pix-fmt-004, 006, etc) which was not very
descriptive.

Rename them.

Note that pixfmt-008.rst was folded into colorspaces-details.rst, so
that file is deleted. It's easier to maintain that way.

Also moved the colorspace sections to the end of the chapter. The old
order was weird: the "Standard Image Formats" section (an intro into
pixel formats) was followed by the colorspace sections instead of the
pixel format descriptions.

Moving it to the end resolved that issue.
