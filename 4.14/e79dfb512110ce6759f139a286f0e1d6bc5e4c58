drm/i915: Simplify scaler init during CRTC HW readout

The crtc state starts out being bzero'd, so no need to clear
scaler_users. Also intel_crtc_init_scalers() knows already which
platforms have scalers, so no need for the platform check here.
Similarly intel_crtc_init_scalers() will init scaler_id as required,
so no need to do it here separately.
