mm: memcontrol: use int for event/state parameter in several functions

Several functions use an enum type as parameter for an event/state, but
are called in some locations with an argument of a different enum type.
Adjust the interface of these functions to reality by changing the
parameter to int.

This fixes a ton of enum-conversion warnings that are generated when
building the kernel with clang.
