net-next: dsa: add flow_dissect callback to struct dsa_device_ops

When the flow dissector first sees packets coming in on a DSA devices the
802.3 header wont be located where the code expects it to be as the tag
is still present. Adding this new callback allows a DSA device to provide a
new function that the flow_dissector can use to get the correct protocol
and offset of the network header.
