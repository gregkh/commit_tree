tty: synclink: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  51755	    400	    513	  52668	   cdbc	drivers/tty/synclink.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  51883	    304	    513	  52700	   cddc	drivers/tty/synclink.o
