x86/kconfig: Make it easier to switch to the new ORC unwinder

A couple of Kconfig changes which make it much easier to switch to the
new CONFIG_ORC_UNWINDER:

1) Remove x86 dependencies on CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER for lockdep,
   latencytop, and fault injection.  x86 has a 'guess' unwinder which
   just scans the stack for kernel text addresses.  It's not 100%
   accurate but in many cases it's good enough.  This allows those users
   who don't want the text overhead of the frame pointer or ORC
   unwinders to still use these features.  More importantly, this also
   makes it much more straightforward to disable frame pointers.

2) Make CONFIG_ORC_UNWINDER depend on !CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER.  While it
   would be possible to have both enabled, it doesn't really make sense
   to do so.  So enforce a sane configuration to prevent the user from
   making a dumb mistake.

With these changes, when you disable CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER, "make
oldconfig" will ask if you want to enable CONFIG_ORC_UNWINDER.
