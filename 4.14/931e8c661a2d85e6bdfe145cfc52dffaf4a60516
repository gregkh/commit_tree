drm/bochs: switch fb_ops over to use drm_fb_helper_cfb helpers

The current drm_fb_helper_sys helpers referenced in fb_ops assume that the
video memory is in system RAM. This is not the case for sparc which uses direct
physical memory accesses for IO memory and causes the bochs_drm module to panic
immediately upon startup as it tries to initialise the framebuffer.

Switching fb_ops over to use the drm_fb_helper_cfb helpers ensures that the
correct accesses are used on sparc, fixing the panic and allowing the
bochs_drm module to function under qemu-system-sparc64.
