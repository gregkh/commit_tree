MIPS: Make CONFIG_MIPS_MT_SMP default y

On systems that support MT ASE multithreading (ie. VPEs) we are very
likely to want to include that support as default. Rather than setting
it in various defconfigs, simply make CONFIG_MIPS_MT_SMP default y such
that systems which select CONFIG_SYS_SUPPORTS_MULTITHREADING get it by
default.

As well as allowing us to remove the selection of CONFIG_MIPS_MT_SMP
from various defconfigs, this also allows the generated generic
defconfigs which derive from generic_defconfig to automatically gain
support for MT ASE SMP when building for a suitable (pre-MIPSr6) ISA.

For malta_kvm_guest_defconfig CONFIG_MIPS_MT_SMP is explicitly disabled
since enabling SMP implicitly disables CONFIG_KVM_GUEST, which depends
on CONFIG_BROKEN_ON_SMP.
