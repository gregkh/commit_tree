perf srcline: Do not consider empty files as valid srclines

Sometimes we get a non-null, but empty, string for the filename from
bfd. This then results in srclines of the form ":0", which is different
from the canonical SRCLINE_UNKNOWN in the form "??:0".  Set the file to
NULL if it is empty to fix this.
