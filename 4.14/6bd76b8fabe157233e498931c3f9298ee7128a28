perf tools: Fix static build with newer toolchains

We can't pass --dynamic-list list into static build anymore, because
compilers starts to scream about that. Fedora 26 started to fail build
with following error:

  $ make LDFLAGS=-static
  ...
  /usr/bin/ld: dynamic STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol `strcmp' with pointer equality in `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/7/../../../../lib64/libc.a(strcmp.o
+)' can not be used when making an executable; recompile with -fPIE and relink with -pie

There's no sense for --dynamic-list in static build, because there's no
.dynsym table in static binary. Consequently the traceevent plugins have
never worked with static build, but it was quietly passed by.

To fix this in future I think we should add support to compile plugins
within the perf binary directly for static build.
