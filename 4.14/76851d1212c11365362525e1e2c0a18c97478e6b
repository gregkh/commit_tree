sock: add SOCK_ZEROCOPY sockopt

The send call ignores unknown flags. Legacy applications may already
unwittingly pass MSG_ZEROCOPY. Continue to ignore this flag unless a
socket opts in to zerocopy.

Introduce socket option SO_ZEROCOPY to enable MSG_ZEROCOPY processing.
Processes can also query this socket option to detect kernel support
for the feature. Older kernels will return ENOPROTOOPT.
