KEYS: fix writing past end of user-supplied buffer in keyring_read()

Userspace can call keyctl_read() on a keyring to get the list of IDs of
keys in the keyring.  But if the user-supplied buffer is too small, the
kernel would write the full list anyway --- which will corrupt whatever
userspace memory happened to be past the end of the buffer.  Fix it by
only filling the space that is available.
