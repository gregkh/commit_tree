zram: identify asynchronous IO's return value

For upcoming asynchronous IO like writeback, zram_rw_page should be
aware of that whether requested IO was completed or submitted
successfully, otherwise error.

For the goal, zram_bvec_rw has three return values.

-errno: returns error number
     0: IO request is done synchronously
     1: IO request is issued successfully.
