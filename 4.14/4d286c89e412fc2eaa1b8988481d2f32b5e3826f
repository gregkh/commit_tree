perf ui progress: Make sure we always define step value

Unlikely, but we could have ui_progress__init being called with total <
16, which would set the next and step variables to 0. That would force
unnecessary ui_progress__ops->update calls because 'next' would never
raise.

Forcing the next and step values to be always > 0.
