cifs: handle large EA requests more gracefully in smb2+

Update reading the EA using increasingly larger buffer sizes
until the response will fit in the buffer, or we exceed the
(arbitrary) maximum set to 64kb.

Without this change, a user is able to add more and more EAs using
setfattr until the point where the total space of all EAs exceed 2kb
at which point the user can no longer list the EAs at all
and getfattr will abort with an error.

The same issue still exists for EAs in SMB1.
