PCI: dwc: designware: Make dw_pcie_prog_*_atu_unroll() static

Helper functions dw_pcie_prog_*_atu_unroll() don't need to be in global
scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
  - symbol 'dw_pcie_prog_outbound_atu_unroll' was not declared. Should it be static?
  - symbol 'dw_pcie_prog_inbound_atu_unroll' was not declared. Should it be static?
