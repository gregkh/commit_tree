commoncap: Move cap_elevated calculation into bprm_set_creds

Instead of a separate function, open-code the cap_elevated test, which
lets us entirely remove bprm->cap_effective (to use the local "effective"
variable instead), and more accurately examine euid/egid changes via the
existing local "is_setid".

The following LTP tests were run to validate the changes:

	# ./runltp -f syscalls -s cap
	# ./runltp -f securebits
	# ./runltp -f cap_bounds
	# ./runltp -f filecaps

All kernel selftests for capabilities and exec continue to pass as well.
