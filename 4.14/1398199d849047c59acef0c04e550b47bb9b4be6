libnvdimm, btt: ensure that flags were also unchanged during a map_read

In btt_map_read, we read the map twice to make sure that the map entry
didn't change after we added it to the read tracking table. In
anticipation of expanding the use of the error bit, also make sure that
the error and zero flags are constant across the two map reads.
