ACPI/IORT: Add IORT named component memory address limits

IORT named components provide firmware configuration describing
how many address bits a given device is capable of generating
to address memory.

Add code to the kernel to retrieve memory address limits
configuration for IORT named components and configure DMA masks
accordingly.
