arm64: dts: exynos: Fix wrong label for USB 3.0 controller node

Exynos5433 has two usb 3.0 controllers: usbhost and usbdrd. usbhost
is host-only controller whereas usbdrd supports both peripheral and
host mode. "drd" means dual-role device, so usbhost cannot be labeled
with the name containing "drd". However, the label usbdrd_dwc3_0 was
used for usbhost's dwc3 node. It seems it obviously fault because TM2
and TM2E doesn't use usbhost but dr_mode property is assigned to it.

This patch assigns the proper label for two dwc3 nodes.
