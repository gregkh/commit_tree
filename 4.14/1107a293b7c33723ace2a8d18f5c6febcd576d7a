ASoC: s3c24xx_uda134x: Remove unnecessary function call

First of all,the address of pdev->dev is assigned to card->dev,then
the function platform_set_drvdata copies the value the variable card
to pdev->dev.driver_data, but when calling snd_soc_register_card,the
function dev_set_drvdata(card->dev, card) will also do the same copy
operation,so i think that the former copy operation can be removed.
