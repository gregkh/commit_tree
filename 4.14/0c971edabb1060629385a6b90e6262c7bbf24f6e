USB: usbip: remove unneeded MODULE_VERSION() usage

MODULE_VERSION is useless for in-kernel drivers, so just remove all
usage of it in the USB usbip drivers.  Along with this, the
USBIP_VERSION macros was removed as is was also pointless, as well as
printing out the driver version to the syslog at init time, which is not
necessary at all.
