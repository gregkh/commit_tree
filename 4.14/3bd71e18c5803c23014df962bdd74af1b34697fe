iommu/vt-d: Fix harmless section mismatch warning

Building with gcc-4.6 results in this warning due to
dmar_table_print_dmar_entry being inlined as in newer compiler versions:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x5c8bee): Section mismatch in reference from the function dmar_walk_remapping_entries() to the function .init.text:dmar_table_print_dmar_entry()
The function dmar_walk_remapping_entries() references
the function __init dmar_table_print_dmar_entry().
This is often because dmar_walk_remapping_entries lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of dmar_table_print_dmar_entry is wrong.

This removes the __init annotation to avoid the warning. On compilers
that don't show the warning today, this should have no impact since the
function gets inlined anyway.
