ALSA: control: code refactoring for TLV request handler to user element set

User-defined element set registers own handler to get callbacks from TLV
ioctl handler. In the handler, execution path bifurcates depending on
requests from user space. At write request, container in given buffer is
registered to the element set, or replaced old TLV data. At the read
request, the registered data is copied to user space. The command request
is not allowed.  In current implementation, function of the handler
includes codes for the two cases.

This commit adds two helper functions for these cases so that readers can
easily get the above design.
