arm64: unwind: disregard frame.sp when validating frame pointer

Currently, when unwinding the call stack, we validate the frame pointer
of each frame against frame.sp, whose value is not clearly defined, and
which makes it more difficult to link stack frames together across
different stacks. It is far better to simply check whether the frame
pointer itself points into a valid stack.
