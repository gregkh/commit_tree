powerpc/smp: Add Power9 scheduler topology

In previous generations of Power processors each core had a private L2
cache. The Power 9 processor has a slightly different design where the
L2 cache is shared among pairs of cores rather than being completely
private.

Making the scheduler aware of this cache sharing allows the scheduler to
make better migration decisions. For example, if two CPU heavy tasks
share a core then one task can be migrated to the paired core to improve
throughput. Under the existing three level topology the task could be
migrated to any core on the same chip, while with the new topology it
would be preferentially migrated to the paired core so it remains
cache-hot.
