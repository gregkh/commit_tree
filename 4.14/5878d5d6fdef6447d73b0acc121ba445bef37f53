x86/xen: Get rid of paravirt op adjust_exception_frame

When running as Xen pv-guest the exception frame on the stack contains
%r11 and %rcx additional to the other data pushed by the processor.

Instead of having a paravirt op being called for each exception type
prepend the Xen specific code to each exception entry. When running as
Xen pv-guest just use the exception entry with prepended instructions,
otherwise use the entry without the Xen specific code.
