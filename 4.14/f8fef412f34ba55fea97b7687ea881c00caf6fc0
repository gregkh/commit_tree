ASoC: atmel-classd: remove aclk clock from DT binding

Since gclk (generated-clk) is now able to determine the rate of the
audio_pll, there is no need for classd to have a direct phandle to the
audio_pll while already having a phandle to gclk.

This binding is used by no board in mainline so it is safe to be
modified.
