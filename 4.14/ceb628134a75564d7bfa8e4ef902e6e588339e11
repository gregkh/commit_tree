net: phy: Keep reporting transceiver type

With commit 2d55173e71b0 ("phy: add generic function to support
ksetting support"), we lost the ability to report the transceiver type
like we used to. Now that we have added back the transceiver type to
ethtool_link_settings, we can report it back like we used to and have no
loss of information.
