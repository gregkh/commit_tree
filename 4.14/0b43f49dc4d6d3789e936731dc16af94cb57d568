bcache: gc does not work when triggering by manual command

I try to execute the following command to trigger gc thread:
[root@localhost internal]# echo 1 > trigger_gc
But it does not work, I debug the code in gc_should_run(), It works only
if in invalidating or sectors_to_gc < 0. So set sectors_to_gc to -1 to
meet the condition when we trigger gc by manual command.
