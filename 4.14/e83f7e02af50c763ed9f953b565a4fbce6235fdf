MIPS: CPS: Have asm/mips-cps.h include CM & CPC headers

With Coherence Manager (CM) 3.5 information about the topology of the
system, which has previously only been available through & accessed from
the CM, is now also provided by the Cluster Power Controller (CPC). This
includes a new CPC_CONFIG register mirroring GCR_CONFIG, and similarly a
new CPC_Cx_CONFIG register mirroring GCR_Cx_CONFIG.

In preparation for adjusting functions such as mips_cm_numcores(), which
have previously only needed to access the CM, to also access the CPC
this patch modifies the way we use the various CPS headers. Rather than
having users include asm/mips-cm.h or asm/mips-cpc.h individually we
instead have users include asm/mips-cps.h which in turn includes
asm/mips-cm.h & asm/mips-cpc.h. This means that users will gain access
to both CM & CPC registers by including one header, and most importantly
it makes asm/mips-cps.h an ideal location for helper functions which
need to access the various components of the CPS.
