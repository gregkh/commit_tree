NFS: Don't hold the group lock when calling nfs_release_request()

That can deadlock if this is the last reference since
nfs_page_group_destroy() calls nfs_page_group_sync_on_bit().
Note that even if the page was removed from the subpage list,
the req->wb_head could still be pointing to the old head.
