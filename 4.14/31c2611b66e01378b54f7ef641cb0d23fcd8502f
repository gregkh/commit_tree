selftests: Introduce a new test case to tc testsuite

In this patchset, we fixed a tc bug. This patch adds the test case
that reproduces the bug. To run this test case, user should specify
an existing NIC device:
  # sudo ./tdc.py -d enp4s0f0

This test case belongs to category "flower". If user doesn't specify
a NIC device, the test cases belong to "flower" will not be run.

In this test case, we create 1M filters and all filters share the same
action. When destroying all filters, kernel should not panic. It takes
about 18s to run it.
