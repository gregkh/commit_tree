mm: have filemap_check_and_advance_wb_err clear AS_EIO/AS_ENOSPC

Eryu noticed that he could sometimes get a leftover error reported when
it shouldn't be on fsync with ext2 and non-journalled ext4.

The problem is that writeback_single_inode still uses filemap_fdatawait.
That picks up a previously set AS_EIO flag, which would ordinarily have
been cleared before.

Since we're mostly using this function as a replacement for
filemap_check_errors, have filemap_check_and_advance_wb_err clear AS_EIO
and AS_ENOSPC when reporting an error.  That should allow the new
function to better emulate the behavior of the old with respect to these
flags.
