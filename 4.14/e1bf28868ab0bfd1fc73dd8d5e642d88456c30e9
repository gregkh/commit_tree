staging: r8822be: fix null pointer dereferences with a null driver_adapter

The call to _rtl_dbg_trace via macro HALMAC_RT_TRACE will trigger a null
pointer deference on a null driver_adapter.  Fix this by assigning
driver_adapter earlier to halmac_adapter->driver_adapter before the tracing
call so that a non-null driver_adapter is passed instead.

I should have spotted these with an earlier patch I sent, but I overlooked
these in the rather large CoverityScan logs.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1454550, CID#1454554, CID#1454565,
CID#1454591, CID#1454598 ("Explicit null dereferenced")
