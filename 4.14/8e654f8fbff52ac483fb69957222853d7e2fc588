zram: read page from backing device

This patch enables read IO from backing device.  For the feature, it
implements two IO read functions to transfer data from backing storage.

One is asynchronous IO function and other is synchronous one.

A reason I need synchrnous IO is due to partial write which need to
complete read IO before the overwriting partial data.

We can make the partial IO's case asynchronous, too but at the moment, I
don't feel adding more complexity to support such rare use cases so want
to go with simple.
