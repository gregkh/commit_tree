dmaengine: qcom_hidma: correct overriding message

A false overriding information is being presented during boot
under this scenario.

1. First object checks for kernel command line value against zero.
2. It doesn't find it, it sets the command line variable to the
value coming from ACPI/DT.
3. Second object is being probed.
4. Second object sees that the value of kernel command line
override is non-zero, it prints an overriding message even though
value matches ACPI/DT value.

hidma-mgmt QCOM8060:03: overriding max-write-burst-bytes: 1024

Add an additional check to verify that kernel command line value
is different from the ACPI/DT value.
