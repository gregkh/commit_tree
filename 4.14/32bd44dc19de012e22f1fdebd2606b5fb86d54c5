irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix the incorrect parsing of VCPU table size

The VCPU table consists of vPE entries, and its size provides the number
of VPEs supported by GICv4 hardware. Unfortunately the maximum size of
the VPE table is not discoverable like Device table. All VLPI commands
limits the number of bits to 16 to hold VPEID, which is index into VCPU
table. Don't apply DEVID bits for VCPU table instead assume maximum bits
to 16.
