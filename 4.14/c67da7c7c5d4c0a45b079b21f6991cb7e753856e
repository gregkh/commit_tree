s390/mm: introduce defines to reflect the hardware mmu

Add various defines like e.g. _REGION1_SHIFT to reflect the hardware
mmu. We have quite a bit code that does not make use of the Linux
memory management primitives but directly modifies page, segment and
region values.

Most of this is open-coded like e.g. "1UL << 53". In order to clean
this up introduce a couple of new defines. The existing Linux memory
management defines are changed, so the mapping to the hardware
implementation is reflected.
