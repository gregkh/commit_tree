powerpc/chrp: Store the intended structure

Normally the values in the resource field and the argument to ARRAY_SIZE
in the num_resources are the same.  In this case, the value in the reousrce
field is the same as the one in the previous platform_device structure, and
appears to be a copy-paste error.  Replace the value in the resource field
with the argument to the local call to ARRAY_SIZE.
