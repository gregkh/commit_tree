ext4: fix fault handling when mounted with -o dax,ro

If an ext4 filesystem is mounted with both the DAX and read-only
options, executables on that filesystem will fail to start (claiming
'Segmentation fault') due to the fault handler returning
VM_FAULT_SIGBUS.

This is due to the DAX fault handler (see ext4_dax_huge_fault)
attempting to write to the journal when FAULT_FLAG_WRITE is set. This is
the wrong behavior for write faults which will lead to a COW page; in
particular, this fails for readonly mounts.

This change avoids journal writes for faults that are expected to COW.

It might be the case that this could be better handled in
ext4_iomap_begin / ext4_iomap_end (called via iomap_ops inside
dax_iomap_fault). These is some overlap already (e.g. grabbing journal
handles).
