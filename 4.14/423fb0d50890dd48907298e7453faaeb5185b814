MIPS: Move r2300 FP code from r2300_switch.S to r2300_fpu.S

Move _save_fp(), _restore_fp() & _init_fpu() out of r2300_switch.S &
into r2300_fpu.S. This logically places all FP-related asm code into
r2300_fpu.S & provides consistency with R4K after the preceding commit.

Besides cleaning up this will be useful for later patches which disable
FP support.
