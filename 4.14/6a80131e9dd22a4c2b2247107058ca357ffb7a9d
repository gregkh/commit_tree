ARM: dts: tps65217: Add charger interrupts to the common tps65217.dtsi file

The interrupt specifiers for USB and AC charger input are static data that
comes from the datasheet, there is no reason to need to define these values
on every board so seem reasonable put this information into the common
tps65217 file.
