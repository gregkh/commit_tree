media: staging: atomisp: mt9m114: constify acpi_device_id

acpi_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with acpi_device_id provided by <acpi/acpi_bus.h> work with
const acpi_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  15148	   2640	      8	  17796	   4584
drivers/staging/media/atomisp/i2c/mt9m114.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  15244	   2512	      8	  17764	   4564
