KEYS: don't revoke uninstantiated key in request_key_auth_new()

If key_instantiate_and_link() were to fail (which fortunately isn't
possible currently), the call to key_revoke(authkey) would crash with a
NULL pointer dereference in request_key_auth_revoke() because the key
has not yet been instantiated.

Fix this by removing the call to key_revoke().  key_put() is sufficient,
as it's not possible for an uninstantiated authkey to have been used for
anything yet.
