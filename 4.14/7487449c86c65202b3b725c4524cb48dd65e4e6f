IPv4: early demux can return an error code

Currently no error is emitted, but this infrastructure will
used by the next patch to allow source address validation
for mcast sockets.
Since early demux can do a route lookup and an ipv4 route
lookup can return an error code this is consistent with the
current ipv4 route infrastructure.
