seccomp: Operation for checking if an action is available

Userspace code that needs to check if the kernel supports a given action
may not be able to use the /proc/sys/kernel/seccomp/actions_avail
sysctl. The process may be running in a sandbox and, therefore,
sufficient filesystem access may not be available. This patch adds an
operation to the seccomp(2) syscall that allows userspace code to ask
the kernel if a given action is available.

If the action is supported by the kernel, 0 is returned. If the action
is not supported by the kernel, -1 is returned with errno set to
-EOPNOTSUPP. If this check is attempted on a kernel that doesn't support
this new operation, -1 is returned with errno set to -EINVAL meaning
that userspace code will have the ability to differentiate between the
two error cases.
