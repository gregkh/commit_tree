IB/hfi1: Move structure definitions from user_exp_rcv.c to user_exp_rcv.h

Clean up user_exp_rcv.c file by moving structure definitions into header
file user_exp_rcv.h. Since these structure definitions depend on the
structure definitions in mmu_rb.h, move #include "mmu_rb.h" above
the include "user_exp_rcv.h" or include of header files that include
user_exp_rcv.h
