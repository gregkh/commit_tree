rcutorture: Place event-traced strings into trace buffer

Strings used in event tracing need to be specially handled, for example,
being copied to the trace buffer instead of being pointed to by the trace
buffer.  Although the TPS() macro can be used to "launder" pointed-to
strings, this might not be all that effective within a loadable module.
This commit therefore copies rcutorture's strings to the trace buffer.
