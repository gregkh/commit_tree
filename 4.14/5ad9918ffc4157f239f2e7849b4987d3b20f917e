xen/pvcalls: implement write

When the other end notifies us that there is data to be written
(pvcalls_back_conn_event), increment the io and write counters, and
schedule the ioworker.

Implement the write function called by ioworker by reading the data from
the data ring, writing it to the socket by calling inet_sendmsg.

Set out_error on error.
