hwmon: (aspeed-pwm-tacho) cooling device support.

Add support in aspeed-pwm-tacho driver for cooling device creation.
This cooling device could be bound to a thermal zone
for the thermal control. Device will appear in /sys/class/thermal
folder as cooling_deviceX. Then it could be bound to particular
thermal zones. Allow specification of the cooling levels
vector - PWM duty cycle values in a range from 0 to 255
which correspond to thermal cooling states.
