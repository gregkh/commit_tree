iwlwifi: fw: fix lar_enabled endian problem in iwl_fw_get_nvm

We read the regulatory.lar_enabled field in iwl_fw_get_nvm() and store
it in nvm->lar_enabled, taking care of endianness.  But then later we
read it again to pass the value to iwl_init_sbands() without handling
endianness.  To solve this, simply reuse nvm->lar_enabled when calling
that function.
