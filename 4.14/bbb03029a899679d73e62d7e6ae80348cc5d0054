strparser: Generalize strparser

Generalize strparser from more than just being used in conjunction
with read_sock. strparser will also be used in the send path with
zero proxy. The primary change is to create strp_process function
that performs the critical processing on skbs. The documentation
is also updated to reflect the new uses.
