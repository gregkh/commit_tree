MIPS: Move r4k FP code from r4k_switch.S to r4k_fpu.S

Move _save_fp(), _restore_fp(), _save_msa(), _restore_msa(),
_init_msa_upper() & _init_fpu() out of r4k_switch.S & into r4k_fpu.S.
This allows us to clean up the way in which Octeon includes the default
r4k implementations of these FP functions despite replacing resume(),
and makes CONFIG_R4K_FPU more straightforwardly represent all
configurations that have an R4K-style FPU, including Octeon.

Besides cleaning up this will be useful for later patches which disable
FP support.
