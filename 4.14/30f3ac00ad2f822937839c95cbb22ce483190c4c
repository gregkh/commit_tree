arm64: hugetlb: Handle swap entries in huge_pte_offset() for contiguous hugepages

huge_pte_offset() was updated to correctly handle swap entries for
hugepages. With the addition of the size parameter, it is now possible
to disambiguate whether the request is for a regular hugepage or a
contiguous hugepage.

Fix huge_pte_offset() for contiguous hugepages by using the size to find
the correct page table entry.
