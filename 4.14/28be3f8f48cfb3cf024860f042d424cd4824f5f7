kselftests: timers: set-timer-lat: Add one-shot timer test cases

These testcases are motivated by a recent alarmtimer regression, which
caused one-shot CLOCK_{BOOTTIME,REALTIME}_ALARM timers to become
periodic timers.

The new testcases are very similar to the existing testcases for
repeating timers.  But rather than waiting for 5 alarms, they wait for 5
seconds and verify that the alarm fired exactly once.
