staging: r8822be: Add existing rtlwifi and rtl_pci parts for new driver

The RTL8822BE, an 802.11ac wireless network card, is now appearing in
new computers. Its driver is being placed in staging to reduce the time
that users of this new card will have access to in-kernel drivers.

This commit copies the code that currently constitutes the rtlwifi and
rtl_pci mini drivers. This material is copied into staging to prevent
any undo interaction between the existing drivers and this new one.
The only changes in this code are the removal of all export statements,
and the fixing of some checkpatch messages. The latter will be backported
into the wireless tree.
