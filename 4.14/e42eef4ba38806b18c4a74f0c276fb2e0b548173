KVM: add X86_LOCAL_APIC dependency

The rework of the posted interrupt handling broke building without
support for the local APIC:

ERROR: "boot_cpu_physical_apicid" [arch/x86/kvm/kvm-intel.ko] undefined!

That configuration is probably not particularly useful anyway, so
we can avoid the randconfig failures by adding a Kconfig dependency.
