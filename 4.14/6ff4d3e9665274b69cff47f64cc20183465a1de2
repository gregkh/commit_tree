powerpc: Remove old unused icswx based coprocessor support

We have a whole pile of unused code to maintain the ACOP register,
allocate coprocessor PIDs and handle ACOP faults. This mechanism
was used for the HFI adapter on POWER7 which is dead and gone and
whose driver never went upstream. It was used on some A2 core based
stuff that also never saw the light of day.

Take out all that code.

There is still some POWER8 coprocessor code that uses icswx but it's
kernel only and thus doesn't use any of that infrastructure.
