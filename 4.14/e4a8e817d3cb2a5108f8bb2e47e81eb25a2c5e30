bpf: misc xdp redirect cleanups

Few cleanups including: bpf_redirect_map() is really XDP only due to
the return code. Move it to a more appropriate location where we do
the XDP redirect handling and change it's name into bpf_xdp_redirect_map()
to make it consistent to the bpf_xdp_redirect() helper.

xdp_do_redirect_map() helper can be static since only used out of filter.c
file. Drop the goto in xdp_do_generic_redirect() and only return errors
directly. In xdp_do_flush_map() only clear ri->map_to_flush which is the
arg we're using in that function, ri->map is cleared earlier along with
ri->ifindex.
