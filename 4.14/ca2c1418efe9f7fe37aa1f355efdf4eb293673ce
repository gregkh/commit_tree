udp: drop head states only when all skb references are gone

After commit 0ddf3fb2c43d ("udp: preserve skb->dst if required
for IP options processing") we clear the skb head state as soon
as the skb carrying them is first processed.

Since the same skb can be processed several times when MSG_PEEK
is used, we can end up lacking the required head states, and
eventually oopsing.

Fix this clearing the skb head state only when processing the
last skb reference.
