media: drop use of MEDIA_API_VERSION

Set media_version to LINUX_VERSION_CODE, just as we did for
driver_version.

Nobody ever rememebers to update the version number, but
LINUX_VERSION_CODE will always be updated.

Move the MEDIA_API_VERSION define to the ifndef __KERNEL__ section of the
media.h header. That way kernelspace can't accidentally start to use
it again.
