ARM: 8716/1: pass endianness info to sparse

ARM depends on the macros '__ARMEL__' & '__ARMEB__' being defined
or not to correctly select or define endian-specific macros,
structures or pieces of code.

These macros are predefined by the compiler but sparse knows
nothing about them and thus may pre-process files differently
from what gcc would.

Fix this by passing '-D__ARMEL__' or '-D__ARMEB__' to sparse,
depending on the endianness of the kernel, like defined by GCC.

Note: In most case it won't change anything since most ARMs use
      little-endian (but an allyesconfig would use big-endian!).
