media: staging: atomisp: Use kvfree() instead of kfree()/vfree()

Conditionally calling kfree()/vfree() can be replaced by a call to
kvfree() which handles both kmalloced memory and vmalloced memory.
The resulting wrapper function has been replaced with direct calls
to kvfree().

This change was made with the help of the following Coccinelle
semantic patch:
//<smpl>
@@
expression a;
@@
- if(...) { vfree(a); }
- else { kfree(a); }
+ kvfree(a);
// </smpl>
