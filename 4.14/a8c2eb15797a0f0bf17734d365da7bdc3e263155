net/mlx5e: Stop NAPI when irq balancer changes affinity

NAPI context keeps rescheduling on same CPU as long as it's busy.
This doesn't give the oppurtunity for changes in irq affinities
to take effect.
Fix that by calling napi_complete_done() upon a change in affinity.
This would stop the NAPI and reschedule it on the new CPU.
