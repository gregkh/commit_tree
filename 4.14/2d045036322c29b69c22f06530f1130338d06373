cpufreq: governor: Drop min_sampling_rate

The cpufreq core and governors aren't supposed to set a limit on how
fast we want to try changing the frequency. This is currently done for
the legacy governors with help of min_sampling_rate.

At worst, we may end up setting the sampling rate to a value lower than
the rate at which frequency can be changed and then one of the CPUs in
the policy will be only changing frequency for ever.

But that is something for the user to decide and there is no need to
have special handling for such cases in the core. Leave it for the user
to figure out.
