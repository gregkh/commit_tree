scsi: sd: Do not override max_sectors_kb sysfs setting

A user may lower the max_sectors_kb setting in sysfs to accommodate
certain workloads. Previously we would always set the max I/O size to
either the block layer default or the optional preferred I/O size
reported by the device.

Keep the current heuristics for the initial setting of max_sectors_kb.
For subsequent invocations, only update the current queue limit if it
exceeds the capabilities of the hardware.
