Revert commit 1a8b6d76dc5b ("net:add one common config...")

The new flag PCI_DEV_FLAGS_NO_RELAXED_ORDERING has been added
to indicate that Relaxed Ordering Attributes (RO) should not
be used for Transaction Layer Packets (TLP) targeted toward
these affected Root Port, it will clear the bit4 in the PCIe
Device Control register, so the PCIe device drivers could
query PCIe configuration space to determine if it can send
TLPs to Root Port with the Relaxed Ordering Attributes set.

With this new flag  we don't need the config ARCH_WANT_RELAX_ORDER
to control the Relaxed Ordering Attributes for the ixgbe drivers
just like the commit 1a8b6d76dc5b ("net:add one common config...") did,
so revert this commit.
