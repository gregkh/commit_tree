s390/vmcp: make use of contiguous memory allocator

If memory is fragmented it is unlikely that large order memory
allocations succeed. This has been an issue with the vmcp device
driver since a long time, since it requires large physical contiguous
memory ares for large responses.

To hopefully resolve this issue make use of the contiguous memory
allocator (cma). This patch adds a vmcp specific vmcp cma area with a
default size of 4MB. The size can be changed either via the
VMCP_CMA_SIZE config option at compile time or with the "vmcp_cma"
kernel parameter (e.g. "vmcp_cma=16m").

For any vmcp response buffers larger than 16k memory from the cma area
will be allocated. If such an allocation fails, there is a fallback to
the buddy allocator.
