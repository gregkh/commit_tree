net: phy: Kconfig: Fix PHY infrastructure menu in menuconfig

Since the integration of PHYLINK, the configuration option which
used to be under the PHY infrastructure menu in menuconfig ended
up one level up (the network device driver section)

By placing PHYLINK option right after PHYLIB entry, it broke the
way Kconfig used to build the menu. See kconfig-language.txt, section
"Menu structure", 2nd method.

This is fixed by placing the PHYLINK option just before PHYLIB.
