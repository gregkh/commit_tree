staging: lustre: libcfs: fix test for libcfs_ioctl_hdr minimum size

The function libcfs_ioctl_getdata() test to see if libcfs_ioctl_hdr
is smaller than struct libcfs_ioctl_data in size. This is wrong
and it breaks the ioctl that is used to collect LNet stats. The
correct size to compare against is struct libcfs_ioctl_hdr.
