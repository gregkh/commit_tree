s390/dasd: Change unsigned long long to unsigned long

Unsigned long long and unsigned long were different in size for 31-bit.
For 64-bit the size for both datatypes is 8 Bytes and since the support
for 31-bit is long gone we can clean up a little and change everything
to unsigned long.
Change get_phys_clock() along the way to accept unsigned long as well so
that the DASD code can be consistent.
