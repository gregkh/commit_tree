powerpc/pseries: Don't print failure message in energy driver

This driver currently reports the H_BEST_ENERGY hypervisor call is
unsupported (even when booting in a non-virtualised environment). This
is not something the administrator can do much with, and not
significant for debugging.

Remove it.
