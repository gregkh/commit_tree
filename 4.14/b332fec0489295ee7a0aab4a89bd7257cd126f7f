MIPS: microMIPS: Fix detection of addiusp instruction

The addiusp instruction uses the pool16d opcode, with bit 0 of the
immediate set. The test for the addiusp opcode erroneously did a logical
and of the immediate with mm_addiusp_func, which has value 1, so this
test always passes when the immediate is non-zero.

Fix the test by replacing the logical and with a bitwise and.
