KVM: MMU: Rename PT64_ROOT_LEVEL to PT64_ROOT_4LEVEL.

Now we have 4 level page table and 5 level page table in 64 bits
long mode, let's rename the PT64_ROOT_LEVEL to PT64_ROOT_4LEVEL,
then we can use PT64_ROOT_5LEVEL for 5 level page table, it's
helpful to make the code more clear.

Also PT64_ROOT_MAX_LEVEL is defined as 4, so that we can just
redefine it to 5 whenever a replacement is needed for 5 level
paging.
