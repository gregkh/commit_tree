sched: Use __qdisc_drop instead of kfree_skb in sch_prio and sch_qfq

The commit 520ac30f4551 ("net_sched: drop packets after root qdisc lock
is released) made a big change of tc for performance. There are two points
left in sch_prio and sch_qfq which are not changed with that commit. Now
enhance them now with __qdisc_drop.
