dmaengine: bcm-sba-raid: Common flags for sba_request state and fence

This patch merges sba_request state and fence into common
sba_request flags. The sba_request flags not only saves
memory but it can also be extended in-future without adding
new members.

We also make each sba_request state as separate bit in
sba_request flags to help debugging situations where a
sba_request is accidently in two states.
