drm/i915/cnl: Don't trust VBT's alternate pin for port D for now.

Cannon Lake's VBT that is currently available for B0 stepping
states that port D uses alternate pin 3 messing up with the
default pin-port mapping table. Using that information we cannot
get HDMI working properly. So for now we don't relly on VBT for
this information.
