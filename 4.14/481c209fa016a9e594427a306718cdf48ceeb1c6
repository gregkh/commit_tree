Input: axp20x-pek - fix module not auto-loading for axp221 pek

Now that we have a platform_device_id table and multiple supported ids
we should be using MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE instead of MODULE_ALIAS.

This fixes a regression on Bay and Cherry Trail devices, where the power
button is now enumerated as an "axp221-pek" and it was impossible to
wakeup these devices from suspend since the module did not load.
