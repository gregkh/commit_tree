netvsc: make sure and unregister datapath

Go back to switching datapath directly in the notifier callback.
Otherwise datapath might not get switched on unregister.

No need for calling the NOTIFY_PEERS notifier since that is only for
a gratitious ARP/ND packet; but that is not required with Hyper-V
because both VF and synthetic NIC have the same MAC address.
