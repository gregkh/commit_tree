powerpc/8xx: Remove macro that checks kernel address

The macro to check if an address is a kernel address or not is
not used anymore in DTLBmiss handler. It is used in ITLB miss handler
and in DTLB error handler. DTLB error handler is not a hot path, it
doesn't need such optimisation.

In order to simplify a following patch which will rework ITLB miss
handler, we remove the macros and reintroduce them inside the handler.
