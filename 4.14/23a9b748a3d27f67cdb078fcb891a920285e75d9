sched: Replace spin_unlock_wait() with lock/unlock pair

There is no agreed-upon definition of spin_unlock_wait()'s semantics,
and it appears that all callers could do just as well with a lock/unlock
pair.  This commit therefore replaces the spin_unlock_wait() call in
do_task_dead() with spin_lock() followed immediately by spin_unlock().
This should be safe from a performance perspective because the lock is
this tasks ->pi_lock, and this is called only after the task exits.
