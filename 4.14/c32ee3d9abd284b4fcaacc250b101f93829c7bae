bitops: avoid integer overflow in GENMASK(_ULL)

GENMASK(_ULL) performs a left-shift of ~0UL(L), which technically
results in an integer overflow.  clang raises a warning if the overflow
occurs in a preprocessor expression.  Clear the low-order bits through a
substraction instead of the left-shift to avoid the overflow.

(akpm: no change in .text size in my testing)
