irqchip/gic-v3-its: Macro-ize its_send_single_command

Most ITS commands do operate on a collection object, and require
a SYNC command to be performed on that collection in order to
guarantee the execution of the first command.

With GICv4 ITS, another set of commands perform similar operations
on a VPE object, and a VSYNC operations must be executed to guarantee
their execution.

Given the similarities (post a command, perform a synchronization
operation on a sync object), it makes sense to reuse the same
mechanism for both class of commands.

Let's start with turning its_send_single_command into a huge macro
that performs the bulk of the work, and a set of helpers that
make this macro usable for the GICv3 ITS commands.
