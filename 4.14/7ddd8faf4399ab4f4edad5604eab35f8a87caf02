userfaultfd: selftest: exercise -EEXIST only in background transfer

I was stress testing some backports and with high load, after some time,
the latest version of the selftest showed some false positive in
connection with the uffdio_copy_retry.  This seems to fix it while still
exercising -EEXIST in the background transfer once in a while.

The fork child will quit after the last UFFDIO_COPY is run, so a
repeated UFFDIO_COPY may not return -EEXIST.  This change restricts the
-EEXIST stress to the background transfer where the memory can't go away
from under it.

Also updated uffdio_zeropage, so the interface is consistent.
