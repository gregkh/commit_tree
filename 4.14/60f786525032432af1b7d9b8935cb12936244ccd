net: mdio-mux: fix unbalanced put_device

mdio_mux_uninit() call put_device (unconditionally) because of
of_mdio_find_bus() in mdio_mux_init.
But of_mdio_find_bus is only called if mux_bus is empty.
If mux_bus is set, mdio_mux_uninit will print a "refcount_t: underflow"
trace.

This patch add a get_device in the other branch of "if (mux_bus)".
