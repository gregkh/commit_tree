ACPICA: Tables: Combine checksum/duplication verification together

ACPICA commit 182bdffc0644f568be614a6d4debd651e29ca587

They are all mechanisms used to verify if a table is qualified to be
installed and controlled by acpi_gbl_enable_table_validation, so combine them
together. By doing so, table duplication check is applied to the statically
loaded tables (however whether it is actually enabled is still determined
by acpi_gbl_enable_table_validation). Lv Zheng.
