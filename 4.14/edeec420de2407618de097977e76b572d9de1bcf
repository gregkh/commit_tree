cpufreq: dt-platdev: Automatically create cpufreq device with OPP v2

The initial idea of creating the cpufreq-dt-platdev.c file was to keep a
list of platforms that use the "operating-points" (V1) bindings and
create cpufreq device for them only, as we weren't sure which platforms
would want the device to get created automatically as some had their own
cpufreq drivers as well, or wanted to initialize cpufreq after doing
some stuff from platform code.

But that wasn't the case with platforms using "operating-points-v2"
property. We wanted the device to get created automatically without the
need of adding them to the whitelist. Though, we will still have some
exceptions where we don't want to create the device automatically.

Rename the earlier platform list as *whitelist* and create a new
*blacklist* as well.

The cpufreq-dt device will get created if:
- The platform is there in the whitelist OR
- The platform has "operating-points-v2" property in CPU0's DT node and
  isn't part of the blacklist .
