coresight tmc: Support for save-restore in ETR

The Coresight SoC 600 TMC ETR supports save-restore feature,
where the values of the RRP/RWP and STS.Full are retained
when it leaves the Disabled state. Hence, we must program the
RRP/RWP and STS.Full to a proper value. For now, set the RRP/RWP
to the base address of the buffer and clear the STS.Full register.
This can be later exploited for proper save-restore of ETR
trace contexts (e.g, perf).
