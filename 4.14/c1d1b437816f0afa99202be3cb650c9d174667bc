net: convert (struct ubuf_info)->refcnt to refcount_t

refcount_t type and corresponding API should be
used instead of atomic_t when the variable is used as
a reference counter. This allows to avoid accidental
refcounter overflows that might lead to use-after-free
situations.

v2: added the change in drivers/vhost/net.c as spotted
by Willem.
