irqchip/ls-scfg-msi: Add LS1046a MSI support

LS1046a includes 4 MSIRs, each MSIR is assigned a dedicate GIC
SPI interrupt and provides 32 MSI interrupts. Compared to previous
MSI, LS1046a's IBS(interrupt bit select) shift is changed to 2 and
total MSI interrupt number is changed to 128.

The patch adds structure 'ls_scfg_msir' to describe MSIR setting and
'ibs_shift' to store the different value between the SoCs.
