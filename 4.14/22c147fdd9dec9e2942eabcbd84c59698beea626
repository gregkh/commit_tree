staging: lustre: uapi: Move functions out of lustre_idl.h

Migrate functions set/get_mrc_cr_flags, ldlm_res_eq
ldlm_extent_overlap, ldlm_extent_contain,
ldlm_request_bufsize, and all the PTLRPC dump_*
functions out of lustre_idl.h which is a UAPI header
to the places in the kernel code they are actually used.
Delete unused lmv_mds_md_stripe_count and
agent_req_in_final_state.
