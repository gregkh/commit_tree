staging: fsl-mc: add explicit dependencies for compile-tested arches

The driver makes use of GENERIC_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN which requires arch
support so, on architectures that don't have it, the kernel will fail
to build. Add explicit dependency on architectures that were
compile-tested, thus fixing compilation for the ones that don't
implement GENERIC_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN.
