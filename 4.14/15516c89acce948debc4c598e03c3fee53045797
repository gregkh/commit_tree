tracing: Remove RCU work arounds from stack tracer

Currently the stack tracer calls rcu_irq_enter() to make sure RCU
is watching when it records a stack trace. But if the stack tracer
is triggered while tracing inside of a rcu_irq_enter(), calling
rcu_irq_enter() unconditionally can be problematic.

The reason for having rcu_irq_enter() in the first place has been
fixed from within the saving of the stack trace code, and there's no
reason for doing it in the stack tracer itself. Just remove it.
