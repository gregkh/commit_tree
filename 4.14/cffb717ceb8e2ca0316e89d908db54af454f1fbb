powerpc/xive: Ensure active irqd when setting affinity

Ensure irqd is active before attempting to set affinity. This should
make the set affinity code more robust. For instance, this prevents
these messages seen on a 4.12 based kernel when taking cpus offline:

   [  123.053037264,3] XIVE[ IC 00  ] ISN 2 lead to invalid IVE !
   [   77.885859] xive: Error -6 reconfiguring irq 17
   [   77.885862] IRQ17: set affinity failed(-6).

That particular case has been fixed in 4.13-rc1 by commit
91f26cb4cd3c ("genirq/cpuhotplug: Do not migrated shutdown irqs").
