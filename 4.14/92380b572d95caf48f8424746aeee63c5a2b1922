HID: wacom: generic: Clear ABS_MISC when tool leaves proximity

The tool ID information sent in ABS_MISC is expected to be reset to 0
when a tool leaves proximity. Not doing this can cause problems if a
tool is removed and then re-introduced. Kernel event filtering will
prevent the (identical) ABS_MISC event from being sent when the tool
re-enters proxmity. This can cause userspace to not properly set the
tool ID.
