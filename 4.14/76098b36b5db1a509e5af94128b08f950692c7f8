firmware: send -EINTR on signal abort on fallback mechanism

Right now we send -EAGAIN to a syfs write which got interrupted.
Userspace can't tell what happened though, send -EINTR if we
were killed due to a signal so userspace can tell things apart.

This is only applicable to the fallback mechanism.
