mlxsw: spectrum_router: Add mlxsw_sp_ipip_ops

Details of individual tunnel types are kept in an array of
mlxsw_sp_ipip_ops objects. Follow-up patches will use the list to
determine whether a constructed RIF should be a loopback, and to decide
whether a next hop references a tunnel.

The list is currently empty, follow-up patches will add support for GRE.
