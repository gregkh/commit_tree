mm: x86: move _PAGE_SWP_SOFT_DIRTY from bit 7 to bit 1

_PAGE_PSE is used to distinguish between a truly non-present
(_PAGE_PRESENT=0) PMD, and a PMD which is undergoing a THP split and
should be treated as present.

But _PAGE_SWP_SOFT_DIRTY currently uses the _PAGE_PSE bit, which would
cause confusion between one of those PMDs undergoing a THP split, and a
soft-dirty PMD.  Dropping _PAGE_PSE check in pmd_present() does not work
well, because it can hurt optimization of tlb handling in thp split.

Thus, we need to move the bit.

In the current kernel, bits 1-4 are not used in non-present format since
commit 00839ee3b299 ("x86/mm: Move swap offset/type up in PTE to work
around erratum").  So let's move _PAGE_SWP_SOFT_DIRTY to bit 1.  Bit 7
is used as reserved (always clear), so please don't use it for other
purpose.
