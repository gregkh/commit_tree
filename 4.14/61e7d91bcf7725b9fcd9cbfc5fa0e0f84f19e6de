iwlwifi: mvm: handle FIF_ALLMULTI when setting multicast addresses

We were ignoring the FIF_ALLMULTI flag when setting the multicast
addresses with MCAST_FILTER_CMD.  Check if this flag is set and enable
pass_all accordingly.  We also need to set the count to 0 if pass_all
is enable so we don't pass addresses to the firmware when not needed
(as doing so causes an assert).
