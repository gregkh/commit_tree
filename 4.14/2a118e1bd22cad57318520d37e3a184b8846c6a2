perf vendor events powerpc: Remove duplicate events

Some POWER PMU event names have multiple/alternate event codes. These
alternate event codes were listed in the POWER9 JSON files for
reference.

But the perf tool does not seem to handle duplicates cleanly. 'perf
list' shows such duplicate events only once, but 'perf stat' ends up
counting the first event code twice, multiplexing if necessary and we
end up with double the event counts.

Remove the duplicate event codes from the JSON files for now.
