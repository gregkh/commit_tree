rpmsg: glink: initialize ret to zero to ensure error status check is correct

The new switch cases for RPM_CMD_RX_DONE, RPM_CMD_RX_DONE_W_REUSE,
RPM_CMD_RX_INTENT_REQ_ACK, RPM_CMD_INTENT and RPM_CMD_RX_INTENT_REQ from
4 recent commits are not setting ret and so a later non-zero check on ret
is testing on a garbage value in ret. Fix this by initializing ret to zero.
