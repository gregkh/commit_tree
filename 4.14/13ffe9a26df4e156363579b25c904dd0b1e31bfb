staging: iio: ade7759: fix signed extension bug on shift of a u8

The current shift of st->rx[2] left shifts a u8 24 bits left,
promotes the integer to a an int and then to a unsigned u64. If
the top bit of st->rx[2] is set then we end up with all the upper
bits being set to 1. Fix this by casting st->rx[2] to a u64 before
the 24 bit left shift.
