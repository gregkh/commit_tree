Revert "net_sched: hold netns refcnt for each action"

This reverts commit ceffcc5e254b450e6159f173e4538215cebf1b59.
If we hold that refcnt, the netns can never be destroyed until
all actions are destroyed by user, this breaks our netns design
which we expect all actions are destroyed when we destroy the
whole netns.
