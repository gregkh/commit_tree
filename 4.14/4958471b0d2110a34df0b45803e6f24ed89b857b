ASoC: soc-core: Allow searching dai driver name in snd_soc_find_dai

Currently we are searching dai name in snd_soc_find_dai, which could
either be dai driver name or component device name(for legacy naming).

Allow searching dai driver name in snd_soc_find_dai too, so that we can
use dai driver name to find legacy naming dais.
