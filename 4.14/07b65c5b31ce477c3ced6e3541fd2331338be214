test: add msg_zerocopy test

Introduce regression test for msg_zerocopy feature. Send traffic from
one process to another with and without zerocopy.

Evaluate tcp, udp, raw and packet sockets, including variants
- udp: corking and corking with mixed copy/zerocopy calls
- raw: with and without hdrincl
- packet: at both raw and dgram level

Test on both ipv4 and ipv6, optionally with ethtool changes to
disable scatter-gather, tx checksum or tso offload. All of these
can affect zerocopy behavior.

The regression test can be run on a single machine if over a veth
pair. Then skb_orphan_frags_rx must be modified to be identical to
skb_orphan_frags to allow forwarding zerocopy locally.

The msg_zerocopy.sh script will setup the veth pair in network
namespaces and run all tests.
