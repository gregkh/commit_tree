Btrfs: do not reset bio->bi_ops while writing bio

flush_epd_write_bio() sets bio->bi_opf by itself to honor REQ_SYNC,
but it's not needed at all since bio->bi_opf has set up properly in
both __extent_writepage() and write_one_eb(), and in the case of
write_one_eb(), it also sets REQ_META, which we will lose in
flush_epd_write_bio().

This remove this unnecessary bio->bi_opf setting.
