irqchip: mips-gic: Use pcpu_masks to avoid reading GIC_SH_MASK*

This patch avoids the need to read the GIC_SH_MASK* registers when
decoding shared interrupts by setting & clearing the interrupt's bit in
the appropriate CPU's pcpu_masks entry when masking or unmasking the
interrupt.

This effectively means that whilst an interrupt is masked we clear its
bit in all pcpu_masks, which causes gic_handle_shared_int() to ignore it
on all CPUs without needing to check GIC_SH_MASK*.

In essence, we add a little overhead to masking or unmasking interrupts
but in return reduce the overhead of the far more common task of
decoding interrupts.
