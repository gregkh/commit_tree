Revert "x86: CPU: Fix up "cpu MHz" in /proc/cpuinfo"

This reverts commit 941f5f0f6ef5338814145cf2b813cf1f98873e2f.

Sadly, it turns out that we really can't just do the cross-CPU IPI to
all CPU's to get their proper frequencies, because it's much too
expensive on systems with lots of cores.

So we'll have to revert this for now, and revisit it using a smarter
model (probably doing one system-wide IPI at open time, and doing all
the frequency calculations in parallel).
