phy: rockchip-typec: Check for errors from tcphy_phy_init()

The function tcphy_phy_init() could return an error but the callers
weren't checking the return value.  They should.  In at least one case
while testing I saw the message "wait pma ready timeout" which
indicates that tcphy_phy_init() really could return an error and we
should account for it.
