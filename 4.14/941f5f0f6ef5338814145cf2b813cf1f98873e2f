x86: CPU: Fix up "cpu MHz" in /proc/cpuinfo

Commit 890da9cf0983 (Revert "x86: do not use cpufreq_quick_get() for
/proc/cpuinfo "cpu MHz"") is not sufficient to restore the previous
behavior of "cpu MHz" in /proc/cpuinfo on x86 due to some changes
made after the commit it has reverted.

To address this, make the code in question use arch_freq_get_on_cpu()
which also is used by cpufreq for reporting the current frequency of
CPUs and since that function doesn't really depend on cpufreq in any
way, drop the CONFIG_CPU_FREQ dependency for the object file
containing it.

Also refactor arch_freq_get_on_cpu() somewhat to avoid IPIs and
return cached values right away if it is called very often over a
short time (to prevent user space from triggering IPI storms through
it).
