i40evf: Use le32_to_cpu before evaluating HW desc fields

i40e hardware descriptor fields are in little-endian format. Driver
must use le32_to_cpu while evaluating these fields otherwise on
big-endian arch we end up evaluating incorrect values, cause errors
like:
i40evf 0000:03:0a.0: Expected response 24 from PF, received 402653184
i40evf 0000:03:0a.1: Expected response 7 from PF, received 117440512
