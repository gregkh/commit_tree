xfrm: don't call xfrm_policy_cache_flush under xfrm_state_lock

I might be wrong but it doesn't look like xfrm_state_lock is required
for xfrm_policy_cache_flush and calling it under this lock triggers both
"sleeping function called from invalid context" and "possible circular
locking dependency detected" warnings on flush.

Fixes: ec30d78c14a8 xfrm: add xdst pcpu cache
