PM / s2idle: Invoke the ->wake() platform callback earlier

The role of the ->wake() platform callback for suspend-to-idle is to
deal with possible spurious wakeups, among other things.  The ACPI
implementation of it, acpi_s2idle_wake(), additionally checks the
conditions for entering the Low Power S0 Idle state by the platform
and reports the ones that have not been met.

However, the ->wake() platform callback is invoked after calling
dpm_noirq_resume_devices(), which means that the power states of some
devices may have changed since s2idle_enter() returned, so some unmet
Low Power S0 Idle conditions may be reported incorrectly as a result
of that.

To avoid these false positives, reorder the invocations of the
dpm_noirq_resume_devices() routine and the ->wake() platform callback
in s2idle_loop().
