bpf: reuse tc bpf prologue for sk skb progs

Given both program types are effecitvely doing the same in the
prologue, just reuse the one that we had for tc and only adapt
to the corresponding drop verdict value. That way, we don't need
to have the duplicate from 8a31db561566 ("bpf: add access to sock
fields and pkt data from sk_skb programs") to maintain.
