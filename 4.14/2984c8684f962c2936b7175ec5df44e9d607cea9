nullb: factor disk parameters

When we switch to configfs interface, each disk could have different
configuration. To prepare for the change, we move most disk setting to a
separate data structure. The existing module parameter interface is
kept. The 'nr_devices' and 'shared_tags' don't make sense for per-disk
setting, so they are remained as global settings.
