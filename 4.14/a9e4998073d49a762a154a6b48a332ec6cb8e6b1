media: dvb_frontend: ensure that inital front end status initialized

The fe_status variable s is not initialized meaning it can have any
random garbage status.  This could be problematic if fe->ops.tune is
false as s is not updated by the call to fe->ops.tune() and a
subsequent check on the change status will using a garbage value.
Fix this by adding FE_NONE to the enum fe_status and initializing
s to this.
