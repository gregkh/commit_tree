xdp: separate xdp_redirect tracepoint in map case

Creating as specific xdp_redirect_map variant of the xdp tracepoints
allow users to write simpler/faster BPF progs that get attached to
these tracepoints.

Goal is to still keep the tracepoints in xdp_redirect and xdp_redirect_map
similar enough, that a tool can read the top part of the TP_STRUCT and
produce similar monitor statistics.
