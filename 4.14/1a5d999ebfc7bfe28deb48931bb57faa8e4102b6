scsi: zfcp: fix missing trace records for early returns in TMF eh handlers

For problem determination we need to see that we were in scsi_eh
as well as whether and why we were successful or not.

The following commits introduced new early returns without adding
a trace record:

v2.6.35 commit a1dbfddd02d2
("[SCSI] zfcp: Pass return code from fc_block_scsi_eh to scsi eh")
on fc_block_scsi_eh() returning != 0 which is FAST_IO_FAIL,

v2.6.30 commit 63caf367e1c9
("[SCSI] zfcp: Improve reliability of SCSI eh handlers in zfcp")
on not having gotten an FSF request after the maximum number of retry
attempts and thus could not issue a TMF and has to return FAILED.
