btrfs: Make flush_space return void

The return value of flush_space was used to have significance in the
early days when the code was first introduced and before the ticketed
enospc rework. Since the latter got introduced the return value lost any
significance whatsoever to its callers. So let's remove it. While at it
also remove the unused ticket variable in
btrfs_async_reclaim_metadata_space. It was used in the initial version
of the ticketed ENOSPC work, however Wang Xiaoguang detected a problem
with this and fixed it in ce129655c9d9 ("btrfs: introduce tickets_id to
determine whether asynchronous metadata reclaim work makes progress").
