PM: core: Fix device_pm_check_callbacks()

The device_pm_check_callbacks() function doesn't check legacy
->suspend and ->resume callback pointers under the device's
bus type, class and driver, so in some cases it may set the
no_pm_callbacks flag for the device incorrectly and then the
callbacks may be skipped during system suspend/resume, which
shouldn't happen.

Fixes: aa8e54b55947 (PM / sleep: Go direct_complete if driver has no callbacks)
