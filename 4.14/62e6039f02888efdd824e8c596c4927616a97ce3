perf tools: Add tools/include/uapi/asm-generic/fcntl.h to the MANIFEST

This file was copied from the kernel so that we could build tools/perf/
on older systems where some newer defines, such as these are available:

    CC       trace/beauty/fcntl.o
  trace/beauty/fcntl.c: In function ‘syscall_arg__scnprintf_fcntl_arg’:
  trace/beauty/fcntl.c:93:13: error: ‘F_OFD_SETLK’ undeclared (first use in this function)
        cmd == F_OFD_SETLK || cmd == F_OFD_SETLKW || cmd == F_OFD_GETLK ||
               ^
  trace/beauty/fcntl.c:93:13: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
  trace/beauty/fcntl.c:93:35: error: ‘F_OFD_SETLKW’ undeclared (first use in this function)
        cmd == F_OFD_SETLK || cmd == F_OFD_SETLKW || cmd == F_OFD_GETLK ||
                                     ^
  trace/beauty/fcntl.c:93:58: error: ‘F_OFD_GETLK’ undeclared (first use in this function)
        cmd == F_OFD_SETLK || cmd == F_OFD_SETLKW || cmd == F_OFD_GETLK ||
                                                            ^
  mv: cannot stat ‘trace/beauty/.fcntl.o.tmp’: No such file or directory
  make[4]: *** [trace/beauty/fcntl.o] Error 1
  make[3]: *** [trace/beauty] Error 2
  make[3]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
    CC       tests/llvm.o

But we need to make sure that it is also in the tools/perf/MANIFEST file, that
is used to build a tarball for detached (from the kernel sources) compilation,
which was failing, with the above message, on a RHEL7.4 system, fix it.
