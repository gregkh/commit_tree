net: xfrm: revert to lower xfrm dst gc limit

revert c386578f1cdb4dac230395 ("xfrm: Let the flowcache handle its size by default.").

Once we remove flow cache, we don't have a flow cache limit anymore.
We must not allow (virtually) unlimited allocations of xfrm dst entries.
Revert back to the old xfrm dst gc limits.
