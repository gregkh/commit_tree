gcc-plugins: structleak: add option to init all vars used as byref args

In the Linux kernel, struct type variables are rarely passed by-value,
and so functions that initialize such variables typically take an input
reference to the variable rather than returning a value that can
subsequently be used in an assignment.

If the initalization function is not part of the same compilation unit,
the lack of an assignment operation defeats any analysis the compiler
can perform as to whether the variable may be used before having been
initialized. This means we may end up passing on such variables
uninitialized, resulting in potential information leaks.

So extend the existing structleak GCC plugin so it will [optionally]
apply to all struct type variables that have their address taken at any
point, rather than only to variables of struct types that have a __user
annotation.
