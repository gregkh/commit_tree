cpufreq: Replace "max_transition_latency" with "dynamic_switching"

There is no limitation in the ondemand or conservative governors which
disallow the transition_latency to be greater than 10 ms.

The max_transition_latency field is rather used to disallow automatic
dynamic frequency switching for platforms which didn't wanted these
governors to run.

Replace max_transition_latency with a boolean (dynamic_switching) and
check for transition_latency == CPUFREQ_ETERNAL along with that. This
makes it pretty straight forward to read/understand now.
