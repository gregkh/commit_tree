btrfs: Be explicit about usage of min()

__btrfs_alloc_chunk contains code which boils down to:

    ndevs = min(ndevs, devs_max)

It's conditional upon devs_max not being 0. However, it cannot really be 0
since it's always set to either BTRFS_MAX_DEVS_SYS_CHUNK or
BTRFS_MAX_DEVS(fs_info->chunk_root). So eliminate the condition check and use
min explicitly. This has no functional changes.
