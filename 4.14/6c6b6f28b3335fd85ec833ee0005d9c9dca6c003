loop: set physical block size to PAGE_SIZE

The physical block size is "the lowest possible sector size that the
hardware can operate on without reverting to read-modify-write
operations" (from the comment on blk_queue_physical_block_size()). Since
loop does buffered I/O on the backing file by default, the RMW unit is a
page. This isn't the case for direct I/O mode, but let's keep it simple.
