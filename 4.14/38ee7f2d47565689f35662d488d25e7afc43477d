ipv6: sr: add support for encapsulation of L2 frames

This patch implements the L2 frame encapsulation mechanism, referred to
as T.Encaps.L2 in the SRv6 specifications [1].

A new type of SRv6 tunnel mode is added (SEG6_IPTUN_MODE_L2ENCAP). It only
accepts packets with an existing MAC header (i.e., it will not work for
locally generated packets). The resulting packet looks like IPv6 -> SRH ->
Ethernet -> original L3 payload. The next header field of the SRH is set to
NEXTHDR_NONE.
