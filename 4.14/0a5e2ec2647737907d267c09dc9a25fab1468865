s390/kvm: fix detection of guest machine checks

The new detection code for guest machine checks added a check based
on %r11 to .Lcleanup_sie to distinguish between normal asynchronous
interrupts and machine checks. But the funtion is called from the
program check handler as well with an undefined value in %r11.

The effect is that all program exceptions pointing to the SIE instruction
will set the CIF_MCCK_GUEST bit. The bit stays set for the CPU until the
 next machine check comes in which will incorrectly be interpreted as a
guest machine check.

The simplest fix is to stop using .Lcleanup_sie in the program check
handler and duplicate a few instructions.
