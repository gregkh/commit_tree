power: supply: bq27xxx: Add chip IDs for previously shadowed chips

For the existing features, these chips act like others already ID'd,
so they had false but functional IDs. We will be adding features
which require correct IDs, so the following IDs are added:
BQ2752X, 531, 542, 546, 742, 425, 441, 621

Chip-specific features are now tracked by BQ27XXX_O_* flags in di->opts.

No functional changes to the driver.
