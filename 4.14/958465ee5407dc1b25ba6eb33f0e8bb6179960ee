powerpc: Add emulation for the addpcis instruction

The addpcis instruction puts the sum of the next instruction address
plus a constant into a register.  Since the result depends on the
address of the instruction, it will give an incorrect result if it
is single-stepped out of line, which is what the *probes subsystem
will currently do if a probe is placed on an addpcis instruction.
This fixes the problem by adding emulation of it to analyse_instr().
