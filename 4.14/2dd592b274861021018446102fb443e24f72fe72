net-next: tag_mtk: add flow_dissect callback to the ops struct

The MT7530 inserts the 4 magic header in between the 802.3 address and
protocol field. The patch implements the callback that can be called by
the flow dissector to figure out the real protocol and offset of the
network header. With this patch applied we can properly parse the packet
and thus make hashing function properly.
