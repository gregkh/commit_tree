powerpc/64s: Fix replay interrupt return label name

In __replay_interrupt() we take the address of a local label so we can
return to it later. However the assembler turns the local label into a
symbol with a name like ".L1^B42" - where "^B" is literally "\002".
This does not make for pleasant stack traces. Fix it by giving the
label a sensible name.
