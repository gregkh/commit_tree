liquidio: add missing strings in oct_dev_state_str array

There's supposed to be a one-to-one correspondence between the 18 macros
that #define the OCT_DEV states (in octeon_device.h) and the strings in the
oct_dev_state_str array, but there are only 14 strings in the array.

Add the missing strings (so they become 18 in total), and also revise some
incorrect/outdated text of existing strings.
