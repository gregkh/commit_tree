powerpc/mm: Rework mm_fault_error()

First, handle the normal retry failure in do_page_fault itself,
since it's a simple return statement. That allows us to remove
the "continue" special return code from mm_fault_error().

Once that's done, we can have an implementation much closer to
x86 where we only call mm_fault_error() if VM_FAULT_ERROR is set
and directly return.
