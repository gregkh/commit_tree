KVM: nVMX: update last_nonleaf_level when initializing nested EPT

The function updates context->root_level but didn't call
update_last_nonleaf_level so the previous and potentially wrong value
was used for page walks.  For example, a zero value of last_nonleaf_level
would allow a potential out-of-bounds access in arch/x86/mmu/paging_tmpl.h's
walk_addr_generic function (CVE-2017-12188).
