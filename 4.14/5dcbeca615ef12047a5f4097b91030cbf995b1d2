clk: samsung: exynos4: Enable VPLL and EPLL clocks for suspend/resume cycle

Commit 6edfa11cb396 ("clk: samsung: Add enable/disable operation for
PLL36XX clocks") added enable/disable operations to PLL clocks. Prior that
VPLL and EPPL clocks were always enabled because the enable bit was never
touched. Those clocks have to be enabled during suspend/resume cycle,
because otherwise board fails to enter sleep mode. This patch enables them
unconditionally before entering system suspend state. System restore
function will set them to the previous state saved in the register cache
done before that unconditional enable.
