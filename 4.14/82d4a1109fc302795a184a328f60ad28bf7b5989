perf trace: Group per syscall arg formatter info into one struct

Instead of having syscall_fmt.{arg_scnprintf,arg_parm}, introduce
struct syscall_arg_fmt and have these two, paving the way for more
state to change the formatting algorithms.

For instance, in the 'fcntl' 'cmd' case it is better not to suppress
it when being zero, showing instead its name "DUPFD".

We had that in an ad-hoc way just for strarrays, but with more involved
cases like fcntl, that can't be done with just a strarray, we'll need
a ".show_zero" arg in the 'cmd' syscall_arg_fmt.
