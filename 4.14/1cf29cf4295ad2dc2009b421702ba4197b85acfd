binder: remove binder_debug_no_lock mechanism

With the global lock, there was a mechanism to access
binder driver debugging information with the global
lock disabled to debug deadlocks or other issues.
This mechanism is rarely (if ever) used anymore
and wasn't needed during the development of
fine-grained locking in the binder driver.
Removing it.
