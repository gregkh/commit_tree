quota: Protect dquot writeout with dq_lock

Currently dquot writeout is only protected by dqio_sem held for writing.
As we transition to a finer grained locking we will use dquot->dq_lock
instead. So acquire it in dquot_commit() and move dqio_sem just around
->commit_dqblk() call as it is still needed to serialize quota file
changes.
