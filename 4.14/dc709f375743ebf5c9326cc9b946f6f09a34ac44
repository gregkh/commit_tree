rtnetlink: bring NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER event process back in rtnetlink_event

libteam needs this event notification in userspace when dev's master
dev has been changed. After this, the redundant notifications issue
would be fixed in the later patch 'rtnetlink: check DO_SETLINK_NOTIFY
correctly in do_setlink'.
