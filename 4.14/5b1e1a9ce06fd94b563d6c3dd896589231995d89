bnxt_en: Fix possible corruption in DCB parameters from firmware.

hwrm_send_message() is replaced with _hwrm_send_message(), and
hwrm_cmd_lock mutex lock is grabbed for the whole period of
firmware call until the firmware DCB parameters have been copied.
This will prevent possible corruption of the firmware data.
