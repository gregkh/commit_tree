watchdog/core: Get rid of the thread teardown/setup dance

The lockup detector reconfiguration tears down all watchdog threads when
the watchdog is disabled and sets them up again when its enabled.

That's a pointless exercise. The watchdog threads are not consuming an
insane amount of resources, so it's enough to set them up at init time and
keep them in parked position when the watchdog is disabled and unpark them
when it is reenabled. The smpboot thread infrastructure takes care of
keeping the force parked threads in place even across cpu hotplug.

Aside of that the code implements the park/unpark facility of smp hotplug
threads on its own, which is even more pointless. We have functionality in
the smpboot thread code to do so.

Use the new thread management functions and get rid of the unholy mess.
