dt-bindings: leds: gpio: Add optional retain-state-shutdown property

On Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) systems it's sometimes
necessary for a LED to retain its state across a BMC reset (which is
independent of the host system state). Add a devicetree property to
describe this behaviour. The property would typically be used in
conjunction with 'default-state = "keep"'.
