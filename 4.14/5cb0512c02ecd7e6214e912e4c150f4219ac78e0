Kbuild: don't pass "-C" to preprocessor when processing linker scripts

For some odd historical reason, we preprocessed the linker scripts with
"-C", which keeps comments around.  That makes no sense, since the
comments are not meaningful for the build anyway.

And it actually breaks things, since linker scripts can't have C++ style
"//" comments in them, so keeping comments after preprocessing now
limits us in odd and surprising ways in our header files for no good
reason.

The -C option goes back to pre-git and pre-bitkeeper times, but seems to
have been historically used (along with "-traditional") for some
odd-ball architectures (ia64, MIPS and SH).  It probably didn't matter
back then either, but might possibly have been used to minimize the
difference between the original file and the pre-processed result.

The reason for this may be lost in time, but let's not perpetuate it
only because we can't remember why we did this crazy thing.

This was triggered by the recent addition of SPDX lines to the source
tree, where people apparently were confused about why header files
couldn't use the C++ comment format.
