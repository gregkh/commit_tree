treewide: make "nr_cpu_ids" unsigned

First, number of CPUs can't be negative number.

Second, different signnnedness leads to suboptimal code in the following
cases:

1)
	kmalloc(nr_cpu_ids * sizeof(X));

"int" has to be sign extended to size_t.

2)
	while (loff_t *pos < nr_cpu_ids)

MOVSXD is 1 byte longed than the same MOV.

Other cases exist as well. Basically compiler is told that nr_cpu_ids
can't be negative which can't be deduced if it is "int".
