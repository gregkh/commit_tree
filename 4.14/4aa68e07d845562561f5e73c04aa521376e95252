KEYS: restrict /proc/keys by credentials at open time

When checking for permission to view keys whilst reading from
/proc/keys, we should use the credentials with which the /proc/keys file
was opened.  This is because, in a classic type of exploit, it can be
possible to bypass checks for the *current* credentials by passing the
file descriptor to a suid program.

Following commit 34dbbcdbf633 ("Make file credentials available to the
seqfile interfaces") we can finally fix it.  So let's do it.
