ipv6: fix false-postive maybe-uninitialized warning

Adding a lock around one of the assignments prevents gcc from
tracking the state of the local 'fibmatch' variable, so it can no
longer prove that 'dst' is always initialized, leading to a bogus
warning:

net/ipv6/route.c: In function 'inet6_rtm_getroute':
net/ipv6/route.c:3659:2: error: 'dst' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This moves the other assignment into the same lock to shut up the
warning.
