iommu/amd: Do not disable SWIOTLB if SME is active

When SME memory encryption is active it will rely on SWIOTLB to handle
DMA for devices that cannot support the addressing requirements of
having the encryption mask set in the physical address.  The IOMMU
currently disables SWIOTLB if it is not running in passthrough mode.
This is not desired as non-PCI devices attempting DMA may fail. Update
the code to check if SME is active and not disable SWIOTLB.
