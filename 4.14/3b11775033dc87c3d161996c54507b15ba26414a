tcp: do not mangle skb->cb[] in tcp_make_synack()

Christoph Paasch sent a patch to address the following issue :

tcp_make_synack() is leaving some TCP private info in skb->cb[],
then send the packet by other means than tcp_transmit_skb()

tcp_transmit_skb() makes sure to clear skb->cb[] to not confuse
IPv4/IPV6 stacks, but we have no such cleanup for SYNACK.

tcp_make_synack() should not use tcp_init_nondata_skb() :

tcp_init_nondata_skb() really should be limited to skbs put in write/rtx
queues (the ones that are only sent via tcp_transmit_skb())

This patch fixes the issue and should even save few cpu cycles ;)
