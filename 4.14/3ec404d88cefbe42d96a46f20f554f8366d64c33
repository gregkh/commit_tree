MIPS: math-emu: RINT.<D|S>: Fix several problems by reimplementation

Reimplement RINT.<D|S> kernel emulation so that all RINT.<D|S>
specifications are met.

For the sake of simplicity, let's analyze RINT.S only. Prior to
this patch, RINT.S emulation was essentially implemented as (in
pseudocode) <output> = ieee754sp_flong(ieee754sp_tlong(<input>)),
where ieee754sp_tlong() and ieee754sp_flong() are functions
providing conversion from double to integer, and from integer
to double, respectively. On surface, this implementation looks
correct, but actually fails in many cases. Following problems
were detected:

1. NaN and infinity cases will not be handled properly. The
   function ieee754sp_flong() never returns NaN nor infinity.
2. For RINT.S, for all inputs larger than LONG_MAX, and smaller
   than FLT_MAX, the result will be wrong, and the overflow
   exception will be erroneously set. A similar problem for
   negative inputs exists as well.
3. For some rounding modes, for some negative inputs close to zero,
   the return value will be zero, and should be -zero. This is
   because ieee754sp_flong() never returns -zero.

This patch removes the problems above by implementing dedicated
functions for RINT.<D|S> emulation.

The core of the new function functionality is adapted version of
the core of the function ieee754sp_tlong(). However, there are many
details that are implemented to match RINT.<D|S> specification. It
should be said that the functionality of ieee754sp_tlong() actually
closely corresponds to CVT.L.S instruction, and it is used while
emulating CVT.L.S. However, RINT.S and CVT.L.S instructions differ
in many aspects. This patch fulfills missing support for RINT.<D|S>.
