KEYS: fix cred refcount leak in request_key_auth_new()

In request_key_auth_new(), if key_alloc() or key_instantiate_and_link()
were to fail, we would leak a reference to the 'struct cred'.  Currently
this can only happen if key_alloc() fails to allocate memory.  But it
still should be fixed, as it is a more severe bug waiting to happen.

Fix it by cleaning things up to use a helper function which frees a
'struct request_key_auth' correctly.
