xdp: remove net_device names from xdp_redirect tracepoint

There is too much overhead in the current trace_xdp_redirect
tracepoint as it does strcpy and strlen on the net_device names.

Besides, exposing the ifindex/index is actually the information that
is needed in the tracepoint to diagnose issues.  When a lookup fails
(either ifindex or devmap index) then there is a need for saying which
to_index that have issues.

V2: Adjust args to be aligned with trace_xdp_exception.
