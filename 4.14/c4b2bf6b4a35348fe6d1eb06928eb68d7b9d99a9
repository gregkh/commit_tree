openvswitch: Optimize operations for OvS flow_stats.

When calling the flow_free() to free the flow, we call many times
(cpu_possible_mask, eg. 128 as default) cpumask_next(). That will
take up our CPU usage if we call the flow_free() frequently.
When we put all packets to userspace via upcall, and OvS will send
them back via netlink to ovs_packet_cmd_execute(will call flow_free).

The test topo is shown as below. VM01 sends TCP packets to VM02,
and OvS forward packtets. When testing, we use perf to report the
system performance.

VM01 --- OvS-VM --- VM02

Without this patch, perf-top show as below: The flow_free() is
3.02% CPU usage.

	4.23%  [kernel]            [k] _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore
	3.62%  [kernel]            [k] __do_softirq
	3.16%  [kernel]            [k] __memcpy
	3.02%  [kernel]            [k] flow_free
	2.42%  libc-2.17.so        [.] __memcpy_ssse3_back
	2.18%  [kernel]            [k] copy_user_generic_unrolled
	2.17%  [kernel]            [k] find_next_bit

When applied this patch, perf-top show as below: Not shown on
the list anymore.

	4.11%  [kernel]            [k] _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore
	3.79%  [kernel]            [k] __do_softirq
	3.46%  [kernel]            [k] __memcpy
	2.73%  libc-2.17.so        [.] __memcpy_ssse3_back
	2.25%  [kernel]            [k] copy_user_generic_unrolled
	1.89%  libc-2.17.so        [.] _int_malloc
	1.53%  ovs-vswitchd        [.] xlate_actions

With this patch, the TCP throughput(we dont use Megaflow Cache
+ Microflow Cache) between VMs is 1.18Gbs/sec up to 1.30Gbs/sec
(maybe ~10% performance imporve).

This patch adds cpumask struct, the cpu_used_mask stores the cpu_id
that the flow used. And we only check the flow_stats on the cpu we
used, and it is unncessary to check all possible cpu when getting,
cleaning, and updating the flow_stats. Adding the cpu_used_mask to
sw_flow struct doesâ€™t increase the cacheline number.
