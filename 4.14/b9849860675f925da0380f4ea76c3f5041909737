net: stmmac: dwmac_lib: fix interchanged sleep/timeout values in DMA reset function

The DMA reset timeout, used in read_poll_timeout, is
ten times shorter than the sleep time.
This patch fixes these values interchanging them, as it was
before the read_poll_timeout introduction.

Fixes: 8a70aeca80c2 ("net: stmmac: Use readl_poll_timeout")
