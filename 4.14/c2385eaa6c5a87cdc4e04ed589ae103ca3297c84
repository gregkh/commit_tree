KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: Check GITS_BASER Valid bit before saving tables

At the moment we don't properly check the GITS_BASER<n>.Valid
bit before saving the collection and device tables.

On vgic_its_save_collection_table() we use the GITS_BASER gpa
field whereas the Valid bit should be used.

On vgic_its_save_device_tables() there is no check. This can
cause various bugs, among which a subsequent fault when accessing
the table in guest memory.

Let's systematically check the Valid bit before doing anything.

We also uniformize the code between save and restore.
