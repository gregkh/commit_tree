rcu: Make NOCB CPUs migrate CBs directly from outgoing CPU

RCU's CPU-hotplug callback-migration code first moves the outgoing
CPU's callbacks to ->orphan_done and ->orphan_pend, and only then
moves them to the NOCB callback list.  This commit avoids the
extra step (and simplifies the code) by moving the callbacks directly
from the outgoing CPU's callback list to the NOCB callback list.
