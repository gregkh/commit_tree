zram: clean up duplicated codes in __zram_bvec_write

Patch series "writeback incompressible pages to storage", v1.

zRam is useful for memory saving with compressible pages but sometime,
workload can be changed and system has lots of incompressible pages
which is very harmful for zram.

This patch supports writeback feature of zram so admin can set up a
block device and with it, zram can save the memory via writing out the
incompressile pages once it found it's incompressible pages (1/4 comp
ratio) instead of keeping the page in memory.

[1-3] is just clean up and [4-8] is step by step feature enablement.
[4-8] is logically not bisectable(ie, logical unit separation)
although I tried to compiled out without breaking but I think it would
be better to review.

This patch (of 9):

__zram_bvec_write has some of duplicated logic for zram meta data
handling of same_page|compressed_page.  This patch aims to clean it up
without behavior change.
