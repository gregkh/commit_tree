tools headers: Sync cpu features kernel ABI headers with tooling headers

These changes made the tools/arch/x86/include/ headers to drift from its
kernel origins:

  910448bbed06 ("perf/x86/amd/uncore: Rename cpufeatures macro for cache counters")
  5442c2699552 ("x86/cpufeature, kvm/svm: Rename (shorten) the new "virtualized VMSAVE/VMLOAD" CPUID flag")
  cba4671af755 ("x86/mm: Disable PCID on 32-bit kernels")

Which was detected while building perf:

  make: Entering directory '/home/acme/git/linux/tools/perf'
    BUILD:   Doing 'make -j4' parallel build
  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h'
  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h'

This sync causes just these perf object files to be rebuilt:

  CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/mem-memcpy-x86-64-asm.o
  CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/mem-memset-x86-64-asm.o

And the changes in the above changesets don't entail any need for change
in the above 'perf bench' files.
