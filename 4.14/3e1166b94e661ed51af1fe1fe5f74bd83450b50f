crypto: inside-secure - fix gcc-4.9 warnings

All older compiler versions up to gcc-4.9 produce these
harmless warnings:

drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel_cipher.c:389:9: warning: missing braces around initializer [-Wmissing-braces]
drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel_cipher.c:389:9: warning: (near initialization for ‘result.completion’) [-Wmissing-braces]
drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel_hash.c:422:9: warning: missing braces around initializer [-Wmissing-braces]
drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel_hash.c:422:9: warning: (near initialization for ‘result.completion’) [-Wmissing-braces]

This changes the syntax to something that works on all versions
without warnings.
