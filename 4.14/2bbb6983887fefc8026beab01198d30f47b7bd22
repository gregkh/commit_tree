hwrng: use rng source with best quality

This patch rewoks the hwrng to always use the
rng source with best entropy quality.

On registation and unregistration the hwrng now
tries to choose the best (= highest quality value)
rng source. The handling of the internal list
of registered rng sources is now always sorted
by quality and the top most rng chosen.
