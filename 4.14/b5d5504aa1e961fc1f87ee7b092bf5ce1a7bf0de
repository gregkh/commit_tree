i40e: prevent snprintf format specifier truncation

Increase the size of the prefix buffer so that it can hold enough
characters for every possible input. Although 20 is enough for all
expected inputs, it is possible for the values to be larger than
expected, resulting in a possibly truncated string. Additionally, lets
use sizeof(prefix) in order to ensure we use the correct size if we need
to change the array length in the future.

New versions of GCC starting at 7 now include warnings to prevent
truncation unless you handle the return code. At most 27 bytes can be
written here, so lets just increase the buffer size even if for all
expected hw->bus.* values we only needed 20.
