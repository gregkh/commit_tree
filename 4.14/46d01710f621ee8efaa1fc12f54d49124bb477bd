tty: serial: jsm: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   2442	   1088	      8	   3538	    dd2	tty/serial/jsm/jsm_driver.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   3082	    448	      8	   3538	    dd2 tty/serial/jsm/jsm_driver.o
