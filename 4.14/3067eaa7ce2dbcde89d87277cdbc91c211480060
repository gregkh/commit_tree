perf test: Add test cases for new data source encoding

Add some simple tests to perf test to test data source printing.

v2: Make the tests actually checked for the correct name of Forward
v3: Adjust to new encoding

Committer notes:

Avoid the in place declaration to make this build with older compilers,
for instance, in Debian 7 we get:

  tests/mem.c: In function 'test__mem':
  tests/mem.c:30:5: error: missing initializer [-Werror=missing-field-initializers]
  tests/mem.c:30:5: error: (near initialization for '(anonymous).<anonymous>.mem_snoop') [-Werror=missing-field-initializers]

So just zero a struct, then go on building the unions as needed,
reusing settings from the previous test, i.e. local -> remote, etc.
