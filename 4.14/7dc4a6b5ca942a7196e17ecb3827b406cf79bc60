mwifiex: pcie: don't allow cmd buffer reuse after reset

In rogue cases (due to other bugs) it's possible we try to process an
old command response *after* resetting the device. This could trigger a
double-free (or the SKB can get reallocated elsewhere...causing other
memory corruptions) in mwifiex_pcie_process_cmd_complete().

For safety (and symmetry) let's always NULL out the command buffer as we
free it up. We're already doing this for the command response buffer.
