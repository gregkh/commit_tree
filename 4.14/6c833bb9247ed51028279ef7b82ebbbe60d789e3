arm64: perf: Allow standard PMUv3 events to be extended by the CPU type

Rather than continue adding CPU-specific event maps, instead look up by
default in the PMUv3 event map and only fallback to the CPU-specific maps
if either the event isn't described by PMUv3, or it is described but
the PMCEID registers say that it is unsupported by the current CPU.
