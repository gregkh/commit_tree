kbuild: Fix optimization level choice default

The choice containing the CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE symbol
accidentally added a "CONFIG_" prefix when trying to make it the
default, selecting an undefined symbol as the default.

The mistake is harmless here: Since the default symbol is not visible,
the choice falls back on using the visible symbol as the default
instead, which is CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE, as intended.

A patch that makes Kconfig print a warning in this case has been
submitted separately:
