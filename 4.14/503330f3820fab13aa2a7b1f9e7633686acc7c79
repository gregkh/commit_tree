quota: Remove dq_wait_unused from dquot

Currently every dquot carries a wait_queue_head_t used only when we are
turning quotas off to wait for last users to drop dquot references.
Since such rare case is not performance sensitive in any means, just use
a global waitqueue for this and save space in struct dquot. Also convert
the logic to use wait_event() instead of open-coding it.
