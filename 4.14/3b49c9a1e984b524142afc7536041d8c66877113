fs: convert a pile of fsync routines to errseq_t based reporting

This patch converts most of the in-kernel filesystems that do writeback
out of the pagecache to report errors using the errseq_t-based
infrastructure that was recently added. This allows them to report
errors once for each open file description.

Most filesystems have a fairly straightforward fsync operation. They
call filemap_write_and_wait_range to write back all of the data and
wait on it, and then (sometimes) sync out the metadata.

For those filesystems this is a straightforward conversion from calling
filemap_write_and_wait_range in their fsync operation to calling
file_write_and_wait_range.
