char/mwave: make some arrays static const to make object code smaller

Don't populate arrays on the stack but make them static.  Makes
the object code smaller.  Also remove temporary variables that
have hard coded array sizes and just use ARRAY_SIZE instead and
wrap some lines that are wider than 80 chars to clean up some
checkpatch warnings.
