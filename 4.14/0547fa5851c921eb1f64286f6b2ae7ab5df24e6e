checkpatch: add 6 missing types to --list-types

Unlike all other types, LONG_LINE, LONG_LINE_COMMENT and LONG_LINE_STRING
are passed to WARN() through a variable.  This causes the parser in
list_types() to miss them and consequently they are not present in the
output of --list-types.

Additionally, types TYPO_SPELLING, FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS and AVOID_BUG are
passed with a variable level, causing the parser to miss them too.

So modify the regex to also catch these special cases.
