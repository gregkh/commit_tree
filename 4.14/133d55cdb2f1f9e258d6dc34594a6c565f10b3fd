block: order /proc/devices by major number

Presently, the order of the block devices listed in /proc/devices is not
entirely sequential. If a block device has a major number greater than
BLKDEV_MAJOR_HASH_SIZE (255), it will be ordered as if its major were
module 255. For example, 511 appears after 1.

This patch cleans that up and prints each major number in the correct
order, regardless of where they are stored in the hash table.

In order to do this, we introduce BLKDEV_MAJOR_MAX as an artificial
limit (chosen to be 512). It will then print all devices in major
order number from 0 to the maximum.
