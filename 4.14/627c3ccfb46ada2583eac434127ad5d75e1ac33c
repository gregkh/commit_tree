mmc: debugfs: Move block debugfs into block module

If we don't have the block layer enabled, we do not present card
status and extcsd in the debugfs.

Debugfs is not ABI, and maintaining files of no relevance for
non-block devices comes at a high maintenance cost if we shall
support it with the block layer compiled out.

The debugfs entries suffer from all the same starvation
issues as the other userspace things, under e.g. a heavy
dd operation.

The expected number of debugfs users utilizing these two
debugfs files is already low as there is an ioctl() to get the
same information using the mmc-tools, and of these few users
the expected number of people using it on SDIO or combo cards
are expected to be zero.

It is therefore logical to move this over to the block layer
when it is enabled, using the new custom requests and issue
it using the block request queue.

On the other hand it moves some debugfs code from debugfs.c
and into block.c.

Tested during heavy dd load by cat:in the status file.
