watchdog/core: Remove broken suspend/resume interfaces

This interface has several issues:

 - It's causing recursive locking of the hotplug lock.

 - It's complete overkill to teardown all threads and then recreate them

The same can be achieved with the simple hardlockup_detector_perf_stop /
restart() interfaces. The abuse from the busy looping poweroff() loop of
PARISC has been solved as well.

Remove the cruft.
