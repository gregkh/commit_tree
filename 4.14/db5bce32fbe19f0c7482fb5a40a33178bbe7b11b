net: prepare (struct ubuf_info)->refcnt conversion

In order to convert this atomic_t refcnt to refcount_t,
we need to init the refcount to one to not trigger
a 0 -> 1 transition.

This also removes one atomic operation in fast path.

v2: removed dead code in sock_zerocopy_put_abort()
as suggested by Willem.
