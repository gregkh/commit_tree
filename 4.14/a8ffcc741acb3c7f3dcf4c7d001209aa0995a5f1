net/mlx5: Increase the maximum flow counters supported

Read new NIC capability field which represnts 16 MSBs of the max flow
counters number supported (max_flow_counter_31_16).

Backward compatibility with older firmware is preserved, the modified
driver reads max_flow_counter_31_16 as 0 from the older firmware and
uses up to 64K counters.

Changed flow counter id from 16 bits to 32 bits. Backward compatibility
with older firmware is preserved as we kept the 16 LSBs of the counter
id in place and added 16 MSBs from reserved field.

Changed the background bulk reading of flow counters to work in chunks
of at most 32K counters, to make sure we don't attempt to allocate very
large buffers.
