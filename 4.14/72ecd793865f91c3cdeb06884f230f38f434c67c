ARM: ux500: Fix regression while init PM domains

The commit afece3ab9a36 ("PM / Domains: Add time accounting to various
genpd states") causes a boot regression for ux500.

The problem occurs when the ux500 machine code calls pm_genpd_init(), which
since the above change triggers a call to ktime_get(). More precisely,
because ux500 initializes PM domains in the init_IRQ() phase of the boot,
timekeeping has not yet been initialized.

Fix the problem by moving the initialization of the PM domains to after
timekeeping has been initialized.
