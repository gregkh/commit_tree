ASoC: rsnd: remove 16ch support for now

R-Car Gen3 sound device can use TDM 16ch, but its usage is very
limited. It is not yet supported.
Let's remove unexpected/unsupported channel settings for now.
This patch makes xx_ADINR register settings sanity without
runtime check.

40.4.7 Note on Usage of the SSIU Module

only the transfer with the external memory is available.
