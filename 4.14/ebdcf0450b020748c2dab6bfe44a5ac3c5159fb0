rtnetlink: bring NETDEV_CHANGE_TX_QUEUE_LEN event process back in rtnetlink_event

The same fix for changing mtu in the patch 'rtnetlink: bring
NETDEV_CHANGEMTU event process back in rtnetlink_event' is
needed for changing tx_queue_len.

Note that the redundant notifications issue for tx_queue_len
will be fixed in the later patch 'rtnetlink: do not send
notification for tx_queue_len in do_setlink'.
