IB/hfi1: Turn off AOC TX after offline substates

Offline.quietDuration was added in the 8051 firmware, and the driver
only turns off the AOC transmitters when offline.quiet is reached.
However, the AOC transmitters need to be turned off at the new state.
Therefore, turn off the AOC transmitters at any offline substates
including offline.quiet and offline.quietDuration, then recheck we
reached offline.quiet to support backwards compatibility.
