mm/migrate: new memory migration helper for use with device memory

This patch add a new memory migration helpers, which migrate memory
backing a range of virtual address of a process to different memory (which
can be allocated through special allocator).  It differs from numa
migration by working on a range of virtual address and thus by doing
migration in chunk that can be large enough to use DMA engine or special
copy offloading engine.

Expected users are any one with heterogeneous memory where different
memory have different characteristics (latency, bandwidth, ...).  As an
example IBM platform with CAPI bus can make use of this feature to migrate
between regular memory and CAPI device memory.  New CPU architecture with
a pool of high performance memory not manage as cache but presented as
regular memory (while being faster and with lower latency than DDR) will
also be prime user of this patch.

Migration to private device memory will be useful for device that have
large pool of such like GPU, NVidia plans to use HMM for that.
