mm/memory_hotplug: introduce add_pages

There are new users of memory hotplug emerging.  Some of them require
different subset of arch_add_memory.  There are some which only require
allocation of struct pages without mapping those pages to the kernel
address space.  We currently have __add_pages for that purpose.  But this
is rather lowlevel and not very suitable for the code outside of the
memory hotplug.  E.g.  x86_64 wants to update max_pfn which should be done
by the caller.  Introduce add_pages() which should care about those
details if they are needed.  Each architecture should define its
implementation and select CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_ADD_PAGES.  All others use the
currently existing __add_pages.
