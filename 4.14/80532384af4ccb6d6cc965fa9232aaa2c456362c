net: sched: fix memleak for chain zero

There's a memleak happening for chain 0. The thing is, chain 0 needs to
be always present, not created on demand. Therefore tcf_block_get upon
creation of block calls the tcf_chain_create function directly. The
chain is created with refcnt == 1, which is not correct in this case and
causes the memleak. So move the refcnt increment into tcf_chain_get
function even for the case when chain needs to be created.
