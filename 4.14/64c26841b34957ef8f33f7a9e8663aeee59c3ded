arm64: Ignore hardware dirty bit updates in ptep_set_wrprotect()

ptep_set_wrprotect() is only called on CoW mappings which are private
(!VM_SHARED) with the pte either read-only (!PTE_WRITE && PTE_RDONLY) or
writable and software-dirty (PTE_WRITE && !PTE_RDONLY && PTE_DIRTY).
There is no race with the hardware update of the dirty state: clearing
of PTE_RDONLY when PTE_WRITE (a.k.a. PTE_DBM) is set. This patch removes
the code setting the software PTE_DIRTY bit in ptep_set_wrprotect() as
superfluous. A VM_WARN_ONCE is introduced in case the above logic is
wrong or the core mm code changes its use of ptep_set_wrprotect().
