kvm/x86: Avoid clearing the C-bit in rsvd_bits()

The following commit:

  d0ec49d4de90 ("kvm/x86/svm: Support Secure Memory Encryption within KVM")

uses __sme_clr() to remove the C-bit in rsvd_bits(). rsvd_bits() is
just a simple function to return some 1 bits. Applying a mask based
on properties of the host MMU is incorrect. Additionally, the masks
computed by __reset_rsvds_bits_mask also apply to guest page tables,
where the C bit is reserved since we don't emulate SME.

The fix is to clear the C-bit from rsvd_bits_mask array after it has been
populated from __reset_rsvds_bits_mask()
