kmod: split out umh code into its own file

Patch series "kmod: few code cleanups to split out umh code"

The usermode helper has a provenance from the old usb code which first
required a usermode helper.  Eventually this was shoved into kmod.c and
the kernel's modprobe calls was converted over eventually to share the
same code.  Over time the list of usermode helpers in the kernel has grown
-- so kmod is just but one user of the API.

This series is a simple logical cleanup which acknowledges the code
evolution of the usermode helper and shoves the UMH API into its own
dedicated file.  This way users of the API can later just include umh.h
instead of kmod.h.

Note despite the diff state the first patch really is just a code shove,
no functional changes are done there.  I did use git format-patch -M to
generate the patch, but in the end the split was not enough for git to
consider it a rename hence the large diffstat.

I've put this through 0-day and it gives me their machine compilation
blessings with all tests as OK.

This patch (of 4):

There's a slew of usermode helper users and kmod is just one of them.
Split out the usermode helper code into its own file to keep the logic and
focus split up.

This change provides no functional changes.
