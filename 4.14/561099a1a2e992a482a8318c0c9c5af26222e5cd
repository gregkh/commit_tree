leds: pca955x: add GPIO support

The PCA955x family of chips are I2C LED blinkers whose pins not used
to control LEDs can be used as general purpose I/Os (GPIOs).

The following adds such a support by defining different operation
modes for the pins (See bindings documentation for more details). The
pca955x driver is then extended with a gpio_chip when some of pins are
operating as GPIOs. The default operating mode is to behave as a LED.

The GPIO support is conditioned by CONFIG_LEDS_PCA955X_GPIO.
