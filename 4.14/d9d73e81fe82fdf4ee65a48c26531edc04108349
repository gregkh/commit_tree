sh: sh7269: remove nonexistent GPIO_PH[0-7] to fix pinctrl registration

Pinmux_pins[] is initialized through PINMUX_GPIO(), using designated
array initializers, where the GPIO_* enums serve as indices.  If enum
values are defined, but never used, pinmux_pins[] contains (zero-filled)
holes.  Such entries are treated as pin zero, which was registered
before, thus leading to pinctrl registration failures, as seen on
sh7722:

    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: pin 0 already registered
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: error during pin registration
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: could not register: -22
    sh-pfc: probe of pfc-sh7722 failed with error -22

Remove GPIO_PH[0-7] from the enum to fix this.
