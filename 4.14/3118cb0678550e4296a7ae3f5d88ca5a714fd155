drm/i915: Drop unpin stall in atomic_prepare_commit

The core already does this in setup_commit(). With this we can also
remove the unpin_work_count since it's the last user, and also remove
the loop since that was only used for stalling against legacy flips.

v2: Amend commit message a bit (Chris).
