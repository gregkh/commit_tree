xfs: Capture state of the right inode in xfs_iflush_done

My previous patch: d3a304b6292168b83b45d624784f973fdc1ca674 check for
XFS_LI_FAILED flag xfs_iflush done, so the failed item can be properly
resubmitted.

In the loop scanning other inodes being completed, it should check the
current item for the XFS_LI_FAILED, and not the initial one.

The state of the initial inode is checked after the loop ends

Kudos to Eric for catching this.
