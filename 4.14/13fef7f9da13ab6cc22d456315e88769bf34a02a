powerpc/47x: Guard 47x cputable entries with CONFIG_PPC_47x

Currently we build the 47x cputable entries even when CONFIG_PPC_47x is
disabled. That means a kernel built without CONFIG_PPC_47x will claim to
support a 47x CPU and start booting, only to break somewhere later
because it doesn't have 47x support compiled in.

So guard the 47x cputable entries with CONFIG_PPC_47x. Note that this is
inside the #ifdef CONFIG_44x section, because 47x depends on 44x.
