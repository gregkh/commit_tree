staging: lustre: ptlrpc: correct use of list_add_tail()

With people starting to test security enabled ptlrpc
a list_del corruption was reported. The reason for
this error was tracked down to wrong arguments to
list_add_tail(). In sptlrpc_gc_add_sec() swap the
arguments to list_add_tail() so that it does what
we meant it to do.
