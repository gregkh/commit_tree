ARM: OMAP2+: Add pdata-quirks for MMC/SD on DRA74x EVM

DRA74x EVM Rev H EVM comes with revision 2.0 silicon.
However, earlier versions of EVM can come with either
revision 1.1 or revision 1.0 of silicon.

The device-tree file is written to support rev 2.0 of
silicon. pdata quirks are used to then override the
settings needed for PG 1.1 silicon.

PG 1.1 silicon has limitations w.r.t frequencies at
which MMC1/2/3 can operate as well as different IOdelay
numbers.
