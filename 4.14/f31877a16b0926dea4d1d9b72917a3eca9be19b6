ASoC: cs43130: Fix possible Oops with invalid dev_id

As compiler spotted out, there is the potential NULL-dereference in
the code when dc-measure OF is given for other than 43130/43131:
  sound/soc/codecs/cs43130.c:2089:18: warning: ‘hpload_seq’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Warn it and return before triggering Oops.
