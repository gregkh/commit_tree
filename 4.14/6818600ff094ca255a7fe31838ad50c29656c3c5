mm,compaction: serialize waitqueue_active() checks (for real)

Andrea brought to my attention that the L->{L,S} guarantees are
completely bogus for this case.  I was looking at the diagram, from the
offending commit, when that _is_ the race, we had the load reordered
already.

What we need is at least S->L semantics, thus simply use
wq_has_sleeper() to serialize the call for good.
