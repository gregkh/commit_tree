media: cec: Respond to unregistered initiators, when applicable

Running CEC 1.4 compliance test we get the following error on test
11.1.6.2: "ERROR: The DUT did not broadcast a
<Report Physical Address> message to the unregistered device."

Fix this by letting GIVE_PHYSICAL_ADDR message respond to unregistered
device. Also, GIVE_DEVICE_VENDOR_ID and GIVE_FEATURES fall in the
same category so, respond also to these messages.

With this fix we pass CEC 1.4 official compliance.
