PCI/IB: add support for pci driver attribute groups

Some drivers (specifically the nes IB driver), want to create a lot of
sysfs driver attributes.  Instead of open-coding the creation and
removal of these files (and getting it wrong btw), it's a better idea to
let the driver core handle all of this logic for us.

So add a new field to the pci driver structure, **groups, that allows
pci drivers to specify an attribute group list it wishes to have created
when it is registered with the driver core.

Big bonus is now the driver doesn't race with userspace when the sysfs
files are created vs. when the kobject is announced, so any script/tool
that actually wanted to use these files will not have to poll waiting
for them to show up.
