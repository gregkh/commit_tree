mm, swap: fix swap readahead marking

In the original implementation, it is possible that the existing pages
in the swap cache (not newly readahead) could be marked as the readahead
pages.  This will cause the statistics of swap readahead be wrong and
influence the swap readahead algorithm too.

This is fixed via marking a page as the readahead page only if it is
newly allocated and read from the disk.

When testing with linpack, after the fixing the swap readahead hit rate
increased from ~66% to ~86%.
