arm64: hugetlb: Spring clean huge pte accessors

This patch aims to re-structure the huge pte accessors without affecting
their functionality. Control flow is changed to reduce indentation and
expanded use is made of post for loop variable modification.

It is then much easier to add break-before-make semantics in a subsequent
patch.
