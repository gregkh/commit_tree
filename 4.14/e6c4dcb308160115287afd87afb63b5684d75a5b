powerpc/kprobes: Dereference function pointers only if the address does not belong to kernel text

This makes the changes introduced in commit 83e840c770f2c5
("powerpc64/elfv1: Only dereference function descriptor for non-text
symbols") to be specific to the kprobe subsystem.

We previously changed ppc_function_entry() to always check the provided
address to confirm if it needed to be dereferenced. This is actually
only an issue for kprobe blacklisted asm labels (through use of
_ASM_NOKPROBE_SYMBOL) and can cause other issues with ftrace. Also, the
additional checks are not really necessary for our other uses.

As such, move this check to the kprobes subsystem.
