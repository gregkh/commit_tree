usb:xhci:Fix regression when ATI chipsets detected

The following commit cause a regression on ATI chipsets.
'commit e788787ef4f9 ("usb:xhci:Add quirk for Certain
failing HP keyboard on reset after resume")'

This causes pinfo->smbus_dev to be wrongly set to NULL on
systems with the ATI chipset that this function checks for first.

Added conditional check for AMD chipsets to avoid the overwriting
pinfo->smbus_dev.
