mlxsw: spectrum_router: Extract mlxsw_sp_rt6_is_gateway()

IPv6 counterpart of the previous patch: introduce a function to
determine whether a given route is a gateway route.

The new function takes a mlxsw_sp argument which follow-up patches will
use. Thus mlxsw_sp_fib6_entry_type_set() got that argument as well.
