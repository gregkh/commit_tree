mm, page_owner: make init_pages_in_zone() faster

In init_pages_in_zone() we currently use the generic set_page_owner()
function to initialize page_owner info for early allocated pages.  This
means we needlessly do lookup_page_ext() twice for each page, and more
importantly save_stack(), which has to unwind the stack and find the
corresponding stack depot handle.  Because the stack is always the same
for the initialization, unwind it once in init_pages_in_zone() and reuse
the handle.  Also avoid the repeated lookup_page_ext().

This can significantly reduce boot times with page_owner=on on large
machines, especially for kernels built without frame pointer, where the
stack unwinding is noticeably slower.
