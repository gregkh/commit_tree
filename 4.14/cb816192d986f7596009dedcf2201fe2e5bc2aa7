s390/qeth: fix using of ref counter for rxip addresses

IP-address setting and removal are delayed when the device is not yet in
state SOFTSETUP or UP. ref_counter has been implemented only for
ip-address with type normal. In this patch ref_counter logic is also used
for ip-address with type rxip to allow appropriate handling of multiple
postponed rxip add and del calls.
