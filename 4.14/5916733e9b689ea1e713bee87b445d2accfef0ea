usb: bdc: Fix misleading register names

The BDC endpoint status registers 0-7 were originally each going
to be an array of regsiters. This was later changed to being a
single register. The register definitions are being changed from:
"#define BDC_EPSTS0(n)  (0x60 + (n * 0x10))"
to
"#define BDC_EPSTS0	0x60"
to reflect this change and to avoid future coding mistakes.
