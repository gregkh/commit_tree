ACPI / watchdog: properly initialize resources

We copy a local resource structure into a list, but only
initialize some of its members, as pointed out by gcc-4.4:

drivers/acpi/acpi_watchdog.c: In function 'acpi_watchdog_init':
drivers/acpi/acpi_watchdog.c:105: error: 'res.child' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/acpi/acpi_watchdog.c:105: error: 'res.sibling' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/acpi/acpi_watchdog.c:105: error: 'res.parent' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/acpi/acpi_watchdog.c:105: error: 'res.desc' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/acpi/acpi_watchdog.c:105: error: 'res.name' may be used uninitialized in this function

Newer compilers can presumably optimize the uninitialized access
away entirely and don't warn at all, but rely on the kzalloc()
to zero the structure first. This adds an explicit initialization
to force consistent behavior.
