x86/mm, kexec: Fix memory corruption with SME on successive kexecs

After issuing successive kexecs it was found that the SHA hash failed
verification when booting the kexec'd kernel.  When SME is enabled, the
change from using pages that were marked encrypted to now being marked as
not encrypted (through new identify mapped page tables) results in memory
corruption if there are any cache entries for the previously encrypted
pages. This is because separate cache entries can exist for the same
physical location but tagged both with and without the encryption bit.

To prevent this, issue a wbinvd if SME is active before copying the pages
from the source location to the destination location to clear any possible
cache entry conflicts.
