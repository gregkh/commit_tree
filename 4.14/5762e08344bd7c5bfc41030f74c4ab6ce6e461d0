powerpc: Don't update CR0 in emulation of popcnt, prty, bpermd instructions

The architecture shows the least-significant bit of the instruction
word as reserved for the popcnt[bwd], prty[wd] and bpermd
instructions, that is, these instructions never update CR0.
Therefore this changes the emulation of these instructions to
skip the CR0 update.
