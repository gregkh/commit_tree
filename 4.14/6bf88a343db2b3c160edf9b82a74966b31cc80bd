ALSA: hda: Remove superfluous '-' added by printk conversion

While converting the error messages to the standard macros in the
commit 4e76a8833fac ("ALSA: hda - Replace with standard printk"), a
superfluous '-' slipped in the code mistakenly.  Its influence is
almost negligible, merely shows a dB value as negative integer instead
of positive integer (or vice versa) in the rare error message.
So let's kill this embarrassing byte to show more correct value.
