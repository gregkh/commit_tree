scsi: qla2xxx: Fix an integer overflow in sysfs code

The value of "size" comes from the user.  When we add "start + size" it
could lead to an integer overflow bug.

It means we vmalloc() a lot more memory than we had intended.  I believe
that on 64 bit systems vmalloc() can succeed even if we ask it to
allocate huge 4GB buffers.  So we would get memory corruption and likely
a crash when we call ha->isp_ops->write_optrom() and ->read_optrom().

Only root can trigger this bug.
