powerpc/smp: Rework CPU topology construction

The CPU scheduler topology is constructed from a number of per-cpu
cpumasks which describe which sets of logical CPUs are related in some
fashion. Current code that handles constructing these masks when CPUs
are hot(un)plugged can be simplified a bit by exploiting the fact that
the scheduler requires higher levels of the toplogy (e.g package level
groupings) to be supersets of the lower levels (e.g.  threas in a core).
This patch reworks the cpumask construction to be simpler and easier to
extend with extra topology levels.
