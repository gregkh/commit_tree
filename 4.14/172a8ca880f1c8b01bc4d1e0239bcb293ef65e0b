selftests: breakpoints: re-order TEST_GEN_PROGS targets

breakpoint_test can fail on arm64 with older/unpatched glibc:

 breakpoint_test_arm64.c: In function 'run_test':
 breakpoint_test_arm64.c:170:25: error: 'TRAP_HWBKPT' undeclared (first use
 in this function)

due to glibc missing several of the TRAP_* constants in the userspace
definitions. Specifically TRAP_BRANCH and TRAP_HWBKPT.
See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21286

It prevents to build step_after_suspend_test afterward, since make won't
continue.

We still want to be able to build and run the test, independently of
breakpoint_test_arm64 build failure. Re-order TEST_GEN_PROGS to be able to
build step_after_suspend_test first.
