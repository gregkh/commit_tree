drm/i915: Mark the GT as busy before idling the previous request

In a synchronous setup, we may retire the last request before we
complete allocating the next request. As the last request is retired, we
queue a timer to mark the device as idle, and promptly have to execute
ad cancel that timer once we complete allocating the request and need to
keep the device awake. If we rearrange the mark_busy() to occur before
we retire the previous request, we can skip this ping-pong.

v2: Joonas pointed out that unreserve_seqno() was now doing more than
doing seqno handling and should be renamed to reflect its wider purpose.
That also highlighted the new asymmetry with reserve_seqno(), so fixup
that and rename both to [un]reserve_engine().
