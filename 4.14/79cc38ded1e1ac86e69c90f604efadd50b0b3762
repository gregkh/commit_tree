powerpc/mm/hugetlb: Add support for reserving gigantic huge pages via kernel command line

With commit aa888a74977a8 ("hugetlb: support larger than MAX_ORDER") we added
support for allocating gigantic hugepages via kernel command line. Switch
ppc64 arch specific code to use that.

W.r.t FSL support, we now limit our allocation range using BOOTMEM_ALLOC_ACCESSIBLE.

We use the kernel command line to do reservation of hugetlb pages on powernv
platforms. On pseries hash mmu mode the supported gigantic huge page size is
16GB and that can only be allocated with hypervisor assist. For pseries the
command line option doesn't do the allocation. Instead pseries does gigantic
hugepage allocation based on hypervisor hint that is specified via
"ibm,expected#pages" property of the memory node.
