arm64: Ensure the instruction emulation is ready for userspace

We trap and emulate some instructions (e.g, mrs, deprecated instructions)
for the userspace. However the handlers for these are registered as
late_initcalls and the userspace could be up and running from the initramfs
by that time (with populate_rootfs, which is a rootfs_initcall()). This
could cause problems for the early applications ending up in failure
like :

[   11.152061] modprobe[93]: undefined instruction: pc=0000ffff8ca48ff4

This patch promotes the specific calls to core_initcalls, which are
guaranteed to be completed before we hit userspace.
