ARM: s3c24xx: Fix NAND ECC mode for mini2440 board

After commit e9f66ae23c20 ("mtd: s3c2410: make ecc mode configurable via
platform data") booting of the mini2440 board is broken, since
for this board we have CONFIG_MTD_NAND_S3C2410_HWECC set. The console
gets flooded with errors reported by the mtd subsystem.
This patch changes ecc_mode to NAND_ECC_HW which restores proper
operation of the NAND flash memory.
