xprtrdma: Remove imul instructions from rpcrdma_convert_iovs()

Re-arrange the pointer arithmetic in rpcrdma_convert_iovs() to
eliminate several integer multiplication instructions during
Transport Header encoding.

Also, array overflow does not occur outside development
environments, so replace overflow checking with one spot check
at the end. This reduces the number of conditional branches in
the common case.
