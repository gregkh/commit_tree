net/mlx5e: Early-return on empty completion queues

NAPI context handles different kinds of completion queues
(RX, TX, and others). Hence, upon a poll trial, some of them
might be empty.
Here we early-return upon empty completion queues, as well as
full rx buffer, and save unnecessary logic and memory barriers.
