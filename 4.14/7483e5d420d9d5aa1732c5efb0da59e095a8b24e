kcov: support compat processes

Support compat processes in KCOV by providing compat_ioctl callback.
Compat mode uses the same ioctl callback: we have 2 commands that do not
use the argument and 1 that already checks that the arg does not overflow
INT_MAX.  This allows to use KCOV-guided fuzzing in compat processes.
