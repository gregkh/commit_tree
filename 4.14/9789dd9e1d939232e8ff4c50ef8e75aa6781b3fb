xfs: perag initialization should only touch m_ag_max_usable for AG 0

We call __xfs_ag_resv_init to make a per-AG reservation for each AG.
This makes the reservation per-AG, not per-filesystem.  Therefore, it
is incorrect to adjust m_ag_max_usable for each AG.  Adjust it only
when we're reserving AG 0's blocks so that we only do it once per fs.
