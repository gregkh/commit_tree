fuse: honor iocb sync flags on write

If the IOCB_DSYNC flag is set a sync is not being performed by
fuse_file_write_iter.

Honor IOCB_DSYNC/IOCB_SYNC by setting O_DYSNC/O_SYNC respectively in the
flags filed of the write request.

We don't need to sync data or metadata, since fuse_perform_write() does
write-through and the filesystem is responsible for updating file times.
