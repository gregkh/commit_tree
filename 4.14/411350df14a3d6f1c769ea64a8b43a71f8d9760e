xfs: refactor xfs_trans_roll

Split xfs_trans_roll into a low-level helper that just rolls the
actual transaction and a new higher level xfs_trans_roll_inode
that takes care of logging and rejoining the inode.  This gets
rid of the NULL inode case, and allows to simplify the special
cases in the deferred operation code.
