ipv6: sr: implement several seg6local actions

This patch implements the following seg6local actions.

- SEG6_LOCAL_ACTION_END: regular SRH processing. The DA of the packet
  is updated to the next segment and forwarded accordingly.

- SEG6_LOCAL_ACTION_END_X: same as above, except that the packet is
  forwarded to the specified IPv6 next-hop.

- SEG6_LOCAL_ACTION_END_DX6: decapsulate the packet and forward to
  inner IPv6 packet to the specified IPv6 next-hop.

- SEG6_LOCAL_ACTION_END_B6: insert the specified SRH directly after
  the IPv6 header of the packet.

- SEG6_LOCAL_ACTION_END_B6_ENCAP: encapsulate the packet within
  an outer IPv6 header, containing the specified SRH.
