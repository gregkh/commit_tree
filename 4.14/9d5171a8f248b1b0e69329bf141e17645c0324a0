powerpc/powernv: Enable removal of memory for in memory tracing

The hardware trace macro feature requires access to a chunk of real
memory. This patch provides a debugfs interface to do this. By
writing an integer containing the size of memory to be unplugged into
/sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/memtrace/enable, the code will attempt to
remove that much memory from the end of each NUMA node.

This patch also adds additional debugsfs files for each node that
allows the tracer to interact with the removed memory, as well as
a trace file that allows userspace to read the generated trace.

Note that this patch does not invoke the hardware trace macro, it
only allows memory to be removed during runtime for the trace macro
to utilise.
