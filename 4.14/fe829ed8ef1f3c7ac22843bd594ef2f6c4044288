cpufreq: Add CPUFREQ_NO_AUTO_DYNAMIC_SWITCHING cpufreq driver flag

The policy->transition_latency field is used for multiple purposes
today and its not straight forward at all. This is how it is used:

A. Set the correct transition_latency value.

B. Set it to CPUFREQ_ETERNAL because:
   1. We don't want automatic dynamic switching (with
      ondemand/conservative) to happen at all.
   2. We don't know the transition latency.

This patch handles the B.1. case in a more readable way. A new flag for
the cpufreq drivers is added to disallow use of cpufreq governors which
have dynamic_switching flag set.

All the current cpufreq drivers which are setting transition_latency
unconditionally to CPUFREQ_ETERNAL are updated to use it. They don't
need to set transition_latency anymore.

There shouldn't be any functional change after this patch.
