KVM: x86: generalize guest_cpuid_has_ helpers

This patch turns guest_cpuid_has_XYZ(cpuid) into guest_cpuid_has(cpuid,
X86_FEATURE_XYZ), which gets rid of many very similar helpers.

When seeing a X86_FEATURE_*, we can know which cpuid it belongs to, but
this information isn't in common code, so we recreate it for KVM.

Add some BUILD_BUG_ONs to make sure that it runs nicely.
