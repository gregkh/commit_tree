KVM: arm/arm64: Fix guest external abort matching

The ARM-ARM has two bits in the ESR/HSR relevant to external aborts.
A range of {I,D}FSC values (of which bit 5 is always set) and bit 9 'EA'
which provides:
> an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED classification of External Aborts.

This bit is in addition to the {I,D}FSC range, and has an implementation
defined meaning. KVM should always ignore this bit when handling external
aborts from a guest.

Remove the ESR_ELx_EA definition and rewrite its helper
kvm_vcpu_dabt_isextabt() to check the {I,D}FSC range. This merges
kvm_vcpu_dabt_isextabt() and the recently added is_abort_sea() helper.
