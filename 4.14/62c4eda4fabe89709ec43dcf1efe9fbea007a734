powerpc/powernv/vas: Define vas_rx_win_open() interface

Define the vas_rx_win_open() interface. This interface is intended to
be used by the Nest Accelerator (NX) driver(s) to setup receive
windows for one or more NX engines (which implement compression &
encryption algorithms in the hardware).

Follow-on patches will provide an interface to close the window and to
open a send window that kernel subsystems can use to access the NX
engines.

The interface to open a receive window is expected to be invoked for
each instance of VAS in the system.
