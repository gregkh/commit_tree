powerpc/powernv/vas: Define vas_init() and vas_exit()

Implement vas_init() and vas_exit() functions for a new VAS module.
This VAS module is essentially a library for other device drivers
and kernel users of the NX coprocessors like NX-842 and NX-GZIP.
In the future this will be extended to add support for user space
to access the NX coprocessors.

VAS is currently only supported with 64K page size.
