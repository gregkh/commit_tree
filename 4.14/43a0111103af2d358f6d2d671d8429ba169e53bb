btrfs: use btrfsic_submit_bio instead of submit_bio in write_dev_flush

Although this bio has no data attached, it will reach this condition
(bio->bi_opf & REQ_PREFLUSH) and then update the flush_gen of dev_state
in __btrfsic_submit_bio. So we should still submit it through integrity
checker. Otherwise, the integrity checker will throw the following warning
when I mount a newly created btrfs filesystem.

[10264.755497] btrfs: attempt to write superblock which references block M @29523968 (sdb1/1111654400/0) which is not flushed out of disk's write cache (block flush_gen=1, dev->flush_gen=0)!
