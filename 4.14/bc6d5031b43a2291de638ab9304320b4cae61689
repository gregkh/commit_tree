bpf: do not test for PCPU_MIN_UNIT_SIZE before percpu allocations

PCPU_MIN_UNIT_SIZE is an implementation detail of the percpu
allocator. Given we support __GFP_NOWARN now, lets just let
the allocation request fail naturally instead. The two call
sites from BPF mistakenly assumed __GFP_NOWARN would work, so
no changes needed to their actual __alloc_percpu_gfp() calls
which use the flag already.
