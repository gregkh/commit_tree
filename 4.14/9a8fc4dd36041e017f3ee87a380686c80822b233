staging: typec: fusb302: Set max supply voltage to 5V

Anything higher then 5V may damage hardware not capable of it, so
the only sane default here is 5V. If a board is able to handle a
higher voltage that should come from board specific data such as
device-tree and not be hard coded into the fusb302 code.
