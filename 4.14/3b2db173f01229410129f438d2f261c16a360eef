MIPS: Remove unused R6000 support

The kernel contains a small amount of incomplete code aimed at
supporting old R6000 CPUs. This is:

  - Unused, as no machine selects CONFIG_SYS_HAS_CPU_R6000.

  - Broken, since there are glaring errors such as r6000_fpu.S moving
    the FCSR register to t1, then ignoring it & instead saving t0 into
    struct sigcontext...

  - A maintenance headache, since it's code that nobody can test which
    nevertheless imposes constraints on code which it shares with other
    machines.

Remove this incomplete & broken R6000 CPU support in order to clean up
and in preparation for changes which will no longer need to consider
dragging the pretense of R6000 support along with them.
