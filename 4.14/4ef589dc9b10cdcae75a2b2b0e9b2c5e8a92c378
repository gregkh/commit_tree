mm/hmm/devmem: device memory hotplug using ZONE_DEVICE

This introduce a simple struct and associated helpers for device driver to
use when hotpluging un-addressable device memory as ZONE_DEVICE.  It will
find a unuse physical address range and trigger memory hotplug for it
which allocates and initialize struct page for the device memory.

Device driver should use this helper during device initialization to
hotplug the device memory.  It should only need to remove the memory once
the device is going offline (shutdown or hotremove).  There should not be
any userspace API to hotplug memory expect maybe for host device driver to
allow to add more memory to a guest device driver.

Device's memory is manage by the device driver and HMM only provides
helpers to that effect.
