percpu: keep track of the best offset for contig hints

This patch makes the contig hint starting offset optimization from the
previous patch as honest as it can be. For both chunk and block starting
offsets, make sure it keeps the starting offset with the best alignment.

The block skip optimization is added in a later patch when the
pcpu_find_block_fit iterator is swapped in.
