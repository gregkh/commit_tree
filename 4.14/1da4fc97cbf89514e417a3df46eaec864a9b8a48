sctp: fix some type cast warnings introduced by stream reconf

These warnings were found by running 'make C=2 M=net/sctp/'.

They are introduced by not aware of Endian when coding stream
reconf patches.

Since commit c0d8bab6ae51 ("sctp: add get and set sockopt for
reconf_enable") enabled stream reconf feature for users, the
Fixes tag below would use it.
