dmaengine: add DMA_PREP_CMD for non-Data descriptors.

Some of the DMA controllers are capable of issuing the commands
to peripheral by the DMA. These commands can be list of register
reads/writes and its different from normal data reads/writes.
This patch adds new flag DMA_PREP_CMD in DMA API which tells
the driver that the data passed to DMA API is command data
and DMA controller driver will form descriptor in the required
format.

This flag can be used by any DMA controller driver which requires
the descriptor in different format for non-Data descriptors.
