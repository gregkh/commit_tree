packet: hold bind lock when rebinding to fanout hook

Packet socket bind operations must hold the po->bind_lock. This keeps
po->running consistent with whether the socket is actually on a ptype
list to receive packets.

fanout_add unbinds a socket and its packet_rcv/tpacket_rcv call, then
binds the fanout object to receive through packet_rcv_fanout.

Make it hold the po->bind_lock when testing po->running and rebinding.
Else, it can race with other rebind operations, such as that in
packet_set_ring from packet_rcv to tpacket_rcv. Concurrent updates
can result in a socket being added to a fanout group twice, causing
use-after-free KASAN bug reports, among others.

Reported independently by both trinity and syzkaller.
Verified that the syzkaller reproducer passes after this patch.
