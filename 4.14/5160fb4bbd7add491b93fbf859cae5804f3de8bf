media: omap3isp: fix uninitialized variable use

A debug printk statement was copied incorrectly into the new
csi1 parser code and causes a warning there:

drivers/media/platform/omap3isp/isp.c: In function 'isp_probe':
include/linux/dynamic_debug.h:134:3: error: 'i' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Since there is only one lane, the index is never set. This
changes the debug print to always print a zero instead,
keeping the original format of the message.

Fixes: 9211434bad30 ("media: omap3isp: Parse CSI1 configuration from the device tree")
