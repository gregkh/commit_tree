scsi: qla2xxx: Reset the logo flag, after target re-login.

After relogin is sucessful, "send_els_logo" flag needs to be
reinitialized. This will allow next re-login to happen successfully.

In target mode, this flag was not reset correctly, causing IO's failure
during reset recovery and port ON/OFF test cases from initiator.
