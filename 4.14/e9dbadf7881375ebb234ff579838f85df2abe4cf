scsi: g_NCR5380: End PDMA transfer correctly on target disconnection

When an IRQ arrives during PDMA transfer, pread() and pwrite() return
without waiting for the 53C80 registers to be ready and this ends up
messing up the chip state. This was observed with SONY CDU-55S which is
slow enough to disconnect during 4096-byte reads.

IRQ during PDMA is not an error so don't return -1. Instead, store the
remaining byte count for use by NCR5380_dma_residual().

[Poll for the BASR_END_DMA_TRANSFER condition rather than remove the
error message -- F.T.]
