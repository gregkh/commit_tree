powerpc/mm: Cleanup check for stack expansion

When hitting below a VM_GROWSDOWN vma (typically growing the stack),
we check whether it's a valid stack-growing instruction and we
check the distance to GPR1. This is largely open coded with lots
of comments, so move it out to a helper.

While at it, make store_update_sp a boolean.
