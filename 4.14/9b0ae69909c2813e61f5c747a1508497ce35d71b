staging: typec: tcpm: set port type callback

The port type callback call enquires the tcpc_dev if
the requested port type is supported. If supported, then
performs a tcpm reset if required after setting the tcpm
internal port_type variable.

Check against the tcpm port_type instead of checking
against caps.type as port_type reflects the current
configuration.
