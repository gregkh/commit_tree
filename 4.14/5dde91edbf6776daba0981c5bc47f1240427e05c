perf trace beauty: Introduce syscall arg beautifier for long integers

Will be used in the fcntl arg beautifier, that nowadays formats as '%ld'
because there is no explicit arg beautifier attached, but as we will
have to first decide what beautifier to use (i.e. it may be a pointer,
etc) then we need to have this exported as a separate beautifier to be
called from there.
