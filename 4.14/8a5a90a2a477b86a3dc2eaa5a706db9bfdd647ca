tty: fix __tty_insert_flip_char regression

Sergey noticed a small but fatal mistake in __tty_insert_flip_char,
leading to an oops in an interrupt handler when using any serial
port.

The problem is that I accidentally took the tty_buffer pointer
before calling __tty_buffer_request_room(), which replaces the
buffer. This moves the pointer lookup to the right place after
allocating the new buffer space.
