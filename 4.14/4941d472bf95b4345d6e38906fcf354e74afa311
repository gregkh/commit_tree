virtio-net: do not reset during XDP set

We currently reset the device during XDP set, the main reason is
that we allocate more headroom with XDP (for header adjustment).

This works but causes network downtime for users.

Previous patches encoded the headroom in the buffer context,
this makes it possible to detect the case where a buffer
with headroom insufficient for XDP is added to the queue and
XDP is enabled afterwards.

Upon detection, we handle this case by copying the packet
(slow, but it's a temporary condition).
