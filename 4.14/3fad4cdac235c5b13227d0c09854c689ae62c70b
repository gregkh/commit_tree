irqchip/gic-v3: Iterate over possible CPUs by for_each_possible_cpu()

get_cpu_number() doesn't use existing helper to iterate over possible
CPUs, It will cause an error in case of discontinuous @cpu_possible_mask
such as 0b11110001, which can result from a core having failed to come
up on a SMP machine.

Fixed by using existing helper for_each_possible_cpu().
