net: mvpp2: initialize the comphy

On some platforms, the comphy is between the MAC GoP and the PHYs. The
mvpp2 driver currently relies on the firmware/bootloader to configure
the comphy. As a comphy driver was added to the generic PHY framework,
this patch uses it in the mvpp2 driver to configure the comphy at boot
time to avoid relying on the bootloader.
