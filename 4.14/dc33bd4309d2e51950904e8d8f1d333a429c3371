staging: rtlwifi: check for array overflow

Smatch is distrustful of the "capab" value and marks it as user
controlled.  I think it actually comes from the firmware?  Anyway, I
looked at other drivers and they added a bounds check and it seems like
a harmless thing to have so I have added it here as well.
