signal: Fix name of SIGEMT in #if defined() check

Commit cc731525f26a ("signal: Remove kernel interal si_code magic")
added a check for SIGMET and NSIGEMT being defined. That SIGMET should
in fact be SIGEMT, with SIGEMT being defined in
arch/{alpha,mips,sparc}/include/uapi/asm/signal.h

This was actually pointed out by BenHutchings in a lwn.net comment
here https://lwn.net/Comments/734608/
