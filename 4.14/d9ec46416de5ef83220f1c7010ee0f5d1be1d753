dmaengine: altera: fix response FIFO emptying

Commit 6084fc2ec478 ("dmaengine: altera: Use macros instead of structs
to describe the registers") introduced a minus sign before a register
offset.

This leads to soft-locks of the DMA controller, since reading the last
status byte is required to pop the response from the FIFO. Failing to
do so will lead to a full FIFO, which means that the DMA controller
will stop processing descriptors.
