drm/i915: enable WaDisableDopClkGating for skl

This WA is required when decoupled frequencies for slice and unslice
are enabled. This disables DOP clock gating for skl.

v2: enable the WA for all gen9 platforms (not just for SKL GT4 where
    the hang issue is originally reported) to avoid rare hangs (David)
v3: as per WaDatabase, enable it only for SKL (Rodrigo)
