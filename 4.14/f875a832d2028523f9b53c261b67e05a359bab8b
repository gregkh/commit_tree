MIPS: Abstract CPU core & VP(E) ID access through accessor functions

We currently have fields in struct cpuinfo_mips for the core & VP(E) ID
of a particular CPU, and various pieces of code directly access those
fields. This patch abstracts such access by introducing accessor
functions cpu_core(), cpu_set_core(), cpu_vpe_id() & cpu_set_vpe_id()
and having code that needs to access these values call those functions
rather than directly accessing the struct cpuinfo_mips fields. This
prepares us for changes to the way in which those values are stored in
later patches.

The cpu_vpe_id() function is introduced even though we already had a
cpu_vpe_id() macro for a couple of reasons:

  1) It's more consistent with the core, and future cluster, accessors.

  2) It ensures a sensible return type without explicit casts.

  3) It's generally preferable to use functions rather than macros.
