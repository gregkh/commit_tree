PM / suspend: Export pm_suspend_target_state

Have the core suspend/resume framework store the system-wide suspend
state (suspend_state_t) we are about to enter, and expose it to drivers
via pm_suspend_target_state in order to retrieve that. The state is
assigned in suspend_devices_and_enter().

This is useful for platform specific drivers that may need to take a
slightly different suspend/resume path based on the system's
suspend/resume state being entered.
