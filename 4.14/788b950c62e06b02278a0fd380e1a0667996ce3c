cgroup: distinguish local and children populated states

cgrp->populated_cnt counts both local (the cgroup's populated
css_sets) and subtree proper (populated children) so that it's only
zero when the whole subtree, including self, is empty.

This patch splits the counter into two so that local and children
populated states are tracked separately.  It allows finer-grained
tests on the state of the hierarchy which will be used to replace
css_set walking local populated test.
