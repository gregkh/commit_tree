NFS: Further optimise nfs_lock_and_join_requests()

When locking the entire group in order to remove subrequests,
the locks are always taken in order, and with the page group
lock being taken after the page head is locked. The intention
is that:

1) The lock on the group head guarantees that requests may not
   be removed from the group (although new entries could be appended
   if we're not holding the group lock).
2) It is safe to drop and retake the page group lock while iterating
   through the list, in particular when waiting for a subrequest lock.
