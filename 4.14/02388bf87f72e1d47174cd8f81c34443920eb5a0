isdn/i4l: fetch the ppp_write buffer in one shot

In isdn_ppp_write(), the header (i.e., protobuf) of the buffer is
fetched twice from userspace. The first fetch is used to peek at the
protocol of the message and reset the huptimer if necessary; while the
second fetch copies in the whole buffer. However, given that buf resides
in userspace memory, a user process can race to change its memory content
across fetches. By doing so, we can either avoid resetting the huptimer
for any type of packets (by first setting proto to PPP_LCP and later
change to the actual type) or force resetting the huptimer for LCP
packets.

This patch changes this double-fetch behavior into two single fetches
decided by condition (lp->isdn_device < 0 || lp->isdn_channel <0).
