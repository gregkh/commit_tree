media: drxj: make several const arrays static

Don't populate const arrays on the stack but instead make them static.
Makes the object code smaller by over 1800 bytes:

Before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  94100	   9160	      0	 103260	  1935c	drxj.o

After:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  91044	  10400	      0	 101444	  18c44	drxj.o
