Update MIPS email addresses

MIPS will soon not be a part of Imagination Technologies, and as such
many @imgtec.com email addresses will no longer be valid. This patch
updates the addresses for those who:

 - Have 10 or more patches in mainline authored using an @imgtec.com
   email address, or any patches dated within the past year.

 - Are still with Imagination but leaving as part of the MIPS business
   unit, as determined from an internal email address list.

 - Haven't already updated their email address (ie. JamesH) or expressed
   a desire to be excluded (ie. Maciej).

 - Acked v2 or earlier of this patch, which leaves Deng-Cheng, Matt &
   myself.

New addresses are of the form firstname.lastname@mips.com, and all
verified against an internal email address list.  An entry is added to
.mailmap for each person such that get_maintainer.pl will report the new
addresses rather than @imgtec.com addresses which will soon be dead.

Instances of the affected addresses throughout the tree are then
mechanically replaced with the new @mips.com address.
