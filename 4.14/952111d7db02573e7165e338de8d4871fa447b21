arch: Remove spin_unlock_wait() arch-specific definitions

There is no agreed-upon definition of spin_unlock_wait()'s semantics,
and it appears that all callers could do just as well with a lock/unlock
pair.  This commit therefore removes the underlying arch-specific
arch_spin_unlock_wait() for all architectures providing them.
