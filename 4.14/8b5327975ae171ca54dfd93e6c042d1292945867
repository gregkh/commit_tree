netvsc: allow controlling send/recv buffer size

Control the size of the buffer areas via ethtool ring settings.
They aren't really traditional hardware rings, but host API breaks
receive and send buffer into chunks. The final size of the chunks are
controlled by the host.

The default value of send and receive buffer area for host DMA
is much larger than it needs to be. Experimentation shows that
4M receive and 1M send is sufficient.
