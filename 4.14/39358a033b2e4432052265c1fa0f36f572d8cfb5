objtool, x86: Add facility for asm code to provide unwind hints

Some asm (and inline asm) code does special things to the stack which
objtool can't understand.  (Nor can GCC or GNU assembler, for that
matter.)  In such cases we need a facility for the code to provide
annotations, so the unwinder can unwind through it.

This provides such a facility, in the form of unwind hints.  They're
similar to the GNU assembler .cfi* directives, but they give more
information, and are needed in far fewer places, because objtool can
fill in the blanks by following branches and adjusting the stack pointer
for pushes and pops.
