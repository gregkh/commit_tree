btrfs: Prevent possible ERR_PTR() dereference

In btrfs_full_stripe_len/btrfs_is_parity_mirror we have similar code which
gets the chunk map for a particular range via get_chunk_map. However,
get_chunk_map can return an ERR_PTR value and while the 2 callers do catch
this with a WARN_ON they then proceed to indiscriminately dereference the
extent map. This of course leads to a crash. Fix the offenders by making the
dereference conditional on IS_ERR.
