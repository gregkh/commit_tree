rcu: Localize rcu_state ->orphan_pend and ->orphan_done

Given that the rcu_state structure's >orphan_pend and ->orphan_done
fields are used only during migration of callbacks from the recently
offlined CPU to a surviving CPU, if rcu_send_cbs_to_orphanage() and
rcu_adopt_orphan_cbs() are combined, these fields can become local
variables in the combined function.  This commit therefore combines
rcu_send_cbs_to_orphanage() and rcu_adopt_orphan_cbs() into a new
rcu_segcblist_merge() function and removes the ->orphan_pend and
->orphan_done fields.
