parisc: Fix double-word compare and exchange in LWS code on 32-bit kernels

As discussed on the debian-hppa list, double-wordcompare and exchange
operations fail on 32-bit kernels.  Looking at the code, I realized that
the ",ma" completer does the wrong thing in the  "ldw,ma  4(%r26), %r29"
instruction.  This increments %r26 and causes the following store to
write to the wrong location.

Note by Helge Deller:
The patch applies cleanly to stable kernel series if this upstream
commit is merged in advance:
f4125cfdb300 ("parisc: Avoid trashing sr2 and sr3 in LWS code").
