block,bfq: refactor device-idling logic

The logic that decides whether to idle the device is scattered across
three functions. Almost all of the logic is in the function
bfq_bfqq_may_idle, but (1) part of the decision is made in
bfq_update_idle_window, and (2) the function bfq_bfqq_must_idle may
switch off idling regardless of the output of bfq_bfqq_may_idle. In
addition, both bfq_update_idle_window and bfq_bfqq_must_idle make
their decisions as a function of parameters that are used, for similar
purposes, also in bfq_bfqq_may_idle. This commit addresses these
issues by moving all the logic into bfq_bfqq_may_idle.
