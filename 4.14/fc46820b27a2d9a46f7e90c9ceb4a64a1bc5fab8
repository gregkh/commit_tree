vfs: Return -ENXIO for negative SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA offsets

In generic_file_llseek_size, return -ENXIO for negative offsets as well
as offsets beyond EOF.  This affects filesystems which don't implement
SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA internally, possibly because they don't support
holes.

Fixes xfstest generic/448.
