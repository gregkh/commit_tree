usb: renesas_usbhs: fix usbhsf_fifo_clear() for RX direction

This patch fixes an issue that the usbhsf_fifo_clear() is possible
to cause 10 msec delay if the pipe is RX direction and empty because
the FRDY bit will never be set to 1 in such case.

Fixes: e8d548d54968 ("usb: renesas_usbhs: fifo became independent from pipe.")
