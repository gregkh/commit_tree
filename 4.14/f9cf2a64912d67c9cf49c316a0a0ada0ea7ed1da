nvmet: synchronize sqhd update

In testing target io in read write mix, we did indeed get into cases where
sqhd didn't update properly and slowly missed enough updates to shutdown
the queue.

Protect the updating sqhd by using cmpxchg, and for that turn the sqhd
field into a u32 so that cmpxchg works on it for all architectures.
