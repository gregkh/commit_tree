cpufreq: schedutil: Don't restrict kthread to related_cpus unnecessarily

Utilization update callbacks are now processed remotely, even on the
CPUs that don't share cpufreq policy with the target CPU (if
dvfs_possible_from_any_cpu flag is set).

But in non-fast switch paths, the frequency is changed only from one of
policy->related_cpus. This happens because the kthread which does the
actual update is bound to a subset of CPUs (i.e. related_cpus).

Allow frequency to be remotely updated as well (i.e. call
__cpufreq_driver_target()) if dvfs_possible_from_any_cpu flag is set.
