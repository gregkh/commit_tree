usb: gadget: core: unmap request from DMA only if previously mapped

In the SG case this is already handled since a non-zero
request->num_mapped_sgs is a clear indicator that dma_map_sg()
had been called. While it would be nice to do the same for the
singly mapped case by simply checking for non-zero request->dma,
it's conceivable that 0 is a valid dma_addr_t handle. Hence add
a flag 'dma_mapped' to struct usb_request and use this to
determine the need to call dma_unmap_single(). Otherwise, if a
request is not DMA mapped then the result of calling
usb_request_unmap_request() would safely be a no-op.
