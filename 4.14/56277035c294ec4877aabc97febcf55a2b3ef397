staging: typec: tcpm: Switch to PORT_RESET instead of SNK_UNATTACHED

When VBUS is not discovered within PD_T_PS_SOURCE_ON although Rp
is detected on CC, TCPM switches the port to SNK_UNATTACHED
state. SNK_UNATTACHED, however does not force TYPEC_CC_OPEN which
makes the partner(source) to think that it is connected.

To overcome this issue, force the port into PORT_RESET state
to make sure the CC lines are open.
