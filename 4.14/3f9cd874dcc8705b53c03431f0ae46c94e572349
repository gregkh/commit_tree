ARC: [plat-eznps] avoid toggling of DPC register

HW bug description: in case of HW thread context switch
the dpc configuration of the exiting thread is dragged
one cycle into the next thread.
In order to avoid the consequences of this bug, the DPC register
is set to an initial value, and not changed afterwards.
