nvme-pci: use appropriate initial chunk size for HMB allocation

The initial chunk size for host memory buffer allocation is currently
PAGE_SIZE << MAX_ORDER.  MAX_ORDER order allocation is usually failed
without CONFIG_DMA_CMA.  So the HMB allocation is retried with chunk size
PAGE_SIZE << (MAX_ORDER - 1) in general, but there is no problem if the
retry allocation works correctly.
