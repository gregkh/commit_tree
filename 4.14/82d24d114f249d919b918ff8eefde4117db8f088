arm64: compat: Remove leftover variable declaration

Commit a1d5ebaf8ccd ("arm64: big-endian: don't treat code as data when
copying sigret code") moved the 32-bit sigreturn trampoline code from
the aarch32_sigret_code array to kuser32.S. The commit removed the
array definition from signal32.c, but not its declaration in
signal32.h. Remove the leftover declaration.
