mm: rename global_page_state to global_zone_page_state

global_page_state is error prone as a recent bug report pointed out [1].
It only returns proper values for zone based counters as the enum it
gets suggests.  We already have global_node_page_state so let's rename
global_page_state to global_zone_page_state to be more explicit here.
All existing users seems to be correct:

$ git grep "global_page_state(NR_" | sed 's@.*(\(NR_[A-Z_]*\)).*@\1@' | sort | uniq -c
      2 NR_BOUNCE
      2 NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES
     11 NR_FREE_PAGES
      1 NR_KERNEL_STACK_KB
      1 NR_MLOCK
      2 NR_PAGETABLE

This patch shouldn't introduce any functional change.
