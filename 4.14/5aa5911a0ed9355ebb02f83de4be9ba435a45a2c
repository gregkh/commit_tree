ACPI / blacklist: add acpi_match_platform_list()

ACPI OEM ID / OEM Table ID / Revision can be used to identify
a platform based on ACPI firmware info.  acpi_blacklisted(),
intel_pstate_platform_pwr_mgmt_exists(), and some other funcs,
have been using similar check to detect a list of platforms
that require special handlings.

Move the platform check in acpi_blacklisted() to a new common
utility function, acpi_match_platform_list(), so that other
drivers do not have to implement their own version.

There is no change in functionality.
