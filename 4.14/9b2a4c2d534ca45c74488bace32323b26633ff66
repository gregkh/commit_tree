wil6210: fix interface-up check

While wil_open is executed, any call to netif_running
would return a success. In case there are failures
within wil_open, should not treat the device as if it
is already opened in relevant functions (like FW recovery
and runtime suspend check).

Fix that by checking the device up flag instead.
