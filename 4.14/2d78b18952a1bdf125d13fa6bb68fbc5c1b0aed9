perf report: Show branch type statistics for stdio mode

Show the branch type statistics at the end of perf report --stdio.

For example:

  perf report --stdio

  COND_FWD:  28.5%
  COND_BWD:   9.4%
  CROSS_4K:   0.7%
  CROSS_2M:  14.1%
      COND:  37.9%
    UNCOND:   0.2%
       IND:   6.7%
      CALL:  26.5%
       RET:  28.7%
    SYSRET:   0.0%

  The branch types are:

   COND_FWD: conditional forward
   COND_BWD: conditional backward
       COND: conditional branch
     UNCOND: unconditional branch
        IND: indirect
       CALL: function call
     IND_CALL: indirect function call
        RET: function return
    SYSCALL: syscall
     SYSRET: syscall return
  COND_CALL: conditional function call
   COND_RET: conditional function return

CROSS_4K and CROSS_2M:

They are the metrics checking for branches cross 4K or 2MB pages.
It's an approximate computing. We don't know if the area is 4K or
2MB, so always compute both.

To make the output simple, if a branch crosses 2M area, CROSS_4K
will not be incremented.

Change log

v7: Since the common branch type definitions are changed, some
    tags/strings are updated accordingly.

v6: Remove branch_type_stat_display() since it's moved to branch.c.

v5: Remove the unnecessary sort__mode checking in
    hist_iter__branch_callback().

v4: Comparing to previous version, the major changes are:

Add the computing of JCC forward/JCC backward and cross page checking
by using the from and to addresses.
