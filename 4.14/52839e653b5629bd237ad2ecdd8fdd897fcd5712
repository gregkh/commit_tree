perf tools: Add support for printing new mem_info encodings

Add decoding for the new "lvlx" and "snoopx" meminfo fields added
earlier to the kernel so that "perf mem report" and other tools can
print it properly.

v2: Merge with persistent memory patch.
Switch to new bit encoding for each combination.

v3: Switch to generic lvlnum field.
