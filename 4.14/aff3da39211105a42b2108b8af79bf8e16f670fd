net: mvpp2: fix parsing fragmentation detection

Parsing fragmentation detection failed due to wrong configured
parser TCAM entry's. Some traffic was marked as fragmented in RX
descriptor, even it wasn't IP fragmented. The hardware also failed to
calculate checksums which lead to use software checksum and caused
performance degradation.
