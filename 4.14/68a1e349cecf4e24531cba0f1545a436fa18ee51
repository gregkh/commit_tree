rtmutex: update rt-mutex

The rtmutex remove a pending owner bit in in rt_mutex::owner, in
commit 8161239a8bcc ("rtmutex: Simplify PI algorithm and make highest prio task get lock")
But the document was changed accordingly. Updating it to a meaningful
state.

BTW, as 'Steven Rostedt' mentioned:
There is still technically a "Pending Owner", it's just not called
that anymore. The pending owner happens to be the top_waiter of a lock
that has no owner and has been woken up to grab the lock.
