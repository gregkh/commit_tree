btrfs: simplify btrfs_dev_replace_kthread

This function prints an informative message and then continues
dev-replace. The message contains a progress percentage which is read
from the status. The status is allocated dynamically, about 2600 bytes,
just to read the single value. That's an overkill. We'll use the new
helper and drop the allocation.
