x86/mm: Tidy up "x86/mm: Flush more aggressively in lazy TLB mode"

Due to timezones, commit:

  b956575bed91 ("x86/mm: Flush more aggressively in lazy TLB mode")

was an outdated patch that well tested and fixed the bug but didn't
address Borislav's review comments.

Tidy it up:

 - The name "tlb_use_lazy_mode()" was highly confusing.  Change it to
   "tlb_defer_switch_to_init_mm()", which describes what it actually
   means.

 - Move the static_branch crap into a helper.

 - Improve comments.

Actually removing the debugfs option is in the next patch.
