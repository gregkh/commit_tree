media: drv-intf: saa7146: constify pci_device_id

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.
So making 'pci_tbl' as const member of 'struct saa7146_extension'.
