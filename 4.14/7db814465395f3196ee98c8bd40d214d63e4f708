nvme-rdma: fix possible hang when issuing commands during ctrl removal

nvme_rdma_queue_is_ready() fails requests in case a queue is not
LIVE. If the controller is in RECONNECTING state, we might be in
this state for a long time (until we successfully reconnect) and
we are better off with failing the request fast. Otherwise, we
fail with BLK_STS_RESOURCE to have the block layer try again
soon.

In case we are removing the controller when the admin queue
is not LIVE, we will terminate the request with BLK_STS_RESOURCE
but it happens before we call blk_mq_start_request() so the
request timeout never expires, and the queue will never get
back to LIVE (because we are removing the controller). This
causes the removal operation to block infinitly [1].

Thus, if we are removing (state DELETING), and the queue is
not LIVE, we need to fail the request permanently as there is
no chance for it to ever complete successfully.
