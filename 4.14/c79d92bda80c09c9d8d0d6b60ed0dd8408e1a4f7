[  130.893355] state change SNK_DEBOUNCED -> SRC_TRY
[  130.893363] cc:=3
[  130.893490] pending state change SRC_TRY -> SNK_TRYWAIT @ 100 ms
[  130.895602] CC1: 3 -> 0, CC2: 0 -> 0 [state SRC_TRY, polarity 0, disconnected]
[  130.895613] state change SRC_TRY -> SRC_TRY_DEBOUNCE
[  130.895621] pending state change SRC_TRY_DEBOUNCE -> SRC_ATTACHED @ 20 ms
[  130.916843] state change SRC_TRY_DEBOUNCE -> SRC_ATTACHED [delayed 20 ms]

Although the CC state was changing to TYPEC_CC_OPEN, the port entered
SRC_TRY_DEBOUNCE from SRC_TRY. The port must enter SRC_TRY_DEBOUNCE only
if the CC state is TYPEC_CC_RD.
