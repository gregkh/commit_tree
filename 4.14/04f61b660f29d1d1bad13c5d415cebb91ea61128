powerpc/8xx: remove CONFIG_8xx

Two config options exist to define powerpc MPC8xx:
* CONFIG_PPC_8xx
* CONFIG_8xx

arch/powerpc/platforms/Kconfig.cputype has contained the following
comment about CONFIG_8xx item for some years:
"# this is temp to handle compat with arch=ppc"

There is no more users of CONFIG_8xx, so remove it.
