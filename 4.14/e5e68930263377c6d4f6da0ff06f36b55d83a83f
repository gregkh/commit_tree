mm, memory_hotplug: display allowed zones in the preferred ordering

Prior to commit f1dd2cd13c4b ("mm, memory_hotplug: do not associate
hotadded memory to zones until online") we used to allow to change the
valid zone types of a memory block if it is adjacent to a different zone
type.

This fact was reflected in memoryNN/valid_zones by the ordering of
printed zones.  The first one was default (echo online > memoryNN/state)
and the other one could be onlined explicitly by online_{movable,kernel}.

This behavior was removed by the said patch and as such the ordering was
not all that important.  In most cases a kernel zone would be default
anyway.  The only exception is movable_node handled by "mm,
memory_hotplug: support movable_node for hotpluggable nodes".

Let's reintroduce this behavior again because later patch will remove
the zone overlap restriction and so user will be allowed to online
kernel resp.  movable block regardless of its placement.  Original
behavior will then become significant again because it would be
non-trivial for users to see what is the default zone to online into.

Implementation is really simple.  Pull out zone selection out of
move_pfn_range into zone_for_pfn_range helper and use it in
show_valid_zones to display the zone for default onlining and then both
kernel and movable if they are allowed.  Default online zone is not
duplicated.
