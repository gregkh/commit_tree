net: ipv6: add second dif to udp socket lookups

Add a second device index, sdif, to udp socket lookups. sdif is the
index for ingress devices enslaved to an l3mdev. It allows the lookups
to consider the enslaved device as well as the L3 domain when searching
for a socket.

Early demux lookups are handled in the next patch as part of INET_MATCH
changes.
