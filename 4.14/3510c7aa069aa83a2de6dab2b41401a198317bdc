ALSA: seq: Avoid invalid lockdep class warning

The recent fix for adding rwsem nesting annotation was using the given
"hop" argument as the lock subclass key.  Although the idea itself
works, it may trigger a kernel warning like:
  BUG: looking up invalid subclass: 8
  ....
since the lockdep has a smaller number of subclasses (8) than we
currently allow for the hops there (10).

The current definition is merely a sanity check for avoiding the too
deep delivery paths, and the 8 hops are already enough.  So, as a
quick fix, just follow the max hops as same as the max lockdep
subclasses.
