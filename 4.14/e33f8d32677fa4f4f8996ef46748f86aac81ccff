arm/syscalls: Optimize address limit check

Disable the generic address limit check in favor of an architecture
specific optimized implementation. The generic implementation using
pending work flags did not work well with ARM and alignment faults.

The address limit is checked on each syscall return path to user-mode
path as well as the irq user-mode return function. If the address limit
was changed, a function is called to report data corruption (stopping
the kernel or process based on configuration).

The address limit check has to be done before any pending work because
they can reset the address limit and the process is killed using a
SIGKILL signal. For example the lkdtm address limit check does not work
because the signal to kill the process will reset the user-mode address
limit.
