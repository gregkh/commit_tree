objtool: Disable GCC '-Wpacked' warnings

Objtool is failing to build with GCC 4.4.7 due to the following
warnings:

  cc1: warnings being treated as errors
  In file included from orc.h:21,
                   from orc_gen.c:21:
  orc_types.h:86: error: packed attribute is unnecessary for ‘sp_offset’
  orc_types.h:87: error: packed attribute is unnecessary for ‘bp_offset’
  orc_types.h:88: error: packed attribute is unnecessary for ‘sp_reg’

I suspect those warnings are a GCC bug.  But -Wpacked isn't very useful
anyway, so just disable it.
