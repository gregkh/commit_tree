powerpc/mm: Fix kernel RAM protection after freeing unused memory on PPC32

As seen below, allthough the init sections have been freed, the
associated memory area is still marked as executable in the
page tables.

~ dmesg
[    5.860093] Freeing unused kernel memory: 592K (c0570000 - c0604000)

~ cat /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables
---[ Start of kernel VM ]---
0xc0000000-0xc0497fff        4704K  rw  X  present dirty accessed shared
0xc0498000-0xc056ffff         864K  rw     present dirty accessed shared
0xc0570000-0xc059ffff         192K  rw  X  present dirty accessed shared
0xc05a0000-0xc7ffffff      125312K  rw     present dirty accessed shared
---[ vmalloc() Area ]---

This patch fixes that.

The implementation is done by reusing the change_page_attr()
function implemented for CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
