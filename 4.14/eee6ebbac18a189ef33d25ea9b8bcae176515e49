netfilter: nf_nat_h323: fix logical-not-parentheses warning

Clang produces the following warning:

net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_h323.c:553:6: error:
logical not is only applied to the left hand side of this comparison
  [-Werror,-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
if (!set_h225_addr(skb, protoff, data, dataoff, taddr,
    ^
add parentheses after the '!' to evaluate the comparison first
add parentheses around left hand side expression to silence this warning

There's not necessarily a bug here, but it's cleaner to return early,
ex:

if (x)
  return
...

rather than:

if (x == 0)
  ...
else
  return

Also added a return code check that seemed to be missing in one
instance.
