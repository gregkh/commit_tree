perf/x86/intel: Record branch type

Perf already has support for disassembling the branch instruction
and using the branch type for filtering. The patch just records
the branch type in perf_branch_entry.

Before recording, the patch converts the x86 branch type to
common branch type.

Change log:

v10: Set the branch_map array to be static. The previous version
     has it on stack then makes the compiler to create it every
     time when the function gets called.

v9: Use __ffs() to find first bit in type in common_branch_type().
    It lets the code be clear.

v8: Change PERF_BR_NONE to PERF_BR_UNKNOWN.

v7: Just convert following x86 branch types to common branch types.

X86_BR_CALL      -> PERF_BR_CALL
X86_BR_RET       -> PERF_BR_RET
X86_BR_JCC       -> PERF_BR_COND
X86_BR_JMP       -> PERF_BR_UNCOND
X86_BR_IND_CALL  -> PERF_BR_IND_CALL
X86_BR_ZERO_CALL -> PERF_BR_CALL
X86_BR_IND_JMP   -> PERF_BR_IND
X86_BR_SYSCALL   -> PERF_BR_SYSCALL
X86_BR_SYSRET    -> PERF_BR_SYSRET

Others are set to PERF_BR_NONE

v6: Not changed.

v5: Just fix the merge error. No other update.

v4: Comparing to previous version, the major changes are:

1. Uses a lookup table to convert x86 branch type to common branch
   type.

2. Move the JCC forward/JCC backward and cross page computing to
   user space.

3. Initialize branch type to 0 in intel_pmu_lbr_read_32 and
   intel_pmu_lbr_read_64
