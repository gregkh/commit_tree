xfs: open code end_buffer_async_write in xfs_finish_page_writeback

Our loop in xfs_finish_page_writeback, which iterates over all buffer
heads in a page and then calls end_buffer_async_write, which also
iterates over all buffers in the page to check if any I/O is in flight
is not only inefficient, but also potentially dangerous as
end_buffer_async_write can cause the page and all buffers to be freed.

Replace it with a single loop that does the work of end_buffer_async_write
on a per-page basis.
