mmc: meson-gx: remove CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO clock flag

Remove CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO. This flag means that a 1 based divider
with a 0 value will behave as a bypass clock

The mmc divider does not behave like this, a 0 value disables the clock
Remove this flag so CCF never allows a 0 value on this clock
