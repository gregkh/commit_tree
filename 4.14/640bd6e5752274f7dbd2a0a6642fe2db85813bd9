KVM: SVM: Enable Virtual GIF feature

Enable the Virtual GIF feature. This is done by setting bit 25 at position
60h in the vmcb.

With this feature enabled, the processor uses bit 9 at position 60h as the
virtual GIF when executing STGI/CLGI instructions.

Since the execution of STGI by the L1 hypervisor does not cause a return to
the outermost (L0) hypervisor, the enable_irq_window and enable_nmi_window
are modified.

The IRQ window will be opened even if GIF is not set, under the assumption
that on resuming the L1 hypervisor the IRQ will be held pending until the
processor executes the STGI instruction.

For the NMI window, the STGI intercept is set. This will assist in opening
the window only when GIF=1.
