ALSA: seq: Enable 'use' locking in all configurations

The 'use' locking macros are no-ops if neither SMP or SND_DEBUG is
enabled.  This might once have been OK in non-preemptible
configurations, but even in that case snd_seq_read() may sleep while
relying on a 'use' lock.  So always use the proper implementations.
