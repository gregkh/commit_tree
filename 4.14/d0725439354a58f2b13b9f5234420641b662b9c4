hwmon: (tmp102) Fix first temperature reading

Commit 3d8f7a89a197 ("hwmon: (tmp102) Improve handling of initial read
delay") reduced the initial temperature read delay and made it dependent
on the chip's shutdown mode. If the chip was not in shutdown mode at probe,
the read delay no longer applies.

This ignores the fact that the chip initialization changes the temperature
sensor resolution, and that the temperature register values change when
the resolution is changed. As a result, the reported temperature is twice
as high as the real temperature until the first temperature conversion
after the configuration change is complete. This can result in unexpected
behavior and, worst case, in a system shutdown. To fix the problem,
let's just always wait for a conversion to complete before reporting
a temperature.
