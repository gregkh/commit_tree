media: docs-rst: cardlists: change their format to flat-tables

Most tables there don't fit on 80 columns. Some are very big.

While those tables are actually generated via scripts, every
time a new board is added, the entire table could be reformatted.
>From the diffstat PoV, that's bad, as it is hard to see what
happened.

One such example is at changeset 4868f6e1fce6 ("media:
em28xx-cardlist.rst: update to reflect last changes"):

The USB ID for "Plextor ConvertX PX-AV100U" was added to card
number 9, with caused the entire table to be reformatted.

So, instead, use flat-tables. While here, fix PDF output,
by adding tablecolumns to the tables that need it.
