perf record: Fix documentation for a inexistent option '-l'

'perf record' had a '-l' option that meant "scale counter values" a very
long time ago, but it currently belongs to 'perf stat' as '-c'.  So
remove it. I found this problem in the below case.

    $ perf record -e cycles -l sleep 3
      Error: unknown switch `l
