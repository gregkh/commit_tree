thermal: exynos: constify thermal_zone_of_device_ops structures

The thermal_zone_of_device_ops structure is only passed as the fourth
argument to thermal_zone_of_sensor_register, which is declared as const.
Thus the thermal_zone_of_device_ops structure itself can be const.

Done with the help of Coccinelle.
