mm: replace TIF_MEMDIE checks by tsk_is_oom_victim

TIF_MEMDIE is set only to the tasks whick were either directly selected
by the OOM killer or passed through mark_oom_victim from the allocator
path.  tsk_is_oom_victim is more generic and allows to identify all
tasks (threads) which share the mm with the oom victim.

Please note that the freezer still needs to check TIF_MEMDIE because we
cannot thaw tasks which do not participage in oom_victims counting
otherwise a !TIF_MEMDIE task could interfere after oom_disbale returns.
