clocksource/drivers/bcm2835: Remove message for a memory allocation failure

The bcm2835_timer_init() function emits an error message in case of a memory
allocation failure. This is pointless as the mm core does that already.

Remove this message.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
