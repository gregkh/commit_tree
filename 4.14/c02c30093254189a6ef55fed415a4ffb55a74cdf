mm/madvise.c: add description for MADV_WIPEONFORK and MADV_KEEPONFORK

mm/madvise.c has a brief description about all MADV_ flags.  Add a
description for the newly added MADV_WIPEONFORK and MADV_KEEPONFORK.

Although man page has the similar information, but it'd better to keep
the consistent with other flags.
