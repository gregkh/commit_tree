btrfs: Move skip checksum check from btrfs_submit_direct to __btrfs_submit_dio_bio

Currently the code checks whether we should do data checksumming in
btrfs_submit_direct and the boolean result of this check is passed to
btrfs_submit_direct_hook, in turn passing it to __btrfs_submit_dio_bio which
actually consumes it. The last function actually has all the necessary context
to figure out whether to skip the check or not, so let's move the check closer
to where it's being consumed. No functional changes.
