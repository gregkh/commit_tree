xfs: Add infrastructure needed for error propagation during buffer IO failure

With the current code, XFS never re-submit a failed buffer for IO,
because the failed item in the buffer is kept in the flush locked state
forever.

To be able to resubmit an log item for IO, we need a way to mark an item
as failed, if, for any reason the buffer which the item belonged to
failed during writeback.

Add a new log item callback to be used after an IO completion failure
and make the needed clean ups.
