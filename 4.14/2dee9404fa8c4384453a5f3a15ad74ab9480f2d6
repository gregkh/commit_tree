rcu: Add assertions verifying blocked-tasks list

This commit adds assertions verifying the consistency of the rcu_node
structure's ->blkd_tasks list and its ->gp_tasks, ->exp_tasks, and
->boost_tasks pointers.  In particular, the ->blkd_tasks lists must be
empty except for leaf rcu_node structures.
