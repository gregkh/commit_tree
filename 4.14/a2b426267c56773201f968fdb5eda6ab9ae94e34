userns,pidns: Verify the userns for new pid namespaces

It is pointless and confusing to allow a pid namespace hierarchy and
the user namespace hierarchy to get out of sync.  The owner of a child
pid namespace should be the owner of the parent pid namespace or
a descendant of the owner of the parent pid namespace.

Otherwise it is possible to construct scenarios where a process has a
capability over a parent pid namespace but does not have the
capability over a child pid namespace.  Which confusingly makes
permission checks non-transitive.

It requires use of setns into a pid namespace (but not into a user
namespace) to create such a scenario.

Add the function in_userns to help in making this determination.
