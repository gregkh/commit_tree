fs/epoll: use faster rb_first_cached()

...  such that we can avoid the tree walks to get the node with the
smallest key.  Semantically the same, as the previously used rb_first(),
but O(1).  The main overhead is the extra footprint for the cached rb_node
pointer, which should not matter for epoll.
