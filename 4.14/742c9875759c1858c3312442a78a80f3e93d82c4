i40e/i40evf: avoid dynamic ITR updates when polling or low packet rate

The dynamic ITR algorithm depends on a calculation of usecs which
assumes that the interrupts have been firing constantly at the interrupt
throttle rate. This is not guaranteed because we could have a low packet
rate, or have been polling in software.

We'll estimate whether this is the case by using jiffies to determine if
we've been too long. If the time difference of jiffies is larger we are
guaranteed to have an incorrect calculation. If the time difference of
jiffies is smaller we might have been polling some but the difference
shouldn't affect the calculation too much.

This ensures that we don't get stuck in BULK latency during certain rare
situations where we receive bursts of packets that force us into NAPI
polling.
