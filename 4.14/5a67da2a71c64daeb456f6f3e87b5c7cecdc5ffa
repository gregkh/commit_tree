bpf: add support for sockmap detach programs

The bpf map sockmap supports adding programs via attach commands. This
patch adds the detach command to keep the API symmetric and allow
users to remove previously added programs. Otherwise the user would
have to delete the map and re-add it to get in this state.

This also adds a series of additional tests to capture detach operation
and also attaching/detaching invalid prog types.

API note: socks will run (or not run) programs depending on the state
of the map at the time the sock is added. We do not for example walk
the map and remove programs from previously attached socks.
