sock: add MSG_ZEROCOPY

The kernel supports zerocopy sendmsg in virtio and tap. Expand the
infrastructure to support other socket types. Introduce a completion
notification channel over the socket error queue. Notifications are
returned with ee_origin SO_EE_ORIGIN_ZEROCOPY. ee_errno is 0 to avoid
blocking the send/recv path on receiving notifications.

Add reference counting, to support the skb split, merge, resize and
clone operations possible with SOCK_STREAM and other socket types.

The patch does not yet modify any datapaths.
