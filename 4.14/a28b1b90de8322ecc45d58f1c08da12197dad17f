skbuff: re-add check for NULL skb->head in kfree_skb path

A null check is needed after all.  netlink skbs can have skb->head be
backed by vmalloc.  The netlink destructor vfree()s head, then sets it to
NULL.  We then panic in skb_release_data with a NULL dereference.

Re-add such a test.

Alternative would be to switch to kvfree to free skb->head memory
and remove the special handling in netlink destructor.
