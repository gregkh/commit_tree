KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: Fix return value for device table restore

If ITT only contains invalid entries, vgic_its_restore_itt
returns 1 and this is considered as an an error in
vgic_its_restore_dte.

Also in case the device table only contains invalid entries,
the table restore fails and this is not correct.

This patch fixes those 2 issues:
- vgic_its_restore_itt now returns <= 0 values. If all
  ITEs are invalid, this is considered as successful.
- vgic_its_restore_device_tables also returns <= 0 values.

We also simplify the returned value computation in
handle_l1_dte.
