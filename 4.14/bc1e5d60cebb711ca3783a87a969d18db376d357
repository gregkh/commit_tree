perf annotate TUI: Clarify calculation of column header widths

In commit f8f4aaead579 ("perf annotate: Finally display IPC and cycle
accounting") the 'pcnt_width' variable was abused in a few places to
also include the optional width of the "IPC" and "cycles" columns, while
in other places we stopped using 'pcnt_width' and instead its previous
equation...

Now that we need to tap into annotate_browser__pcnt_width() to consider
if --show-total-period is being used and instead of that hardcoded 7
(strlen("Percent")) we need to use it or strlen("Event count") we need
this properly clarified to avoid having to touch all the (7 * nr_events)
places.

Clarify this by introducing a separate annotate_browser__cycles_width()
to leave the pcnt_width calculate just what its name implies.
