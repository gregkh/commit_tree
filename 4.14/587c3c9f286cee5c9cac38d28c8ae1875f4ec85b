scsi: sg: Re-fix off by one in sg_fill_request_table()

Commit 109bade9c625 ("scsi: sg: use standard lists for sg_requests")
introduced an off-by-one error in sg_ioctl(), which was fixed by commit
bd46fc406b30 ("scsi: sg: off by one in sg_ioctl()").

Unfortunately commit 4759df905a47 ("scsi: sg: factor out
sg_fill_request_table()") moved that code, and reintroduced the
bug (perhaps due to a botched rebase).  Fix it again.
