remoteproc/davinci: Add support to parse internal memories

The DSP subsystem on OMAP-L13x SoCs has various internal RAM
memories that can accessed from the ARM side. These memories
can be configured to be used as either RAM or Cache.

The Davinci remoteproc driver has been enhanced to parse and
store the kernel mappings for these internal RAM memories.
These mappings can then be used to support direct loading of
text/data into these memories from the remoteproc driver.
