media: usb: constify usb_device_id

usb_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with usb_device_id provided by <linux/usb.h> work with
const usb_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

'drivers/media/usb/b2c2/flexcop-usb.c' Fix checkpatch.pl error:
ERROR: space prohibited before open square bracket '['.
