checkpatch: fix ignoring cover-letter logic

Currently running checkpatch on a directory with a cover-letter.patch
file reports the following error:

  -----------------------------------------
  patches/smp-v2/v2-0000-cover-letter.patch
  -----------------------------------------

  ERROR: Does not appear to be a unified-diff format patch

The logic to suppress the unified-diff check for cover letters is there
but is checking $file instead of $filename.  Fix the variable to use the
correct one.
