samples/bpf: xdp_redirect load XDP dummy prog on TX device

For supporting XDP_REDIRECT, a device driver must (obviously)
implement the "TX" function ndo_xdp_xmit().  An additional requirement
is you cannot TX out a device, unless it also have a xdp bpf program
attached. This dependency is caused by the driver code need to setup
XDP resources before it can ndo_xdp_xmit.

Update bpf samples xdp_redirect and xdp_redirect_map to automatically
attach a dummy XDP program to the configured ifindex_out device.  Use
the XDP flag XDP_FLAGS_UPDATE_IF_NOEXIST on the dummy load, to avoid
overriding an existing XDP prog on the device.
