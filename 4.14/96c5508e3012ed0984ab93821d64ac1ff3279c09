xdp: implement xdp_redirect_map for generic XDP

Using bpf_redirect_map is allowed for generic XDP programs, but the
appropriate map lookup was never performed in xdp_do_generic_redirect().

Instead the map-index is directly used as the ifindex.  For the
xdp_redirect_map sample in SKB-mode '-S', this resulted in trying
sending on ifindex 0 which isn't valid, resulting in getting SKB
packets dropped.  Thus, the reported performance numbers are wrong in
commit 24251c264798 ("samples/bpf: add option for native and skb mode
for redirect apps") for the 'xdp_redirect_map -S' case.

Before commit 109980b894e9 ("bpf: don't select potentially stale
ri->map from buggy xdp progs") it could crash the kernel.  Like this
commit also check that the map_owner owner is correct before
dereferencing the map pointer.  But make sure that this API misusage
can be caught by a tracepoint. Thus, allowing userspace via
tracepoints to detect misbehaving bpf_progs.
