mm, THP, swap: support to reclaim swap space for THP swapped out

The normal swap slot reclaiming can be done when the swap count reaches
SWAP_HAS_CACHE.  But for the swap slot which is backing a THP, all swap
slots backing one THP must be reclaimed together, because the swap slot
may be used again when the THP is swapped out again later.  So the swap
slots backing one THP can be reclaimed together when the swap count for
all swap slots for the THP reached SWAP_HAS_CACHE.  In the patch, the
functions to check whether the swap count for all swap slots backing one
THP reached SWAP_HAS_CACHE are implemented and used when checking
whether a swap slot can be reclaimed.

To make it easier to determine whether a swap slot is backing a THP, a
new swap cluster flag named CLUSTER_FLAG_HUGE is added to mark a swap
cluster which is backing a THP (Transparent Huge Page).  Because THP
swap in as a whole isn't supported now.  After deleting the THP from the
swap cache (for example, swapping out finished), the CLUSTER_FLAG_HUGE
flag will be cleared.  So that, the normal pages inside THP can be
swapped in individually.
