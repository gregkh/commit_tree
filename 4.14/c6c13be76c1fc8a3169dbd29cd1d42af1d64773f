perf annotate: Do not overwrite perf_sample->weight

When we parse an event we may get a value from the kernel in response to
PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT being set in perf_event_attr->sample_type, and if it
is not set, then perf_sample->weight will be set to zero, which should
be ok according to a discussion with Andi Kleen [1]:
