drm/vc4: Fix double destroy of the BO cache on teardown.

It's also destroyed from the top level vc4_drv.c initialization, which
is where the cache was actually initialized from.

This used to just involve duplicate del_timer() and cancel_work_sync()
being called, but it started causing kmalloc issues once we
double-freed the new BO label array.
