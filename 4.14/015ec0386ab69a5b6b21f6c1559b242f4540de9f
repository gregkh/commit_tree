irqchip/gic-v3-its: Add VLPI configuration handling

When a VLPI is reconfigured (enabled, disabled, change in priority),
the full configuration byte must be written, and the caches invalidated.

Also, when using the irq_mask/irq_unmask methods, it is necessary
to disable the doorbell for that particular interrupt (by mapping it
to 1023) on top of clearing the Enable bit.
