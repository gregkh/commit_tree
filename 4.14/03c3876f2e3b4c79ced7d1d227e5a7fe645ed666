ACPI: SPCR: work around clock issue on xgene UART

xgene v1/v2 8250 UARTs don't run at the standard clock rate expected by
the driver and there is no information on clocking available from the
SPCR table. As there has been no progress on relevant vendors updating
DBG2/SPCR specifications to fix this work around this using the previous
xgene quirk handling to avoid setting a baud rate and therefore using
the UART as configured by firmware.
