media: staging: atomisp: ov2722: constify acpi_device_id

acpi_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with acpi_device_id provided by <acpi/acpi_bus.h> work with
const acpi_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  14771	   1880	      0	  16651	   410b drivers/staging/media/atomisp/i2c/ov2722.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  14835	   1816	      0	  16651	   410b drivers/staging/media/atomisp/i2c/ov2722.o
