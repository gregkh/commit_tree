IB/mlx5: Restore IB guid/policy for virtual functions

When a user sets port_guid, node_guid or policy of an IB virtual
function, save this information in "struct mlx5_vf_context".

This information will be restored later when pci_resume is called.
To make sure this works, one can use aer-inject to generate PCI
errors on mlx5 devices and verify if relevant fields are restored
after PCI resume.
