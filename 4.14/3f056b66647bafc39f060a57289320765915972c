perf jevents: Make build fail on JSON parse error

Today, when a JSON file fails parsing the build continues, but there are
no json files built in, which is difficult to debug later.  Make the
build stop on a parse error instead.

v2: Add fixes from Sukadev. Now we handle architectures
    with no JSON events correctly. And fix some stale comments.

Committer note:

Tested by running the cross build container tests, that were all failing
for v1.
