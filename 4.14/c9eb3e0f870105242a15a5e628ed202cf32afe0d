net: dsa: Add support for learning FDB through notification

Add support for learning FDB through notification. The driver defers
the hardware update via ordered work queue. In case of a successful
FDB add a notification is sent back to bridge.

In case of hw FDB del failure the static FDB will be deleted from
the bridge, thus, the interface is moved to down state in order to
indicate inconsistent situation.
