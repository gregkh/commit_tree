staging: irda: fix init level for irda core

When moving the IRDA code out of net/ into drivers/staging/irda/net, the
link order changes when IRDA is built into the kernel.  That causes a
kernel crash at boot time as netfilter isn't initialized yet.

To fix this, move the init call level of the irda core to be
device_initcall() as the link order keeps this being initialized at the
correct time.
