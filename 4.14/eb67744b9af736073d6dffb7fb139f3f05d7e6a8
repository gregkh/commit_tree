dmaengine: bcm-sba-raid: Alloc resources before registering DMA device

We should allocate DMA channel resources before registering the
DMA device in sba_probe() because we can get DMA request soon
after registering the DMA device. If DMA channel resources are
not allocated before first DMA request then SBA-RAID driver will
crash.
