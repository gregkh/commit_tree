PCI: faraday: Fix of_irq_get() error check

of_irq_get() may return a negative error number as well as 0 on failure,
while the driver only checks for 0, blithely continuing with the call to
irq_set_chained_handler_and_data() -- that function expects *unsigned int*
so should probably do nothing when a large IRQ number resulting from a
conversion of a negative error number is passed to it. The driver then
probes successfully while being only partly functional...

Check for 'irq <= 0' instead and propagate the negative error number to the
probe method --  that will allow the deferred probing as well.
