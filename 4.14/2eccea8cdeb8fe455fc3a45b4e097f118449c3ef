ASoC: soc-core: snd_soc_unregister_component() unregister all component

Current snd_soc_unregister_component() unregisters first found
component only which was specified by dev.
This style can't specify concrete component if system registered some
component with same dev. And system need to call this function many
times.
This patch unregister all related component by 1 call.
