ipv6: fib_rules: Dump rules during registration to FIB chain

Allow users of the FIB notification chain to receive a complete view of
the IPv6 FIB rules upon registration to the chain.

The integrity of the dump is ensured by a per-family sequence counter
that is incremented (under RTNL) whenever a rule is added or deleted.

All the sequence counters are read (under RTNL) and summed, prior and
after the dump. In case the counters differ, then the dump is either
restarted or the registration fails.
