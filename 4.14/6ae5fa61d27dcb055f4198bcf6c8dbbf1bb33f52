perf/x86: Fix data source decoding for Skylake

Skylake changed the encoding of the PEBS data source field.
Some combinations are not available anymore, but some new cases
e.g. for L4 cache hit are added.

Fix up the conversion table for Skylake, similar as had been done
for Nehalem.

On Skylake server the encoding for L4 actually means persistent
memory. Handle this case too.

To properly describe it in the abstracted perf format I had to add
some new fields. Since a hit can have only one level add a new
field that is an enumeration, not a bit field to describe
the level. It can describe any level. Some numbers are also
used to describe PMEM and LFB.

Also add a new generic remote flag that can be combined with
the generic level to signify a remote cache.

And there is an extension field for the snoop indication to handle
the Forward state.

I didn't add a generic flag for hops because it's not needed
for Skylake.

I changed the existing encodings for older CPUs to also fill in the
new level and remote fields.
