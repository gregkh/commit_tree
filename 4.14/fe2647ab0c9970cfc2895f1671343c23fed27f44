i40evf: prevent VF close returning before state transitions to DOWN

Currently i40evf_close() can return before state transitions to
__I40EVF_DOWN because of the latency involved in processing and
receiving response from PF driver and scheduling of VF watchdog_task.
Due to this inconsistency an immediate call to i40evf_open() fails
because state is still DOWN_PENDING.

When a VF interface is in up state and we try to add it as slave,
The bonding driver calls dev_close() and dev_open() in short duration
resulting in dev_open returning error. The ifenslave command needs
to be run again for dev_open to succeed.

This fix ensures that watchdog timer is scheduled immediately after
admin queue operations are scheduled in i40evf_down(). In addition a
wait condition is added at the end of i40evf_close so that function
wont return when state is still DOWN_PENDING. The timeout value is
chosen after some profiling and includes some buffer.
