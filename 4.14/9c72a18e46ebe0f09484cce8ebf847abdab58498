md/raid5: release/flush io in raid5_do_work()

In raid5, there are scenarios where some ios are deferred to a later
time, and some IO need a flush to complete. To make sure we make
progress with these IOs, we need to call the following functions:

    flush_deferred_bios(conf);
    r5l_flush_stripe_to_raid(conf->log);

Both of these functions are called in raid5d(), but missing in
raid5_do_work(). As a result, these functions are not called
when multi-threading (group_thread_cnt > 0) is enabled. This patch
adds calls to these function to raid5_do_work().

Note for stable branches:

  r5l_flush_stripe_to_raid(conf->log) is need for 4.4+
  flush_deferred_bios(conf) is only needed for 4.11+
