rtnetlink: switch rtnl_link_get_slave_info_data_size to rcu

David Ahern reports following splat:
 RTNL: assertion failed at net/core/dev.c (5717)
 netdev_master_upper_dev_get+0x5f/0x70
 if_nlmsg_size+0x158/0x240
 rtnl_calcit.isra.26+0xa3/0xf0

rtnl_link_get_slave_info_data_size currently assumes RTNL protection, but
there appears to be no hard requirement for this, so use rcu instead.

At the time of this writing, there are three 'get_slave_size' callbacks
(now invoked under rcu): bond_get_slave_size, vrf_get_slave_size and
br_port_get_slave_size, all return constant only (i.e. they don't sleep).
