net_sched/hfsc: fix curve activation in hfsc_change_class()

If real-time or fair-share curves are enabled in hfsc_change_class()
class isn't inserted into rb-trees yet. Thus init_ed() and init_vf()
must be called in place of update_ed() and update_vf().

Remove isn't required because for now curves cannot be disabled.
