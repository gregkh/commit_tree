coresight tmc: Handle configuration types properly

Coresight SoC 600 defines a new configuration for TMC, Embedded Trace
Streamer (ETS), indicated by 0x3 in MODE:CONFIG_TYPE. This would break
the existing driver which will treat anything other than ETR/ETB as an
ETF. Fix the driver to check the configuration type properly and also
add a warning if we encounter an unsupported configuration (ETS).
