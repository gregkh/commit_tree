s390/qeth: remove extra L2 adapterparms query

qeth_l2_request_initial_mac() queries the device for its supported
adapterparms, even though they already have been queried as part of the
device's high-level setup. Remove that extra call.

The only call chain for qeth_l2_request_initial_mac() is
__qeth_l2_set_online()
	qeth_core_hardsetup_card()
		qeth_query_setadapterparms()
	qeth_l2_setup_netdev()
		qeth_l2_request_initial_mac()
			qeth_query_setadapterparms()

, and we only reach qeth_l2_request_initial_mac() if the first
adapterparms query succeeds. Hence removing the second query results in
no loss of functionality.
