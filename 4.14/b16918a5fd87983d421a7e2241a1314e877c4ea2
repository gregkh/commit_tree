hwmon: (da9052) Increase sample rate when using TSI

The TSI channel, which is usually used for touchscreen support, but can
be used as 4 general purpose ADCs. When used as a touchscreen interface
the touchscreen driver switches the device into 1ms sampling mode (rather
than the default 10ms economy mode) as recommended by the manufacturer.
When using the TSI channels as a general purpose ADC we are currently not
doing this and testing suggests that this can result in ADC timeouts:

[ 5827.198289] da9052 spi2.0: timeout waiting for ADC conversion interrupt
[ 5827.728293] da9052 spi2.0: timeout waiting for ADC conversion interrupt
[ 5993.808335] da9052 spi2.0: timeout waiting for ADC conversion interrupt
[ 5994.328441] da9052 spi2.0: timeout waiting for ADC conversion interrupt
[ 5994.848291] da9052 spi2.0: timeout waiting for ADC conversion interrupt

Switching to the 1ms timing resolves this issue.
