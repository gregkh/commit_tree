dm integrity: do not check integrity for failed read operations

Even though read operations fail, dm_integrity_map_continue() calls
integrity_metadata() to check integrity.  In this case, just complete
these.

This also makes it so read I/O errors do not generate integrity warnings
in the kernel log.
