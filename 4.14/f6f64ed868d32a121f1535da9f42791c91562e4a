clk: sunxi-ng: Add interface to query or configure MMC timing modes.

Starting with the A83T SoC, Allwinner introduced a new timing mode for
its MMC clocks. The new mode changes how the MMC controller sample and
output clocks are delayed to match chip and board specifics. There are
two controls for this, one on the CCU side controlling how the clocks
behave, and one in the MMC controller controlling what inputs to take
and how to route them.

In the old mode, the MMC clock had 2 child clocks providing the output
and sample clocks, which could be delayed by a number of clock cycles
measured from the MMC clock's parent.

With the new mode, the 2 delay clocks are no longer active. Instead,
the delays and associated controls are moved into the MMC controller.
The output of the MMC clock is also halved.

The difference in how things are wired between the modes means that the
clock controls and the MMC controls must match. To achieve this in a
clear, explicit way, we introduce two functions for the MMC driver to
use: one queries the hardware for the current mode set, and the other
allows the MMC driver to request a mode.
