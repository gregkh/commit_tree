drm/vblank: Unexport drm_vblank_cleanup

There's no reason for drivers to call this, and all the ones I've
removed looked very fishy:
- Proper quiescenting of the vblank machinery should be done by
  calling drm_crtc_vblank_off(), which is best done by shutting down
  the entire display engine with drm_atomic_helper_shutdown.

- Releasing of allocated memory is done by the core already, it calls
  drm_vblank_cleanup as a fallback.

- drm_vblank_cleanup also has checks for drivers which forget to clean
  up vblank interrupts.

This essentially reverts

    drm: Avoid calling vblank function is vblank wasn't initialized

which was done to fix a bug in radeon code with msi interrupts:

    drm/radeon/kms: Don't try to enable IRQ if we have no handler installed

Afaict from digging around in old code, this was needed to avoid
blowing up in the ums fallback, and has stopped serving it's purpose
long ago - if irq init fails, the driver fails to load, and there's
really no way to blow up anymore.

Long story short, this was most likely a small ums compat/fallback
hack that became a thing of it's own and got cargo-cult duplicated all
over the drm codebase for essentially no gain at all.

v2: Mention that for drivers with a ->release callback cleanup is
handled by drm_dev_fini() (Thierry).
