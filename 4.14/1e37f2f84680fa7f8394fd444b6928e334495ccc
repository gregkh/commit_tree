rbd: use GFP_NOIO for parent stat and data requests

rbd_img_obj_exists_submit() and rbd_img_obj_parent_read_full() are on
the writeback path for cloned images -- we attempt a stat on the parent
object to see if it exists and potentially read it in to call copyup.
GFP_NOIO should be used instead of GFP_KERNEL here.
