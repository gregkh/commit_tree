fscache: remove unused ->now_uncached callback

Patch series "Ranged pagevec lookup", v2.

In this series I make pagevec_lookup() update the index (to be
consistent with pagevec_lookup_tag() and also as a preparation for
ranged lookups), provide ranged variant of pagevec_lookup() and use it
in places where it makes sense.  This not only removes some common code
but is also a measurable performance win for some use cases (see patch
4/10) where radix tree is sparse and searching & grabing of a page after
the end of the range has measurable overhead.

This patch (of 10):

The callback doesn't ever get called.  Remove it.
