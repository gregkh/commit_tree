nios2: time: Read timer in get_cycles only if initialized

Mainline crashes as follows when running nios2 images.

On node 0 totalpages: 65536
free_area_init_node: node 0, pgdat c8408fa0, node_mem_map c8726000
  Normal zone: 512 pages used for memmap
  Normal zone: 0 pages reserved
  Normal zone: 65536 pages, LIFO batch:15
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
ea = c8003cb0, ra = c81cbf40, cause = 15
Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops

Problem is seen because get_cycles() is called before the timer it depends
on is initialized. Returning 0 in that situation fixes the problem.
