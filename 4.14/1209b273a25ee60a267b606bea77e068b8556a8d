perf test: Add infrastructure to run shell based tests

To allow testing by directly using perf tools in scripts, checking that
the effects on the system are the ones expected and that the output
produced is as well the desired one.

For instance, adding a probe at a well known location with 'perf probe',
then checking that the results from using that probe to record are the
desired ones, etc.

The next csets will introduce tests using this new testing
infrastructure.

The scripts should return 0 for Ok, 1 for FAIL and 2 for SKIP.
