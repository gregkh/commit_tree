After running some memory intensive workload in guest, I catch the kworker
which completes the GUP too quickly, and queues an "Page Ready" #PF exception
after the "Page not Present" exception before the next vmentry as the above
trace which will result in #DF injected to guest.

This patch fixes it by clearing the queue for "Page not Present" if "Page Ready"
occurs before the next vmentry since the GUP has already got the required page
and shadow page table has already been fixed by "Page Ready" handler.
