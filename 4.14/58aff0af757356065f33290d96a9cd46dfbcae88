ipc/shm: Fix order of parameters when calling copy_compat_shmid_to_user

Commit 553f770ef71b ("ipc: move compat shmctl to native") moved the
compat IPC syscall handling into ipc/shm.c and refactored the struct
accessors in the process. Unfortunately, the call to
copy_compat_shmid_to_user when handling a compat {IPC,SHM}_STAT command
gets the arguments the wrong way round, passing a kernel stack address
as the user buffer (destination) and the user buffer as the kernel stack
address (source).

This patch fixes the parameter ordering so the buffers are accessed
correctly.
