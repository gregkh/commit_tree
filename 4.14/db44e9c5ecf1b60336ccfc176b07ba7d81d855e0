arm64: Add ASM_BUG()

Currently. we can only use BUG() from C code, though there are
situations where we would like an equivalent mechanism in assembly code.

This patch refactors our BUG() definition such that it can be used in
either C or assembly, in the form of a new ASM_BUG().

The refactoring requires the removal of escape sequences, such as '\n'
and '\t', but these aren't strictly necessary as we can use ';' to
terminate assembler statements.

The low-level assembly is factored out into <asm/asm-bug.h>, with
<asm/bug.h> retained as the C wrapper.
