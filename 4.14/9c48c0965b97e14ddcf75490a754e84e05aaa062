x86/idt: Initialize early IDT before cr4_init_shadow()

Moving the early IDT setup out of assembly code breaks the boot on first
generation 486 systems.

The reason is that the call of idt_setup_early_handler, which sets up the
early handlers was added after the call to cr4_init_shadow().

cr4_init_shadow() tries to read CR4 which is not available on those
systems. The accessor function uses a extable fixup to handle the resulting
fault. As the IDT is not set up yet, the cr4 read exception causes an
instantaneous reboot for obvious reasons.

Call idt_setup_early_handler() before cr4_init_shadow() so IDT is set up
before the first exception hits.
