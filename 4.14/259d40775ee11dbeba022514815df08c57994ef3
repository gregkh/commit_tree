tools include linux: Guard against redefinition of some macros

When cross building to android r15c (and older versions) on Fedora 26
we notice these:

/opt/android-ndk-r15c/platforms/android-24/arch-arm/usr/include/sys/cdefs.h:332:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition

For __aligned, __packed and __noreturn, so guard those with ifdefs to
avoid drowning useful warnings in these.
