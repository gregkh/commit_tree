staging: pi433: Make functions rf69_set_bandwidth_intern static

The function rf69_set_bandwidth_intern is local to the source
and do not need to be in global scope, so make it static. Also
break overly wide line.

Cleans up sparse warning:
symbol 'update_share_count' was not declared. Should it be static?
