powerpc: Fix powerpc-specific watchdog build configuration

The powerpc kernel/watchdog.o should be built when HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR
and HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH are both selected. If only the former
is selected, then the generic perf watchdog has been selected.

To simplify this check, introduce a new Kconfig symbol PPC_WATCHDOG that
depends on both. This Kconfig option means the powerpc specific
watchdog is enabled.

Without this patch, Book3E will attempt to build the powerpc watchdog.
