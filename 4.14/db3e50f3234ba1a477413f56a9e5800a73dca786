device property: Get rid of struct fwnode_handle type field

Instead of relying on the struct fwnode_handle type field, define
fwnode_operations structs for all separate types of fwnodes. To find out
the type, compare to the ops field to relevant ops structs.

This change has two benefits:

1. it avoids adding the type field to each and every instance of struct
fwnode_handle, thus saving memory and

2. makes the ops field the single factor that defines both the types of
the fwnode as well as defines the implementation of its operations,
decreasing the possibility of bugs when developing code dealing with
fwnode internals.
