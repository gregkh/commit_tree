drm/core: Fail atomic IOCTL with no CRTC state but with signaling.

Problem : While running IGT kms_atomic_transition test suite i encountered
a hang in drmHandleEvent immediately following  an atomic_commit.
After dumping the atomic state I relized that in this case there was
not even one CRTC attached to the state and only disabled
planes. This probably due to a commit which hadn't changed any property
which would require attaching crtc state. This means drmHandleEvent
will never wake up from read since without CRTC in atomic state
the event fd will not be signaled.

Fix: Protect against this issue by failing atomic_commit early in
drm_mode_atomic_commit where such probelm can be identified.

v2:
Fix typos and extra newlines.
