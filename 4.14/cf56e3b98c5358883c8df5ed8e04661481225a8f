bpf: sockmap state change warning fix

psock will uninitialized in default case we need to do the same psock lookup
and check as in other branch. Fixes compile warning below.

kernel/bpf/sockmap.c: In function ‘smap_state_change’:
kernel/bpf/sockmap.c:156:21: warning: ‘psock’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  struct smap_psock *psock;
