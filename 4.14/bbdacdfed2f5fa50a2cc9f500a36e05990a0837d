sched/debug: Optimize sched_domain sysctl generation

Currently we unconditionally destroy all sysctl bits and regenerate
them after we've rebuild the domains (even if that rebuild is a
no-op).

And since we unconditionally (re)build the sysctl for all possible
CPUs, onlining all CPUs gets us O(n^2) time. Instead change this to
only rebuild the bits for CPUs we've actually installed new domains
on.
