perf/bpf: fix a clang compilation issue

clang does not support variable length array for structure member.
It has the following error during compilation:

kernel/trace/trace_syscalls.c:568:17: error: fields must have a constant size:
'variable length array in structure' extension will never be supported
                unsigned long args[sys_data->nb_args];
                              ^

The fix is to use a fixed array length instead.
