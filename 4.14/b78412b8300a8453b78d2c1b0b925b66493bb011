sh: sh7722: remove nonexistent GPIO_PTQ7 to fix pinctrl registration

Patch series "sh: sh7722/sh7757i/sh7264/sh7269: Fix pinctrl registration",
v2.

Magnus Damm reported that on sh7722/Migo-R, pinctrl registration fails
with:

    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: pin 0 already registered
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: error during pin registration
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: could not register: -22
    sh-pfc: probe of pfc-sh7722 failed with error -22

pinmux_pins[] is initialized through PINMUX_GPIO(), using designated
array initializers, where the GPIO_* enums serve as indices.  Apparently
GPIO_PTQ7 was defined in the enum, but never used.  If enum values are
defined, but never used, pinmux_pins[] contains (zero-filled) holes.
Hence such entries are treated as pin zero, which was registered before,
and pinctrl registration fails.

I can't see how this ever worked, as at the time of commit f5e25ae52fef
("sh-pfc: Add sh7722 pinmux support"), pinmux_gpios[] in
drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/pfc-sh7722.c already had the hole, and
drivers/pinctrl/core.c already had the check.

Some scripting revealed a few more broken drivers:
  - sh7757 has four holes, due to nonexistent GPIO_PT[JLNQ]7_RESV.
  - sh7264 and sh7269 define GPIO_PH[0-7], but don't use it with
    PINMUX_GPIO().

Patch 1 fixes the issue on sh7722, and was tested.  Patches 3-4 should
fix the issue on the other 3 SoCs, but was untested due to lack of
hardware.

This patch (of 4):

On sh7722/Migo-R, pinctrl registration fails with:

    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: pin 0 already registered
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: error during pin registration
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: could not register: -22
    sh-pfc: probe of pfc-sh7722 failed with error -22

pinmux_pins[] is initialized through PINMUX_GPIO(), using designated array
initializers, where the GPIO_* enums serve as indices.  As GPIO_PTQ7 is
defined in the enum, but never used, pinmux_pins[] contains a
(zero-filled) hole.  Hence this entry is treated as pin zero, which was
registered before, and pinctrl registration fails.

According to the datasheet, port PTQ7 does not exist.  Hence remove
GPIO_PTQ7 from the enum to fix this.
