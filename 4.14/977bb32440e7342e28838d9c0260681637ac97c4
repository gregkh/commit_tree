net/smc: serialize connection creation in all cases

If a link group for a new server connection exists already, the mutex
serializing the determination of link groups is given up early.
The coming registration of memory regions benefits from the serialization
as well, if the mutex is held till connection creation is finished.
This patch postpones the unlocking of the link group creation mutex.
