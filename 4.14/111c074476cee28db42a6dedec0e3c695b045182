arm64: dts: salvator-common: Remove extra LVDS port label

The DU LVDS output is on port 3 on R8A7795 but on port 2 on R8A7796. The
lvds_connector label thus can't be defined in salvator-common.dtsi,
common to the two SoCs.

The lvds_connector label is meant for convenience to be referenced from
panel device tree files, such as r8a77xx-aa104xd12-panel.dtsi or
r8a77xx-aa121td01-panel.dtsi.  As those files are not included in any
device tree source, and the label never used elsewhere, we can simply
remove it. Out-of-tree patches that include panel device tree files can
then add a

	#define lvds_connector du_out_lvds0

before including the panel device tree file.
