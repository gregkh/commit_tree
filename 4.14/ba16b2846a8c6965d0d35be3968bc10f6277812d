kernfs: add an API to get kernfs node from inode number

Add an API to get kernfs node from inode number. We will need this to
implement exportfs operations.

This API will be used in blktrace too later, so it should be as fast as
possible. To make the API lock free, kernfs node is freed in RCU
context. And we depend on kernfs_node count/ino number to filter out
stale kernfs nodes.
