perf: xgene: Remove unnecessary managed resources cleanup

Managed resources in the driver should be automatically cleaned up on
driver detach. It's unnecessary to manually free/unmmap these resources.
One of the manual cleanup causes static checkers to complain.

This patch gets rid of all the unnecessary manual cleanup and properly
unregister all the registered PMU devices by the driver on driver detach.
