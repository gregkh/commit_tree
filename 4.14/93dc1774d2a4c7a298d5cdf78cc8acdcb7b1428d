auxdisplay: charlcd: properly restore atomic counter on error path

Commit f4757af ("staging: panel: Fix single-open policy race condition")
introduced in 3.19-rc1 attempted to fix a race condition on the open, but
failed to properly do it and used to exit without restoring the semaphore.

This results in -EBUSY being returned after the first open error until
the module is reloaded or the system restarted (ie: consecutive to a
dual open resulting in -EBUSY or to a permission error).

[ Note for stable maintainers: the code moved from drivers/misc/panel.c
  to drivers/auxdisplay/{charlcd,panel}.c during 4.12. The patch easily
  applies there (modulo the renamed atomic counter) but I can provide a
  tested backport if desired. ]
