mm, hugetlb, soft_offline: save compound page order before page migration

This fixes a bug in madvise() where if you'd try to soft offline a
hugepage via madvise(), while walking the address range you'd end up,
using the wrong page offset due to attempting to get the compound order
of a former but presently not compound page, due to dissolving the huge
page (since commit c3114a84f7f9: "mm: hugetlb: soft-offline: dissolve
source hugepage after successful migration").

As a result I ended up with all my free pages except one being offlined.
