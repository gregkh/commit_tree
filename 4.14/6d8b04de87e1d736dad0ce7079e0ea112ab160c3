ALSA: cs423x: fix format string overflow warning

The snd_pcm name may overflow the card->longname total size:

sound/isa/cs423x/cs4231.c: In function 'snd_cs4231_probe':
sound/isa/cs423x/cs4231.c:115:26: error: ' at 0x' directive writing 6 bytes into a region of size between 1 and 80 [-Werror=format-overflow=] 0x%lx, irq %d, dma %d",
  sprintf(card->longname, "%s at 0x%lx, irq %d, dma %d",
                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This changes the driver to use snprintf() so we truncate the string
instead of overflowing into the next field if that happens.

I decided to split out the second format string for the extra
DMA channel to keep the code simpler.
