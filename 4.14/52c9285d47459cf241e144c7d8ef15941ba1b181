PCI: endpoint: Add support for configurable page size

pci-epc-mem uses a page size equal to *PAGE_SIZE* (usually 4KB) to manage
the address space. However certain platforms like TI's K2G have a
restriction that this address space should be either divided into
1MB/2MB/4MB or 8MB sizes (Ref: 11.14.4.9.1 Outbound Address Translation in
K2G TRM SPRUHY8F January 2016 â€“ Revised May 2017).  Add support to handle
different page sizes here.
