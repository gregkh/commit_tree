i2c: use dev_get_drvdata() to get private data in suspend/resume hooks

Several drivers call to_platform_device() to get platform_device
and pass it to platform_get_drvdata().  In platform_get_drvdata(),
the platform_device is converted back to struct device again.

Use dev_get_drvdata() to avoid platform_device/device dance.
