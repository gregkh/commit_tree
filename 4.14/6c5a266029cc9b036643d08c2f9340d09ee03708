ALSA: hda: constify pci_device_id.

pci_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with pci_device_id provided by <linux/pci.h> work with
const pci_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   2610	    304	      8	   2922	    b6a	sound/hda/hdac_i915.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   2674	    240	      8	   2922	    b6a	sound/hda/hdac_i915.o
