x86/intel_rdt: Simplify info and base file lists

The info directory files and base files need to be different for each
resource like cache and Memory bandwidth. With in each resource, the
files would be further different for monitoring and ctrl. This leads to
a lot of different static array declarations given that we are adding
resctrl monitoring.

Simplify this to one common list of files and then declare a set of
flags to choose the files based on the resource, whether it is info or
base and if it is control type file. This is as a preparation to include
monitoring based info and base files.

No functional change.

[Vikas: Extended the flags to have few bits per category like resource,
	info/base etc]
