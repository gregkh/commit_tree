x86/smpboot: Make optimization of delay calibration work correctly

If the TSC has constant frequency then the delay calibration can be skipped
when it has been calibrated for a package already. This is checked in
calibrate_delay_is_known(), but that function is buggy in two aspects:

It returns 'false' if

  (!tsc_disabled && !cpu_has(&cpu_data(cpu), X86_FEATURE_CONSTANT_TSC)

which is obviously the reverse of the intended check and the check for the
sibling mask cannot work either because the topology links have not been
set up yet.

Correct the condition and move the call to set_cpu_sibling_map() before
invoking calibrate_delay() so the sibling check works correctly.
