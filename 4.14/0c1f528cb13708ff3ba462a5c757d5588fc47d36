drm: handle HDMI 2.0 VICs in AVI info-frames

HDMI 1.4b support the CEA video modes as per range of CEA-861-D (VIC 1-64).
For any other mode, the VIC filed in AVI infoframes should be 0.
HDMI 2.0 sinks, support video modes range as per CEA-861-F spec, which is
extended to (VIC 1-107).

This patch adds a bool input variable, which indicates if the connected
sink is a HDMI 2.0 sink or not. This will make sure that we don't pass a
HDMI 2.0 VIC to a HDMI 1.4 sink.

This patch touches all drm drivers, who are callers of this function
drm_hdmi_avi_infoframe_from_display_mode but to make sure there is
no change in current behavior, is_hdmi2 is kept as false.

In case of I915 driver, this patch:
- checks if the connected display is HDMI 2.0.
- HDMI infoframes carry one of this two type of information:
	- VIC for 4K modes for HDMI 1.4 sinks
	- S3D information for S3D modes
  As CEA-861-F has already defined VICs for 4K videomodes, this
  patch doesn't allow sending HDMI infoframes for HDMI 2.0 sinks,
  until the mode is 3D.

already above 80 char, so checkpatch gives 80 char warning again.
