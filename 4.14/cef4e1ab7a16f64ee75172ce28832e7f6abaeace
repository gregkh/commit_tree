scsi: hisi_sas: remove repeated device config in v2 hw

This patch removes some repeated configurations:

(1) The device id of the device is already set in the alloc function, so
    we don't need to modify in free device function.

(2) Field dev_type and dev_status are configured in hisi_sas_dev_gone(),
    so there is no need for repeated config in free_device_v3_hw.
