powerpc/mm/book3s64: Make KERN_IO_START a variable

Currently KERN_IO_START is defined as:

 #define KERN_IO_START  (KERN_VIRT_START + (KERN_VIRT_SIZE >> 1))

Although it looks like a constant, both the components are actually
variables, to allow us to have a different value between Radix and
Hash with a single kernel.

However that still requires both Radix and Hash to place the kernel IO
region at the same location relative to the start and end of the
kernel virtual region (namely 1/2 way through it), and we'd like to
change that.

So split KERN_IO_START out into its own variable, and initialise it
for Radix and Hash. In the medium term we should be able to
reconsolidate this, by doing a more involved rearrangement of the
location of the regions.
