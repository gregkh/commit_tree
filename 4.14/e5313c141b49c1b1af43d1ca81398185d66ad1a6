loop: remove union of use_aio and ref in struct loop_cmd

When the request is completed, lo_complete_rq() checks cmd->use_aio.
However, if this is in fact an aio request, cmd->use_aio will have
already been reused as cmd->ref by lo_rw_aio*. Fix it by not using a
union. On x86_64, there's a hole after the union anyways, so this
doesn't make struct loop_cmd any bigger.
