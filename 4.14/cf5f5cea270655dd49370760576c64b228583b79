bpf: add support for sys_enter_* and sys_exit_* tracepoints

Currently, bpf programs cannot be attached to sys_enter_* and sys_exit_*
style tracepoints. The iovisor/bcc issue #748
(https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/748) documents this issue.
For example, if you try to attach a bpf program to tracepoints
syscalls/sys_enter_newfstat, you will get the following error:
   # ./tools/trace.py t:syscalls:sys_enter_newfstat
   Ioctl(PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_BPF): Invalid argument
   Failed to attach BPF to tracepoint

The main reason is that syscalls/sys_enter_* and syscalls/sys_exit_*
tracepoints are treated differently from other tracepoints and there
is no bpf hook to it.

This patch adds bpf support for these syscalls tracepoints by
  . permitting bpf attachment in ioctl PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_BPF
  . calling bpf programs in perf_syscall_enter and perf_syscall_exit

The legality of bpf program ctx access is also checked.
Function trace_event_get_offsets returns correct max offset for each
specific syscall tracepoint, which is compared against the maximum offset
access in bpf program.
