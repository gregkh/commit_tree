btrfs: separate defrag and property compression

Add new value for compression to distinguish between defrag and
property. Previously, a single variable was used and this caused clashes
when the per-file 'compression' was set and a defrag -c was called.

The property-compression is loaded when the file is open, defrag will
overwrite the same variable and reset to 0 (ie. NONE) at when the file
defragmentaion is finished. That's considered a usability bug.

Now we won't touch the property value, use the defrag-compression. The
precedence of defrag is higher than for property (and whole-filesystem).
