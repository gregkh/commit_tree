s390/mm: prevent memory offline for memory blocks with cma areas

Memory blocks that contain areas for the contiguous memory allocator
(cma) should not be allowed to go offline. Otherwise this would render
cma completely useless.
This might make sense on other architectures where memory might be
taken offline due to hardware errors, but not on architectures which
support memory hotplug for load balancing.
