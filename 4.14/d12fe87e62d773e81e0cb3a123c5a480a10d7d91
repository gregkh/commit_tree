signal/testing: Don't look for __SI_FAULT in userspace

Fix the debug print statements in these tests where they reference
si_codes and in particular __SI_FAULT.  __SI_FAULT is a kernel
internal value and should never be seen by userspace.

While I am in there also fix si_code_str.  si_codes are an enumeration
there are not a bitmap so == and not & is the apropriate operation to
test for an si_code.
