PCI: layerscape: Move generic init functions earlier in file

We will use the generic ls_pcie_link_up() and ls_pcie_host_init() from
device-specific routines.  Move the generic functions earlier in the file
so we won't need forward declarations.  This is strictly a code move with
no functional change intended.
