x86/mm: Fix ELF_ET_DYN_BASE for 5-level paging

On machines with 5-level paging we don't want to allocate mapping above
47-bit unless user explicitly asked for it. See b569bab78d8d ("x86/mm:
Prepare to expose larger address space to userspace") for details.

c715b72c1ba4 ("mm: revert x86_64 and arm64 ELF_ET_DYN_BASE base
changes") broke the behaviour. After the commit elf binary and heap got
mapped above 47-bits.

Use DEFAULT_MAP_WINDOW instead of TASK_SIZE to determine ELF_ET_DYN_BASE so
it's forced to be below 47-bits unconditionally.
