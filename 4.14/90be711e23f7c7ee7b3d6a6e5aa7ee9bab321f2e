ASoC: use snd_soc_rtdcom_add() and convert to consistent operation

Basically, current ALSA SoC framework is based on CPU/Codec/Platform,
but its operation doesn't have consistent.
Thus, source code was unreadable, and difficult to understand.
This patch connects each component (= CPU/Codec/Platform) to rtd by
using snd_soc_rtdcom_add(), and convert uneven operations to consistent
operation.
