RDMA/netlink: Remove netlink clients infrastructure

RDMA netlink has a complicated infrastructure for dynamically
registering and de-registering netlink clients to the NETLINK_RDMA
group. The complicated portion of this code is not widely used because
2 of the 3 current clients are statically compiled together with
netlink.c. The infrastructure, therefore, is deemed overkill.

Refactor the code to eliminate the dynamically added clients. Now all
clients are pre-registered in a client array at compile time, and at run
time they merely check-in with the infrastructure to pass their callback
table for inclusion in the pre-sized client array.

This also allows for future cleanups and removal of unneeded code in the
iwcm* netlink handler.
