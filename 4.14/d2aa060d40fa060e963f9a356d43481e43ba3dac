net/mlx5: Cancel health poll before sending panic teardown command

After the panic teardown firmware command, health_care detects the error
in PCI bus and calls the mlx5_pci_err_detected. This health_care flow is
no longer needed because the panic teardown firmware command will bring
down the PCI bus communication with the HCA.

The solution is to cancel the health care timer and its pending
workqueue request before sending panic teardown firmware command.
