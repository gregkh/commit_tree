net: vrf: avoid gcc-4.6 warning

When building an allmodconfig kernel with gcc-4.6, we get a rather
odd warning:

drivers/net/vrf.c: In function ‘vrf_ip6_input_dst’:
drivers/net/vrf.c:964:3: error: initialized field with side-effects overwritten [-Werror]
drivers/net/vrf.c:964:3: error: (near initialization for ‘fl6’) [-Werror]

I have no idea what this warning is even trying to say, but it does
seem like a false positive. Reordering the initialization in to match
the structure definition gets rid of the warning, and might also avoid
whatever gcc thinks is wrong here.
