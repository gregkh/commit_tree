locking/lockdep: Add a comment about crossrelease_hist_end() in lockdep_sys_exit()

In lockdep_sys_exit(), crossrelease_hist_end() is called unconditionally
even when getting here without having started e.g. just after forking.

But it's no problem since it would roll back to an invalid entry anyway.
Add a comment to explain this.
