watchdog/core, powerpc: Replace watchdog_nmi_reconfigure()

The recent cleanup of the watchdog code split watchdog_nmi_reconfigure()
into two stages. One to stop the NMI and one to restart it after
reconfiguration. That was done by adding a boolean 'run' argument to the
code, which is functionally correct but not necessarily a piece of art.

Replace it by two explicit functions: watchdog_nmi_stop() and
watchdog_nmi_start().
