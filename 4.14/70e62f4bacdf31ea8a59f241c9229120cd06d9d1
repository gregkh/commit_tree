blk-mq-debugfs: fix device sched directory for default scheduler

In blk_mq_debugfs_register(), I remembered to set up the per-hctx sched
directories if a default scheduler was already configured by
blk_mq_sched_init() from blk_mq_init_allocated_queue(), but I didn't do
the same for the device-wide sched directory. Fix it.
