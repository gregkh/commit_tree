arm64: dts: marvell: re-order RTC nodes in Marvell CP110 description

In both the CP110 master and slave description, the node describing
the RTC was at the wrong place when taking into account increasing
register addresses. Interestingly, it was not even at the same (wrong)
place in both files.

This commit adjusts that, making the master and slave descriptions
more aligned.
