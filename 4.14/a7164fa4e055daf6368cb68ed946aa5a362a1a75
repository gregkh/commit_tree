btrfs: prepare for extensions in compression options

This is a minimal patch intended to be backported to older kernels.
We're going to extend the string specifying the compression method and
this would fail on kernels before that change (the string is compared
exactly).

Relax the string matching only to the prefix, ie. ignoring anything that
goes after "zlib" or "lzo", regardless of th format extension we decide
to use. This applies to the mount options and properties.

That way, patched old kernels could be booted on systems already
utilizing the new compression spec.

Applicable since commit 63541927c8d11, v3.14.
