rpmsg: glink: Allow unaligned data access

Glink protocol requires that each message is aligned on a 8 byte offset.
This is purely a restriction from glink, so in order to support clients
which do not adher to this, allow data packets of any size, but align
the head index accordingly, effectively removing the alignment
restriction.
