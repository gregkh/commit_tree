iio: adc: ti-ads1015: avoid getting stale result after runtime resume

This driver assumes that the device is operating in the continuous
conversion mode which performs the conversion continuously.  So this driver
doesn't insert a wait time before reading the conversion register if the
configuration is not changed from a previous request.

This assumption is broken if the device is runtime suspended and entered
a power-down state.  The forthcoming request causes reading a stale result
from the conversion register as the device is runtime resumed just before.

Fix it by adding a flag to detect that condition and insert a necessary
wait time.
