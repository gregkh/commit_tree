ARM: dts: imx7d-sdb: Pass 'enable-gpios' and 'power-supply' properties

Currently the LCD is turned on thanks to the bootloader initialization.

In order to make the kernel to turn on the LCD on is own, pass the
'enable-gpios' and 'power-supply' properties.

Also, the GPIO1_IO01 is not used as PWM functionality on this board. It is
connected to the PWREN pin of connector J14 and has a GPIO function, so
remove the PWM1 node and change the GPIO1_IO01 IOMUX to GPIO function.
