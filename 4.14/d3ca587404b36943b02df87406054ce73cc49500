powerpc/mm: Fix reporting of kernel execute faults

We currently test for is_exec and DSISR_PROTFAULT but that doesn't
make sense as this is the wrong error bit to test for an execute
permission failure.

In fact, we had code that would return early if we had an exec
fault in kernel mode so I think that was just dead code anyway.

Finally the location of that test is awkward and prevents further
simplifications.

So instead move that test into a helper along with the existing
early test for kernel exec faults and out of range accesses,
and put it all in a "bad_kernel_fault()" helper. While at it
test the correct error bits.
