HID: wacom: Correct coordinate system of touchring and pen twist

The MobileStudio Pro, Cintiq Pro, and 2nd-gen Intuos Pro devices use a
different coordinate system for their touchring and pen twist than prior
devices. Prior devices had zero aligned to the tablet's left and would
increase clockwise. Userspace expects data from the kernel to be in this
old coordinate space, so adjustments are necessary.

While the coordinate system for pen twist is formally defined by the HID
standard, no such definition existed for the touchring at the time these
tablets were introduced. Future tablets are expected to report touchring
data using the same "zero-up clockwise-increasing" coordinate system
defined for twist.
