nvmet-fc: simplify sg list handling

The existing nvmet_fc sg list handling has 2 faults:
a) the request between LLDD and transport has too large of an sg
   list (256 elements), which is normally 256k (64 elements).
b) sglist handling doesn't optimize on the fact that each element
   is a page.

This patch removes the static sg list in the request and uses the
dynamic list already present in the nvmet_fc transport. It also
simplies the handling of the sg list on multiple sequences to
take advantage of the per-page divisions.
