s390/perf: fix bug when creating per-thread event

A per-thread event could not be created correctly like below:

    perf record --per-thread -e rB0000 -- sleep 1
    Error:
    The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 19 (No such device) for event (rB0000).
    /bin/dmesg may provide additional information.
    No CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y kernel support configured?

This bug was introduced by:

    commit c311c797998c1e70eade463dd60b843da4f1a203

    cpumask: make "nr_cpumask_bits" unsigned

If a per-thread event is not attached to any CPU, the cpu field
in struct perf_event is -1. The above commit converts the CPU number
to unsigned int, which result in an illegal CPU number.
