netvsc: use ERR_PTR to avoid dereference issues

The rndis_filter_device_add function is called both in
probe context and RTNL context,and creates the netvsc_device
inner structure. It is easier to get the RTNL lock annotation
correct if it returns the object directly, rather than implicitly
by updating network device private data.
