powerpc/powernv/vas: Define vas_tx_win_open()

Define an interface to open a VAS send window. This interface is
intended to be used the Nest Accelerator (NX) driver(s) to open
a send window and use it to submit compression/encryption requests
to a VAS receive window.

The receive window, identified by the [vasid, cop] parameters, must
already be open in VAS (i.e connected to an NX engine).
