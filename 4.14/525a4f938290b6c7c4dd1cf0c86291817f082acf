drm/i915/fbc: add comments to the FBC auxiliary structs

I wrote this code an year and a half ago and I couldn't exactly
remember the main differences of these two structures when reviewing a
new FBC patch. Add some comments to help explain what's the purpose of
each struct.

For the record, the original commits are:
 b183b3f14395 ("drm/i915/fbc: introduce struct intel_fbc_reg_params")
 aaf78d276ba0 ("drm/i915/fbc: introduce struct intel_fbc_state_cache")
