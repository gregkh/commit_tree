f2fs: fix potential panic during fstrim

As Ju Hyung Park reported:

"When 'fstrim' is called for manual trim, a BUG() can be triggered
randomly with this patch.

I'm seeing this issue on both x86 Desktop and arm64 Android phone.

On x86 Desktop, this was caused during Ubuntu boot-up. I have a
cronjob installed which calls 'fstrim -v /' during boot. On arm64
Android, this was caused during GC looping with 1ms gc_min_sleep_time
& gc_max_sleep_time."

Root cause of this issue is that f2fs_wait_discard_bios can only be
used by f2fs_put_super, because during put_super there must be no
other referrers, so it can ignore discard entry's reference count
when removing the entry, otherwise in other caller we will hit bug_on
in __remove_discard_cmd as there may be other issuer added reference
count in discard entry.
