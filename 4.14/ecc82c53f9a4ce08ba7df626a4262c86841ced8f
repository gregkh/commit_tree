RDMA/core: Add and expose static device index

This patch adds static device index in similar fashion to
already available in netdev world (struct net->ifindex).

In downstream patches, the RDMA nelink will use this idx-to-ib_device
conversion, so as part of this commit, we are exposing the translation
function to be visible for IB/core users.
