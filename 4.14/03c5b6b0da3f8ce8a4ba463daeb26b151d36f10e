ACPICA: acpidump: Add DSDT/FACS instance support for Linux and EFI

ACPICA commit 343fc31840d40c06001f3b170ee5bcdfd3c7f3e0

ACPI spec allows to configure different 32-bit/64-bit table addresses for
DSDT and FACS. And for FACS, it's meaningful to dump both of them as they
are used to support different suspend protocols.

While:
1. on Linux, only 1 instance is supported for DSDT/FACS; and
2. on EFI, the code in osl_get_table() is buggy with special table instances,
   causing endless file dump for such tables (reported by Shao Ming in link
   #2).

This patch adds DSDT/FACS instance support for Linux/EFI acpidump. Fixed by
Lv Zheng.
