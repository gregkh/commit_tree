exec: Use sane stack rlimit under secureexec

For a secureexec, before memory layout selection has happened, reset the
stack rlimit to something sane to avoid the caller having control over
the resulting layouts.

$ ulimit -s
8192
$ ulimit -s unlimited
$ /bin/sh -c 'ulimit -s'
unlimited
$ sudo /bin/sh -c 'ulimit -s'
8192
