NFS: Fix NFSv2 security settings

For a while now any NFSv2 mount where sec= is specified uses
AUTH_NULL. If sec= is not specified, the mount uses AUTH_UNIX.
Commit e68fd7c8071d ("mount: use sec= that was specified on the
command line") attempted to address a very similar problem with
NFSv3, and should have fixed this too, but it has a bug.

The MNTv1 MNT procedure does not return a list of security flavors,
so our client makes up a list containing just AUTH_NULL. This should
enable nfs_verify_authflavors() to assign the sec= specified flavor,
but instead, it incorrectly sets it to AUTH_NULL.

I expect this would also be a problem for any NFSv3 server whose
MNTv3 MNT procedure returned a security flavor list containing only
AUTH_NULL.
