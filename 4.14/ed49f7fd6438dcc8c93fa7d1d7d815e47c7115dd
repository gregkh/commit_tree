powerpc/xmon: Disable tracing when entering xmon

If tracing is enabled and you get into xmon, the tracing buffer
continues to be updated, causing possible loss of data and unnecessary
tracing information coming from xmon functions.

This patch simple disables tracing when entering xmon, and re-enables it
if the kernel is resumed (with 'x').
