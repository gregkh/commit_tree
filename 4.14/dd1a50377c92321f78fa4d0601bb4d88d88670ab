perf trace: Introduce filter_loop_pids()

No change in functionality, just to make clearer that what we want when
filtering the tracer pid in a system wide tracing session is to avoid a
feedback loop.

This also paves the way for a more interesting loop avoidance algorithm,
one that tries to figure out if we are in a ssh session, xterm, etc.
