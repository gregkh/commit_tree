powerpc/eeh: Reduce to one the number of places where edev is allocated

arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh_dev.c:57 is the only legit place where edev
is allocated; other 2 places allocate it on stack and in the heap for
a very short period of time to use eeh_pe_get() as takes edev.

This changes eeh_pe_get() to receive required parameters explicitly.

This removes unnecessary temporary allocation of edev.

This uses the "pe_no" name instead of the "pe_config_addr" name as
it actually is a PE number and not a config space address as it seemed.
