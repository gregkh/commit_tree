bpf/verifier: when pruning a branch, ignore its write marks

The fact that writes occurred in reaching the continuation state does
 not screen off its reads from us, because we're not really its parent.
So detect 'not really the parent' in do_propagate_liveness, and ignore
 write marks in that case.
