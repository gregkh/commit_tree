perf stat: Use group read for event groups

Make perf stat use  group read if there  are groups defined. The group
read will get the values for all member of groups within a single
syscall instead of calling read syscall for every event.

We can see considerable less amount of kernel cycles spent on single
group read, than reading each event separately, like for following perf
stat command:

  # perf stat -e {cycles,instructions} -I 10 -a sleep 1

Monitored with "perf stat -r 5 -e '{cycles:u,cycles:k}'"

Before:

        24,325,676      cycles:u
       297,040,775      cycles:k

       1.038554134 seconds time elapsed

After:
        25,034,418      cycles:u
       158,256,395      cycles:k

       1.036864497 seconds time elapsed
