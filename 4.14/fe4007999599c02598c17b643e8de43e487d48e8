ipv6: fib: Provide offload indication using nexthop flags

IPv6 routes currently lack nexthop flags as in IPv4. This has several
implications.

In the forwarding path, it requires us to check the carrier state of the
nexthop device and potentially ignore a linkdown route, instead of
checking for RTNH_F_LINKDOWN.

It also requires capable drivers to use the user facing IPv6-specific
route flags to provide offload indication, instead of using the nexthop
flags as in IPv4.

Add nexthop flags to IPv6 routes in the 40 bytes hole and use it to
provide offload indication instead of the RTF_OFFLOAD flag, which is
removed while it's still not part of any official kernel release.

In the near future we would like to use the field for the
RTNH_F_{LINKDOWN,DEAD} flags, but this change is more involved and might
not be ready in time for the current cycle.
