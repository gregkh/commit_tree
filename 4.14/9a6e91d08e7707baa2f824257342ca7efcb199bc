cpufreq: ti: Fix 'of_node_put' being called twice in error handling path

If 'dev_pm_opp_set_supported_hw()' fails, 'opp_data->opp_node' refcount
will be decremented 2 times.
One, just a few lines above, and another one in the error handling path.

Fix it by simply moving the 'of_node_put' call of the normal path.
