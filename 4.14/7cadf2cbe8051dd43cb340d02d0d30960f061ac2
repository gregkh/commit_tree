selftests/bpf: check the instruction dumps are populated

Add a basic test for checking whether kernel is populating
the jited and xlated BPF images.  It was used to confirm
the behaviour change from commit d777b2ddbecf ("bpf: don't
zero out the info struct in bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd()"),
which made bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd() usable for retrieving
the image dumps.
