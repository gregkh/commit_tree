mlxsw: spectrum_router: Reflect IPv6 neighbours to the device

As with IPv4, listen to NEIGH_UPDATE events from the ndisc table and
program relevant neighbours to the device's neighbour table.

Note that neighbours with a link-local IP address aren't programmed, as
packets with a link-local destination IP are trapped after LPM lookup
and never reach the neighbour table.
