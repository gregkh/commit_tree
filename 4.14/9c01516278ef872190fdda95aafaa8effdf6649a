percpu: update the header comment and pcpu_build_alloc_info comments

The header comment for percpu memory is a little hard to parse and is
not super clear about how the first chunk is managed. This adds a
little more clarity to the situation.

There is also quite a bit of tricky logic in the pcpu_build_alloc_info.
This adds a restructure of a comment to add a little more information.
Unfortunately, you will still have to piece together a handful of other
comments too, but should help direct you to the meaningful comments.
