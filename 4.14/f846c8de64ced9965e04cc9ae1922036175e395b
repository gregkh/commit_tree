drm/i915/gvt: Optimize ring siwtch 2x faster by removing unnecessary POSTING_READ

There are lots of POSTING_READ alongside each mmio write Op. While
actually this is not necessary. It just bring too much latency since
PCIe read Op is very slow which is of non-posted transaction.

For PCIe device, the mem transaction for strong ordering rules are:
  o PCIe mmio write sequence is FIFO. Posted request cannot
    pass previous posted request.
  o PCIe mmio read will not go ahead of previous write.

Intel graphics doesn't support RO, so we can apply above rules. In
our case, we only need one POSTING_READ at last. This can remove
half of mmio read Op and then the average ring switch performance
is nearly doubled.
