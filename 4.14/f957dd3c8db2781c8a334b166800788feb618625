brcmfmac: feature check for multi-scheduled scan fails on bcm4345 devices

The firmware feature check introduced for multi-scheduled scan is also
failing for bcm4345 devices resulting in a firmware crash.
The reason for this crash has not yet been root cause so this patch avoids
the feature check for those device as a short-term fix.
