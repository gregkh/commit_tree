of_mdio: use of_property_read_u32_array()

The "fixed-link" prop support predated of_property_read_u32_array(), so
basically had to open-code it. Using the modern API saves 24 bytes of the
object code (ARM gcc 4.8.5); the only behavior change would be that the
prop length check is now less strict (however the strict pre-check done
in of_phy_is_fixed_link() is left intact anyway)...
