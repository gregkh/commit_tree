ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add driver structures to be filled from topology manifest

The topology manifest would include module common data including resource
and interface table. The resource table consists of resources required by
the dsp module such as buffer size, cycles per second, number of
input/output pins. And, the interface table consists of pcm parameters per
module which can be referenced later.

So define the structures accordingly to represent topology manifest data in
the driver.
