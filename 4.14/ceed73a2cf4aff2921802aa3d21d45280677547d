drivers: net: ethernet: qualcomm: rmnet: Initial implementation

RmNet driver provides a transport agnostic MAP (multiplexing and
aggregation protocol) support in embedded module. Module provides
virtual network devices which can be attached to any IP-mode
physical device. This will be used to provide all MAP functionality
on future hardware in a single consistent location.
