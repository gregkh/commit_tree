KVM: VMX: simplify and fix vmx_vcpu_pi_load

The simplify part: do not touch pi_desc.nv, we can set it when the
VCPU is first created.  Likewise, pi_desc.sn is only handled by
vmx_vcpu_pi_load, do not touch it in __pi_post_block.

The fix part: do not check kvm_arch_has_assigned_device, instead
check the SN bit to figure out whether vmx_vcpu_pi_put ran before.
This matches what the previous patch did in pi_post_block.
