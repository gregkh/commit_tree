aquantia: Fix Tx queue hangups

Driver did a poor job in managing its Tx queues: Sometimes it could stop
tx queues due to link down condition in aq_nic_xmit - but never waked up
them. That led to Tx path total suspend.
This patch fixes this and improves generic queue management:
- introduces queue restart counter
- uses generic netif_ interface to disable and enable tx path
- refactors link up/down condition and introduces dmesg log event when
  link changes.
- introduces new constant for minimum descriptors count required for queue
