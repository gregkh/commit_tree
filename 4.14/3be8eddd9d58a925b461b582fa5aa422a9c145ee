drm/vc4: Add exec flags to allow forcing a specific X/Y tile walk order.

This is useful to allow GL to provide defined results for overlapping
glBlitFramebuffer, which X11 in turn uses to accelerate uncomposited
window movement without first blitting to a temporary.  x11perf
-copywinwin100 goes from 1850/sec to 4850/sec.

v2: Default to the same behavior as before when the flags aren't
    passed. (suggested by Boris)
