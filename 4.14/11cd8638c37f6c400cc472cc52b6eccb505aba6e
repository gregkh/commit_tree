mm, page_alloc: remove stop_machine from build_all_zonelists

build_all_zonelists has been (ab)using stop_machine to make sure that
zonelists do not change while somebody is looking at them.  This is is
just a gross hack because a) it complicates the context from which we
can call build_all_zonelists (see 3f906ba23689 ("mm/memory-hotplug:
switch locking to a percpu rwsem")) and b) is is not really necessary
especially after "mm, page_alloc: simplify zonelist initialization" and
c) it doesn't really provide the protection it claims (see below).

Updates of the zonelists happen very seldom, basically only when a zone
becomes populated during memory online or when it loses all the memory
during offline.  A racing iteration over zonelists could either miss a
zone or try to work on one zone twice.  Both of these are something we
can live with occasionally because there will always be at least one
zone visible so we are not likely to fail allocation too easily for
example.

Please note that the original stop_machine approach doesn't really
provide a better exclusion because the iteration might be interrupted
half way (unless the whole iteration is preempt disabled which is not
the case in most cases) so the some zones could still be seen twice or a
zone missed.

I have run the pathological online/offline of the single memblock in the
movable zone while stressing the same small node with some memory
pressure.

	echo offline > memory34/state

done

root@test1:/mnt/data/test/linux-3.7-rc5# numactl --preferred=1 make -j4

and it survived without any unexpected behavior.  While this is not
really a great testing coverage it should exercise the allocation path
quite a lot.
