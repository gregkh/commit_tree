earlycon: initialise baud field of earlycon device structure

For now baud field of earlycon structure device is't initialised at all
in of_setup_earlycon (in opposit–µ to register_earlycon).

So when I use stdout-path to point earlycon device
(like stdout-path = &serial or stdout-path = "serial:115200n8")
baud field of earlycon device structure remains uninitialised and
earlycon initialization is not performed correctly as
of_setup_earlycon is used.
When pass all arguments via bootargs
(like bootargs = "earlycon=uart8250,mmio32,0xf0005000,115200n8")
initialization is performed correctly as register_earlycon is used.

So initialise baud field of earlycon device structure by value of
"current-speed" property from device tree or from options
(if they exist) when we use of_setup_earlycon
