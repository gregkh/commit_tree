perf: cs-etm: Fix ETMv4 CONFIGR entry in perf.data file

The value passed into the perf.data file for the CONFIGR register in ETMv4
was incorrectly being set to the command line options/ETMv3 value.

Adds bit definitions and function to remap this value to the correct ETMv4
CONFIGR bit values for all selected options.
