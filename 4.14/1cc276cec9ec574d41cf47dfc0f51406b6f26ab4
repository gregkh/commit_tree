sctp: add the missing sock_owned_by_user check in sctp_icmp_redirect

Now sctp processes icmp redirect packet in sctp_icmp_redirect where
it calls sctp_transport_dst_check in which tp->dst can be released.

The problem is before calling sctp_transport_dst_check, it doesn't
check sock_owned_by_user, which means tp->dst could be freed while
a process is accessing it with owning the socket.

An use-after-free issue could be triggered by this.

This patch is to fix it by checking sock_owned_by_user before calling
sctp_transport_dst_check in sctp_icmp_redirect, so that it would not
release tp->dst if users still hold sock lock.

Besides, the same issue fixed in commit 45caeaa5ac0b ("dccp/tcp: fix
routing redirect race") on sctp also needs this check.
