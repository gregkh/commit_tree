scsi: lpfc: Fix oops when NVME Target is discovered in a nonNVME environment

lpfc oops when it discovers a NVME target but is configured for SCSI
only operation. Oops is in lpfc_nvme_register_port+0x33/0x300.

The localport is not valid so it should not have been referenced.

Added validity check for localport
