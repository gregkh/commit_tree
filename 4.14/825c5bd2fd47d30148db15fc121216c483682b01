srcu: Move rcu_scheduler_starting() from Tiny RCU to Tiny SRCU

Other than lockdep support, Tiny RCU has no need for the
scheduler status.  However, Tiny SRCU will need this to control
boot-time behavior independent of lockdep.  Therefore, this commit
moves rcu_scheduler_starting() from kernel/rcu/tiny_plugin.h to
kernel/rcu/srcutiny.c.  This in turn allows the complete removal of
kernel/rcu/tiny_plugin.h.
