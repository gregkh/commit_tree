perf events parse: Use just one parse events state struct

Andi reported problems when parse errors were detected with vendor
events (json), because in the yyparse/parse_events_parse function we
dereferenced the _data parameter to two different structs, with
different layouts, which ended up making parse_events_evlist->error to
point to random stack addresses.

Fix it by making _data to always be struct parse_events_state, changing
the only place where 'struct parse_events_term' was used in
parse_events.y.
