rcu: Drive TASKS_RCU directly off of PREEMPT

The actual use of TASKS_RCU is only when PREEMPT, otherwise RCU-sched
is used instead.  This commit therefore makes synchronize_rcu_tasks()
and call_rcu_tasks() available always, but mapped to synchronize_sched()
and call_rcu_sched(), respectively, when !PREEMPT.  This approach also
allows some #ifdefs to be removed from rcutorture.
