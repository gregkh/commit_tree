rtlwifi: rtl_pci_probe: Fix fail path of _rtl_pci_find_adapter

_rtl_pci_find_adapter fail path will jump to label fail3 for
unsupported adapter types.

However, on course for fail3 there will be call rtl_deinit_core
before rtl_init_core.

For the inclusion of checking pci_iounmap this fail can be moved to
fail2.
