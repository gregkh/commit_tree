x86/mm/64: Fix reboot interaction with CR4.PCIDE

Trying to reboot via real mode fails with PCID on: long mode cannot
be exited while CR4.PCIDE is set.  (No, I have no idea why, but the
SDM and actual CPUs are in agreement here.)  The result is a GPF and
a hang instead of a reboot.

I didn't catch this in testing because neither my computer nor my VM
reboots this way.  I can trigger it with reboot=bios, though.
