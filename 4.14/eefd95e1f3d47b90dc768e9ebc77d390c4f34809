selftests: timers: set-timer-lat: Fix hang when testing unsupported alarms

When timer_create() fails on a bootime or realtime clock, setup_timer()
returns 0 as if timer has been set. Callers wait forever for the timer
to expire.

This hang is seen on a system that doesn't have support for:

CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM   ABSTIME missing CAP_WAKE_ALARM? : [UNSUPPORTED]

Test hangs waiting for a timer that hasn't been set to expire. Fix
setup_timer() to return 1, add handling in callers to detect the
unsupported case and return 0 without waiting to not fail the test.
