nfp: provide ethtool_drvinfo on representors

Extend representors' ethtool ops to show basic info like firmware
version, driver version, and driver name.

While at it don't set drvinfo.n_stats and drvinfo.regdump_len,
core will invoke appropriate handlers to get those.

A helper is added to turn a netdev into nfp_app for convenience.
