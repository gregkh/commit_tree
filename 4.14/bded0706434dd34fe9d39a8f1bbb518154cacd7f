powerpc/pseries/le: Work around a firmware quirk

Some PowerVM firmware when delivering a system reset interrupt to a
little endian OS will mess up SRR registers. They are byteswapped, and
SRR1 is incorrect. An example from a crash:

  NIP: 14dd0900000000c0
  MSR: 1000000200000080

It's possible to detect this pattern in SRR1 (that would never happen
in normal operation), and at least fix the NIP. After this patch, the
same interrupt reports NIP properly:

  NIP [c00000000009dd14] plpar_hcall_norets+0x1c/0x28
