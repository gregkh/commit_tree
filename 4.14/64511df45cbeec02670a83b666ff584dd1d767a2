iwlwifi: mvm: remove the corunning support

The corunning block was supposed to help in coex scenarios.
It required the driver to configure the firmware based on
the coupling between the two antennas of the devices.
This was never in use and the configuration sent by the
driver has always been blank.
Remove all that code.
