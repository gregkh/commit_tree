drm/i915: Work around GCC anonymous union initialization bug

GCC 4.4 can't cope with anonymous union initializers which seems to be a
bug in that version (see the Reference) and is fixed since GCC version
4.6. A workaround which is also used elsewhere in the kernel for the
same purpose is to wrap the initialization in curly braces, so do the
same here.
