mm, THP, swap: support splitting THP for THP swap out

After adding swapping out support for THP (Transparent Huge Page), it is
possible that a THP in swap cache (partly swapped out) need to be split.
To split such a THP, the swap cluster backing the THP need to be split
too, that is, the CLUSTER_FLAG_HUGE flag need to be cleared for the swap
cluster.  The patch implemented this.

And because the THP swap writing needs the THP keeps as huge page during
writing.  The PageWriteback flag is checked before splitting.
