xfs: move two more RT specific functions into CONFIG_XFS_RT

The last cleanup introduced two harmless warnings:

fs/xfs/xfs_fsmap.c:480:1: warning: '__xfs_getfsmap_rtdev' defined but not used
fs/xfs/xfs_fsmap.c:372:1: warning: 'xfs_getfsmap_rtdev_rtbitmap_helper' defined but not used

This moves those two functions as well.
