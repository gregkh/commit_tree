arm64: neon: Forbid when irqs are disabled

Currently, may_use_simd() can return true if IRQs are disabled.  If
the caller goes ahead and calls kernel_neon_begin(), this can
result in use of local_bh_enable() in an unsafe context.

In particular, __efi_fpsimd_begin() may do this when calling EFI as
part of system shutdown.

This patch ensures that callers don't think they can use
kernel_neon_begin() in such a context.
