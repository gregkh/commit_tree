spi: spi-sh: fix error return code in spi_sh_probe()

platform_get_irq() returns an error code, but the spi-sh driver
ignores it and always returns -ENODEV. This is not correct and,
prevents -EPROBE_DEFER from being propagated properly.

Print and propagate the return value of platform_get_irq on failure.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
