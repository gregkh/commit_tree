arm64: assembler: allow adr_this_cpu to use the stack pointer

Given that adr_this_cpu already requires a temp register in addition
to the destination register, tweak the instruction sequence so that sp
may be used as well.

This will simplify switching to per-cpu stacks in subsequent patches. While
this limits the range of adr_this_cpu, to +/-4GiB, we don't currently use
adr_this_cpu in modules, and this is not problematic for the main kernel image.
