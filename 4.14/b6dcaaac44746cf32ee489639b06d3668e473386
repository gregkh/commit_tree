drm/vblank: _ioctl posfix for ioctl handler

I alwasy get confused about drm_wait_vblank for a split second until I
realize it's the ioctl handler. Unconfuse me, and do it for the legacy
modeset vblank control ioctl too.

While at it also noticed that I misplaced the irq ioctl handler in the
internal header file.
