s390/mm: make pmdp_invalidate() do invalidation only

Commit 227be799c39a ("s390/mm: uninline pmdp_xxx functions from pgtable.h")
inadvertently changed the behavior of pmdp_invalidate(), so that it now
clears the pmd instead of just marking it as invalid. Fix this by restoring
the original behavior.

A possible impact of the misbehaving pmdp_invalidate() would be the
MADV_DONTNEED races (see commits ced10803 and 58ceeb6b), although we
should not have any negative impact on the related dirty/young flags,
since those flags are not set by the hardware on s390.
