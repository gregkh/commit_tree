KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix setting of storage key in H_ENTER

In handling a H_ENTER hypercall, the code in kvmppc_do_h_enter
clobbers the high-order two bits of the storage key, which is stored
in a split field in the second doubleword of the HPTE.  Any storage
key number above 7 hence fails to operate correctly.

This makes sure we preserve all the bits of the storage key.
