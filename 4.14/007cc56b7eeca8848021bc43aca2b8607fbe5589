block: always attach cgroup info into bio

blkcg_bio_issue_check() already gets blkcg for a BIO.
bio_associate_blkcg() uses a percpu refcounter, so it's a very cheap
operation. There is no point we don't attach the cgroup info into bio at
blkcg_bio_issue_check. This also makes blktrace outputs correct cgroup
info.
