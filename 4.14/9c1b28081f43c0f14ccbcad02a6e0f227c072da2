GFS2: Clear gl_object if gfs2_create_inode fails

If function gfs2_create_inode fails after the inode has been
created (for example, if the inode_refresh fails for some reason)
the function was setting gl_object but never clearing it again.
The glocks are left pointing to a freed inode. This patch adds
the calls to clear gl_object in the appropriate error paths.
