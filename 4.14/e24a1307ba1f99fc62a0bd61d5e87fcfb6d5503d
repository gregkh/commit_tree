mm/hugetlb: Allow arch to override and call the weak function

When running in guest mode ppc64 supports a different mechanism for hugetlb
allocation/reservation. The LPAR management application called HMC can
be used to reserve a set of hugepages and we pass the details of
reserved pages via device tree to the guest. (more details in
htab_dt_scan_hugepage_blocks()) . We do the memblock_reserve of the range
and later in the boot sequence, we add the reserved range to huge_boot_pages.

But to enable 16G hugetlb on baremetal config (when we are not running as guest)
we want to do memblock reservation during boot. Generic code already does this
