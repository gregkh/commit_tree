PCI: pciehp: Report power fault only once until we clear it

When a power fault occurs, the power controller sets Power Fault Detected
in the Slot Status register, and pciehp_isr() queues an INT_POWER_FAULT
event to handle it.

It also clears Power Fault Detected, but since nothing has yet changed to
correct the power fault, the power controller will likely set it again
immediately, which may cause an infinite loop when pcie_isr() rechecks
Slot Status.

Fix that by masking off Power Fault Detected from new events if the driver
hasn't seen the power fault clear from the previous handling attempt.
