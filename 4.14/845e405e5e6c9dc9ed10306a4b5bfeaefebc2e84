pinctrl: cherryview: fix issues caused by dynamic gpio irqs mapping

New GPIO IRQs are allocated and mapped dynamically by default when
GPIO IRQ infrastructure is used by cherryview-pinctrl driver.
This causes issues on some Intel platforms [1][2] with broken BIOS which
hardcodes Linux IRQ numbers in their ACPI tables.

On such platforms cherryview-pinctrl driver should allocate and map all
GPIO IRQs at probe time.
Side effect - "Cannot allocate irq_descs @ IRQ%d, assuming pre-allocated\n"
can be seen at boot log.

NOTE. It still may fail if boot sequence will changed and some interrupt
controller will be probed before cherryview-pinctrl which will shift Linux IRQ
numbering (expected with CONFIG_SPARCE_IRQ enabled).
