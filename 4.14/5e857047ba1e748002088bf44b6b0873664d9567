dmaengine: rcar-dmac: initialize all data before registering IRQ handler

Anton Volkov noticed that engine->dev is NULL before
of_dma_controller_register() in probe.
Thus there might be a NULL pointer dereference in
rcar_dmac_chan_start_xfer while accessing chan->chan.device->dev which
is equal to (&dmac->engine)->dev.
On same reason, same and similar things will happen if we didn't
initialize all necessary data before calling register irq function.
To be more safety code, this patch initialize all necessary data
before calling register irq function.
