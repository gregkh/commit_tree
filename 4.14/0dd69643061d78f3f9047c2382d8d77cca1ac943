libnvdimm: Stop using HPAGE_SIZE

Currently libnvdimm uses HPAGE_SIZE as the default alignment for DAX and
PFN devices. HPAGE_SIZE is the default hugetlbfs page size and when
hugetlbfs is disabled it defaults to PAGE_SIZE. Given DAX has more
in common with THP than hugetlbfs we should proably be using
HPAGE_PMD_SIZE, but this is undefined when THP is disabled so lets just
give it a new name.

The other usage of HPAGE_SIZE in libnvdimm is when determining how large
the altmap should be. For the reasons mentioned above it doesn't really
make sense to use HPAGE_SIZE here either. PMD_SIZE seems to be safe to
use in generic code and it happens to match the vmemmap allocation block
on x86 and Power. It's still a hack, but it's a slightly nicer hack.
