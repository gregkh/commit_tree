powerpc/lib/sstep: Fix count leading zeros instructions

According to the GCC documentation, the behaviour of __builtin_clz()
and __builtin_clzl() is undefined if the value of the input argument
is zero. Without handling this special case, these builtins have been
used for emulating the following instructions:
  * Count Leading Zeros Word (cntlzw[.])
  * Count Leading Zeros Doubleword (cntlzd[.])

This fixes the emulated behaviour of these instructions by adding an
additional check for this special case.
