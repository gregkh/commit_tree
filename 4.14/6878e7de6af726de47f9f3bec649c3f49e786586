driver core: suppress sending MODALIAS in UNBIND uevents

The current udev rules cause modules to be loaded on all device events save
for "remove". With the introduction of KOBJ_BIND/KOBJ_UNBIND this causes
issues, as driver modules that have devices bound to their drivers get
immediately reloaded, and it appears to the user that module unloading doe
snot work.

The standard udev matching rule is foillowing:

ENV{MODALIAS}=="?*", RUN{builtin}+="kmod load $env{MODALIAS}"

Given that MODALIAS data is not terribly useful for UNBIND event, let's zap
it from the generated uevent environment until we get userspace updated
with the correct udev rule that only loads modules on "add" event.
