net/mlx5e: Send PAOS command on interface up/down

Upon interface up/down, driver will send PAOS (Ports Administrative and
Operational Status Register) in order to inform the Firmware on the
desired status of the port by the driver.

Since now we might change physical link status on mlx5e_open/close,
logical VF representor should not use mlx5e_open/close ndos as is, and
should call the logical version mlx5e_open/closed_locked.
