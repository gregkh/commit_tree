usb: musb: musb_cppi41: Fix the address of teardown and autoreq registers

The DA8xx and DSPS platforms don't use the same address for few registers.
On Da8xx, this is causing some issues (e.g. teardown that doesn't work).
Configure the address of the register during the init and use them instead
of constants.
