locking/lockdep: Add a function building a chain between two classes

Crossrelease needs to build a chain between two classes regardless of
their contexts. However, add_chain_cache() cannot be used for that
purpose since it assumes that it's called in the acquisition context
of the hlock. So this patch introduces a new function doing it.
