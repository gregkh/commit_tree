Btrfs: skip checksum when reading compressed data if some IO have failed

Currently even if the underlying disk reports failure on IO,
compressed read endio still gets to verify checksum and reports it as
a checksum error.

In fact, if some IO have failed during reading a compressed data
extent , there's no way the checksum could match, therefore, we can
skip that in order to return error quickly to the upper layer.

Please note that we need to do this after recording the failed mirror
index so that read-repair in the upper layer's endio can work
properly.
