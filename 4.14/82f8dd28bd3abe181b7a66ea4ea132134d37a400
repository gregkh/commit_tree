bpf: fix splat for illegal devmap percpu allocation

It was reported that syzkaller was able to trigger a splat on
devmap percpu allocation due to illegal/unsupported allocation
request size passed to __alloc_percpu():

  [   70.094249] illegal size (32776) or align (8) for percpu allocation
  [   70.094256] ------------[ cut here ]------------
  [   70.094259] WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 3451 at mm/percpu.c:1365 pcpu_alloc+0x96/0x630

This was due to too large max_entries for the map such that we
surpassed the upper limit of PCPU_MIN_UNIT_SIZE. It's fine to
fail naturally here, so switch to __alloc_percpu_gfp() and pass
__GFP_NOWARN instead.
