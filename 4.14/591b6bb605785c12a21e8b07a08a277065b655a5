cs5536: add support for IDE controller variant

Several legacy devices such as Geode-based Cisco ASA appliances
and DB800 development board do possess CS5536 IDE controller
with different PCI id than existing one. Using pata_generic is
not always feasible as at least DB800 requires MSR quirk from
pata_cs5536 to be used with vendor firmware.
