sched/fair: Avoid newidle balance for !active CPUs

On CPU hot unplug, when parking the last kthread we'll try and
schedule into idle to kill the CPU. This last schedule can (and does)
trigger newidle balance because at this point the sched domains are
still up because of commit:

  77d1dfda0e79 ("sched/topology, cpuset: Avoid spurious/wrong domain rebuilds")

Obviously pulling tasks to an already offline CPU is a bad idea, and
all balancing operations _should_ be subject to cpu_active_mask, make
it so.
