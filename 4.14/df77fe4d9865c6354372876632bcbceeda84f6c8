ipv6: fib: Add in-kernel notifications for route add / delete

As with IPv4, allow listeners of the FIB notification chain to receive
notifications whenever a route is added, replaced or deleted. This is
done by placing calls to the FIB notification chain in the two lowest
level functions that end up performing these operations - namely,
fib6_add_rt2node() and fib6_del_route().

Unlike IPv4, APPEND notifications aren't sent as the kernel doesn't
distinguish between "append" (NLM_F_CREATE|NLM_F_APPEND) and "prepend"
(NLM_F_CREATE). If NLM_F_EXCL isn't set, duplicate routes are always
added after the existing duplicate routes.
