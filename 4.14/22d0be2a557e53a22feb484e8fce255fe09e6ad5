drm: arcpgu: Allow some clock deviation in crtc->mode_valid() callback

Currently we expect that clock driver produces the exact same value
as we are requiring. There can, and will, be some deviation
however so we need to take that into account instead of just
rejecting the mode.

According to the HDMI spec we have a max of +-0.5% for the pixel clock
frequency deviation. Lets take that into an advantage and use it to
calculate how much deviation we can support.
