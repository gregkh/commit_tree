include/linux/of.h: provide of_n_{addr,size}_cells wrappers for !CONFIG_OF

The pci-rcar driver is enabled for compile tests, and this has shown that
the driver cannot build without CONFIG_OF, following the inclusion of
commit f8f2fe7355fb ("PCI: rcar: Use new OF interrupt mapping when possible"):

  drivers/pci/host/pcie-rcar.c: In function 'pci_dma_range_parser_init':
  drivers/pci/host/pcie-rcar.c:1039:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'of_n_addr_cells' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    parser->pna = of_n_addr_cells(node);
    ^

As pointed out by Ben Dooks and Geert Uytterhoeven, this is actually
supposed to build fine, which we can achieve if we make the declaration
of of_irq_parse_and_map_pci conditional on CONFIG_OF and provide an
empty inline function otherwise, as we do for a lot of other of
interfaces.

This lets us build the rcar_pci driver again without CONFIG_OF for build
testing.  All platforms using this driver select OF, so this doesn't
change anything for the users.
