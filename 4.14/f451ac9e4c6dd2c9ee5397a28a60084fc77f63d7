staging: typec: tcpm: Do not send PING msgs in TCPM

PING messages are used to monitor the connect/disconnect.
However, when PD is carried over CC, so this is not required.

Also, the spec does not clearly say if PD is possible when
Type-c is connected to Type-A/B. So, removing sending
PING messages altogether.
