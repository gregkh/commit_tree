media: cec: rework the cec event handling

Event handling was always fairly simplistic since there were only
two events. With the addition of pin events this needed to be redesigned.

The state_change and lost_msgs events are now core events with the
guarantee that the last state is always available. The new pin events
are a queue of events (up to 64 for each event) and the oldest event
will be dropped if the application cannot keep up. Lost events are
marked with a new event flag.
