irqchip/mips-gic: Fix shifts to extract register fields

The MIPS GIC driver is incorrectly using __fls to shift registers,
intending to shift to the least significant bit of a value based upon
its mask but instead shifting off all but the value's top bit. It should
actually be using __ffs to shift to the first, not last, bit of the
value.

Apparently the system I used when testing commit 3680746abd87
("irqchip: mips-gic: Convert remaining shared reg access to new
accessors") and commit b2b2e584ceab ("irqchip: mips-gic: Clean up mti,
reserved-cpu-vectors handling") managed to work correctly despite this
issue, but not all systems do...
