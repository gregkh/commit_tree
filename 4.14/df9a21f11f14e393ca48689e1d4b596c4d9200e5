mlxsw: spectrum_router: Use correct config option

I made an embarrassing mistake and used 'IPV6' instead of 'CONFIG_IPV6'
around the function that updates the kernel about IPv6 neighbours
activity. This can be a problem if the kernel has more neighbours than a
certain threshold and it starts deleting those that are supposedly
inactive.
