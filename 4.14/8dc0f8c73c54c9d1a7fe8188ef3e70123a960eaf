i2c: constify internal structures

Check for i2c_algorithm and i2c_adapter_quirks structures that are only
stored in the algo and quirks fields of an i2c_adapter structure
correspondingly. These fields are declared const, so i2c_algorithm and
i2c_adapter_quirks structures that have this property can be declared
as const also.
