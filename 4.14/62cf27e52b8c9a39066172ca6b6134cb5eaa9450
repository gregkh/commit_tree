ipv6: Fix traffic triggered IPsec connections.

A recent patch removed the dst_free() on the allocated
dst_entry in ipv6_blackhole_route(). The dst_free() marked
the dst_entry as dead and added it to the gc list. I.e. it
was setup for a one time usage. As a result we may now have
a blackhole route cached at a socket on some IPsec scenarios.
This makes the connection unusable.

Fix this by marking the dst_entry directly at allocation time
as 'dead', so it is used only once.
