ext4: remove timebomb in ext4_decode_extra_time()

Changing behavior based on the version code is a timebomb waiting to
happen, and not easily bisectable.  Drop it and leave any removal
to explicit developer action. (And I don't think file system
should _ever_ remove backwards compatibility that has no explicit
flag, but I'll leave that to the ext4 folks).
