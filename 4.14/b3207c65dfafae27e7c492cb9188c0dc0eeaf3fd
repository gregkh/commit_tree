usb: xhci: Handle error condition in xhci_stop_device()

xhci_stop_device() calls xhci_queue_stop_endpoint() multiple times
without checking the return value. xhci_queue_stop_endpoint() can
return error if the HC is already halted or unable to queue commands.
This can cause a deadlock condition as xhci_stop_device() would
end up waiting indefinitely for a completion for the command that
didn't get queued. Fix this by checking the return value and bailing
out of xhci_stop_device() in case of error. This patch happens to fix
potential memory leaks of the allocated command structures as well.
