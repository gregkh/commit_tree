pstore: Make default pstorefs root dir perms 0750

Currently only DMESG and CONSOLE record types are protected, and it isn't
obvious that they are using a capability check. Instead switch to explicit
root directory mode of 0750 to keep files private by default. This will
allow the removal of the capability check, which was non-obvious and
forces a process to have possibly too much privilege when simple post-boot
chgrp for readers would be possible without it.
