netvsc: transparent VF management

This patch implements transparent fail over from synthetic NIC to
SR-IOV virtual function NIC in Hyper-V environment. It is a better
alternative to using bonding as is done now. Instead, the receive and
transmit fail over is done internally inside the driver.

Using bonding driver has lots of issues because it depends on the
script being run early enough in the boot process and with sufficient
information to make the association. This patch moves all that
functionality into the kernel.
