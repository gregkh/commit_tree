MIPS: Refactor handling of stack pointer in get_frame_info

Commit 34c2f668d0f6 ("MIPS: microMIPS: Add unaligned access support.")
added handling of microMIPS instructions to manipulate the stack
pointer. The code that was added violates code style rules with long
lines caused by lots of nested conditionals.

The added code interprets (inline) any known stack pointer manipulation
instruction to find the stack frame size. Handling the microMIPS cases
added quite a bit of complication to this function.

Refactor is_sp_move_ins to perform the interpretation of the immediate
as the instruction manipulating the stack pointer is found. This reduces
the amount of indentation required in get_frame_info, and more closely
matches the operation of is_ra_save_ins.
