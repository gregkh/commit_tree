Remove gperf usage from toolchain

It turns out that gperf-3.1 changed types in the generated code in ways
that aren't even trivially detectable without having to generate a test-file.

It's just not worth using tools and libraries from clowns that don't
understand or care about compatibility.  So get rid of gperf.
