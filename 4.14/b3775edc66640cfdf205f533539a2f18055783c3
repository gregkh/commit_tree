media: ov13858: Set default fps as current fps

On format change, sometimes, sensor was streaming at a much higher
FPS than the default. This was resulting in various problems like
frame drops/corruption.

Upon format change, set default vblank as current vblank. This will
ensure that sensor will start streaming at default fps.
