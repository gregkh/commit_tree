ACPICA: CLib: Add short multiply/shift support

ACPICA commit 01b8f5a2350b9cc329cd8402ac8faec36fc501f5

In order to build ACPICA EFI tools with EDK-II on Windows, 64-bit
multiply/shift supports are also required to be implemented. Otherwise,
MSVC complains:
 acpidump.lib(utstrtoul64.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __allmul
 acpidump.lib(uthex.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __aullshr

Note:
1. This patch also splits _EDK2_EFI from _GNU_EFI as they might have
   different math64 supports.
2. Support of gcc math64 is not included in this patch.
3. Support of EDK2 arch independent math64 is done via linking to base_lib.

This patch fixes this issue. Reported by Shao Ming, fixed by Lv Zheng.

For Linux kernel, this patch is a functional no-op.
