arm64: fault: Route pte translation faults via do_translation_fault

We currently route pte translation faults via do_page_fault, which elides
the address check against TASK_SIZE before invoking the mm fault handling
code. However, this can cause issues with the path walking code in
conjunction with our word-at-a-time implementation because
load_unaligned_zeropad can end up faulting in kernel space if it reads
across a page boundary and runs into a page fault (e.g. by attempting to
read from a guard region).

In the case of such a fault, load_unaligned_zeropad has registered a
fixup to shift the valid data and pad with zeroes, however the abort is
reported as a level 3 translation fault and we dispatch it straight to
do_page_fault, despite it being a kernel address. This results in calling
a sleeping function from atomic context:

Fix this by dispatching all translation faults to do_translation_faults,
which avoids invoking the page fault logic for faults on kernel addresses.
