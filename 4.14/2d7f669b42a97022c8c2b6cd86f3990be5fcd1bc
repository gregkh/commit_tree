rtnetlink: do not set notification for tx_queue_len in do_setlink

NETDEV_CHANGE_TX_QUEUE_LEN event process in rtnetlink_event would
send a notification for userspace and tx_queue_len's setting in
do_setlink would trigger NETDEV_CHANGE_TX_QUEUE_LEN.

So it shouldn't set DO_SETLINK_NOTIFY status for this change to
send a notification any more.
