crypto: af_alg - update correct dst SGL entry

When two adjacent TX SGL are processed and parts of both TX SGLs
are pulled into the per-request TX SGL, the wrong per-request
TX SGL entries were updated.

This fixes a NULL pointer dereference when a cipher implementation walks
the TX SGL where some of the SGL entries were NULL.
