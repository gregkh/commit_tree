m68k/mac: Don't hang waiting for Cuda power-down command

Testing shows that the CUDA_POWERDOWN command never completes (for a
Centris 660av or LC 475, at least). So, don't wait for command completion
on those Cuda-based models that do not support soft power. Just proceed to
log the usual message, "It is now safe to turn off your Macintosh."
