Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix bugs in rescind handling

This patch addresses the following bugs in the current rescind handling code:

1. Fixes a race condition where we may be invoking hv_process_channel_removal()
on an already freed channel.

2. Prevents indefinite wait when rescinding sub-channels by correctly setting
the probe_complete state.

I would like to thank Dexuan for patiently reviewing earlier versions of this
patch and identifying many of the issues fixed here.

Greg, please apply this to 4.14-final.
