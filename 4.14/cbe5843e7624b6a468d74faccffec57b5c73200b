staging: typec: Fix endianness warning discovered by sparse

The below warning is resolved by removing the cpu_to_le32() call. This
call was redundant; vdm_run_state_machine() ensures that SVDM responses
have the correct endianness before sending.

typec/tcpm.c:1019:49: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
typec/tcpm.c:1019:49:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [usertype] <noident>
typec/tcpm.c:1019:49:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>
