dmaengine: edma: Align the memcpy acnt array size with the transfer

Memory to Memory transfers does not have any special alignment needs
regarding to acnt array size, but if one of the areas are in memory mapped
regions (like PCIe memory), we need to make sure that the acnt array size
is aligned with the mem copy parameters.

Before "dmaengine: edma: Optimize memcpy operation" change the memcpy was set
up in a different way: acnt == number of bytes in a word based on
__ffs((src | dest | len), bcnt and ccnt for looping the necessary number of
words to comlete the trasnfer.

Instead of reverting the commit we can fix it to make sure that the ACNT size
is aligned to the traswnfer.
