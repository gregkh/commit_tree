net: ipv4: fix l3slave check for index returned in IP_PKTINFO

rt_iif is only set to the actual egress device for the output path. The
recent change to consider the l3slave flag when returning IP_PKTINFO
works for local traffic (the correct device index is returned), but it
broke the more typical use case of packets received from a remote host
always returning the VRF index rather than the original ingress device.
Update the fixup to consider l3slave and rt_iif actually getting set.
