ixgbe: Fix Tx map failure path

This patch is a partial revert of "ixgbe: Don't bother clearing buffer
memory for descriptor rings". Specifically I messed up the exception
handling path a bit and this resulted in us incorrectly adding the count
back in when we didn't need to.

In order to make this simpler I am reverting most of the exception handling
path change and instead just replacing the bit that was handled by the
unmap_and_free call.
