scsi: zfcp: more fitting constant for fc_ct_hdr.ct_reason on port scan response

v2.6.33 commit dbf5dfe9dbce ("[SCSI] zfcp: Use common code definitions for
FC CT structs") replaced own definitions with common code definitions.
While FC_BA_RJT_UNABLE happens to be defined with the same value 9 as
FC_FS_RJT_UNABL and thus also works, here we should use the latter from
fc_gs.h.
See also its use in libfc's fc_disc_gpn_ft_resp().
