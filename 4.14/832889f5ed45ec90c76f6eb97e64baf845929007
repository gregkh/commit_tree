scsi: Improve requeuing behavior

Requests are unprepared and reprepared when being requeued.  Avoid that
requeuing resets .jiffies_at_alloc and .retries by initializing these
two member variables from inside scsi_initialize_rq() and by preserving
both member variables when preparing a request. This patch affects the
requeuing behavior of both the legacy scsi and the scsi-mq code paths.
