nfp: wait for the NSP resource to appear on boot

The control process (NSP) may take some time to complete its
initialization.  This is not a problem on most servers, but
on very fast-booting machines it may not be ready for operation
when driver probes the device.  There is also a version of the
flash in the wild where NSP tries to train the links as part
of init.  To wait for NSP initialization we should make sure
its resource has already been added to the resource table.
NSP adds itself there as last step of init.
