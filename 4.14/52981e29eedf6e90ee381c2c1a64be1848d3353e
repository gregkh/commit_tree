ASoC: codecs: msm8916-wcd-analog: move codec reset to probe

This patch move the codec reset code from dai ops to codec probe, so
that the codec is not held in reset when headset detection block is
still active.

Without this patch the codec block will be in reset as long as its not
actively used, which means headset events will not be functional if the
codec dai is not actively used. Point to note is that the headset
detection blocks will work in low power when there is no active audio
usecase and switch to micbias source when audio usecase is active.

Existing dapms should put the codec in low power state anyway when there
is no audio usecase.
