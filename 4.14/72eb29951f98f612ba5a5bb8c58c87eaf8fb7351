MIPS: Use mips_gic_present() in place of gic_present

In preparation for removing the gic_present global variable, switch to
using the mips_gic_present() function instead. For the most part this is
a straightforward substitution. In cases which previously wrapped the
GIC case in an #ifdef CONFIG_MIPS_GIC that #ifdef has been removed,
since mips_gic_present() will return a compile-time constant false
allowing the affected code to be optimised out anyway.
