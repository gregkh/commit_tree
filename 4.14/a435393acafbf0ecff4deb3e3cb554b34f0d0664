mlx5: move affinity hints assignments to generic code

generic api takes care of spreading affinity similar to
what mlx5 open coded (and even handles better asymmetric
configurations). Ask the generic API to spread affinity
for us, and feed him pre_vectors that do not participate
in affinity settings (which is an improvement to what we
had before).

The affinity assignments should match what mlx5 tried to
do earlier but now we do not set affinity to async, cmd
and pages dedicated vectors.

Also, remove mlx5e_get_cpu and introduce mlx5e_get_node
(used for allocation purposes) and mlx5_get_vector_affinity
(for indirection table construction) as they provide the needed
information. Luckily, we have generic helpers to get cpumask
and node given a irq vector. mlx5_get_vector_affinity will
be used by mlx5_ib in a subsequent patch.
