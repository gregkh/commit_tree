blk-mq-tag: check for NULL rq when iterating tags

Since we introduced blk-mq-sched, the tags->rqs[] array has been
dynamically assigned. So we need to check for NULL when iterating,
since there's a window of time where the bit is set, but we haven't
dynamically assigned the tags->rqs[] array position yet.

This is perfectly safe, since the memory backing of the request is
never going away while the device is alive.
