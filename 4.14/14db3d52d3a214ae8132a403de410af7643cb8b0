powerpc/eeh: Reduce use of pci_dn::node

The pci_dn struct caches a OF device node pointer in order to access
the "ibm,loc-code" property when EEH is recovering.

However, when this happens in eeh_dev_check_failure(), we also have
a pci_dev pointer which should have a valid pointer to the device node
when pci_dn has one (both pointers are not NULL for physical functions
and are NULL for virtual functions).

This changes pci_remove_device_node_info() to look for a parent of
the node being removed, just like pci_add_device_node_info() does when it
references the parent node.

This is the first step to get rid of pci_dn::node.
