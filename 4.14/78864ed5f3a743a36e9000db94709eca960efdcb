pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7796: Fix IPSR and MOD_SEL register pin assignment for FSO pins group

This patch fixes IPSR{12,17,18} and MOD_SEL0 pin assignment for FSO pins
group.

This is a correction because GPSR and IPSR register specification for
R8A7796 SoC was changed in R-Car Gen3 Hardware User's Manual Rev.0.54E.
