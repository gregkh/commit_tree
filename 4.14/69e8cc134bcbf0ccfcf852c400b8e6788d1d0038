bpf: sockmap sample program

This program binds a program to a cgroup and then matches hard
coded IP addresses and adds these to a sockmap.

This will receive messages from the backend and send them to
the client.

     client:X <---> frontend:10000 client:X <---> backend:10001

To keep things simple this is only designed for 1:1 connections
using hard coded values. A more complete example would allow many
backends and clients.

To run,

 # sockmap <cgroup2_dir>
