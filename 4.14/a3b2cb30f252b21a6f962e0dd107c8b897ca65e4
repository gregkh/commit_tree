powerpc: Do not call ppc_md.panic in fadump panic notifier

If fadump is not registered, and no other crash or debug handlers are
registered, the powerpc panic handler stops the guest before the
generic panic code can push out debug information to the console.

Currently, system reset injection causes the guest to silently stop.

Stop calling ppc_md.panic in the panic notifier. crash_fadump already
does rtas_os_term() to terminate the guest if fadump is registered.

Remove ppc_md.panic. Move fadump panic notifier into fadump code.
