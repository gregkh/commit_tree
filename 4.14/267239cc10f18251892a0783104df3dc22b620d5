s390/vmcp: fix uaccess check and avoid undefined behavior

The vmcp device driver should return -EFAULT if get_user() fails, due
to an invalid user space address. In addition the buffer size value
from user space is passed unchecked to get_order(). The return value
of get_order(0) undefined.

Therefore explicitly test for zero before calling get_order() and also
return -EFAULT if get_user() fails.
