udp: remove unreachable ufo branches

Remove two references to ufo in the udp send path that are no longer
reachable now that ufo has been removed.

Commit 85f1bd9a7b5a ("udp: consistently apply ufo or fragmentation")
is a fix to ufo. It is safe to revert what remains of it.

Also, no skb can enter ip_append_page with skb_is_gso true now that
skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_type is no longer set in ip_append_page/_data.
