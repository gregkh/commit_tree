PM / suspend: Use mem_sleep_labels[] strings in messages

Some messages in suspend.c currently print state names from
pm_states[], but that may be confusing if the mem_sleep sysfs
attribute is changed to anything different from "mem", because
in those cases the messages will say either "freeze" or "standby"
after writing "mem" to /sys/power/state.

To avoid the confusion, use mem_sleep_labels[] strings in those
messages instead.
