powerpc/kprobes: Update optprobes to use emulate_update_regs()

Optprobes depended on an updated regs->nip from analyse_instr() to
identify the location to branch back from the optprobes trampoline.
However, since commit 3cdfcbfd32b9d ("powerpc: Change analyse_instr so
it doesn't modify *regs"), analyse_instr() doesn't update the registers
anymore.  Due to this, we end up branching back from the optprobes
trampoline to the same branch into the trampoline resulting in a loop.

Fix this by calling out to emulate_update_regs() before using the nip.
Additionally, explicitly compare the return value from analyse_instr()
to 1, rather than just checking for !0 so as to guard against any
future changes to analyse_instr() that may result in -1 being returned
in more scenarios.
