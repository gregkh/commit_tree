spi: qup: Enable chip select support

Enable chip select support for QUP versions later than v1. The
chip select support was broken in QUP version 1. Hence the chip
select support was removed earlier in an earlier commit
(4a8573abe "spi: qup: Remove chip select function"). Since the
chip select support is functional in recent versions of QUP,
re-enabling it for QUP versions later than v1.
