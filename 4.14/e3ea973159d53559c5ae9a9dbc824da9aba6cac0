ipv6: fib_rules: Check if rule is a default rule

As explained in commit 3c71006d15fd ("ipv4: fib_rules: Check if rule is
a default rule"), drivers supporting IPv6 FIB offload need to be able to
sanitize the rules they don't support and potentially flush their
tables.

Add an IPv6 helper to check if a FIB rule is a default rule.
