powerpc/8xx: Remove SoftwareEmulation()

Since commit aa42c69c67f82 ("[POWERPC] Add support for FP emulation
for the e300c2 core"), program_check_exception() can be called for
math emulation. In that case, 'reason' is 0.

On the 8xx, there is a Software Emulation interrupt which is
called for all unimplemented and illegal instructions. This
interrupt calls SoftwareEmulation() which does almost the
same as program_check_exception() called with reason = 0.

The Software Emulation interrupt sets all reason bits to 0,
it is therefore possible to call program_check_exception()
directly from the interrupt handler.
