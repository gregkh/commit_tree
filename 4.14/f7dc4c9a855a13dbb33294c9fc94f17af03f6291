apparmor: fix off-by-one comparison on MAXMAPPED_SIG

This came in yesterday, and I have verified our regression tests
were missing this and it can cause an oops. Please apply.

There is a an off-by-one comparision on sig against MAXMAPPED_SIG
that can lead to a read outside the sig_map array if sig
is MAXMAPPED_SIG. Fix this.

Verified that the check is an out of bounds case that can cause an oops.

Revised: add comparison fix to second case
