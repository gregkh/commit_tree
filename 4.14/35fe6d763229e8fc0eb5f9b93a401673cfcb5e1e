block: use standard blktrace API to output cgroup info for debug notes

Currently cfq/bfq/blk-throttle output cgroup info in trace in their own
way. Now we have standard blktrace API for this, so convert them to use
it.

Note, this changes the behavior a little bit. cgroup info isn't output
by default, we only do this with 'blk_cgroup' option enabled. cgroup
info isn't output as a string by default too, we only do this with
'blk_cgname' option enabled. Also cgroup info is output in different
position of the note string. I think these behavior changes aren't a big
issue (actually we make trace data shorter which is good), since the
blktrace note is solely for debugging.
