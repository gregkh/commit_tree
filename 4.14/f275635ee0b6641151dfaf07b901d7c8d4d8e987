ceph: wait on writeback after writing snapshot data

In sync mode, writepages() needs to write all dirty pages. But
it can only write dirty pages associated with the oldest snapc.
To write dirty pages associated with next snapc, it needs to wait
until current writes complete.

Without this wait, writepages() keeps looking up dirty pages, but
the found dirty pages are not writeable. It wastes CPU time.
