drm/amdgpu: Don't force BOs into visible VRAM for page faults

There is no need for page faults to force BOs into visible VRAM if it's
full, and the time it takes to do so is great enough to cause noticeable
stuttering. Add GTT as a possible placement so that if visible VRAM is
full, page faults move BOs to GTT instead of evicting other BOs from VRAM.
