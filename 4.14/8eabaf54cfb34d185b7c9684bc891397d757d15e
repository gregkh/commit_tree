drm/amdkfd: Clean up KFD style errors and warnings v2

Using checkpatch.pl -f <file> showed a number of style issues. This
patch addresses as many of them as possible. Some long lines have been
left for readability, but attempts to minimize them have been made.

v2: Broke long lines in gfx_v7 get_fw_version
