mmc: omap_hsmmc: Reduce max_segs for reliability

Reduce max_segs to 64, a value that allows allocation of an entire
EDMA descriptor list within a single page - EDMA descriptors
are 40 bytes and the header is much larger. This avoids doing a
higher order GFP_ATOMIC allocation in edma_prep_slave_sg
when setting up a transfer which can potentially fail due to
fragmentation under heavy I/O load.

The current value of 1024 is unusually high in comparison to
other mmc host drivers which mostly use values of between 1
and 256. The EDMA driver at present splits lists above 20
segments in any case so reducing the size of lists we pass to
it shouldn't add much overhead.
