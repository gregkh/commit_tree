neigh: increase queue_len_bytes to match wmem_default

Florian reported UDP xmit drops that could be root caused to the
too small neigh limit.

Current limit is 64 KB, meaning that even a single UDP socket would hit
it, since its default sk_sndbuf comes from net.core.wmem_default
(~212992 bytes on 64bit arches).

Once ARP/ND resolution is in progress, we should allow a little more
packets to be queued, at least for one producer.

Once neigh arp_queue is filled, a rogue socket should hit its sk_sndbuf
limit and either block in sendmsg() or return -EAGAIN.
