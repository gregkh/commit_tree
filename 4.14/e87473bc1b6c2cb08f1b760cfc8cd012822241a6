IB/hfi1: Only set fd pointer when base context is completely initialized

The allocate_ctxt() function adds the context to the fd data structure.
Since the context is not completely initialized, this can cause confusion
as to whether the context is valid or not.

Move the fd reference from allocate_ctxt() to setup_base_ctxt().
Update the necessary functions to be aware of this move.
