socket, bpf: fix possible use after free

Starting from linux-4.4, 3WHS no longer takes the listener lock.

Since this time, we might hit a use-after-free in sk_filter_charge(),
if the filter we got in the memcpy() of the listener content
just happened to be replaced by a thread changing listener BPF filter.

To fix this, we need to make sure the filter refcount is not already
zero before incrementing it again.
