x86/paravirt/xen: Remove xen_patch()

Xen's paravirt patch function xen_patch() does some special casing for
irq_ops functions to apply relocations when those functions can be
patched inline instead of calls.

Unfortunately none of the special case function replacements is small
enough to be patched inline, so the special case never applies.

As xen_patch() will call paravirt_patch_default() in all cases it can
be just dropped. xen-asm.h doesn't seem necessary without xen_patch()
as the only thing left in it would be the definition of XEN_EFLAGS_NMI
used only once. So move that definition and remove xen-asm.h.
