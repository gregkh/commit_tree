xdp: add bpf_redirect helper function

This adds support for a bpf_redirect helper function to the XDP
infrastructure. For now this only supports redirecting to the egress
path of a port.

In order to support drivers handling a xdp_buff natively this patches
uses a new ndo operation ndo_xdp_xmit() that takes pushes a xdp_buff
to the specified device.

If the program specifies either (a) an unknown device or (b) a device
that does not support the operation a BPF warning is thrown and the
XDP_ABORTED error code is returned.
