media: omap3isp: csiphy: Don't assume the CSI receiver is a CSI2 module

The CSI PHY is associated with a CSI receiver. The code assumes this
receiver is a CSI2 module and relies on the CSI2 module object heavily to
access the ISP or pipeline objects. However, the receiver could also be a
CSI1/CCP2 module.

Pass a new CSI receiver entity pointer to the CSI PHY acquire function, and
replace all hardcoded usage of the CSI2 module with that CSI receiver
entity.
