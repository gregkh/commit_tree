ipv6: fix memory leak with multiple tables during netns destruction

fib6_net_exit only frees the main and local tables. If another table was
created with fib6_alloc_table, we leak it when the netns is destroyed.

Fix this in the same way ip_fib_net_exit cleans up tables, by walking
through the whole hashtable of fib6_table's. We can get rid of the
special cases for local and main, since they're also part of the
hashtable.

Reproducer:
    ip netns add x
    ip -net x -6 rule add from 6003:1::/64 table 100
    ip netns del x
