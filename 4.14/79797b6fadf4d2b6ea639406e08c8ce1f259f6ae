reset: Add a reset controller driver for the Lantiq XWAY based SoCs

The reset controllers (on xRX200 and newer SoCs have two of them) are
provided by the RCU module. This was initially implemented as a simple
reset controller. However, the RCU module provides more functionality
(ethernet GPHYs, USB PHY, etc.), which makes it a MFD device.
The old reset controller driver implementation from
arch/mips/lantiq/xway/reset.c did not honor this fact.

For some devices the request and the status bits are different.
