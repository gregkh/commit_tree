USB: core: Avoid race of async_completed() w/ usbdev_release()

While running reboot tests w/ a specific set of USB devices (and
slub_debug enabled), I found that once every few hours my device would
be crashed with a stack that looked like this:

Investigation using kgdb() found that the wait queue that was passed
into wake_up() had been freed (it was filled with slub_debug poison).

I analyzed and instrumented the code and reproduced.  My current
belief is that this is happening:

1. async_completed() is called (from IRQ).  Moves "as" onto the
   completed list.
2. On another CPU, proc_reapurbnonblock_compat() calls
   async_getcompleted().  Blocks on spinlock.
3. async_completed() releases the lock; keeps running; gets blocked
   midway through wake_up().
4. proc_reapurbnonblock_compat() => async_getcompleted() gets the
   lock; removes "as" from completed list and frees it.
5. usbdev_release() is called.  Frees "ps".
6. async_completed() finally continues running wake_up().  ...but
   wake_up() has a pointer to the freed "ps".

The instrumentation that led me to believe this was based on adding
some trace_printk() calls in a select few functions and then using
kdb's "ftdump" at crash time.  The trace follows (NOTE: in the trace
below I cheated a little bit and added a udelay(1000) in
async_completed() after releasing the spinlock because I wanted it to
trigger quicker):

<...>-2104   0d.h2 13760294us : async_completed before wake_up(): as=ffffffc0cc638200

To fix this problem we can just move the wake_up() under the ps->lock.
There should be no issues there that I'm aware of.
