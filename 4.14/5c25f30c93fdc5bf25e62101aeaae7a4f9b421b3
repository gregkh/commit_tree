ip6_gre: update mtu properly in ip6gre_err

Now when probessing ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG, ip6gre_err only subtracts the
offset of gre header from mtu info. The expected mtu of gre device
should also subtract gre header. Otherwise, the next packets still
can't be sent out.

Jianlin found this issue when using the topo:
  client(ip6gre)<---->(nic1)route(nic2)<----->(ip6gre)server

and reducing nic2's mtu, then both tcp and sctp's performance with
big size data became 0.

This patch is to fix it by also subtracting grehdr (tun->tun_hlen)
from mtu info when updating gre device's mtu in ip6gre_err(). It
also needs to subtract ETH_HLEN if gre dev'type is ARPHRD_ETHER.
