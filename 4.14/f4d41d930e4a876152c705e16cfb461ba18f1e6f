drm/atmel-hlcdc: Handle drm_atomic_helper_swap_state failure

drm_atomic_helper_swap_state() will be changed to interruptible waiting
in the next few commits, so all drivers have to be changed to handling
failure.

Atmel tracks pending commits through dc->commit.pending, so it can
ignore the changes by setting stall = false. We never return failure in
this case, so make failure a BUG_ON.
