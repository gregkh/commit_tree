staging: typec: tcpm: Select default state based on port type

tcpm_default_state wasn't considering the port type when determining the
default role. This change makes tcpm_default_state to consider port type
as well.

tcpm_default_state would return the following based on the port type:
TYPEC_PORT_UFP - SNK_UNATTACHED
TYPEC_PORT_DFP - SRC_UNATTACHED
TYPEC_PORT_DRP - based on the preferred_role setting
