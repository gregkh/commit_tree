tracing/samples: Fix creation and deletion of simple_thread_fn creation

Commit 7496946a8 ("tracing: Add samples of DECLARE_EVENT_CLASS() and
DEFINE_EVENT()") added template examples for all the events. It created a
DEFINE_EVENT_FN() example which reused the foo_bar_reg and foo_bar_unreg
functions.

Enabling both the TRACE_EVENT_FN() and DEFINE_EVENT_FN() example trace
events caused the foo_bar_reg to be called twice, creating the test thread
twice. The foo_bar_unreg would remove it only once, even if it was called
multiple times, leaving a thread existing when the module is unloaded,
causing an oops.

Add a ref count and allow foo_bar_reg() and foo_bar_unreg() be called by
multiple trace events.
