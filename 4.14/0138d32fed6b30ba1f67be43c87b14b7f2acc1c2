Crypto: atmel-ecc: Make a couple of local functions static

Functions atmel_ecc_i2c_client_alloc and atmel_ecc_i2c_client_free are
local to the source and no not need to be in the global scope. Make
them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'atmel_ecc_i2c_client_alloc' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'atmel_ecc_i2c_client_free' was not declared. Should it be static?
