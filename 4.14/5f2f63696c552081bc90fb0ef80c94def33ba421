binder: protect against stale pointers in print_binder_transaction

When printing transactions there were several race conditions
that could cause a stale pointer to be deferenced. Fixed by
reading the pointer once and using it if valid (which is
safe). The transaction buffer also needed protection via proc
lock, so it is only printed if we are holding the correct lock.
