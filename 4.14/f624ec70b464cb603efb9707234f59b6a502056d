usb: misc: lvstest: add entry to place port in compliance mode

Add support for the SuperSpeed Link Layer test case TD.7.34
which requires the operator to place the port into compliance
mode, and to subsequently bring it out via reset. Historically
according to the (now deprecated) USB 3.0 specification a
SuperSpeed host downstream port would automatically transition
to Compliance mode from the Polling state if LFPS polling times
out. However the language in USB 3.1 as well as xHCI 1.1 states
it may be required to explicitly enable this transition. For
such hosts this is done by sending a SET_FEATURE(PORT_LINK_STATE)
with the state set to Compliance to the root hub port.

Similar to the other supported commands, to do this via sysfs:

     echo  > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-0\:1.0/enable_compliance

According to xHCI 1.1 section 4.19.1.2.4.1, this enables the
transition to compliance mode upon LFPS timeout. Note that this
can only be issued when the port is in disconnected state. And
in order to disable this behavior on subsequent transitions, a
warm reset should be issued. So add another entry to do that:

     echo  > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-0\:1.0/warm_reset

In general these attributes can also be useful for other USB
SuperSpeed compliance tests such as electrical and eye diagram
testing which require CPn patterns to be transmitted.
