ACPI/IORT: Fix build regression without IOMMU

A recent change reintroduced a bug that had previously been
fixed by commit d49f2dedf33b ("ACPI/IORT: Fix CONFIG_IOMMU_API
dependency"):

drivers/acpi/arm64/iort.c: In function 'iort_iommu_configure':
drivers/acpi/arm64/iort.c:829:26: error: 'struct iommu_fwspec' has no member named 'ops'

Replace a direct reference to iommu_fwspec->ops with a helper function
call to fix the issue.
