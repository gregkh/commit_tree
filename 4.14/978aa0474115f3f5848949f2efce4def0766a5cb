sctp: fix some type cast warnings introduced since very beginning

These warnings were found by running 'make C=2 M=net/sctp/'.
They are there since very beginning.

Note after this patch, there still one warning left in
sctp_outq_flush():
  sctp_chunk_fail(chunk, SCTP_ERROR_INV_STRM)

Since it has been moved to sctp_stream_outq_migrate on net-next,
to avoid the extra job when merging net-next to net, I will post
the fix for it after the merging is done.
