media: mxl111sf: Fix potential null pointer dereference

Reviewing the delta between cppcheck output of v4.9.39 and v4.9.40
stable updates, I stumbled on the new warning:

mxl111sf.c:80: (warning) Possible null pointer dereference: rbuf

Since copying state->rcvbuf into rbuf is not needed in the 'write-only'
scenario (i.e. calling mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() from mxl111sf_i2c_send_data()
or from mxl111sf_write_reg()), bypass memcpy() in this case.

Fixes: d90b336f3f65 ("[media] mxl111sf: Fix driver to use heap allocate buffers for USB messages")
