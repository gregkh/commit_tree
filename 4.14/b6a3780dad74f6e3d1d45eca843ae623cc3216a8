efi/reboot: Fall back to original power-off method if EFI_RESET_SHUTDOWN returns

Commit:

  44be28e9dd98 ("x86/reboot: Add EFI reboot quirk for ACPI Hardware Reduced flag")

sets pm_power_off to efi_power_off() when the acpi_gbl_reduced_hardware
flag is set.

According to its commit message this is necessary because: "BayTrail-T
class of hardware requires EFI in order to powerdown and reboot and no
other reliable method exists".

But I have a Bay Trail CR tablet where the EFI_RESET_SHUTDOWN call does
not work, it simply returns without doing anything (AFAICT).

So it seems that some Bay Trail devices must use EFI for power-off, while
for others only ACPI works.

Note that efi_power_off() only gets used if the platform code defines
efi_poweroff_required() and that returns true, this currently only ever
happens on x86.

Since on the devices which need ACPI for power-off the EFI_RESET_SHUTDOWN
call simply returns, this patch makes the efi-reboot code remember the
old pm_power_off handler and if EFI_RESET_SHUTDOWN returns it falls back
to calling that.

This seems preferable to dmi-quirking our way out of this, since there
are likely quite a few devices suffering from this.
