arm64: cleanup {COMPAT_,}SET_PERSONALITY() macro

There is some work that should be done after setting the personality.
Currently it's done in the macro, which is not the best idea.

In this patch new arch_setup_new_exec() routine is introduced, and all
setup code is moved there, as suggested by Catalin:
