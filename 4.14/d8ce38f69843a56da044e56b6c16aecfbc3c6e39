sh: sh7757: remove nonexistent GPIO_PT[JLNQ]7_RESV to fix pinctrl registration

Commit 3810e96056ff ("sh: modify pinmux for SH7757 2nd cut") renamed
GPIO_PT[JLNQ]7 to GPIO_PT[JLNQ]7_RESV, and removed the existing users
from the pinmux_pins[] array.

However, pinmux_pins[] is initialized through PINMUX_GPIO(), using
designated array initializers, where the GPIO_* enums serve as indices.
Hence entries were not really removed, but replaced by (zero-filled)
holes.  Such entries are treated as pin zero, which was registered
before, thus leading to pinctrl registration failures, as seen on
sh7722:

    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: pin 0 already registered
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: error during pin registration
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: could not register: -22
    sh-pfc: probe of pfc-sh7722 failed with error -22

Remove GPIO_PT[JLNQ]7_RESV from the enum to fix this.
