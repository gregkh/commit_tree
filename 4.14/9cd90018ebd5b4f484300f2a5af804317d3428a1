drm/i915: Cancel pending execlists irq handler upon idling

Due to the slight asynchronicity in handling the execlists interrupts
(i.e. we defer the work to a handler that may consume more than one
interrupt event), when the engine is idle we may still have an irq
tasklet queued (especially when it has been deferred to a ksoftirqd).
At the beginning of the tasklet, we assert that we do hold a device
wakeref for the access we are about to perform. This assumes that when
we idle and release the GT wakeref, all execlists work has been
completed (since the elsp tracking says the hw is idle). However, there
may still be a tasklet queued, so as we mark the engine idle, also
cancel any pending tasklet.
