genirq/debugfs: Triggering of interrupts from userspace

When developing new (and therefore buggy) interrupt related
code, it can sometimes be useful to inject interrupts without
having to rely on a device to actually generate them.

This functionnality relies either on the irqchip driver to
expose a irq_set_irqchip_state(IRQCHIP_STATE_PENDING) callback,
or on the core code to be able to retrigger a (edge-only)
interrupt.

To use this feature:

echo -n trigger > /sys/kernel/debug/irq/irqs/IRQNUM

WARNING: This is DANGEROUS, and strictly a debug feature.
Do not use it on a production system. Your HW is likely to
catch fire, your data to be corrupted, and reporting this will
make you look an even bigger fool than the idiot who wrote
this patch.
