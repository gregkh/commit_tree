arm64: add on_accessible_stack()

Both unwind_frame() and dump_backtrace() try to check whether a stack
address is sane to access, with very similar logic. Both will need
updating in order to handle overflow stacks.

Factor out this logic into a helper, so that we can avoid further
duplication when we add overflow stacks.
