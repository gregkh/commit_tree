NFSv4: Fix up mirror allocation

There are a number of callers of nfs_pageio_complete() that want to
continue using the nfs_pageio_descriptor without needing to call
nfs_pageio_init() again. Examples include nfs_pageio_resend() and
nfs_pageio_cond_complete().

The problem is that nfs_pageio_complete() also calls
nfs_pageio_cleanup_mirroring(), which frees up the array of mirrors.
This can lead to writeback errors, in the next call to
nfs_pageio_setup_mirroring().

Fix by simply moving the allocation of the mirrors to
nfs_pageio_setup_mirroring().
