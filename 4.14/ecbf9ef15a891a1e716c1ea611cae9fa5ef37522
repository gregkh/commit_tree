dmaengine: bcm-sba-raid: Remove redundant SBA_REQUEST_STATE_COMPLETED

The SBA_REQUEST_STATE_COMPLETED state was added to keep track
of sba_request which got completed but cannot be freed because
underlying Async Tx descriptor was not ACKed by DMA client.

Instead of above, we can free the sba_request with non-ACKed
Async Tx descriptor and sba_alloc_request() will ensure that
it always allocates sba_request with ACKed Async Tx descriptor.
This alternate approach makes SBA_REQUEST_STATE_COMPLETED state
redundant hence this patch removes it.
