exec: load_script: kill the onstack interp[BINPRM_BUF_SIZE] array

Patch series "exec: binfmt_misc: fix use-after-free, kill
iname[BINPRM_BUF_SIZE]".

It looks like this code was always wrong, then commit 948b701a607f
("binfmt_misc: add persistent opened binary handler for containers")
added more problems.

This patch (of 6):

load_script() can simply use i_name instead, it points into bprm->buf[]
and nobody can change this memory until we call prepare_binprm().

The only complication is that we need to also change the signature of
bprm_change_interp() but this change looks good too.

While at it, do whitespace/style cleanups.

NOTE: the real motivation for this change is that people want to
increase BINPRM_BUF_SIZE, we need to change load_misc_binary() too but
this looks more complicated because afaics it is very buggy.
