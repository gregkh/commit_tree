nullb: add configfs interface

Add configfs interface for nullb. configfs interface is more flexible
and easy to configure in a per-disk basis.

Configuration is something like this:
mount -t configfs none /mnt

Checking which features the driver supports:
cat /mnt/nullb/features

The 'features' attribute is for future extension. We probably will add
new features into the driver, userspace can check this attribute to find
the supported features.

Create/remove a device:
mkdir/rmdir /mnt/nullb/a

Then configure the device by setting attributes under /mnt/nullb/a, most
of nullb supported module parameters are converted to attributes:
size; /* device size in MB */
completion_nsec; /* time in ns to complete a request */
submit_queues; /* number of submission queues */
home_node; /* home node for the device */
queue_mode; /* block interface */
blocksize; /* block size */
irqmode; /* IRQ completion handler */
hw_queue_depth; /* queue depth */
use_lightnvm; /* register as a LightNVM device */
blocking; /* blocking blk-mq device */
use_per_node_hctx; /* use per-node allocation for hardware context */

Note, creating a device doesn't create a disk immediately. Creating a
disk is done in two phases: create a device and then power on the
device. Next patch will introduce device power on.
