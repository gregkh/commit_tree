tty: goldfish: Refactor constants to better reflect their nature

Classify constants GOLDFISH_TTY_xxx into two groups: command ids and
register offsets. Apply different naming for register offsets (add
'REG_' after 'GOLDFISH_TTY_' in constant names). Change implementation
to use preprocessor's '#define' statements instead of 'enum'
declaration (as this is more common way of implementation in such
cases).

This makes the driver code easier to follow and hopefully prevents
future bugs.
