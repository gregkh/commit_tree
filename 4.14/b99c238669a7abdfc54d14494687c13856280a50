dmaengine: bcm-sba-raid: Remove redundant SBA_REQUEST_STATE_RECEIVED

The SBA_REQUEST_STATE_RECEIVED state is now redundant because
received sba_request are immediately freed or moved to completed
list in sba_process_received_request().

This patch removes redundant SBA_REQUEST_STATE_RECEIVED state.
