RDMA/netlink: Rename netlink callback struct

The RDMA netlink client infrastructure was removed and made obsolete.
The old infrastructure defined struct ibnl_client_cbs. Now that all
uses of this have been updated to the new infrastructure, rename the
struct to be compliant with the current stack naming standards:
struct rdma_nl_cbs.
