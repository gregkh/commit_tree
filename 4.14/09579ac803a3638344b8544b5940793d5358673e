net/smc: add missing dev_put

In the infiniband part, SMC currently uses get_netdev which calls
dev_hold on the returned net device. However, the SMC code never calls
dev_put on that net device resulting in a wrong reference count.

This patch adds a dev_put after the usage of the net device to fix the
issue.
