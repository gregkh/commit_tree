xfs: consolidate the various page fault handlers

Add a new __xfs_filemap_fault helper that implements all four page fault
callouts, and make these methods themselves small stubs that set the
correct write_fault flag, and exit early for the non-DAX case for the
hugepage related ones.

Also remove the extra size checking in the pfn_fault path, which is now
handled in the core DAX code.

Life would be so much simpler if we only had one method for all this.
