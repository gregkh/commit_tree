scsi: zfcp: Remove unneeded linux/miscdevice.h include

drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_aux.c does not contain any miscdevice so the
inclusion of linux/miscdevice.h is unnecessary.

[maier@linux.vnet.ibm.com: just for the records, this is in fact a
 minor missing code cleanup of the following older "feature"
 which also dropped the only former use of a misc device in zfcp:
 commit 663e0890e31c ("[SCSI] zfcp: remove access control tables
				    interface")
 commit b5dc3c4800cc ("[SCSI] zfcp: remove access control tables
				    interface (keep sysfs files)")
 commit 1b33ef23946a ("zfcp: remove access control tables interface
			     (port leftovers)")]
