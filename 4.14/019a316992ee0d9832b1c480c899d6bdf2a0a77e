rtnetlink: add reference counting to prevent module unload while dump is in progress

I don't see what prevents rmmod (unregister_all is called) while a dump
is active.

Even if we'd add rtnl lock/unlock pair to unregister_all (as done here),
thats not enough either as rtnl_lock is released right before the dump
process starts.

So this adds a refcount:
 * acquire rtnl mutex
 * bump refcount
 * release mutex
 * start the dump

... and make unregister_all remove the callbacks (no new dumps possible)
and then wait until refcount is 0.
