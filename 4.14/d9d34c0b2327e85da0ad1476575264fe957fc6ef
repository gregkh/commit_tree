nvme-fc: use transport-specific sgl format

Sync with NVM Express spec change and FC-NVME 1.18.

FC transport sets SGL type to Transport SGL Data Block Descriptor and
subtype to transport-specific value 0x0A.

Removed the warn-on's on the PRP fields. They are unneeded. They were
to check for values from the upper layer that weren't set right, and
for the most part were fine. But, with Async events, which reuse the
same structure and 2nd time issued the SGL overlay converted them to
the Transport SGL values - the warn-on's were errantly firing.
