IB/core: Fix typo in the name of the tag-matching cap struct

The tag matching functionality is implemented by mlx5 driver
by extending XRQ, however this internal kernel information was
exposed to user space applications with *xrq* name instead of *tm*.

This patch renames *xrq* to *tm* to handle that.
