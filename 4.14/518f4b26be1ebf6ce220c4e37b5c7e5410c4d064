media: rc-core: rename input_name to device_name

When an ir-spi is registered, you get this message.

rc rc0: Unspecified device as /devices/platform/soc/3f215080.spi/spi_master/spi32766/spi32766.128/rc/rc0

"Unspecified device" refers to input_name, which makes no sense for IR
TX only devices. So, rename to device_name.

Also make driver_name const char* so that no casts are needed anywhere.

Now ir-spi reports:

rc rc0: IR SPI as /devices/platform/soc/3f215080.spi/spi_master/spi32766/spi32766.128/rc/rc0
