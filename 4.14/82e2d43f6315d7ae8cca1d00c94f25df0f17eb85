rtc: ds1307: improve irq setup

Change the usage of variable want_irq to reflect its name. Don't set
it to true in case wakeup is enabled but no interrupt number is given.
In addition set variable ds1307_can_wakeup_device if chip->alarm
is set only.
This allows to simplify the code and make it better understandable.
