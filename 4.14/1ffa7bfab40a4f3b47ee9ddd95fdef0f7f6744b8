drbd: mark symbols static where possible

We get a few warnings when building kernel with W=1:
drbd/drbd_receiver.c:1224:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'one_flush_endio' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drbd/drbd_req.c:1450:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'send_and_submit_pending' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drbd/drbd_main.c:924:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'assign_p_sizes_qlim' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
....

In fact, these functions are only used in the file in which they are
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
So this patch marks these functions with 'static'.
