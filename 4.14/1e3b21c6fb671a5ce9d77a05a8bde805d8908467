dm integrity: optimize writing dm-bufio buffers that are partially changed

Rather than write the entire dm-bufio buffer when only a subset is
changed, improve dm-bufio (and dm-integrity) by only writing the subset
of the buffer that changed.

Update dm-integrity to make use of dm-bufio's new
dm_bufio_mark_partial_buffer_dirty() interface.
