media: staging: atomisp: ov5693: constify acpi_device_id

acpi_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with acpi_device_id provided by <acpi/acpi_bus.h> work with
const acpi_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  20729	   3264	      0	  23993	   5db9
drivers/staging/media/atomisp/i2c/ov5693/ov5693.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  20793	   3200	      0	  23993	   5db9
