ASoC: samsung: make tm2_dapm_widgets and tm2_pm_ops static

tm2_dapm_widgets and tm2_pm_ops are local to the source and do not need
to be in global scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'tm2_dapm_widgets' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'tm2_pm_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
