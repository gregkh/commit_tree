platform/x86: dell-wmi: Fix driver interface version query

When I converted dell-wmi to the new bus infrastructure, I left the
call to dell_wmi_check_descriptor_buffer() in dell_wmi_init().  This
could cause two problems:

 - An error message when loading the driver on a system without
   dell-wmi.  We'd try to read the event descriptor even if the WMI
   GUID wasn't there.

 - A possible race if dell-wmi was loaded manually before wmi was
   fully initialized.

Fix it by moving the call to the probe function where it belongs.
