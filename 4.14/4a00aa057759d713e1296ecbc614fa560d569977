MIPS,bpf: fix missing break in switch statement

There is a missing break causing a fall-through and setting
ctx.use_bbit_insns to the wrong value. Fix this by adding the
missing break.

Detected with cppcheck:
"Variable 'ctx.use_bbit_insns' is reassigned a value before the old
one has been used. 'break;' missing?"
