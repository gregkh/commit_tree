btrfs: account for pinned bytes in should_alloc_chunk

In a heavy write scenario, we can end up with a large number of pinned bytes.
This can translate into (very) premature ENOSPC because pinned bytes
must be accounted for when allowing a reservation but aren't accounted for
when deciding whether to create a new chunk.

This patch adds the accounting to should_alloc_chunk so that we can
create the chunk.
