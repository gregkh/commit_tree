staging: lustre: linkea: linkEA size limitation

Under DNE mode, if we do not restrict the linkEA size, and if there
are too many cross-MDTs hard links to the same object, then it will
cause the llog overflow. On the other hand, too many linkEA entries
in the linkEA will serious affect the linkEA performance because we
only support to locate linkEA entry consecutively.

So we need to restrict the linkEA size. Currently, it is 4096 bytes,
that is independent from the backend. If too many hard links caused
the linkEA overflowed, we will add overflow timestamp in the linkEA
header.
