net: mvpp2: initialize the XLG MAC when using a port

This adds a routine to initialize the XLG MAC at the port level when
using a port and the XAUI/10GKR interface mode. This wasn't done until
this commit, and the mvpp2 driver was relying on the bootloader/firmware
initialization. This doesn't mean everything is configured in the mvpp2
driver now, but it helps reducing the gap.
