mm, swap: don't use VMA based swap readahead if HDD is used as swap

VMA based swap readahead will readahead the virtual pages that is
continuous in the virtual address space.  While the original swap
readahead will readahead the swap slots that is continuous in the swap
device.  Although VMA based swap readahead is more correct for the swap
slots to be readahead, it will trigger more small random readings, which
may cause the performance of HDD (hard disk) to degrade heavily, and may
finally exceed the benefit.

To avoid the issue, in this patch, if the HDD is used as swap, the VMA
based swap readahead will be disabled, and the original swap readahead
will be used instead.
