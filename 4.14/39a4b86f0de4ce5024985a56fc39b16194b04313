net/mlx5e/core/en_fs: fix pointer dereference after free in mlx5e_execute_l2_action

hn is being kfree'd in mlx5e_del_l2_from_hash and then dereferenced
by accessing hn->ai.addr

Fix this by copying the MAC address into a local variable for its safe use
in all possible execution paths within function mlx5e_execute_l2_action.
