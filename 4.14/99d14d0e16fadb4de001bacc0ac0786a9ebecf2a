cpufreq: Process remote callbacks from any CPU if the platform permits

On many platforms, CPUs can do DVFS across cpufreq policies. i.e CPU
from policy-A can change frequency of CPUs belonging to policy-B.

This is quite common in case of ARM platforms where we don't
configure any per-cpu register.

Add a flag to identify such platforms and update
cpufreq_can_do_remote_dvfs() to allow remote callbacks if this flag is
set.

Also enable the flag for cpufreq-dt driver which is used only on ARM
platforms currently.
