staging: ks7010: Fix cast to restricted __le16 in ks_wlan_net.c

This patch fixes the following Sparse warnings in ks_wlan_net.c:
drivers/staging/ks7010/ks_wlan_net.c:1359:24: warning: cast to restricted __le16
link_ap_info_t structure field 'capability' has native order and is used everywhere
in the code in such way (i.e get_ap_information, get_current_ap). Both sides of
assignment are u16 (native order) so 'le16_to_cpu' is not needed and wrong.
