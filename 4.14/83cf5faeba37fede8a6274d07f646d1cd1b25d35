pinctrl: msm: add support to configure ipq40xx GPIO_PULL bits

GPIO_PULL bits configurations in TLMM_GPIO_CFG register
differs for IPQ40xx from rest of the other qcom SoCs.
As it does not support the keeper state and therefore can't
support bias-bus-hold property.

This patch adds a pull_no_keeper setting which configures the
msm_gpio_pull bits for ipq40xx. This is required to fix the
proper configurations of gpio-pull bits for nand pins mux.

IPQ40xx SoC:
2'b10: Internal pull up enable.
2'b11: Unsupport

For other SoC's:
2'b10: Keeper
2'b11: Pull-Up

Note: Due to pull_no_keeper length, all kerneldoc entries
in the msm_pinctrl_soc_data struct had to be realigned.
