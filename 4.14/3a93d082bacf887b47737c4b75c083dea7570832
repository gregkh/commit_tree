ALSA: firewire-motu: add support for MOTU Audio Express

MOTU Audio Express is one of third generation in MOTU FireWire
series, produced in 2011. This model consists of three chips:
 * TI TSB41AB2 (Physical layer for IEEE 1394 bus)
 * Microchip USB3300 (Hi-Speed USB Device with ULPI interface)
 * Xilinx Spartan-3A FPGA, XC3S400A (Link layer for IEEE 1394 bus, packet
   processing and data block processing layer)

This commit adds support for this model. As I expected, it works with
current implementaion of protocol version 3. On the other hand, the unit
has a quirk to request subaction originated by any driver.

In 1394 OHCI (rev.1.1), after OUTPUT_LAST* descriptors is processed,
'xferStaus' field is filled with 'ContextControl[0:15]' (see clause 7.1.3).
5 bits in LSB side of the field has ack code in acknowledge from the unit
(see clause 7.2.2). A list of the code is shown in Table 3-2.

As long as I investigated, in a case of the '-reserved-' acknowledge
message from the unit, the field has 0x10. On the table, this value is
'Reserved for definition by future 1394 standards'. As long as I know,
any specifications of IEEE 1394 has no such extensions, thus the unit is
out of specification. Besides, I note that the unit does not always
acknowledge with the invalid code. I guess this is a bug of firmware. I
confirmed the bug in firmware version 1.04 and this is the latest one.
