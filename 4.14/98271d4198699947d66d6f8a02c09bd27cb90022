powerpc/powernv/vas: Define vas_win_close() interface

Define the vas_win_close() interface which should be used to close a
send or receive windows.

While the hardware configurations required to open send and receive
windows differ, the configuration to close a window is the same for
both. So we use a single interface to close the window.
