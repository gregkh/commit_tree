iwlwifi: implement fseq version mismatch warning

During init, the FW checks whether the FSEQ value matches what it
expects.  If it doesn't match, we print a warning to let integrators
clearly know that something is wrong.  This can happen if another core
(i.e. not WiFi) has updated the FSEQ version.  This notification is
only sent by the FW in production, for development firmwares, an
assertion is triggered instead.
