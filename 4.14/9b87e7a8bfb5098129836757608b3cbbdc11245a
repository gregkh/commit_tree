KVM: arm/arm64: Support uaccess of GICC_APRn

When migrating guests around we need to know the active priorities to
ensure functional virtual interrupt prioritization by the GIC.

This commit clarifies the API and how active priorities of interrupts in
different groups are represented, and implements the accessor functions
for the uaccess register range.

We live with a slight layering violation in accessing GICv3 data
structures from vgic-mmio-v2.c, because anything else just adds too much
complexity for us to deal with (it's not like there's a benefit
elsewhere in the code of an intermediate representation as is the case
with the VMCR).  We accept this, because while doing v3 processing from
a file named something-v2.c can look strange at first, this really is
specific to dealing with the user space interface for something that
looks like a GICv2.
