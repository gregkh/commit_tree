f2fs: hurry up to issue discard after io interruption

Once we encounter I/O interruption during issuing discards, we will delay
long time before next round, but if system status is I/O idle during the
time, it may loses opportunity to issue discards. So this patch changes
to hurry up to issue discard after io interruption.

Besides, this patch also fixes to issue discards accurately with assigned
rate.
