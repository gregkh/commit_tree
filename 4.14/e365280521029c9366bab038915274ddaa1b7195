lan78xx: Use default values loaded from EEPROM/OTP after reset

Use default value of auto duplex and auto speed values loaded
from EEPROM/OTP after reset. The LAN78xx allows platform
configurations to be loaded from EEPROM/OTP.
Ex: When external phy is connected, the MAC can be configured to
have correct auto speed, auto duplex, auto polarity configured
from the EEPROM/OTP.
