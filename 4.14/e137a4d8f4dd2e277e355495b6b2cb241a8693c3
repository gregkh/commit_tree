x86/switch_to/64: Rewrite FS/GS switching yet again to fix AMD CPUs

Switching FS and GS is a mess, and the current code is still subtly
wrong: it assumes that "Loading a nonzero value into FS sets the
index and base", which is false on AMD CPUs if the value being
loaded is 1, 2, or 3.

(The current code came from commit 3e2b68d752c9 ("x86/asm,
sched/x86: Rewrite the FS and GS context switch code"), which made
it better but didn't fully fix it.)

Rewrite it to be much simpler and more obviously correct.  This
should fix it fully on AMD CPUs and shouldn't adversely affect
performance.
