x86/intel_rdt: Introduce a common compile option for RDT

We currently have a CONFIG_RDT_A which is for RDT(Resource directory
technology) allocation based resctrl filesystem interface. As a
preparation to add support for RDT monitoring as well into the same
resctrl filesystem, change the config option to be CONFIG_RDT which
would include both RDT allocation and monitoring code.

No functional change.
