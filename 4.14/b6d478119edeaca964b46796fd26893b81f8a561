scsi: smartpqi: update kexec and power down support

Add PQI reset to driver shutdown callback to work around controller bug.

During an 1.) OS shutdown or 2.) kexec outside of a kdump, the Linux
kernel will clear BME on our controller.

If BME is cleared during a controller/host PCIe transfer, the controller
will lock up.

So we perform a PQI reset in the driver's shutdown callback function to
eliminate the possibility of a controller/host PCIe transfer being
active when the kernel clears BME immediately after calling the driver's
shutdown callback.
