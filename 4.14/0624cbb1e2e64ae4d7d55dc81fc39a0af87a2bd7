scsi: sd: sr: Convert two assignments into warning statements

Before scsi_prep_fn() calls the ULP .init_command() callback
function it stores the SCSI command pointer in request.special.
This means that the SCpnt = rq->special assignments in the sd
and sr drivers assign a pointer to itself. Hence convert these
two assignment statements into warning statements.
