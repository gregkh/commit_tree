arm64: hugetlb: Cleanup setup_hugepagesz

Replace a lot of if statements with switch and case labels to make it
much clearer which huge page sizes are supported.

Also, we prevent PUD_SIZE from being used on systems not running with
4KB PAGE_SIZE. Before if one supplied PUD_SIZE in these circumstances,
then unusuable huge page sizes would be in use.
