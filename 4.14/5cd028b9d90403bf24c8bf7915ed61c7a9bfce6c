arm64: Re-enable support for contiguous hugepages

also known as -

Revert "Revert "Revert "commit 66b3923a1a0f ("arm64: hugetlb: add
support for PTE contiguous bit")"""

Now that our hugetlb implementation is compliant with the
break-before-make requirements of the architecture and we have addressed
some of the issues in core code required for properly dealing with
hardware poisoning of contiguous hugepages let's re-enable support for
contiguous hugepages.

This reverts commit 6ae979ab39a368c18ceb0424bf824d172d6ab56f.
