net/mlx5: Don't store reserved part in FTEs and FGs

The current code stores fte_match_param in the software representation
of FTEs and FGs. fte_match_param contains a large reserved area at the
bottom of the struct. Since downstream patches are going to hash this
part, we would like to avoid doing so on a reserved part.
