fscache: fix fscache_objlist_show format processing

gcc points out a minor bug in the handling of unknown cookie types,
which could result in a string overflow when the integer is copied into
a 3-byte string:

  fs/fscache/object-list.c: In function 'fscache_objlist_show':
  fs/fscache/object-list.c:265:19: error: 'sprintf' may write a terminating nul past the end of the destination [-Werror=format-overflow=]
   sprintf(_type, "%02u", cookie->def->type);
                  ^~~~~~
  fs/fscache/object-list.c:265:4: note: 'sprintf' output between 3 and 4 bytes into a destination of size 3

This is currently harmless as no code sets a type other than 0 or 1, but
it makes sense to use snprintf() here to avoid overflowing the array if
that changes.
