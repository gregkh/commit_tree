libnvdimm, pfn, dax: limit namespace alignments to the supported set

Now that we properly advertise the supported pte, pmd, and pud sizes,
restrict the supported alignments that can be set on a namespace. This
assumes that userspace was not previously relying on the ability to set
odd alignments. At least ndctl only ever supported setting the namespace
alignment to 4K, 2M, or 1G.
