mm: meminit: mark init_reserved_page as __meminit

The function is called from __meminit context and calls other __meminit
functions but isn't it self mark as such today:

  WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x4516): Section mismatch in reference from the function init_reserved_page() to the function .meminit.text:early_pfn_to_nid()
  The function init_reserved_page() references the function __meminit early_pfn_to_nid().
  This is often because init_reserved_page lacks a __meminit annotation or the annotation of early_pfn_to_nid is wrong.

On most compilers, we don't notice this because the function gets
inlined all the time.  Adding __meminit here fixes the harmless warning
for the old versions and is generally the correct annotation.
