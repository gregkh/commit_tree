net: export some generic xdp helpers

This patch tries to export some generic xdp helpers to drivers. This
can let driver to do XDP for a specific skb. This is useful for the
case when the packet is hard to be processed at page level directly
(e.g jumbo/GSO frame).

With this patch, there's no need for driver to forbid the XDP set when
configuration is not suitable. Instead, it can defer the XDP for
packets that is hard to be processed directly after skb is created.
