remoteproc: Introduce rproc handle accessor for children

In certain circumstances rpmsg devices needs to acquire a handle to the
ancestor remoteproc instance, e.g. to invoke rproc_report_crash() when a
fatal error is detected. Introduce an interface that walks the device
tree in search for a remoteproc instance and return this.
