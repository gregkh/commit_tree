mm/mlock.c: use page_zone() instead of page_zone_id()

page_zone_id() is a specialized function to compare the zone for the pages
that are within the section range.  If the section of the pages are
different, page_zone_id() can be different even if their zone is the same.
This wrong usage doesn't cause any actual problem since
__munlock_pagevec_fill() would be called again with failed index.
However, it's better to use more appropriate function here.
