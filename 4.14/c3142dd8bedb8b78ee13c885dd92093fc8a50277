power: supply: Add power_supply_set_input_current_limit_from_supplier helper

On some devices the USB Type-C port power (USB PD 2.0) negotiation is
done by a separate port-controller IC, while the current limit is
controlled through another (charger) IC.

It has been decided to model this by modelling the external Type-C
power brick (adapter/charger) as a power-supply class device which
supplies the charger-IC, with its voltage-now and current-max representing
the negotiated voltage and max current draw.

This commit adds a power_supply_set_input_current_limit_from_supplier
helper function which charger power-supply drivers can call to get
the max-current from their supplier and have this applied
through their set_property call-back to their input-current-limit.
