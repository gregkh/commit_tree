drm/i915: Check execlist/ring status during hangcheck

Before we declare an engine as idle, check if there are any pending
execlist context-switches and if the ring itself reports as idle.
Otherwise, we may be left in a situation where we miss a crucial
execlist event (or something more sinister) yet the requests complete.
Since the seqno write happens, we believe the engine to be truly idle.
