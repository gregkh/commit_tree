ipv6: sr: add helper functions for seg6local

This patch adds three helper functions to be used with the seg6local packet
processing actions.

The decap_and_validate() function will be used by the End.D* actions, that
decapsulate an SR-enabled packet.

The advance_nextseg() function applies the fundamental operations to update
an SRH for the next segment.

The lookup_nexthop() function helps select the next-hop for the processed
SR packets. It supports an optional next-hop address to route the packet
specifically through it, and an optional routing table to use.
