x86/intel_rdt: Show bitmask of shareable resource with other executing units

CPUID.(EAX=0x10, ECX=res#):EBX[31:0] reports a bit mask for a resource.
Each set bit within the length of the CBM indicates the corresponding
unit of the resource allocation may be used by other entities in the
platform (e.g. an integrated graphics engine or hardware units outside
the processor core and have direct access to the resource). Each
cleared bit within the length of the CBM indicates the corresponding
allocation unit can be configured to implement a priority-based
allocation scheme without interference with other hardware agents in
the system. Bits outside the length of the CBM are reserved.

More details on the bit mask are described in x86 Software Developer's
Manual.

The bitmask is shown in "info" directory for each resource. It's
up to user to decide how to use the bitmask within a CBM in a partition
to share or isolate a resource with other executing units.
