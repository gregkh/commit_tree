KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix H_REGISTER_VPA VPA size validation

KVM currently validates the size of the VPA registered by the client
against sizeof(struct lppaca), however we align (and therefore size)
that struct to 1kB to avoid crossing a 4kB boundary in the client.

PAPR calls for sizes >= 640 bytes to be accepted. Hard code this with
a comment.
