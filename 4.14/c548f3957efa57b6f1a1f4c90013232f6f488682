Drivers: hv: balloon: Initialize last_post_time on startup

When left uninitialized, this sometimes fails the following check in
post_status():

	if (!time_after(now, (last_post_time + HZ))) {
		return;
        }

This causes unnecessary delays in reporting memory pressure to host after
booting up.
