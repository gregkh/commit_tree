Revert "apparmor: add base infastructure for socket mediation"

This reverts commit 651e28c5537abb39076d3949fb7618536f1d242e.

This caused a regression:
 "The specific problem is that dnsmasq refuses to start on openSUSE Leap
  42.2.  The specific cause is that and attempt to open a PF_LOCAL socket
  gets EACCES.  This means that networking doesn't function on a system
  with a 4.14-rc2 system."

Sadly, the developers involved seemed to be in denial for several weeks
about this, delaying the revert.  This has not been a good release for
the security subsystem, and this area needs to change development
practices.
