percpu: update free path to take advantage of contig hints

The bitmap allocator must keep metadata consistent. The easiest way is
to scan after every allocation for each affected block and the entire
chunk. This is rather expensive.

The free path can take advantage of current contig hints to prevent
scanning within the start and end block.  If a scan is needed, it can
be done by scanning backwards from the start and forwards from the end
to identify the entire free area this can be combined with. The blocks
can then be updated by some basic checks rather than complete block
scans.

A chunk scan happens when the freed area makes a page free, a block
free, or spans across blocks. This is necessary as the contig hint at
this point could span across blocks. The check uses the minimum of page
size and the block size to allow for variable sized blocks. There is a
tradeoff here with not updating after every free. It is possible a
contig hint in one block can be merged with the contig hint in the next
block. This means the contig hint can be off by up to a page. However,
if the chunk's contig hint is contained in one block, the contig hint
will be accurate.
