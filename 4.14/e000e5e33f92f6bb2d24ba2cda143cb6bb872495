perf trace: Remove F_ from some of the fcntl command strings

The initial ones already had that "F_" prefix stripped to make things
shorter, some hadn't, do it now.

We do this to make the 'perf trace' output more compact. At some point
perhaps the best thing to do is to have the tool do this stripping
automatically, letting the user also decide if this is to be done or
not. For now, be consistent.
