x86/intel_rdt/cqm: Add mon_data

Add a mon_data directory for the root rdtgroup and all other rdtgroups.
The directory holds all of the monitored data for all domains and events
of all resources being monitored.

The mon_data itself has a list of directories in the format
mon_<domain_name>_<domain_id>. Each of these subdirectories contain one
file per event in the mode "0444". Reading the file displays a snapshot
of the monitored data for the event the file represents.

For ex, on a 2 socket Broadwell with llc_occupancy being
monitored the mon_data contents look as below:

$ ls /sys/fs/resctrl/p1/mon_data/
mon_L3_00
mon_L3_01

Each domain directory has one file per event:
$ ls /sys/fs/resctrl/p1/mon_data/mon_L3_00/
llc_occupancy

To read current llc_occupancy of ctrl_mon group p1
$ cat /sys/fs/resctrl/p1/mon_data/mon_L3_00/llc_occupancy
33789096

[This patch idea is based on Tony's sample patches to organise data in a
per domain directory and have one file per event (and use the fp->priv to
store mon data bits)]
