arm64: dts: marvell: fix interrupt-map property for Armada CP110 PCIe controller

The interrupt-map property used in the description of the Marvell
Armada 7K/8K PCIe controllers has a bogus extraneous 0 that causes the
interrupt conversion to not be done properly. This causes the PCIe PME
and AER root port service drivers to fail their initialization:

[    5.019900] genirq: Setting trigger mode 7 for irq 114 failed (irq_chip_set_type_parent+0x0/0x30)
[    5.028821] pcie_pme: probe of 0001:00:00.0:pcie001 failed with error -22
[    5.035687] genirq: Setting trigger mode 7 for irq 114 failed (irq_chip_set_type_parent+0x0/0x30)
[    5.044614] aer: probe of 0001:00:00.0:pcie002 failed with error -22

This problem was introduced when the interrupt description was
switched from using the GIC directly to using the ICU interrupt
controller. Indeed, the GIC has address-cells = <1>, which requires a
parent unit address, while the ICU has address-cells = <0>.
