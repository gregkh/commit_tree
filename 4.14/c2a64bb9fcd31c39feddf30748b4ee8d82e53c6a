net: compat: assert the size of cmsg copied in is as expected

The actual length of cmsg fetched in during the second loop
(i.e., kcmsg - kcmsg_base) could be different from what we
get from the first loop (i.e., kcmlen).

The main reason is that the two get_user() calls in the two
loops (i.e., get_user(ucmlen, &ucmsg->cmsg_len) and
__get_user(ucmlen, &ucmsg->cmsg_len)) could cause ucmlen
to have different values even they fetch from the same userspace
address, as user can race to change the memory content in
&ucmsg->cmsg_len across fetches.

Although in the second loop, the sanity check
if ((char *)kcmsg_base + kcmlen - (char *)kcmsg < CMSG_ALIGN(tmp))
is inplace, it only ensures that the cmsg fetched in during the
second loop does not exceed the length of kcmlen, but not
necessarily equal to kcmlen. But indicated by the assignment
kmsg->msg_controllen = kcmlen, we should enforce that.

This patch adds this additional sanity check and ensures that
what is recorded in kmsg->msg_controllen is the actual cmsg length.
