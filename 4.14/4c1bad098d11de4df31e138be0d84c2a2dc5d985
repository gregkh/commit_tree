ARM: dts: imx6qdl-nitrogen6x: fix USB PHY reset

Declared as a regulator since the driver doesn't have a reset-gpios
property for this.

This ensures that the PHY is woken up, not depending on the state the
second stage bootloader leaves the pin.

This is a workaround until a proper mechanism is provided to reset such
devices like the pwrseq library [1] for instance.
