KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Hold kvm->lock around call to kvmppc_update_lpcr

Commit 468808bd35c4 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Set process table for HPT
guests on POWER9", 2017-01-30) added a call to kvmppc_update_lpcr()
which doesn't hold the kvm->lock mutex around the call, as required.
This adds the lock/unlock pair, and for good measure, includes
the kvmppc_setup_partition_table() call in the locked region, since
it is altering global state of the VM.

This error appears not to have any fatal consequences for the host;
the consequences would be that the VCPUs could end up running with
different LPCR values, or an update to the LPCR value by userspace
using the one_reg interface could get overwritten, or the update
done by kvmhv_configure_mmu() could get overwritten.
