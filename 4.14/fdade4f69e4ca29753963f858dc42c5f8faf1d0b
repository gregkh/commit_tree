rxrpc: Make service connection lookup always check for retry

When an RxRPC service packet comes in, the target connection is looked up
by an rb-tree search under RCU and a read-locked seqlock; the seqlock retry
check is, however, currently skipped if we got a match, but probably
shouldn't be in case the connection we found gets replaced whilst we're
doing a search.

Make the lookup procedure always go through need_seqretry(), even if the
lookup was successful.  This makes sure we always pick up on a write-lock
event.

On the other hand, since we don't take a ref on the object, but rely on RCU
to prevent its destruction after dropping the seqlock, I'm not sure this is
necessary.
