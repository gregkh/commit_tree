mlxsw: spectrum_router: Add support for IPv6 routes addition / deletion

Allow directly connected and remote unicast IPv6 routes to be programmed
to the device's tables.

As with IPv4, identical routes - sharing the same destination prefix -
are ordered in a FIB node according to their table ID and then the
metric. While the kernel doesn't share the same trie for the local and
main table, this does happen in the device, so ordering according to
table ID is needed.

Since individual nexthops can be added and deleted in IPv6, each FIB
entry stores a linked list of the rt6_info structs it represents. Upon
the addition or deletion of a nexthop, a new nexthop group is allocated
according to the new configuration and the old one is destroyed.
Identical groups aren't currently consolidated, but will be in a
follow-up patchset.
