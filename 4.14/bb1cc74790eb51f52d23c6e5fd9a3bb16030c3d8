nvmet: implement valid sqhd values in completions

To support sqhd, for initiators that are following the spec and
paying attention to sqhd vs their sqtail values:

- add sqhd to struct nvmet_sq
- initialize sqhd to 0 in nvmet_sq_setup
- rather than propagate the 0's-based qsize value from the connect message
  which requires a +1 in every sqhd update, and as nothing else references
  it, convert to 1's-based value in nvmt_sq/cq_setup() calls.
- validate connect message sqsize being non-zero per spec.
- updated assign sqhd for every completion that goes back.

Also remove handling the NULL sq case in __nvmet_req_complete, as it can't
happen with the current code.
