MIPS: Fix CM region target definitions

The default CM target field in the GCR_BASE register is encoded with 0
meaning memory & 1 being reserved. However the definitions we use for
those bits effectively get these two values backwards - likely because
they were copied from the definitions for the CM regions where the
target is encoded differently. This results in use setting up GCR_BASE
with the reserved target value by default, rather than targeting memory
as intended. Although we currently seem to get away with this it's not a
great idea to rely upon.

Fix this by changing our macros to match the documentated target values.

The incorrect encoding became used as of commit 9f98f3dd0c51 ("MIPS: Add
generic CM probe & access code") in the Linux v3.15 cycle, and was
likely carried forwards from older but unused code introduced by
commit 39b8d5254246 ("[MIPS] Add support for MIPS CMP platform.") in the
v2.6.26 cycle.
