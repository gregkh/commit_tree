ALSA: control: obsolete user_ctl_lock

At a previous commit, concurrent requests for TLV data are maintained
exclusively between read requests and write/command requests. TLV
callback handlers in each driver has no risk from concurrent access for
reference/change.

In current implementation, 'struct snd_card' has a mutex to control
concurrent accesses to user-defined element sets. This commit obsoletes it.
