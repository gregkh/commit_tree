binder: fix memory corruption in binder_transaction binder

commit 7a4408c6bd3e ("binder: make sure accesses to proc/thread are
safe") made a change to enqueue tcomplete to thread->todo before
enqueuing the transaction. However, in err_dead_proc_or_thread case,
the tcomplete is directly freed, without dequeued. It may cause the
thread->todo list to be corrupted.

So, dequeue it before freeing.
