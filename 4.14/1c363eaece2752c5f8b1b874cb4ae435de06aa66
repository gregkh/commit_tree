android: binder: fix type mismatch warning

Allowing binder to expose the 64-bit API on 32-bit kernels caused a
build warning:

drivers/android/binder.c: In function 'binder_transaction_buffer_release':
drivers/android/binder.c:2220:15: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]
    fd_array = (u32 *)(parent_buffer + fda->parent_offset);
               ^
drivers/android/binder.c: In function 'binder_translate_fd_array':
drivers/android/binder.c:2445:13: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]
  fd_array = (u32 *)(parent_buffer + fda->parent_offset);
             ^
drivers/android/binder.c: In function 'binder_fixup_parent':
drivers/android/binder.c:2511:18: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]

This adds extra type casts to avoid the warning.

However, there is another problem with the Kconfig option: turning
it on or off creates two incompatible ABI versions, a kernel that
has this enabled cannot run user space that was built without it
or vice versa. A better solution might be to leave the option hidden
until the binder code is fixed to deal with both ABI versions.
