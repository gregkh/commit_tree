bpf: Add lru_hash_lookup performance test

Create a new case to test the LRU lookup performance.

At the beginning, the LRU map is fully loaded (i.e. the number of keys
is equal to map->max_entries).   The lookup is done through key 0
to num_map_entries and then repeats from 0 again.

This patch also creates an anonymous struct to properly
name the test params in stress_lru_hmap_alloc() in map_perf_test_kern.c.
