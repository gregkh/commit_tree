powerpc/mm: Ensure change_page_attr() doesn't invalidate pinned TLBs

__change_page_attr() uses flush_tlb_page().
flush_tlb_page() uses tlbie instruction, which also invalidates
pinned TLBs, which is not what we expect.

This patch modifies the implementation to use flush_tlb_kernel_range()
instead. This will make use of tlbia which will preserve pinned TLBs.
