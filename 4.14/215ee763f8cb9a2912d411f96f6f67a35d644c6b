powerpc: pseries: remove dlpar_attach_node dependency on full path

In preparation to stop storing the full node path in full_name, remove the
dependency on full_name from dlpar_attach_node(). Callers of
dlpar_attach_node() already have the parent device_node, so just pass the
parent node into dlpar_attach_node instead of the path. This avoids doing
a lookup of the parent node by the path.
