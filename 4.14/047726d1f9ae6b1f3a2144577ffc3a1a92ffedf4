tools include uapi x86: Grab a copy of unistd.h

In older distros we were not including our copies of unistd_{32,64}.h,
as we were relying on the system's asm/unistd.h, and a log time ago
the files to be included were asm-{x86_64,i386}/unistd.h.

Fix it by also carrying a copy of asm/unistd.h, that will be the same
as in modern distros and will allow us to provide missing __NR_setns,
for instance, in older distros.
