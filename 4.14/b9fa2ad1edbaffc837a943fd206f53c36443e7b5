autofs: use unsigned int/long instead of uint/ulong for ioctl args

The standard types unsigned int and unsigned long should be used for
.compat_ioctl.  autofs is the only fs using uing/ulong for this, and these
are even the only uint/ulong in the entire autofs code.

Drop unneeded long cast in return value of autofs_dev_ioctl_compat().
It's already long.
