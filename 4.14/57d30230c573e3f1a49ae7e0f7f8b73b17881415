drm/doc: vblank cleanup

Unify and review everything, plus make sure it's all correct markup.
Drop the kernel-doc for internal functions. Also rework the overview
section, it's become rather outdated.

Unfortuantely the kernel-doc in drm_driver isn't rendered yet, but
that will change as soon as drm_driver is kernel-docified properly.

Also document properly that drm_vblank_cleanup is optional, the core
calls this already.

v2: Make it clear that cleanup happens in drm_dev_fini for drivers
with their own ->release callback (Thierry).
