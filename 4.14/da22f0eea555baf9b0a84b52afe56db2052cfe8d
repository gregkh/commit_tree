bcache: silence static checker warning

In olden times, closure_return() used to have a hidden return built in.
We removed the hidden return but forgot to add a new return here.  If
"c" were NULL we would oops on the next line, but fortunately "c" is
never NULL.  Let's just remove the if statement.
