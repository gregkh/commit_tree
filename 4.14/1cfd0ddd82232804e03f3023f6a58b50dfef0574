bio_copy_user_iov(): don't ignore ->iov_offset

Since "block: support large requests in blk_rq_map_user_iov" we
started to call it with partially drained iter; that works fine
on the write side, but reads create a copy of iter for completion
time.  And that needs to take the possibility of ->iov_iter != 0
into account...
