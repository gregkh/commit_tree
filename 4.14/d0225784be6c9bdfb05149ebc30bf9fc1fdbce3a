rtnelink: Move link dump consistency check out of the loop

Calls to rtnl_dump_ifinfo() are protected by RTNL lock. So are the
{list,unlist}_netdevice() calls where we bump the net->dev_base_seq
number.

For this reason net->dev_base_seq can't change under out feet while
we're looping over links in rtnl_dump_ifinfo(). So move the check for
net->dev_base_seq change (since the last time we were called) out of the
loop.

This way we avoid giving a wrong impression that there are concurrent
updates to the link list going on while we're iterating over them.
