scsi: lpfc: Fix NVME PRLI handling during RSCN

A race condition was found whereby the initiator would receive the RSCN
for a new NVME device before it had a chance to register its FC4 support
with the fabric. Thus, when queried by the initiator, it would see that
the target supported FC-NVME.

Corrected by making the assumption that the target always supports
FC-NVME thus a PRLI is sent. It's ok for the target to reject it.
