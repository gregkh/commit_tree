IB/mlx4: Add support for RSS QP

Add support to work with a RSS QP by using an indirection table object
upon QP creation. Other related QP verbs (e.g. modify/destroy/query) were
updated as well for that QP mode.

Notes:
- The RX hash properties are supplied as driver private data.
- The RSS QP port is used on the associated WQs in its indirection
  table. Applying different ports during WQ life time is not allowed.
- The expected RSS QP flow is: create, modify(RST->INIT),
  modify(RST->RTR), destroy.
