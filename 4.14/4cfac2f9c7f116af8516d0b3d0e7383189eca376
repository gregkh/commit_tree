powerpc/mm: Simplify __set_fixmap()

__set_fixmap() uses __fix_to_virt() then does the boundary checks
by it self. Instead, we can use fix_to_virt() which does the
verification at build time. For this, we need to use it inline
so that GCC can see the real value of idx at buildtime.

In the meantime, we remove the 'fixmaps' variable.
This variable is set but has never been used from the beginning
(commit 2c419bdeca1d9 ("[POWERPC] Port fixmap from x86 and use
for kmap_atomic"))
