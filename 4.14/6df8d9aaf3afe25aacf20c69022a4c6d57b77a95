Drivers: hv: balloon: Correctly update onlined page count

Previously, num_pages_onlined was updated using value from memory online
notifier. This is incorrect because they assume that all hot-added pages
are online, even though we only online the amount that's backed by the
host. We should update num_pages_onlined only when the balloon driver
marks a page as online.
