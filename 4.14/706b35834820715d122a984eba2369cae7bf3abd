net/mlx5e: Rearrange netdevice ops structures

Since we are going to allow building the driver without eswitch support,
it would be possible to compile out the sriov netdevice ops struct such
that the basic ops instance will be used for non VF devices too.

Add missing udp tunnel ndos into mlx5e_netdev_ops_basic.

While here, rearrange some ndos in the sriov ops struct and put
vf/eswitch related ndos towards the end of it.
