drm/i915: Avoid null dereference if mst_port is unset.

I'm not sure if this is really the case and I don't believe
this is the real fix for the bug mentioned here, but since
I don't see a reliable path when mst_port is set and when
mode_valid is requested I believe it is worth to have this
protection here.
