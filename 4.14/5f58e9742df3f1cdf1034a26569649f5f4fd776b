drm/vmwgfx: Drop drm_vblank_cleanup

Again stopping the vblank before uninstalling the irq handler is kinda
the wrong way round, but the fb_off stuff should take care of
disabling the dsiplay at least in most cases. So drop the
drm_vblank_cleanup code since it's not really doing anything, it looks
all cargo-culted.

v2: Appease gcc better.

v3: Simplify code (Sean Paul)
