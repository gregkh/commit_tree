crypto: caam - fix LS1021A support on ARMv7 multiplatform kernel

When built using multi_v7_defconfig, driver does not work on LS1021A:
[...]
caam 1700000.crypto: can't identify CAAM ipg clk: -2
caam: probe of 1700000.crypto failed with error -2
[...]

It turns out we have to detect at runtime whether driver is running
on an i.MX platform or not.
