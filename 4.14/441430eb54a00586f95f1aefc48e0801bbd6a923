perf/aux: Only update ->aux_wakeup in non-overwrite mode

The following commit:

  d9a50b0256 ("perf/aux: Ensure aux_wakeup represents most recent wakeup index")

changed the AUX wakeup position calculation to rounddown(), which causes
a division-by-zero in AUX overwrite mode (aka "snapshot mode").

The zero denominator results from the fact that perf record doesn't set
aux_watermark to anything, in which case the kernel will set it to half
the AUX buffer size, but only for non-overwrite mode. In the overwrite
mode aux_watermark stays zero.

The good news is that, AUX overwrite mode, wakeups don't happen and
related bookkeeping is not relevant, so we can simply forego the whole
wakeup updates.
