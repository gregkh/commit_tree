net: add skb_frag_foreach_page and use with kmap_atomic

Skb frags may contain compound pages. Various operations map frags
temporarily using kmap_atomic, but this function works on single
pages, not whole compound pages. The distinction is only relevant
for high mem pages that require temporary mappings.

Introduce a looping mechanism that for compound highmem pages maps
one page at a time, does not change behavior on other pages.
Use the loop in the kmap_atomic callers in net/core/skbuff.c.

Verified by triggering skb_copy_bits with

    tcpdump -n -c 100 -i ${DEV} -w /dev/null &
    netperf -t TCP_STREAM -H ${HOST}

  and by triggering __skb_checksum with

    ethtool -K ${DEV} tx off

  repeated the tests with looping on a non-highmem platform
  (x86_64) by making skb_frag_must_loop always return true.
