media: staging: atomisp: gc0310: constify acpi_device_id

acpi_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with acpi_device_id provided by <acpi/acpi_bus.h> work with
const acpi_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  10361	   1824	      0	  12185	   2f99 drivers/staging/media/atomisp/i2c/gc0310.o
