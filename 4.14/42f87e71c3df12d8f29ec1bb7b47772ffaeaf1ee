iommu/iova: Add flush-queue data structures

This patch adds the basic data-structures to implement
flush-queues in the generic IOVA code. It also adds the
initialization and destroy routines for these data
structures.

The initialization routine is designed so that the use of
this feature is optional for the users of IOVA code.
