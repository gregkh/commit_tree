powerpc/mm/cxl: Add the fault handling cpu to mm cpumask

We use mm cpumask for serializing against lockless page table walk.
Anybody who is doing a lockless page table walk is expected to disable
irq and only cpus in mm cpumask is expected do the lockless walk. This
ensure that a THP split can send IPI to only cpus in the mm cpumask,
to make sure there are no parallel lockless page table walk.

Add the CAPI fault handling cpu to the mm cpumask so that we can do
the lockless page table walk while inserting hash page table entries.
