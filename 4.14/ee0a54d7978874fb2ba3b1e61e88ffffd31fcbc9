powerpc: Don't check MSR FP/VMX/VSX enable bits in analyse_instr()

This removes the checks for the FP/VMX/VSX enable bits in the MSR
from analyse_instr() and adds them to emulate_step() instead.

The reason for this is that we may want to use analyse_instr() in
a situation where the FP/VMX/VSX register values are stored in the
current thread_struct and the FP/VMX/VSX enable bits in the MSR
image in the pt_regs are zero.  Since analyse_instr() doesn't make
any changes to register state, it is reasonable for it to indicate
what the effect of an instruction would be even though the relevant
enable bit is off.
