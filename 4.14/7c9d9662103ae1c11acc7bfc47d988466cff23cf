IB/ipoib: Fix inconsistency with free_netdev and free_rdma_netdev

Call free_rdma_netdev instead of free_netdev each time we want to
release a netdevice. This call is also relevant for future freeing
of offloaded child interfaces.

This patch also adds a missing call for free netdevice when releasing
a parent interface that has child interfaces using ipoib_remove_one.
