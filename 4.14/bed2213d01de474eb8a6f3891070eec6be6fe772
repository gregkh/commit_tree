scsi: Use blk_mq_rq_to_pdu() to convert a request to a SCSI command pointer

Since commit e9c787e65c0c ("scsi: allocate scsi_cmnd structures as
part of struct request") struct request and struct scsi_cmnd are
adjacent. This means that there is now an alternative to reading
req->special to convert a pointer to a prepared request into a
SCSI command pointer, namely by using blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(). Make
this change where appropriate. Although this patch does not
change any functionality, it slightly improves performance and
slightly improves readability.
