gfs2: preserve i_mode if __gfs2_set_acl() fails

When changing a file's acl mask, __gfs2_set_acl() will first set the
group bits of i_mode to the value of the mask, and only then set the
actual extended attribute representing the new acl.

If the second part fails (due to lack of space, for example) and the
file had no acl attribute to begin with, the system will from now on
assume that the mask permission bits are actual group permission bits,
potentially granting access to the wrong users.

Prevent this by only changing the inode mode after the acl has been set.
