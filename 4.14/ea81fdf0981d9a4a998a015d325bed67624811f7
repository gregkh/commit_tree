Tools: hv: vss: Skip freezing filesystems backed by loop

Since a loop device is backed by a file, a backup will already result in
its parent filesystem being frozen. It's sufficient to just freeze the
parent filesystem, so we can skip the loop device.

This avoids a situation where a loop device and its parent filesystem are
both frozen and then thawed out of order. For example, if the loop device
is enumerated first, we would thaw it while its parent filesystem is still
frozen. The thaw operation fails and the loop device remains frozen.
