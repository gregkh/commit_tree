bcache: Correct return value for sysfs attach errors

If you encounter any errors in bch_cached_dev_attach it will return
a negative error code.  The variable 'v' which stores the result is
unsigned, thus user space sees a very large value returned for bytes
written which can cause incorrect user space behavior.  Utilize 1
signed variable to use throughout the function to preserve error return
capability.
