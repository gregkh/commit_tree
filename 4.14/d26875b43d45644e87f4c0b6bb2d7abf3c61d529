i40iw: Improve CQP timeout logic

The current timeout logic for Control Queue-Pair (CQP) OPs
does not take into account whether CQP makes progress but
rather blindly waits for a large timeout value, 100000 jiffies
for the completion event. Improve this by setting the timeout
based on whether the CQP is making progress or not. If the CQP
is hung, the timeout will happen sooner, in 5000 jiffies. Each
time the CQP progress is detetcted, the timeout extends by 5000
jiffies.
