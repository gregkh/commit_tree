f2fs: record quota during dot{,dot} recovery

In ->lookup(), we will have a try to recover dot or dotdot for
corrupted directory, once disk quota is on, if it allocates new
block during dotdot recovery, we need to record disk quota info
for the allocation, so this patch fixes this issue by adding
missing dquot_initialize() in __recover_dot_dentries.
