serial: imx: Avoid post-PIO cleanup if TX DMA is started

The imx_transmit_buffer function should return if TX DMA has already
been started and not just skip over the buffer PIO write loop. (Which
did fix the initial problem, but could have unintentional side-effects)

Tested on an i.MX6Q board with half-duplex RS-485 and with RS-232.
