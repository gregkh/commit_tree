thermal: core: Add some new helper functions to free resources

In order to easily free resources allocated by
'thermal_zone_create_device_groups()' we need 2 new helper functions.

The first one undoes 'thermal_zone_create_device_groups()'.
The 2nd one undoes 'create_trip_attrs()', which is a function called by
'thermal_zone_create_device_groups()'.
