media: svg: avoid too long lines

Sending patches with SVG files via e-mail has a drawback: line
size could be bigger than 998, with is the limit given by
RFC 5322[1]. So, we need to enforce a lower limit, in order to
allow those patches to be properly reviewed.

[1] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-2.1.1

So, use this small Perl script to limit columns size to ~900.

use Text::Wrap;
$Text::Wrap::columns = 900;

$t.=$_ while (<>);

print wrap("","",$t);
