media: cec: replace pin->cur_value by adap->cec_pin_is_high

The current CEC pin value (0 or 1) was part of the cec_pin struct,
but that assumes that CEC pin monitoring can only be used with
a driver that uses the low-level CEC pin framework.

But hardware that has both a high-level API and can monitor the
CEC pin at low-level at the same time does not need to depend on
the cec pin framework.

To support such devices remove the cur_value field from struct cec_pin
and add a cec_pin_is_high field to cec_adapter. This also makes it
possible to drop the '#ifdef CONFIG_CEC_PIN' in cec-api.c.
