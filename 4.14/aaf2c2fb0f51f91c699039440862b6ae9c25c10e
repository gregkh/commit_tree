ACPI / APEI: clear error status before acknowledging the error

Currently we acknowledge errors before clearing the error status.
This could cause a new error to be populated by firmware in-between
the error acknowledgment and the error status clearing which would
cause the second error's status to be cleared without being handled.
So, clear the error status before acknowledging the errors.

Also, make sure to acknowledge the error if the error status read
fails.
