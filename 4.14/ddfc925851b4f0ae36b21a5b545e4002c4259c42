drm/i915: Move stale context reaping to common i915_gem_context_create

We need to reap the stale contexts for all new contexts, be they created
by user in i915_gem_context_ioctl or from opening a new file in
i915_gem_context_open. Both paths may be called very frequently
accumulating many stale contexts before any worker has a chance to run
and free their memory.
