net: hns3: Add support of the HNAE3 framework

This patch adds the support of the HNAE3 (Hisilicon Network
Acceleration Engine 3) framework support to the HNS3 driver.

Framework facilitates clients like ENET(HNS3 Ethernet Driver), RoCE
and user-space Ethernet drivers (like ODP etc.) to register with HNAE3
devices and their associated operations.
