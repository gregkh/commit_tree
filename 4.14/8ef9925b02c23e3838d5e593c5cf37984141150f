sched/debug: Add explicit TASK_PARKED printing

Currently TASK_PARKED is masqueraded as TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, give it
its own print state because it will not in fact get woken by regular
wakeups and is a long-term state.

This requires moving TASK_PARKED into the TASK_REPORT mask, and since
that latter needs to be a contiguous bitmask, we need to shuffle the
bits around a bit.
