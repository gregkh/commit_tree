drm/i915/cnl: Add slice and subslice information to debugfs.

A missing part to EU slice power gating is the
debugfs interface. This patch actually should have been
squashed to the initial EU slice power gating one.

v2: Initial patch was merged without this part.

Fixes: c7ae7e9ab207 ("drm/i915/cnl: Configure EU slice power gating.")
