x86/fpu/math-emu: Add ENDPROC to functions

Functions in math-emu are annotated as ENTRY() symbols, but their
ends are not annotated at all. But these are standard functions
called from C, with proper stack register update etc.

Omitting the ends means:

  * the annotations are not paired and we cannot deal with such functions
    e.g. in objtool

  * the symbols are not marked as functions in the object file

  * there are no sizes of the functions in the object file

So fix this by adding ENDPROC() to each such case in math-emu.
