libnvdimm, btt: fix a missed NVDIMM_IO_ATOMIC case in the write path

The IO context conversion for rw_bytes missed a case in the BTT write
path (btt_map_write) which should've been marked as atomic.

In reality this should not cause a problem, because map writes are to
small for nsio_rw_bytes to attempt error clearing, but it should be
fixed for posterity.

Add a might_sleep() in the non-atomic section of nsio_rw_bytes so that
things like the nfit unit tests, which don't actually sleep, can catch
bugs like this.
