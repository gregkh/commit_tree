btrfs: Fix -EOVERFLOW handling in btrfs_ioctl_tree_search_v2

The buffer passed to btrfs_ioctl_tree_search* functions have to be at least
sizeof(struct btrfs_ioctl_search_header). If this is not the case then the
ioctl should return -EOVERFLOW and set the uarg->buf_size to the minimum
required size. Currently btrfs_ioctl_tree_search_v2 would return an -EOVERFLOW
error with ->buf_size being set to the value passed by user space. Fix this by
removing the size check and relying on search_ioctl, which already includes it
and correctly sets buf_size.
