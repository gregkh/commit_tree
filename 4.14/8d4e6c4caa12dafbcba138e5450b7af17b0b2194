perf/core, pt, bts: Get rid of itrace_started

I just noticed that hw.itrace_started and hw.config are aliased to the
same location. Now, the PT driver happens to use both, which works out
fine by sheer luck:

 - STORE(hw.itrace_start) is ordered before STORE(hw.config), in the
    program order, although there are no compiler barriers to ensure that,

 - to the perf_log_itrace_start() hw.itrace_start looks set at the same
   time as when it is intended to be set because both stores happen in the
   same path,

 - hw.config is never reset to zero in the PT driver.

Now, the use of hw.config by the PT driver makes more sense (it being a
HW PMU) than messing around with itrace_started, which is an awkward API
to begin with.

This patch replaces hw.itrace_started with an attach_state bit and an
API call for the PMU drivers to use to communicate the condition.
