HID: hid-elecom: extend to fix descriptor for HUGE trackball

In addition to DEFT, Elecom introduced a larger trackball called HUGE, in
both wired (M-HT1URBK) and wireless (M-HT1DRBK) versions. It has the same
buttons and behavior as the DEFT. This patch adds the two relevant USB IDs
to enable operation of the three Fn buttons on the top of the device.
