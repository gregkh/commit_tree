MIPS: bpf: Fix uninitialised target compiler error

Compiling ebpf_jit.c with gcc 4.9 results in a (likely spurious)
compiler warning, as gcc has detected that the variable "target" may be
used uninitialised. Since -Werror is active, this is treated as an error
and causes a kernel build failure whenever CONFIG_MIPS_EBPF_JIT is
enabled.

arch/mips/net/ebpf_jit.c: In function 'build_one_insn':
arch/mips/net/ebpf_jit.c:1118:80: error: 'target' may be used
uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    emit_instr(ctx, j, target);
                                                                                ^
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

Fix this by initialising "target" to 0. If it really is used
uninitialised this would result in a jump to 0 and a detectable run time
failure.
