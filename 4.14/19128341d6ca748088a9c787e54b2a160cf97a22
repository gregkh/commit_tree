selinux: remove AVC init audit log message

In the process of normalizing audit log messages, it was noticed that the AVC
initialization code registered an audit log KERNEL record that didn't fit the
standard format.  In the process of attempting to normalize it it was
determined that this record was not even necessary.  Remove it.
