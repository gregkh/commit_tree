staging: lustre: uapi: remove CONFIG_LUSTRE_OBD_MAX_IOCTL

Now that lustre_ioctl.h is a UAPI header the kernel configuration
option CONFIG_LUSTRE_OBD_MAX_IOCTL needs to be remove. The user
land utilites will no longer be able to see this option and
actually they never used this option before. Since this is the
case setting the kernel configuration to something other than
8K could actually break things. The best option is just hard
code it to 8K.
