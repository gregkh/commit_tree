s390/qeth: remove extra L3 adapterparms query

qeth_l3_setadapter_parms() queries the device for supported
adapterparms, even though they already have been queried as part of the
device's high-level setup. Remove that extra call.

The only call chain for qeth_l3_setadapter_parms() is
__qeth_l3_set_online()
	qeth_core_hardsetup_card()
		qeth_query_setadapterparms()
	qeth_l3_setadapter_parms()
		qeth_query_setadapterparms()

, and we only reach qeth_l3_setadapter_parms() if the first
adapterparms query succeeds. Hence removing the second query results in
no loss of functionality.
