xhci: rework bus_resume and check ports are suspended before resuming them.

bus_resume() tried to resume the same ports the bus_suspend()
suspeded. This caused PLC timeouts in case a suspended device disconnected
and was not in a resumable state at bus_resume().

Add a check to make sure the link state is either U3 or resuming
before actually resuming the link.

At the same time do some other changes such as make sure we remove
wake on connect/disconnect/overcurrent also for the resuming ports,
and avoid extra portsc port register writes.

This improves resume time with 10ms in those PLC timeout cases where
devices disconnect at suspend/resume cycle.
