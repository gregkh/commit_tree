net: fib_rules: Implement notification logic in core

Unlike the routing tables, the FIB rules share a common core, so instead
of replicating the same logic for each address family we can simply dump
the rules and send notifications from the core itself.

To protect the integrity of the dump, a rules-specific sequence counter
is added for each address family and incremented whenever a rule is
added or deleted (under RTNL).
