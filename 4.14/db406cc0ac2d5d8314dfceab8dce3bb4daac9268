vfio/type1: Cope with hardware MSI reserved regions

For ARM-based systems with a GICv3 ITS to provide interrupt isolation,
but hardware limitations which are worked around by having MSIs bypass
SMMU translation (e.g. HiSilicon Hip06/Hip07), VFIO neglects to check
for the IRQ_DOMAIN_FLAG_MSI_REMAP capability, (and thus erroneously
demands unsafe_interrupts) if a software-managed MSI region is absent.

Fix this by always checking for isolation capability at both the IRQ
domain and IOMMU domain levels, rather than predicating that on whether
MSIs require an IOMMU mapping (which was always slightly tenuous logic).
