arm64: hugetlb: set_huge_pte_at Add WARN_ON on !pte_present

This patch adds a WARN_ON to set_huge_pte_at as the accessor assumes
that entries to be written down are all present. (There are separate
accessors to clear huge ptes).

We will need to handle the !pte_present case where memory offlining
is used on hugetlb pages. swap and migration entries will be supplied
to set_huge_pte_at in this case.
