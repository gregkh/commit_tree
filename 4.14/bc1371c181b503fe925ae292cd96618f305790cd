scsi: pm8001: fix double free in pm8001_pci_probe

In function pm8001_pci_probe(), on errors that the control flow jumps to
label err_out_ha_free, function pm8001_free() is called. In pm8001_free(),
scsi_host_put() is called to release shost, which keeps the return value
of scsi_host_alloc(). After pm8001_free() returns, kfree() is called to
free shost again, resulting in a double free bug. This patch removes
scsi_host_put() from pm8001_free() and explicitly calls scsi_host_put()
to release Scsi_Host in need.
