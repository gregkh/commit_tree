mtd: nand: qcom: support for read location registers

In EBI2, all codeword data will be read in FLASH_BUF_ACC buffer
and ADM will copy the data from source (FLASH_BUF_ACC) to
destination (memory for data read).

In QPIC, there is no FLASH_BUF_ACC and all the codeword data will
held in QPIC BAM FIFO buffers. It provides multiple READ_LOCATION
registers which will be used for copying the data from FIFO to
memory. The READ_LOCATION register will be used to read a
specific amount of data from a specific offset within the flash
buffer. It supports sequential offset requests. Each request is
composed of the following fields:

a. Offset within the flash buffer from which data should be
   read
b. Amount of data to be read
c. Flag bit specifying the last read request from the flash
   buffer. Following the last read request the NANDc refers to the
   buffer as empty.
