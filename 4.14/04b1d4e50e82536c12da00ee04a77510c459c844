net: core: Make the FIB notification chain generic

The FIB notification chain is currently soley used by IPv4 code.
However, we're going to introduce IPv6 FIB offload support, which
requires these notification as well.

As explained in commit c3852ef7f2f8 ("ipv4: fib: Replay events when
registering FIB notifier"), upon registration to the chain, the callee
receives a full dump of the FIB tables and rules by traversing all the
net namespaces. The integrity of the dump is ensured by a per-namespace
sequence counter that is incremented whenever a change to the tables or
rules occurs.

In order to allow more address families to use the chain, each family is
expected to register its fib_notifier_ops in its pernet init. These
operations allow the common code to read the family's sequence counter
as well as dump its tables and rules in the given net namespace.

Additionally, a 'family' parameter is added to sent notifications, so
that listeners could distinguish between the different families.

Implement the common code that allows listeners to register to the chain
and for address families to register their fib_notifier_ops. Subsequent
patches will implement these operations in IPv6.

In the future, ipmr and ip6mr will be extended to provide these
notifications as well.
