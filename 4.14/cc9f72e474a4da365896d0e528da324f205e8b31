signal/sparc: Document a conflict with SI_USER with SIGFPE

Setting si_code to __SI_FAULT results in a userspace seeing
an si_code of 0.  This is the same si_code as SI_USER.  Posix
and common sense requires that SI_USER not be a signal specific
si_code.  As such this use of 0 for the si_code is a pretty
horribly broken ABI.

This was introduced in 2.3.41 so this mess has had a long time for
people to be able to start depending on it.

As this bug has existed for 17 years already I don't know if it is
worth fixing.  It is definitely worth documenting what is going
on so that no one decides to copy this bad decision.
