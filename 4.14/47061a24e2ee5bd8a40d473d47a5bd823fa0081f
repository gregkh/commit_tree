x86/mm: Factor out CR3-building code

Current, the code that assembles a value to load into CR3 is
open-coded everywhere.  Factor it out into helpers build_cr3() and
build_cr3_noflush().

This makes one semantic change: __get_current_cr3_fast() was wrong
on SME systems.  No one noticed because the only caller is in the
VMX code, and there are no CPUs with both SME and VMX.
