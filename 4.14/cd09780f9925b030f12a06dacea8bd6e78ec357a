mmc: renesas-sdhi: provide a whitelist for Gen3 SoC ES versions

Provide a whitelist for Gen3 SoC ES versions for both the SYS DMAC and
internal DMAC variants of the SDHI driver.  This is to allow drivers to
only initialise for Gen3 SoC ES versions for which they are the appropriate
DMAC implementation.  Currently internal DMAC is the appropriate
implementation for all supported Gen3 SoC ES versions.
