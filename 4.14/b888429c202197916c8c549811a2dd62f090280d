IB/hfi1: Remove atomic SDMA_REQ_SEND_DONE bit operation

The atomic SDMA_REQ_SEND_DONE bit is set by the
process-level code, and then the same process-level
code uses the bit to test that all packets have been
submitted incurring a costly atomic read.

Use a bool type with a READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE
pairing for this bit, and use the same condition that
is used to set the bit to test that all packets have
been submitted.
