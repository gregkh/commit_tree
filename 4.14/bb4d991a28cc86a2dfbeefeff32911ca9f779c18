tcp: adjust tail loss probe timeout

This patch adjusts the timeout formula to schedule the TCP loss probe
(TLP). The previous formula uses 2*SRTT or 1.5*RTT + DelayACKMax if
only one packet is in flight. It keeps a lower bound of 10 msec which
is too large for short RTT connections (e.g. within a data-center).
The new formula = 2*RTT + (inflight == 1 ? 200ms : 2ticks) which
performs better for short and fast connections.
