iio: adc: ti-ads1015: fix incorrect data rate setting update

The ti-ads1015 driver has eight iio voltage channels and each iio channel
can hold own sampling frequency information.

The ADS1015 device only have a single config register which contains an
input multiplexer selection, PGA and data rate settings.  So the driver
should load the correct settings when the input multiplexer selection is
changed.

However, regardless of which channlel is currently selected, changing any
iio channel's sampling frequency information immediately overwrites the
current data rate setting in the config register.

It breaks the current data rate setting if the different channel's sampling
frequency information is changed because the data rate setting is not
reloaded when the input multiplexer is switched.

This removes the unexpected config register update and correctly load the
data rate setting before getting adc result.
