irqchip: Do not blindly select CONFIG_GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER

Implementing CONFIG_GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER is a decision that is
made at the architecture level, and shouldn't involve the irqchip
at all (we even provide a fallback helper when the option isn't
selected).

Drop all instances of such selection from non-arch code.
