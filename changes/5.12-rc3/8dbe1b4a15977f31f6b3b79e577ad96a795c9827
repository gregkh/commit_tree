drm: Move legacy device list out of drm_driver

The drm_driver structure contains a single field (legacy_dev_list) that
is modified by the DRM core, used to store a linked list of legacy DRM
devices associated with the driver. In order to make the structure
const, move the field out to a global variable. This requires locking
access to the global where the local field didn't require serialization,
but this only affects legacy drivers, and isn't in any hot path.

While at it, compile-out the legacy_dev_list field when DRM_LEGACY isn't
defined.
