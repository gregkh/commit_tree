tools/nolibc: Remove incorrect definitions of __ARCH_WANT_*

The __ARCH_WANT_* definitions were added in order to support aarch64
when it was missing some syscall definitions (including __NR_dup2,
__NR_fork, and __NR_getpgrp), but these __ARCH_WANT_* definitions were
actually wrong because these syscalls do not exist on this platform.
Defining these resulted in exposing invalid definitions, resulting in
failures on aarch64.

The missing syscalls were since implemented based on the newer ones
(__NR_dup3,  __NR_clone, __NR_getpgid) so these incorrect __ARCH_WANT_*
definitions are no longer needed.

Thanks to Mark Rutland for spotting this incorrect analysis and
explaining why it was wrong.

This is a port of nolibc's upstream commit 00b1b0d9b2a4 to the Linux
kernel.
