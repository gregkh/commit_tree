kernel: provide create_io_thread() helper

Provide a generic helper for setting up an io_uring worker. Returns a
task_struct so that the caller can do whatever setup is needed, then call
wake_up_new_task() to kick it into gear.

Add a kernel_clone_args member, io_thread, which tells copy_process() to
mark the task with PF_IO_WORKER.
