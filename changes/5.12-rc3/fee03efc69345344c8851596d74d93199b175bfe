ALSA: usb-audio: add mixer quirks for Pioneer DJM-900NXS2

This commit adds mixer quirks for the Pioneer DJM-900NXS2 mixer. This
device has 6 capture channels, 5 of them allow setting the signal
source. This adds controls for these, similar to the DJM-250Mk2.
However, playpack channels are not controllable via software like on the
250Mk2, as they can only be set manually on the mixing console.
Read-only controls showing the currently selected playback channels are
omitted.
