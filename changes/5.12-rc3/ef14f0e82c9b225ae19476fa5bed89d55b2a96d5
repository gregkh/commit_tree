platform/x86: acer-wmi: Don't use ACPI_EXCEPTION()

ACPI_EXCEPTION is only intended for internal use by the ACPICA code.

ACPI_EXCEPTION was being used here to change the apci_status code into
something human-readable, use acpi_format_exception() for this instead,
which is the proper way to do this outside of ACPICA.
