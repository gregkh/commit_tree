arm64: do not descend to vdso directories twice

arm64 descends into each vdso directory twice; first in vdso_prepare,
second during the ordinary build process.

PPC mimicked it and uncovered a problem [1]. In the first descend,
Kbuild directly visits the vdso directories, therefore it does not
inherit subdir-ccflags-y from upper directories.

This means the command line parameters may differ between the two.
If it happens, the offset values in the generated headers might be
different from real offsets of vdso.so in the kernel.

This potential danger should be avoided. The vdso directories are
built in the vdso_prepare stage, so the second descend is unneeded.
