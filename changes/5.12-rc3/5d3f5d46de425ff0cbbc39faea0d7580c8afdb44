dt-bindings: sram: Add compatible strings for the Meson AO ARC SRAM

Amlogic Meson8, Meson8b and Meson8m2 SoCs embed an ARC EM4 core
typically used for managing system suspend. A section of the SoCs SRAM
is mapped as memory for this ARC core. Add new compatible strings for
the SRAM section for the ARC core memory.
