ALSA: ctxfi: cthw20k2: fix mask on conf to allow 4 bits

Currently the mask operation on variable conf is just 3 bits so
the switch statement case value of 8 is unreachable dead code.
The function daio_mgr_dao_init can be passed a 4 bit value,
function dao_rsc_init calls it with conf set to:

     conf = (desc->msr & 0x7) | (desc->passthru << 3);

so clearly when desc->passthru is set to 1 then conf can be
at least 8.

Fix this by changing the mask to 0xf.
