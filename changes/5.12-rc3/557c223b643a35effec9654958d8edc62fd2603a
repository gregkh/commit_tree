selftests/bpf: No need to drop the packet when there is no geneve opt

In bpf geneve tunnel test we set geneve option on tx side. On rx side we
only call bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt(). Since commit 9c2e14b48119 ("ip_tunnels:
Set tunnel option flag when tunnel metadata is present") geneve_rx() will
not add TUNNEL_GENEVE_OPT flag if there is no geneve option, which cause
bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt() return ENOENT and _geneve_get_tunnel() in
test_tunnel_kern.c drop the packet.

As it should be valid that bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt() return error when
there is not tunnel option, there is no need to drop the packet and
break all geneve rx traffic. Just set opt_class to 0 in this test and
keep returning TC_ACT_OK.
