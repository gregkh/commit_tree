ASoC: mediatek: mt8192-mt6359: support audio over DP

If the DTS property is specified, the DP bridge should populate a
"hdmi-codec" platform device (sound/soc/codecs/hdmi-codec.c).

The "hdmi-codec" device is the communication relayer between the ASoC
machine driver and the DP bridge.  For example:
- Notifies DP bridge when setting hw_param.
- Notifies ASoC when jack detection events.
