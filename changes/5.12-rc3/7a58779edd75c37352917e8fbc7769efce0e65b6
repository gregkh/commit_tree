IB/mlx5: Improve query port for representor port

Improve query port functionality for representor port as below.

1. RoCE Qkey violation counters are not applicable for representor port.
2. Avoid setting gid_tbl_len twice for representor port.
3. Avoid setting ip_gids and IB_PORT_CM_SUP property for representor port
   as GID table is empty and CM support is not present in representor
   mode.
