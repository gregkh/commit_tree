media: ccs-pll: Switch from standard integer types to kernel ones

The preferred integer types in the kernel are the Linux specific ones,
switch from standard C types to u32 and alike.

The patch has been produced with the following Coccinelle spatch, with few
alignment adjustments:

@@
typedef uint32_t;
typedef u32;
@@
- uint32_t
+ u32
