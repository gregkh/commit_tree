ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for Intel NUC 10

This adds a new SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) and applies it to the Intel NUC 10
devices. This fixes the issue of the devices not having audio input and
output on the headset jack because the kernel does not recognize when
something is plugged in.

The new quirk was inspired by the quirk for the Intel NUC 8 devices, but
it turned out that the NUC 10 uses another pin. This information was
acquired by black box testing likely pins.
