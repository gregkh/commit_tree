IMA: generalize keyring specific measurement constructs

IMA functions such as ima_match_keyring(), process_buffer_measurement(),
ima_match_policy() etc.  handle data specific to keyrings.  Currently,
these constructs are not generic to handle any func specific data.
This makes it harder to extend them without code duplication.

Refactor the keyring specific measurement constructs to be generic and
reusable in other measurement scenarios.
