coresight: etm4x: Add sysreg access helpers

ETM architecture defines the system instructions for accessing
via register accesses. Add basic support for accessing a given
register via system instructions.

We split the list of registers as :
 1) Accessible only from memory mapped interface
 2) Accessible from system register instructions.

All registers are accessible via the memory-mapped interface.
However, some registers are not accessible via the system
instructions. This list is then used to further filter out
the files we expose via sysfs.
