usb/c67x00: Replace tasklet with work

Tasklets have long been deprecated as being too heavy on the system
by running in irq context - and this is not a performance critical
path. If a higher priority process wants to run, it must wait for
the tasklet to finish before doing so.

c67x00_do_work() will now run in process context and have further
concurrency (tasklets being serialized among themselves), but this
is done holding the c67x00->lock, so it should be fine. Furthermore,
this patch fixes the usage of the lock in the callback as otherwise
it would need to be irq-safe.
