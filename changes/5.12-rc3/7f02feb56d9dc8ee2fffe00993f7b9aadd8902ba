arm64: dts: rockchip: add SPDIF node for rk3399-rockpro64

This patch adds 'disabled' SPDIF sound node and related settings
for rk3399-rockpro64.

There are 2 reasons:
  - All RK3399 dma-bus channels have been already used by I2S0/1/2
  - RockPro64 does not have SPDIF optical nor coaxial connector,
    just have 3pins
