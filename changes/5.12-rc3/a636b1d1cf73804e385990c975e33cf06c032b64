xfs: trigger all block gc scans when low on quota space

The functions to run an eof/cowblocks scan to try to reduce quota usage
are kind of a mess -- the logic repeatedly initializes an eofb structure
and there are logic bugs in the code that result in the cowblocks scan
never actually happening.

Replace all three functions with a single function that fills out an
eofb and runs both eof and cowblocks scans.
