iio: Handle enumerated properties with gaps

Some enums might have gaps or reserved values in the middle of their value
range. E.g. consider a 2-bit enum where the values 0, 1 and 3 have a
meaning, but 2 is a reserved value and can not be used.

Add support for such enums to the IIO enum helper functions. A reserved
values is marked by setting its entry in the items array to NULL rather
than the normal descriptive string value.
