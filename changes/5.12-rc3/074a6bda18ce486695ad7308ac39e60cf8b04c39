ARM: 9048/1: sa1111: make sa1111 bus's remove callback return void

The driver core ignores the return value of struct device_driver::remove
because there is only little that can be done. To simplify the quest to
make this function return void, let struct sa1111_driver::remove return
void, too. All users already unconditionally return 0, this commit makes
it obvious that returning an error code is a bad idea and ensures future
users behave accordingly.
