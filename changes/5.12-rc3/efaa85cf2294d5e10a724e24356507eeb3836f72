iwlwifi: mvm: set enabled in the PPAG command properly

When version 2 of the PER_PLATFORM_ANT_GAIN_CMD was implemented, we
started copying the values from the command that we have stored into a
local instance.  But we accidentally forgot to copy the enabled flag,
so in practice PPAG is never really enabled.  Fix this by copying the
flag from our stored data a we should.
