xen/events: avoid handling the same event on two cpus at the same time

When changing the cpu affinity of an event it can happen today that
(with some unlucky timing) the same event will be handled on the old
and the new cpu at the same time.

Avoid that by adding an "event active" flag to the per-event data and
call the handler only if this flag isn't set.
