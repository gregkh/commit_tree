drm/ttm: cleanup BO size handling v3

Based on an idea from Dave, but cleaned up a bit.

We had multiple fields for essentially the same thing.

Now bo->base.size is the original size of the BO in
arbitrary units, usually bytes.

bo->mem.num_pages is the size in number of pages in the
resource domain of bo->mem.mem_type.

v2: use the GEM object size instead of the BO size
v3: fix printks in some places
