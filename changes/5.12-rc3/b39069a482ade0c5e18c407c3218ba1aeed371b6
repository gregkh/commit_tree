dt-bindings: phy: brcm, brcmstb-usb-phy: convert to the json-schema

Changes that require mentioning:
1. interrupt-names
   Name "wakeup" was changed to the "wake". It matches example and what
   Linux driver looks for in the first place
2. brcm,ipp and brcm,ioc
   Both were described as booleans with 0 / 1 values. In examples they
   were integers and Linux checks for int as well. Both got uint32.
3. Added minimal description
