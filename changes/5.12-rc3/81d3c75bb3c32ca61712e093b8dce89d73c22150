iommu/vt-d: Add new enum value and structure for SATC

Starting from Intel Platform VT-d v3.2, BIOS may provide new remapping
structure SATC for SOC integrated devices, according to section 8.8 of
Intel VT-d architecture specification v3.2. The SATC structure reports
a list of the devices that require ATS for normal device operation. It
is a functional requirement that these devices will not work without OS
enabling ATS capability.

This patch introduces the new enum value and structure to represent the
remapping information. Kernel should parse the information from the
reporting structure and enable ATC for the devices as needed.
