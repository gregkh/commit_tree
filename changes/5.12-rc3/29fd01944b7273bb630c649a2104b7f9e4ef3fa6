static_call: Provide DEFINE_STATIC_CALL_RET0()

DECLARE_STATIC_CALL() must pass the original function targeted for a
given static call. But DEFINE_STATIC_CALL() may want to initialize it as
off. In this case we can't pass NULL (for functions without return value)
or __static_call_return0 (for functions returning a value) directly
to DEFINE_STATIC_CALL() as that may trigger a static call redeclaration
with a different function prototype. Type casts neither can work around
that as they don't get along with typeof().

The proper way to do that for functions that don't return a value is
to use DEFINE_STATIC_CALL_NULL(). But functions returning a actual value
don't have an equivalent yet.

Provide DEFINE_STATIC_CALL_RET0() to solve this situation.
