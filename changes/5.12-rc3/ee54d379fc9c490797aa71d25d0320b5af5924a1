MIPS: Make check condition for SDBBP consistent with EJTAG spec

According to MIPS EJTAG Specification [1], a Debug Breakpoint
exception occurs when an SDBBP instruction is executed, the
CP0_DEBUG bit DBp indicates that a Debug Breakpoint exception
occurred.

When I read the original code, it looks a little confusing
at first glance, just check bit DBp for SDBBP to make the
code more readable, it will be much easier to understand.
