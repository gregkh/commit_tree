can: dev: extend struct can_skb_priv to hold CAN frame length

In order to implement byte queue limits (bql) in CAN drivers, the length of the
CAN frame needs to be passed into the networking stack after queueing and after
transmission completion.

To avoid to calculate this length twice, extend the struct can_skb_priv to hold
the length of the CAN frame and extend __can_get_echo_skb() to return that
value.
