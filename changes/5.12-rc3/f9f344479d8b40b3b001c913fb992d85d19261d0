tracing: Fix comment about the trace_event_call flags

In the declaration of the struct trace_event_call, the flags has the bits
defined in the comment above it. But these bits are also defined by the
TRACE_EVENT_FL_* enums just above the declaration of the struct. As the
comment about the flags in the struct has become stale and incorrect, just
replace it with a reference to the TRACE_EVENT_FL_* enum above.
