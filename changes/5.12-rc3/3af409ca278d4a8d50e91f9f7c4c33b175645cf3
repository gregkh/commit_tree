net: enetc: fix destroyed phylink dereference during unbind

The following call path suggests that calling unregister_netdev on an
interface that is up will first bring it down.

enetc_pf_remove
-> unregister_netdev
   -> unregister_netdevice_queue
      -> unregister_netdevice_many
         -> dev_close_many
            -> __dev_close_many
               -> enetc_close
                  -> enetc_stop
                     -> phylink_stop

However, enetc first destroys the phylink instance, then calls
unregister_netdev. This is already dissimilar to the setup (and error
path teardown path) from enetc_pf_probe, but more than that, it is buggy
because it is invalid to call phylink_stop after phylink_destroy.

So let's first unregister the netdev (and let the .ndo_stop events
consume themselves), then destroy the phylink instance, then free the
netdev.
