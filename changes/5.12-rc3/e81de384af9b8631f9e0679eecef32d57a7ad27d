vt: keyboard, defkeymap.c_shipped, approach the unicode table

Commit 5ce2087ed0eb (Fix default compose table initialization) fixed
unicode table so that the values are not sign extended. The upstream
(kbd package) chose a different approach. They use hexadecimal values.
So use the same, so that the output of loadkeys and our shipped file
correspond more to each other.
