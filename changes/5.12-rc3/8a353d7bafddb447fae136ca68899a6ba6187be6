ASoC: soc-pcm: fix hw param limits calculation for multi-DAI

In case DPCM runtime has multiple CPU DAIs, dpcm_init_runtime_hw() is
called multiple times, once for each CPU DAI. This will lead to
ignoring hw limits of all but the last DAI.

Fix this by moving soc_pcm_hw_init() up by one level to
dpcm_init_runtime_hw().
