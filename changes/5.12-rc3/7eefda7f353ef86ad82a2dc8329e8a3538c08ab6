s390/qeth: fix notification for pending buffers during teardown

The cited commit reworked the state machine for pending TX buffers.
In qeth_iqd_tx_complete() it turned PENDING into a transient state, and
uses NEED_QAOB for buffers that get parked while waiting for their QAOB
completion.

But it missed to adjust the check in qeth_tx_complete_buf(). So if
qeth_tx_complete_pending_bufs() is called during teardown to drain
the parked TX buffers, we no longer raise a notification for af_iucv.

Instead of updating the checked state, just move this code into
qeth_tx_complete_pending_bufs() itself. This also gets rid of the
special-case in the common TX completion path.
