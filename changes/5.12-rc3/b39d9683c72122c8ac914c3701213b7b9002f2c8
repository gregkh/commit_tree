ARM: dts: rockchip: add QoS register compatibles for rk3066/rk3188

was set to 2. Current Rockchip dtsi files only use "syscon" for
QoS registers. Add Rockchip QoS compatibles for rk3066/rk3188
to reduce notifications produced with:

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/syscon.yaml
