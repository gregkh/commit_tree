i40e: Fix addition of RX filters after enabling FW LLDP agent

Fix addition of VLAN filter for PF after enabling FW LLDP agent.
Changing LLDP Agent causes FW to re-initialize per NVM settings.
Remove default PF filter and move "Enable/Disable" to currently used
reset flag.
Without this patch PF would try to add MAC VLAN filter with default
switch filter present. This causes AQ error and sets promiscuous mode
on.
