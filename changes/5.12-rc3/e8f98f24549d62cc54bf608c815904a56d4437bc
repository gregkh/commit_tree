io_uring: always wait for sqd exited when stopping SQPOLL thread

We have a tiny race where io_put_sq_data() calls io_sq_thead_stop()
and finds the thread gone, but the thread has indeed not fully
exited or called complete() yet. Close it up by always having
io_sq_thread_stop() wait on completion of the exit event.
