net: avoid infinite loop in mpls_gso_segment when mpls_hlen == 0

A packet with skb_inner_network_header(skb) == skb_network_header(skb)
and ETH_P_MPLS_UC will prevent mpls_gso_segment from pulling any headers
from the packet. Subsequently, the call to skb_mac_gso_segment will
again call mpls_gso_segment with the same packet leading to an infinite
loop. In addition, ensure that the header length is a multiple of four,
which should hold irrespective of the number of stacked labels.
