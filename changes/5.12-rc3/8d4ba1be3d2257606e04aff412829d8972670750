ASoC: SOF: pci: split PCI into different drivers

Move PCI IDs and device-specific definitions out of common code. No
functionality change for now, just code split and removal of
IF_ENABLED() which made the configurations too complicated in case of
reuse of IP across generations.

Additional changes to address the DSP_CONFIG case and SoundWire
depends/select confusions are provided in follow-up patches.
