tools headers UAPI: Sync KVM's kvm.h and vmx.h headers with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  fe6b6bc802b40081 ("KVM: VMX: Enable bus lock VM exit")

That makes 'perf kvm-stat' aware of this new BUS_LOCK exit reason, thus
addressing the following perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h
