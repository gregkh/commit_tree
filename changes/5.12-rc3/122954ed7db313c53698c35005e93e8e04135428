KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Rename current DAWR macros and variables

Power10 is introducing a second DAWR (Data Address Watchpoint
Register). Use real register names (with suffix 0) from ISA for
current macros and variables used by kvm.  One exception is
KVM_REG_PPC_DAWR.  Keep it as it is because it's uapi so changing it
will break userspace.
