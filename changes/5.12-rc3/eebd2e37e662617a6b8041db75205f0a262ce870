io_uring: don't take task ring-file notes

With ->flush() gone we're now leaving all uring file notes until the
task dies/execs, so the ctx will not be freed until all tasks that have
ever submit a request die. It was nicer with flush but not much, we
could have locked as described ctx in many cases.

Now we guarantee that ctx outlives all tctx in a sense that
io_ring_exit_work() waits for all tctxs to drop their corresponding
enties in ->xa, and ctx won't go away until then. Hence, additional
io_uring file reference (a.k.a. task file notes) are not needed anymore.
