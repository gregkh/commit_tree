virt: acrn: Introduce interrupt injection interfaces

ACRN userspace need to inject virtual interrupts into a User VM in
devices emulation.

HSM needs provide interfaces to do so.

Introduce following interrupt injection interfaces:

ioctl ACRN_IOCTL_SET_IRQLINE:
  Pass data from userspace to the hypervisor, and inform the hypervisor
  to inject a virtual IOAPIC GSI interrupt to a User VM.

ioctl ACRN_IOCTL_INJECT_MSI:
  Pass data struct acrn_msi_entry from userspace to the hypervisor, and
  inform the hypervisor to inject a virtual MSI to a User VM.

ioctl ACRN_IOCTL_VM_INTR_MONITOR:
  Set a 4-Kbyte aligned shared page for statistics information of
  interrupts of a User VM.
