ice: Remove xsk_buff_pool from VSI structure

Current implementation of netdev already contains xsk_buff_pools.
We no longer have to contain these structures in ice_vsi.

Refactor the code to operate on netdev-provided xsk_buff_pools.

Move scheduling napi on each queue to a separate function to
simplify setup function.
