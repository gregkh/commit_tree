usb: dwc3: qcom: Add missing DWC3 OF node refcount decrement

of_get_child_by_name() increments the reference counter of the OF node it
managed to find. So after the code is done using the device node, the
refcount must be decremented. Add missing of_node_put() invocation then
to the dwc3_qcom_of_register_core() method, since DWC3 OF node is being
used only there.
