ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for Clevo NH55RZQ

This applies a SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) to the Clevo NH55RZQ barebone. This
fixes the issue of the device not recognizing a pluged in microphone.

The device has both, a microphone only jack, and a speaker + microphone
combo jack. The combo jack already works. The microphone-only jack does
not recognize when a device is pluged in without this patch.
