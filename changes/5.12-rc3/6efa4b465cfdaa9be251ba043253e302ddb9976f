gpu/drm: ring_mirror_list --> pending_list

Rename "ring_mirror_list" to "pending_list",
to describe what something is, not what it does,
how it's used, or how the hardware implements it.

This also abstracts the actual hardware
implementation, i.e. how the low-level driver
communicates with the device it drives, ring, CAM,
etc., shouldn't be exposed to DRM.

The pending_list keeps jobs submitted, which are
out of our control. Usually this means they are
pending execution status in hardware, but the
latter definition is a more general (inclusive)
definition.
