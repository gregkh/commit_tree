RDMA/rxe: Fix race in rxe_mcast.c

Fix a race in rxe_mcast.c that occurs when two QPs try at the same time to
attach a multicast address. Both QPs lookup the mgid address in a pool of
multicast groups and if they do not find it create a new group elem.

Fix this by locking the lookup/alloc/add key sequence and using the
unlocked APIs added in this patch set.
