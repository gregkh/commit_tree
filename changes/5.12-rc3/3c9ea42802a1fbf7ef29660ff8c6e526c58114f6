clk: Mark fwnodes when their clock provider is added/removed

This allows fw_devlink to recognize clock provider drivers that don't
use the device-driver model to initialize the device. fw_devlink will
use this information to make sure consumers of such clock providers
aren't indefinitely blocked from probing, waiting for the power domain
device to appear and bind to a driver.
