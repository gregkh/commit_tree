media: device property: Define format macros for ports and endpoints

OF, ACPI and software_nodes all implement graphs including nodes for ports
and endpoints. These are all intended to be named with a common schema,
as "port@n" and "endpoint@n" where n is an unsigned int representing the
index of the node. To ensure commonality across the subsystems, provide a
set of macros to define the format.
