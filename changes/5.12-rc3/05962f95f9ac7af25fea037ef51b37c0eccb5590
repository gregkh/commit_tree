io_uring: SQPOLL parking fixes

We keep running into weird dependency issues between the sqd lock and
the parking state. Disentangle the SQPOLL thread from the last bits of
the kthread parking inheritance, and just replace the parking state,
and two associated locks, with a single rw mutex. The SQPOLL thread
keeps the mutex for read all the time, except if someone has marked us
needing to park. Then we drop/re-acquire and try again.

This greatly simplifies the parking state machine (by just getting rid
of it), and makes it a lot more obvious how it works - if you need to
modify the ctx list, then you simply park the thread which will grab
the lock for writing.

Fold in fix from Hillf Danton on not setting STOP on a fatal signal.
