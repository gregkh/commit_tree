io_uring: clear IOCB_WAITQ for non -EIOCBQUEUED return

The callback can only be armed, if we get -EIOCBQUEUED returned. It's
important that we clear the WAITQ bit for other cases, otherwise we can
queue for async retry and filemap will assume that we're armed and
return -EAGAIN instead of just blocking for the IO.
