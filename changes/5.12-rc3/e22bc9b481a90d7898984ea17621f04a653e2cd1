kernel: make IO threads unfreezable by default

The io-wq threads were already marked as no-freeze, but the manager was
not. On resume, we perpetually have signal_pending() being true, and
hence the manager will loop and spin 100% of the time.

Just mark the tasks created by create_io_thread() as PF_NOFREEZE by
default, and remove any knowledge of it in io-wq and io_uring.
