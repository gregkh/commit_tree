io_uring: Convert personality_idr to XArray

You can't call idr_remove() from within a idr_for_each() callback,
but you can call xa_erase() from an xa_for_each() loop, so switch the
entire personality_idr from the IDR to the XArray.  This manifests as a
use-after-free as idr_for_each() attempts to walk the rest of the node
after removing the last entry from it.
