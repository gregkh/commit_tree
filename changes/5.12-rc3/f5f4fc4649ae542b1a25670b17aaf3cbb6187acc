ia64: don't call handle_signal() unless there's actually a signal queued

Sergei and John both reported that ia64 failed to boot in 5.11, and it
was related to signals. Turns out the ia64 signal handling is a bit odd,
it doesn't check the return value of get_signal() for whether there's a
signal to deliver or not. With the introduction of TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL,
then task_work could trigger it.

Fix it by only calling handle_signal() if we actually have a real signal
to deliver. This brings it in line with all other archs, too.
