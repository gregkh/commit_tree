powerpc/kexec_file: fix FDT size estimation for kdump kernel

On systems with large amount of memory, loading kdump kernel through
kexec_file_load syscall may fail with the below error:

    "Failed to update fdt with linux,drconf-usable-memory property"

This happens because the size estimation for kdump kernel's FDT does
not account for the additional space needed to setup usable memory
properties. Fix it by accounting for the space needed to include
linux,usable-memory & linux,drconf-usable-memory properties while
estimating kdump kernel's FDT size.
