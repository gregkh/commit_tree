powerpc/32: Remove the counter in global_dbcr0

global_dbcr0 has two parts, 4 bytes to save/restore the
value of SPRN_DBCR0, and 4 bytes that are incremented/decremented
everytime something is saving/loading the above value.

This counter is only incremented/decremented, its value is never
used and never read.

Remove the counter and devide the size of global_dbcr0 by 2.
