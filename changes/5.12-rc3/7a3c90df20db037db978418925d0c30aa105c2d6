arch: powerpc: Stop building and using oprofile

The "oprofile" user-space tools don't use the kernel OPROFILE support
any more, and haven't in a long time. User-space has been converted to
the perf interfaces.

This commits stops building oprofile for powerpc and removes any
reference to it from directories in arch/powerpc/ apart from
arch/powerpc/oprofile, which will be removed in the next commit (this is
broken into two commits as the size of the commit became very big, ~5k
lines).

Note that the member "oprofile_cpu_type" in "struct cpu_spec" isn't
removed as it was also used by other parts of the code.
