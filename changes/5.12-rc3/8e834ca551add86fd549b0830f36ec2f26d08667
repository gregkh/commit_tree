scsi: ufs: Add "wb_on" sysfs node to control WB on/off

Currently UFS WriteBooster driver uses clock scaling up/down to set WB
on/off. For the platforms which don't support UFSHCD_CAP_CLK_SCALING, WB
will be always on. Provide a sysfs attribute to enable/disable WB during
runtime. Write 1/0 to "wb_on" sysfs node to enable/disable UFS WB.
