tools/resolve_btfids: Fix build error with older host toolchains

Older libelf.h and glibc elf.h might not yet define the ELF compression
types.

Checking and defining SHF_COMPRESSED fix the build error when compiling
with older toolchains. Also, the tool resolve_btfids is compiled with host
toolchain. The host toolchain is more likely to be older than the cross
compile toolchain.
