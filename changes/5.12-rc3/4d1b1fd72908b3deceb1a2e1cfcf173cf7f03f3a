coresight: etm4x: Clean up exception level masks

etm4_get_access_type() calculates the exception level bits
for use in address comparator registers. This is also used
by the TRCVICTLR register by shifting to the required position.

This patch cleans up the logic to make etm4_get_access_type()
calculate a generic mask which can be used by all users by
shifting to their field.

No functional changes intended.
