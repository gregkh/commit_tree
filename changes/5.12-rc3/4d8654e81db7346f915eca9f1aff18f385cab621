Goodix Fingerprint device is not a modem

The CDC ACM driver is false matching the Goodix Fingerprint device
against the USB_CDC_ACM_PROTO_AT_V25TER.

The Goodix Fingerprint device is a biometrics sensor that should be
handled in user-space. libfprint has some support for Goodix
fingerprint sensors, although not for this particular one. It is
possible that the vendor allocates a PID per OEM (Lenovo, Dell etc).
If this happens to be the case then more devices from the same vendor
could potentially match the ACM modem module table.
