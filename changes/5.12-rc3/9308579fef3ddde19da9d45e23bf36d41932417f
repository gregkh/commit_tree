MIPS: microMIPS: Fix the judgment of mm_jr16_op and mm_jalr_op

mm16_r5_format.rt is 5 bits, so directly judge the value if equal or not.
mm_jalr_op requires 7th to 16th bits. These 10 which bits generated by
shifting u_format.uimmediate by 6 may be affected by sign extension.
Thus, take out the 10 bits for comparison.

Without this patch, errors may occur, such as these bits are all ones.
