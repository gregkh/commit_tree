nexthop: Assert the invariant that a NH group is of only one type

Most of the code that deals with nexthop groups relies on the fact that the
group is of exactly one well-known type. Currently there is only one type,
"mpath", but as more next-hop group types come, it becomes desirable to
have a central place where the setting is validated. Introduce such place
into nexthop_create_group(), such that the check is done before the code
that relies on that invariant is invoked.
