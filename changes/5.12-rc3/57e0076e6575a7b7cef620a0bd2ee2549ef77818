zram: fix return value on writeback_store

writeback_store's return value is overwritten by submit_bio_wait's return
value.  Thus, writeback_store will return zero since there was no IO
error.  In the end, write syscall from userspace will see the zero as
return value, which could make the process stall to keep trying the write
until it will succeed.
