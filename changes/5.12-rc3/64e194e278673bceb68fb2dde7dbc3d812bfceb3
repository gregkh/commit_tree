drm/shmem-helpers: vunmap: Don't put pages for dma-buf

dma-buf importing was reworked in commit 7d2cd72a9aa3
("drm/shmem-helpers: Simplify dma-buf importing"). Before that commit
drm_gem_shmem_prime_import_sg_table() did set ->pages_use_count=1 and
drm_gem_shmem_vunmap_locked() could call drm_gem_shmem_put_pages()
unconditionally. Now without the use count set, put pages is called also
on dma-bufs. Fix this by only putting pages if it's not imported.
