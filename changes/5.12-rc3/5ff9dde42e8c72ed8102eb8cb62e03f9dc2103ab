ALSA: hda: Avoid spurious unsol event handling during S3/S4

When HD-audio bus receives unsolicited events during its system
suspend/resume (S3 and S4) phase, the controller driver may still try
to process events although the codec chips are already (or yet)
powered down.  This might screw up the codec communication, resulting
in CORB/RIRB errors.  Such events should be rather skipped, as the
codec chip status such as the jack status will be fully refreshed at
the system resume time.

Since we're tracking the system suspend/resume state in codec
power.power_state field, let's add the check in the common unsol event
handler entry point to filter out such events.
