KVM: arm64: Turn kvm_arm_support_pmu_v3() into a static key

We currently find out about the presence of a HW PMU (or the handling
of that PMU by perf, which amounts to the same thing) in a fairly
roundabout way, by checking the number of counters available to perf.
That's good enough for now, but we will soon need to find about about
that on paths where perf is out of reach (in the world switch).

Instead, let's turn kvm_arm_support_pmu_v3() into a static key.
