sched: Simplify migration_cpu_stop()

When affine_move_task() issues a migration_cpu_stop(), the purpose of
that function is to complete that @pending, not any random other
p->migration_pending that might have gotten installed since.

This realization much simplifies migration_cpu_stop() and allows
further necessary steps to fix all this as it provides the guarantee
that @pending's stopper will complete @pending (and not some random
other @pending).
