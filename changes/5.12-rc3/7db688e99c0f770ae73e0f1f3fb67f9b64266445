pstore/ram: Rate-limit "uncorrectable error in header" message

There is a quite huge "uncorrectable error in header" flood in KMSG
on a clean system boot since there is no pstore buffer saved in RAM.
Let's silence the redundant noisy messages by rate-limiting the printk
message. Now there are maximum 10 messages printed repeatedly instead
of 35+.
