I overlooked the issue because when I was working on the said commit,
only the front audio is tested. Apology for that.

Changing supports_autosuspend in driver is too late for disabling
autosuspend, because it was already used by USB probe routine, so it can
break the balance on the following code that depends on
supports_autosuspend.

Fix it by using usb_disable_autosuspend() helper, and balance the
suspend count in disconnect callback.
