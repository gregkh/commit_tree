drm/amdgpu/display: use GFP_ATOMIC in dcn21_validate_bandwidth_fp()

After fixing nested FPU contexts caused by 41401ac67791 we're still seeing
complaints about spurious kernel_fpu_end(). As it turns out this was
already fixed for dcn20 in commit f41ed88cbd ("drm/amdgpu/display:
use GFP_ATOMIC in dcn20_validate_bandwidth_internal") but never moved
forward to dcn21.
