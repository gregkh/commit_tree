nvme-hwmon: Return error code when registration fails

The hwmon pointer wont be NULL if the registration fails. Though the
exit code path will assign it to ctrl->hwmon_device. Later
nvme_hwmon_exit() will try to free the invalid pointer. Avoid this by
returning the error code from hwmon_device_register_with_info().
