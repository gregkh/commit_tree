brcmsmac: fix alignment constraints

sturct d11txh contains a ieee80211_rts structure, which is required to
have at least two byte alignment, and this conflicts with the __packed
attribute:

drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmsmac/d11.h:786:1: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct d11txh' is less than 2 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]

Mark d11txh itself as having two-byte alignment to ensure the
inner structure is properly aligned.
