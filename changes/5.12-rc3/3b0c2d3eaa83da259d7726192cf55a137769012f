Revert 95ebabde382c ("capabilities: Don't allow writing ambiguous v3 file capabilities")

It turns out that there are in fact userspace implementations that
care and this recent change caused a regression.

https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues/3071

As the motivation for the original change was future development,
and the impact is existing real world code just revert this change
and allow the ambiguity in v3 file caps.
