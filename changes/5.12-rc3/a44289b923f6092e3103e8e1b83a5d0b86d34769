drm/i915/lspcon: Create separate infoframe_enabled helper

Lspcon has Infoframes as well as DIP for HDR metadata(DRM Infoframe).
Create a separate mechanism for lspcon compared to HDMI in order to
address the same and ensure future scalability.

v2: Streamlined this as per Ville's suggestions, making sure that
HDMI infoframe versions are directly returned instead of a redundant
and confusing DIP overhead.
