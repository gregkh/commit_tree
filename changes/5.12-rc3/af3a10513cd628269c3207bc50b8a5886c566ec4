drivers: soc: atmel: add per soc id and version match masks

SAMA7G5 has different masks for chip ID and chip version on CIDR
register compared to previous AT91 SoCs. For this the commit adapts
the code for SAMA7G5 addition by introducing 2 new members in
struct at91_soc and fill them properly and also preparing the
parsing of proper DT binding.
