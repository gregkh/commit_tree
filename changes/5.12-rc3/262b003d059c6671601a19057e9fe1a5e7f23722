KVM: arm64: Fix exclusive limit for IPA size

When registering a memslot, we check the size and location of that
memslot against the IPA size to ensure that we can provide guest
access to the whole of the memory.

Unfortunately, this check rejects memslot that end-up at the exact
limit of the addressing capability for a given IPA size. For example,
it refuses the creation of a 2GB memslot at 0x8000000 with a 32bit
IPA space.

Fix it by relaxing the check to accept a memslot reaching the
limit of the IPA space.
