io_uring: move cred assignment into io_issue_sqe()

If we move it in there, then we no longer have to care about it in io-wq.
This means we can drop the cred handling in io-wq, and we can drop the
REQ_F_WORK_INITIALIZED flag and async init functions as that was the last
user of it since we moved to the new workers. Then we can also drop
io_wq_work->creds, and just hold the personality u16 in there instead.
