regulator: qcom-rpmh-regulator: add pm8009-1 chip revision

PM8009 has special revision (P=1), which is to be used for sm8250
platform. The major difference is the S2 regulator which supplies 0.95 V
instead of 2.848V. Declare regulators data to be used for this chip
revision. The datasheet calls the chip just pm8009-1, so use the same
name.
