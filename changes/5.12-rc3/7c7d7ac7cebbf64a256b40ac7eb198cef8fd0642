HID: hid-input: avoid splitting keyboard, system and consumer controls

A typical USB keyboard usually splits its keys into several reports:

- one for the basic alphanumeric keys, modifier keys, F<n> keys, six pack
  keys and keypad. This report's application is normally listed as
  GenericDesktop.Keyboard
- a GenericDesktop.SystemControl report for the system control keys, such
  as power and sleep
- Consumer.ConsumerControl report for multimedia (forward, rewind,
  play/pause, mute, etc) and other extended keys.
- additional output, vendor specific, and feature reports

Splitting each report into a separate input device is wasteful and even
hurts userspace as it makes it harder to determine the true capabilities
(set of available keys) of a keyboard, so let's adjust application
matching to merge system control and consumer control reports with
keyboard report, if one has already been processed.
