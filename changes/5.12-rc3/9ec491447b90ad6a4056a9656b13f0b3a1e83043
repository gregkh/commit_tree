block: Suppress uevent for hidden device when removed

register_disk() suppress uevents for devices with the GENHD_FL_HIDDEN
but enables uevents at the end again in order to announce disk after
possible partitions are created.

When the device is removed the uevents are still on and user land sees
'remove' messages for devices which were never 'add'ed to the system.

  KERNEL[95481.571887] remove   /devices/virtual/nvme-fabrics/ctl/nvme5/nvme0c5n1 (block)

Let's suppress the uevents for GENHD_FL_HIDDEN by not enabling the
uevents at all.
