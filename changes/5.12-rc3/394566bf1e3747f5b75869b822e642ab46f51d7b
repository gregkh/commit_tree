Bluetooth: advmon offload MSFT handle filter enablement

Implements the feature to disable/enable the filter used for
advertising monitor on MSFT controller, effectively have the same
effect as "remove all monitors" and "add all previously removed
monitors".

This feature would be needed when suspending, where we would not want
to get packets from anything outside the allowlist. Note that the
integration with the suspending part is not included in this patch.
