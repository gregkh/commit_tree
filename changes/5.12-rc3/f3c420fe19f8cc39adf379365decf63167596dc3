drm/vc4: kms: Convert to atomic helpers

Now that the semaphore is gone, our atomic_commit implementation is
basically drm_atomic_helper_commit with a somewhat custom commit_tail,
the main difference being that we're using wait_for_flip_done instead of
wait_for_vblanks used in the drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail helper.

Let's switch to using drm_atomic_helper_commit.
