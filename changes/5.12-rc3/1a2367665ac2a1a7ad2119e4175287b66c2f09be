ip_gre: remove CRC flag from dev features in gre_gso_segment

This patch is to let it always do CRC checksum in sctp_gso_segment()
by removing CRC flag from the dev features in gre_gso_segment() for
SCTP over GRE, just as it does in Commit 527beb8ef9c0 ("udp: support
sctp over udp in skb_udp_tunnel_segment") for SCTP over UDP.

It could set csum/csum_start in GSO CB properly in sctp_gso_segment()
after that commit, so it would do checksum with gso_make_checksum()
in gre_gso_segment(), and Commit 622e32b7d4a6 ("net: gre: recompute
gre csum for sctp over gre tunnels") can be reverted now.

Note that when need_csum is false, we can still leave CRC checksum
of SCTP to HW by not clearing this CRC flag if it's supported, as
Jakub and Alex noticed.

v1->v2:
  - improve the changelog.
  - fix "rev xmas tree" in varibles declaration.
v2->v3:
  - remove CRC flag from dev features only when need_csum is true.
