KVM: arm64: Fix nVHE hyp panic host context restore

When panicking from the nVHE hyp and restoring the host context, x29 is
expected to hold a pointer to the host context. This wasn't being done
so fix it to make sure there's a valid pointer the host context being
used.

Rather than passing a boolean indicating whether or not the host context
should be restored, instead pass the pointer to the host context. NULL
is passed to indicate that no context should be restored.
