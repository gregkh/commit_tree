net: phy: rename PHY_IGNORE_INTERRUPT to PHY_MAC_INTERRUPT

Some internal PHY's have their events like link change reported by the
MAC interrupt. We have PHY_IGNORE_INTERRUPT to deal with this scenario.
I'm not too happy with this name. We don't ignore interrupts, typically
there is no interrupt exposed at a PHY level. So let's rename it to
PHY_MAC_INTERRUPT. This is in line with phy_mac_interrupt(), which is
called from the MAC interrupt handler to handle PHY events.
