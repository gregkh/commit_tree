KVM: x86: hyper-v: Introduce to_kvm_hv() helper

Spelling '&kvm->arch.hyperv' correctly is hard. Also, this makes the code
more consistent with vmx/svm where to_kvm_vmx()/to_kvm_svm() are already
being used.

Opportunistically change kvm_hv_msr_{get,set}_crash_{data,ctl}() and
kvm_hv_msr_set_crash_data() to take 'kvm' instead of 'vcpu' as these
MSRs are partition wide.

No functional change intended.
