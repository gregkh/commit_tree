PCI: xgene: Fix CRS SV comment

Configuration Request Retry Status ("CRS") must be supported by all PCIe
devices.  CRS Software Visibility is an optional feature that enables a
Root Port to make CRS visible to software by returning a special data value
to complete a config read.

Clarify a comment to say that it is "CRS SV", not "CRS", that can be
enabled.
