kbuild: dummy-tools: support MPROFILE_KERNEL checks for ppc

ppc64le checks for -mprofile-kernel to define MPROFILE_KERNEL Kconfig.
Kconfig calls arch/powerpc/tools/gcc-check-mprofile-kernel.sh for that
purpose. This script performs two checks:
1) build with -mprofile-kernel should contain "_mcount"
2) build with -mprofile-kernel with a function marked as "notrace"
   should not produce "_mcount"

So support this in dummy-tools' gcc, so that we have MPROFILE_KERNEL
always true.
