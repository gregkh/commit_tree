habanalabs: fix debugfs address translation

when user uses virtual addresses to access dram through debugfs,
driver translate this address to physical and use it
for the access through the pcie bar.
in case dram page size is different than the dmmu
page size, we need to have special treatment
for adding the page offset to the actual address, which
is to use the dram page size mask to fetch the page offset
from the virtual address, instead of the dmmu last hop shift.
