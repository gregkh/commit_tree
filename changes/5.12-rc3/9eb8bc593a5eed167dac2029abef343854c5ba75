net: dsa: tag_rtl4_a: fix egress tags

Commit 86dd9868b878 has several issues, but was accepted too soon
before anyone could take a look.

- Double free. dsa_slave_xmit() will free the skb if the xmit function
  returns NULL, but the skb is already freed by eth_skb_pad(). Use
  __skb_put_padto() to avoid that.
- Unnecessary allocation. It has been done by DSA core since commit
  a3b0b6479700.
- A u16 pointer points to skb data. It should be __be16 for network
  byte order.
- Typo in comments. "numer" -> "number".
