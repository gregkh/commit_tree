crypto: keembay-ocs-aes - Fix 'q' assignment during CCM B0 generation

In ocs_aes_ccm_write_b0(), 'q' (the octet length of the binary
representation of the octet length of the payload) is set to 'iv[0]',
while it should be set to 'iv[0] & 0x7' (i.e., only the last 3
bits of iv[0] should be used), as documented in NIST Special Publication
800-38C:
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38c.pdf

In practice, this is not an issue, since 'iv[0]' is checked to be in the
range [1-7] by ocs_aes_validate_inputs(), but let's fix the assignment
anyway, in order to make the code more robust.
