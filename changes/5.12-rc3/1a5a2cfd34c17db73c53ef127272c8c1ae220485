gfs2: fix use-after-free in trans_drain

This patch adds code to function trans_drain to remove drained
bd elements from the ail lists, if queued, before freeing the bd.
If we don't remove the bd from the ail, function ail_drain will
try to reference the bd after it has been freed by trans_drain.

Thanks to Andy Price for his analysis of the problem.
