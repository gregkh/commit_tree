arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Disable some components by default

Some components (like PCIe) are not used on all devices and
with a certain firmware configuration they might end up triggering
a force reboot or a Synchronous Abort.

This commit brings no functional difference as the nodes are
enabled on devices which didn't disable them previously.
