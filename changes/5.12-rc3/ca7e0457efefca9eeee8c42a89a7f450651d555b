hugetlb: break earlier in add_reservation_in_range() when we can

All the regions maintained in hugetlb reserved map is inclusive on "from"
but exclusive on "to".  We can break earlier even if rg->from==t because
it already means no possible intersection.

This does not need a Fixes in all cases because when it happens
(rg->from==t) we'll not break out of the loop while we should, however the
next thing we'd do is still add the last file_region we'd need and quit
the loop in the next round.  So this change is not a bugfix (since the old
code should still run okay iiuc), but we'd better still touch it up to
make it logically sane.
