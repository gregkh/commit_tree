Drivers: hv: vmbus: Restrict vmbus_devices on isolated guests

Only the VSCs or ICs that have been hardened and that are critical for

guest is running isolated.  This change reduces the footprint of the
code that will be exercised by Confidential VMs and hence the exposure
to bugs and vulnerabilities.
