io_uring: move to using create_io_thread()

This allows us to do task creation and setup without needing to use
completions to try and synchronize with the starting thread. Get rid of
the old io_wq_fork_thread() wrapper, and the 'wq' and 'worker' startup
completion events - we can now do setup before the task is running.
