kasan: fix KASAN_STACK dependency for HW_TAGS

There's a runtime failure when running HW_TAGS-enabled kernel built with
GCC on hardware that doesn't support MTE.  GCC-built kernels always have
CONFIG_KASAN_STACK enabled, even though stack instrumentation isn't
supported by HW_TAGS.  Having that config enabled causes KASAN to issue
MTE-only instructions to unpoison kernel stacks, which causes the failure.

Fix the issue by disallowing CONFIG_KASAN_STACK when HW_TAGS is used.

(The commit that introduced CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS specified proper
 dependency for CONFIG_KASAN_STACK_ENABLE but not for CONFIG_KASAN_STACK.)
