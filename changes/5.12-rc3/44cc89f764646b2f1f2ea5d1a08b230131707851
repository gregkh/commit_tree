PM: runtime: Update device status before letting suppliers suspend

Because the PM-runtime status of the device is not updated in
__rpm_callback(), attempts to suspend the suppliers of the given
device triggered by rpm_put_suppliers() called by it may fail.

Fix this by making __rpm_callback() update the device's status to
RPM_SUSPENDED before calling rpm_put_suppliers() if the current
status of the device is RPM_SUSPENDING and the callback just invoked
by it has returned 0 (success).

While at it, modify the code in __rpm_callback() to always check
the device's PM-runtime status under its PM lock.
