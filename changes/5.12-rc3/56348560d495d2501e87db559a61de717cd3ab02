debugfs: do not attempt to create a new file before the filesystem is initalized

Some subsystems want to add debugfs files at early boot, way before
debugfs is initialized.  This seems to work somehow as the vfs layer
will not allow it to happen, but let's be explicit and test to ensure we
are properly up and running before allowing files to be created.
