perf archive: Fix filtering of empty build-ids

A non-existent build-id used to be treated as all-zero SHA-1 hash.
Build-ids are now variable width. A non-existent build-id is an empty
string and "perf buildid-list" pads this with spaces. This is true even
when using old perf.data files recorded from older versions of perf;
"perf buildid-list" never reports an all-zero hash anymore.

This fixes "perf-archive" to skip missing build-ids by skipping lines
that start with a padding space rather than with zeroes.
