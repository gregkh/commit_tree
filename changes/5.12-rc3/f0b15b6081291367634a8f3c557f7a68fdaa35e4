MAINTAINERS: exclude uapi directories in API/ABI section

Commit 7b4693e644cb ("MAINTAINERS: add uapi directories to API/ABI
section") added include/uapi/ and arch/*/include/uapi/ so that patches
modifying them CC linux-api.  However that was already done in the past
and resulted in too much noise and thus later removed, as explained in
b14fd334ff3d ("MAINTAINERS: trim the file triggers for ABI/API")

To prevent another round of addition and removal in the future, change the
entries to X: (explicit exclusion) for documentation purposes, although
they are not subdirectories of broader included directories, as there is
apparently no defined way to add plain comments in subsystem sections.
