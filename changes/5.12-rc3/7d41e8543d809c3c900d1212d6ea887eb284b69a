io_uring: remove indirect ctx into sqo injection

We use ->ctx_new_list to notify sqo about new ctx pending, then sqo
should stop and splice it to its sqd->ctx_list, paired with
->sq_thread_comp.

The last one is broken because nobody reinitialises it, and trying to
fix it would only add more complexity and bugs. And the first isn't
really needed as is done under park(), that protects from races well.
Add ctx into sqd->ctx_list directly (under park()), it's much simpler
and allows to kill both, ctx_new_list and sq_thread_comp.

note: apparently there is no real problem at the moment, because
sq_thread_comp is used only by io_sq_thread_finish() followed by
parking, where list_del(&ctx->sqd_list) removes it well regardless
whether it's in the new or the active list.
