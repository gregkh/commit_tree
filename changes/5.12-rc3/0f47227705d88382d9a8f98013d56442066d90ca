block: revert "block: fix bd_size_lock use"

With the removal of the skd driver, using IRQ safe locking of a bdev
bd_size_lock spinlock to protect the bdev inode size is not necessary
anymore as there is no other known driver using this lock under an IRQ
disabled context (e.g. calling set_capacity() with IRQ disabled).
Revert commit 0fe37724f8e7 ("block: fix bd_size_lock use") which
introduced the IRQ safe change.
