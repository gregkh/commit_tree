chelsio: cxgb: Disable the card on error in threaded interrupt

t1_fatal_err() is invoked from the interrupt handler. The bad part is
that it invokes (via t1_sge_stop()) del_timer_sync() and tasklet_kill().
Both functions must not be called from an interrupt because it is
possible that it will wait for the completion of the timer/tasklet it
just interrupted.

In case of a fatal error, use t1_interrupts_disable() to disable all
interrupt sources and then wake the interrupt thread with
F_PL_INTR_SGE_ERR as pending flag. The threaded-interrupt will stop the
card via t1_sge_stop() and not re-enable the interrupts again.
