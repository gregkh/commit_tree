jump_label: Do not profile branch annotations

While running my branch profiler that checks for incorrect "likely" and
"unlikely"s around the kernel, there's a large number of them that are
incorrect due to being "static_branches".

As static_branches are rather special, as they are likely or unlikely for
other reasons than normal annotations are used for, there's no reason to
have them be profiled.

Expose the "unlikely_notrace" and "likely_notrace" so that the
static_branch can use them, and have them be ignored by the branch
profilers.
