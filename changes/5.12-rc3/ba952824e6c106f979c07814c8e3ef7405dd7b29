PCI/portdrv: Report reset for frozen channel

The PCI error recovery always resets the link for a frozen state, so the
port driver should return that a reset is required for its result. This
will get the .slot_reset() callback invoked, which is necessary to
restore the port's config space. Without this, the driver had been
relying on downstream drivers to return this status.
