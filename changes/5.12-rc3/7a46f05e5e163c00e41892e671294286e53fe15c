drm/amd/display: Add a backlight module option

There seem devices that don't work with the aux channel backlight
control.  For allowing such users to test with the other backlight
control method, provide a new module option, aux_backlight, to specify
enabling or disabling the aux backport support explicitly.  As
default, the aux support is detected by the hardware capability.

v2: make the backlight option generic in case we add future
backlight types (Alex)
