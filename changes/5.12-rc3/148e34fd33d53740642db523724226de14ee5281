staging: comedi: pcl818: Fix endian problem for AI command data

The analog input subdevice supports Comedi asynchronous commands that
use Comedi's 16-bit sample format.  However, the call to
`comedi_buf_write_samples()` is passing the address of a 32-bit integer
parameter.  On bigendian machines, this will copy 2 bytes from the wrong
end of the 32-bit value.  Fix it by changing the type of the parameter
holding the sample value to `unsigned short`.

[Note: the bug was introduced in commit edf4537bcbf5 ("staging: comedi:
pcl818: use comedi_buf_write_samples()") but the patch applies better to
commit d615416de615 ("staging: comedi: pcl818: introduce
pcl818_ai_write_sample()").]
