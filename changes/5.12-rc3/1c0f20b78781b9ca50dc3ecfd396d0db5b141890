staging: comedi: das6402: Fix endian problem for AI command data

The analog input subdevice supports Comedi asynchronous commands that
use Comedi's 16-bit sample format.  However, the call to
`comedi_buf_write_samples()` is passing the address of a 32-bit integer
variable.  On bigendian machines, this will copy 2 bytes from the wrong
end of the 32-bit value.  Fix it by changing the type of the variable
holding the sample value to `unsigned short`.
