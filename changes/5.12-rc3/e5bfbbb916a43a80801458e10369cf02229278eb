dmaengine: rcar-dmac: Add support for R-Car V3U

The DMACs (both SYS-DMAC and RT-DMAC) on R-Car V3U differ slightly from
the DMACs on R-Car Gen2 and other R-Car Gen3 SoCs:
  1. The per-channel registers are located in a second register block.
     Add support for mapping the second block, using the appropriate
     offsets and stride.
  2. The common Channel Clear Register (DMACHCLR) was replaced by a
     per-channel register.
     Update rcar_dmac_chan_clear{,_all}() to handle this.
     As rcar_dmac_init() needs to clear the status before the individual
     channels are probed, channel index and base address initialization
     are moved forward.
