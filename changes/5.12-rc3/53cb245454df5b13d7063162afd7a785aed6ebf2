NFSv4.2: fix return value of _nfs4_get_security_label()

An xattr 'get' handler is expected to return the length of the value on
success, yet _nfs4_get_security_label() (and consequently also
nfs4_xattr_get_nfs4_label(), which is used as an xattr handler) returns
just 0 on success.

Fix this by returning label.len instead, which contains the length of
the result.
