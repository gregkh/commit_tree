powerpc/64s: Use symbolic macros for function entry encoding

In ppc_function_entry() we look for a specific set of instructions by
masking the instructions and comparing with a known value. Currently
those known values are just literal hex values, and we recently
discovered one of them was wrong.

Instead construct the values using the existing constants we have for
defining various fields of instructions.
