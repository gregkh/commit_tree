spi: Add SPI_NO_TX/RX support

Transmit/receive only is a valid SPI mode. For example, the MOSI/TX line
might be missing from an ADC while for a DAC the MISO/RX line may be
optional. This patch adds these two new modes: SPI_NO_TX and
SPI_NO_RX. This way, the drivers will be able to identify if any of
these two lines is missing and to adjust the transfers accordingly.
