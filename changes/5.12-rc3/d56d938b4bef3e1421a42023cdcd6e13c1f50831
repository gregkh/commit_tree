io_uring: do ctx initiated file note removal

Another preparation patch. When full quiesce is done on ctx exit, use
task_work infra to remove corresponding to the ctx io_uring->xa entries.
For that we use the back tctx map. Also use ->in_idle to prevent
removing it while we traversing ->xa on cancellation, just ignore it.
