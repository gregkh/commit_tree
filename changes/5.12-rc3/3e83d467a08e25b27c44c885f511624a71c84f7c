s390/qeth: schedule TX NAPI on QAOB completion

When a QAOB notifies us that a pending TX buffer has been delivered, the
actual TX completion processing by qeth_tx_complete_pending_bufs()
is done within the context of a TX NAPI instance. We shouldn't rely on
this instance being scheduled by some other TX event, but just do it
ourselves.

qeth_qdio_handle_aob() is called from qeth_poll(), ie. our main NAPI
instance. To avoid touching the TX queue's NAPI instance
before/after it is (un-)registered, reorder the code in qeth_open()
and qeth_stop() accordingly.
