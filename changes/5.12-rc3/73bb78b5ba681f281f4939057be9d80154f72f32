drm/i915/pps: abstract intel_pps_encoder_reset()

Add an "encoder reset" call to hide some more pps functions, and clean
up the callers. A minor functional change is not holding the pps lock
across the whole operation in intel_dp_encoder_reset, but instead doing
it in two steps.

v2: rename intel_pps_reinit to intel_pps_encoder_reset for clarity
