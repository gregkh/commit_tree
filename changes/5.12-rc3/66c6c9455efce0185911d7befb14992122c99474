dmaengine: dw-axi-dmac: Add device_config operation

Add device_config() callback function so that the device address
can be passed to the dma driver.

DMA clients use this interface to pass in the device address to the
AxiDMA. Without this interface, data transfer between device to memory
and memory to device would failed.
