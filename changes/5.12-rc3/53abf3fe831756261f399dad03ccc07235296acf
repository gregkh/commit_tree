coresight: etm-perf: Clarify comment on perf options

In theory, the options should be arbitrary values and are neutral for
any ETM version; so far perf tool uses ETMv3.5/PTM ETMCR config bits
except for register's bit definitions, also uses as options.

This can introduce confusion, especially if we want to add a new option
but the new option is not supported by ETMv3.5/PTM ETMCR.  But on the
other hand, we cannot change options since these options are generic
CoreSight PMU ABI.

For easier maintenance and avoid confusion, this patch refines the
comment to clarify perf options, and gives out the background info for
these bits are coming from ETMv3.5/PTM.  Afterwards, we should take
these options as general knobs, and if there have any confliction with
ETMv3.5/PTM, should consider to define saperate macros for ETMv3.5/PTM
ETMCR config bits.
