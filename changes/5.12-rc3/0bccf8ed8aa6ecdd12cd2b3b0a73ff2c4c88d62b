nexthop: Extract a helper for validation of get/del RTNL requests

Validation of messages for get / del of a next hop is the same as will be
validation of messages for get of a resilient next hop group bucket. The
difference is that policy for resilient next hop group buckets is a
superset of that used for next-hop get.

It is therefore possible to reuse the code that validates the nhmsg fields,
extracts the next-hop ID, and validates that. To that end, extract from
nh_valid_get_del_req() a helper __nh_valid_get_del_req() that does just
that.

Make the nlh argument const so that the function can be called from the
dump context, which only has a const nlh. Propagate the constness to
nh_valid_get_del_req().
