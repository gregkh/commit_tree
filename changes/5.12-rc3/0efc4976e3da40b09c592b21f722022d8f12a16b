gfs2: bypass log flush if the journal is not live

Patch fe3e397668775 ("gfs2: Rework the log space allocation logic")
changed gfs2_log_flush to reserve a set of journal blocks in case no
transaction is active.  However, gfs2_log_flush also gets called in
cases where we don't have an active journal, for example, for spectator
mounts.  In that case, trying to reserve blocks would sleep forever, but
we want gfs2_log_flush to be a no-op instead.
