kbuild: rebuild GCC plugins when the compiler is upgraded

Linus reported a build error due to the GCC plugin incompatibility
when the compiler is upgraded. [1]

GCC plugins are tied to a particular GCC version. So, they must be
rebuilt when the compiler is upgraded.

This seems to be a long-standing flaw since the initial support of
GCC plugins.

Extend commit 8b59cd81dc5e ("kbuild: ensure full rebuild when the
compiler is updated"), so that GCC plugins are covered by the
compiler upgrade detection.
