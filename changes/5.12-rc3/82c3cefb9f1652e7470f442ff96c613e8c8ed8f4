iommu: Don't use lazy flush for untrusted device

The lazy IOTLB flushing setup leaves a time window, in which the device
can still access some system memory, which has already been unmapped by
the device driver. It's not suitable for untrusted devices. A malicious
device might use this to attack the system by obtaining data that it
shouldn't obtain.
