sched/fair: Remove SIS_AVG_CPU

SIS_AVG_CPU was introduced as a means of avoiding a search when the
average search cost indicated that the search would likely fail. It was
a blunt instrument and disabled by commit 4c77b18cf8b7 ("sched/fair: Make
select_idle_cpu() more aggressive") and later replaced with a proportional
search depth by commit 1ad3aaf3fcd2 ("sched/core: Implement new approach
to scale select_idle_cpu()").

While there are corner cases where SIS_AVG_CPU is better, it has now been
disabled for almost three years. As the intent of SIS_PROP is to reduce
the time complexity of select_idle_cpu(), lets drop SIS_AVG_CPU and focus
on SIS_PROP as a throttling mechanism.
