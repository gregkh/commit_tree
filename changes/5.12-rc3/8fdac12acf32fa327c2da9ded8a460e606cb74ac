net/mlx5: DR, Copy all 64B whenever replacing STE in the head of miss-list

Till now the code assumed that need to copy reduced size of the
ste because the rest is the mask part which shouldn't be changed.
This is not true for all types of HW (like STEv1).
Take all 64B from the new STE and write them in the replaced STE place.
This change will make it easier to handle all STE HW types because we have
all the data that is about to be written into HW.
