HID: playstation: add DualSense classic rumble support.

The DualSense features a haptics system based on voicecoil motors,
which requires PCM data (or special HID packets using Bluetooth). There
is no appropriate API yet in the Linux kernel to expose these. The
controller also provides a classic rumble feature for backwards
compatibility. Expose this classic rumble feature using the FF framework.
