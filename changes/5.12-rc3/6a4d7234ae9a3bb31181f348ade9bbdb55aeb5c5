net: fec: ptp: avoid register access when ipg clock is disabled

When accessing the timecounter register on an i.MX8MQ the kernel hangs.
This is only the case when the interface is down. This can be reproduced
by reading with 'phc_ctrl eth0 get'.

Like described in the change in 91c0d987a9788dcc5fe26baafd73bf9242b68900
the igp clock is disabled when the interface is down and leads to a
system hang.

So we check if the ptp clock status before reading the timecounter
register.
