PCI: endpoint: Add support to associate secondary EPC with EPF

In the case of standard endpoint functions, only one endpoint controller
(EPC) will be associated with an endpoint function (EPF). However for
providing NTB (non transparent bridge) functionality, two EPCs should be
associated with a single EPF.  Add support to associate secondary EPC with
EPF. This is in preparation for adding NTB endpoint function driver.
