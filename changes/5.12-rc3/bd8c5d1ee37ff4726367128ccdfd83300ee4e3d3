ACPI: battery: Clean up printing messages

Replace the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() and ACPI_EXCEPTION() instances
in battery.c with acpi_handle_debug() and acpi_handle_info() calls,
respectively, which among other things causes the excessive log
level of the messages previously printed via ACPI_EXCEPTION() to
be increased.

Drop the _COMPONENT and ACPI_MODULE_NAME() definitions that are not
used any more, drop the no longer needed ACPI_BATTERY_COMPONENT
definition from the headers and update the documentation accordingly.

While at it, update the pr_fmt() definition and drop the unneeded
PREFIX sybmbol definition from battery.c.  Also adapt the existing
pr_info() calls to the new pr_fmt() definition.
