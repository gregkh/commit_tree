staging: rtl8192e: fix bool comparison in expressions

There are certain conditional expressions in rtl8192e, where a boolean
variable is compared with true/false, in forms such as (foo == true) or
(false != bar), which does not comply with checkpatch.pl (CHECK:
BOOL_COMPARISON), according to which boolean variables should be
themselves used in the condition, rather than comparing with true/false

E.g. in drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtl8192e/r8192E_dev.c,
"if (Type == true)" can be replaced with: "if (Type)"

Replace all such expressions with the bool variables appropriately
