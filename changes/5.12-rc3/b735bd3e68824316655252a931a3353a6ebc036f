objtool: Combine UNWIND_HINT_RET_OFFSET and UNWIND_HINT_FUNC

The ORC metadata generated for UNWIND_HINT_FUNC isn't actually very
func-like.  With certain usages it can cause stack state mismatches
because it doesn't set the return address (CFI_RA).

Also, users of UNWIND_HINT_RET_OFFSET no longer need to set a custom
return stack offset.  Instead they just need to specify a func-like
situation, so the current ret_offset code is hacky for no good reason.

Solve both problems by simplifying the RET_OFFSET handling and
converting it into a more useful UNWIND_HINT_FUNC.

If we end up needing the old 'ret_offset' functionality again in the
future, we should be able to support it pretty easily with the addition
of a custom 'sp_offset' in UNWIND_HINT_FUNC.
