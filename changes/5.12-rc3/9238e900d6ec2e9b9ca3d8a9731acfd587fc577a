mptcp: free resources when the port number is mismatched

When the port number is mismatched with the announced ones, use
'goto dispose_child' to free the resources instead of using 'goto out'.

This patch also moves the port number checking code in
subflow_syn_recv_sock before mptcp_finish_join, otherwise subflow_drop_ctx
will fail in dispose_child.
