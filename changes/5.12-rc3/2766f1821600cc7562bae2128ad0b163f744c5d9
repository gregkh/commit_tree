zram: fix broken page writeback

commit 0d8359620d9b ("zram: support page writeback") introduced two
problems.  It overwrites writeback_store's return value as kstrtol's
return value, which makes return value zero so user could see zero as
return value of write syscall even though it wrote data successfully.

It also breaks index value in the loop in that it doesn't increase the
index any longer.  It means it can write only first starting block index
so user couldn't write all idle pages in the zram so lose memory saving
chance.

This patch fixes those issues.
