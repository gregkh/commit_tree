io_uring: add io_disarm_next() helper

A preparation patch placing all preparations before extracting a next
request into a separate helper io_disarm_next().

Also, don't spuriously do ev_posted in a rare case where REQ_F_FAIL_LINK
is set but there are no requests linked (i.e. after cancelling a linked
timeout or setting IOSQE_IO_LINK on a last request of a submission
batch).
