futex: Change utime parameter to be 'const ... *'

futex(2) says that 'utime' is a pointer to 'const'.  The implementation
doesn't use 'const'; however, it _never_ modifies the contents of utime.

- futex() either uses 'utime' as a pointer to struct or as a 'u32'.

- In case it's used as a 'u32', it makes a copy of it, and of course it is
  not dereferenced.

- In case it's used as a 'struct __kernel_timespec __user *', the pointer
  is not dereferenced inside the futex() definition, and it is only passed
  to a function: get_timespec64(), which accepts a 'const struct
  __kernel_timespec __user *'.

[ tglx: Make the same change to the compat syscall and fixup the prototypes. ]
