net: bridge: multicast: add EHT structures and definitions

Add EHT structures for tracking hosts and sources per group. We keep one
set for each host which has all of the host's S,G entries, and one set for
each multicast source which has all hosts that have joined that S,G. For
each host, source entry we record the filter_mode and we keep an expiry
timer. There is also one global expiry timer per source set, it is
updated with each set entry update, it will be later used to lower the
set's timer instead of lowering each entry's timer separately.
