net: enetc: set MAC RX FIFO to recommended value

On LS1028A, the MAC RX FIFO defaults to the value 2, which is too high
and may lead to RX lock-up under traffic at a rate higher than 6 Gbps.
Set it to 1 instead, as recommended by the hardware design team and by
later versions of the ENETC block guide.
