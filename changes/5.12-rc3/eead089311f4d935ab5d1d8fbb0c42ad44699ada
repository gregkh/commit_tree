powerpc/4xx: Fix build errors from mfdcr()

lkp reported a build error in fsp2.o:

  CC      arch/powerpc/platforms/44x/fsp2.o
  {standard input}:577: Error: unsupported relocation against base

Which comes from:

  pr_err("GESR0: 0x%08x\n", mfdcr(base + PLB4OPB_GESR0));

Where our mfdcr() macro is stringifying "base + PLB4OPB_GESR0", and
passing that to the assembler, which obviously doesn't work.

The mfdcr() macro already checks that the argument is constant using
__builtin_constant_p(), and if not calls the out-of-line version of
mfdcr(). But in this case GCC is smart enough to notice that "base +
PLB4OPB_GESR0" will be constant, even though it's not something we can
immediately stringify into a register number.

Segher pointed out that passing the register number to the inline asm
as a constant would be better, and in fact it fixes the build error,
presumably because it gives GCC a chance to resolve the value.

While we're at it, change mtdcr() similarly.
