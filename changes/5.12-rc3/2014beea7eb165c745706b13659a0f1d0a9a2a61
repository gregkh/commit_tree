net: move net_set_todo inside rollback_registered()

Commit 93ee31f14f6f ("[NET]: Fix free_netdev on register_netdev
failure.") moved net_set_todo() outside of rollback_registered()
so that rollback_registered() can be used in the failure path of
register_netdevice() but without risking a double free.

Since commit cf124db566e6 ("net: Fix inconsistent teardown and
release of private netdev state."), however, we have a better
way of handling that condition, since destructors don't call
free_netdev() directly.

After the change in commit c269a24ce057 ("net: make free_netdev()
more lenient with unregistering devices") we can now move
net_set_todo() back.
