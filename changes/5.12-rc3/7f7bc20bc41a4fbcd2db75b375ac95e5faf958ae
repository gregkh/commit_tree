nios2: Don't use _end for calculating min_low_pfn

If there is a initramfs linked into the kernel which will be
freed later on there is free memory somewhere between _etext
and _end, thus using _end for min_low_pfn is not correct.
This may lead to issues in dma_capable when checking
'min(addr, end) < phys_to_dma(dev, PFN_PHYS(min_low_pfn)))'
as the address addr might be below min_low_pfn. Picked
find_limits from architecture arm for applying min_low_pfn and
max_low_pfn. Maybe using _etext for min_low_pfn would be
fine too.
