net: enetc: fix incorrect TPID when receiving 802.1ad tagged packets

When the enetc ports have rx-vlan-offload enabled, they report a TPID of
ETH_P_8021Q regardless of what was actually in the packet. When
rx-vlan-offload is disabled, packets have the proper TPID. Fix this
inconsistency by finishing the TODO left in the code.
