powerpc/64s: Remove EXSLB interrupt save area

SLB faults should not be taken while the PACA save areas are live, all
memory accesses should be fetches from the kernel text, and access to
PACA and the current stack, before C code is called or any other
accesses are made.

All of these have pinned SLBs so will not take a SLB fault. Therefore
EXSLB is not be required.
