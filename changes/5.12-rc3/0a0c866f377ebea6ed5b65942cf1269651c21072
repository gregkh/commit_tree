mmc: cqhci: add cqhci_host_ops::program_key

On Snapdragon SoCs, the Linux kernel isn't permitted to directly access
the standard CQHCI crypto configuration registers.  Instead, programming
and evicting keys must be done through vendor-specific SMC calls.

To support this hardware, add a ->program_key() method to
'struct cqhci_host_ops'.  This allows overriding the standard CQHCI
crypto key programming / eviction procedure.

This is inspired by the corresponding UFS crypto support, which uses
these same SMC calls.  See commit 1bc726e26ef3 ("scsi: ufs: Add
program_key() variant op").
