hugetlbfs: remove meaningless variable avoid_reserve

The variable avoid_reserve is meaningless because we never changed its
value and just passed it to alloc_huge_page().  So remove it to make code
more clear that in hugetlbfs_fallocate, we never avoid reserve when alloc
hugepage yet.  Also add a comment offered by Mike Kravetz to explain this.
