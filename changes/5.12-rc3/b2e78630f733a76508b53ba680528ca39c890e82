staging: comedi: adv_pci1710: Fix endian problem for AI command data

The analog input subdevice supports Comedi asynchronous commands that
use Comedi's 16-bit sample format.  However, the calls to
`comedi_buf_write_samples()` are passing the address of a 32-bit integer
variable.  On bigendian machines, this will copy 2 bytes from the wrong
end of the 32-bit value.  Fix it by changing the type of the variables
holding the sample value to `unsigned short`.  The type of the `val`
parameter of `pci1710_ai_read_sample()` is changed to `unsigned short *`
accordingly.  The type of the `val` variable in `pci1710_ai_insn_read()`
is also changed to `unsigned short` since its address is passed to
`pci1710_ai_read_sample()`.
