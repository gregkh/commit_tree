can: mcp251xfd: mcp251xfd_hw_rx_obj_to_skb(): don't copy data for RTR CAN frames in RX-path

In Classical CAN there are RTR frames. RTR frames have the RTR bit set, may
have a dlc != 0, but contain no data.

This patch changes the RX-path to no copy any data for RTR frames, so that the
data field in the CAN frame stays 0x0.
