powerpc/eeh: Add a debugfs interface to check if a driver supports recovery

If a PCI device's current driver implements the error handling callbacks
EEH can use them to recover the device after an error occurs. For devices
without the error handling callbacks we recover them by removing the device
and re-scanning it so the PCI core puts the device back into a known good
state.

Currently there's no way for userspace to determine if the driver supports
recovery or not which makes it difficult to write automated tests for EEH.
This patch addressing that by adding a debugfs interface for querying if
a specific device can be recovered or not.
