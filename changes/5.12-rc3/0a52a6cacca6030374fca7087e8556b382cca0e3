drm/amdgpu: add wave limit functionality for gfx8,9

Wave limiting can be use to load balance high priority
compute jobs along with gfx jobs. When enabled, this will reserve
~75% of waves for compute jobs.

We do not need this from gfx10 onwards because >=gfx10 has
asynchronous compute tunneling to replace wave limit requirement.
