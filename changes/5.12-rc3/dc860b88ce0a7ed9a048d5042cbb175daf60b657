mlxsw: spectrum_router: Ignore routes using a deleted nexthop object

Routes are currently processed from a workqueue whereas nexthop objects
are processed in system call context. This can result in the driver not
finding a suitable nexthop group for a route and issuing a warning [1].

Fix this by ignoring such routes earlier in the process. The subsequent
deletion notification will be ignored as well.
