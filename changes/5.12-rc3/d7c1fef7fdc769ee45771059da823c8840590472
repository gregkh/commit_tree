platform/chrome: Constify static attribute_group structs

The only usage of these is to print their name in a dev_err-message, and
to pass their address to sysfs_create_group() and sysfs_remove_group(),
both which takes pointers to const. Make them const to allow the compiler
to put them in read-only memory.
