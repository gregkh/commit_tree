block: fix potential IO hang when turning off io_poll

QUEUE_FLAG_POLL flag will be cleared when turning off 'io_poll', while
at that moment there may be IOs stuck in hw queue uncompleted. The
following polling routine won't help reap these IOs, since blk_poll()
will return immediately because of cleared QUEUE_FLAG_POLL flag. Thus
these IOs will hang until they finnaly time out. The hang out can be
observed by 'fio --engine=io_uring iodepth=1', while turning off
'io_poll' at the same time.

To fix this, freeze and flush the request queue first when turning off
'io_poll'.
