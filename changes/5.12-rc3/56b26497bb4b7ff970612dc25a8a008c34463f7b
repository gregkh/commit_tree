ALSA: hda/conexant: Add quirk for mute LED control on HP ZBook G5

The mute and mic-mute LEDs on HP ZBook Studio G5 are controlled via
GPIO bits 0x10 and 0x20, respectively, and we need the extra setup for
those.

As the similar code is already present for other HP models but with
different GPIO pins, this patch factors out the common helper code and
applies those GPIO values for each model.
