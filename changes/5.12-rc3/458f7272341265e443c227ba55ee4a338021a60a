xsk: Remove explicit_free parameter from __xsk_rcv()

The explicit_free parameter of the __xsk_rcv() function was used to
mark whether the call was via the generic XDP or the native XDP
path. Instead of clutter the code with if-statements and "true/false"
parameters which are hard to understand, simply move the explicit free
to the __xsk_map_redirect() which is always called from the native XDP
path.
