io-wq: kill hashed waitqueue before manager exits

If we race with shutting down the io-wq context and someone queueing
a hashed entry, then we can exit the manager with it armed. If it then
triggers after the manager has exited, we can have a use-after-free where
io_wqe_hash_wake() attempts to wake a now gone manager process.

Move the killing of the hashed write queue into the manager itself, so
that we know we've killed it before the task exits.
