Makefile: Remove # characters from compiler string

When using AMD's Optimizing C/C++ Compiler (AOCC), the build fails due
to a # character in the version string, which is interpreted as a
comment:

$ make CC=clang defconfig init/main.o
include/config/auto.conf.cmd:1374: *** invalid syntax in conditional. Stop.

$ sed -n 1374p include/config/auto.conf.cmd
ifneq "$(CC_VERSION_TEXT)" "AMD clang version 11.0.0 (CLANG: AOCC_2.3.0-Build#85 2020_11_10) (based on LLVM Mirror.Version.11.0.0)"

Remove all # characters in the version string so that the build does not
fail unexpectedly.
