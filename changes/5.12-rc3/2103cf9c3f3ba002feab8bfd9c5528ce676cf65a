hugetlb: dedup the code to add a new file_region

Patch series "mm/hugetlb: Early cow on fork, and a few cleanups", v5.

As reported by Gal [1], we still miss the code clip to handle early cow
for hugetlb case, which is true.  Again, it still feels odd to fork()
after using a few huge pages, especially if they're privately mapped to
me..  However I do agree with Gal and Jason in that we should still have
that since that'll complete the early cow on fork effort at least, and
it'll still fix issues where buffers are not well under control and not
easy to apply MADV_DONTFORK.

The first two patches (1-2) are some cleanups I noticed when reading into
the hugetlb reserve map code.  I think it's good to have but they're not
necessary for fixing the fork issue.

The last two patches (3-4) are the real fix.

I tested this with a fork() after some vfio-pci assignment, so I'm pretty
sure the page copy path could trigger well (page will be accounted right
after the fork()), but I didn't do data check since the card I assigned is
some random nic.

Introduce hugetlb_resv_map_add() helper to add a new file_region rather
than duplication the similar code twice in add_reservation_in_range().
