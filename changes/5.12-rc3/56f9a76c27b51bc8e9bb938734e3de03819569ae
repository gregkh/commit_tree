serial: stm32: add "_usart" prefix in functions name

Adds the prefix "_usart" in the name of stm32 usart functions in order to
ease the usage of kernel trace and tools, such as f-trace.
Allows to trace "stm32_usart_*" functions with f-trace. Without this patch,
all the driver functions needs to be added manually in f-trace filter.
