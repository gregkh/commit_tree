KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Introduce new capability for 2nd DAWR

Introduce KVM_CAP_PPC_DAWR1 which can be used by QEMU to query whether
KVM supports 2nd DAWR or not. The capability is by default disabled
even when the underlying CPU supports 2nd DAWR. QEMU needs to check
and enable it manually to use the feature.
