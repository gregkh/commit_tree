bpf, devmap: Use GFP_KERNEL for xdp bulk queue allocation

The devmap bulk queue is allocated with GFP_ATOMIC and the allocation
may fail if there is no available space in existing percpu pool.

Since commit 75ccae62cb8d42 ("xdp: Move devmap bulk queue into struct net_device")
moved the bulk queue allocation to NETDEV_REGISTER callback, whose context
is allowed to sleep, use GFP_KERNEL instead of GFP_ATOMIC to let percpu
allocator extend the pool when needed and avoid possible failure of netdev
registration.

As the required alignment is natural, we can simply use alloc_percpu().
