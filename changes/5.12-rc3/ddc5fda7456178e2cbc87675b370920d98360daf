tty: fix up hung_up_tty_read() conversion

In commit "tty: implement read_iter", I left the read_iter conversion of
the hung up tty case alone, because I incorrectly thought it didn't
matter.

Jiri showed me the errors of my ways, and pointed out the problems with
that incomplete conversion.  Fix it all up.
