gfs2: Clean up on-stack transactions

Replace the TR_ALLOCED flag by its inverse, TR_ONSTACK: that way, the flag only
needs to be set in the exceptional case of on-stack transactions.  Split off
__gfs2_trans_begin from gfs2_trans_begin and use it to replace the open-coded
version in gfs2_ail_empty_gl.
