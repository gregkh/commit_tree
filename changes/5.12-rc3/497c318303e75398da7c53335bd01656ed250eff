ARM: dts: cros-ec-keyboard: Use keymap macros

The common cros-ec keymap has been defined as macros. This patch uses
the macros to simply linux,keymap in cros-ec-keyboard.dtsi file.

This patch also creates an alias for keyboard-controller to make it
easier to override the keymap in board-specific dts later.
