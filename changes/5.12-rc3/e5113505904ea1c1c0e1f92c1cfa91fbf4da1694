block: Discard page cache of zone reset target range

When zone reset ioctl and data read race for a same zone on zoned block
devices, the data read leaves stale page cache even though the zone
reset ioctl zero clears all the zone data on the device. To avoid
non-zero data read from the stale page cache after zone reset, discard
page cache of reset target zones in blkdev_zone_mgmt_ioctl(). Introduce
the helper function blkdev_truncate_zone_range() to discard the page
cache. Ensure the page cache discarded by calling the helper function
before and after zone reset in same manner as fallocate does.

This patch can be applied back to the stable kernel version v5.10.y.
Rework is needed for older stable kernels.
