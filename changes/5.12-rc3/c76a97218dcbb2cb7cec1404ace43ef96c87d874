net: enetc: force the RGMII speed and duplex instead of operating in inband mode

The ENETC port 0 MAC supports in-band status signaling coming from a PHY
when operating in RGMII mode, and this feature is enabled by default.

It has been reported that RGMII is broken in fixed-link, and that is not
surprising considering the fact that no PHY is attached to the MAC in
that case, but a switch.

This brings us to the topic of the patch: the enetc driver should have
not enabled the optional in-band status signaling for RGMII unconditionally,
but should have forced the speed and duplex to what was resolved by
phylink.

Note that phylink does not accept the RGMII modes as valid for in-band
signaling, and these operate a bit differently than 1000base-x and SGMII
(notably there is no clause 37 state machine so no ACK required from the
MAC, instead the PHY sends extra code words on RXD[3:0] whenever it is
not transmitting something else, so it should be safe to leave a PHY
with this option unconditionally enabled even if we ignore it). The spec
talks about this here:
