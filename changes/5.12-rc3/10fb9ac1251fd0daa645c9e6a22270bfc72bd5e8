xfs: rename xfs_wait_buftarg() to xfs_buftarg_drain()

xfs_wait_buftarg() is vaguely named and somewhat overloaded. Its
primary purpose is to reclaim all buffers from the provided buffer
target LRU. In preparation to refactor xfs_wait_buftarg() into
serialization and LRU draining components, rename the function and
associated helpers to something more descriptive. This patch has no
functional changes with the minor exception of renaming a
tracepoint.
