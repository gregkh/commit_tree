drm/vc4: hdmi: Fix register offset with longer CEC messages

The code prior to 311e305fdb4e ("drm/vc4: hdmi: Implement a register
layout abstraction") was relying on the fact that the register offset
was incremented by 4 for each readl call. That worked since the register
width is 4 bytes.

However, since that commit the HDMI_READ macro is now taking an enum,
and the offset doesn't increment by 4 but 1 now. Divide the index by 4
to fix this.
