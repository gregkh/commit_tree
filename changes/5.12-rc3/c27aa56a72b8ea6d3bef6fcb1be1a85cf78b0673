cfg80211: add VHT rate entries for MCS-10 and MCS-11

Observed the warning in cfg80211_calculate_bitrate_vht() using an
11ac chip reporting MCS-11. Since devices reporting non-standard
MCS-9 is already supported add similar entries for MCS-10 and MCS-11.
Actually, the value of MCS-9@20MHz is slightly off so corrected that.
