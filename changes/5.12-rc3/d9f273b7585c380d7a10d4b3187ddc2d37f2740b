nvmet: model_number must be immutable once set

In case we have already established connection to nvmf target, it
shouldn't be allowed to change the model_number. E.g. if someone will
identify ctrl and get model_number of "my_model" later on will change
the model_numbel via configfs to "my_new_model" this will break the NVMe
specification for "Get Log Page â€“ Persistent Event Log" that refers to
Model Number as: "This field contains the same value as reported in the
Model Number field of the Identify Controller data structure, bytes
63:24."

Although it doesn't mentioned explicitly that this field can't be
changed, we can assume it.

So allow setting this field only once: using configfs or in the first
identify ctrl operation.
