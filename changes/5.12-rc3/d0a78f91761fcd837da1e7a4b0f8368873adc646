vfio/iommu_type1: Populate full dirty when detach non-pinned group

If a group with non-pinned-page dirty scope is detached with dirty
logging enabled, we should fully populate the dirty bitmaps at the
time it's removed since we don't know the extent of its previous DMA,
nor will the group be present to trigger the full bitmap when the user
retrieves the dirty bitmap.
