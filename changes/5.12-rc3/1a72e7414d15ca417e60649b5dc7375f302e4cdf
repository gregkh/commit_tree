drm/i915/gem: Reduce ctx->engine_mutex for reading the clone source

When cloning the engines from the source context, we need to ensure that
the engines are not freed as we copy them, and that the flags we clone
from the source correspond with the engines we copy across. To do this
we need only take a reference to the src->engines, rather than hold the
src->engine_mutex, so long as we verify that nothing changed under the
read.
