io-wq: have manager wait for all workers to exit

Instead of having to wait separately on workers and manager, just have
the manager wait on the workers. We use an atomic_t for the reference
here, as we need to start at 0 and allow increment from that. Since the
number of workers is naturally capped by the allowed nr of processes,
and that uses an int, there is no risk of overflow.
