powerpc/8xx: Fix software emulation interrupt

For unimplemented instructions or unimplemented SPRs, the 8xx triggers
a "Software Emulation Exception" (0x1000). That interrupt doesn't set
reason bits in SRR1 as the "Program Check Exception" does.

Go through emulation_assist_interrupt() to set REASON_ILLEGAL.
