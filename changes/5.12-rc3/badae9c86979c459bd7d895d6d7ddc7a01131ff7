btrfs: zoned: do not account freed region of read-only block group as zone_unusable

We migrate zone unusable bytes to read-only bytes when a block group is
set to read-only, and account all the free region as bytes_readonly.
Thus, we should not increase block_group->zone_unusable when the block
group is read-only.
