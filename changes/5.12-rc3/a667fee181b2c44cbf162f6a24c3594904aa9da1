s390/qeth: make cast type selection for af_iucv skbs robust

As part of the TX queue selection for af_iucv skbs,
qeth_l3_get_cast_type_rcu() ends up calling qeth_get_ether_cast_type().
Which is rather fragile, since such skbs don't have a proper ETH header
and we rely on it being zeroed out in the right places. Add a separate
case for ETH_P_AF_IUCV instead that does the right thing.

When later building the HW header for such skbs, don't hard-code the
cast type but follow the same path as for other protocol types. Here
the cast type should naturally come from the skb's queue mapping.
