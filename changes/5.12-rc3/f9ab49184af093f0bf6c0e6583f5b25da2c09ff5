blk-mq: Use llist_head for blk_cpu_done

With llist_head it is possible to avoid the locking (the irq-off region)
when items are added. This makes it possible to add items on a remote
CPU without additional locking.
llist_add() returns true if the list was previously empty. This can be
used to invoke the SMP function call / raise sofirq only if the first
item was added (otherwise it is already pending).
This simplifies the code a little and reduces the IRQ-off regions.

blk_mq_raise_softirq() needs a preempt-disable section to ensure the
request is enqueued on the same CPU as the softirq is raised.
Some callers (USB-storage) invoke this path in preemptible context.
