usb: phy: tegra: Add delay after power up

The PHY hardware needs the delay of 2ms after power up, otherwise initial
interrupt may be lost if USB controller is accessed before PHY is settled
down. Previously this issue was masked by implicit delays, but now it pops
up after squashing the older ehci-tegra driver into the ChipIdea driver.
