nvme-fc: fix racing controller reset and create association

Recent patch to prevent calling __nvme_fc_abort_outstanding_ios in
interrupt context results in a possible race condition. A controller
reset results in errored io completions, which schedules error
work. The change of error work to a work element allows it to fire
after the ctrl state transition to NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING, causing
any outstanding io (used to initialize the controller) to fail and
cause problems for connect_work.

Add a state check to only schedule error work if not in the RESETTING
state.
