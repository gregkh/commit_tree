ibmvnic: Fix possibly uninitialized old_num_tx_queues variable warning.

GCC 7.5 reports:
../drivers/net/ethernet/ibm/ibmvnic.c: In function 'ibmvnic_reset_init':
../drivers/net/ethernet/ibm/ibmvnic.c:5373:51: warning: 'old_num_tx_queues' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
../drivers/net/ethernet/ibm/ibmvnic.c:5373:6: warning: 'old_num_rx_queues' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

The variable is initialized only if(reset) and used only if(reset &&
something) so this is a false positive. However, there is no reason to
not initialize the variables unconditionally avoiding the warning.

Fixes: 635e442f4a48 ("ibmvnic: merge ibmvnic_reset_init and ibmvnic_init")
