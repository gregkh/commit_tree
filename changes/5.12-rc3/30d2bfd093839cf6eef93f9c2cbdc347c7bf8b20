drm/i915/gem: Almagamate clflushes on freeze

When flushing objects larger than the CPU cache it is preferrable to use
a single wbinvd() rather than overlapping clflush(). At runtime, we
avoid wbinvd() due to its system-wide latencies, but during
singlethreaded suspend, no one will observe the imposed latency and we
can opt for the faster wbinvd to clear all objects in a single hit.
