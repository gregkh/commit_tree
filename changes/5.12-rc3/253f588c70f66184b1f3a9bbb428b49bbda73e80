xhci: Improve detection of device initiated wake signal.

A xHC USB 3 port might miss the first wake signal from a USB 3 device
if the port LFPS reveiver isn't enabled fast enough after xHC resume.

xHC host will anyway be resumed by a PME# signal, but will go back to
suspend if no port activity is seen.
The device resends the U3 LFPS wake signal after a 100ms delay, but
by then host is already suspended, starting all over from the
beginning of this issue.

USB 3 specs say U3 wake LFPS signal is sent for max 10ms, then device
needs to delay 100ms before resending the wake.

Don't suspend immediately if port activity isn't detected in resume.
Instead add a retry. If there is no port activity then delay for 120ms,
and re-check for port activity.
