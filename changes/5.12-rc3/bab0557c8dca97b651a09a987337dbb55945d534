drm/i915/gt: Remove virtual breadcrumb before transfer

The issue with stale virtual breadcrumbs remain. Now we have the problem
that if the irq-signaler is still referencing the stale breadcrumb as we
transfer it to a new sibling, the list becomes spaghetti. This is a very
small window, but that doesn't stop it being hit infrequently. To
prevent the lists being tangled (the iterator starting on one engine's
b->signalers but walking onto another list), always decouple the virtual
breadcrumb on schedule-out and make sure that the walker has stepped out
of the lists.
