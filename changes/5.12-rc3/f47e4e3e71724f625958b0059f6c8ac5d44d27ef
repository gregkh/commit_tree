RDMA/rtrs-clt: Set mininum limit when create QP

Currently rtrs when create_qp use a coarse numbers (bigger in general),
which leads to hardware create more resources which only waste memory
with no benefits.

- SERVICE con,
For max_send_wr/max_recv_wr, it's 2 times SERVICE_CON_QUEUE_DEPTH + 2

- IO con
For max_send_wr/max_recv_wr, it's sess->queue_depth * 3 + 1
