ring-buffer: Add a little more information and a WARN when time stamp going backwards is detected

When the CONFIG_RING_BUFFER_VALIDATE_TIME_DELTAS is enabled, and the time
stamps are detected as not being valid, it reports information about the
write stamp, but does not show the before_stamp which is still useful
information. Also, it should give a warning once, such that tests detect
this happening.
