sched: Fix migration_cpu_stop() WARN

Oleksandr reported hitting the WARN in the 'task_rq(p) != rq' branch
of migration_cpu_stop(). Valentin noted that using cpu_of(rq) in that
case is just plain wrong to begin with, since per the earlier branch
that isn't the actual CPU of the task.

Replace both instances of is_cpu_allowed() by a direct p->cpus_mask
test using task_cpu().
