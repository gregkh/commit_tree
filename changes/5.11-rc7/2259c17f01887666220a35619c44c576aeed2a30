kvm: x86: Sink cpuid update into vendor-specific set_cr4 functions

On emulated VM-entry and VM-exit, update the CPUID bits that reflect
CR4.OSXSAVE and CR4.PKE.

This fixes a bug where the CPUID bits could continue to reflect L2 CR4
values after emulated VM-exit to L1. It also fixes a related bug where
the CPUID bits could continue to reflect L1 CR4 values after emulated
VM-entry to L2. The latter bug is mainly relevant to SVM, wherein
CPUID is not a required intercept. However, it could also be relevant
to VMX, because the code to conditionally update these CPUID bits
assumes that the guest CPUID and the guest CR4 are always in sync.

Fixes: 8eb3f87d903168 ("KVM: nVMX: fix guest CR4 loading when emulating L2 to L1 exit")
Fixes: 2acf923e38fb6a ("KVM: VMX: Enable XSAVE/XRSTOR for guest")
Fixes: b9baba86148904 ("KVM, pkeys: expose CPUID/CR4 to guest")
