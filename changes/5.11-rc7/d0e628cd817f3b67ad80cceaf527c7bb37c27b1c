kbuild: doc: clarify the difference between extra-y and always-y

The difference between extra-y and always-y is obscure.

Basically, Kbuild builds targets listed in extra-y and always-y in
visited Makefiles without relying on any dependency.

The difference is that extra-y is used to list the targets needed for
vmlinux whereas always-y is used to list the targets that must be always
built irrespective of final targets.

Kbuild skips extra-y when it is building only modules (i.e.
'make modules'). This is the long-standing behavior since extra-y was
introduced in 2003, and it is explained in that commit log [1].

For clarification, this is the extra-y vs always-y table:

                  extra-y    always-y
  'make'             y          y
  'make vmlinux'     y          y
  'make modules'     n          y

Kbuild skips extra-y also when building external modules since obviously
it never builds vmlinux.

Unfortunately, extra-y is wrongly used in many places of upstream code,
and even in external modules.

Using extra-y in external module Makefiles is wrong. What you should
use is probably always-y or 'targets'.

The current documentation for extra-y is misleading. I rewrote it, and
moved it to the section 3.7.

always-y is not documented anywhere. I added.
