habanalabs/gaudi: increase MAX CS to 16K

We need to have the MAX CS be much larger than the size of the
different queues. In GAUDI we have around 8 groups of queues, and each
group has 1K queue size. To prevent head-of-the-line blocking, we need
to make sure there is sufficient number of available CS allocations
even if one or more of those queues are full.
