iio: adc: ad7298: check regulator for null in ad7298_get_ref_voltage()

'st->ext_ref' & 'st->reg' are both non-zero/non-null at the same time, so
logically the code isn't broken.
But it is more correct to check that 'st->reg' is non-null, since we make
sure that the regulator is NULL (in probe) in case one isn't defined.
