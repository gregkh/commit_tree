ASoC: Intel: Boards: tgl_max98373: update TDM slot_width

Speaker amp's SSP bclk configuration was changed in the topology file to be
based on 12.288MHz and dai_ops->hw_params is based on s32le format.
But, the TDM slot size remained set to 24 bits.
This inconsistency created audible noises and needs to be corrected.
This patch updates TDM slot width to 32.
