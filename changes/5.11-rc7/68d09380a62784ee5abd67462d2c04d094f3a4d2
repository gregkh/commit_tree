HID: elecom: rewrite report based on model specific parameters

The report descriptor for EX-G wireless mouse (M-XGL20DLBK) is a bit
different from that for trackball mice such as DEFT. For such mouse, the
current `mouse_button_fixup` cannot be used as is, because it uses
hard-coded indices for a report descriptor.

Add parameters to `mouse_button_fixup` function, in order to support
fixing report descriptors for more models.
