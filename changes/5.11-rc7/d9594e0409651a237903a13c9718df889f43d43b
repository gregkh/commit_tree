tomoyo: fix clang pointer arithmetic warning

clang warns about additions on NULL pointers being undefined in C:

security/tomoyo/securityfs_if.c:226:59: warning: arithmetic on a null pointer treated as a cast from integer to pointer is a GNU extension [-Wnull-pointer-arithmetic]
        securityfs_create_file(name, mode, parent, ((u8 *) NULL) + key,

Change the code to instead use a cast through uintptr_t to avoid
the warning.
