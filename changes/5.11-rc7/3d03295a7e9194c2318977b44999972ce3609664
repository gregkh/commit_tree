relay: remove unused buf_mapped and buf_unmapped callbacks

Patch series "relay: cleanup and const callbacks", v2.

None of the relay users require the use of mutable structs for callbacks,
however the relay code does.  Instead of assigning default callbacks when
there is none, add callback wrappers to conditionally call the client
callbacks if available, and fall back to default behaviour (typically
no-op) otherwise.

This lets all relay users make their struct rchan_callbacks const data.

This series starts with a number of cleanups first based on Christoph's
feedback.

This patch (of 9):

No relay client uses the buf_mapped or buf_unmapped callbacks.  Remove
them.  This makes relay's vm_operations_struct close callback a dummy,
remove it as well.
