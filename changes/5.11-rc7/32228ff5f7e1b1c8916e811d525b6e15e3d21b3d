drm/fb-helper: Acquire modeset lock around shadow-buffer flushing

Flushing the fbdev's shadow buffer requires vmap'ing the BO memory, which
in turn requires pinning the BO. While being pinned, the BO cannot be moved
into VRAM for scanout. Consequently, a concurrent modeset operation that
involves the fbdev framebuffer would likely fail.

Resolve this problem be acquiring the modeset lock of the planes that use
the fbdev framebuffer. On non-atomic drivers, also acquire the mode-config
lock. This serializes the flushing of the framebuffer with concurrent
modeset operations.

v2:
	* only acquire struct drm_fb_helper.lock in damage blitter (Daniel,
	  Christian)
