usb: dwc3: fix clock issue during resume in OTG mode

Commit fe8abf332b8f ("usb: dwc3: support clocks and resets for DWC3
core") introduced clock support and a new function named
dwc3_core_init_for_resume() which enables the clock before calling
dwc3_core_init() during resume as clocks get disabled during suspend.

Unfortunately in this commit the DWC3_GCTL_PRTCAP_OTG case was forgotten
and therefore during resume, a platform could call dwc3_core_init()
without re-enabling the clocks first, preventing to resume properly.

So update the resume path to call dwc3_core_init_for_resume() as it
should.
