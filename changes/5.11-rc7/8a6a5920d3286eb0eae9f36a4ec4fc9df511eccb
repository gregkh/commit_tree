sched/vtime: Consolidate IRQ time accounting

The 3 architectures implementing CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE
all have their own version of irq time accounting that dispatch the
cputime to the appropriate index: hardirq, softirq, system, idle,
guest... from an all-in-one function.

Instead of having these ad-hoc versions, move the cputime destination
dispatch decision to the core code and leave only the actual per-index
cputime accounting to the architecture.
