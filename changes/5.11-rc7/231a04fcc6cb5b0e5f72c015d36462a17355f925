drm/msm/dp: deinitialize mainlink if link training failed

DP compo phy have to be enable to start link training. When
link training failed phy need to be disabled so that next
link traning can be proceed smoothly at next plug in. This
patch de-initialize mainlink to disable phy if link training
failed. This prevent system crash due to
disp_cc_mdss_dp_link_intf_clk stuck at "off" state.  This patch
also perform checking power_on flag at dp_display_enable() and
dp_display_disable() to avoid crashing when unplug cable while
display is off.
