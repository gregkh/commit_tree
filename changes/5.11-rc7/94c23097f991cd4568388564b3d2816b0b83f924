can: gw: support modification of Classical CAN DLCs

Add support for data length code modifications for Classical CAN.

The netlink configuration interface always allowed to pass any value
that fits into a byte, therefore only the modification process had to be
extended to handle the raw DLC represenation of Classical CAN frames.

When a DLC value from 0 .. F is provided for Classical CAN frame
modifications the 'len' value is modified as-is with the exception that
potentially existing 9 .. F DLC values in the len8_dlc element are moved
to the 'len' element for the modification operation by mod_retrieve_ccdlc().

After the modification the Classical CAN frame DLC information is brought
back into the correct format by mod_store_ccdlc() which is filling 'len'
and 'len8_dlc' accordingly.
