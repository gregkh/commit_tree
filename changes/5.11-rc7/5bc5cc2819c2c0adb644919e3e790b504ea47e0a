drm/panfrost: Move the GPU reset bits outside the timeout handler

We've fixed many races in panfrost_job_timedout() but some remain.
Instead of trying to fix it again, let's simplify the logic and move
the reset bits to a separate work scheduled when one of the queue
reports a timeout.

v5:
- Simplify panfrost_scheduler_stop() (Steven Price)
- Always restart the queue in panfrost_scheduler_start() even if
  the status is corrupted (Steven Price)

v4:
- Rework the logic to prevent a race between drm_sched_start()
  (reset work) and drm_sched_job_timedout() (timeout work)
- Drop Steven's R-b
- Add dma_fence annotation to the panfrost_reset() function (Daniel Vetter)

v3:
- Replace the atomic_cmpxchg() by an atomic_xchg() (Robin Murphy)
- Add Steven's R-b

v2:
- Use atomic_cmpxchg() to conditionally schedule the reset work
  (Steven Price)
