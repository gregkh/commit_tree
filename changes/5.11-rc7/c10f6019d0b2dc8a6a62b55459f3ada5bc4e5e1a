drm/i915/gt: Use the local HWSP offset during submission

We wrap the timeline on construction of the next request, but there may
still be requests in flight that have not yet finalized the breadcrumb.
(The breadcrumb is delayed as we need engine-local offsets, and for the
virtual engine that is not known until execution.) As such, by the time
we write to the timeline's HWSP offset it may have changed, and we
should use the value we preserved in the request instead.

Though the window is small and infrequent (at full flow we can expect a
timeline's seqno to wrap once every 30 minutes), the impact of writing
the old seqno into the new HWSP is severe: the old requests are never
completed, and the new requests are completed before they are even
submitted.
