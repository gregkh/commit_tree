Revert "um: allocate a guard page to helper threads"

This reverts commit ef4459a6da09 ("um: allocate a guard page to
helper threads"), it's broken in multiple ways:

 1) the free no longer matches the alloc; and

 2) more importantly, the set_memory_ro() causes allocation of
    page tables for the normal memory that doesn't have any,
    and that later causes corruption and crashes (usually but
    not always in vfree()).

We could fix the first bug and use vmalloc() to work around the
second, but set_memory_ro() actually doesn't do anything either
so I'll just revert that as well.
