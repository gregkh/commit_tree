audit: trigger accompanying records when no rules present

When there are no audit rules registered, mandatory records (config,
etc.) are missing their accompanying records (syscall, proctitle, etc.).

This is due to audit context dummy set on syscall entry based on absence
of rules that signals that no other records are to be printed.  Clear the dummy
bit if any record is generated, open coding this in audit_log_start().

The proctitle context and dummy checks are pointless since the
proctitle record will not be printed if no syscall records are printed.

The fds array is reset to -1 after the first syscall to indicate it
isn't valid any more, but was never set to -1 when the context was
allocated to indicate it wasn't yet valid.

Check ctx->pwd in audit_log_name().

The audit_inode* functions can be called without going through
getname_flags() or getname_kernel() that sets audit_names and cwd, so
set the cwd in audit_alloc_name() if it has not already been done so due to
audit_names being valid and purge all other audit_getcwd() calls.

Revert the LSM dump_common_audit_data() LSM_AUDIT_DATA_* cases from the
ghak96 patch since they are no longer necessary due to cwd coverage in
audit_alloc_name().

Thanks to bauen1 <j2468h@googlemail.com> for reporting LSM situations in
which context->cwd is not valid, inadvertantly fixed by the ghak96 patch.
