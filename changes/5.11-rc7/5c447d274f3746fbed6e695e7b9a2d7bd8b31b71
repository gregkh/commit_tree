mm: fix numa stats for thp migration

Currently the kernel is not correctly updating the numa stats for
NR_FILE_PAGES and NR_SHMEM on THP migration.  Fix that.

For NR_FILE_DIRTY and NR_ZONE_WRITE_PENDING, although at the moment
there is no need to handle THP migration as kernel still does not have
write support for file THP but to be more future proof, this patch adds
the THP support for those stats as well.
