KVM: arm64: Add .hyp.data..ro_after_init ELF section

Add rules for renaming the .data..ro_after_init ELF section in KVM nVHE
object files to .hyp.data..ro_after_init, linking it into the kernel
and mapping it in hyp at runtime.

The section is RW to the host, then mapped RO in hyp. The expectation is
that the host populates the variables in the section and they are never
changed by hyp afterwards.
