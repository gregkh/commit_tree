opp: Always add entries in dev_list with opp_table->lock held

The readers of dev_list expect the updates to it to take place from
within the opp_table->lock and this is missing in the case where the
dev_list is updated for already managed OPPs.

Fix that by calling _add_opp_dev() from there and remove the now unused
_add_opp_dev_unlocked() callback. While at it, also reduce the length of
the critical section in _add_opp_dev().
