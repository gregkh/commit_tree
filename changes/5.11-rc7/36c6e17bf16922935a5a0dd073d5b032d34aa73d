sched/core: Print out straggler tasks in sched_cpu_dying()

Since commit

  1cf12e08bc4d ("sched/hotplug: Consolidate task migration on CPU unplug")

tasks are expected to move themselves out of a out-going CPU. For most
tasks this will be done automagically via BALANCE_PUSH, but percpu kthreads
will have to cooperate and move themselves away one way or another.

Currently, some percpu kthreads (workqueues being a notable exemple) do not
cooperate nicely and can end up on an out-going CPU at the time
sched_cpu_dying() is invoked.

Print the dying rq's tasks to shed some light on the stragglers.
