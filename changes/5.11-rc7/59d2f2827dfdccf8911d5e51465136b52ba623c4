ARM: head: use PC-relative insn sequence for __smp_alt

Now that calling __do_fixup_smp_on_up() can be done without passing
the physical-to-virtual offset in r3, we can replace the open coded
PC relative offset calculations with a pair of adr_l invocations. This
removes some open coded arithmetic involving virtual addresses, avoids
literal pools on v7+, and slightly reduces the footprint of the code.
