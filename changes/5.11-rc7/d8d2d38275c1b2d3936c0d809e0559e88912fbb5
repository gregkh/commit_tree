kbuild: remove PYTHON variable

Python retired in 2020, and some distributions do not provide the
'python' command any more.

As in commit 51839e29cb59 ("scripts: switch explicitly to Python 3"),
we need to use more specific 'python3' to invoke scripts even if they
are written in a way compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

This commit removes the variable 'PYTHON', and switches the existing
users to 'PYTHON3'.

BTW, PEP 394 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/) is a helpful
material.
