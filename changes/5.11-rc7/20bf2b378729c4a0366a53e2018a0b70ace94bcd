x86/build: Disable CET instrumentation in the kernel

With retpolines disabled, some configurations of GCC, and specifically
the GCC versions 9 and 10 in Ubuntu will add Intel CET instrumentation
to the kernel by default. That breaks certain tracing scenarios by
adding a superfluous ENDBR64 instruction before the fentry call, for
functions which can be called indirectly.

CET instrumentation isn't currently necessary in the kernel, as CET is
only supported in user space. Disable it unconditionally and move it
into the x86's Makefile as CET/CFI... enablement should be a per-arch
decision anyway.
