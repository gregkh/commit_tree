drm/nouveau/dispnv50: Restore pushing of all data.

Commit f844eb485eb056ad3b67e49f95cbc6c685a73db4 introduced a regression for
NV50, which lead to visual artifacts, tearing and eventual crashes.

In the changes of f844eb485eb056ad3b67e49f95cbc6c685a73db4 only the first line
was correctly translated to the new NVIDIA header macros:

-		PUSH_NVSQ(push, NV827C, 0x0110, 0,
-					0x0114, 0);
+		PUSH_MTHD(push, NV827C, SET_PROCESSING,
+			  NVDEF(NV827C, SET_PROCESSING, USE_GAIN_OFS, DISABLE));

The lower part ("0x0114, 0") was probably omitted by accident.

This patch restores the push of the missing data and fixes the regression.
