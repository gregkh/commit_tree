nl80211/cfg80211: fix potential infinite loop

The for-loop iterates with a u8 loop counter and compares this
with the loop upper limit of request->n_ssids which is an int type.
There is a potential infinite loop if n_ssids is larger than the
u8 loop counter, so fix this by making the loop counter an int.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Infinite loop")
