ubifs: prevent creating duplicate encrypted filenames

As described in "fscrypt: add fscrypt_is_nokey_name()", it's possible to
create a duplicate filename in an encrypted directory by creating a file
concurrently with adding the directory's encryption key.

Fix this bug on ubifs by rejecting no-key dentries in ubifs_create(),
ubifs_mkdir(), ubifs_mknod(), and ubifs_symlink().

Note that ubifs doesn't actually report the duplicate filenames from
readdir, but rather it seems to replace the original dentry with a new
one (which is still wrong, just a different effect from ext4).

On ubifs, this fixes xfstest generic/595 as well as the new xfstest I
wrote specifically for this bug.
