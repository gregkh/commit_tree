RDMA/mlx5: Fix corruption of reg_pages in mlx5_ib_rereg_user_mr()

reg_pages should always contain mr->npage since when the mr is finally
de-reg'd it is always subtracted out.

If there were any error exits then mlx5_ib_rereg_user_mr() would leave the
reg_pages adjusted and this will cause it to be double subtracted
eventually.

The manipulation of reg_pages is inherently connected to the umem, so lift
it out of set_mr_fields() and only adjust it around creating/destroying a
umem.

reg_pages is only used for diagnostics in sysfs.
