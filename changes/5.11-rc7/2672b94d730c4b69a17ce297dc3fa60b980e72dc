MAINTAINERS: Update my email address and maintainer level status

My employment with TI is ending tomorrow, so update the email address
entry in the maintainers file. Also, I don't expect to spend that much
time with maintaining TI code anymore, so downgrade the status level to
odd fixes only on areas where I remain as the main contact point for
now, and move myself as secondary contact point where someone else has
taken over the maintainership.
