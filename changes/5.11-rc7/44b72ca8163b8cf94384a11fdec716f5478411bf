mac80211: Update rate control on channel change

A channel change or a channel bandwidth change can impact the
rate control logic. However, the rate control logic was not updated
before/after such a change, which might result in unexpected
behavior.

Fix this by updating the stations rate control logic when the
corresponding channel context changes.
