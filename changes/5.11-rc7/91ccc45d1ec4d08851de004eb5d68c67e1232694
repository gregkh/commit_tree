arm64: defconfig: Enable QCOM_SCM as builtin

The Qualcomm SCM driver was never explicitly enabled in the defconfig.
Instead it was (apparently) selected by DRM_MSM and by the recent change
to make it tristate now became =m.

Unfortunately this removes the ability for PINCTRL_MSM and ARM_SMMU to
be =y and with deferred_probe_timeout defaulting to 0 this means that
things such as UART, USB, PCIe and SDHCI probes with their dependencies
ignored.

The lack of pinctrl results in invalid pin configuration and the lack of
iommu results in the system locking up as soon as any form of data
transfer is attempted from any of the affected peripherals.

Mark QCOM_SCM as builtin, to avoid this.
