Bluetooth: Change MGMT security info CMD to be more generic

For advertising, we wish to know the LE tx power capabilities of the
controller in userspace, so this patch edits the Security Info MGMT
command to be more generic, such that other various controller
capabilities can be included in the EIR data. This change also includes
the LE min and max tx power into this newly-named command.

The change was tested by manually verifying that the MGMT command
returns the tx power range as expected in userspace.
