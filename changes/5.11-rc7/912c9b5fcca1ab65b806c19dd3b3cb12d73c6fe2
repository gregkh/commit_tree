net/mlx5e: Revert parameters on errors when changing trust state without reset

Trust state may be changed without recreating the channels. It happens
when the channels are closed, and when channel parameters (min inline
mode) stay the same after changing the trust state. Changing the trust
state is a hardware command that may fail. The current code didn't
restore the channel parameters to their old values if an error happened
and the channels were closed. This commit adds handling for this case.
