powerpc/book3s64/kuap/kuep: Add PPC_PKEY config on book3s64

The config CONFIG_PPC_PKEY is used to select the base support that is
required for PPC_MEM_KEYS, KUAP, and KUEP. Adding this dependency
reduces the code complexity(in terms of #ifdefs) and enables us to
move some of the initialization code to pkeys.c
