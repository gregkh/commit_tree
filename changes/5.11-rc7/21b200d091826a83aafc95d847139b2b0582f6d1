cifs: report error instead of invalid when revalidating a dentry fails

Assuming
- //HOST/a is mounted on /mnt
- //HOST/b is mounted on /mnt/b

On a slow connection, running 'df' and killing it while it's
processing /mnt/b can make cifs_get_inode_info() returns -ERESTARTSYS.

This triggers the following chain of events:
=> the dentry revalidation fail
=> dentry is put and released
=> superblock associated with the dentry is put
=> /mnt/b is unmounted

This patch makes cifs_d_revalidate() return the error instead of 0
(invalid) when cifs_revalidate_dentry() fails, except for ENOENT (file
deleted) and ESTALE (file recreated).
