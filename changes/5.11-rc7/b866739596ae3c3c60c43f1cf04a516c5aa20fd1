fuse: set FUSE_WRITE_KILL_SUIDGID in cached write path

With HANDLE_KILLPRIV_V2, server will need to kill suid/sgid if caller does
not have CAP_FSETID.  We already have a flag FUSE_WRITE_KILL_SUIDGID in
WRITE request and we already set it in direct I/O path.

To make it work in cached write path also, start setting
FUSE_WRITE_KILL_SUIDGID in this path too.

Set it only if fc->handle_killpriv_v2 is set.  Otherwise client is
responsible for kill suid/sgid.

In case of direct I/O we set FUSE_WRITE_KILL_SUIDGID unconditionally
because we don't call file_remove_privs() in that path (with cache=none
option).
