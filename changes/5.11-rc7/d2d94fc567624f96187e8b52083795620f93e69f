clk: s2mps11: Fix a resource leak in error handling paths in the probe function

Some resource should be released in the error handling path of the probe
function, as already done in the remove function.

The remove function was fixed in commit bf416bd45738 ("clk: s2mps11: Add
missing of_node_put and of_clk_del_provider")

Fixes: 7cc560dea415 ("clk: s2mps11: Add support for s2mps11")
