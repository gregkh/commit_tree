tty: implement write_iter

This makes the tty layer use the .write_iter() function instead of the
traditional .write() functionality.

That allows writev(), but more importantly also makes it possible to
enable .splice_write() for ttys, reinstating the "splice to tty"
functionality that was lost in commit 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow
splice read/write without explicit ops").
