file: Rename __close_fd to close_fd and remove the files parameter

The function __close_fd was added to support binder[1].  Now that
binder has been fixed to no longer need __close_fd[2] all calls
to __close_fd pass current->files.

Therefore transform the files parameter into a local variable
initialized to current->files, and rename __close_fd to close_fd to
reflect this change, and keep it in sync with the similar changes to
__alloc_fd, and __fd_install.

This removes the need for callers to care about the extra care that
needs to be take if anything except current->files is passed, by
limiting the callers to only operation on current->files.
