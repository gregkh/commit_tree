Revert "mm: fix initialization of struct page for holes in memory layout"

This reverts commit d3921cb8be29ce5668c64e23ffdaeec5f8c69399.

Chris Wilson reports that it causes boot problems:

 "We have half a dozen or so different machines in CI that are silently
  failing to boot, that we believe is bisected to this patch"

and the CI team confirmed that a revert fixed the issues.

The cause is unknown for now, so let's revert it.
