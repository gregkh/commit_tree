mmc: core: Initial support for SD express card/host

In the SD specification v7.10 the SD express card has been added. This new
type of removable SD card, can be managed via a PCIe/NVMe based interface,
while also allowing backwards compatibility towards the legacy SD
interface.

To keep the backwards compatibility, it's required to start the
initialization through the legacy SD interface. If it turns out that the
mmc host and the SD card, both supports the PCIe/NVMe interface, then a
switch should be allowed.

Therefore, let's introduce some basic support for this type of SD cards to
the mmc core. The mmc host, should set MMC_CAP2_SD_EXP if it supports this
interface and MMC_CAP2_SD_EXP_1_2V, if also 1.2V is supported, as to inform
the core about it.

To deal with the switch to the PCIe/NVMe interface, the mmc host is
required to implement a new host ops, ->init_sd_express(). Based on the
initial communication between the host and the card, host->ios.timing is
set to either MMC_TIMING_SD_EXP or MMC_TIMING_SD_EXP_1_2V, depending on if
1.2V is supported or not. In this way, the mmc host can check these values
in its ->init_sd_express() ops, to know how to proceed with the handover.

Note that, to manage card insert/removal, the mmc core sticks with using
the ->get_cd() callback, which means it's the host's responsibility to make
sure it provides valid data, even if the card may be managed by PCIe/NVMe
at the moment. As long as the card seems to be present, the mmc core keeps
the card powered on.
