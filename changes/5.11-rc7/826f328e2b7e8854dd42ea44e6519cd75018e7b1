net: dcb: Validate netlink message in DCB handler

DCB uses the same handler function for both RTM_GETDCB and RTM_SETDCB
messages. dcb_doit() bounces RTM_SETDCB mesasges if the user does not have
the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.

However, the operation to be performed is not decided from the DCB message
type, but from the DCB command. Thus DCB_CMD_*_GET commands are used for
reading DCB objects, the corresponding SET and DEL commands are used for
manipulation.

The assumption is that set-like commands will be sent via an RTM_SETDCB
message, and get-like ones via RTM_GETDCB. However, this assumption is not
enforced.

It is therefore possible to manipulate DCB objects without CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability by sending the corresponding command in an RTM_GETDCB message.
That is a bug. Fix it by validating the type of the request message against
the type used for the response.
