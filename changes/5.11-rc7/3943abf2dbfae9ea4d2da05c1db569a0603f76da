x86/debug: Prevent data breakpoints on cpu_dr7

local_db_save() is called at the start of exc_debug_kernel(), reads DR7 and
disables breakpoints to prevent recursion.

When running in a guest (X86_FEATURE_HYPERVISOR), local_db_save() reads the
per-cpu variable cpu_dr7 to check whether a breakpoint is active or not
before it accesses DR7.

A data breakpoint on cpu_dr7 therefore results in infinite #DB recursion.

Disallow data breakpoints on cpu_dr7 to prevent that.
