thermal/core: Add critical and hot ops

Currently there is no way to the sensors to directly call an ops in
interrupt mode without calling thermal_zone_device_update assuming all
the trip points are defined.

A sensor may want to do something special if a trip point is hot or
critical.

This patch adds the critical and hot ops to the thermal zone device,
so a sensor can directly invoke them or let the thermal framework to
call the sensor specific ones.
