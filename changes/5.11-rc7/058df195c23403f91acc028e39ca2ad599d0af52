x86/ioapic: Cleanup the timer_works() irqflags mess

Mark tripped over the creative irqflags handling in the IO-APIC timer
delivery check which ends up doing:

        local_irq_save(flags);
	local_irq_enable();
        local_irq_restore(flags);

which triggered a new consistency check he's working on required for
replacing the POPF based restore with a conditional STI.

That code is a historical mess and none of this is needed. Make it
straightforward use local_irq_disable()/enable() as that's all what is
required. It is invoked from interrupt enabled code nowadays.
