iwlwifi: pcie: set LTR on more devices

To avoid completion timeouts during device boot, set up the
LTR timeouts on more devices - similar to what we had before
for AX210.

This also corrects the AX210 workaround to be done only on
discrete (non-integrated) devices, otherwise the registers
have no effect.
