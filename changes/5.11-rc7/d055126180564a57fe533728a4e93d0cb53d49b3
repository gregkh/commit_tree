bpf: Add bpf_ktime_get_coarse_ns helper

The helper uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE source of time that is less
accurate but more performant.

We have a BPF CGROUP_SKB firewall that supports event logging through
bpf_perf_event_output(). Each event has a timestamp and currently we use
bpf_ktime_get_ns() for it. Use of bpf_ktime_get_coarse_ns() saves ~15-20
ns in time required for event logging.

bpf_ktime_get_ns():
EgressLogByRemoteEndpoint                              113.82ns    8.79M

bpf_ktime_get_coarse_ns():
EgressLogByRemoteEndpoint                               95.40ns   10.48M
