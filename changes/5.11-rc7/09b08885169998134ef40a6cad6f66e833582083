crypto: qat - change admin sequence

Call adf_set_fw_constants() before adf_init_ae().

This is required by QAT GEN4 devices, which expect that the
FW_CONSTANTS_CFG command is sent to the admin AEs before the FW_INIT_AE
command.

Swapping the order of the two commands (FW_INIT_AE and FW_CONSTANTS_CFG)
is allowed in QAT GEN2 devices as the firmware can handle those in any
order.
