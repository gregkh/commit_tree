cap: fix conversions on getxattr

If a capability is stored on disk in v2 format cap_inode_getsecurity() will
currently return in v2 format unconditionally.

This is wrong: v2 cap should be equivalent to a v3 cap with zero rootid,
and so the same conversions performed on it.

If the rootid cannot be mapped, v3 is returned unconverted.  Fix this so
that both v2 and v3 return -EOVERFLOW if the rootid (or the owner of the fs
user namespace in case of v2) cannot be mapped into the current user
namespace.
