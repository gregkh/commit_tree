scripts: kernel-doc: fix parsing function-like typedefs

Changeset 6b80975c6308 ("scripts: kernel-doc: fix typedef parsing")
added support for things like:

	typedef unsigned long foo();

However, it caused a regression on this prototype:

	typedef bool v4l2_check_dv_timings_fnc(const struct v4l2_dv_timings *t, void *handle);

This is only noticed after adding a patch that checks if the
kernel-doc identifier matches the typedef:

	./scripts/kernel-doc -none $(git grep '^.. kernel-doc::' Documentation/ |cut -d ' ' -f 3|sort|uniq) 2>&1|grep expecting
	include/media/v4l2-dv-timings.h:38: warning: expecting prototype for typedef v4l2_check_dv_timings_fnc. Prototype was for typedef nc instead

The problem is that, with the new parsing logic, it is not
checking for complete words at the type part.

Fix it by adding a \b at the end of each type word at the
regex.
