arm64: make atomic helpers __always_inline

With UBSAN enabled and building with clang, there are occasionally
warnings like

WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text+0xc533ec): Section mismatch in reference from the function arch_atomic64_or() to the variable .init.data:numa_nodes_parsed
The function arch_atomic64_or() references
the variable __initdata numa_nodes_parsed.
This is often because arch_atomic64_or lacks a __initdata
annotation or the annotation of numa_nodes_parsed is wrong.

for functions that end up not being inlined as intended but operating
on __initdata variables. Mark these as __always_inline, along with
the corresponding asm-generic wrappers.
