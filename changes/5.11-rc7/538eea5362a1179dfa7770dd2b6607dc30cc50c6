ARM: 9043/1: tegra: Fix misplaced tegra_uart_config in decompressor

The tegra_uart_config of the DEBUG_LL code is now placed right at the
start of the .text section after commit which enabled debug output in the
decompressor. Tegra devices are not booting anymore if DEBUG_LL is enabled
since tegra_uart_config data is executes as a code. Fix the misplaced
tegra_uart_config storage by embedding it into the code.
