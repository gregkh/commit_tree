ASoC: qcom: lpass: Fix out-of-bounds DAI ID lookup

The "dai_id" given into LPAIF_INTFDMA_REG(...) is already the real
DAI ID, not an index into v->dai_driver. Looking it up again seems
entirely redundant.

For IPQ806x (and SC7180 since commit 09a4f6f5d21c
("ASoC: dt-bindings: lpass: Fix and common up lpass dai ids") this is
now often an out-of-bounds read because the indexes in the "dai_driver"
array no longer match the actual DAI ID.
