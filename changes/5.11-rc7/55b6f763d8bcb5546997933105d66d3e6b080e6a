init/gcov: allow CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS on UML to fix module gcov

On ARCH=um, loading a module doesn't result in its constructors getting
called, which breaks module gcov since the debugfs files are never
registered.  On the other hand, in-kernel constructors have already been
called by the dynamic linker, so we can't call them again.

Get out of this conundrum by allowing CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS to be
selected, but avoiding the in-kernel constructor calls.

Also remove the "if !UML" from GCOV selecting CONSTRUCTORS now, since we
really do want CONSTRUCTORS, just not kernel binary ones.
