dt-bindings: remoteproc: k3-r5f: Update bindings for J7200 SoCs

The TI K3 J7200 SoCs have two dual-core Arm R5F clusters/subsystems,
with 2 R5F cores each, one in each of the MCU and MAIN voltage domains.

These clusters are a revised IP version compared to those present on
J721E SoCs. Update the K3 R5F remoteproc bindings with the compatible
info relevant to these R5F clusters/subsystems on K3 J7200 SoCs.
