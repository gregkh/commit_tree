xfs: delete duplicated tp->t_dqinfo null check and allocation

The function xfs_trans_mod_dquot_byino() wraps around
xfs_trans_mod_dquot() to account for quotas, and also there is the
function call chain xfs_trans_reserve_quota_bydquots -> xfs_trans_dqresv
-> xfs_trans_mod_dquot, both of them do the duplicated null check and
allocation. Thus we can delete the duplicated operation from them.
