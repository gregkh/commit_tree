mm/gup: combine put_compound_head() and unpin_user_page()

These functions accomplish the same thing but have different
implementations.

unpin_user_page() has a bug where it calls mod_node_page_state() after
calling put_page() which creates a risk that the page could have been
hot-uplugged from the system.

Fix this by using put_compound_head() as the only implementation.

__unpin_devmap_managed_user_page() and related can be deleted as well in
favour of the simpler, but slower, version in put_compound_head() that has
an extra atomic page_ref_sub, but always calls put_page() which internally
contains the special devmap code.

Move put_compound_head() to be directly after try_grab_compound_head() so
people can find it in future.
