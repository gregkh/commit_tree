driver core: Allow only unprobed consumers for SYNC_STATE_ONLY device links

SYNC_STATE_ONLY device links only affect the behavior of sync_state()
callbacks. Specifically, they prevent sync_state() only callbacks from
being called on a device if one or more of its consumers haven't probed.

So, creating a SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link from an already probed
consumer is useless. So, don't allow creating such device links.
