drm/i915: Fix DMA mapped scatterlist lookup

As the previous patch fixed the places where we walk the whole scatterlist
for DMA addresses, this patch fixes the random lookup functionality.

To achieve this we have to add a second lookup iterator and add a
i915_gem_object_get_sg_dma helper, to be used analoguous to existing
i915_gem_object_get_sg_dma. Therefore two lookup caches are maintained per
object and they are flushed at the same point for simplicity. (Strictly
speaking the DMA cache should be flushed from i915_gem_gtt_finish_pages,
but today this conincides with unsetting of the pages in general.)

Partial VMA view is then fixed to use the new DMA lookup and properly
query sg length.

v2:
 * Checkpatch.
