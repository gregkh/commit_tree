scsi: aacraid: Drop pci_enable_wake() from .resume

The driver calls pci_enable_wake(...., false) in aac_resume(), and there is
no corresponding pci_enable_wake(...., true) in aac_suspend(). Either it
should do enable-wake the device in .suspend() or should not invoke
pci_enable_wake() at all.

Concluding that this is a bug and PCI core calls pci_enable_wake(pci_dev,
PCI_D0, false) during resume, drop it from aac_resume().
