arm64: dts: hisilicon: normalize the node name of the ITS devices

Change the node name of the ITS devices to match
"^(msi-controller|gic-its|interrupt-controller)@[0-9a-f]+$". Although
"interrupt-controller" is allowed, but "msi-controller" is preferred.
Otherwise, "interrupt-controller@b7000000: False schema does not allow"
will be reported by arm,gic-v3.yaml.
