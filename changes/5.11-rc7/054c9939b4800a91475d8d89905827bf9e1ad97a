mac80211: pause TX while changing interface type

syzbot reported a crash that happened when changing the interface
type around a lot, and while it might have been easy to fix just
the symptom there, a little deeper investigation found that really
the reason is that we allowed packets to be transmitted while in
the middle of changing the interface type.

Disallow TX by stopping the queues while changing the type.
