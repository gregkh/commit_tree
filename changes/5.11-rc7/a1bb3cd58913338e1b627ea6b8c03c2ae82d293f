io_uring: fix __io_uring_files_cancel() with TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE

If the tctx inflight number haven't changed because of cancellation,
__io_uring_task_cancel() will continue leaving the task in
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state, that's not expected by
__io_uring_files_cancel(). Ensure we always call finish_wait() before
retrying.
