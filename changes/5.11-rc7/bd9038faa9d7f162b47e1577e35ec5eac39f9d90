ASoC: SOF: Intel: soundwire: fix select/depend unmet dependencies

The LKP bot reports the following issue:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SOUNDWIRE_INTEL
  Depends on [m]: SOUNDWIRE [=m] && ACPI [=y] && SND_SOC [=y]
  Selected by [y]:
  - SND_SOC_SOF_INTEL_SOUNDWIRE [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML &&
  SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_SOC_SOF_TOPLEVEL [=y] &&
  SND_SOC_SOF_INTEL_TOPLEVEL [=y] && SND_SOC_SOF_INTEL_PCI [=y]

This comes from having tristates being configured independently, when
in practice the CONFIG_SOUNDWIRE needs to be aligned with the SOF
choices: when the SOF code is compiled as built-in, the
CONFIG_SOUNDWIRE also needs to be 'y'.

The easiest fix is to replace the 'depends' with a 'select' and have a
single user selection to activate SoundWire on Intel platforms. This
still allows regmap to be compiled independently as a module.

This is just a temporary fix, the select/depend usage will be
revisited and the SOF Kconfig re-organized, as suggested by Arnd
Bergman.
