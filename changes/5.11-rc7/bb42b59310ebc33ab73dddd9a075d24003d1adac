pinctrl: ingenic: Get rid of repetitive data

Abuse the pin function pointer to store the pin function value directly,
when all the pins of a group have the same function value. Now when the
pointer value is <= 3 (unsigned), the pointer value is used as the pin
function; otherwise it is used as a regular pointer.

This drastically reduces the number of pin function tables needed, and
drops .data usage by about 2 KiB. Additionally, the few pin function
tables that are still around now contain u8 instead of int, since the
largest number that will be stored is 3.
