igc: fix link speed advertising

Link speed advertising in igc has two problems:

- When setting the advertisement via ethtool, the link speed is converted
  to the legacy 32 bit representation for the intel PHY code.
  This inadvertently drops ETHTOOL_LINK_MODE_2500baseT_Full_BIT (being
  beyond bit 31).  As a result, any call to `ethtool -s ...' drops the
  2500Mbit/s link speed from the PHY settings.  Only reloading the driver
  alleviates that problem.

  Fix this by converting the ETHTOOL_LINK_MODE_2500baseT_Full_BIT to the
  Intel PHY ADVERTISE_2500_FULL bit explicitly.

- Rather than checking the actual PHY setting, the .get_link_ksettings
  function always fills link_modes.advertising with all link speeds
  the device is capable of.

  Fix this by checking the PHY autoneg_advertised settings and report
  only the actually advertised speeds up to ethtool.
