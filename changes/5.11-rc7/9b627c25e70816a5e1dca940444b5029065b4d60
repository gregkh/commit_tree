bus: mhi: core: Remove double locking from mhi_driver_remove()

There is double acquisition of the pm_lock from mhi_driver_remove()
function. Remove the read_lock_bh/read_unlock_bh calls for pm_lock
taken during a call to mhi_device_put() as the lock is acquired
within the function already. This will help avoid a potential
kernel panic.
