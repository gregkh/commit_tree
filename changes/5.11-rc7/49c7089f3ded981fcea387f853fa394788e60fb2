null_blk: cleanup discard handling

null_handle_discard() is called from both null_handle_rq() and
null_handle_bio(). As these functions are only passed a nullb_cmd
structure, this forces pointer dereferences to identiify the discard
operation code and to access the sector range to be discarded.
Simplify all this by changing the interface of the functions
null_handle_discard() and null_handle_memory_backed() to pass along
the operation code, operation start sector and number of sectors. With
this change null_handle_discard() can be called directly from
null_handle_memory_backed().

Also add a message warning that the discard configuration attribute has
no effect when memory backing is disabled.

No functional change is introduced by this patch.
