memory: tegra: Add missing latency allowness entry for Page Table Cache

Add missing PTC memory client latency allowness entry to the Tegra MC
drivers.

This prevents erroneous clearing of MC_INTSTATUS 0x0 register during
of the LA programming in tegra_mc_setup_latency_allowance() due to the
missing entry. Note that this patch doesn't fix any known problems.
