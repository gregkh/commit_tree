net: ipa: fix interconnect enable bug

When the core clock rate and interconnect bandwidth specifications
were moved into configuration data, a copy/paste bug was introduced,
causing the memory interconnect bandwidth to be set three times
rather than enabling the three different interconnects.

Fix this bug.
