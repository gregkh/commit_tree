ALSA: hda/realtek: Apply jack fixup for Quanta NL3

The Quanta NL3 laptop has both a headphone output jack and a headset
jack, on the right edge of the chassis.

The pin information suggests that both of these are at the Front.
The PulseAudio is confused to differentiate them so one of the jack
can neither get the jack sense working nor the audio output.

The ALC269_FIXUP_LIFEBOOK chained with ALC269_FIXUP_QUANTA_MUTE can
help to differentiate 2 jacks and get the 'Auto-Mute Mode' working
correctly.
