mptcp: fix pending data accounting

When sendmsg() needs to wait for memory, the pending data
is not updated. That causes a drift in forward memory allocation,
leading to stall and/or warnings at socket close time.

This change addresses the above issue moving the pending data
counter update inside the sendmsg() main loop.
