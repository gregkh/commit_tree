drm/amd/display: handler not correctly checked at remove_irq_handler

[why]
handler is supposedly passed in as a function pointer;
however, the entire struct amdgpu_dm_irq_handler_data
gets from the list is used to check match.

[how]
use the interrupt_handler within amdgpu_dm_irq_handler_data
for checking match.
