bpf: Fix the irq and nmi check in bpf_sk_storage for tracing usage

The intention of the current check is to avoid using bpf_sk_storage
in irq and nmi.  Jakub pointed out that the current check cannot
do that.  For example, in_serving_softirq() returns true
if the softirq handling is interrupted by hard irq.
